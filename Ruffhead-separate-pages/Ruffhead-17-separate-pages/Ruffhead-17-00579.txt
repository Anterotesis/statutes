4 two hundred Pounds for every one hundred Pounds of such Capital Stock; and that if at the Time of the

4 Right and T itle of the said United Company to the said whole, foie, and exclusive Trade (limited as in the

4 said Act is mentioned) becoming determined, their own Funds and Assets, Real ahd Personal, should be in-

4 sufficient to pay and Tatisfyall their just Debts, and to make good to the said Company their said Capital

4 Stock, or the Value thereof, computing the fame after the Rate of two hundred Pounds for every one hun-

4 died Pounds of the said Stock, that then the said Capital Stock of Annuities, or Guarantee Fund, should

4 be deemed and considered, as far as the fame should or might extend for that Purpose, to be, in the first Place,

and before any other Application thereof, subjebl and liable to make good to the said Company and their

4 Creditors the Deficiency fp arising in their own Funds and Efledls for the Purpose aforesaid; and that the

4 said Capital Stock of Annuities, or the Surplus thereof, after making good such Deficiency (if any such

4 there should be) {hould remain and continue as a Guarantee Fund, for the better securing the Capital Stock

4 of the said United Company, or the Value thereof, rating the fame as aforesaid, after such Determination

4 of their whole, foie, and exclusive Trade, for so long Time as they should continue to trade with a Joint

4 Stock, and subject thereto; and after making good all such Deficiencies, the said Capital Stock of Annui-

4 ties, or so much thereof as should then remain, should be and be deemed the Property of the Public; as by

the said recited Act may appear: And whereas it is just and expedient that, after the Stock of the said Com-

4 pany shall be increased, the said Guarantee Fund should be also increased, so as to give the Proprietors of the

4 said increased Stock the fame Security and Benefit as the Proprietors of the present Stock of the said Com-

4 pany are entitled to :9 Be it therefore further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That, from Time to Time

when and as the said Company’s Stock shall be increased, the said Fund, in the said recited Act, called

The Guarantee Fund, shall also be increased, by the Means and in the Manner in which the said Guarantee

Fund of twelve millions of Pounds Sterling is to be raised, so that the fame may amount to the Sum of the

Capital Stock of the said Company, computing the fame at such Rate as in the said recited Act is men-

tioned; and the said Guarantee Fund, so increased as aforesaid, shall be subject unto and a Security for such

Payments, and shall be applied in the same Manner in every Respect, to all Intents and Purposes, as the

said Guarantee Fund is directed to be paid and applied, so as to secure and make good to the Creditors of

the said Company any Deficiency of their Funds for the Payment of Debts, and also any Deficiency to the

Proprietors of the said increased Stock, as well as the Proprietors of the present Stock of the said Company,

of the said Dividend of ten Pounds per Centum, and of the Value of the said Stock, at the Times and under

the Circumstances in the said Act mentioned, rating such Value at two hundred Pounds for every one

hundred Pounds Capital Stock, as in the said Act is mentioned.

IX. And whereas, by the said Abl made in the thirty-third Year of the Reign of his present Majesty

4.taking Notice of a Fund separately belonging to the said United Company, and therein called The Company's

4 separate Fund,it was enacted, that the said separate Fund, or the Monies constituting the fame, should con-

4 tinue in the Hands of the said Company, bearing Interest, and be employed in their Trade, subject to the

1 Payment of such Dividends as were therein-after l’pecified; and that the said separate Fund, wirh the grotv-

4 ing Interest thereof, should be divided and distributed in the Manner therein aftei mentioned, and in no other

4 Manner whatsoever, that is to lay, that after Payment should be made by the Company into his Majesty’s

4 Exchequer of the two first Instalments of two hundred and fifty thousand Pounds each, which by force and

4 virtue of that Act would become due from the said Company to the Public on the first Day of July one

4 thousand seven hundred and ninety-three, and the first Day of January one thousand seven hundred and

4 ninety-four, respectively, or otherwise, after setting apart a luftkient Sum for such Payments, (which said

4 Payments were duly made agreeable to the Provision of the said Act,) it should be lawful for the said Com-

4 pany, out of the said separate Fund, and the Interest or growing Income thereof, to make and declare a

4 Dividend or Dividends after the Rate of ten Shillings per Centum per Annum on the present or any future

4 Amount of their Capital Stock, which said Dividend or Dividends should be paid and payable to the said

4 Company over and above any other Dividend or Dividends which should becomedue in respect thereof;

and that v.fter the Expiration of the further Term thereby granted in the said exclusive Trade, it should be

4 lawful for the saul Company to retain and dispose of what should then remain of the said Company’s separate

4 I* und, or of the Monies constituting the fame, and the Interest or other Annual Proceeds thereof, in such

4 Manner as they should then think fit: And whereas the Payment of the said Dividend of ten Shil!ings/vr

4 fJentum to the Proprietors of the said increased Stock out of the said separate Fund as in the said recited Ablis

4 mentioned, will exhaust the fame long before the Expiration of the Term of the said exclusive Trade, to the

4 Injury of the prefenc Proprietors of the Stock of the said Company, who would thereby be deprived of such

4 Dividend for the Remainder of the said Term, and in regard the Money to be raised by the said increased

4 Stock is for the mutual Benefit of the Public and the said United Company, it is fit that the said Dividend

4 should be considered as a Charge upon the said Trade ;* be it therefore further enabled by the Authority afore-

said, I hat the said Dividend of I'en Shillings/ter Centum, which under the Authority of the said recited Act

will be payable to the Proprietors of the said increased Stock out of the said separate Fund, shall be paid to

them out of the Annual Profits of the said Company, in the fame Maimer, and at the fame 7'imes, as the

Dividend of ten Pounds per Centum in the said Act mentioned is to be paid to the Proprietors of the Stacc

of the said Company; and for that Purpose a Sum equal to the Amount of such Dividends shall, from Time

to Time) be debited to the Annual Account, as a Charge on the said Trade, and carried to the Account of

the said separate Fund; any Thing in the said recited Act to the contrary notwithstanding.

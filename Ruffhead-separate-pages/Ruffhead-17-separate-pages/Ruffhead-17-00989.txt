immediately before fitting such Assize, while such additional Duties on Salt shall continue, but no longer,

add to what shall, by Means of the then lad General Return or Account of Wheat, appear to be the then

Average Price per Quarter of Wheat tit for the making of Wheaten Bread, the Sum of Five-pence on Ac-

count of the said new Duties on Salt, foas to increase such Average Price Five-pence per Quarter; and shall

then, in setting the Assize of Bread, make use of such ir.creased Average Price or Surp in (lead of the real

Average Price, in such and the same Manner, in all Respects, as if the fame were the real Average Price of

Wheat, according to the then last General Return or Account of Wheat; and that, from Time to Time,

when and so often as the said Court of Mayor and Aldermen, or Lord Mayor, shall, in letting the Assize of

Bread in execution of the fame two A 6b, think proper to use or be guided by the Average Price of Flour,

they or he shall, immediately before setting such Assize, while such additional Duties on bale shall continue,

but no longer, add to what shall, by Means of the then last General Return or Account of Meal and Flour,

appear to be the then Average Price per Sack of Flour, fit for the making of Wheaten Bread, the Sum of

hour-pence on Account of the said new Duties on Salt, foas toincrease such Average Price Four-pence per

Sack, and shall then, in setting the Afiize of Bread, make use of such increased Average PriceorSum

real Average Price of Flour, according to the then last General Return or Account of Meal and Flour made

of Wheat.

IX. 4 And whereas in setting the Assize of Bread in Conformity to the Directions of the said Act of

4 the thirty-seventh Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, it frequently happens that the Average Price

4 of Wheat or of Flour returned does not agree with any of the Prices specified in the Table affixed to the

4 said Act from which the Assize of Bread is directed to be set, and the Assize is then set from the Price

4 in the said Table nearest the said Average Price returned, by reason whereof the Assize and Price of Bread

4 is at Times higher than by the said Act is intended, to the Injury of the Public, and at other Times not

4 so high, to the Injury of the Baker for Remedy whereof, be it enacted, That whenever there shall be

any Difference between the Average Price of Wheat or of Flour returned, and the Price from which the

Assize of Bread shall be set, the Amount of such Difference of Price shall be entered in a Book to be kept

at the Cocket Office aforesaid for that Purpose ; and when and so often as it shall appear that upon such

Differences being added together they amount to a sufficient Sum, either in Favour of the Public or of

the Baker, to make a Variation in the Price of Bread of Half an Assize, then and so often the said Court

of Mayor and Aldermen, if the said Court shall then fit, and if such Court shall not then fit, then the Lord

Mayor of the said City for the Time being shall, and they or he are or is hereby required to make such

Addition to, or Deduction from, the Average Pi ice of Wheat or of Flour returned, and in setting the then

next Assize of Bread, either to lower or to raise the fame one Half an. Assize, as the Cafe may require,

accordingly, as the Difference between the Average Prices of Wheat or of Flour returned, and the Prices

from which the Assize shall have been set, appears to have been in Favour of the Public or of the Baker.

X. And be it further enacted, That such Part or Parts of any Act or Acts of Parliament heretofore

made, whereby a Penalty or Penalties is or are inflicted on Bakers neglecting to mark their Loaves as

thereby directed shall, as to Bakers making, or who shall make. Bread for Sale within the City of London,

tioned Limits, any Loaf of any Sort of Bread then allowed to be'made in pursuance of any A6tor Acts

of Parliament, and which shall not be marked pursuant to the Directions of this Act, so as that it may

on the View thereof be ascertained from Time to Lime under what Denomination or Sort of Bread every

such Loaf was made, and ought to be weighed, (except as to Loaves which shall be ralped after the be-

('peaking or purchasing thereof by the particular Desire of any Person who shall order the fame to be so

rasped for his, her, or their own U/e or Uses,) shall for every Time tie, (lie, or fney shall offend in the

4 Tons having cerrtain Parts of the said Stocks or Annuities transferable at the Bank of standing in

4 ferrable at the Bank of England, standing in the Names of such Lunatics in their own Right, and the

4 Committees of the Estates of such Lunatics having like Parts of such Stocks and Annuities standing in

4 their own Names in Fruit for or as Part of the Property of such Lunatics, have sometimes died intestate,

4 or gone to relide beyond the Seas, or have themselves become Lunatics, or it has been uncertain and un-

4 known whether they were living or dead: And whereas it is sometimes proper arid expedient that such Parts

4 of the Property of such Lunatics as aforesaid should be transferred, but by the Laws in being no valid or

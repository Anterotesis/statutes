4 lawful, upon Complaint made by the Churchwardens or Overseers of the Poor of any Parish, to any

4 Justice ol the Peace, within forty Days after any such Person or Persons coming so to settle as aforesaid,

in any Tenement under the yearly Value of ten Pounds, for any two Justices of the Peace, whereof one

4 to be of the Quorum, of the Division where any Person or Persons that are likely to be chargeable to the

1 Parish shall come to inhabit, by their Warrant, to remove and convey such Person or Persons to such Pa-

4 rish where he or they were last legally settled, either as a- Native, Householder, Sojourner, Apprentice, or

4 Servant, for the Space of forty Days at the least, unless he or they give sufficient Security for the

4 Discharge of the said Parish, to be allowed by the said Justices: And whereas many industrious poor

4 Persons, chargeable to the Parish, Township, or Place^ where they live merely from Want of Work

4 there, would in any other Place, where sufficient Employment is to be had, maintain themfdvesand Fa-

4 milies without being burthensome to any Parish, Township, or Place; and such poor Persons are for the

4 most Part compelled to live in their own Parishes, Townships, or Places, and are not permitted to inha-

4 bit elsewhere, under Pietence that they are likely to become chargeable to the Parish, Township, or

4 Place, into which they go for the Purpose of getting Employment, although the Labour of such poor

4 Persons might, in many Instances, be very beneficial to such Parish, Township, or Place: And whereas

the Remedy intended to be applied thereto, by the granting of Certificates, in pursuance of the Act passed

in the eighth and ninth Years of the Reign of King JViliiam the Third, intituled, An Act for Juf plying

4 form Defects in the Laws for the Relief of the Poor of this Kingdom, hath been found very ineftedtual;

and it is necessary that other Provisions should be made relating thereto Be it therefore enabled by the

King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,

and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, I hat, from and

after the passing of this Act, so much of the said in Part recited Act of the thirteenth and fourteenth Years

of King Charles the Second, as enables the Justices to remove any Person or Persons that are likely to be

chargeable to the Parish, Township, or Place, into which they shall come to inhabit, shall be, and die

lame is hereby repealed; and that from thenceforth no poor Person shall be removed, by virtue of any Order

of Removal, from the Parish or Place where such poor Person shall be inhabiting, to the Place of his or her

last legal Settlement, until such Person shall have become actually chargeable to the Parish, Township, or

Place, in which such Person shall then inhabit, jn which Cale two Jultlces of the Peace are hereby em-

powered to remove the Person or Persons, in the lame Manner, and subject to the fame Appeal, and with

the lame Powers, as might have been done before the passing of this Act with respect to Persons likely to be-

come chargeable.

II. And whereas poor Persons are often removed or passed to the Place of their Settlement during the

4 Time of their Sickness, to the great Danger of their Lives for Remedy thereof, be it further enacted by

the Authority aforesaid, That in case any poor Person shall from henceforth be brought before any Justice

or Justices of the Peace, for the Purpose of being removed from the Place where he or she is inhabiting

or sojourning, by virtue of any Order of Removal, or of being passed by virtue of any Vagrant Pass, and

it shall appear to the said Justice or Justices that such poor Person is unable to travel, by reaion of Sickness

cr other Infirmity, or that it would be dangerous for him or her so to do, the Justice or Justices making

such Order of Removal, or granting such Vagrant Pass, are hereby required and authorized tosuspend the

Execution of the fame until they are satisfied that it may safely be executed, without Danger to any Person

who is the Subject thereof; which Suspension of, and subsequent Permi.Tien to execute the fame, shall be rc-

fpcdively indorsed on the said Order of Removal, or Vagrant Pass, and signed by such Justice or Justices ;

and no Ad done by any such poor Person continuing to reside in any Parish, Township, or Place, un-

der the Suspension of any such Order, shall beeftedual, either in the Whole or in Part, lor the Purpose of

eivine him or her a Settlement in the fame; and the Charges proved upon Oath to have been incurred by

such Suipenlion of any Qrdei of Removal may, by the said [ultices, be diredeeftobe paid by tfic~ChurcK-

wardens and Overseers of the Parish or Place to which such poor Person is ordered to be removed, in case

any Removal shall take place, or in case of the Death of such poor Person before the Execution of such Or-

der; and if the Churchwardens or Overseers of the Parish, Township, or Place, to which the Order of Re-

moval shall be made, or any or either of them, shall, upon the Removal or Death of such poor Person or-

dered to be removed, refuse or neglect to pay the said Charges within three Days after Qemand thereof, and

shall not within the lame Time give Notice of Appeal as is herein-after mentioned, !t shall and may be law-

ful for one Justice of the Peace, by Warrant under his Hand and Seal, to cause the Money mentioned in

such Order to be levied by Distress and Sale of the Goods and Chattels of the Person or Persons so refusing

or neglecting Payment of the fame, and also such Colls attending the fame, not exceeding forty Shillings,

as such Justice shall direct; and if the Parish, 'Township, or Place, to which the Removal of such poor

Person is made, or was ordered to be made, before the Death of such Person as aforesaid, be without the

lien of the Justice of the Peace issuing the Warrant, then such Warrant shall be transmitted to any

of the Peace having JurisditSlion within such Parish, Township, or Place as aforesaid, who, upon

itaereof, is hereby authorized and required to indorse the fame for Execution: Provided nevertheless,

that il the Sum so ordered to be paid on Account of such Colls and Charges exceed the Sum of twenty

Pounds, ti.^r Party or Parties aggrieved by such Order may appeal to the next General Quarter Sdlions

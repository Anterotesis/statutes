come so foul and impure, as to be utterly unfit to be again used in or applied to the Purpose of salting or

curing Fish : Provided always, That if any Person, whether a Fish Curer or not, shall be convicted before

fuftering any such foul Fishery Salt to be sold, disposed of, or used, for any other Purpose than that of

manuiing Land, or of felling or disposing of or using any Salt for the Purpose of manuring Land, except

such Salt as, by such repeated Use and Application as aforesaid, shall have become so foul, dirty, and im-

pure, as to be totally unfit to be used or employed in salting or curing Fish, every such Person shall, for

Proviso, cause a particular Description of the said Invention to be inrolled in the said High Court of Chan-

ccry, upon the twenty- third Day of April in the Year of our Lord one thousand (even hundred and

eighty-two; which Description is in the Words and Form, or to the Effecl following; (that is to say,)

u The said Invention consists of a Kiln and Oven so contrived that the fame Fire is made to serve at the

44 fame Timethe

44 sufficient for d

44 Coal, is not w;

u

il

acquires rather an additional Vs$uc, in some Places to a considerable Amount. The Oven, which should

be made of good IVindjor or other Bricks, bed able to rchft the Force of the Fire, has a dead or flat

44 Hearth, on which the Coal is laid. Near the said Oven, and mod conveniently opposite to tho Mouth

*4 of it, a Lime Kiln is placed, the Bottom of which may be on a Level with the Floor of the Oven,

44 having an Opening into the Oven, through which the Flame or Heat is drawn into the Bottom or lower

44 Part of the Lime Kiln, which being fornething narrower below, should be nearly cylindrical, or rather

44 drawing inward above, so as to give the greateit Effect to the Heat: Over the Kiln and Oven are placed

44 the Stills or other Vessels propoled to be employed, in such Manner as not to be immediately open to the

44 Fire in the Oven or the burning Lime, but to receive their Heat through Flues disposed and governed by

" iiz *ifters inserted in them, in such Manner as to increase or moderate the Heat in esrch Part at Pleasure,

so*&at the different Operations by the Stills or Boilers et catera, may be carried on independent of each

44 Other; for ,fhis End both the Oven and Kiln should have strong and thick Crowns or Coves, at the

" fprinrHne of w’hich the Flues may most conveniently be made, through which the Flame or Heat is to be

conveyed to th-' Stills or Coppers placed over them, or, if thought necessary, a double or false Crown

mient he *dderT/r. as more effectually to repress the Heat when required; observing, that when the

Vefie! over the Over is to be kept cool, the Registers of the Flues leading to it from the Oven are to be

tnc uvet ^ conffinej to the Lime Kiln alone; and when the Veil'd ov.

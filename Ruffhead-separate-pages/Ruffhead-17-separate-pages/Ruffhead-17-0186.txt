4 hundred and eighty-six, in the fame Words and Form, and to the fame EfFecfl, as that herein-above men-

4 tinned as inrolled in the High Court of Chancery of England: And whereas the said Invention, in the'

4 Opinion of competent Judges, who have inspecded the fume, and examined the said HeUry Seymour Conway

1 Method of conducting the Process thereof for the Purposes above mentioned, and also of other Persons who

4 haveadtually used the fame, will be attended with many beneficial Consequences to the Public, as thereby

4 the Kxpence of the Whole or the greatest Part of the Fuel used in those Processes to which the fame

Invention is applicable will be effectually saved, and in some Cafes a Gain or Profit will be absolutely

4 obtained upon the Fuel so employed : And whereas the said Henry Seymour Conway devoted a very consider-

f able Portion of l ime, and expended very large Sums of Money, to the Detriment of his private Fortune,

4 in bringing his said Invention to Peifeftion; but notwithstanding the Advantages resulting to the Public

4 from the Use of the said Invention, and although thirteen Years of the Term contained in the said first-

4 mentioned Letters Patent, and nine Years of the Second, are elapsed, he has not been able hitherto to

4 reimburse himself the great Expence which he has incurred: And whereas, upon the Expiration of the said

4 Letters Patent, which will happen the first within one Year, and the latter within five Years from the

4 present Time, the Public at large will (unless restricted) be entitled to use and exercise the Invention thereby

4 i’fcured, which will be a very great Prejudice to the said Henry Seymour Conway, and deprive him of the

4 Means of reimbursing himself the Expences which he has sustained in bringing his laid Invention to

4 Perfection ; and asfeveral Years may elapfc before the Use of the said Invention can become so general as to

4 produce any considerable Profit, the Expiration of the said Letters Patent will entirely prevent him from

being reimbursed his said Expences; And whereas the said Henry Seymour Conway, under these Circum-

stances, is induced to apply to the Legislature to have the Terms granted by the said Letters Patent

reimbursed

employed

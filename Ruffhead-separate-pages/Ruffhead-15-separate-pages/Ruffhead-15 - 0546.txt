4 London Coal Buyers, at stated Periods; which Allowances have constituted the principal Part of the rea-

4 sonable Profits of the London Coal Buyers, yet great Numbers of Actions have been commenced against

4 various Persons in the said Trade, as well Owners as Buyers, on the Ground that such Allowances are con-

4 trary to the two Clauses of the said Acts above recited: And whereas the Persons against whom the said

4 Actions arc brought, did not introduce the Practice complained of, but found it an existing Custom prevalent

4 have been brought :* In order, therefore, to prevent so much Mischief, Litigation, and Expence, may it

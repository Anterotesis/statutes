4 Act to render mere effectual an Act passed in the twenty sixth Tear of his present Majesty* s Reign, intit uledy

44 An Act for eretiing certain Lighthcsfes in the Northern Parts of Great Britain,” certain additional Powers

4 and Authorities were given to the said Commissioners: And whereas the four Lighthouses therein described

4 have been erected, and particularly a Lighthouse at a Place called The Merchants, on the South-welt

4 Point of the Mull of Khityrc, which is found to be of great Importance to the Navigation of Skips

4 passing to and from the Northern Channel, but not to Ships pa ding to and from the Frith of Clyd<\

4 through the Southern Channel: And whereas it would conduce greatly to the Security of such Navi*

4 gation through the Southern Channel, if another Lighthoule was erected upon the South End of the

4 Island of Arran, or upon the little llland of Pladay near the fame* which may be done without any In-

4 crease of the Duties authorised to be levied by the said two recited Adb :* May it therefore please your

Majesty that it may be enacted ; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the

Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament

assembled, and by the Authority of the same, "That it shall and may be lawful to and for the said Com-

missioners, or any five or more of them, to crcdl, or cause to be erected, a Lighthouse in a convenient

Situation upon the South End of the Island of Arran, or upon the llland of Piada near the fame, with such

other Buildings and Conveniencies as to them shall appear necessary ; and also to erect, or cause to be erected,

a Bread or Wharf for landing Materials ncccllaty for the building and maintaining the said Lighthouser

and to make, or cause to be made, a Road or Roads from the said Bread or Wharf to the said Lighthouse,

and to contract and agree with the Owner or Owners and Occupiers of Lands, lying and fttuated at the

Places aforesaid, and tnod convenient for erecting the said Lighthouse and other Accommodations, for

so much Land as may be necessary for the said Purposes, and shall pay such Rate and Con fide ration

for the fame as shall be agreed on between the said Commissioners and the Owner or Owners and

Occupiers of such Lands, either by absolute Purchase, or by Payment of a Rent or certain annual Sum for

the fame.

II. 4 And whereas it may happen th2t the'Owner or Owners, or Occupier or Occupiers of such Land

4 may infid on too high Prices or Rents for the fame, or through Infancy, Minority, Defe<3 of the Title

4 Deeds, Incumbrances, Debts, or other Disabilities or causes, it may be difficult to obtain valid and legal

4 Rights to some of the Properties necessary to be used for these Purposes:* For Remedy whereof, be it

enabled by the Authority aforesaid, That under any of the Circumstances before described, it shall be law-

ful for the said Commissioners, and they are hereby authorised to apply to the Sheriff Depute of the County

where the Lands lie, and to proceed in the Manner directed by the Lid first-mentioned Act, in order to have

the Values thereof ascertained and the Right made effectual; and the several Powers and Authorities which

are conferred upon them by the said two recited Acts, are hereby also given, and the fame Modes of proceed-

ing shall be followed relative to the aforesaid fifth Lighthouse, as with regard to the others already erected, no

higher Duties being exigible for the whole five Lighthouses than those authorised by the said last-mentioned

Ad, but which Duties shall be wholly exigible at the l imes and in the Manner specified in the said last-

recited Act, without waiting till the fifth Lighthouse authorised by this present Act shall be completed.

III. 4 And v hereas it may be necessary, for the Purpose of completing the said fifth Lighthouse, to borrow

4 a further Sum of Money,* be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the said Commissioners, or any

five or more of them, shall be, and they are hereby impowered and declared to have full Power and lawful

Authority at any Time or Times hereafter, by any Mortgage or Mortgages, or any Act or Acts, Deed or

Deeds, under their Hands duly executed, to borrow or take up at a Rate of Interest not exceeding the law-

ful Interest, in addition to the Sums allowed to be taken up and borrowed by the said Acts, a further Sum

not exceeding two thousand Pounds Sterling, upon the Security and Credit of the Duties granted as afore-

feid, for answering the Expence of making and completing the Lid Lighthouse and other Works, and such

further Sum as shall be sufficient to discharge the Expence of obtaining arid passing this Act j and may assign

such Duties to any Person or Persons, Body Politick or Corporate, who shall furniin or advance such Money,

or any Part thereof, as a Security for Repayment of the fame.

IV. 4 And whereas the several Lighthouses already erected have been found of great Benefit to the Navi-

# gation of the North Seas ; and whereas, considering the Danger of navigating these Seas, particularly in

4 the dark tempestuous Season of the Year, more Lighthouses would conduce to trie Safety of Ships, and

4 Preservation of the Lives of Seamen,* be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be

lawful for the said Commissioners, whenever the Produce of the present Duties on the Tonnagfc of Ships will

enable them toeredl other Lighthouses, to cause other such Lighthouses to be ertdted upon any Parts of the

Coast of Scotland as they shall deem to be necessary, and for that Purpose to exerofe the fame Powers which

have been granted for erecting the Lighthouses mentioned in this and the aforesaid Acts of the twenty-sixth

and twenty-eighth Years of his present Majesty’s Reign.

on any Part of the Coast of Scotland, it shall be lawful for the Commissioners for the Time being to cledl the

Provost or Chief Magistrate of the nearest Royal Borough, and also the Sheriff Depute of the nearest County

An Act for incorporating certain Persons therein named, by the Name and Stile of Tbs

British Society for extending the FiJherUs, and improving the Sea Coasts of this Kingdom \

and to enable them, when incorporated, to subscribe a Joint Stock, and therewith to

purchase Lands, and build thereon Free Towns, Villages, and Fishing Stations in

the Highlands and Islands in that Part of Great Britain called Scotland and for other

Purposes.

* XWHEREAS the building of Free Towns, Villages, Harbours, Quays, Piers, and Fishing Sta- preamble.

4 VV tions, in the Highlands and Islands of North Britain, will greatly contribute to the Improvement of

4 Fiftieries, Agriculture, Manufactures, and other useful Objects ofInduftry in that Part of the Kingdom, in

* which the dilperfed Situation of the Inhabitants hath hitherto proved a great Impediment to their active Ex-

c errions ; and their being collected into Fishing Towns and Villages would be the Means of forming a Nur-

4, fery of hardy Seamen for his Majesty’s Navy, and the Defence of the Kingdom : And whereas the finding

c immediate Employment at Home for great Numbers of People, would be the Means of putting a Stop to

4 die dangerous Spirit of Emigration now prevailing, and likely to prevail in a great Degree, to the Depo-

4 pulation of that Part of his Majesty’s Dominions, and Loss to the Kingdom of many of his Majesty’s useful

4 Subjects: And whereas an Undertaking for these laudable Purposes cannot be so conveniently or effectually

4 carried on unless a considerable Joint Stock be raised for that Purpose : And whereas several Persons have

4 already formed themselves into a Society, and subscribed considerable Sums for carrying the Purposes above

V mentioned into Execution, but are apprehensive that Difficulties may arise, as well in recovering Debts

4 which niay grow due to the Joint Stock, as in defending Suits or ACtions which may be commenced or

4 brought against the Subscribers for any Matter or Thing relative to the Joint Society, as by Law all the

4 several Subscribers and Proprietors in the Joint Society mutt, in such Cafes, both sue and be sued, implead

4 and be impleaded, by their several distinct Names and Descriptions, and to prevent the several Subscribers

4 from becoming liable to the Paymept of any Sum or Sums beyond their respective Shares in such Capital

4 Joint Stock; therefore, for the moreeafily carrying into Execution the several Undertakings herein before

4 mentioned, and for avoiding the Difficulties aforesaid, the said Society are desirous of being incorporated,

4 and having a Common Seal and Name, by which they may sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded

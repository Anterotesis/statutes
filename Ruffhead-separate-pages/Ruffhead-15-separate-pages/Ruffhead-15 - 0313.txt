LIX. 4 And whereas, by an Act of the last Session of Parliament, intituled, An At1 for veiling certain

* Sums in Comm'ijjioners, at the End of every garter of a Year, to be by them applied to the Reaudiion of the

4 National Debt, it was provided, that the Sum of two hundred and fifty thousand Pounds shall, at the End

4 of each Quarter, ending the fifth Day of January, the fifth Day of April, the fifth Day of July, and the

4 tenth Day of Oilober, respectively, in every Year, be issued or set apart, at his Majesty's Receipt of Ex-

4 chequer, for the Purpose and in the Manner by the said Act directed; and further Provisions were made

4 in the said Act for the Application, as well of the said Sum of two hundred and fifty thousand Pounds, as of

4 other Sums directed to be placed from Time to Time to the Account of the said Commissionersbe it

therefore further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That, from and after the fifth Day of July one thousand

seven hundred and eighty-seven, the Sum of two hundred and fifty thousand Pounds shall be set apart, out of

the Taxes, Duties, and Revenues composing the Consolidated Fund created by this Act, at the fame Times,

and in the same Manner, and subject to the like Regulations and Provisions as the fame was directed by the

said Act to be issued or set apart out of the Surpluses, Excesses, and Overplus Monies, composing the oink-

ing Fund ; and that all the Sums due in respe& of such Principal or Capital Stock of Pubfick Annuities as

shall be redeemed by virtue of the said Act, and which are thereby directed to be transferred to the Account

of the said Commissioners, and also in respect of any Annuities, the Terms of which shall have expired, and

the Monies now payable thereupon, which are likewise by the said Act directed to be placed to the Account

of the said Commissioners, shall be issued or set apart out of the Taxes, Duties, or Revenues, composing the

Regulations and Provisions contained in the said Act shall remain and be in full Force, as if the fame were re-

peated and re-enacted in this Adh

LX. 4 And whereas, in pursuance of sundry Acts of Parliament of the fourth and fifth Years of the Reign

4 of King William and Queen Mary, and of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and thirtieth Years of tbd Reign of

4 his late Majesty King George ‘the Second, and several other and subsequent Acts of Parliament, certain

4 Sums of Money are reservea and set apart, at the Receipt of the Exchequer, for the Payment of Annuities

4 on Lives payable there : And whereas it appears that the Sum of thirty-four thousand eight hundred and

4 ninety-two Pounds and seven Pence, was remaining on the fifth Day of January one thousand (even

4 hundred and eighty-seven, in the said Receipt of Exchequer, undemanded and unclaimed, but no Certifi-

4 cates of the Deaths of the respective Persons for whom the fame had been reserved, have been returned into

4 the Exchequer, notifying the Deaths of the Nominees, according to the Directions contained in the several

4 Acts of Parliament for granting such Annuities on Lives: And whereas, from the Length of Time the

4 said Annuities have remained unclaimed, there is great Reason to conclude that the Nominees for whole

4 Lives the fame were granted, or the greater Part ol them, are deadBe it therefore enacted by the Autho-

rity aforesaid, That all such Sum and Sums of Money as shall or may remain in the said Receipt of the Ex-

chequer, on the fifth Day of January one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, which hath or have been

jeferved for the Payment of any Annuity or Annuities for Life or Lives, granted as aforesaid, which hath or

and after the fifth Day of January one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, any and every Annuity*

payable at the Receipt of the Exchequer for Terms of Lives, which Annuity shall not have been claimed or

demanded for the Space of three Years, shall be deemed and taken to have expired, and the Money due or to*

become due in respect of the fame shall be paid over to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, to

4 Plantations, Islands, and Territories, in AJw, Africa, and America, to his Majesty belonging, is now by

4 Law confined to such Ships only as are of the Built of Great Britain and Ireland, thelfiands of Guernsey,

4 Jersey, and Man, and of the said Colonies, Plantations, Islands, and Territories: And whereas Ships

4 wholly owr ed by British Subjects, and navigated according to Lav/, can be legally used and employed

4 only in the European 1 rade of this Kingdom, and the fame are, by virtue of this Act, allowed to be con-

4 tinued in the said Trade until the fame shall be worn out; and it is therefore necessary to distinguish

enacted by the Authority aforesaid. That the Certificates which shall hereafter be granted in pursuance of this

4 virtue of which such Ships and Vessels are at present used and employed, contrary to the Laws now in

4 force, in the Trade to and from his Majesty’s Colonies, Plantations, Islands, or Territories, in Asia,

4 Africa, and America; and it is therefore expedient and necefliry, for detecting the Frauds at pfelent

4 committed, and for preventing the fame in future, that all Pvegiflers hetetofore granted should be called in,

4 and delivered up to the proper Officer to be cancelled, and that new Regilters, of the Form herein be-

4 fore described, should be granted in lieu thereof, in the Manner herein before directed, to all such Ships

4 or Vessels as shall appear to be legally intitled to the fame: And whereas it is expedient tofpecify and

4 quired to be registered, should hereafter be registered, according to the Intent and Meaning of this Act,

4 and should receive Certificates according to the Form and in the Manner herein before directed Be it

III. And whereas the Punishment of Burning in the Hand, when any Pjerfon is convicted of Felony

4 within the Benefit of Clergy, is often disregarded, and ineffectual; and sometimes may fix a lading Mark

4 of Disgrace and Infamy on Offenders, who might otherwise become good Subjects, and profitable Mem-

4 bers of the Commonwealth be it therefore enacted, That, from and after the passing of this Act,

^when any Person shall, in any of the Courts before mentioned, be lawfully convicted of any Felony within

the Benefit of Clergy, for which he or she is liable by Law to be burned or marked in the Brawn of the

V. And whereas, if many Offenders, convicted of Crimes for which Transportation hath been usually His Majesty im-

4 infiided, were ordered to solitary Imprisonment, ►accompanied by well-regulated Labour, and religious powered to ap-

Instruction, it might be the Means, under Providence, not only of deterring others from the Commission pointthreeSuper-

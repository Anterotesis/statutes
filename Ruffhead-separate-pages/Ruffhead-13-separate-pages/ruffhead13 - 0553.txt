by and sold at the Sales of the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies> shall,

from and after the passing of this Act, be, and the fame is hereby repealed and made void.

4 IV. And whereas Goods of the Growth, Product, or Manufacture of the East Indies taken as Prize,

4 have been, and may, during the present Hostilicies with France or Spain, be carried into some of the Out-

4 ports of th’S Kingdom and condemned ; and from the Inexperience of the Officers of the Customs at such

c Ports, Difficulties have arisen in computing and charging the Duties thereon :* For Remedy whereof, be

it further enacted, by the Authority aforesaid. That in ail Cafes where such Goods shall be carried into

any Out-port in this Kingdom, and condemned as Prize, Bond, with sufficient Security, shall be given

to his Mdj.efty, in Treble the Value of such Goods, that the fame shall be brought to London, and de-

livered to his Majesty’s Warehouse-keeper, at the Custom-house for the Port of London, to be deposited by

him in Warehouses provided at the Expence of the Captors or their Agents, and approved of by the Com-

missioners of the Customs, or any four or more of them ; and with further Condition to produce a Certi-

ficate from such Warehouse-keeper, within three Months from the Date of such Bond, that the Goods

have been delivered accordingly; which Security the Collector and Comptroller, or other principal Of-

ficer of the Customs, at the Port from whence such Goods are to be removed, are hereby authorised and

impowered to take, and tocancj! and discharge such Bond upon receiving the Certificate from the Ware-

house keeper, as herein-before directed ; and if such Goods shall be sent by Land Carriage, they shall be

removed under the Seals of Office of such Collector and Comptroller, or principal Officer of the Customs,

and shall be accompanied with a Transtre expressing the Number and Marks of the Packages; and all such

Goods so removed, either by Land or Water, shall afterwards be publicly expoied to Sale in the City of

London, determined by the Captors or their Agents, they giving Notice of such Sale to the proper Officers of the Cuf-

toms and Excise appointed or to be appointed for that Purpose ; and the Duties due and payable for such

Goods shall be thereupon computed and charged by the proper Officers of the Customs or Excise respect-

ively concerned therein, by the facyie Rules, Regulations, and Restrictions, in all Respects (excepting

any Allowance for Warehouse Rent) as the Duties payable upon the like Goods imported by, and sold at

the Sales of, the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indiej, are computed and

charged ; and the Duties due by Law thereon shall be accordingly paid and applied; any Custom or Usage

to the contrary notwithstanding.

4 V. And whereas, by the nerein-before recited Act, made in the eighteenth Year of his Majesty's

4 Reign, it is, amongst other Things, enacted. That any Prize Goods received into any Warehouses in

4 this Kingdom, in pursuance of that Act, ftjay be exported directly from thence without paying any fur-

4 ther Duty than is by the said Act directed, upon the Security therein mentioned : And whereas, in some

4 Cafes, it is impracticable for the Captors or their Agents to procure Ships to export such Goods directly

4 from the Ports where thdy are so warehoused, and the keeping such Goods therein for a considerable Tim*,

4 in order to procure such VefteJs, is attended with great Expence and Loss to the CaptorsFor Remedy

whereof, be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid. That it shall and may be lawful for the Com-

missioners of his Majesty’s Customs, or any three or more of them, in any Cafe where they shall think

proper, to order such Goods, so secured in any Warehouse in this Kingdom, to be removed and sent from

thence for Exportation to, any Custom-house Warehouse, at any other Port or Place in Great Britain, by

and under the Seal of Office of the Collector and Comptroller of the Customs at the Port from whence

the Goods are intended to be: so removed, at the Expence of the Captors or their Agents, or other Person

or Persons toho may have pijrchafed the fame; and in such Cafe, the Security directed by the herein-before

recited Act, (hill be taken by the Customer or Collector of the Port to which such Goods are removed,

before they are delivered for Exportation, instead of the Customer or Collector of the Port where they

*were first warehoused as aforesaid ; any Thing in the said recited Act to the contrary notwithstanding.

4 VI. And whereas the Duties payable by Law upon Prize Tobacco, of the Growth, Product, or

4 Manufacture of any foreign Colony or Plantation, are so high as to render it impracticable for the Captors

4 or their Agents to dispose of the fame, after Condemnation, fn this Kingdom to any Advantage:* For

Remedy thereof, be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, Thar all Tobacco, not being the Growth,

Product, of Manufactuie of any British .American Colony or Plantation, or any Place or Country tinder

the Dominion of his Majesty, sX/hich hath been taken and condemned as Prize, and which is now Remain-

to pay the fame Duties as Tobacco of the Growth, Product, or Manufacture of the British Colonies or

Plantations ,in America, are or may be liable to by Law, and to no o her; and upon Exportation of such

Tob icco into fore gn Parts, the Whole of such Duties so paid 01 secured shall be repaid and drawn back,

or the Sccuiity vacated, excepting the Half of the old Subsidy, granted by an Act: passed in the twelfth

Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second, and the Wnole or rhe further Sibfidv of Poundage, granted

by an Act passed in the twenty-first Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, being

4 XX. And whereas the said Act, of the twenty-second Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King

George the Second, only gives an Appeal from an Order of any Justice or Justices of the Peace to the

General or General Quarter Sessions of the Peace, where an Order is made by any Tuftice or Justices of

the Peace, in the Cale of the Buyer or Receiver of such purloined or embezzled Materials as aforesaid,

and in respect to the Sale or Disposal of such Materials found on searching by Warrant, after any Con-

viction for purloining or embezzling, or for receiving or buying such purloined or embezzled Ma erials:

And whereas it is thought more proper to give a Right of appealing in the Cafe of o her Orders of any

Justice or Justices of the Peace, to be made by Force of an Act, made in the twelfth Year of the Reign

c of his late Majesty King George the First* (intituled, An Act to prevent unlawful Combinations of Workmen

4 employed in the Woollen Manufactures, and for better Payment of their WagesJ, and of the said Act, and

4 also in the Cafe of all Orders to be made by any Justices of the Peace under this Act;’ be it therefore

further enacted, That if any Person shall think himself or herself aggrieved by the Order or Judgment of

any two Justices before whom he or she shall have been convidied of any of the Offences in the said Acts

of the twelfth Year of the Reign of King George the First, and the twenty-second Year of the Reign of

King George the Second, or in this Act, such Person may appeal, and the fa d Justices are hereby required

to make known to such Person, at the Time of such Conv dtion, his or her Right to appeal, to the next

General or General Quarter Sessions of the Peace to be holden for the County, Riding, Division, City,

Liberty, Town, or Place, where such Convidiion shall have been made (such Person, at the Time of

such Convidiion, giving to such Justices Notice in Writing of his or her Jnienrion to appeal, and also en-

tering into a Recognizance, at the Time of such Notice, with sufficient Sureties, conditioned to try such

Appeal, and to abide the Judgment of, and pay such Costs as shall be awarded by, the Justices at such

Sessions); but if the Person giving such Notice of Appeal shall not, at the Time of* giving such Notice,

enter into such Recognizance as aforesaid, then the Justices, to whom such Notice of Appeal shall have

been given, shall and may commit such Person or Persons to the House of Correction, or other public

Prison, of such County, Riding, Division, City, Liberty, Town, or Place, there to remain until the

said next General or General Quarter Sessions of the Peace to be holden in and for such Place, unless such

Recognizance shall be sooner entered into; and the said Justices before wh >in such Conviction shall have

been made or any other two or more Justices of the lame County, Riding, Division, City, Liberty,

Town, or Place, are hereby impowered and required to take, and the Justices at such Sessions are hereby

authorised and required, upon due Proof made of such Notice of Appeal, either by the Acknowledgment

of the Justices to whom the fame shall have been given, or otherwise, to hear and determine the Matter

of the said Appeal, and to award such Costs as to them shall appear just and reasonable, to b* paid by

cither Party: And if, upon the Hearing of fu^h Appeal, the Judgment of the Justices before whom the

Appellant shall have been convicted shall be affirmed, such Appellant shall, within forty-eight Hours next

after the fame shall be so affirmed, suffer such corporal Punishment as shall have been directed to he in-

flicted upon him or her for the Offence whereof he or she shall have been convidTd, or shall immediately

pay the Sum whi.h he or she shall have been adjudged to lorfeit, together with such Costs as the Justices

in the said sessions shall award to he paid by him or her, for defraying the Expences fufLined by the De-

fendant or D'ffndants in such Appeal; or, in Default of making such Payment, shall be corn nit'ed to

from the Affirmance of such Convidfion, as shall be directed by the original Judgment of C nviction,

unless the Person or Per Ions so convicted (hill have been imprisoned under the original Con' iction, in

which (J«»fe the Time lor which such Person or Persons shall have been so confined shall be inJuded in the

Ord « r of Confirmation.

4 VV the Second, intituled, An Act for regulating the quartering of Soldiers during the Time of. the Elec-

4 tions of Members to serve in Parliament; it is recited. That by the ancient Common Law. of this.Land

4 all Elections ought to be free; and that by an Act passed in the third Year of Edward the First it is com-

4 manded, that no Man, by Force of Arms, or Malice or Menacing, shall disturb any to make free Elec-

4 tion : And that forasmuch as the Freedom of Elections of Members to serve in Parliament, is of the

4 utmost Consequence to the Preservation of the Rights and Liberties of this Kingdom, and that it has

4 been the Usage and Practice to cause any Regiment, Troop, or Company, or any Number of Soldiers,

4 which hath been quartered in any City, Borough, Town, or Place, where any Election of Members

* to* serve in Parliament hath been appointed to be made, to remove and continue out of the fame during

4 the Time of such Election (except in such particular Cafes as therein after specified); it is therefore

4 enacted, That when and as often as any Election of any Member or Members to serve in Parliament

4 shall be appointed to be made, the Secretary at War, or the Person who shall officiate in the Place of

4 the Secretary at War, shall, at some convenient Time before the Day appointed for such Election, issue

4 and fend forth proper Orders for the Removal of all Soldiers who shall be quartered or biiletted in any

4 City, Borough, Town, or Place, where such Election shall be appointed to be made, out of every such

4 City, Borough, Town or Place, one Day at lead before the Day appointed for such Election, to the

4 Distance of two or mote Miles from such City, Borough, Town, or Place, and not to make any nearer

4 Approach thereto, until one Day at the least after the Poll to be taken at such Election shall be ended,

4 and the Poll Books closed, under certain Penalties and Disabilities in the said Act mentioned: And

4 whereas, by a Provision in the said Act, it is declared. That nothing therein contained shall extend, or

4 be construed to extend, to the City and Liberty of Westminster, or the Borough of Southwark, for and

4 in Respect of the Guards of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, nor to any City, Borough, Town, or

4 Place, where his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, or any of the Royal Family, shall happen to be or

4 reside at the Time of any such Election as aforesaid, for or in respect of such Number of Troops or

4 Soldiers only as shall be attendant as Guards to his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, or to such other

4 Person of the Royal Family as is aforesaid, nor to any Castle, Fort, or fortified Place, where any G*f-

4 rifon is usually kept, for or in respect of such Number of Troops or Soldiers only whereof such Garrison

4 is composed: And whereas in the City of Winchester there is a House or Palace belonging to his Majesty,

4 which it has been found necessary to use as a Prison for confining and guarding a large Number of French

4 and Spanish Prisoners, and that a Number of Troops have, for some Time past, been stationed in the

4 said City for the Purpose of guarding such Prisoners : And whereas the Number of such Prisoners are so

4 great, that they could not be removed during any Election of Members to serve in Parliament for the

4 laid City, without great Difficulty, Expence, and Hazard of Escape : And whereas the Removal of the f

4 said Troops, necessary for the Guard of such Prisoners, would be attended with manifest Danger, not'

4 only to the Inhabitants of the said City, and Persons resorting thereto, but to the Public in general:

4 Therefore, in order to the better guarding and safe keeping of such Prisoners during the Time of any

4 such Election be it enacted by the King’s rood Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Con-

sent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the

Authority of the same. That nothing in the said Act contained shall extend, or be construed to extend,

to the said City, for such Time only as it shall be found necessary to detain such Prisoners of War in the

said House or Palace, and so far as the fame relates to such Troops or Soldiers only as are necessary. for the

Purpose of guarding any such Prisoners of War ; provided that the Number of such Troops shall not, during

the Times of such Election, exceed the Proportion of three Soldiers to every twenty Prisoners so confined ;

and provided that such Proportion of the said Troops as are not actually upon Guard, shall, during such

Eleftioiu remain in the Barracks until it is necessary to relieve the said Guard, after which Time the

former Guard shall immediately return to the said Barracks, and so alternately during the Continuance of

such Election.

4 II. And whereas the said City of Winchester is the usual Place for holding Elections for the County of

4 Southampton: And whereas by -an Act, made in the seventh and eighth Years of King IVilliamXhe Third,

* for the further regulating Elections of Members to serve in Parliament, and for the preventing irregular Pro-

4 aedings of Sheriffs, and other Officers> in electing and returning such Members^ it is enacted* That upon

4 every Election of any Knight of the Shire, the Sheriff shall hold his County Court at the most public

4 and usual Place of Election, and where the fame has been usually held for forty Years: And whereas

4 the said City of Winchester is the Place at which the said County Court has been usually held : Where-

4 fore, for preventing the Inconveniences which may happen from an Election of a Knight of the Shire

4# for the said County of Southampton being held at the said City of Winchesterbe it enacted by the Autho-

rity aforesaid, That any Election for a Knight of the Shire for the said County of Southampton, which shall

XXIX. And whereas a great Number of Commission and Warrant Officers, in his Majesty’s Sea and

4 Land Service, who, through unavoidable Misfortunes, have involved themselves in Debt, are now un-

able, though willing, to serve their King and Country, because, to avoid the Dtfgrace and Shame of a

4 Prison, they have taken Shelter in privileged Places, and cannot come forth without Danger of being

4 immediately arrested, or have been thrown into Prison, without Hopes of being released by any Discharge

4 of their Debts, and are therefore become useless and a heavy Burthen, instead of being serviceable to the

4 State: And whereas many of them are not under the Description of those Persons who can take Benefit by

the Provisions of this A&, without some Extension thereof, yet are very proper ObjeCis of such Relief as

4 is hereby intended to be given be it therefore enacted, That all and every Commission or Warrant Of-

ficer or Officers, in his Majesty’s Sea or Land Service, now upon the full or half-pay Lift, who shall, on

or before the twenty-sixth Day of June, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight, surrender himself

or themselves to the Gaoler or Keeper of any of his Majesty’s Prisons, in such Manner as is herein directed

shall, subsequent thereto, conform themselves in all RefpeCIs to the like Terms and Conditions prescribed

to such Fugitive Debtors (except as to so much of the Oath required to be taken by them, as declares that

such Debtors were in foreign Parts on a certain Day, and did surrender within fourteen Days after their

Return); instead whereof, every such Debtor shall swear, that he did, on or before the twenty-sixth Day

©(June, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight [as the Cafe may be\, surrender himself to the Custody

of the Gaoler or Keeper of [infer* the Name of the Prison'], and who shall, in all

other RefpeCls, take the fame Oath as every such Fugitive Debtor is required toco, shall be deemed and

taken to be a Prisoner or Prisoners within the true Meaning of this Act, and be intitled to the Benefits

thereof, to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever.

4 XXX. And whereas divers Persons are under a Necessity of residing Abroad, to avoid being thrown

4 into Gaol on account of Annuities by them granted as a Means of raising Money either to themselves, or

4 others for whom they have become Surety, and such Persons cannot have the Benefit of a Discharge by

4 virtue of this Act, in respect of the accruing Payments of such Annuities subsequent to the twenty-eighth

ment, or other Assurance, made, entered into, or obtained, for securing the Payment of any such An-

nuitv.

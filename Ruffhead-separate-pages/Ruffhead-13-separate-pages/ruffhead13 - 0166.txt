4 at such fmail Rents w aforesaid by the Matter of the Rolls for the Time being, the succeeding Matter

4 or Matters of the Rolls is or are deprived of the Benefit of the improved Rents of the Premises, which,

4 after the Death of the Matter of the Rolls by whom such Leases were granted, accrue and belong to his

4 Family, and the Income intended for the Support of the Office of the Mailer of the Rolls is rendered in

4 a great Meafuie precarious and uncertain : And whereas Sir Thomas Sewell^ the present Matter of the

4 Rolls, is now possessed or intitlcrd to himself, his Executors, Admimttrators, and Alligns, of or to the

4 beneficial Right and Interest of and in several Leases by him made and granted of the said Houses and

4 Premises, by virtue of and according to the Power veiled in him by the said A3 of the twelfth Year of

4 King Charles the Second, and the improved Rents thereof for the Term of twenty-one Years from the

4 making of such Leases, on the sixth Day of January, one thousand seven hundred and fevemy seven;

4 and aHo of and in such other Leases of the said Houses and Premises, or any Part thereof, as he may ac

4 any Tune or Times hereafter, so long as he shall continue Mailer of the Rolls, make or grant thereof,

4 according to the said Power, subje£l to the Right and Interest of the Right Honourable Thomas Earl of

4 Macclesfield therein, who, as Residuary Legatee of Sir Thomas Clarke deceased, late Mailer of the Rolls,

4 is intfiled, under Leases granted of the said Houses and Premises respectively by the said late Mailer of

4 the Rolls, to the improved Rents of some of the said Houses and Premises, amounting together to the

4 yearly Sum of one thousand four hundred and fifty-six Pounds, Part of the said yearly Sum of one thou-

4 sand nine hundred and seventy-seven Pounds, down to the filth Day of January, which will be in the

4 Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, subjetSl to and after a Deduction and

4 Payment of the fmail Rents reserved on the Leases of those Houses respectively, amounting together to

4 the yearly Sum of ninety Pounds, Part of the said yearly Sum of one hundred and thirty-nve rounds 5

4 and is also intitled to the improved Rents of some other of the said Houses and Premises, amounting to-

4 gether to the yearly Sum of four hundred and seventy-six Pounds, other Part of the said yearly Sum of

4 one thousand nine hundred and seventy-seven Pounds, down to the twentieth Day of September, which

4 will be in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-five, subje3 to and after a De-

4 dudion and Payment of the fmail Rents reserved on the Leases of those Houses respectively, amounting

together to the yearly Sum of forty-two Pounds, other Part of the said yearly Sum of one hundred and

thirty-five Pounds; but as to one other of the said Houses, the fmail Rent whereof is the yearly Sum of

three Pounds, Residue of the said yearly Sum of one hundred and thirty-five Pounds, and the improved

Rent whereof is the yearly Sum of forty-five Pounds, Residue of the said yearly Sum of one thousand

nine hundred and seventy-seven Pounds, subject to a Deduction and Payment of the said fmail yearly

Rent of three Pounds, the said Earl of Macclesfield has already parted with, and fold his Right and In-

terest therein, in order that that House might be (as it has ever lince been, and now is) maoe use of by

the Clerk of the Rolls Chapel, during the Time the said Earl of Macclesfield's Right and Interest therein

would have continued; (rhat is to say) down to the said fifth Day of January, one thousand seven hun-

dred and eighty-three, for the Purpose of copying therein the Records deposited in the said Rolls Chapel:

And whereas it is inconvenient, and highly improper, that the Mailer of the Rolls for the Time being

4 should not, at the Time he holds and exercises the said Office, receive and enjoy so considerable a Part

4 of the Income of the said Office, towards the Support of the Rank and Dignity thereof; and it has

4 therefore been proposed to give to the said Earl of Macclesfield, and to the said Sir Tl>omas Sewell respec-

4 tively, an Equivalent for such their several and respective beneficial Rights and Interests as aforesaid,

4 undrr the said several Leases granted by the said Mailer of the Rolls now subsisting, and that the said

4 Matter of the Rolls shall relinquish and give up all Right and Power of granting any more such Leases

4 for the future, by virtue of and under the said A3 of the twelfth Year of King Charles the Second, in

4 order that the Leases of the said Houses and Premises, and the Right and Power of granting the fame

4 for the future, may be properly regulated, so that the improved Rents of the said Houses and Premises

4 may for the future, as they shall become due, be received and enjoyed by the present and successive

4 Matters of the Rolls for the Time being, subje3 nevertheless to the Provisions hereby made thereout,

4 for the Repairs, Maintenance; and Support of the (aijd Houses and Premises (except as aforesaid), and

4 for other the Purposes herein-after mentioned ; and the said Earl of Macclesfield and the said Sir Thomas

4 Sewell, respectively, are ready and willing to accept of an Equivalent for such their several and respec-

4 tive beneficial Rights and Irtterefts as aforesaid ; and the said Sir Thomas Sevjell also to relinquish and

4 give up all Right and Power of granting any Leases of the said Houses and Premises for the future, under

4 and according to the said A3 of the twelfth Year of King Charles the Second : And whereas such the

4 beneficial Right and Interest of the said Earl of Macclesfield, in the said Houses and Piemifes, appears,

4 on and according to a fair and just Estimate and Valuation thereof, to be of the Value of eight thousand

4 four hundred forty-nine Pounds seven Shillings and Nine-pence Halfpenny, from the fifth Day of

4 one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven ; and such the beneficial Right and Interest of the

4 said Sir Thomas Sewell, in the said Houses and Premises as aforesaid, under the said several Leases granted

4 by him and now fubfitting, and his present Right and Power of granting such Leases down to and until

4 the said fifth Day of July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, exclusive of any Right and

4 Power of granting any future Leases, under and according to the said A3 of the twelfth Year of King

4 Charles the Second, subsequent to, or to take Effect from and after the said fifth Day of July, one thou-

4 sand (even hundred and seventy-seven, which Right and Power of granting such future Leales he relin-

4 quilhes and gives up, appears, on a fair and just Estimate and Valuation thereof, to be of the Value of

4 twelve thousand five hundred and eighty Pounds three Shillings and one Penny; the said two Sums

4 of eight thousand four hundred forty-nine Pounds seven Shillings and Nine pence Halfpenny, and

4 twelve thousand five hundred and eighty Pounds three Shillings and one Penny, amounting together

4 to the Sum of twenty-one thousand and twenty-nine Pounds ten Shillings and Ten-pence Halfpenny:

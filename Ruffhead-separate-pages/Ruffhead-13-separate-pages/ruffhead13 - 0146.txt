more speedy and effectual building, rebuilding, repairing, or purchasing Houses, and

other necessary Buildings and Tenements, for the Use of their Benefices.

c WHEREAS many of the Parochial Clergy, for want of proper Habitations, are induced to re-

4 YV fide at a Distance from their Benefices, by which Means the Parishioners lose the Advantage of

4 their Instruction and Hospitality, which were great Objects in the original Distribution of Tythes and’

4 Glebes for the Endowment of ChurchesFor Remedy whereof, may it please your Majesty that it

may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and

“decayed, or is so mean, that one Year’s net Income and Produce of such Living will not be sufficient to

build, rebuild, or put the fame, with the necessary Offices belonging thereto, in sufficient Repair, shall

think fit to apply for the Aid and Assistance intended to be given by this Act, it shall and may be lawful

for every such Parson, Vicar, or Incumbent (after having procured, from some skilful and experienced

before the Ordinary and Patron of the Living, and obtained their Consent to such proposed new Build-

ings or Repairs, by Writing under their respective Hands, in the Form for that Purpose contained in the

Schedule hereunto annexed), to borrow and take up at Interest, in the Manner hereafter mentioned, such

Sum or Sums of Money as the said Estimate shall amount unto, after deducting the Value of Timber or

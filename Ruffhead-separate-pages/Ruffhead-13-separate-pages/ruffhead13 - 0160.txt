4 Witness or Witnesses* before one or more Justice or Justices of the Peace of the County, Riding, Divi-

4 fion. City, Liberty, Town, or Place, where the Offence or Offences should be committed, should be

4 sent to the House of Correction, there to be kept to hard Labour for any Time not exceeding one Month:

4 And whereas the said Provision contained in the said recited Clause is not found sufficient for the Purpose

4 intended, and it is apprehended that some other Provision, more proper, may be madebe it therefore

further enacted, That, from and after the said first Day of July9 one thousand seven hundred and seventy-

seven, the whole of the said last-recited Clause shall be repealed; and that, from and after the said first Day

of July^ one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, if any Person, being hired, retained, or employed,

to prepare or work up any Materials, whether mixed or unmixed, for any Master or Masters, shall wilfully

neglect or refuse the Performance thereof for eight Days successively; or having taken in any Materials,

whether mixed or unmixed, for Manufacture, from one Master, or two or more Masters being Co-

partners, shall afterwards take in any Materials, whether mixed or unmixed, for Manufacture, from aqy

other Master or Masters; or shall procure, or permit himself or herself to be employed or retained in any

other Occupation or Employment whatsoever, sooner than eight Days before the Completion of the Work

first taken j then, in every such Cafe, such Person being thereof lawfully conviCied by the Oath, or (being

of the People called Quakers) Affirmation, of one or more credible Witness or Witnesses, before two or

more Justices of the Peace of the County, Riding, Division, City, Liberty, Town, or Place, where the

Offence or Offences shall be committed, shall be sent to the House of Correction, or other public Prison,

there to be kept to hard Labour for any Time not exceeding three Months, nor less than one Month.

4 IX* And whereas it frequently happens that Persons receive the said Materials in fi&iuous Names, in

4 order to be manufactured; and that persons receive such Materials in their own Names, in order to be

4 manufactured by themselves, and afterwards deliver the fame toothers to be manufactured, without the

4 Knowledge or Consent of the Owners thereof; and that Carriers, or other Persons employed to deliver

4 Materials to Workmen to be prepared or manufactured, do designedly deliver such Materials to other

4 Persons than those intended by the Owner of such Materials ;â€™ be it therefore further enacted by the Au-

thority aforesaid, That, from and after the said first Day of July* one thousand seven hundred and seventy-

seven, if any Person shall receive any of the aforesaid Materials in a fictitious Name, in order to be manu-

factured; or if any Person shall receive in his or her own Name any of the said Materials, in order to be

manufactured by himself or herself, and afterwards deliver the fame, or any Part thereof, to any other

Person to be manufactured (without the Consent of the Owner thereof); or if any Carrier, or other Person

employed to deliver any such Materials to any Workman, to be prepared or wrought up, shall designedly

deliver the fame to any other Person than the Person to whom such Materials were ordered or intended to

be delivered by the Owner thereof; all and every Person and Persons offending in any of the Cafes afore-

said, shall, for every such Offence, be liable to Prosecution, in the same Manner, and to the fame Punish-

ment, as is by this Act directed in respect to Persons taking in any of the said Materials in order to work

up, and afterwards wilfully neglecting or refusing the Performance of their Work for the Space of Time

aforesaid.

4 X. And whereas it frequently happens that Materials used in the Manufactures before mentioned, are

4 found, or known to be concealed in the Possession of Persons who have received the fame, knowing them

to be purloined or embezzled, or of Persons known not to be entitled to dispose of the fame; and whereas

the Discovery and Conviction of the Purloiners and Embezzlers, Buyers and Receivers, of such Mate-

4 rials, is full of Difficulty, from the close and clandestine Manner in which the Offence is committed;

and there is (till greater Difficulty in proving whose Pioperty such Materials are; and it would tend to the

4 Discouragement and Suppression of such Offences, if the Discovery and ConviCtion of such Offenders

4 were rendered more easy: And whereas, by the said recited Act of the twenty-second Year of his late

Majesty King George the Second, Justices of the Peace, after ConviCtion of any Offender for purloining

4 or embezzling the said Materials, or for buying or receiving the fame, are authorited to grant Warrants

4 for searching the Houses and other Places of the Persons To conviCted, but no such Authority is given

before ConviCtion, nor in any other House or Place, except such as belongs to a Person conviCted be

it therefore further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for any two Justices of the Peace of any

County, Riding, Divifioli, City, Liberty, Town, or Place, upon Complaint made to them, upon Oath,

by any one credible Person, or (being of the People called Quakers) upon solemn Affirmation, that there is

Cause to suspect that any such purloined or embezzled Materials, whether mixed or unmixed, wrought or

unwrought, are concealed in any Dwelling-house, Out-house, Yard, Garden, or other Place or Places,

by virtue of a Warrant under their Hands and Seals, to cause every such Dwelling-house, Out-house,

Yard, Garden, or Place, to be searched in the Day-time: And if any such Materials, suspeCfed to be pur-

loined or embezzled, shall be found therein, to cause the fame, and the Person or Persons in whose House,

Out-house, Yard, Garden, or other Place, the fame shall be found, to be brought before any two Justices

of the Peace for the same County, Riding, Division, City, Liberty, Town, or Place; and if the said

Person or Persons shall not give an Account, to the Satisfaction of such Justices, how he, she, or they

came by the fame, then the said Person or Persons so offending, shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of a

Misdemeanor, and shall be punished in Manner herein-afeer mentioned, although no Proof shall be given

to whom such Materials belong.

XI. And be it further enacted, That every Peace-officer, Constable, Headborough, or Tythingman,

in every County, City, Town Corporate, or other Place, where there shall be Officers, and every Beadle

wiihin his Ward, Parish, or District, and every Watchman, during such Time only as he is on his Duty,

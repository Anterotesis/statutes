* the said several TurifdiClions where the Debt or Damages have been under forty Shillings: And whereat

4 very extensive Trades and Manufactures are carried on by Persons residing or dealing within the Parishes

4 of Halifax, Bradford, Kigbley, Bingiey, Guijdcy, Calverley, Ealleyx Birjlal, Mirfield, Hartijhead cum

4 Clifton, Almondbury, Kir kh eat on, Kirkburton, and Huddersfield, and the Lord ship or Liberty of in

4 the Weft Riding of the County of York, many of whom frequently contrail Debts under forty Shillings,

4 and also Debts of forty Shillings and upwards, to the Amount of five Pounds, making in the whole a

4 large Sum of Money yearly: And whereas several of the Parishes before mentioned, and also the said

4 Lordship or Liberty of Tong, and some Parts of others of the said Parishes, are situate within the said

4 Honour of Pontefiafiand others of such Parishes, or some Part or Parts thereof, are situate within

4 the said Manors of Wakefield and Bingiey respectively, and within the Jurisdiction of the said Honour

4 and Manors respeClively : And whereas, notwithstanding Justice hath been from Time to Time admi-

4 nidered in the said several Courts Baron, in the mod impartial Manner; yet the Method of compelling

4 Debtors to appear to Actions commenced in the said Courts Baron, and of bringing such Actions to llfue

4 and Trial, and the Method of compelling Persons to attend as Jurymen on such Trials, are very dila-

4 tory, and oftep ineffectual for those respective Purposes; and by reason whereof, and of the Expence

4 attending the Prosecution of causes to Judgment in the said Courts Baron, many honest Creditors are

4 often discouraged from attempting to recover just Debts, and thereby many evil-disposed Persons, who*

4 bave contracted small Debts within the said Parishes, Lord ship and Liberty, often refuse Payment

4 thereof, and set their Creditors at Defiance: And whereas the erecting a Court of Requests, for the

4 Recovery of small Debts under forty Shillings, in a summary Way, within the said Parishes, Lordship

4 and Liberty, and the regulating the Practice and Proceedings of the said Courts Baron, and extending

4 the Jurisdiction thereof to hold Pleas for Debts and Damages within their respeCUve Liberties, not ex-

4 ceeding five Pounds, would much contribute to promote Industry, support and encourage useful Credit*

4 and be a great Advantage to the Inhabitants and others living or trading within the Distrids or Places

4 aforesaid : May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enabled ; and be it enacted by the KingV

roost Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and

and Tumults, and for putting an End to the said Outrages, and for restoring and preserving the public

4 -Peace, and on the Occasions, and for the Purposes aforesaid, have done divers Acts which cannot be

4 justified by theftiidt Forms of Law, and yet were necessary, and so much for the Preservation of the

4 Lives and Properties of his Majesty's Subjects, and the public Safety and Peace, that they ought to be

4 justified by Act of Parliament, and the Persons by whom they were transa&ed ought to be indemnified

be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent

of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the

Authority of the same, That all Personal Actions and Suits, Indictments and Informations, which have

been, or shall be, commenced or prosecuted, and all Molestations, Prosecutions, and Proceedings what-

soever, and Judgments thereupon (if any be), against the said Magistrates, or other Persons, for or by~

reason of any Ad, Matter, or Thing, commanded or done on the Occasions, and for the Purposes afore-

said, or anyvof them, before the twenty-fourth Day of June, one thousand seven hundred and eighty, shall

be discharged and made void; and every Person, by whom any such Ad, Matter, or Thing, which shall

have been commanded or done, before the said twenty-fourth Day of June, one thousand seven hundred

and eighty, shall be freed, acquitted, and indemnified, a9 well against the King’s Majesty, his Heirs and

Successors, as against all and every other Person and Persons; and if any Action or Suit hereby discharged,

or intended to be discharged, is or shall be commenced or prosecuted, every Person so sued may plead the

General Blue, and give this Act, and the Special Matter, in Evidence; and if the Plaintiff or Plaintiffs

shall become nonsuit, or forbear further Prosecution, or suffer Discontinuance, or if a Verdict pass against

such Plaintiff or Tlaintiffs, the Defendant or Defendants shall recover his, her, or their Double Costs,

for which he, she, or they shall have the like Remedy, as in Cafes when Colts, by Law are given to

Defendants.

CAP. XVII.

An Act for building an additional Jail, and also a Prison and House of Corredion, withirv

the County of Cornwall; and for other Purposes therein mentioned.

* XT 7” HEREAS the common Jail of the County of Cornwall for Criminals is within the Castle Preix&M*

* VV of LatmceHen in the f*d County, which is at present in a very decayed Condition, and being

* situated near the Eastern Extremity of the County, the Ease and Convenience of the Inhabitants would

4 be best Aiited by an additional Jail for Criminals being provided nearer the Centre of the said County j

* and the Borough of Bodmin in the said County, being, from its Situation, and the Advantages of healthy

4 Air, a good Soil, and Plenty of pure and whedefome Water, esteemed the properest Place for the Erec-

4 tion of such additional or new Jail; the Mayor and Burgesses of the said Borough have, in order to for*

* ward the Design of ereCting the fame, agreed to give up a Piece or Parcel of Ground lying within the

4 said Borough, oeing Part of the Pefieifions of the Corporation, and commonly called or known by the

f Name of Berryeoombe, otherwise Bur com, as and for the Site of the said intended Jail, being very con-

4 venient and proper to be used for that Purpose, without receiving any pecuniary or other Consideration

* for the fame: And whereas the said Jail within the Castle of Launceflon aforesaid ha9 been hitherto kept

* in Repair by and out of the Revenues of the Duke of Cornwall for the Time being, and his Majesty,

4 being disposed to promote the Convenience and Security of his Subjects in the said County, hath been

4 roeft graeiously pleafa) to order certain Sum of Money to be advanced and paid out of the aforesaid

4 Revenues, to be applied as well for putting the said last-mentiened Jail into immediate Repair, as to*

4 wards erecting the said intended new Jail: upon Condition, that the Duke of Cornwall for the Time

4 being may be for ever freed and discharged, not only from all Contributions to the future Repairs of the

4 said Jail within the Castle of Launceston aforesaid, but also from all Charges and Expences which may

4 attend the ereCting and finishing of the said intended new Jail, or the future Repairs thereof; which

4 said Sum has been accordingly paid to and accepted by his Majesty’s Justices of the Peace of and for the

4 said County, in their General or Quarter Sessions assembled, upon the Conditions aforesaid: And

4 whereas, besides the said present and intended Tails for Criminals, a Ward or Prison for the secure

4 keeping of Debtors, and also a House of Correction for certain Offenders, are greatly wanted in the

4 said County, there being at present no public Building for either of those Purposes; and, as the fame

may be most conveniently united to the said intended Jail for Criminals, it has been proposed, that the

4 intended Buildingwithin the Borough of Bodmin aforesaid {hall consist as well of a Jail for Criminals,

4 as Of a Ward orTrifon for Debtors, and a House of Correction ; but forasmuch as the erecting, com*

4 pleting and finishing of the said intended Jail, Prison, and House of Correction, will necessarily require

4 a considerable Sum of Money, beyond what has been already advanced by his Majesty’s Order as afore-

4 (Aid, and no Money can or may be raised or collected for that Purpose without the Aid and Authority

4 of Parliament Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice

Bud Confetti of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled.

4 Court, or by an exttavagant, dissolute, idle, or negligent Course of Life, shall disable themselves from

4 paying their just Debts-, or from obstinate or di(honest Principles shall refuse to pay such Debts ;* be it

therefore further enacted, That in case it shall appear to any three or more of the said Commissioners,

being the Mijority of such Commiflnners upon the Hearing of any Cause, or afterward, to their

full Satisfaction in open Court, that the Debtor or Defendant therein is unable to pay and discharge the

Debt thereby demanded, from some unavoidable Accident, and not from any of the aforesaid causes, then

and in that Cafe such Commissioners shall not award Execution against the Body of such last-mentioned

Defendant or Debtor; nor shall the Bed and Bedding, or Working Tools, of himself or Family", be takerv.

or sold by any Fieri Facias, or other Execution; any Thing herein-before contained to the contrary not-

withfta riding.

being the major Part of such Commissioners at any Court, upon Complaint and Proof thereof made, upon

the Oath or Oaths of one or more credible Witness or Witnesses, to order such Gaoler to pay the Sum-

or Sums of Money which the Person or Persons so escaping had been adjudged to pay, to the Plaintiff or

Plaintiffs at whose In ft* nee and Request such Person or Persons were committed, and such Gaoler or

Keeper is hereby made liable thereto; and on Demand made thereof, and upon his Refusal so to do, the

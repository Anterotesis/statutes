payment, shall be repealed; and instead thereof, the Penalty for the first Offence shall be any Sum not

shall judge to be moil proper 5 and every such pecuniary Penalty shall be applied, under the Direction of

the Justices before whom the Conviction shall be, in Manner following ; (that is to say) In the first Place,

the Expences of the Prosecution shall be thereout defrayed; and.then such Satisfaction shall be made there-

out to the Party or Parties injured, as the said Justices shall think proper; and afterwards so much of the

said Penalty shall be paid to the Informer or Informers as such Justices shall th nk fit, not exceeding, in any

Cafe, ten Pounds; and the Remainder, if any, shall be paid and distributed to and amongst the Poor of

rities as such Justices shall appoint: And if fujch pecuniary Penalty as aforesaid shall not be paid on Con-

VI. And whereas such Materials as aforesaid, which have been purloined or embezzled, are frequently

received by Persons knowing the fame to have been so purloined or embezzled; and such Materials

being afterwards worked up, or otherwise disposed of, renders it difficult to convict such Offenders;* be

it therefore enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That, from and after the said first Day of July, one thou-

sand seven hundred and seventy-seven, when any Person or Persons shall be brought or charged upon Oath,

before any two or rtiore Justices of the Peace, by virtue of this Act, with being suspeded of, or with having

wrought or unwrought, mixed or unmixed, knowing the fame to have been either purloined or embezzled,

or received from some Person or Persons not intitled to dispose thereof, and it shall be made appear upon

of Witnesses, to the Satisfaction of such Justices, that such Person or Persons hath or have puiloined or

embezzled, or hath or have received any such Materials as aforesaid, knowing the fame to have been pur-

loined or embezzled, or received from some Person or Persons not intitled to dispose thereof, it shall and

may be lawful for such Justices, or for the Justices at their General or General Quarter Sessions of the

Peace, and they are hereby respectively authorised and impowered (if they shall think fit) to convict such

Person or Persons of having purloined or embezzled, or of having received such Materials as aforesaid,

knowing the fame to have been purloined or embezzled, or received from some Person or Persons not in-

titled to dispose thereof, although no Proof shall be given to whom such Materials belong; and the Person

or Persons so convicted shall, for every such Offence, be subject to such and the like Penalties and Punish-

Materials as aforesaid, knowing the fame to have been purloined or embezzled, are by this Act subject and

liable to.

VII. And whereas, by the said recited Act of the twenty-second of King George the Second, it was

4 also enacted, That if any Person or Persons intruded with any of the Materials therein and herein-before

4 mentioned, in order to prepare, work up, or manufacture the fame, should not use all such Materials in

the preparing, working up, or manufacturing, of the fame, and should neglect or delay, for the Space of

4 twenty-one Days after such Materials should be prepared, worked up, or manufactured, to return (if re-

4 quired by the Owner or Owners of such Materials so to do) so much of the said Materials as should not

4 be used as aforesaid, to the Person or Persons intruding him, her, or them therewith, such Neglect or

4 Delay should be deemed a purloining or embezzling of such Materials; and the Person or Persons so ne-

4 electing or delaying, being thereof convicted in Manner therein-before prescribed for the Conviction of

4 Offenders against the said Act, should suffer the like Punishment as Persons convicted of purloining or

embezzling any of the Materials therein-before mentioned, are by the said Act rendered subject and liable

4 to: And whereas the Space of twenty-one Days, allowed by the said recited Act, is thought too long a

4 Time to be allowed for returning the fa;d Materials, under the Circumstances, and in Manner afo;ef*id ;

and it may be proper to make the Punishment for not returning such Materials the fame as for purloining

or embezzling under this Act;* be rt therefore further enacted, That, from and after the said first Day and altered

of July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, so much of the said recited Act as allows twenty-

one Days after the preparing, working up, or manufacturing the said Materials, for returning so much of

the said Materials as shall not be used in such preparing, working up, or manufacturing, and declares that

the Punishment f«>r not so returning the Lid Materials within the said Time, shall be the fame as under the

said Act isdireded for purloining or embezzling, shall be repealed; and only eight Days shall be allowed

for returning the said Materials in Manner aforesaid; and the Punishment for not returning them within

the said eight Days shall be the fame as is determined by this Act directed to be infl ded for purloining or embezzling.

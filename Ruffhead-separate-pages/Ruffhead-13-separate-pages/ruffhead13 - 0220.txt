4 which were to have Continuance until the twenty-fourth Day o{June, one thousand seven hundred and

4 eighty-three; all which Duties the said Act directed to be paid to the Bailiffs and Burgesses of Scarbo-

4 rough, to be applied for the Purpose of enlarging, extending, improving, and repairing the said Pier and

4 Harbour; and to be coilefted, recovered, managed, and disposed of, by such Ways and Means, and

4 under such Regulations, Directions, Restrictions, Penalties, and Provisoes, as are therein mentioned :

4 And whereas, by an Act made in the twenty-fifth Year of the Reign of his said late Majesty. to explain,

4 amend, and make more effectual, the said former Act, Provision was tnade for taking the Powers, cre-

4 granted by the said two former Acts, it was enacted, That the aforesaid Duty upon Coals should be (save

4 as therein-after mentioned) continued, from and after the Expiration thereof, for and during the further

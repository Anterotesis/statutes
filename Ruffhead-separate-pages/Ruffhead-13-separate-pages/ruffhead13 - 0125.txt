tended to be drawn back, that the particular Glass which shall be intended to be exported as aforesaid, and

every Part thereof, shall be shipped and exported, and that the fame, or any Part thereof, {hall not be

rdanded or brought again into any Part or Parts of Greet Britain; which Security the Officer of Excise of

the said Port where such Glass shall be exported is hereby directed and authorised to take, in his Majesty’s

Name, and to his Use, instead of the Security directed by the said recited Act to be taken by the Customer

or Collector of the respective Port for such Exportation; and then the said Officer of Excise of the said

Port where such Glass shall be exported shall give a Certificate under his Hand, expressing the Quality

and true Weight of the Glass so exported, and that the fame was shipped in his Prelence, and that suffi-

cient Security has been given for the due exporting thereof; which Certificate being produced to the Col-

ledtor appointed to receive the said Duties upon Glass, or such Collector of the Port where the said Glass

was exported, he shall forthwith pay or allow to the Persons or Agents so exporting the fame a Drawback

or Allowance of eighteen Shillings and eight-pence per hundred Weight for all Plate, Flint, Enamel,

Stained, or Paste Glass, and for all Phial Glass, made in Great Britain; and seven Shillings per hundred

4 XXXVI. And whereas it frequently happens that the Collectors of the Duties, under the Manage-

4 ment of the Commissioners of Excise, who are by Law required and impowered to administer the

4 Oath or Affirmation, and thereupon to give Certificates that such Duties have been duly paid or secured,

4 are frequently absent from Home in the Execution of other Parts of their Duty, whereby the Export-

4 ation of such Wares or Merchandise may be greatly delayed be it therefore enacted by the Authority

aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful for such Person or Persons as {hall be appointed by the Commis-

sioners of Excise in Great Britain respectively for the Time being, or the major Part of them, within

their several Distrids, to administer such Oath or Affirmation, in the Absence of the respective Collectors,

to the Persons so applying for the fame, in order to export such Wares and Merchandises as aforesaid, and

to give gratis to such Persons such Certificate or Certificates as required by the several Acts whereby f uch

Duties are respectively charged upon such Wares or Merchandises, in the lame Manner as the Collectors

of Excise are by Law required and impowered to do.

4 XXXVII. And whereas Frauds have been committed by relanding or unshipping of Glass, after be-

4 ing entered and shipped for Exportation, and also by entering broken Glass or waite Glass fur Export-

4 ation, in order to obtain the Drawback or Allowance for the fame, as if it was Glals exported for Mer-

4 chandife, which was the true Intent and Meaning of the said recited Act; now the better to prevent

4 such Abuses,’ be it further enacted and declared by the Authority aforesaid, That if, after the shipping

of any Glass to be exported pursuant to this present Act, in order to obtain the respective Allowances or

Drawbacks therein mentioned, the Glass so {hipped to be exported, or any Part thereof, {hall be fraudu-

lently unshipped, unladed, relanded, or put into any other Ship, Vdlel, or Boat, within the Kingdom of

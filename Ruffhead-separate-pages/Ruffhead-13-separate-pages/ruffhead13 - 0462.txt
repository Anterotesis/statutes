€ \\T HERE AS by an Act, made in the seventeenth Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, in-

4 V V tituled. An Act for granting to his Majesty certain Duties on Licences to be taken out by all Persons

4 acting as Auctioneers 5 and certain Kates and Duties on all Lands, Houses, Goods, and other Things, sold by

4 Auction; and upon Indentures, Leases, Bonds, Deeds, and other Instruments ; certain Duties were imposed

4 on all Licences to be taken out by Persons felling Estates, Goods and Chattels, by Auction, and on the

4 Purchase-money of the Things so fold : And whereas the Powers, Rules, and Regulations, therein pre-

4 feribed for ascertaining, securing, and collecting, the said Duties, and for preventing Frauds therein,

4 have been found ineffectual to secure the Payment thereof; and the said Duties have, by reason of various

4 Frauds and Evasions, been greatly decreased or withheld: for Remedy thereof, and for the better securing

4 the Payment of the said Duties/ be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the

Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament af-

sembled, and by the Authority of the same, That, from and after the fifth Day of July, one thousand

seven hundred and seventy-nine, the several Powers, Rules, Regulations, and Provisions, by the said Act

given and directed, for granting Licences to Auctioneers, and for collecting and managing the Duties by

the said Act imposed on Licences to be granted to Persons felling by Auction, and on the Purchase-money

of the Estates, Goods, and Effects so fold, shall cease and determine, and be no longer used, except in all

Cafes relating to the Recovery of any Arrears which may at that Time remain unpaid of the said Duties,

or to any Penalty or Forfeiture which shall have been incurred upon, or at any Time before, the said fifth

4 the twenty-ninth Day of September, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, there shall be raffed,

4 levied, collected, and paid, in such Manner as in the said Act is mentioned, to and for the Use of his Ma«

4 jesty, his Heirs and Successors, the Sum of Six-pence for every twenty Shillings, out of the Purchase-

4 money arising by Sale at Auction of all Plate and Jewels : And whereas the said Duty of Six-pence in

* every twenty Shillings, out of the Purchase-money of the said Goods, has been found to prevent, in a

4 great Measure, the Sale of the said Goods by Auction, to the Prejudice of the Revenue intended to be

4 raised by the said Act / be it therefore enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That, from and after the said

fifth Day of July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine, the said Duty of Six-pence in every

twenty Shillings, out of the Purchase-Money of the said Goods, shall be, and the fame is hereby repealed \

like Manner as the other Rates and Duties, granted by the said recited Act upon Sales by Auction, are

directed to be paid, accounted for, recovered, and applied; any Thing therein, or in this present Act,

contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

4 III. And, for the better preventing the like Frauds, and for the more effectual securing the Payment

4 of thf Duties by the said Act imposed/ be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That, from and

after the said fifth Day of July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine, no Person whatever, not

already licensed according to the said Act, who now, or at any Time or Times hereafter doth or shall ex-

crcife the Trade or Business of an Auctioneer, or Seller by Commission, at any Sale of any Estate, Goods,

or Effects whatsoever, by Outcry, knocking down of Hammer, by Candle, by Lot, by Parcel, or by any

other Mode of Sale at Auction, or whereby the highest Bidder is deemed to be the Purchaser, or who shall

by public Sale or otherwise, by way of Auction as aforesaid, in any Manner whatsoever, without first

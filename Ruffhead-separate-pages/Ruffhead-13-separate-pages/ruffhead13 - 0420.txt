diate and immediate, according to their respCCUve Interests, are hereby required to allow such Deductions

and Payments, upon Receipt of the Residue or their Rent; and every Tenant paying such Assessment or

Rate {hall be acquitted and discharged for so much Money as the said Assessment or Rate {hall amount to,

as if the fame had been actually paid to the Person or Persons entitled to the Rents of such Lands or

Grounds, except where there is a Lease for three or more Years to come from the Commencement of this

Act, in which Cafe the Proportion of the Assessment or Rate, which the Tenant ought to bear and pay

in Consideration of the Benefit he receives, shall be adjudged and awarded by five or more of the Commis-

XIX. Provided always, and be it hereby enacted and declared. That in case any of the said Fen Linds

and Low Grounds {hall at any Time hereafter be untenanted or unoccupied, and that no suficient Diitrcfs

can be found for levying the said Rates and Taxes, then the said Lands and Grounds chargeable therewith

{hall always remain a Security for Payment thereof, and all Goods and Chattels which wall at any Time

thereafter be found thereon (except of such Person or Persons who shall occupy the fame under or by

virtue of a Hiring from the Commissioners) shall and may be difirained, kept, appraised, and fold in Man-

ner aforesaid, until all Arrears of the said Rates and Taxes, and the Charges of such Distress, shall be

fully paid and satisfied; and also that it {hall and may be lawful to and for the Collector or Collectors, Re-

ceiver or Receivers, for the Time being, to let the fame Lands and Grounds to be mown and fed, from

Year to Year only, for the best Rent that can be gotten for the fame, and to take and receive the Rents

and Profits thereof for the Use of the said Commissioners, to be applied for the Purposes of this Act, until

all Arrears of the said Taxes, Rates, Penalties, and Charges, {hall be fully satisfied and paid, rendering

the Overplus of such Rents and Profits (if any), after discharging such Arrears, upon Demand, to the

Owner and Owners of such Lands and Grounds.

XX. And be it further enacted, That where any of the said Rates and Taxes hereafter to be imposed

and set by virtue of this Act, or which have been assessed or imposed by virtue of the said Act hereby in-

tended to be amended and rendered more effectual, {hall hereafter be, or heretofore have been, in Arrear

and unpaid by the Space of two whole Years together, then the said Commissioners, or any five or more

of them, at any of their Quarterly Meetings, {hall have full Power and Authority to fell to the best Bid-

der, at a public AuCtion, so much of the said Lands and Grounds, in respect of which any Tax {hall be so

in Arrear, as {hall be sufficient to raise such Taxes and Arrears of Taxes, and also the Penalties incurred

for Nonpayment thereof as aforesaid, by Writing under the Hands and Seals of five or more of the said

Commissioners, without Stamps; and also, if all or any Part of the said Lands on which the Taxes al-

ready set and imposed, or hereafter to be set and imposed, cannot be sold at such AuCtion for the Amount

and effectual, and the Person or Persons to whom such Sale shall be made shall be a lawful Purchaser of so

much of the said Lands or Grounds as {hall be so fold, to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever.

‘ XXI. And whereas many Difficulties have arisen with regard to the Taxes due on certain Lands

called Commons, within the Limits aforesaid, many of which said Taxes are {till unpaid and in Arrear, on

‘ Account of the Commissioners not being able to ascertain or particularly set out the exaCt Limits or Bounds

4 of the fame, the said Commons having never been held in Severalty, but lying intermixed, and being fed

and depastured in common with other Grounds, by Means whereof the distraining on such Lands, foe

4 Notmayment of the Taxes due thereon, becomes very unsafe and hazardous, and the general Drainage of

the Level, by reason of the said Taxes being unpaid and in Arrear, is greatly impeded; to remedy which

4 Evils/ be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That where any Tax or Taxes, Rate or Rates, is, are*

of {hall be in Arrear and due, for or in respect of any such Common or Commons, Part or Parts of Com-

mon, within the Limits aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful for the Collector or Collectors, Receiver or

Receivers, for the Time being, to let such Common or Commons, Part or Parts of Common, without

identifying or setting out the fame by Metes, or any other Bounds or Description, than specifying the

Owner or Owners Name, from Year to Year, only, for the best Rent that can be gotten for the fame*

and to take the Rents and Profits thereof, for the Use of the said Commissioners, to be applied for the

Purposes of this Act, until all Arfears of the said Taxes, Rates. Penalties, and Charges, {hall oe fully paid

and satisfied, rendering the Overplus of such Rents and Profits, if any, after difenarging such Arrears>

upon Demand, to the Owner or Owners of such Common or Commons, Part or Parts of Common.

XXII. And be it further enacted, That when any of the said Rates and Taxes on the said Common or

Commons, or Part or Parts of Common, hereafter to be imposed and set by virtue of this Act, or which

have been assessed or imposed by virtue of the Act hereby intended to be amended and rendered more ef-

fectual , shall hereafter be, or heretofore have been, in Arrear and unpaid by the Space of two whole

Years together, then the said Commissioners, or any five or more of them, at any of their quarterly Meet-

ings, {hall have full Power and Authority to fell to the best Bidder, at a public AifCtion, for the best Price

that can be gotten, all and every the said Common and Commons, Part or Parts of Common, in respect

of which any Tax {hall be so in Arrear, to raise such Taxes, Penalties, and Expences, or any or either ofi

them, incurred by Nonpayment and Sale thereof as aforesaid, by Writing under the Hands and Seals of

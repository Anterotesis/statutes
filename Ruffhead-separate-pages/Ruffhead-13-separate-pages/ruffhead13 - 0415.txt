Att Act to explain, amend, and render more effectual, an Act passed in the seventh Year of

. his present Majesty’s Reign, intituled, An Act for draining and preserving certain Fen Lands

and Low Grounds, lying in the South Level, Part of the Great Level of the Fens commonlp

called Bedford Level, and in the County of Cambridge, between the River Cam, otherwise

. Grant, fVeft, and the Hard Lands of Bottifham, Swaffham Bulbeck, and Swaiffham Prior,

East and for empowering the Governor, Bailiffs, and Commonalty, of the Company of Conserva-

. tors of the Great Level of the Fins, commonly called Bedford Level, to fell certain Fen Lands*

j lying within the Limits aforesaid, commonly called Inverted Lands.

tT7 HEREAS the Commissioners appointed by and chosen in pursuance of an Act, passed in the

4 Vy# seventh Year of the Reign of his present Majesty King George the Third, intituled, An Act fdr

4 draining and preserving certain Fen Lands and Low Grounds lying in the South Level, Part of the Great Levd

4 of the Fens commonly called Bedford Level, and in the County of Cambridge, between the River Cam, other-

wife Grant, West, and the Hard Lands of Bottifham, Swaffham, Bulbeck, and Swaffham Prior, Eafi\

and for empowering the Governor, Bailiffs, and Commonalty, of the Company of Conservators of the Great

4 Level of toe Fens, commonly called Bedford Level, to fell certain Fen Lands, lying within the Limits aforesaid%

4 commonly called Inverted Lands, have, in purfoance of the Powers and Authorities thereby granted,

and for the due Execution of the said Act, from Time to Time borrowed considerable Sums of Money

4 upon the Credit of the Tolls and Taxes charged and to be charged by virtue of the said Act, and have

4 expended Part thereof, amounting to the Sum of twothoufand eight hundred Pounds and upwards, in

4 repairing the East Bank of die River Grant, lying between Clay Hythe Ferry and the Sluice commonly

x called Reach or Upwere Sluice, and in making a cross Bank from the Town of Reach to the East Bank of

the River Grant, and the Residue thereof in feeuring out and deepening the Loads mentioned in the said

4 Act, and in making Banks by the Sides thereof, and in amending, to the great Benefit of the Naviga*

4 tion, such Banks, after they have been damaged by Horses haling thereon, and also in ercfting Engines-

% and doing other Works of draining, which have been of considerable Use to manjr of the Lands in the^

4 said District: And whereas it is found by Experience, that the Boundary of the said District by the for-

14 mer Act, may in some Parts of it, for the better Security of the Draining, be enlarged, without Prejudice

% or Injury to any private Owner or Occupier of Lands within the same: And whereas the Tolls granted.

by the said Act for repairing the said East Bank of the River Grant, and fcowering out and deepening the

4 several Loads, and repairing, maintaining, and supporting, the several Banks of the several Loads within

the said District, are insufficient for and unequal to the Expence thereof, so that the Land-owners in the

said District axe not able to support the said Works, or to complete such other Works as are necessary

4 for draining their Land*, and paying the Interest of the Monies already borrowed, and laid out in the

4 crefting, making, and Maintenance thereof, insomuch that the Banks, so necessary both for the Naviga*

4 tion and Draining, as well as the other Works now made, must soon fall into Decay, and the said Dif-

4 trift be again reduced to a drowned Condition, and so remain, without such reasonable Contribution

4 from the Navigators, and others using the said Banks, as shall be in some Sort adequate to the Expencea*

the said Commissioners have and shall hereafter be put to for maintaining the fame: And whereas neither

the Tolls or Taxes granted by the said Act have been regularly and duly paid, the Tolls having been*

4 evaded, and some of the Taxes left in Arrear, for want of sufficient Powers to enforce the regular Pay*

4 ment thereof* which if suffered so to continue, will defeat the Purposerof thefatd Act :* May it there*

fore please your Majesty that it may be enacted* and be it enacted by the King's most Excellent*

Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual spid Temporal* and Commons, in

this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said Boundary, instead

of going, as under the former Act, from Common Hardtidge Gate to a certain Place called Barr Hill, (half

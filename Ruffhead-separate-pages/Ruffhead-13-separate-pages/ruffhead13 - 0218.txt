4 Encouragement towards bringing Offenders to Justice, in all such Cafes as are within the Purview of the

4 said Statutes; but nevertheless it has been found by Experience, that the said herein-before recited Sta-

4 tute of the twenty-seventh Year of his said late Majesty, with regard to Persons appearing on Recogni-

4 zance in any Court to give Evidence as aforesaid, extends only to poor Persons, such Court also con-

4 fidcring their Circumstances; and also does not extend to Persons appearing on Subpoena to give Evidence:

4 And whereas the said Act of the twenty-fifth Year of his said late Majesty, with regard to Prosecutors,

4 directs the Court to consider the Circumstances of such Prosecutor, and also gives him Relief only where

the Offender is convicted: And whereas it is just and reasonable, artd may tend in future to the Preven-

4 tion of Crimes, or to the due Prosecution of all Offenders against the Laws, that every Profecu for to

4 Conviction, and every Person so appearing on Recognizance or Subpoena to give Evidence, should be

4 allowed his reasonable Expences, and also, in case he be poor, a reasonable Satisfaction for his Trouble

and Loss of Time; and that such Allowance should be made to Prosecutors as aforesaid, even though the

4 Person so accused be acquitted, provided it shall appear to such Court, before whom the said Prisoner

4 shall have been tried, that there was a reasonable Ground of Prosecution, and that the Prosecutor hath'

4 bona fide prosecuted ;* be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That, from and after the passing

of this Act, it shall and may be in the Power of the Court before whom any Person has been tried and con-

vifted of any Grand or Petit Larceny, or other Felony, or before whom any Person has been tried and:

acquitted of any Grand or Petit Larceny, or other Felony, in case it shall appear to the said Court that

there was a reasonable Ground of Prosecution, and that the said Prosecutor hath bona fide prosecuted, to

ordfr, upon Prayer of the said Prosecutor, the Treasurer of the County, Riding, or Division, in which the

Offence shall have been committed, or shall have been supposed to have been committed, to pay unto such

Prosecutor such Sum of Money as to the said Court shall seem reasonable, not exceeding the Expences'

which it shall appear to the Court the Prosecutor was bona fide put unto in carrying on such Prosecution,

making, in case the said Prosecutor shall appear to the Court to be in poor Circumstances, a reasonable

Allowance to such Prosecutor for Trouble and Loss of Time; which Order the Clerk of Assize, or Cleric

of the Peace, respectively, is hereby directed and required forthwith to make out and deliver unto such

Prosecutor, upon being paid for the fame the Sum of one Shilling, and no more; and the Treasurer of the

said County, Riding, or Division, is hereby authorised and required, upon Sight of such Order, forthwith

to pay to such Prosecutor, or other Person authorised to receive the same, such Sum of Money as aforesaid,

and (halU>e allowed the fame in his Accounts.

VIII. And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be in the Power of

the Court, where any Perfoiv shall appear, on Recognizance or Subpoena, to give Evidence as to any

Grand or Petit Larceny or other Felony, whether any Bill of Indictment be preferred or not to any Grand-

Jury, provided the said Person shall, in the Opinion of the said Court, bona fide have attended the said

Court in Obedience to such Recognizance or Subpoena, to order the Treasurer of the County, Riding, of

Division, in which the Offence shall have been committed, or shall have been supposed to have been com-

mitted, to pay unto such Person such Sum of Money as to the said Court shall seem reasonable, not ex-

ceeding the Expences which it shall appear to the said Court the said Person was bona fide put unto by

reason of the said Recognizance and Subpoena, making, in case the said Person shall appear to the Court ta

be in poor Circumstances, a reasonable Allowance to such Person for Trouble and Loss of Time; which

Order the Clerk of Assize, or Clerk of the Peace, respectively, is hereby directed and required forthwith ta

make out and deliver to such Person, upon being paid for the fame the Sum of Sixpence, and no more;

and the Treasurer of the said County, Riding, or Division, is hereby authorised and required, upon Sight

of such Order, forthwith to pay to such Person, or other Person authorised to receive the same, such Sun*

of Money as aforesaid, and shall be allowed the fame in his Accounts.

IX. Provided r.evertheless, and be it further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for his MajestyV

Justices of the Peace, in and for any County, Riding, Division, City, Town Corporate, Franchise, or

Liberty, in Quarter Sessions assembled, to lay down or alter, from Time to Time, such Rules and Regu-

lations, as to any Costs or Charges thereafter to be allowed to any Person whatsoever, by virtue of any

Part of this Act, for the better carrying the Intent of any Part of this Act into Execution, and for the pre-

venting any unnecessary Expence, as to them shall seem most just and reasonable; which Rules and Regu-

lations, having received the Approbation and Signature of one or more of his Majesty’s Judges of Oyer and

Terminer, or General Gaol Delivery, at the Assizes for the County wherein such Rules and Regulations*

shall have been made, shall be binding, and not otherwise, on all Persons whatsoever; and no Person

whatsoever shall be allowed any greater Sum of Money, by virtue of this Act, than according to the said“

Rules and Regulations so approved of as aforesaid, any Thing herein contained to the contrary thereof in

anywise notwithstanding.

X. And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Action or Suit shall be commenced"

against any Person or Persons for any Thing done in pursuance of this Act; that then, and in every such

Cafe, the Action or Suit shall be brought within six Calendar Months next after the Fv.ft committed; and'

the Defendant or Defendants in such Action or Suit may plead the General Issue, and give this Act and the

Special Matter in Evidence, at any Trial to be had thereupon, and that the fame was done in pursuance

and by the Authority of this Act: And if it shall appear so to have been done, the Jury shall find for the De-

fendant or Defendants; and if the Plaintiff shall be nonsuit, or discontinue his Action after the Defendant

or Defendants shall have appeared, or if Judgment shall be given, upon any Verdict or Demurrer, againif

the Plaintiff, the Defendant and Defendants shall and may recover Treble Costs, and have the like Re--

ttedy for the fame as the Defendant or Defendants hath or have in other Cafes by Law.

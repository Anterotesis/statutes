Pounds, with the Interest thereof, and raising the said fifty-eight thousand five hundred Pounds, as for

defraying the Expences of lighting, watching, cleansing, and repairing, the said Budge when built 5

and that it would tend to remove many Inconvenienctes if the Ground and Soil of the said River of 7,5001. for ea-

Thames, between the Weft Corner of PowelTs Wharf near Puddle dock, in the said City of London, and fc*nk,g At

the East Corner of Robert's Wharf near Milford-laney in the said County of Middlesex, was inefofed and wneti

embanked, the Expence of making which Embankment was estimated at the Sum of seven thousand

five hundred Pounds; and that the Passage over London-bridge was subject to a prescriptive Toll, ap-

propriated to the Support of the said Bridge, upon all Carts, Waggons, and other Carriages, passing

over the fame to and from the said City, loaden with any kind of Goods or Provisions which Toll was

at that Time in Lease for twenty-one Years at a Fine of two thousand one hundred Pounds, and under

a yearly Rent of seven hundred and thirty-five Pounds; and that it would also be of general Advantage

that the Passage over the said Bridge should be freed and exempted as soon as might be from the Payment

of such Tolls; the Redemption of which Tolls, and the Purchase of which Lease, were estimated at the

Sum of thirty thousand Pounds: And also reciting, That the then Gaol of Newgate, which is not only

the County Gaol of Middlesex as well as of London, but also the General Prison for Smugglers, and*

Debtors to the Crown, from all Parts of the Kingdom, was so ill-contrived as not 'to admit of a sufficient

Supply of fresh Air and Water, from which Cirr urn fiances the fame was in general unhealthy, and

often visited with a malignant Fever called The Gaol Dislempery the fatal Effects of which had sometimes

extended beyond the Priion Walls; and that the said Gaol was so old and ruinous as to be incapable of

any effectual Alteration or Repair, and the Charge of building a more airy and commodious one in its

Stead was estimated at the Sum of fifty thousand rounds; and also reciting, That the House or Building an*

called The Royal Exchange, within the said City of London (the daily Place of Resort of Merchants,

Traders, Mariners, and others, from all Parts of this Kingdom, and from many foreign Countries),

was so much decayed, that the utter Ruin thereof was apprehended unlefe the fame should be speedily

and effectually repaired, which necessary Reparations were estimated at the Sum of ten thousand Pounds,

for which the Funds then subsisting were insufficient; and that the said several Sums of fifty-eight thou-

sand five hundred Pounds, seven thousand five hundred Pounds, thirty thousand Pounds, nfty thousand

Pounds, and ten thousand Pounds, amounting together to the Sum or one hundred and fifty-six thou-

sand Pounds, could net be raised, nor any new Fund provided for Repayment of the said Sum of one

hundred and forty-four thousand Pounds, with the Interest thereof, without the Aid and Authority of

Parliament: And also reciting, That the Surplusses which, at the Time of passing the said A<9, made

and passed in the twenty-full Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, had arisen,

and the Surplusses which had since arisen from the said Fund, bad been applied according to the Direc-

tions of the said Act, and thereby the said Capital Debt, due to the Orphans and other Creditors of the

said City of London, was, on the twenty-fourth Day of June, in the said Year one thousand seven hun-

dred and sixty-iix, xeduced to the Sum of six hundred and ten thousand eighty-four Pounds six Shillings

and Ten-pence, and that (computing the future Surplusses at a Medium of the lad five Years) the

Whole might be expc&ed to be paid off and discharged by the twenty-fifth Day of March> which will

be in the Year one thousand eight hundred and three: And that if the said Imposition of Sixpence for

every Chaldron or Ton of Coals or Culm was to be further continued to the twenty-ninth Day of Sep*

tember? which willbe in the Year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, the said Fund created oy

the said A & of the fifth and sixth Years of King JfUliam and Queen Marjy with the Addition thereto

of one thousand five hundred Pounds per Annum, would (it was computed) be sufficient in that Time to

discharge the Principal and Interest not only of the said Debt due to the said Orphans and other Cre-

ditors of the said City, but of the said further Sums of one hundred and fifty-six thousand Pounds, and

one hundred and forty-four thousand Pounds: And further reciting, That the said Mayor and Com-

monalty and Citizens were willing and desirous that the City’s Estates and Revenues (bould, from and

after the twenty-fourth Day of Juney in the Year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven, until the

said twenty-ninth Day of September, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, be charged with the

Payment of the said yearly Sum of one thousand five hundred Pounds towards the Increase of the said

Fund for the Purposes aforesaid, over and above the several Sums with which the said Estates and Re-

venues then flood charged; it was thereby enabled (amongst other Things), That it should and might

be lawful to an6 for the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons, of the City of London, in Common Council

assembled, and they were thereby empowered and required, with all convenient Speed, to pull down the

said Gaol of Newgate, and to remove, dispose of, or destroy, the Materials thereof as they should think

fit (having a Regard to the Health and Safety of his Majesty’s Subjefls), and to build a spacious and

commodious new Gaol upon or near the Place where the then Gaol flood; provided always. That the

Money which should arise from the Sale of such of the Materials as should be* thought expedient to be

fold, mould be applied towards the Expence of such new Gaol: And to render the Access as well to the

said new Gaol, as to the Sessions-house in the Old Bailey, more easy and convenient, the said Mayor,

Aldermen, and Commons, in Common Council assembled, were thereby also empowered and authorised

to widen, enlarge, or improve, such of the Streets, Ways, and Passages, adjoining or leading to the

said then intended new Gaol and Sessions-house, or either of them, as they mould judge necessary for

that Purpose: And it was thereby provided and enabled, That the said new Gaol when built should be

the County Gaol of and for the said City of London, and of and for the County of Middlesex, in like

Manner as the then Gaol was by Law, Usage, or Prescription; and the said Mayor, Aldermen, and

Commons, in Common Council assembled, were thereby invested with proper Powers for the Purpose

of building the said then intended Gaol, and for the Purchase of such Houses, Lands, Tenements, or

Hereditaments, as they should judge fit to be purchased, removed, or pulled down* for that Purpose:

And it was thereby enacted, That it should and might be lawful to and for the said Mayor, Aldermen,

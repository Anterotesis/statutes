4 the Prosecution of this great Business the said Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons, in Common Council

4 assembled, have already laid out the said Sum of fifty thousand Pounds: And whereas the said Mayor,

4 Aldermen, and Commons, in Common Council assembled, have also, out of the Cash of the said City,

4 expended the Sum of fifteen thousand Pounds in creating a new Sessions house, and the further Sum of

4 six thousand two hundred Pounds for the Purchase of several Houses in the Old Bailey* in order to make

4 the new Gaol more healthy, and the Avenues thereto more convenient: And whereas if an Infirmary to

4 the said Gaol was built, the fame would greatly contribute to the Health of the Prisoners, and thereby

4 be of great public Utility : And whereas the Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City of Lendon^

4 are seized of and well intitled to the Inheritance in Fee-simple in Possession of and in a Piece or Parcel of

4 Ground near or adjoining to the said new Gaol proper for the Scite of such Infirmary, whereupon they

4 propose and are denrous that the fame should be erected and built: And whereas great and unforeseen

4 Expences have been incurred in the freeing the said Gaol, and in purchasing Houses, Lands, and Tene-

4 ments, for that Purpose, and in widening, enlarging, and improving, divers Streets, Ways, and Paf-

4 sages, adjoining and leading thereto, in pursuance and Exercise of the Powers and Authorities given by

4 the said Act of the seventh Year of his present Majesty: And whereas, by Estimates delivered to the said

4 Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons, in Common Council assembled, there will be required (over and

4 above the said several Sums of fifteen thousand Pounds, and six thousand two hundred Pounds, so cx-

4 pended out of the Cash of the said City) an additional Sum of twenty thousand Pounds for the Purpose

4 of building such Infirmary, and completing the said Gaol, with the Appurtenances; and if the said

4 Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons, in Common Council assembled, were enabled to raise such further

4 Sum of twenty thousand Pounds, to be appliejJ for the Purpose of building/uch Infirmary, and com-

4 pleting the said Gaol, with the Appurtenances, and the like further Sum of twenty thousand Pounds, to

4 be applied towards reimbursing the said City the said several Sums of fifteen thousand Pounds, and fix

4 thousand two hundred Pounds, so expended out of the Cadi of the said City as aforesaid, upon the Cre-

4 dit of the Surpluses to arise from the said Fund, it appears that such further Charges, as well as the

4 Whole of the Debt and Sums of Money already charged thereon, will be paid off ana discharged wiihia

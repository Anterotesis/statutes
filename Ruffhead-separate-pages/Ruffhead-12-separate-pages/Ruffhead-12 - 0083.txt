CAP. XXXV.

An Act to enable the Commissioners for executing the Office of Treasurer of his Majesty’s

Exchequer, or the Lord High Treasurer for the Time being, to compound certain Debts

due to his Majesty, and affecting the Estates heretofore of Charles Mason Esquire, deceased,

in the Counties of Montgomery and Salop \ and, upon Payment of such Composition, to

discharge and exonerate the said Estates therefrom.

WHEREAS it appears by the general Certificate of his Majesty’s Imprefts, that Charles Mason

Esquire, late Treasurer of the lranfport Service, on the Foot of his final Account of that Service

4 to the nineteenth of Aprils one thousand seven hundred and eight, was indebted to the Crown the Sum

4 of three thousand one hundred and twenty Pounds, twelve Shillings and Three-pence: And whereas

by a Decree of the High Court of Chancery, made and pronounced on or about the ninth Day of Decent-

4 her^ in the twelfth Year of the Reign of Queen Anne, in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hun-

4 died and thirteen, in a Cause between Sir Bybye Lake Baronet, Son, Heir, and Executor, of Thomas

4 Lake Esquire, then deceased. Plaintiff, and Charles Mason Esquire, Thomas Paine, Joseph Newell, and

4 George Newell9 Defendants; and also in a cross Cause between the said Charles Mason Plaintiff, and

4 Sir B\bye Lake Baronet, Thomas Paine, Joseph Neivcll, George Newell, Charles Turner, Sherrardy

the then Attorney General of the said Queen, William Poultney, and Arthur Lakey Defendants 5 after

4 dating therein (amongst other Things) certain Mortgages and Securities, whereby all the Estates of the

4 said Charles Mason were conveyed and made over to the said Thomas Lakey and others, his Trustees for

4 securing unto the said Thomas Lake several large Sums of Money therein mentioned, and then due to

the said Sir Bybye Lake, as his Executor; and also dating that the said Joseph and George Newell, being ‘

4 indebted to her said Majesty, an Extent issued out of the Court of Exchequer against them, and that, by an

4 Inquisition taken thereon, the said Charles Mason was found to be indebted to the said Joseph and George

4 Newell in the Sums of three thousand five hundred Pounds, and four thousand Pounds, being so much

4 Money paid and expended by them for the Use of the said Charles Mafony and those Debts were seized

4 into her said Majesty’s Hands; it was, amongst other Things, ordered and decreed, That Matter Brown-

4 ing^ one of the Matters of the said Court of Chancery, should take an Account of what was due to the

4 said Sir Bybye Lake for principal Money and Interest on the several Mortgages and Sums of Money

4 therein mentioned, and what upon such Account should be found due, together with the Costs of the

4 said Suits, from the Time of the said Hearing of the said causes, was to be satisfied by a Sale of a com-

4 petent Part of the said Charles Mason s Estates in the said Counties of Montgomery or Salop j but in case

4 such Sale could not be had within a Year* the said Sir Bybye Lake was to be at Liberty to apply to the

4 Court touching the Foreclosure prayed by his Bill; and it was further ordered, that the said Matter

4 should take an Account of all Dealings and Transactions between the said Mason and the Defendants

the Newells, and what, upon such Account, should appear to be due to the said *Mason, including what

4 he should pay on the said Mortgages to the said Lake, the said Mason was to come in as a Creditor with

the rest of the Creditors of the said Newells; but if, upon the said Account, the said Alafon should appear

4 to be indebted to the said Newells, then what he the said Alafon should be so found indebted should be

4 raised, after Satisfaction of the Monies due to the said Lake, by a Sale of a further Part of the said Ma-

4 nors and Estates in the said Counties of Montgomery and Salop; and the Money, when raised, was to be

4 paid towards Satisfaction of the Debt due from the said Newells to the Crown: And whereas the Right

4 Honourable Henry Arthur, late Earl of Powisy deceased, Father of the present Earl, not long before his De-

4 cease, presented a Memorial to the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of his Majesty’s Treasury,

4 thereby dating, amongst other Things, That he had then lately purchased great Part of the said mortgaged

4 Premises; but though the fame, by reason of the great Amount of the said prior Incumbrances, would not

4 be sufficient to answer any Part of the said Debt to the Crown, yet so long as the said Debt continued a

4 Charge on the said Estates, it would be such an Objection to the Title as would prevent the Memorialist

4 from settling or making Sale of any Part thereof, and therefore the said Memorialist prayed to be per-

4 mitted to compound the said Claim of the Crown: And whereas the Lords Commissioners of his Ma-

4 jetty's Treasury referred the said Memorial to the Solicitor of the Treasury to consider the fame, and to

4 report to their Lordships a State of the Cafe, with his^Opinion thereon; and Thomas Nuthall Esquire,

the Solicitor of the Treasury, by his Report, bearing Date the twenty-fourth Day of November, in the

7 4 Year

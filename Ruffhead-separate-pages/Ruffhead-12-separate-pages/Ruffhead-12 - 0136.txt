A.D. 1774, Anno decimo quarto Georgii C. 125

strudion, shall have been tried at the fame Time, for the Space of twelve Months, at the Royal Obfer-

vatory at Greenwich^ then in two Voyages round the Island of Great Britain, in contrary Directions, and

in such other Voyages to different Climates as the said Commissioners shall think fit to direct and appoint j

and after their Return from such Voyages, or any of them, for such longer Time, at the said Observatory,

not exceeding twelve Months, as the said Commissioners shall judge necessary; and also when and fb

soon as the said Commissioners, or two-thirds of them, at the lead, shall, after such Experiments and

Voyages have been made and performed as aforesaid, have declared and determined that such Method is

generally pradicable and useful, and sufficiently exact to determine the Longitude at Sea within the De-

grees or Limits aforesaid, in all Voyages for the Space of six Months (Impediments from cloudy and hazy

Weather excepted); and also When and so soon as the Principles and Practice of such Method are fully

discovered and explained to the Satisfaction of the said Commissioners, or two-thirds of them at least; and

such Author dr Authors, Discoverer or Discoverers, shall have delivered up and affiened over to the said

Commissioners, for the Use of the Publick, the absoluce Property of such Time-Tceepers as shall have*

been tried by such Experiments and Voyages as aforesaid, together with all Places, Descriptions, Theories,

and Explanations, belonging or relating to the fame, and which shall contain the Whole of such Discovery of

the Longitude; and in case the Method proposed shall be by Means of improved Solar and Lunar Tables ;

then, and in such Cafe, the Author or Author* of Aich improved Solar and Lunar Tables, their Exe-

cutors, Administrators, or Assigns, shall be intitled to and have the Reward or Sum of five thousand*

Pounds, if such Solar and Lunar Tables shall prove sufficiently exact to shew the Difiance of the Moon'

from the Sun and Stars in the Heavens, within fifteen Seconds of a Degree, answering to about feveit

Minutes of Longitude, after making an Allowance of half a Degree for the Errors of Observation; and

when it shall appear to the Satisfaction of the said Commissioners, or two-thirds of them,‘at least, that

such Tables are construded' entirely upon the Principles of Gravitation laid down by Skjfaac Newton,

(except with respect to those Elements which must necessarily be taken from astronomical Observations),

and also when the Truth of such Tables shall have been further confirmed and proved by Comparison'

\prich a Series of astronomical Observations made during a Period of eighteen Years and a Half, which is*

deemed the Period of the Irregularities of the Lunar Motions; which Reward shall be due and paid, when when to be

the said Commissioners, or two-thirds of them, at feist, shall have declared and determined, that such p»id«

Tables arc fuffipiently exact, tp fiieyr the Dif^apce of the Moon from the Sun and Stars in the heavens,

within the Limits above mentioned; and also when the Author of Authors of such improved Solar and

Lunar Tables, his or their Executors, jAdrfunistrators, or Assigns, shall have delivered (ip, and assigned

over to the said Commissioners, for the Use of the Publick, the absolute Right and Property to and in

the fame, together with the Theory relating thereunto; ana In case any other Method shall be proposed

for finding the Longitude at Sea besides those before mentioned, that then, and in such Cafe, the first

Author or Authors, Discoverer or Discoverers, of any such Method, his or their Executors, Administra-

tors, or Assigns, shall be intitled to and have the Reward or Sum of five thousand Pounds, if it shall de-

termine the said Longitude within one Degree of a great Circle, or sixty geographical Miles; to thp

Reward or Sum of seven thousandeeciefiastical ecclesiastical five hundred Pounds, if it shall determine the fame to Two-thirds of

that Distance; and to the Reward or Suns of ten thoufaridrPounds, if It shall determine the fame tb one

Jialf of the fame Defiance; wfiich respective Rewards shall be due and paid, so foori as the said Com*

missioners, <of Two-thirdb of thetri, at Teaft, (hill* after proper Trial has been made by their Appoint-

ment and Direction, have determined that such Method shall be generally practicable and useful for finding

the Longitude ^t Sea within the respective Limits above mentioned.

III. And be it further en^ded by the Authority aforesaid, That when and so soon as any such Method Trttfemefffie

or Methods, for thy Discovery of the said Longitude, shall be tried, as before mentioned, and found prat- ^/Ae*

ticable and useful at Sea, arra sufficiently exact to determine the Longitude within any of the Degrees ward*, l0 the

or Limits aforesaid, the said Commissioners, Or Two-thirds bf them, mall certify the fame, under their Anthsra^

Hands and Seals, to the Commissioners of the Navy for the Time being, together with the Name or

Names of the Person or Perfops who (hall4 be the Author or Authors of stich Method or Methods; and

upon the Receipt of such Certificate, the said Comiriissioners of the Navy are hereby authorised and re-

quired to make out a Bill or Bills upon the Treasurer of the Navy, for the respective Sum or Sums of

Money to which the Author or Authors of such Propofols, his or their Executors, Administrators, or

Assigns, shall be intitled by virtue of this Act; which Sum or Sums the said Treasurer is hereby re--

quhed to pay to the said Author or Authors, their Executors, Administrators, or Assigns accordingly, out

of any Money that may be in Hand* unapplied so the Use of the Nay,, according to the true Intent and

Meaning of this Act.

IV. And whereas the several Sums of ^Loney xranjed by the above now-recited Acts, towards making CwrnnMKhCTt

4 Experiments of Proposals for discovering the Longitude at Sea, and for improving the Lunar Tables, of ta

and making other Discoveries or Improvements useful to Navigation, are, by reason of the several Pay- byVormer'

A ment3 made by the Treasurer of the Navy, purfuam to the Directions of the said Acts, not only ex- A«totbeCom-

pended, but, moreover, several Peh(s have been jncvrfed, arid are now growing due for Services tending mWotunif th#'

4 to the Benefit of Navigation, and, more parikuLjrly, for defraying the Expence of the two Observers

who have been sent opt to make nautical and astronomical Observations in,the Southern Hemisphere:

4 And whereas it is highly necVssary that the ford Debts (Would bb discharged, and that ingenious Personi

should be encouraged tomakcifurtbei DUcbveritst amt Improvements useful to Navigation be it fur-

ther enacted by the Aighprify fcfprefoid, That the gbpVe f me rationed Cpmnpissioners for the Discovery of

Longitude at Sea shall and may certify the Amount of such Debts, together with the Names of the Per-

fons to whom the fame shall he respedjvely due, under their Hands and Seals, to the Commissioners of tht

Navy, who are hereby authorised and required to make out a Bill or Bills upon the Treasurer of the Navy

Sox such Sum or Sums of Money as may be ncccfiary for difehafging the said Debts; which Sum or Sums

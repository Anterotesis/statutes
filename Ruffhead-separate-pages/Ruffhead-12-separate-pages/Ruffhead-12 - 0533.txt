said Company of Pnyrietors, their Successors or Assigns, for Tonnage and Wharfage upon the said Canal,

4 LVII. And whereas by an Act, passed in the sixth Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, certain

4 Persons therein named, their Succeuors and Assigns, were incorporated by the Name of The Company of

4 Proprietors of the Stafford (hi re and Worcesterihire Canal Navigation^ and were thereby enabled to make

4 a navigable Canal from the River Severn, between Bewdley ana Titton-brook, in the County of JVorcejlen*

4 to join and communicate with a Canal then intended to be made between the River Trent and the River

4 Mersey., at or near Hiryvjood-millj in the County of Stafford; and to raise such Sums of Money for ao

complishing the said Undertaking as are therein particularly mentioned; which said Sums being found

4 inefficient for completing the said Navigation, the said Company of Proprietors, by another Act, passed

in the tenth Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, were authorised to raise such further Sums of

4 Money as are therein mentioned for completing the fame, and the said Navigation hath been (ince ac-

4 cordingly completed: And whereas a great Inducement to the said Company of Proprietors to under-

4 take the making of the said Navigation was, the Advantage expected to arise from Coals to be navigated

4 on the said Canal in general, ana particularly from Autherley near JVolverhampton, in the said County of

4 Stafford, down to the River Severn, which is a Distance of twenty-five Miles and upwards: And

4 whereas the Navigation intended to be made by virtue of this Act will fall into and communicate with

the said Staffordshire and WorceJlershire Canal Navigation, at or near a certain Place called The River

4 Stour Aqueautt, near Stourton, in the said County of Stafford, which, by the Course of the Staffordshire

and Worcestershire Canal, is about twelve Miles and an Half distant from the River Severn, where the said

4 Staffordshire and WorceJlershire Canal falls into the said River; by means whereof the Owners of Coal-

4 mines lying in the Neighbourhood of Stourbridge will be enabledgreatly to undersell the Owners of

4 Coal-mines lying in the Neighbourhood of pijston, Cofeley> and Tipton, in the County of Stafford, at

the Severn Markets, which will tend to the manifest Injury of the said Collieries as well as 01 the said

4 Staffordshire and JVorcJlershire Canal Navigation, unless Powers are given to the said Company of Pro-

4 prietors of the Staffordshire and WorceJlershire Canal Navigation to regulate their Tonnage upon Coals

in such Manner as to bring the fame, from all the said respective Coal-mines, to the Market of the Pub-

4 lie, upon a nearer Footing of Equality, by advancing the Tonnage in Manner herein after directed upop

the said last mentioned Canal Navigation, and by reducing the Tonnage upon all or any Part of the said

4 Navigation, pursuant to an Agreement for that Purpose: And whereas the said Company of Proprietors

4 of the said Staffordshire and WorceJlershire Canal Navigation were impowered, by virtue of the said Acts

4 of the sixth and tenth Years of the Reign of his present Majesty, to receive and take a Tonnage of one

4 Penny Halfpenny per Mile upon the said Canal Navigation, but were not thereby impowered to make

4 any partial or particular Reduction thereof, and the fame cannot be done without the Aid of Parliament /

be it therefore enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That for the better carrying the said Agreement into

Execution, and for the Benefit and Relief of the Owners of Coal-mines near Bilston, Cofeleu and Tipton%

in the said County of Stafford, and of the Proprietors of the Staffordshire and WorceJlershire Canal Naviga-

tion in Manner aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful, to and for the said Company of Proprietors of the

Staffordshire and WorceJlershire Canal Navigation, their Successors and Assigns, or such Person or Persons

as they shall, from Time to Time, authorise and appoint, to lay, impose, demand, take, and receive,

from Time to Time, and at all Times hereafter, such Tolls, Rates or Duties, upon all Coals which shall

be brought down the said intended Stourbridge Canal Navigation, and which shall be navigated, carried,

or conveyed, upon, through, or along, the said Staffordshire and WorceJlershire Canal Navigation, for the

foie Use and Benefit of the said Company of Proprietors of the said Staffordshire and WorceJlershire Canal

Navigation, as the said Company of Proprietors, their Successors or Assigns, shall think fit, not exceeding

the Sum of Two-pence for every Ton of Coals which shall be so navigated, carried, or conveyed, for the

Space of one Mile, and so in proportion for any Quantity greater or less than a Ton, and for any Space

greater or less than a Mile which said Tolls, Rates, or Duties, shall be paid to such Person or rerions,

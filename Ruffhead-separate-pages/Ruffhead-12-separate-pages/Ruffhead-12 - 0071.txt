Preamble. « WHEREAS Frauds are frequently committed, and Embezzlements made, by Persons employed ,

in the Woollen Manufactory, particularly by their secreting, felling, or otherwise illegally dif-*

c posing of, the working Tools and Materials they are intruded with, by the Weavers taking the Biers

4 out of the Chains, and withholding Part of the Woof or Abb Yarn delivered to them, and by the

4 Pickers, Scribblers, and Spinners, embezzling Part of the Wool and Yarn intruded to them, and also

4 by damping, fleaming, and watering, the Residue, in order to make up the Deficiency in Weight, oc-

4 fioned by such Embezzlements, and also by taking off, picking, or cutting out the Lid, Forrel, or other

4 Marks, of any Piece or Pieces of Cloth, by Means whereof the Clothiers sustain great Damage and

4 Loss: And whereas the Abuses committed in the Clothing Manufacture by Persons carrying, collecting,

4 buying, and receiving, from the Labourers employed in that Manufacture, Ends of Yarn, Wefts,

4 Thrumbs, Short Yarn, and other Refuse of Cloth, Drugget, and other Woollen Goods, and Goods

4 mixed with Wool, have been found very detrimental to the said Manufactures; and the said Frauds and

4 Abuses are frequently carried on and committed so secretly, that the Laws now in being are by no

4 Means sufficient to-prevent the fame, whereby Persons employed in the said Manufacture arc tempted

and encouraged to embezzle, purloin, secrete, fell, and detain, the Goods and Materials with which tiny

4 are intruded by the Clothiers, and other Woollen Manufacturers, so that the Cloth made comes out de-

4 festive in the Subfiance, Perfection, and Excellence, intended by the Clothier, to the Discredit of the Ma-

4 nufacturer, and Injury of the Publick: And whereas it is apprehended such Frauds and Embezzlements*

4 would not be so frequent if the Detection and Punishment of the said Offences were made more easy

and certain :* May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the

affixed to the Specification of the said Engine, should not be understood to extend to any Engine where

the Water to be raised enters the Steam Vefle) itself, or any Vessel having an open Communication with v

it ] 44 Fifthly, Where Motions round an Axis are required, I make the Steam Vessels in Form of hollow

44 Rings, or circular Channels, with proper Inlets and Outlets for the Steam, mounted on horizontal Axles,

44 like the Wheels of a Water Mill; within them are placed a Number of Valves, that suffer any Body

4‘ to go round the Channel in one Direction only; in these Steam Vessels are placed Weights, so ntted to

44 them, as entirely to fill up a Part or Portion of their Channels, yet rendered capable of moving freely

44 in them, by the Means herein after mentioned or specified: When the Steam is admitted in these En-

*’gines, between these Weights and the Valves, it acts equally on both, so as to raise the Weight to one

44 Side of the Wheel, and by the Re-action on the Valves, successively, to give a circular Motion to the

44 Wheel, the Valves opening in the Direction in which the Weights are pressed, but not in the con-

44 trary j as the Steam Vefl'el moves round, it is supplied with Steam from the Boiler, and that which has

44 performed its Office may either be discharged by means of Condenfers, or into the open Air. Sixthly,

44 I intend, in some Cafes, to apply a Degree of Cold, not capable of reducing the Steam to Water, but

44 of contracting it considerably, so that the Engines shall be worked by the alternate Expansion and Con-

44 traCtion of the Steam. Lastly, Instead of using Water to render the Pifton or other Parts of the En-

44 gines Air and Steam tight, I employ Oils, Wax, resinous Bodies, Fat of Animals, Quicksilver, an<h

44 other Metals, in their fluid State.” And whereas the said James Watt hath employed many Years, and

4 a considerable Part of his Fortune, in making Experiments upon Steam, and Steam Engines, com-

4 monly called Fire Engines, with a View to improve those very useful Machines, by which several very

4 considerable Advantages over the common Steam Engines are acquired; but upon account of the many

4 Difficulties which always arise in the Execution of such large and complex Machines, and of the long

4 Time requisite to make thenecefiary Trials, he could not complete his Intention before the End of the

4 Year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-four, when he finished some large Engines as Specimens

4 of his Construction, which slave succeeded so as to demonstrate the Utility of the said Invention: And

4 whereas, in order to manufacture these Engines with the necessary Accuracy, and so that they may be

4 sold at moderate Prices, a considerable Sum of Money must be previously expended in ereCting Mills,

and other Apparatus; and as several Years, and repeated Proofs, will be required before any considerable

4 Part of the Publick can be fully convinced of the Utility of the Invention, and of their Interest to adopt

the fame, the whole Term granted by the said Letters Patent may probably elapse before the said James

4 IVatt can receive an Advantage adequate to his Labour and Invention: And whereas, by furmftiing

'* mechanical Powers at much less Expence, and in more convenient Forms, than has hitherto been done,

4 his Engines may be of great Utility in facilitating the Operations in many great Works and Manufac-

4 tures of this Kingdom; yet it will not be in the rower of the said James IVatt to carry his Invention

4 into that complete Execution which he wifties, and so as to render the fame of the highest Utility to the

4 Publick of which it is capable, unless the Term granted by the said Letters Patent be prolonged, and his

4 Property in the said Invention secured, not only within that Part of Great Britain called England, the

4 Dominion of Walesy the Town of Berwick upon Tweed, and his Majesty’s Colonies and Plantations

4 abroad, but also within that Part of Great Britain called Scotland, for such Time as may enable him to

4 obtain an adequate Recompence for his Labour, Time, and Expence: To the End, therefore, that the

4 said James Watt may be enabled and encouraged to prosecute and complete his said Invention, so that

the rublick may reap all the Advantages to be derived therefrom in their fulleft Extent/ may it please

your most Excellent Majesty (at the humble Petition and Request of the said James Watt) that it may be

enacted, and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent

df the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the

Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act, the foie Privilege and Advantage of Sole Privilege of

making, constructing, and felling the said Engines, herein before particularly described, within the King- waking, &c. said

<lom of Great Britain, and his Majesty’s Colonies and Plantations abroad, shall be, and are hereby de- Enginesveftedm

the Term of twenty-five Years; and that he the said James Watt? his Executors, Administrators, and for 25 Years.

Assigns, and every of them, by himself and themselves, or by his and their Deputy or Deputies, Servants

or Agents, or such others as he the said James Watt, his Executors, Administrators, and Alligns, shall at

any Time agree with, and for no others, from Time to Time, and at all Times, during the Term of

Years herein before mentioned, {hall and lawfully may make, use, exercise, and vend the said Engines,

within the Kingdom of Great Britain, and in his Majesty’s Colonies and Plantations abroad, in such Man-

seem meet; and that the said James JVatty his Executors, Administrators, and Assigns, {hall and lawfully

crowing, accruing, and arising, by reason of these his said Inventions, for the said Term of twenty-five

Years, to have, hold, receive and enjoy the fame, for and during and to the full End and Term of twenty-

five Years, as aforesaid; and that no other Person or Persons within the Kingdom of Great Britain, or

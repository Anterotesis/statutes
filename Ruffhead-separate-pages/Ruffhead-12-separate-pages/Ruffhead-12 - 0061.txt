CAP. XXI.

An Act for more effectually carrying into Execution certain Proposal?, made by the most

Noble Henry Duke of Buccleughy the most Noble Charles Duke of Queenjberry and Dover,

and others, for redeeming the Annuities granted by the Company of the Bank of Ayr,

in that Part of Great Britain called Scotland, known under the Firm of Douglas, Heron*

and Company.

4 HEREAS the most Noble Henry Duke of Buccleugh, the most Noble Charles Duke of Queens

4 / V berry and Dover, the Right Honourable Patrick Earl of Dumfries, Archibald Douglas of Douglas

4 Esquire, and a considerable Number of other Persons, did, in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven

4 hundred aild sixty-nine, enter into a Partnership, and subscribe a Capital or Stock of one hundred and

4 sixty thousand Pounds, or thereabouts, for carrying on the Business of Banking in that Part of Great

4 Britain called Scotland, under the Firm of Douglas, Heron, and Company, with Intention chiefly of im-

4 proving Manufactures and Agriculture, by accommodating and extending the Credit of the Manufacturers

and Farmers of that Part of the Kingdom: And whereas, by too great an Enlargement of the Credit

4 given to the Manufacturers, Farmers, and others, the Partnership did, in June, one thousand feveiL

4 hundred and seventy -two, come to be in great Want of Money to satisfy the Demands made upon them,

4 owing to the Check given to Credit by the many Bankiuptcies that happened at that Time in different

4 Pans of this Kingdom: And whereas the Copartners in the said Company, in order to raise Money to

4 satisfy the Demands upon, them, and thereby prevent the Bankruptcy of many, which their flopping

4 Payment would necessarily have occasioned, did raise, on granting Annuities for one and two Lives, the

4 Sum of four hundred and fifty thousand Pounds, and upwards, subject to a Power given by the Purchasers.

4 of the said Annuities, by verbal Agreement, for the said Copartners to redeem the said Annuities, by re-

4 paying the Purchase-money originally given for the said Annuities, and one Half-year’s Annuity more* aa

4 a Premium for such Power of Redemption: And whereas the said Copartners, in order to extricate thein

4 Affairs, and to enable them to redeem their said Annuities, did, at a General Meeting, held on the

4 twelfth Day of August, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-three, resolve to discontinue the said

4 Banking Business, and nominated and appointed the Persons following, being twelve of the Copartners,

4 or any three of them, to be a Committee, with Power to do every Thing necessary for managing and

4 winding up the Affairs of the Partnership that could be done by the Resolutions of a General Meeting;

4 videlicet, The said Henry Duke of Bucctcugb, the said Charles Duke of Queenfberry and Dover, Archibald

4 Douglas of Douglas, John Hamilton of Sundrum, Alexander Fergufon of Craigdarrocb, Hay Campbell, David

4 Fcrgufon, Alexander Wight, John Campbell, Andrew Crosbie, George Home, and Alexander Mackonochie,

4 Enquires: And whereas, at another Meeting of the said Copartners, held on the twenty-first Day of

4 December, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-three, the Persons following were added to the

4 said Committee, videlicet, Thomas Lockhart, Esquire, Commissioner of Excise, and John Syme Writer to

the Signet, and any five of the said Committee were declared to be a Quorum, for executing all Business

4 And whereas the said Committee, after much Consideration of the most proper and effectual Method of

4 redeeming the said Annuities, finding it was impnffible to raise any considerable Sum for that Purpose

4 out of the Funds of the Partnership, without bringing great Distress upon their Debtors, and injuring

the Credit of that Part of the Kingdom where they chiefly resided, did call a Meeting of the Annuitants

4 together, on the ninth Day of February, one thousand seven hundred and (eventy-four, and deliver ta

4 them, in Writing, the following Proposals: First, That his Grace the Duke of Buccleugh, the Duke

4 of Queenfherry, Archibald Douglas Esquire, and others, being the present Committee, chosen and

4 appointed by a General Meeting of Proprietors at Edinburgh, to manage the Affairs of the said Messieurs

4 Douglas, Heron, and Company, do execute Bonds of fifty rounds each, some few broken Sums excepted^

4 to the Amount of the original Sums paid for the said Annuities, with the Addition of half a Year’s Pur-

4 chafe, or fifty Pounds more, on every Annuity of one hundred Pounds, and pro rata for every greater or

4 ltfl'er Annuity, the said Committee binding themselves, and their Heirs ana Executors, and having a

4 Power to hind all the Partners of the said Company, and their Heirs and Executors, to the due Perform-

4 ance of the Obligations in the said Bonds: Second, That the said Bonds of fifty Pounds each, carrying

4 an lute rest of five Pounds per hundred Pounds, be made payable to a Person named, his Executors,

4 Administrators, or Assigns, by Indorsement, and rendered to all Intents and Purposes negotiable and

4 vendable, like East India Bonds, Navy, and Exchequer Bills, or any Eftefts of a similar Nature:.

4 Third, That as the Principal of the said Bonds, the Premium of Redemption included, is estimated

nearly at four hundred and eighty thousand Pounds, the Interest at five per Centum thereon is twenty-

4 four thousand Pounds per Annum, it is further propofi d, that specifick Estates in Land unentailed in

4 Scotland, to the dear Amount in Rent of thirty-two thousand Pounds per Annum, or upwards, be sub-

jested, by Mortgage, as a corroborative Security for the Discharge of the Principal and Interest of the

4 said Bonds \ that is to say. Of the Interest every Half-year in London; and of the Principal by four

4 luilalmenty vide licet y One fourth Part, as nearly as the Whole tnay be conveniently divided, at Mid-

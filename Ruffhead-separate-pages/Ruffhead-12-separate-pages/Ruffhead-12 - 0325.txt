C. 31. Anno decimo quinto Georgii III. A.D. 1775,

would have been subject and liable to if this Act had not been made, any Thing herein before contained

to the contrary notwithstanding.

4 IX. And whereas by an Act, made in the twenty-fifth Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second

4 (intituled, An Act for the Encouragement of the Greenland and Eastland Tradcs, and for the better securing

the Plantation Trade), and by other Acts of Parliament, it is lawful for any Person or Persons to import

4 into England Train 0:1 or Blubber of Greenland, and Parts adjacent, and those Seas, or of Newfound-

4 land, or of any other his Majesty’s Colonies and Plantations, made of Fish, or of any other Creature

4 living in the Seas, and Whale Fins caught in any Ships or Vessels truly and properly belonging to Eng~

4 land ox IPales, or Town of Berwick upon Tweedy and imported in such Ships, without paying any Cui-

4 tom or Duty for the fame, which Liberty, by a subsequent Act of Parliament, is extended to Ships be-

4 longing to Great Britain $ and it is reasonable that the fame Indulgence (bould be extended to Oil and

4 Blubber of Fish, and other Creatures living in the Sea, and to Whale Fins caught in any Part of the

4 Ocean by Ships belonging to Great Britain, Ireland, and the Islands of Guernsey, Jersey, and Man ;*

be it therefore enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That from and after the first Day of September, one

thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, the Liberty granted by the said Act to import into this King-

dom Oil or Blubber of Fifti, or other Creatures living in the Sea, or Whale Fins taken within the Limits

therein mentioned, Duty-free, shall extend, and be construed to extend, to such Oil or Blubber, or

Whale Fins, as shall be so taken in any Part of the Ocean by, and imported in any Ship or Vessel truly

and properly belonging to, his Majesty’s Subjects of Great Britain, Inland, or the Islands of Guernsey%

Jersey, or Many any Law, Custom, or Usage, to the contrary notwithstanding.

X. And it is hereby further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That from and after the first Day of

September, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, it shall and may be lawful for any Person or Per-

fons to import into this Kingdom any raw and undressed Seal Skins taken and caught by the Crews of

Vessels belonging to and fitted out either from Great Britain, Ireland, or the Islands of Guernsey, Jersey, or

Man respectively, and whereof the Captain or Master and Three-fourths af the lead of the Mariners arc

his Majesty’s Subjects, or by Persons employed by the Matters or Owners of such Vessels, without pay-

ing any Custom, Subsidy, or other Duty, for the fame, any Law or Usage to the contrary notwith-

(lauding.

XI. Provided always. That nothing in this Act shall extend, or be construed to extend, to give Liberty

of importing any such Seal Skins Duty-free, unless the CaDtain or Person having the Charge or Com-

mand of such Ship or Vessel importing the fame shall make Oath before the Collector or other Principal

Officer of the Customs at the Port of Importation (who is hereby authorised and required to administer

such Oath), that all the Skins imported in such Ship or Vessel were really and bona fide the Skins of Seals

taken and caught by the Crews thereof, or by Persons employed by the Master or Owner of such Ship or

Vessel, or of some other Ship or Vessel qualified as aforesaid j and such Seal Skins shall be also duly entered

at the Customhouse for the said Port, and landed in the Presence of the proper Officer or Officers of the

Customs appointed for that Purpose; and on Failure of any of these Conditions, such Skins shall be liable

to pay the fame Duties as they would have been subject and liable to if this Act had not been made, any

Thing herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding

4 XII. And whereas it has been a Practice of late Years for divers Persons to seduce the Fishermen,

4 Sailors, Artificers,* and others, employed in carrying on the Fishery, arriving at Newfoundland, on

4 Board Fiftiing and other Vessels from Great Britain, and the British Dominions in Europe y^ to go from

4 thence to the Continent of Americay to the great Detriment of the Fishery and the Naval Force of this

4 Kingdom :* Now, in order to remedy the said Evil, and to secure the Return of the said Fishermen,

Sailors, Artificers, and others, employed as aforesaid, to the British Dominions in Europe, be it further

enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That from and after the first Day of January, one thousand seven hun-

dred and seventy-six, it shall not be lawful for the Master, or Person having the Charge or Command of

any Ship or Vessel trading to or from any Place within the Government of NewfGundlandy to carry or con-

vey, as Passengers, any such Fishermen, Sailors, Artificers, and^ others, employed as aforesaid, from

thence to any Part of the Continent of Americay without the Permission under the Hand and Seal of the

Governor of the said Island of Neufoundlandy under the Penalty of forfeiting two hundred Pounds for every

such Offence.

4 XIII. And whereas in several Acts, passed in the eleventh and twelfth Years of William the Third,

the eighth of George the First, and second and twelfth of George the Second, Provision has been made to

4 prevent Seamen and Mariners in the Merchant Service being wilfully left beyond Sea, and to secure

and provide for their Return home to such Part of his Majesty’s Dominions where to they belong: And

4 whereas, for want of such Provisions being extended to Seamen and Fishermen going out as Passengers

4 to Newfoundland^ and hired and employed in the Fisheries carried on there, great Numbers of them

4 remain in that Country at the End of every Fishing Season, who would otherwise return home, and

4 some of them have frequently turned Robbers and Pirates j* for Remedy of which Evil, be it enacted

by the Authority aforesaid, That no Person or Persons whatsoever shall, from and after the first Day of

January, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-six, employ, or cause to be employed, at Newfoundland,

for the Purpose of carrying on the Fishery there, any Seaman or Fiflierman going as Passengers, or any

Seaman or Fisherman hired there, without first entering into an Agreement or Contract in Writing with

every such Seaman or Fiflierman, declaring what Wages such Seaman or Filberman is to have, and the

Time for which he shall serve, which shall be signed by both Parties; wherein it shall be stipulated

(amongst other Things) that the Person so hiring or employing shall be at Liberty to reserve, retain, and

deduct, and he is hereby authorised, required, and directed, to reserve, retain, and deduct, out of the

Wnges of every Person so hired or employed, a Sum of Money equal to the then current Price of a Man's

Passage home, not exceeding forty Shillings for each Man, which Money such Hirer or Employer shall,

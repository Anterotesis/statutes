4 XI7 HERE AS by an Act passed in the twenty-fourth Year of the Reign of his late Majesty

* VV (intituled, An Act for the better carrying on and regulating the Navigation of the Rivers Thames

* and Ifis9from the City of London fVeftward> to the Town of Cricklade, in the County <fWilts), the Com-

4 missioners thereby appointed were, amongst other Things, impowered to make Orders and Regula-

* tions touching the Sizes and Draughts of Water of all Boats, Barges, and other Vessels, navigating the

4 said Rivers, and to settle proper Gauges on the Sides thereof, and how deep they should load at alt

4 Times, and in different Seasons of the Year, so as no Boat, Barge, or other Vessel, navigating the said

4 Rivers, should draw more than four Feet of Water at any Season of the Year: And whereas by another

4 Act, patted* in the eleventh Year of his present Majesty, for improving and completing the said Naviga-

tion, the Commissioners thereby appointed were also (amongst other Things) impowered to make

* Orders and Regulations touching the Sizes and Draughts of all Boats, Barges, and other Vessels, navi-

4 gating the said Rivers, and to settle proper Gauges on the Sides thereof,^ and how deep they should load

4 at all Times, so as no Boat, Barge, or other Vessel whatsoever, navigating the said River, should draw

4 more than three Feet of Water, which Depth should be ascertained by a straight white Line one Inch

4 broad, extending from Head to Stern, on each Side of every Barge, Boat, or Vessel; and every Person

4 offending therein, by navigating his Boat, Barge, or Vessel, drawing more than three Feet of Water,

4 or not having the said white Line on each Side thereof, is thereby made liable to a Penalty or Forfeiture,

4 not more than twenty Pounds, nor less than five Pounds, to be levied and recovered in Manner therein

4 mentioned: And whereas the said Restrictions, touching the Depth of Water to be drawn by Boats,

4 Barges, arid other Vessels, navigated upon the said Rivers, have befcn found to be very prejudicial to the

4 Carriage of the Goods,. Wares, and Merchandises navigated thereon: And whereas {he white Lines

4 before mentioned are frequently worn out or rubbed off by unavoidable Accidents, whereby innocent

* Persons become liable to the said Penalty, and the Depth of Water would be better ascertained by Pieces

4 of Tin, Lead, or other Metal, to be affixed in different Places on each Side of such Boats, Barges,

4 and other Veflelsmay it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted ; and be it enacted by

the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Tem-

poral, and Commons, in this prefenjt Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same. That no

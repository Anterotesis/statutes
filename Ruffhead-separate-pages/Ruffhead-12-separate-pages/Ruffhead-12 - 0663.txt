CAP. LXII.

An Act to enable the Commissioners of Sewers for several Limits in the Eastern Parts of the

County of Kent, more effectually to drain and improve the Lands and Grounds within the

General Vallies.

€ II 7 HEREAS there are in the Vallies from Fordwich-bridge to Sandwich-haven, in the County of

Kent (commonly called The General Vallies), upwards of seven thousand Acres of valuable and

4 improveable Arable Lands, Marsh Lands, Meadow Lands, and Low Grounds, within the Limits of the

4 Commission of Sewers herein after mentioned; and, although considerable Sums of Money have for

4 several Years past been annually raised and expended in draining the said Lands and Grounds, they are

4 frequently overflowed: And whereas, if the Commissioners of Sewers for the Time being for the several

4 Limits herein after particularly described, in the Eastern Parts of the said County of Kent, were im-

4 powered to make a proper Cut or Drain from the River Stour, at or near the Salt-works at Stonar, into

4 Sandwich-haven, the Lands within the said General Vallies would be much better and more effectually

4 drained, and at less Expence, than they have been for several Years past: And whereas the Commis-

4 sioners of Sewers for the said Limits are willing and desirous to make the said Cut or Drain, and such

4 other Works as shall be necessary for the better and more effectual draining the Lands and Grounds

within the said General Vallies; but Doubts have arisen whether they have sufficient Powers, by the

4 Laws now in being relating to Sewers, to effeCfc the fame: And whereas the draining of the said Lands

and Grounds will not only be of great Benefit to the Owners and Occupiers thereof^ but also bf public

4 Utility ;9 may it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s

most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and

Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same. That the Com-

missioners of Sewers for the Time being, for the several Limits between Merjham, Ashford, Chart, and

Canterbury, and between Canterbury, Fordwich, Chijlett, Reculver, and the Town and Port of Sandv/tch,

and the Liberties thereof, and within the whole Isle 6fThanct, and within the whole Lath of Saint Aujlin’s,

and between Deal, Eaflry, IVingham, and Sandwich, and between HernehilU IVhifl able, and Seafalter,

and in the Borders or Confines of the fame, and in Merjham, Ashford, Chart, City or Canterbury, and the

Liberties thereof, and in Sandwich and in the Liberties thereof, and in Gravency and Hernehill aforesaid,

and in Brokejbridge and Fordjborne, in the Eastern Parts of the County of Kent, or in the Borders or Con-

fines of the fame, shall, and they are hereby authorised and impowered to make a Cut or Drain at or near

the Salt-works at Stonar, in the said County of Kent, from the River Stour aforesaid, into Sandwich-haven,

of such Dimensions as they shall think fit; and from Time to Time to cleanse, scour, widen, deepen,

alter, maintain, and support the fame in such Manner as they shall think proper, so that the said Cut or

Drain shall never exceed forty Feet in Width; and also to make, raise, maintain, and support, such fuf-

ficient and proper Banks, and all such other Works on the Sides of the said Cut or Drain, as they shall

think necessary; and to make proper and convenient Floodgates within the said Cut or Drain (each Flood-

fate not to exceed four Feet fix Inches in Width); artd the said Commissioners of Sewers shall have full

*ower and Authority over all and Angular the said Works to be made, raised, erected, and set up, by

virtue of this Act; and shall and may from Time to Time alter, remove, repair, rebuild, enlarge, widen,

deepen, scour, and cleanse the fame, paying to such Person or Persons, Body or Bodies Corporate, Po-

litic, or Collegiate, as shall or may have a Right or Property in or to any Lands or Grounds through which

the intended Cut or Drain shall be made, or from which any Earth shall be dug or taken, or through or

upon which any such Banks and other Works as aforesaid shall be made, raised, erected, built, or set up,

his, her, or their Guardian, Trustee, or Committee, or any Person or Persons claiming in his, her, or

their Right, such Sum or Sums of Money for the Damages they shall respectively sustain thereby, as shall

be ascertained and fixed by the said Commissioners of Sewers, who have full Power and Authority to afeer-

tain and fix such the Amount thereof, notwithstanding their being Owners or Occupiers of Lands or

Estates lying within the said General Vallies: And in case the said Commissioners of Sewers and such

Owners or Proprietors cannot agree touching such Recompence and Compensation, the said Commis-

(ioners shall and are hereby required to cause a Jury of the County of Kent to be summoned to ascertain

and fix the Money to be paid for the Lands and Premises so made use of for making the said Cut or Drain

or other Works as aforesaid; and in case the Jury give a Verdict for the fame, or fora less Sum than was

offered by the said Commissioners of Sewers, the Owner or Proprietor of such Lands or Premises as afore-

said shall bear all the Expences attending the Jury; but if a Verdict shall be given for 3 greater Sum than

was offered by the said Commissioners of Sewers to such Owner or Proprietor as aforesaid, then the said

Commissioners of Sewers shall bear all the Expences attending such Jury, any Thing in this Act to the

contrary hereof notwithstanding; and that the said Commissioners of Sewers shall not proceed in such

Works until such Money so ascertained by the Co.mmissioners, or in case the Proprietors of such Lands

(lull refuse to accept the fame, then such Sum as shall be ascertained and settled by the said Jury, shall be

fully paid and satisfieJ, or legally tendered in Payment and Satisfaction unto such Owner or Owners,

Proprietor or Proprieiors, as aforesaid.

Sandwich-haven, as aforesaid, or any other Works to be by them made and erected at or near the said in-

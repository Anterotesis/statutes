4 tribute greatly to the Improvement of the said Kingdom, Colonies, and Plantations: And whereas it

c has frequently been found convenient to execute such'Mortgages or Securities, and the Transfers or

4 Assignments thereof, in Great Britain: And whereas Doubts have arisen, whether such Loans, and the

4 Mortgages or Securities for the fame, and the Transfers or Assignments thereof, when made and exe-

c cuted in Great Britain, are as valid and effectual as when made and executed in the said Kingdom of

4 IrelandColonies, Plantations, or Dominions; and, by reason of an Act, passed in the twelfth Year of

4 Prejudice to Parliamentary Securities, whether such Mortgages or Securities are valid and eJfectual where

the Rate of Interest thereby reserved or made payable is more than five Pounds per Centum, though

4 such Interest does not exceed the Rate of Interest allowed and established by the Law of the Kingdom

4 of Ireland, Colony, Plantation, Country, or Place, in which the Estates comprised in such Mortgages

4 or Securities respecrively are j and whether his Majesty’s Subjefls in Great Britain havenot, or may

4 not, become subject or liable to Penalties or Forfeitures by receiving or taking Interest for the Sums

4 of Money really and horn fide advanced or lent oiv such-Mortgages or Securities, at the Rate of Interest

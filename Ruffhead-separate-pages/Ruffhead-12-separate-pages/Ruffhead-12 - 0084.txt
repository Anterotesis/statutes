A.D. 1774. Anno eJecimo quarto Georgii III. C. 35- 73

4 Year one thousand seven hundred and seventy two, certified, amongst other Things, to the Lords

4 Commissioners of the Treasury, That, by the Matter's Report in the aforesaid* Cause,. dated the twenty-

4 sixth Day of Juney one thousand seven hundred and seventy, it appeared there was then due to Bybye

4 Lake Esquire, the legal Representative of the said Sir Bybye Lake Baronet, on his said Mortgages on the

4 said Mafon9s Estate in Montgomery and Shropshire, for Principal, Interest* andCofts, thirty-eight thousand

4 four hundred and twenty-one Pounds two Shillings and Four-pence; and which, by the said Report

4 was appointed to he paid to the said Bybye Lake on the fourth Day of July then next ensuing, and which

4 it was reprefenied to the said Solicitor had not been paid; and the said Solicitor further certified to the

4 said-Lords Commissioners, That it also appeared, by an Account of the Receiver of the said mortgaged

4 Premises passed in the Court of Chancery for one Year, ending at Lady-Jay one thousand seven hundred

and sixty^eight, that the yearly Value of the said mortgaged Premises in Montgomery and Shropshire is

4 only one thousand one hundred and four Pounds fifteen Shillings and Ten-pence; he therefore sub-

muted to the said Lords Commissioners Confutation, that, under the Circumstances of the Cale, and

particularly in regard to the said mortgaged Premises, if fold, would not fell for nearly the Sum reported

4 due to the said By bye Lake on the twenty-sixth Day o fjune% one thousand seven hundred and seventy, the

4 Claim the Crown has thereon, under the said Decree in one thousand seven hundred and thirteen, could

4 never be satisfied; and therefore the said Solicitor was of Opinion, that if their Lordships should think

4 fit, they might properly consent to the said Estates being discharged from the Debt due to the Crown ;

4 but as it appeared, from the Decree and Proceedings in the said Cause in Chancery, that the Solicitor

4 of the Taxes had had the foie Management of the Crown's Interest in this Matter, he submitted it to their

4 Lordships, whether it would not be proper to direct the Matter to be laid before the Solicitor of the

4 Tax Office, who, from the Papers in his Custody, could exaflly ascertain what the Crown Debt really

4 amounted to, and who would be better able to advise their Lordships whether any, and what, Compo-

4 fition ought to be paid: And whereas the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury referred the said Report

4 of the said Solicitor of the Treasury to Henry IVilmot Esquire, the Solicitor of the Tax Office, who, by

4 his Report, dated the second Day of July, in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and

4 fcvemy-three, did certify to the said Lords Commissioners of his Majesty’s Treasury (amongst other

4 Things), That it appeared to him, by the Books at the Tax Office, that so long ago as the Year one

4 thousand seven hundred and seven, or one thousand seven hundred and eight, George Dixon9 the then

4 Receiver/or the County of Somerset, failed, indebted to her late Majesty Queen Anne in the Sum of

4 twenty-two thousand four hundred and twenty-two Pounds and six Shillings, which, by the said Books,

4 appeared to be still due; and that the before-mentioned Newells were the Securities for the said Dixon;

and it also appeared to him, by the Answer of the Attorney General, as stated in the before-mentioned

4 Decree of one thousand seven hundred and thirteen, that an Extent ittued against the said Netvellsy

and upon an Inquifuion taken thereon upon the thirteenth Day of December, in the sixth Year of the

4 Reign of Queen Anne9 Charles Mason was found to be indebted to the said Newells in the several Sums

4 of three thousand five hundred Pounds, and four thousand Pounds, being so much paid by them for the

1 Use of the said Mafony which Debts were seized into her Majesty’s Hands; and the said Solicitor of the

4 Taxes did further certify to their Lordships, That the Fads stated in rhe'Report of the said Solicitor of

the Treasury, with regard to the Debt due to the aforesaid Matter Lake therein mentioned, and with!

4 regard to the annual Value of the said mortgaged Premises, are truly stated; wherefore the said Solicitor

4 of the Taxes was of Opinion, That the Interest of the Mortgage to the said Matter Lake (whose Debt

4 was prior to that of the Crown}, greatly exceeded the whole Income of the mortgaged Estate, and, of

4 consequence, that the said Matter Lake's Debt did annually increase; and that he was also of Opinion,

4 That the Debt due to the said Matter Lake much exceeded the intrinsick Value of the mortgaged Estate ;

and the said Solicitor of the Taxes did further inform their said Lordships, That Lord Clivey having, for

4 a small Sum of Money, obtained a Conveyance of the Equity of Redemption of the said mortgaged

4 Premises from the Heir at Law of the said Charles Mafony redeemed Lord CatherloMgh, the Assignee of the

4 said Matter Lake the Mortgagee, afterwards sold to, or exchanged with, the Petitioner, the Earl of

4 Powisy the said mortgaged Premises, or some considerable Part thereof; but that, as the Conveyance

4 obtained by the said Lord Clive from the Heir, at Law of Mafony could not bar the Crown, therefore it

4 was of Consequence to the Petitioner the Earl of Poivis ana to Lord Clive (if any Part of the raort-

4 gaged Estate remained in him), to get rid of the Debt due to the Crown, to establish their respective

4 Titles to the said mortgaged Premises; and that, upon the Whole, as the Debt due to the said Master

4 Lake appeared to him greatly to exceed the real Value of the said mortgaged Estate, and as that Debt

4 would always be prior to that of the Crown, and might be set up by the Earl of Poivis and Lord Clive

4 against the Crown Debt; and as the Rents of the said Estate would not nearly pay the Interest of

that Debt, which confeauently would annually increase; and as it would not, in the said Solicitor’s

4 Opinion, be at all advisable for the Crown to redeem the said Mortgage; he thought it might be pro-

4 per for their Lordships to permit the Petitioner, the said Earl of Powisy to apply to Parliament, to en-

able their Lordships to compound the Debt due to the Crown, and after such Aii should be obtained,

4 their Lordships might compound the said Debt at such Sum of Money, as, under all the Circumstances of

the Cafe, their Lordships should think reasonable; but he was of Opinion their Lordships could not,

4 compound the fame without the Aid of Parliament: And whereas the said Henry Arthur^ Earl of Powisy

4 is dead, leaving the Right Honourable George Edward Henry Arthury now Earl of Powis% his only Son

and Heir, who is an Infant, and the Right Honourable Barbara Countess Dowager of Powis9 the Mo-

4 ther, and one of the Guardians, appointed by the Will of the said Henry Arthur Earl of Powis9 of the

4 said George Edward Henry Arthur Earl of Powisy the Infant, hath, since the Decease of the said late Earl*

4 her Hu (band, applied to the Lords Commissioners of his Majesty’s Treasury in Behalf of her said Son, ti

4 compound the said Debt to the Crown,v affecting the said Estates late of the said Charles Mafony which

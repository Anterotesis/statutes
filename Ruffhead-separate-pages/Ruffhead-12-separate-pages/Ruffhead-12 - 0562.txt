CAP. XXXIII.

An Act to remove the Danger of Fire amongst the Ships in the Port of Bristol, by prevent-

ing the landing certain Commodities on the present Quays, and for providing a conve-

nient Quay and proper Places for landing and storing the fame; and for regulating the

said Quay, and the Lighters, Boats, and other Vessels carrying Goods for Hire within

the said Port of Bristol*, and for other Purposes therein mentioned.

T 1J HEREAS the Port of Bristol is a Place of great Trade and Commerce, and the Ships and Vessels

€ VV lying at the Quays thereof are by the Efflux of the Tide left dry twice in every twenty-four

4 Hours, whereby they frequently receive Damage: And whereas great Quantities of Timber, Deals,

Staves, Tar, Pitch, Rofm, and Turpentine, have for many Years past been imported into the said Port,

4 particularly in the Summer Months, during which Time it has frequently happened that there has not

4 been Room within a convenient Distance from the said Quays for storing the fame, by reason whereof,

and of the Expence of removing the fame, which on Articles so cumbrous and of such low Value amounts

4 to a great Charge, the Quays have been often through Necessity greatly incumbered, and the Danger of

4 Fire to the Ships in the rort much dreaded: And whereas the Matter, Wardens, and Commonalty, of

the Society of Merchant Venturers of the said City of Brijiol\ have from Time to Time expended very

4 large Sums of Money for the Benefit of the Navigation and Trade of the said Port, and with a View to

4 provide a Remedy for the afore-mentioned Inconveniencies, have purchased certain Docks and Yards in

the Parish of Clifton, in the Courny of Gloucester, adjoining to the River Avon within the said Port, and

4 have, at a very considerable Ex pence, rendered one of the said Docks, now called The Floating-dcek3

4 capable of receiving and floating the largest Ships using the said Port: And whereas the Danger of Fire

4 to the Ships in the said Port and to the City of Bristol would be greatly lcffened, and it would be more

4 beneficial to all Persons using the Trade of the said Port, if the said Floating-dock was enlarged on the

4 North-western Side thereof, and rendered capable of containing a greater Number of Ships than at

4 present, and if a convenient Quay, with proper Storehouses, Warehouses, Sheds, and Yards, were

4 built, crested, made, and laid out, for landing, storing, and laying up, the afore-mentioned Articles of

4 Trade: And whereas the said Society are willing to enlarge the said Floating-dock, and to build such

4 Quay as aforesaid, and to erect and make the several other Works before mentioned; but cannot eflreft

the ft me, and completely remedy the Inconveniencies afore-recited, without the Aid of Parliament*/

may it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excel-

lent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons,

in this present Parliament act'embled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful

for the said Master, Wardens, and Commonalty, of the society of Merchant Venturers of the said City

of Briflcly and they are hereby authorised and impowered ,to enlarge the said Dock called The Floating-dock,

Yards, and Places, for landing, storing, and laying up the said Goods.

II. And be it further enacted, That all the Land and Ground situate on the North-western Side of, and

Provided the Owners of such Goods do first pass a regular Entry thereof, and pay the Custom and other

4 pointed in Manner therein mentioned, or any five or more of them, were authorised and impowered,

4 at their first or any General half-yearly Meeting, yearly and every Year, to assess, rate, tax, and charge,

4 all and every the respective Owner or Owners, Occupier or Occupiers, of all and Angular the Fen Lands

4 with Water; and the several Owners and Proprietors of Lands within the said District are willing that

the fame should be charged with an additional Tax, or Assessment, in order to raise Money for com-

4 pleating the Drainage of the Lands within the said District: And whereas such Tax or Assessment

4 cannot be laid, nor the said Lands effectually drained and preserved, without the'further Aid and

ment of two Shillings per Acre charged on the Lands and Grounds within the said District, and the Money

4 LXIX. And whereas many Bankrupts, having in all Respects strictly conformed themselves to the

4 Directions of the Bankrupt Laws, have, notwithstanding, been unable to obtain their Certificates, and

4 have, on that Account, been discouraged from exerting their Industry in the Pursuit of their several Oc-

4 cupations ; either living in the most unhappy and distrefled Situation at Home, or seeking Relief in so-

4 reign Countries, where they can earn and secure to themselves the Profit of an industrious Application to

4 BuTinefs; some of whom have carried with them the Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce of this

4 Country,-to the great Prejudice thereof: And whereas some Relief given in such particular Cafes, might

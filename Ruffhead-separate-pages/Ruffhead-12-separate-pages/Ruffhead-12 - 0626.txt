4 such Uses, Intents, and Purposes, as fiorn Time to Time, should seem mod pioper and convenient

4 for effectin| and accommodating the Purposes of the said Act: And whereas, by Letters Patent under

4 the Great Seal of Great Britain, bearing Date the tvvcnty-first Day of March one thousand seven hun-

4 dred and seventy-two, his said Majesty did demise, grant, and to farm let, unto the Guardians of the

4 Poor within thtlfe cf Wight, for the Time being, and their Successors, all that Piece or Parcel of

4 feribed in a Plan thereof remaining in the Office of his Majesty’s Surveyor General; to have, hold, and

4 and acting Guardians of the Poor within the said Ife of Wight, from Time to Time chosen and elected

4 together with all other convenient Buildings for the Lodging and Employment of the Poor, as thereby

4 directed, and in carrying into Execution the other Powers thereby to them granted; but find, that by

* reason of the Inefficiency of the Sum of Money they are authorised to borrow for the Purposes of the

4 said Act, (and which they have already taken up and borrowed) and on Account of some Defects there-

4 in, the good Purposes intended by the said Act cannot be completely effected without the further Aid of

4 Parliament: And whereas the Purposes thereby intended might be better effected, if the several Clauses,

4 Powers, and Regulations, for the good Government of the Poor of the said Island, already made and

4 provided by the said Act, and hereby further intended to be made and provided, were reduced into one

4 Law;’ may it therefore plea fe your Majesty that it may be enacted ; and be it enacted by the King’s

most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and

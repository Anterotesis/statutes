4 Kingdom, andGoods pretended to be shipped outwards, intitled to a Drawback or Bounty, are fre-

4 quently not shipped, or after the Shipping thereof relanded, whereby they become liable to several Pe-

4 nalties; but knowing themselves subject to be prosecuted for the said Offences, and that their fraudulent

4 Practices may in Time be discovered, do frequently, before any Discovery can be made by the Officers

4 of the Revenues, cause Informations to be entered and filed against themselves in some of the Courts

4 at Westminster or Edinburghy in the Name of some Person or Persons in his, her, or their Behalf; and

4 if no Discovery be made of the said fraudulent Practices by the Officers of the Revenues, the said In-

4 formations are never prosecuted ; but in case the said Frauds are discovered by any Officer or Officers of

4 the Revenues, who thereupon enter and file real Informations against such Offender and Offenders, then

4 either some secret Agreement or Agreements is or are made by such Offender or Offenders with such Per-

4 son or Persons who have filed or exhibited such Informations on the Behalf of such Offender or Often-

4 ders, or else a Plea or Pleas of Priority of Suit is or are pleaded in bar of such real Informations prose-

4 cuted by the Officers of the Revenues, whereby the said Offenders evade the several Penalties inflicted

4 by Law, to the great Prejudice of the Crown, and also the Discouragement of real Prosecutions : For

4 Prevention of which fraudulent Practices, it is by the said Act enacted, That it shall not be lawful for any

4 Person or Persons whatsoever to enter, or cause or procure to be entered, filed, or prosecuted, any Infor-

4 mation or Informations, in any of the said Courts, against any Person or Persons, for the Recovery of

4 any Penalty or Penalties inflicted by any of the Laws of the Customs, Exrife, and the Duty upon Salt,

* unless the fame be entered, filed, and prosecuted, in the Name of his Majesty’s Attorney General, or in

4 the Name or Names of some Officer or Officers of some or one of the aforesaid Revenues of Customs,

4 Excise, or Salt Duty; and if any Information or Informations is or are entered in any other Persons

4 Name or Names than as is before mentioned, the fame, and all Proceedings thereupon had, are thereby

4 declared to be null and void, and the said Court or Courts, where such Information or Informations is,

4 are, or shall be so entered, filed, or prosecuted, shall not permit or suffer any Proceeding or Proceed-

* ings to be had thereupon, and shall cause such Information or Informations to betaken off the File:

4 by several Acts of Parliament against Persons importing various Goods and Commodities, which are

4 prohibited to be imported into or worn or used in this Kingdom, and against Persons working up such

4 Goods, or felling or exposing the fame to Sale, or for having such Goods in their Houses, Shops, Ware-

4 houses, Custody, or Possession, for those Purposes, one Moiety of which Penalties are given by Law to

4 his Majesty, and the other Moiety to any Person who will sue and prosecute for the fame: And where-

4 as there is reason to believe that several Prosecutions have been commenced for such Penalties by com-

4 mon Informers, who have, in conference thereof, extorted various Sums of Money from his Majesty’s

4 Subjects, and (topped such Prosecutions without any legal Authority, or accounting to his Majesty for

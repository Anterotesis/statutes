for the keeping of foreign Brandy, Arrack, Rum, Spirits, or Strong Waters, no other Seller or Dealer

feitures as Seilers of and Dealers in foreign Brandy, Arrack, Rum, Spirits, and Strong Waters, without

4 III. And, the better to prevent foreign Spirituous Liquors, that have been illegally imported into this

4 Kingdom, from being removed from the Sea Coasts into the Stocks of entered Dealers in those Commo-

* dities, and of others,* be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That, from and alter the said twenty-

ninth Day of Settember^ no Seller of or Dealer in foreign Brandy, Arrack, Rum, Spirits, or Strong Wa-

ters, shall be allowed to takeout more than one Permit in one and the same Day to any one Person what-

one Cask, or other Package, containing any foreign Spirituous Liquors of one Kind or Species; and if any

more than one Cask, or other Package, of foreign Spirituous Liquors of one Kind or Species at one Time,

directed to one and the same Person (or Persons, where there are two or more in joint Trade or Partner-

ship, except as herein-after is excepted), shall be found removed or carried, or removing or carrying,

from one Place in this Kingdom to any other Place, whether with or without Permit, the fame,

together with the Vessels and Boats, and the Horses and other Cattle, and the Carriages employed

in removing or carrying the fame, shall be forfeited, and shall and may be seized by any Officer or.

Officers of Excise.

IV. Provided always, and be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That nothing herein con-

tained shall be construed to prevent any Dealer in foreign Spirituous Liquors from taking out two or

more Permits, and, by virtue thereof, fending two or more Calks, or other Packages, containing

foreign Spirituous Liquors of the fame Kind and Specie*, to the same Person, in the same Day, so as

each and every such Calk or Package respectively shall be sent under different Permits, and by different

Conveyances.

V. Provided also, and be it further enacted, That nothing herein-before contained shall be construed to

prevent any Seller of or Dealer in foreign Spirituous Liquors, from fending with one and the fame Permit,

by one and the fame Conveyance, any Number of Casks with any Kind of Foreign Spirituous Liquors

therein, each such Cask then containing sixty Gallons, or upwards, of foreign Spirituous Liquors of one

and the fame Kind or Specie*.

VI. And be it further ena£led by the Authority aforesaid, That if any foreign Spirituous Liquors (not

being in Casks containing sixty Gallons, or upwards), {bail be found removing or carrying from any one

Part of this Kingdom to any other Part thereof, unless at (nth Tunes as herein-after mentioned ; that is to

say, From the twenty-ninth Day of September to the twenty-fifth Day of Alar cl), yearly, between the

Hours of seven in the Morning and five in the Evening; and from the twenty inch Day of March, to the

twenty-ninth Day of September, yearly, between the Hours of five in the Morning and seven in the Even-

ing (exceptthe fame is carrying determined by a known common Stage Coach, Waggon, or other Srage Carnage,

which usually travels out of those Hours), all the said foreign Spirituous Liquors, and the Package con-

taining the fame, whether the fame be accompanied with or witnout a Permit, and all the Cattle anti Car-

riages made use of in the removing or conveying the fame, shall be forfeited, and shall and may be seized by

any Officer or Officers of Excise.

VII. And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That, fresh and after the said twenty-ninth

Day of September, when any Seller of or Dealer in foreign Spirituous Liquors, shall fend a Request Note to

any Permit Writer, requiring any Permit or Permits lor the Removal of any foreign Spirituous Liquors

from his own Stock into the Stock of any other Person or Persons, every such Seller and Dealer shall, and

he is hereby required and directed to specify, in every such Request Note, as well the Quality or Kind of

foreign Spirituous Liquors, intended to be removed with each Permit, as also the Contents of the Cask or

other Package containing the fame, and Jikewife whether the fame is to be removed by Land or by Water,

and by what Mode of Conveyance the said Cask, Bottle, or other Package respeitively, is intended to be

such Request Note, either the Quality of the Spirituous Liquors intended to be removed, or the Contents of

the Calk, Bottle, or other Package containing the fame; or by what Carriage, or Mode of Conveyance,

the fame is intended to be sent, every such Request Note and Notes shall be null and void; nor shall any

Permit or Permits be granted by any Officer or Permit Writer thereon.

4 VIII. And whereas, for the better fecuw’ng the Duties chargeable upon exciseable Commodities, the

4 Dealers therein are, by several Statutes now in force, required to take out Permits from the proper

4 Officers of Excise, certifying that those Duties have been paid, which Permits are to accompany such

4 Commodities when removing from one Part of this Kingdom to any other Part thereof: And whereas

4 great Frauds have been committed by forging Permits in Imitation of those granted by such Officers, and

4 the Penalties already provided to prevent such Forgeries are not sufficient to suppress so great an Evil;

4 for the more effectual preventing such Practices, so manifestly tending to the Rum of the fair Trader, and

4 to the Diminution of so material a Branch of the Revenue of this Kingdom,’ be it enacted by the Autho-

rity aforesaid, That the respeflive Commissioners of Excise in England and Scotland shall, on or before the

c TWHEREAS his Majesty King Charles the Second, by his Letters Patent, under the Great Seal

4 V f of England^ bearing Date at if ejlthirjler the Second Day of A lay, in the nineteenth Year of his

4 Reign, reciting, That there had been, Time out of Mind, within the Manors of Stcbuuheath alias Ste-

4 hunhith alias Stepney, not only for the said Manor, but al.o for the Manor of llackue\\ in the County of

4 Midcitefex, a curain Court Baron, for the Determination of certain Adioos nal, arising within

4 those Aiamrs, not amounting to the Sum of foity Shillings; and that because the King’s >ufjccts dwell-

4 ing, rifiding, and inhabiting within the Paid Manors, and the Hamlets ami Liberties of the larr.e, Were

4 very numerous, and very many of them indigent Sailors and featuring Men, who for the n oil Part of

4 their Lives were at Sea, and in the King’s Service upon the High Sea, and also wire m:.ny Time* cm-

* ployed in the mcic^mile Affairs of the King's Subjects in Parts beyond the Seas ; and mere fore that it

4 was ripht and lit that the rciibint Inhabitants* meeting, dwelling, contracting, nn ocijting, or being

4 within the fa id Manors, the Hamlets and Liberties of the fame, ibould have speedy Justice in their pei-

4 fonal Ablions, Pleas and Ccrr,pla;m% left peradventure they should be long and muui hindered ftom the

4 King’s beivice, and their other maritime Bufiiufs; therefore did, at the Request of the Right Hcnnur-

4 able Thomas Earl of Clcaveland, and Thomas Lord JVcntworth, vouch fife to cicrt, create, and conthtute

4 a certain Court of Pleas of Record, to be called The Court of the Lord the King of Record, within the

4 Alanors of Sttpnev and Hackney, in the County of Middlesex, the Hamlets and Liberties of the fame \ try

4 beheld on every That flay in every Week throughout the Year (except as therein excepted), for the

4 Determination, before the Steward of the Laid Court for the Time being, or his Deputy (the said Stew*

4 ard, or his Deputy, being Barrifteis of three Years (landing at the Bar at lead), of all and singular

4 Actions, Pleas, and Complaints, personal TrespafLs with Force and Arms, Trespasses on the Cafe*

4 Debts, Accounts, Detinue of Goods and Chattels Deceipis and Contracts, and other Cauies, G>m-

4 plaints, and Pleas personal whatsoever, of any Sum or Damage not amounting to the Sum of one hun-

4 dred Shillings (Pleas de Ejedlionefirm# only excepted), according to the Laws and Customs of England*

4 to hold Pica of the fame, within the said Manors, and the Hamlets and Liberties of the fame, in as

4 ample Manmr and Form as any other Court of Record, by the Laws and Customs of England, of such

4 and the like Pleas, Complaints, or Actions, hath or hold Plea, or might or ought to hold Pk*a ; and

4 granting to Sir Udlliam Smyth Baronet, and his Heirs or Assigns, the Appointment of the said Steward,

4 and the other Officers of the said Court, as by the said Letters Patent, and the Exemplification thereof*

4 inrolled in the High Court of Chancery, and there remaining of Record, Reference being thereunto

4 had, may more fully appear: And whereas the present Method of Proceeding, for the Recovery of Debts

4 in the said Court of Record, is very dilatory, and the Expences attending it lo great, that in most CateS

4 it exceeds the Debt to be recovered : And whereas, if proper Powers were granted for shortening the

4 Proceedings of the said Court, to enable the Creditor to recover his Debt in a more summary Wav, the

4 Expences thereof would be so much reduced, that Numbers of Tradesmen resident within the said

4 Distiicf, who now submit to the Loss of their small Debts, would have the Means of recovering them*

4 without difmlfing the unfortunate Debtor by the present heavy Costs and Law Expences: And whereas

4 it would greatly alleviate the Distrelles of the honest and industrious Debtor, if the Steward of the said

4 Court were enabled to order Payment of the Debt by different Payments, at the Difi retion of the Jury

4 herein-afeer mentioned; which partial Payment it might be possible for the Debtor to make, though ab-

4 foluiely imp dfble for him to pay the whole Debt in one Sum : And wheicas it is also reasonable that

4 there should be a Limitation of Time (or the Imprisonment for Small Debts :* May it therefore please

your Majesty that it may be enabled ; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and

with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this prtfent Par-

liament assembled* and by the Authority of the same, That, from and after the first Day of July, one

thousand leven hundred and eighty-one, it shall and may be lawful for the Steward of the said Court,

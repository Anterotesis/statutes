4 XLIV. And whereas there is but one Common or County Gaol for each of the respective Counties of

4 York, Lincoln, Lancaster, and Durham, which said Counties are each of them divided into several Ridings

4 or Divisions, all which have several Commissions of the Peace; and if the Gaolers of those Gaols be

4 obliged to carry the Debtors, Prisoners therein, to the Quarter Session of each Riding or Division, the

4 fame will be a very great Charge, not only to such Gaolers, but also to the Prisoners, in those large

4 Countiesbe it therefore enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful for two or

more Justices of the Peace for any of the Ridings or Divisions in the respective Counties (or any other

County or Counties where the Prisons are at a Distance from the Place where the Sessions are held), at the

Common or County Gaol thereof respectively, or at some convenient Place near thereto, and they are hereby

required to assemble and meet, and to hold Session there, by Adjournment from their respective Quarter

Session, from Time to Time, for the Discharge of the respective Prisoners therein, according to the

Powers, Limitations, and Directions of this Act.

4 XLV. And whereas the Division or District of Holland in the said County of Lincoln, is distant near

4 forty Miles from the said County Gaol, and it is highly inconvenient and expensive for the Justices of the

4 Peace acting for the said Division, to be obliged to travel to the said Gaol, for the foie rurpose of dif-

4 charging the Prisoners under the Powers by this Act given be it therefore enacted, That, for the

several Purposes aforesaid, the Justices for the said Division or District of Hollatul may adjourn their origi-

nal Sections to the County Gao), or some Place near thereunto; and that it may and shall be lawful for

any two Justices of the Peace, acting either for the Parts of Lindsey, Krjleven, or Holland, to hold such ad-

journed Sessions for the sole Purpose of discharging such Prisoners ; Notice of the Adjournment cf such

original Session being given by the Clerk of Sections to such Justices, and who shall attend there to re-

gifter the Proceedings of the said Court, so far as the fame relate to, or affect the Discharge of any Prisoner

detained for Debt in the Division of Holland, and claiming the Benefit of this Act.

4 XLVI. And whereas the next General Quarter Seifiuns of the Peace for the County of 1Surrey, which

4 shall happen after the passing of this Act, may be in the Country, and upwards of twenty Miles from

4 any of the said Prisonsbe it therefore enabled by the Authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be

lawful for such Justices as shall be assembled at the General Quarter Session of the Pc^ce to be holden for

the County of Surrey, next after the passing of this Act, and they are hereby required forthwith to adjourn

the Ljid Session to the Town-hall in the Borough of Southwark, for the Purpose of administering the Oaths

required to be taken and subscribed by this Act, by the several Gaolers within the said County, and

for the Discharge of Prisoners or other Debtors, according to the Powers, Limitations, and Diiedions of

this Act.

XLVII. And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Debtors and others, who were

in Prison on or before the said first Day of January, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-one, in any

of the Gaols of this Kingdom, and now remain there for not paying their Fees, Rents, or other Demands

due, or claimed as due, to the Keeper or Gaoler of any Prison respectively, or to any other Officer of such

Prison, and upon no other Account, shall bedischarged therefrom, he, (he, or they, taking the Oath by

sped to any Debt or Penalty with which he or she shall stand charged at the Suit of the Crown, or at the Suit

of any Sheriff or other public Officer, upon any Bail Bond entered into for the Appearance of any Person

prosecuted for any Offence committed against any Act or Acts of Parliament relative to his Majesty’s Re-

venues of Customs, Excise, or Salt Duties, or either of them.

4 XLIX. And whereas, under former Acts, Creditors have been put to great Expences and Trouble in

4 attending every Session and Adjournment, during the whole Continuance of the Ad, to oppose the

4 Discharge of Debtors clearly excluded from any Benefit under the said respective Acts, but who, after

4 having been before one Session heard, and refused a Discharge, to harass their Creditors, constantly

4 gave fresh Notices for each subsequent Session and Adjournment of their intended Application to

4 be discharged p to remedy which, be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That in all Cafes

whatever, the Determination of the Justices in Session or Adjournment shall be final to all Intents and

Purposes, unless the Debtor shall, during the Continuance of this Act, get rid of the Objection or Ob-

jedions for which they refused his Discharge ; and, that the fame may be clear and certain, the Justices

are hereby required to (late the Objections why such Debtor’s Discharge is refused by them ; and, in all

Cafes whatever, it shall and may be lawful to and for the Justices, at any subsequent Session or Adjourn-

ment, upon Application from the Prisoner, upon due Proof on Oath made to them, by two or more cre-

dible Witnesses (which Oath they are hereby impowered to administer), of each Objection or Objections

being removed, and on Proof of Notice served, at least ten Days previous to such Application, on the Cre-

ditor or Creditors who before opposed his Discharge, and of Notice likewise inserted in the Gazette, in

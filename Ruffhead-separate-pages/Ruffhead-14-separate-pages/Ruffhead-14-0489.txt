4 imported for other Purposes; whereupon the Proprietors of the said Manufactories paid the Dtites

4 accordingly, but under Protest, that the Right of Exemption claimed by them should not thereby be

* hurt, nor themselves precluded from reclaiming such Duties as alreadyhad been., or afterwards should

* be paid by them; and for bringing the Right of Exemption so claimed by them to Trial, the Pro-

4 prietors of the said Rope Work did, some Time since, cause inititute an Action in the Court of

* Exchequer at Edinburgh, at the Suit of the said Ja?nes Corbet, one of the said Proprietors, and

4 Assignee of the rest of those Proprietors, against Edward Burrow, Collector of the Custom9 at

4 the Port of Port Glasgow, and John Clerk, then the Deputy of the said Edward Burrow, at the

4 Member Port of Greenock, for that they had, against Right, refused to repay Duties levied by*

4 them on certain Materials imported for the Use of the said Rope Work; in the Course of the Pro-

4 ceedings of which Action a Special Verdict was agreed upon and settled by the Parties, and returned

4 by a Jury, upon which Verdict Counsel were heard by the Lord Chief Baron, and other three Barons

* of the said Court, and the Judges being eaually divided in their Opinion, theQuestion remains hitherto

4 undetermined; since the Time of whion Hearing, certain Propositions have been offered by the Pro-

4 prietors of both the said Works, for accommodating the Matter in Dispute: And whereas the Claim

4 of Exemption made by the Proprietors of the said Manufactories would, on the one Hand, if efta-

4 blished, be very prejudicial to the publick Interest, being capable to be exercised in an unlimited Extent

4 with respect to the Commodities which are the Subject thereof, to the great Diminution of the Re-

4 venue, and the Breach of that Equality in Trade which ought to have Place in all Parts of the United

4 Kingdom: And whereas by means of the aforesaid Treaty of Union, and the Doubts and Disputes

4 thereupon arising in relation to the Right of Exemption claimed as aforesaid, as well as by reason of

4 the Proceedings consequent upon such Doubts and Disputes, the Proprietors of the said Rope and Soap

4 Works, who, in firm Reliance of the publick Faith of the Kingdom, had laid out and employed a

4 considerable Sum of Money towards carrying on the said Works, have, on the other Hand, suffered

4 considerable Loss and Inconveniency, the Exemption from the Payment of Duties enjoyed by them un-

4 der the Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, having, by the aforesaid Means, been abridged or interrupted,

4 and much Expence incurred by Law Suits and otherwise : And whereas in a Cafe so circumstanced it is

4 reasonable and just, that some Compensation should be made to the said Proprietors, for the private Loss

4 they have suffered in consequence of the said Treaty of Union, a Transaction calculated for national

4 Advantages: And whereas it is at the fame Time expedient to remove all such Doubts and Disputes as

4 aforesaid in future ;* be it therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Ad-

vice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament af-

sembled, and by the Authority of the same. That all and every the Exemption or Exemptions from the A11 E*emptToai

the Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, or the Acts of the Exchequer and Privy Council of that King - partition of

dom, herein generally or particularly before mentioned, or any of them, shall, in all Cafes whatever, be Good*, granted

deemed and taken to have been intended, not as a private Right in favour of any Person or Persons, *>ythe P»riia-

Companies, or Bodies Politick whatever, but as a publick Encouragement to Trade, limitable by the '

Parliament of Scotland, and determined by the Treaty of Union concluded between these Kingdoms, and the Union. 7

for the several Reasons and causes herein before mentioned.

II. And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every the Conditional Bonds The conditional

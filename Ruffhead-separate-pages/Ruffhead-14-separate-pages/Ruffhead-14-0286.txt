4 WHEREAS notwithstanding the many Laws now in being for the Relief and Employment of the

Poor, and the great Sums of Money raised for those Purposes, their Sufferings and L)iftreffes arc

4 nevertheless very grievous; and, by the Incapacity, Negligence, or Mjfcondudlof Overseers, the Money

4 raised for the Relief of the Poor is frequently misapplied, and sometimes expended in defraying the

c Charges of Litigations about Settlements indiscreetly and unadvifcdly carried on: And whereas, by a

4 Clause in an Act, passed in the ninth Year of the Reign of King George the First, intituled, An Act for

the Amendment of the Laws relating to the Settlement, Employment y and Relief of the Poory Power is giveiv

4 to the Churchwardens and Overseed, in the Manner therein mentioned, to purchase or hire Houses, and

4 contrail with any Person for the Lodging, Keeping, Maintaining, and Employing the Poor, and taking

the Benefit of their Work, Labour, and Service, for their Maintenance; and, where any Parish, Town,

4 or Townftip, (bould be found too small, to unite two or more for those Purposes, with the Consent of

the major Part of the Pariftioners or Inhabitants, and the Approbation of a Justice of Peace; which

4 Provisions, from the Want of proper Regulations and Management in the Poor Houses or Workhouses

that have been purchased or hired under the Authority of the said Act, and for Want of due Inspectioa

and Controul over the Persons who have engaged in those Contracts, have not had thedefired Effect,

4 but the Poor, in many Places, instead of finding Protection and Relief, have been much oppressed

4 thereby :* For Remedy of these Grievances and Inconveniences, and in order 10 make better and more

effectual Provision for the Relief and Employment of the Poor, and to introduce a prudent Oeconomy in the

Expenditure of the Parish Money; may it please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted

by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and

Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That

from and after the twenty-fifth Day of March, which shall be in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven

hundred and eighty-three, so much of the said Clause as respects the maintaining or hiring out the Labour

of the Poor by Contract, within any Parish, Township, or Place, which shall adopt the Provisions of this

Act, shall be, and is hereby repealed, and every Contract or Agreement made in pursuance thereof, for

either of those Purposes, shall become, and is hereby declared to be, null and void.

II. Provided nevertheless, and be it further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Visitor and

Guardian, or Visitors and Guardians, appointed as hereafter mentioned, of any Parish, Township, or

Place, or Parishes, Townships, and Places, which shall have adopted the Provisions, and complied with the

Requisites of this Act, and shall have a Visitor appointed, from Time to Time to make Agreements with

any Person or Persons for the Diet or Cloathing of such poor Persons who shall be sent *o the House or

Houses to be provided under the Authority of this Act, and for the Work and Labour of such poor Persons,

fothat no such Agreement shall be made for any longer Time than twelve Months, and so that the fame

shall be, and every such Agreement is hereby declared to be, under the ftridleit Inspection and Controul of

the Visitor, Guardian, and Governor of such Poor House, and also of the Justices of the Peace for the

Limit where such Poor House shall be; two of which Justices, upon Proof of any Abuse, shall have Power

to dissolve such Contract.

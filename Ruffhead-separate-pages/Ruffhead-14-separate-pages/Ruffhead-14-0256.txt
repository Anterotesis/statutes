{except such Monies of the said Sinking Fund as are appropiated to any particular Use or Uses by any

former Act or Acts of Parliament in that Behalf); and such Monies of the said Sinkinjg Fund shall and

may be, from Time to Time, issued and applied accordingly: And if, at any Time or Times, before any

Monies of the said Fund, to be established as aforesaid, (nail be brought into the Exchequer as aforesaid,

there shall happen to be a Want of Money for paying the several Annuities as aforesaid, which shall be ac-

tually incurred and grown due at any of the half-yearly Days of Payment before mentioned, that then,

and in every fechCafe, the Money so wanted shall and may be supplied out of the Monies of the Sinking

Fund (except as before excepted), and be issued accordingly

XIX. Provided always, and be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That whatever Monies shall be

issued out of the said Sinking Fund {hall, from Time to Time, be replaced by and out of the first Supplies

to be then after granted in Parliament.

XX. Provided always, and be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That in case there shall beany Sur-

plus or Remainder of the Monies arising by the said Fund, after the said several and respective Annuities and

all Arrears thereof, are satisfied, or Money sufficient {hall be reserved for that Purpose, such Surplus or Re-

but by the Authority of Parliament, and as shall be directed by future Act or Acts of Parliament; any

4 XXI. And whereas by an Act, made in the last Session of Parliament, intituled, An Act for repealing

the Duties payable ubon Chocolate made in Great Britain, and for granting certain Inland Duties upon Cocoa

4 Nuts in Lieu thereof; for the better and more effectual securing the Revenue of Excise, and of the Inland Du-

4 ties under the Management of the Commissioners of Excise, and for preventing Frauds therein; for the more

*4 punctual and ready Payment of the Allowances to be made to Brewers out of the additional Duties imposed on

4 Malt \ and for rectifying a Mi flake in an Act made in this present Session of Parliament, with respect to the

4 exempting of Candles from the additional Duty of five Pounds per Centum upon the Duties of Excise impojei

4 by the /aidAft; it was, amongst other Things enacted. That, for the preventing of smuggled Tea betng

4 being conveyed from the Sea Coasts of this Kingdom into the Stocks of Dealers in Tea, no Teaex-

4 ceeding the Quantity of six Pounds Weight should at any Time, save as therein is after mentioned, be

4 removed or carried from any Part of this Kingdom, not being within the Limits of the weekly Bills of

4 Mortality, or of the Chief Office of Excise in London, to any Place within the said Limits: And whereas

the suffering Tea to be brought from the Country into London in Quantities not exceeding six Pounds

4 Weight, hath in a great Measure defeated the good Effects proposed by the said recited Act, and great

4 Quantities of smuggled Tea have thereby been received into the Stocks of fraudulent Tea Dealers, living

4 within the Limits aforesaid s* Now, for the more effectually preventing such evil Practices, be it enacted

by the Authority aforesaid, That, from and after the first Day of August, one thousand seven hundred and

eighty-two, no Tea whatever {hall at any Time (save as herein-after is mentioned) be removed or carried

from any Part of this Kingdom, not being within the Limits of the weekly Bills of Mortality, or of the

Chief Office of Excise in London, to any Place within the said Limits; and if any Tea whatever shall be

found so removed or carried, or removing or carrying, whether with or without Permit (save as herein-

after is mentioned), the fame, together with the Canifters, Bags, and other Package, containing such Tea,

and the Vessels and Boats, and the Horses, and other Cattle and Carriages, employed in removing the

fame, shall be forfeited, and shall and may be seized by any Officer or Officers of Excise; any Thing in

the said recited Act to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.

4 XXII. And whereas by the said recited Act it was further enacted, That no Tea exceeding the Quan-

4 tity of forty Pounds Weight (save as therein is excepted) at any one Time, directed to one and the fame

4 Person, or Persons where there are two or more in joint Trade or Partnership, {hould be removed or car-

4 tied from any City, Town, Parish, or Place, in this Kingdom, not being within the Limits aforesaid,

4 to any other Place out of the Limits aforesaid, not within the said City, Town, Parish, or Place, from

4 which the fame shall be so removed or carried; and it was by the fame Act provided, that nothing therein

4 contained should be construed to prevent any Dealer in any such City, Town, Parish, or Place, from

4 taking out two or more Permits, and by virtue thereof fending two or more Packages of forty Pounds

4 each to the same Person in the same Day, in Manner therein directed and provided: And whereas the'

4 permitting Tea to be sent from Places not being within the Limits of the weekly Bills of Mortality, or of

the Chief Office of Excise in London, in so large Quantities as forty Pounds Weight, has been much

4 abused by fraudulent Dealers in T ea, and very confulerable Quantities of smuggled Tea have thereby

4 been received by such Dealers, from the Coasts of this Kingdom, to the manifest Diminution of the

4 Revenue, and to the Injury of the fair Trader f Now, for obviating such Frauds, be it further enacted

by the Authority aforesaid, That, from and after the said first Day of August, one thousand seven hundred

and eighty-two, no Tea exceeding the Quantity of twenty Pounds Weight (not being in the original

Chest in which the fame Tea was imported into this Kingdom by the United Company of Merchants of

England trading to the East Indies, and then continuing in the fame State in,which it was so.imported), at

Term to his Majesty’s Court of King's Bench at JVcflminster* on the Oath of the Person or Persons making

the fame; such Oath to be made before the said Court, or any Commissioner authorised to take Affidavits

in the fame.

4 IX. And whereas there are several Persons confined in County and City Gaols in England and Wales%

4 under Sentences and Orders made by a Justice or Justices of Peace at their Sessions, or otherwise, in a

4 summary Way, and not according to the Course of the Common Law be it further enacted, That it

shall and may be lawful for any Justice of Assize or Great Session, or any two or more Justices of the

Peace within whose Jurisdiction the said Gaol is situate, to remove any such Person or Persons to any

House of Correction within the said Jurisdiction, there to remain in Execution of the said Sentence or

Order.

4 X. And whereas the Security required by an Act, passed in the fourth Year of the Reign of his late

4 Majesty King George the First (intituled, An Act for the further preventing Robbery* Burglary* and other

4 Felonies* and/or the more effectual Transportation of Felons* and uniauful Exporters of Wool; and for ie*

4 daring the Law upon some Points relating to Pirates), relates only to the Transportation of Offenders to

c his Majesty’s Colonies and Plantations in America: And whereas an Ac!, passed in the nineteenth Year

4 of his present Majesty (intituled, An Ac7 to explain and amend the Laws relating to the Transportation, Im~

4 prisonment* and other Punishment* of certain Offenders)* hath not provided any Security to be taken instead

* thereof ;’ be it enacted, That it mall and may be lawful for any Court, having competent Authority to

order the Transportation of Offenders, or any Person or Persons duly authorised for that Purpose, to

require and take, from any Person or Persons who shall be willing tojeontrad or agree for the Transport-

ation of any Offender or Offendets, sufficient Security that he or they will transpoit, or cause to be trans-

ported effectually, such Offender or Offenders to the Place to which he, (he, or they, is, are, or shall be

ordered to be transported ; and that the said Offenders, or any of them, shall not be suffered to return from

the said Place to any Part of Great Britain* by the wilful Default of such Person or Persons so contracting

as aforesaid, or his or their Alliens; and instead of the Certificate required by the said Act of the fourth

Year of the Reign of his late Majriiy King George the First, to take Security for the Production of such

other Evidence of the aCtual Transportation of such Offender or Offenders as shall appear necessary, and

as the Nature of the Cafe may warrant.

4 XI. And whereas the Provisions of the said Act, passed in the nineteenth Year of the Reign of his

4 present Majesty (intituled, An Act to explain and amend the Laws' relating to the Transportation, ImPrifon-

4 merits and other Punishment of certain Offenders)* are not sufficient to obviate the Difficulties which have

4 arisen in carrying into Execution Sentences and Orders for Transportation of Felons, and others now

4 under Confinement: And whereas, in order to facilitate the Transportation of such Felons, and others,

4 it is necessary that Authority should be given to transport them to any proper Place beyond the Seas,

4 although the said Place be not mentioned in the Sentence or Order for their TransportationBeit

enacted, That if any Offender hath already been ordered to be transported to any Part beyond the Seas

or if hereafter any Offender shall be under the like Order, and such Order cannot be conveniently executed

with respect to the Place in such Order mentioned, it shall and may be lawful for the Court of King's

Bench, or for the Court before which any such Person hath been or shall be convicted, or any Court

holden for the same County, City, Riding, Liberty, Division, or Place, having like Authority; or whilst

the Court of King's Bench is not fitting, for any two Justices of the Court of King's Bench, Common Pleas,

or Barons of the Exchequer* of the Degree of the Coif, if such Court, or such two Justices or Barons, shall

think fit, to order that such Offender shall be transported to any other Part beyond the Seas, which shall

appear to such Court proper for that Purpose, in such and the like Manner, and for the fame Term of

Years, as such Offender is or shall be liable to be transported to the Place mentioned in the original Sen-

tence or Order for his or her Transportation ; and such Order shall be considered as made at the fame

Time, and shall be as effectual to every Intent and Purpose, and shall have all the fame Consequences in

every Respect, as the original Order for the Transportation of such Offender ; and such Offender shall be

transferred, conveyed, and nude over to any Person who will contract for the Performance of such Trans-

portation, and to his or their Atiigns, in like Manner as if such Offender had been transported to the Place

mentioned in the original Order of Transportation; and such Person or Persons so contracting as aforesaid,

his or their Assigns, by virtue of such Order of Transfer as aforesaid, shall have a Property and Interest in

the Service of the said Offender for the Remainder of the Term for which the Offender was originally

ordered to be transported ; and in case such Offender so ordered for Transportation shall be afterwards at

large within any Part of this Kingdom of Great Britain* without some lawful Cause, before the Expiration

of the Term for which such Offender shall have been ordered to be transported, every such Offender,

being thereof lawfully convicted, shall fufter Death as in Cafes of Felony, without Benefit of Clergy; and

shall be tried before such Judges, and in such Manner, and the fame Evidence made use of for his or her

Conviction, as are directed by the Laws now in being for the Trial Qf other Felons found at large within

this Kingdom before the Expiration of the Term for which they were ordered to be transported; and

whoever shall discover, apprehend, and prosecute to Conviction of Felony without Benefit of Clergy, any

such Offender so found at large within this Kingdom, shall be entitled to the like Reward of twenty

Pounds and Certificate, and in the same Manner as any Person may be entitled to for discovering, appre-

hending, and prosecuting to Conviction, any Offender ordered to be transported, and found at large

within this Kingdom before the Expiration of the Term for which such Offender was ordered to be trans-

ported : Provided always, That it shall not be lawful to order any Offender to be transported to the Coast

of Africa, who shall be under Sentence or Order of Transportation to any other Place.

All. And be it further enacted, That the Expences of carrying this Act into Execution, not otherwise

provided for, shall be annually laid before both Houses of Parliament; and after deduding thereout the

Profits, if any, arising from the Earnings of the Offenders who shall labour in any of the Places of Con-

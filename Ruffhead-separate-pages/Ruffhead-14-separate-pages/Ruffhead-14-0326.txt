4 ▼ V Eibtes of such Debtors as became insolvent were generally carried oft’ by the Ddgence of Ar/eft-

4 ment and Poinding, executed by a few Creditors, who, from the Nearness of theirKcfidcncc to and ,

4 Connexion with such Debtors, got the e:uliift Intelligence of the Insolvency, to the great Prejudice of

4 the Diligence of Creditors upon an equal and proper booting, and preventing unjust References and

* Accumulation of Expence, and likewise for operating a more speedy Distribution of the Estates of Bank-

4 rupfs boih real and personal, especially where such Eftares belong to Persons engaged in Trade and

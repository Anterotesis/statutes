4 esquire and declare what Manufactories already were, or thereafter should be, duly qualified to enjoy

4 the Benefit of the Privileges and Immunities by the said Acts bellowed : And whereas, under the tn-

4 couragements held forth by the said Acts of Parliament, two Manufactories were erected in Glasgow,

4 the Year one thousand six hundred and ninety-six, for the making of Ropes and Cordage, the Pro-

4 sixth Article of the Treaty of Union, settled and agreed upon in the fifth Year of the Reign of her

4 late Majesty Queen Anne, between the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland, Provision is made in the

4 Terms following; videlicet, 44 That all Parts of the United Kingdom, for ever, from and after the

44 Union, shall have the fame Allowances, Encouragements, and Drawbacks, and be under the fame

44 Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Regulations of Trade, and liable to the fame Customs and Dunes

4 Doubts and Disputes did arise between the Officers of her Majesty’s Customs and the Proprietors of

4 the said Soap and Rope Works, who claimed the Privilege of importing Materials for their respective

4 Manufactories, free of Duties, as a private Right, constituted by the Acts of Parliament and Acts of

• Exchequer and Privy Council before mentioned, and as such, saved by the Exception in favour of

4 private Rights contained in the aforesaid sixth Article of the said Treaty of Union ; to which Claim the

4 Officers of the Revenue objected, that the Exemption from Duties, given by the Acts of Parliament,

4 and Exchequer and Privy Council of Scotland, was not in the Nature of a private Right, but of a publick

4 Encouragement to Trade, and as such was determined and at an End by the Treaty of Union; in

4 respect to which Disputes, it was agreed upon, as an interim Expedient, that the Proprietors of the

4 aforesaid Manufactories should grant Bonds for the Duties of the Materials to be imported by them,

4 with Condition to pay the fame, in case the Parliament of Great Britain, or Court of Exchequer in

4 Scotland, should adjudge the said Materials liable to the Payment of Duties ; which Agreement of taking

4 such conditional Bonds as aforesaid was, for some Time, carried into Execution, until ,the Com-

4 missioneis of the Customs at Edinburgh gave orders for levying the Duties upon all such Material®

4 imported for the Use of the said Manufactories as were by Law chargeable with Duties uoon being

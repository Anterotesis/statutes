XXIV, Provided likewise, and it is hereby declared and enacted, That no Part of the Money to arise

by or on account of the Tolls or Rates established by virtue of the said former Act, or this Act, shall be

applied for any Ufa of Purpofi* relnting to widening the said Street or Place called The Turl.

-4 XXV. And whereas, in pursuance of the Directions and Powers contained in the before*recited Act,

the Committee respectively deputed and appointed by the Chancellor, Matters, and Scholars of the

4 Uoiverfijy of 0.\f$rd% and the Mayo/* Bail ids, and Commonalty of the City of Oxford^ have proceeded

1 to erect and build a new Market, and have completed the fame* on 1 Plot or Piece ot Ground fit out

and described by the Commiflfouers appointed by* or acting under the said Act: And whereas, by the

4 feveralTaws now in Force for recovering Rents in Arrear, the Person distraining any Goods or Chat-

4 tels cannot fell or dispoie of the fame until the Expiration of five Days next after such Distrcfs tak^n,

and Notice thereof given to the Party distrained upon, which has been found inconvenient in l)i it relics

4 made for Arrears of Rents due from Persons occupying Shops and other Erections in the said Marker,

4 by reason of the Goods being of a perfthable Nature :* Be it therefore further enacted, That in all Cafes

where any R$nt shall henceforth become due and be in Arrear, for or in relpcft of any of the said Shops-

and other Erections in the said Market, and any Goods or Chattels shall be taken in Distress for the fame,

and the Tenant or Owner of the Goods or Chattels, so distrained, shall not, within the Sp^ce of twenty-

four Hours next after such Distress taken, and Notice thereof (with the Cause of fuel) Distress) given to

the Person distrained upon, or left at his usual Place of Abode, or upon feme notorious Part of the Pre-

mises charged with the Rent distrained for, replevy the fame, with sufficient Sureties, as in the Cafes of

other Distrefles, then, after such Distrefe and Notice as aforesaid, and Expiration of the said twenry-four

Hours, the Goods and Chattels so taken in Distress shall and may be apprailed, and afterwards fold and

disposed of in such Manner and for such Purposes, and under and subject to such Provisions and Regula-

tions, as ate mentioned and enacted with respect to other Distrefles for Rent; any Law, Statute, or

Usage, to the contrary notwithstanding.

4 XXVL And whereas it. will be more convenient that the present Market for Butter and Eggs Qiould

4 be removed into the said New Market; and feme Doubts have arisen whether Apples, Cherries, and

4 other Fruit, which are fold or exposed to Sale in the said University and City, and Suburbs thereof, are

4 obliged, under and by Force of the before-recited Act, to be brought into and fold in the said New

4 Market:’ Be it therefore further enacted, That it shall not be lawful for any Person or Persons here-

after to vend or expose to Sale any Butter, Eggs, Apples, Cherries, or other Fruit, in any other Place

whatever within the said University, City, or Suburbs than in the said New Market (other than and

except such Apples, Cherries, and Fruit, as shall be sold by Persons inhabiting within the said University,

City, or Suburbs,' within their own Houses or Shops, and which shall be bona fide their Property, and

which shall be raised wiihin their own Gardens or Plantations within the said Univeility or City, or shall

have been by them purchased in the said New Market); and every Person who shall hereafter vend or

expose to Sale any Butter, Eggs, Apples, Cherries, or other Fruit (except as afore'.iul), in any other

Place within the said University, City, or Suburbs, than in the said New Market, shall be subject and

liable to the fame Penalty, and to be recovered and disposed of in the feme Manner as is mentioned and

directed by the said Act, in respect of Persons vending or expefing to Sale any Manner of FIe(h, or other

rawViftuab, Fish, Poultry, Herbs, Roots, or Garden Stuff, in any other Place within the said Uni-

verfity, City, or Suburbs, than in the said Ne*,v Market.

XXVII. Provided always, That nothing herein contained shall prevent, or be construed to prevent,

any Person or Persons from exposing to Sale or felling any Oranges, Lemons, or other b ruit, which shall

be the Growth or Produce of Foreign Parts, within their own Houses or Shops.

4 XXVIII. And whereas the Noith Part of the said New Market consists of an Area, or void Space of

4 Ground, which is occupied upon Market Days by Persons resorting to the said Market with Apples,

4 Peas, Potatoes, and other Garden Stuff, in their several Seatons, and various other marketable Goods

and Commodities, and no Provision is made by the said Act for Payment of any Sum or Sums of Money

in respect thereof:* Be it therefore enacted, That the said Chancellor, Matters, and Scholars, and

Mayor, Bailiffs, and Commonalty, and their respective Successors, or the Committee by them respec-

tively from Time to Time appointed as aforesaid, shall and may demand and take of and from the said

several Persons so occupying the said Area, with their respective Goods as aforesaid, any reasonable Sum

or Sums of Money, by way of and as a Compensation for, and in Proportion to the Space of Ground so

by them respectively occupied.

4 XXIX. And whereas the rating and assessing of the said New Market to the Land Tax in the Parish

4 of Ail Saints in the said City (within which Parish the greater Parc of the said Market is built) hath been

4 productive of much Dispute between the said Committee of the said Market and the Proprietors of

4 Estates within the said Parish of Ail Saints, and the said Committee and Proprietors have come to an

4 Agreement, that so much of the said Market as is situate within the said Parish of All Saints shall from

4 henceforth be considered as an Estate of one hundred and forty Pounds ter Annum, and shall for ever

4 afterwards be assessed to the Land Tax in that Parish as an Estate of that Value: And foralmuch a?4he.

4 Income from tlx; Remainder of the said Market, which is situated in the Parish of Saint Michael, in the

4 said City, is precarious and uncertain, it will be proper and expedient, and may hereafter prevent Dif-

4 putes, to settle and ascertain what yearly Value that Part of the Market shall in future be rated at, to the

4 Land Tax within chat Parish* and the Proprietors of Estates there have hitherto considered the fame as

4 an Estate of forty-six, Paand$ a Year, and the fame hath been accordingly charged to the Land Tax at

that Sum, and they are confirming that the fame shall be established and fixed, so far as concerns the

4 said Land Tax, at that yearly Value :* Be it therefore further enacted, That the said New Market,

and all and every the Shops, Sheds, Stands, Stalls, and other Erections and Buildings therein, and all

Ollier Profits, Advantages, and Emoluments, issuing and arrfing therefrom, or becoming due or payable

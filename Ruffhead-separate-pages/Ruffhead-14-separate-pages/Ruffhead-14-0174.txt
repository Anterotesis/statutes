4 which the said Henry Duke of Buccleugh, Charles Duke of Quectijberrs and Dover, and Archibald Douglas

4 of Douglas Esquire, or any two of them, or the Survivor of them, mould he three, two, or one, as the

4 Cafe might happen), to execute and issue Bonds for the Payment of any Sum or Sums of Money, not

4 exceeding in the Whole five hundred thousand Pounds, for redeeming certain Annuities granted by the

4 Partnership of Douglasy Heron, and Company, or for raising Money thereon for redeeming the said An-

4 require: And by the said Act it is provided, That the said Bonds should not be negociable or transfer-

4 execute and issue Bonds for five hundred thousand Pounds; Part whereof, amounting to the Sum of two

4 hundred and thirteen thousand three hundred Pounds, has already been paid off and discharged, and the

4 Bonds granted in pursuance of the said Aftf have been taken up and cancelled by the said Partnership of

4 Douglas, Heron, and Company; but by reason of the great Fall in the Price of Lands, in which the

4 greatest Part of the Funds of the Company are inverted, and the Difficulty of finding Purchasers for the

4 fame, and of recovering the other Debts due to the Partnership, in the present State of Credit and Situa-

4 mainder of the said Bonds previous to, or upon the said twenty-fourth Day of June, one thousand seven

Stamps, toties quot\esy and as often as Occasion shall be and require, until the twenty-fourth Day of June>

in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-six, and no longer.

II. And be it further enacted and declared by the Authority aforesaid, That this Act shall be deemed,

taken, and allowed, in all Courts within England and Scotland, to be a Publick Act; and shall be

judicially taken Notice of as such by all Judges, Justices, and other Persons, without specially pleading

the fame.

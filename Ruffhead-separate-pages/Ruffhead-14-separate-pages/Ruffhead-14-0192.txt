4 it is amongst other Things enacted, That all such East India Goods as IhaTl be brought into, and con-

Majesty’s Reign, for the like Goods carried into any Out-port in this Kingdom, and there condemned,

4 and afterwards brought to the Port of London for Sale: And whereas Doubts have arisen whether the

4 herein-before recited Acts do extend to Tea, and all other Goods which are usually imported inro this

4 Kingdom by the East India Company:* May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted ;

and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords

Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the

fame, That the said recited Aits, and the several Rules and Restrictions therein prescribed, so far as they

relate to any Goods of the Growth, Product, or Manufacture of the East Indies, condemned as Prize in

this Kingdom, shall in like Manner extend, and be construed to extend, to Tea, and all other Goods or

Commodities whatsoever of the Growth, Product, or Manufacture of China, or any other Country or

Place within the Limits of the Charter granted to the United Company of Merchants of England trading

to the East dndissy which have been, or shall, during the present Hostilities, be brought imo any Port of

this Kingdom, and condemned as Prize, as fully and eiFeilually to all Intents and Purposes as if such Tea,

and other Goods, had been particularly and expressly enumerated in the said Acts*

Kingdom, tni condemned at Prize.

4 II. And whereas by an Ail of Parliament, made in the twelfth Year of the Reign of his late Majesty

* King George the Fit ft, intituled, An Act for repealing the Duty laid upon Snuffy by an Act made in the eighth

4 Tear of her late Majesty s Reign, and for ascertaining the Rates according to which the remaining Duties are to

•4 be paid; and for giving further Encouragement to the Greenland Fiji cry; it is, amongst other Things en-

4 ailed, That in lieu of the former Rates and Duties ad valoremy which were repealed by that Ail, all

4 Snuff imported into anyPort or Place within this Kingdom (hal), upon the Importation thereof, be rated

4 to and pay the several Duties due and payable thereon, according to the Rates and Values therein men-

4 honed, and not according to the Values sworn to or affirmed by the Importers; that is to say, All Snuff

4 imported in British Ships, from any of the British Plantations in Americay or from any Part of the Spanish

4 Weft Indiesy shall be rated at two Shillings and Sixpence for every Pound Weight Avoirdupois5 and all

4 Snuff imported from Italy, Spainy Portugaly and all other foreign Parts, except Franciy shall be rated at

4 five Shillings for every Pound Weight Avoirdupoisy and in that Proportion for any greater or less Quan-

44 tity: And whereas the fraudulent Importers of Snuff, to avoid Payment of the Duties according to the

4 said Rate, have imported into this Kingdom great Quantities of Snuff the Manufacture of Flandersy and

4 entered the fame as French Snuff, upon Oath, at a very low inconsiderable Value, to the great Prejudice

4 of the* public Revenue, and Injury to the fair Trader:* For Remedy whereof, be it enacted by the Au-

thority aforesaid, That, from and after the first Day of May, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two,

all Snuff of the Produce or Manufacture of Francey which shall be imported into this Kingdom, shall be

liable to, and shall pay the fame Duties, and no more, as are or may be due for Snuff imported from Italy,

Spainy or Portugaly according to the said Rate of five Shillings for every Pound Weight thereof, and not

according to the Oath or Affirmation of the Importer; any Thing in the said recited Act, or any other A ft

or Acts of Parliament, to the contrary notwithstanding.

4 III. And, for the better preventing Frauds and Abuses in the clandestine Importation of foreign Snuff

4 into this Kingdom, to the Diminution of the public Revenue, and the Discouragement of the fair

4 Trader;* it is hereby further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That, from and after the first Day of

May, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two, no foreign Snuff shall be brought or imported into

Great Britahy from any Port or Place whatsoever beyond the Seas, otherwise than loose in Calks, Chests,

or Cafes only, each Cask, Chest, or Cafe whereof shall contain three hundred and fifty Pounds Weight of

nett Snuff, at the Ieaft, and shall not be packed in Bags, or in any other Packages, in such Cask, Chest, or

Cafe, under the Penalty of the Forfeiture of all such Snuff as shall be imported contrary to this Act, to-

gether with all the Casks, Chests, Cafes, or other Package, containing the fame; and such Snuff shall and

may be seized by any Officer or Officers of his Majesty's Customs, and sued for, prosecuted, and disposed

of, in the same Manner, and the Officer or Officers so seizing the fame shall be intitled to and allowed the

fame Reward, as is prescribed and directed for other forfeited Snuff by an Act, made in the twenty-fourth

Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, intituled, An Act for the more effectual

securing the Duties upon Tobacco.

4 lv. And whereas the clandestine Importation and Running of Spirits, Tea, and other prohibited

4 Goods, into this Kingdom, has, since the present Hostilities, been carried on to a great Degree in large

4 Vessels, fitted out and armed as Privateers : And whereas, by Means of this illicit Commerce, so preju-

4 dicial to the public Revenue, and the fair Trader, the Powers with whom Great Britain is now at War

* may, and it is apprehended do, often receive Intelligence very detrimental to this Kingdom :* For the

better preventing whereof, be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That, from and after the first

Day of May, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two, if any Ship or VefTet whatsoever, which shall

becommissioned by Letters of Marque, or general Reprizals, or otherwise, by his Majesty’s Commissioners

for executing the Office of Lord Hi^h Admiral of Great Britain, shall be found at Sea in any Part of this

Kingdom, at any Distance from the Coafh thereof, having on Board any foreign Brandy, or other foreign

Spirituous Liquors, in any Vessels or C. fks which shall not contain sixty Gallons at the lead, except only

for the Use of the Seamen then belonging to and on Board such Ship or VeffeI,<not exceeding two Gallons

for each Seaman, or any Tea, not exceeding the Quantity of six Pounds Weight, or any other Goods

whatsoever which arc pr may be liable to Forfeiture, by any Act of Parliament, upon being imported into

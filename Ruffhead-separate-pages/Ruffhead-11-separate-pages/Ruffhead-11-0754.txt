CAP. XLIII.

An Act to regulate the Importation and Exportation of Corn.

HEREAS the several Acts of Parliament heretofore made concerning the Duties and p^le.

Bounties respectively payable on the Importation and Exportation of Corn and Grain have

c have greatly tended to the Advancement of Tillage and Navigation; yet nevertheless, it having

been of late Years found necessary, on account of the small (Quantities of Corn and Grain in

4 Hand, and of the Shortness of the Crops, to suspend the Operation of those Laws by Temporary

4 Statutes, whereby the Benefits derived from the said Acts of Parliament have been, during such

4 Emergencies, withheld and suspended: And whereas the regulating the Importation and Exporta-

4 tion of Corn and Grain by a permanent Law, under such general Rules and Provisions as might

4 render, for the Time to come, such temporary Laws unneceilary, would afford Encouragement to

the Farmer, be the Means of increasing the Growth of that necessary Commodity, and of afford -

4 ing a cheaper and more constant Supply to the Poor, and preventing Abuse in that Article of Trade

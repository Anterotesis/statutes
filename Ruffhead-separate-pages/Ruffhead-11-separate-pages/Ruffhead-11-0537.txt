4 Bishop of Ely, his Lordship’s immediate Predecefibr, an Account hath been adjusted between the

4 Representatives of the said Alatthias and the said Edmund, now Lord Bishop of Ely, of the Di-

4 lapidations incurred on the said Mansion house j and the fame having been estimated at Three thou-

4 sand Pounds, that Sum hath been secured ro the said Edmund, now Lord Bishop of Ely, by Bond,

4 bearing Date the Eighteenth Day of November, One thousand seven hundred and seventy-one, from

4 Charles IVagcr Purvis Esquire, since deceased, payable as therein mentioned : And whereas, upon a

4 proper Survey lately made of the said House, and Offices thereto belonging, it appears that the fame

are, from Length of Time, and other causes, become so decayed, that it hath been advised, by ex-

4 pericnced Workmen, to rc build rather than attempt the Repair thereof: And whereas thereupon,

4 and as no sufficient Fund ofix-red for rebuilding, an Agreement hath been made and reduced into

4 Writing between the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, and

4 thousand seven hundred and seventy-two ; whereby, after reciting, (amongst other Things), that k

4 had been rep efented to their Lordships that the Piece of Ground whereon the said H >use flood

4 might be rendered of considerable Advantage to the Publick, if the fame could b* procured, in order

4 thereon to erect publick Offices; and that the said Eimund Lord Bishop of Ely, beine seised and

# possessed, in Right of his See, of the said Ground and House thereon, was ready and willing, so far

4 as in him lay, to dispose of the fame for the Benefit of the Publick, upon a full and adequate CW-

4 penfarion being made to him and his Successors, and the said See of Ely, in lieu thereof; and that

4 their Lord'hips were desirous the fame might be purchased for the Service of the Publick, and that the

4 said Lord Bishop of Ely, and his Succefiurs, and the said See of Ely, might, out of the Publick

- 4 Money, receive a reasonable Considerarion for the fame: Anl further reciting, that, upon a Treaty

4 between their Lordships and the said Edmund, now Lord Bishop of Ely, and upon proper Surveys

4 taken, and Calculations made thereon, it had appeared and been agreed on, that a clear Sum of Six

4 thousand five hundred Pounds, and a clear Annuity of Two hundred Pounds, forever, would bei

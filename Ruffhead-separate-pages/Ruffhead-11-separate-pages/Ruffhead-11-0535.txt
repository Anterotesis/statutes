4 England, and the Barons of the Exchequer, and thereupon the said Place or Piece of Ground was

4 Law, whether the said'Place or Piece of Ground, upon the Dissolution of the said Hospital, efeheated

4 to Her then Majesty Queen Anne, in Right of her Crown of England, or whether the fame reverted

4 to Her said Majesty, as Parcel of the Duchy of Lancaster, whereby it is uncertain in what Manner

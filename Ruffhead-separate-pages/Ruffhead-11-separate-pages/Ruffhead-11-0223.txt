CAP. XXXIV.

An Act for enabling certain Persons to inclose and embank Part of the River Thames, ad-

. joining to Durham 2'ard, Sahjhury Street, Cecil Street, and Beaufort Buildings, in the County

of Middlesex.

€ \ T 7 HEREAS the Course of the River Thames forms a Targe Bend or Angle round the Surrey Shore,

4 VV between Westminster Bridge and the Neiv Bridge at Black Friars, in the Middle of which Bend the

4 said River is much wider than at either of the said Bridges, which tends to weaken the Rapidity of the

4 Stream, and thereby contributes to an Accumulation of Mud and Silt on the Westminster Side, and to a

4 very extensive Sand Bank on the other Side : And whereas the Navigation of the said River is greatly im-

4 peded by the said Sand Bank, especially at Low Water, and the Mud and Silt so collected on the North

4 Shore renders the Access to the Wharfs and Grounds on that Side very difficult, and in some Parts of the

4 Tide impaflible, to the maniftft Injury of the Public, as well as private Detriment to the Proprietors of

4 the said Wharfs and Grounds : And whereas the said Navigation might be greatly improved, and the said

4 Nuifinces and Inconveniencies considerably diminished by an Embankment on the North Part of the said

4 River, within the Bay or Hollow of the said Bend, which, by advancing the unequal and irregular Fronts

* of the said Wharfs and Grounds into an uniform Line, would give a proper Direction to the Stream, and,

4 by narrowing the unnecessary Width of the Bed of the said River in this Part, would considerably deepen

4 the Channel thereof: And whereas John Adam, Robert Adam, James Adam, and JFt Mam Adam, and

4 James Paine, Architects, Dorothy Monk Widow, Clementina Paivjon Widow, and I Pi ill am Kitchiner

4 Coal Merchant, having very valuable Freehold and Leafchold Interests in the Houses, Wharfs, and

4 Grounds in Durham lard, Salifhwy Street, Cecil Street, and Beaufort Buildings, next adjoining to the

4 said River, are willing to execute such Embankment in the Front of their respeflive Properties at their

4 own Expence: But such Embankment cannot be lawfully and eiFcdlually made without the Authority of

4 Parliament;* May it therefore please your Majesty, upon the humble Petition of the said John Adam,

Robert Adam, James Adam, and William Adam, James Paine, Dorothy Monk, Clementina Pazufcn, and Wil-

liam Kitchiner, that it may be enabled ; and be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and

with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parlia-

ment a (Ternbled, and by the Authority of the same. That it shall and may be lawful to and for the said

John Adam, Robert Adam, James Adam, I Villi am Adam, James Paine, Dorothy Monk, Clementina Pawfon,

and William Kitchiner, their respective Heirs, Executors, Administrators, or Assigns, at their own proper

Costs and Charges, to inclose and embank so much of the Ground and Soil of the said River, as lies on the

North Side thereof, in the Front of their respective Houses, Wharfs, and Grounds in Durham Yard, S'j-

Hfbury Street, Cecil Street, and Beaufort Buildings, aforesaid, so as the Wall of such Embankment next the

said River do run in a Line nearly parallel with, and not exceeding the DiAance of eighty Feet from the

'Terras lately begun, and now neatly completed in the Front, and intended to constitute a Part of certain

Buildings at or near Du ham aforesaid, called The Adclphi, from a Point in the said River, over-againli

the South-east Corner of the said Terras, to another Point in the lame River, over-agftnft the South-weft

Corner of the fame Terras ; and from thence, with a convex-circular Sweep, fiom the Did last-mentioned

Point, to the South-east Corner of the Terras belonging to York Buildings, and so as the said Wall next

the said River do run in a strait Line, from the said fiift-mentioned Point, to a Point in the said River over-

agair.ft and in a Line with, and not exceeding the DiAance of sixty Feet from the Last Boundary of the

Ground and Buildings of the said Jfid:am Kitchiner; and from the said last-mentioned Point, with a con-

vex-circular Sweep, to the South-weft Corner of the projecting Wall of the Buildings commonly called 7he

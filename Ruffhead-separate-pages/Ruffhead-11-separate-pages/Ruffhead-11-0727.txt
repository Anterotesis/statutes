CAP. XXX.

An Act for the better Regulation and Government of the Pilots conducing Ships and

Vessels to and out of the Port of King's Lynn, and of the Bridgemen conducting Gangs

of Lighters or Barges to and from the same \ and for laying down Moorings in the

Harbour of the said Port, and for preventing Mischiefs by Fire therein.

4 X WHEREAS the Borough of Lcnnc Regis, commonly called Kings Lynny in the County of

Norfolk, is a very ancient Borough, within the Liberties wher.of there are a Port and Har-

4 hour of the Sea for importing and exporting Merchandise; and the Mayor and Burgefll-s of the

4 said Borough have, by Royal Charter, been a Corporation for Two hundred Years last pass and up-

4 wards, and by certain Letters Patent, granted them by King fames the First, dated the Nineteenth

4 Day of November, in the Secon I Year of His Reign, were conffituted (and now are) Admirals

c within the said Borough, and the Port, Limits, and Bounds thereof; and, by virtue of the fame Let-

4 tersPatent, and others fmee granted to them by the Crown, and by long Usage have ertilcd and

4 put down proper Buoys and Beacons in the Channel of the said Port, and appointed Pilots for

4 conducing Ships and Vessels into and out of the said Borough and Port, from and to a certain

4 Place called Saint Edmund's Nefsy otherwise Gor: End, and from thence North and by Weft to

4 another Place or Sand called Longfand, being the utmost Bounds Northwa:ds of the said Admiralty

4 Jurisdiction, and have also appointed other Persons, commonly called Bridgemen, to conduct Gangs

4 of Lighters or Barges into and out of the said Borough and Port, from and to a certain Place called

4 Staple IVeere, being the utmost Bounds Southwards of the said Admiralty Jurisdiction: And whereas

the Channel from Gore End and the Longfand aforesaid to the said Port or Habour of King's Lynn,

and from thence to Staple IVeere aforesaid, is become a more difficult and dangerous Navigation than

4 heretofore for Ships, Vessels, and Lighters, respcilively using the fame, and many Ships have been

4 wrecked, and Lighters and Barges funk, by Means of the large Bodies of Sand which often shire

4 from Place to Place, and by Means of the double-fluked Anchors now 11 fed in the said Harbour,

c and divers unskilful Persons, without the Licence or Authority of the said Mayor and Burgcfles,

4 have often'taken upon themselves,to ait as Pilots and Bridgemen for the Conducting and Guidance

4 of Ships, Vessels, and Lighters, to and from the said Port, to the great Hazard of such Snips, Veflelsy

and Lighters, and their Cargoes, and the Lives of the Persons on Board the fame, and to

the Obstruition of Navigation: And whereas the Flood and Ebb Tides in the said Harbour

4 run very rapid and strong, and the Harbour oppofrte the Town of late Years is become

4 much wider towards the South-weft, so that when the Ebb runs ftrrng, and the Wind

4 blows hard at the fame Time, Ships and Vessels lying there, are ofren driven from their Moor-

4 ings, and funk in the said Harbour: And whereas Losses by Fire have happened to Mer-

4 chants and Owners of Ships and trading Vessels, lying in the said Harbour, occasioned by

the heating of Pitch, Tar, Rosin, Oil, or other combustible Matters on board such Ships and

Vessels: And whereas the Powers and Authorities vested in the said Mayor and Burgelfcs arc

4 found not suficient or eftcitual to regulate and govern the said Pilots and Bridgemen, and to

4 remedy and prevent the ill Praitices and Mischiefs before mentioned: And whereas the Damages

4 sustained in the Harbour might, in a great Measure be prevented by laying down substantial An-

4 chors forpublick Use, furnished with proper Rings, Chains, and Floats, commonly called Harbour

4 Moorings, for the more effectual securing the Ships and Vessels riding in the said Harbour from

4 driving on Shore by voilent Storms of Wind, by raging Tides, by great Land Floods, or other-

- 4 wife; but as the laying down such Moorings will be attended with great Expence, the fame cannot

4 be carried into Execution without the Aid of Parliament therefore, and for the Benefit and Im-

provement of Trade and Navigation, and promoting the Safety of His Majesty’s Subjeils, may it

please Your Majesty that it may be enaited; and be it enaited by the King’s most Excellent Ma-

jesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in

this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, 'That from and after the Twenty-

fourth Day of June, One thousand seven hundred and seventy-three, if any Person or Per Tons shall

take upon him orthemselves to conduct or pilot any Ship or Vefl'el, or any Gang of Lighters or

Barges, inro or out of the said Port of King's Lynn, or between Saint Edmund's Nefs% otherwise Gore

End, and Steeple IVeere aforesaid, without being licensed so to do by the said Mayor and Biirgdh s for

; the l ime being, which Licences the said Mayor and Burgcfl’es arc hereby impo^ered to grant under

their Common Seal; every Person so offending shall, for every such Offence, forfeit and pay any Sum

not exceeding Three Pounds, nor less than Twenty Shillings.

II. Prov ided nevertheless, That the said Mayor and Burgesses shall not Jicenfe or authorise any Per-

son or Persons to be Pilots of the said Borough and Port as aforesaid, unless such Person or Persons

Two of such Masters or Commanders being Maffers or Commanders of Ships belonging to One

Merchant or Owner), certifying the Ability and Skill of such Person or Persons to pilot or conduit

Ships and Vessels. to and from the said Port \ nor shall they license or authorise any Person or Persons

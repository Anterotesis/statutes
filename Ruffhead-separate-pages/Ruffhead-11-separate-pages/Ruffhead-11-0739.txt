the Establishment of a Glass Manufactory in Great Britain, upon an improved

Preamble. < yjy pjan> jn a peculiar Manner, calculated for the casting of Plate Glass,. would be of great

4 Benefit and Utility to this Kingdom, and may tend, as well to increase the pub lick Revenue

4 arising from the Duties laid thereOn, as to improve the prdfent Method of making Plate Glass,

4 Which is not brought to a State of Perfection equal to that in foreign Countries: And whereas

4 such Manufactory cannot be established without great Risk in the Undertaking, and without a very

4 large Expence, nor can be conveniently carried on, unless a considerable Joint Stock is raised for

that Purpose: And whereas several Persons have already formed themselves into a Society, and

4 subsertbed considerable Sums, and purchased Materials, and engaged proper Persons, for the Pur-

4 pose of cftaMishing and carrying on the said Manufactory; but Inch Persons are apprehensive that

4 Difficulties may arise, as well in recovering Debts which may grow due to the Proprietors of the

4 said Manufactory, as also in defending Suits or ACtions whion may be commenced or brought

the Intent and Meaning of any of the Laws now in Force concerning Bankrupts, are likewise

4 fearful of subscribing Money to carry on the said Manufacture, as by becoming Subscribers to,

and Part Owners thereof, they may be liable to have Commissions of Bankrupt iliued against them

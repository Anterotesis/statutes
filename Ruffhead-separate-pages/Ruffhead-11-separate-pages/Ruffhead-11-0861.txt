* XI 7 HERE AS the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies do

4 VV at present labour, and have, for some Time past, laboured under great and unusual Difficul-

4 ties in the carrying on of their Affairs, from which it greatly imports the Publick, as well as the

4 said United Company, that they should, as speedily as possible, be relieved : And whereas the said

4 Company, finding themselves under the Neceffny of applying to Parliament for Relief did, by their

4 Petition to the House of Commons, make Application for the Loan of One Million five hundred

* thousand Pounds, or so much as {hould be wanted to be advanced, and repaid in such Manner, and

4 to be attended with such other Conditions and Provisions as in their said Petition is set forth, in

4 consequence whereof the House of Commons came to several Resolutions, specifying the Terms

4 upon which it might be expedient for the Publick to advance to the said United Company the Sum

4 of One million four hundred thousand Pounds, and the several Limitations which ought to accom-

4 pany such Loan : And whereas the said United Company did, by asubsequent Petition, declarethcir

4 Determination to depend on the Laws of their Country, and submit to the temporary Difficulties

4 which may 'attend the present Situation of their Affairs, rather than*receive the Loan offered to them

4 upon the Conditions prescribed : And whereas, in case the said Company should not be forth-

4 with assisted by the Publick with the Advance of a considerable Sum of Moqey, they would re-

4 main altogether unable to provide for the Payment of their Debts, some of which Debts being

4 due to the Publick, and others to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England', the Payment

4 thereof could not long be postponed without great Prejudice to the Publick Service, and Dif-

4 advantage to publick Credit, and yet could not be expedited or secureJ otherwise than by the Use

4 of such Methods as must be attended with Consequences the most fatal to the said United Com*

4 pany; and, forasmuch as upon Consideration of the several Matters before mentioned, it appears

4 absolutely necessary that immediate Provision should be made by Parliament for giving Assistance to

4 the said Company, in such Manner, and upon such Terms, as may be best calculated for eftecting

4 the Preservation of the said United Company, and the Re-establishment of their Affairs, without

4 leaving it in the Power of the General Court of Proprietors, by withholding their Consent to the

4 Acceptance of such Assistance, to expose, at once, each Separate Proprietor.of East India Stock,

4 the Company it Self, the Creditors oi the Company, and the Publick, to all the Mischiefs which

4 must attend the Want of such Assistance, as a fore said : And whereas it hath been resolved that

4 a Sum, not exceeding One million four hundred thousand Pounds, be granted to His Majesty, to

4 be applied for the Purpose of relieving the East India Company, and for Securing to the Creditors of

4 the said Company a more speedy Satisfaction of their Demands :* Now, to the End that no Want

or Failure may happen or be made by Reason or Means of such Grant, and the Application of the

fame, in the Aids granted, or to be granted, in this Session of Parliament, for defraying the several

publick Services, and for answering which the said Aids were, or may be intended to be applied ;

and, for the better , Supplying the said Sum of One million four hundred thousand Pounds, and

applying the same in the most effectual Manner for the Purposes above mentioned ; we Your Majesty’s

most dutiful and loya! Subjects, the Commons of Great Britain, in Parliament assembled, do most

humbly bcfecch Your Majesty that it may be enacted ; and! be it enacted by the King’s most Ex-

cellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and

Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and

may be lawful to and for the Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, now and for the Time be-

ing, or any Three or more of them, or for the High Vreafurer for the Time being, and he and

they respectively are hereby authorised and impowered, at any Time or Times before the First Day

of Oilober, One thousand seven hundred and fev< nty-three, by his or their Warrant or Warrants,

to direct, or cause to be prepared and made, at the Receipt of His Majesty’s Exchequer, any Num-

chequer Bills, so to be made forth in pursuance of this Act, shall bear an Interest not exceeding the

Rate of Four Pounds per Centum per An/ uni, and proportionally for any greater or less Sum to be

contained therein, to be payable to the Bearers thereof respectively ; which said Exchequer Bills

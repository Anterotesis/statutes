and Purposes as if the said A# had never been made: And whereas the said Gerald Fitzgerald is seised of

the Towns and Lands herein after mentioned, claiming Title thereto in the fame Maimer as in the said

4 A# of the fourth Year of his present Majesty’s Reign was mentioned with respe# to the Lands therein

4 comprised, and his present Majesty is also seised of the Reversion in Fee of the Towns and Lands herein

4 after mentioned, claiming Title thereto in the same Manner, and by virtue of the fame Forfeiture, as

4 was mentioned and set forth in the said A# of Parliament passed in the fourth Year of his present Ma-

4 thereof, expired, and the said Lands came into the Occupation of the said Gerald Fitzgerald, the Grand

4 Nephew and Heir of the said Gerald Fitzgerald the Patentee, as the Owner thereof, in bad Condition*

4 and, by reason of the many Debts and Incumbrances charged upon the said Land*, the said Gerald Fitz-

4 gerald hath not been able to put the said Lands into a State of Cultivation and Improvement, so as to let

the fame to good and substantial Tenants \ and in case the said Lands were offered to Sale in their pre-

4 sent Condition, the fame must be sold to a great Disadvantage; but the fai6 Gerald Fitzgerald, for the

x Security of his Creditors, since the patting of the said last-mentioned A#, hath executed a Mortgage of

the Lands in the said former A# mentioned, or Part thereof, unto the Reverend John Alagill, Clerk,

4 one of his Creditors, for securing six thousand six hundred thirty-three Pounds two Shillings and seven

4 Pence three Farthings, being the Amount of his Demand, and the Demands of several other Creditors 5

Majesty, is advised, that noPerson will contract or treat for the Purchase of the Lands in the said former

4 Act, unless they are discharged from all the Debts to which the fame are liable, and put into proper Or-

4 der and Condition, and let to Tenants, but a favourable Opportunity now offers for Sale of the Towns

and Lands of Innifcoffy and Old Towns herein after mentioned, at a high Price, which will raise Money

sufficient to pay off the said Elizabeth O'Farrell's Mortgage, in case the Fee-simple and Inheritance

4 thereof could be safely conveyed to the Purchaser thereof; whereby not only a more ready Fund for the

4 Payment of the Debts assessing the said Lands, and for the Security of the said Gerald Fitzgerald's Per-

4 son, would be provided, but the said Gerald Fitzgerald would be enabled to put the Lands in the said

4 former A# mentioned into proper Condition and Repair, whereby the fame would also become feleable,

and the many heavy Incumbrances which now asse# the said Lands be paid off and discharged; but the

4 said Lands herein after mentioned cannot be mortgaged or fold without diverting the Reversion ill Fee

4 thereof out of his Majesty, in like Manner as in and by the said last-mentioned A# of Parliament was

4 done with respc# to the Lands therein comprised, and which said last-mentioned A# parted by the Grace

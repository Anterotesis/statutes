4 VV at a great Expence by their respective Parishes and Places: And whereas the granting of proper

4 .Powers for the better Government and Regulation of the Poor of the said City, and providing a Place for

4 their general Reception, will tend to the more effectual AiTiftance and Relief of such as by Age, Infir-

4 mities, or Diseases, are rendered incapable of supporting themfclveshy their Labour, to the better Em-

4 ployment of the Able and Industrious, to the Correction and Punishment of the Profligate and Idle, and

4 to the Education of Poor Children in Religion and Industry ; and thereby the Poor, instead of being

4 wholly supported by the Public, may contribute to the Support, Assistance, and Relief, mutually of

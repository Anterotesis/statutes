4 ous to Travellers: And whereas the Roads from the said Bridge, through the several Streets in the said

4 Univcifity and City, to the great Roads lying on the North, South, and Weft Sides of the said Univer-

fity and City, are in many Parts so very narrow and incommodious, and so greatly obstructed by Nui-

4 fances and Annoyances, as well as by various Incroachments and Projections, as to render the said Roads

4 inconvenient and dangerous to Travellers: And whereas the said University and City, and the Suburbs

4 thereof, and the Parish of St. Clement, are not properly cleansed or lighted; and are much annoyed by

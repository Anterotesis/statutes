An Act to prevent unlawful Combinations of Workmen.—[12th July 1799.]

Kingdom, have, by unlawful Meetings and Combinations, endeavoured to obtain Advance of

their Wages, and to effectuate other illegal Purposes; and the Laws at present in Force against such un-

4 lawful Conduct have been found to be inadequate to the Suppression thereof, whereby it is become necessary

4 unlawful Practices in future, and for bringing such Offenders to more speedy and exemplary Justice:

tity of Work, or for preventing or hindering any Person or Persons from employing whomsoever he, she, or

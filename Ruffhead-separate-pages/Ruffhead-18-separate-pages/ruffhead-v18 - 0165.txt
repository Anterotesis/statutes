Vbfly, in which the Names of all* Persons at present liable to serve in the Militia have been included,

there to remain until a frdh Ballot {hall! take place in such Parish or Place* as prescribed and directed by

the aforesaid ASL

c H. ‘ A nd whereas it may fbmetimes happen, that Persons alleged to be liable, in pursuance of this present

A<9, to serve in the Militia, but entitled, on Account of Age or other special Ground of Exemption, to

4 have their Names struck out of the Militia Lift, may, from Ignorance or excufaHe Neglect, fail to come

forward in due Time to state the fame to the Subdivision Meeting appointed for amending and making

of such Lifts, and thereby become liable to serve in the Militia, provide a Substitute or pay the Penalty

be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for such Persons failing or neglecting as aforesaid, within three Ca-

lendar Months from the Day on which such Subdivision Meeting aforesaid has been held, to state by Peti-

lion such Cause of Exemption to a General Meeting of Lieutenants and Justices of the County, Stewartry,

City, or Place, who are hereby authorized and empowered, if they shall fee Cause, to order the Name of

fcch Person to be ftiuck out of the Militia Lift, and his Name to be taken out of the Ballot Box: Provided

always. That the said Lieutenants or justices, a (Tern bled as aforesaid, shall be empowered, and they are

hereby authorized and empowered, at the fame Time that they shall allow such Cause of Exemption, to im-

pose and levy from such Person such Fine as they may judge, upon the whole Circumstance of the Cafe, ade-

quate to the Neglc£t of the Individual, such Find in no Ca'e to exceed the Sum often Pounds Sterling; which

Sum the said General Meeting are hereby authorized and directed to apply to the Purpose of providing

Substitntes, in like Manner as they are directed by this and the other Militia Acts to apply the Penalties of

Persons ballotted, but refusing to serve or provide a Substitute: Provided also, That no such Person shall

have his Name struck out of the said Lift, or taken from the Ballot Box, until he shall have paid into the

Hands of the Clerk of the said Meeting the Fine awarded against him.

III. And whereas it has been found from Experience, that the Penalty of ten Pounds Sterling, drredldd

to be paid by Persons ballotted, but refusing to serve, or to find Substitutes in their Room, has proved in-

sufficient to enable the Deputy Lieutenants to provide Substitutes for them, and Doubts have arisen in

that Cafe as to the Mode of applying and accounting for the said Penalties be it therefore enacted. That

the said Lieutenant, Deputy Lieutenants, and Justices, assembled in a General Meeting held in pursuance

of this or any other Act or Acts now in Force respecting the Militia, shall order the Clerk of the said

Meeting to make up an Account of all the Penalties incurred within ther said County, Stewartry, City, or

Place, and shall direct the Amount of the fame to be forthwith, and as quickly as possible, applied in providing

(so far as it will go) Substitutes to serve in the Militia; and where the total Amount of such Penalties

shall be found inadequate to the Purpose 0/ providing, the full Number of Substitutes required, it shall be

lawful for the said General Meeting, and they are hereby authorized and empowered to allot the said Sub-

stitutes so provided to the several deficient Parishes from which the aforesaid Penalties arise, as far as possible,

and that either by ballotting which of the fakl Parishes shall be relieved by the Allotment of the said Sub-

stitutes, or in such other Mode as shall appear to the said General Meeting just and equitable, and bsft

calculated for laying the Burthen of providing the remaining Number of Men still deficient as equally as

poftibie over the said Parishes, and shall proceed to order and direct a Ballot to be held in the same Manner

and Form as prescribed by the said Acts, by such Parishes as they shall declare or appoint to remain (till

liable to make good the Deficiencies: Provided always, That the Commanding Oftkers of the respective

Regiments of Militia shall be, and they are hereby empowered, at the End of every rhree Months from

and after the first Day of duguji one thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine, if necessary, to require, by

written Notice sent to the Clerk of the General Meetings for each County, Stewartry, City, or Place,

furmihing Militia Men to such Regiment, a General or Subdivision Meeting to be called and held, as the

Cafe may render neeeft’ary, for the Purpose of supplying the Number of Men still deficient, from such

County, Stewartry, City, or Place, and the said Lieutenant, Deputy Lieutenants, or Justices, shall, and

they are hereby required, within ten Days after the Receipt of such Notice, to hold such General or Sub-

division Meeting for the Purpose aforesaid, in order that the full Number of Militia due by such County*

Stewartry, City, or Place, may be furnished to the said Regiment as speedily as poftibie.

IV. And whereas by the said Act passed in the thirty-seventh Year of the Reign of his present Majesty,

it is enacted, That every Personchofen by Ballot according to the Directions of the said Act (not being

4 one of the People called Quakers) refusing or negleting to appear to take the Oath and serve in the

4 Militia, or to provide a Substitute, shall forfeit and pay the Sum of ten Pounds Sterling, and whenever any

^Ballot shall take place in the same Parish or Place, be liable to serve again or provide a Substitute, and in

4 Default of Payment of such Penalty, or for Want of sufficient Effe#s whereon to levy the same, the Name

4 of such Person shall be entered upon the Roll for which he was ballotted, and he shall be compelled to serve

4?in like Manner as any other Person whofhould be then ballotted for would be compellable to serve, and shall

4 be subject to the fame Puniftrments for afterwards absconding or deserting, as he would have been subject

4 to in case he had appeared and been duly (worn and enrolled as a Militia Man :* Be it enabled, That when-

ever any such Person shall have his Name drawn a second l ime on any Ballot, it (hull be in his Power in

place of serving personally or providing a Substitute, on Payment of a further Penalty of five Pounds Sterling,

tohave his Name struck out of the Lift of Militia Men altogether, and be for ever relieved from serving ui

the'Militia; which further Penalty shall be recovered and applied by the Lord Lieutenant, Deputy Lieute-

nants, and Justices, in like Manner as all other Penalties are directed to be recovered and applied by the pre-

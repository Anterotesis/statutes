CAP. LV.

that Part of Great Britain called Scotland.—[13th June 1799.]

4 XT WHEREAS it is found by Experience, that the Servitude of Thirlage, and Right of Mill Services

4 VV incident thereto, in that Part of Great Britain called Scotland, are very unfavourable to the gene-

4 ral Improvement of the Country, by checking the Industry of the Occupiers of the Ground, and by oc-

4 cafioning troublesome and expensive Litigation; and that it is highly expedient that it should be allowed to

4 Persons subject to such Servitude to compensateor to commute the fame by a fixed annual Payment, in lieu

4 and Satisfaction of the said Right of Thirlage, and of all Services, Predations, and Restrictions, thereto

• incident or pertaining, and in some Cafes to make an entire and complete Purchase of the fame for a fair

4 and adequate PriceTherefore be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the

Advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament affem-

bled, and by the Authority of the same. That, from and after the passing of this Act, it shall and may be

lawful for the Proprietor or Proprietors of any Lands or Tenements thirled or adrifted to any Mil), in that

4 \ T HEREAS by an Act, passed in the thirty-fifth Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, intituled, 35 Geo.3.0.116,*

An Act for widening and improving the Entrance into the City of London, near Temple Bar, for

4 making a more commodious Street or Passage at Snow Hill, and for raising on the Credit of the Orphans9

4 Fund, a Sum of Money for those Purposes \ by which Ad the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the

^ City of London, in Common Council assembled, were empowered to borrow and raise in the Manner

4 therein expressed, the Sum of one hundred thousand Pounds upon the Credit of the Fund therein described

4 or mentioned, called The Orphans* Fund, to be applied to the Purposes of the said Act: And whereas an 3* G.co, 3*

4 Ad was passed in the thirty-eighth Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, to explain, amend, and c*

4 enlarge the Powers of the before-mentioned Act: And whereas, considerable Progress hath been mad6 in

*-carrying the said Acts into Execution, whereby the Entrance into the said City at Temple Bar hath been

4 greatly improved: And whereas, in forming the original Estimate of the Expences of effecting the said

4 Improvements, sufficient Allowances were not made for the subsequent Depreciation of the Bonds and

4 Securities which by the first recited Act were directed to be given, for securing the Monies thereby au-

4 thorized to be borrowed; nor were adequate Allowances made for the Sums paid and to be paid in fe-

4 veral unforeseen Cafes, as Compensations for Good-Will, Losses, and Damages, to Persons occupying

4 or being interested in Houses or other Hereditaments, by the said Acts auihorized to be purchased; and

in the said Estimate Credit was taken for the Monies to be received by Sale of the Ground Rents, and the

4 Reversion, Freehold, and Inheritance of so many Houses, or such Parcels of the Buildings, Lands, Hiene-

4 mems, and Hereditaments by the said Acts authorized to be purchased and taken out of the Streets, as

4 should not be afterwards laid into the Streets, or otherwise appropriated to publick Use; but it being found

4 expedient that the said Improvements to be made at Temble Bar and Snow Hill aforesaid, should be car-

4 ried on at both Places at one and the fame Time, the last mentioned Monies, which will amount to a

4 very considerable Sum, cannot be obtained by such Sale until all the Purchases yet remaining to be made

4 pursuant to the said Acts shall be actually made; for which Reasons the Fund created by the first herein-

4 before recited Act, is found,to be inefficient for completing the said Improvements: And whereas, if the

4 Land Tax charged upon the Houses, Buildings* Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments purchased and to

4 be purchased for the said Improvements, were redeemed according to the Statutes lately made and pro-

4 vided concerning the Redemption and Purchase of the Land Tax, such Redemption would be highly be-

4 neficial not only to the Estate so intended to be sold as aforesaid, but ultimately to the Funds provided and

4 to be provided for carrying on the said Improvements: And whereas, the said Fund called The Orphans9

4 Fund was established'by an Act passed in the fifth and sixth Years of the Reign of King IV:Iliam and Queen

4 MaryAy intituled, An Act for Relief of the Orphans and other Creditors of the City of London, for the Pur- W.&M,

4 poses therein expressed \ which said F und, and the Receipts and Disbursements thereof, are under the Ma- c.io.]

4 nagement and Directionof the Court of Mayor and Aldermen of the said City of London; and by feve-

4 rai AvSIs passed in the twenty-first Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, and in [2I Geo. 2.

the seventh Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, the several Provisions lor supporting the said Fund c. 29; 7 Geo. 3*

4 have been continued and augmented, and the Whole of the Rates and Charges applicable to the said c, 37.]

Fund, from the Time of passing the iaft mentioned Avft, are to remain and continue until the twenty-

4 ninth Day of September which will be in the Year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one*

4 when some of the said Rates and Duties are to cease, but the Sum often thousand Pounds per Annum by the

said A<3s of Parliament, or some of them, charged upon and made payable out of the Revenues of and be-

? longing to the said City of London, and certain other of the Rates and Charges therein also mentioned, are

4 thereby continued ufttil the Principal Monies charged upon the said Orphans* Fund, together with Interest

4 for the fame shall be paid oft' and annihilated: And whereas the Income of the said F und has for several

4 Years past so much increased as to afford a reasonable Probability, that if the said Mayor, Aldermen, and

4 Commons, in Common Council assembled, were enabled to raise the Sum of thirty-thousand Pounds, to

4 be applied for the Purposes of this A&, upon the Credit of the Surpluses toarife from the said F'und, such

4 Surpluses will be amply sufficient to pay off such further Charge, as well as the Interest on the afore-

4 said Sum of sixty thousand Pounds, until redeemed in Manner herein-after mentioned, together with the

4 Whole of the Debt and Sums of Money already charged thereon, previous to the said twenty-ninth Day

4 of September one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one: And whereas it is expedient that the said Mayor,

4 Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled, should be empowered

4 to raise and borrow upon the Credit of the said Fund called The Orphans' Fund the further Sum of thirty

4 thousand Pounds, and upon the Credit of the Monies to arise by Sale of the Ground Rents and Estates to

V be sold by them, in pursuance and by virtue of the said two recited A<Rs and of this Act, the further Sum

of sixty thousand Pounds, to enable them to carry on and complete the said Improvements and redeem the

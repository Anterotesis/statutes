4 said Act is given to His Majesty, His IT‘irs, ami Succeilbrs, is much less than the Duty that would

4 have arisen had the fame Foreign Lienors been duly landed as they ought to have been ; whereby many

4 Persons are tempted to commit great f rauds and Abides to the Prejudice of His Majesty *s Revenue, and

4 of the fair Trad rs : For Remedy thereof,’ be it an vied by the Authority aforesaid. That from and after

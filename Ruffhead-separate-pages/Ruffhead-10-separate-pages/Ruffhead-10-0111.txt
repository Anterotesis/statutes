Mcjl Gracious Sovereign,

4 TT WHEREAS your Majesty, from a tender Concern for your faithful Subjects, and anxious Desire Preamble.

W to provide for every possible Event which may affect their future Happiness or Security, hath been See *4 Geo. 2.

4 graciously pleased to communicate from the Throne to both Houses of Parliament, That your Majesty\ c* 24*

4 late Indifposition (which filled the Breatts of all your Subjc&s with the most alarming Apprchcnfions)

4 had led your Majesty to consider the Situation in which your Kingdoms and your Family might be left,

1 if it should plcale God to put a Period to your Majesty’s Life, whilst your Successor is of tender Years ;

c and that the high Importance of this Subject to the publick Safety, good Order, and Tranquillity, the

4 Paternal Affcdion which your Majesty bears to your Children and to all your People, and your earned

4 Desire that every Precaution should be taken which may tend to preserve the Constitution of Great Bri-

4 tain undisturbed, and the Dignity and Lustre of its Crown unimpaired, had determined your Majesty

4 to lay this weighty llu fine Is before your Parliament; to whose most serious Deliberation your Majesty

4 was pleased to recommend the making such Provisions as would be necessary, in case any of your Children

4 should succeed to the Throne before they should respectively attain the Age of Eighteen Years; and, to

this End, your Majesty was also pleased to propose to their Consideration, whether, under the present

4 Circumstances, it would not be expedient to veil in your Majesty the Power of appointing, from time to

4 time, by Instruments in Writing under your Sign Manual, either the Queen, or any other Person of

4 your Royal Family usually residing in Great Britain, to be the Guardian of the Person of such Successor,

and the Regent of these Kingdoms until such Successor shall attain the Age of Eighteen Years; subject

4 to the like Rcstrictions and Regulations as are specified and contained in an Act pa fled upon a similar

4 Occasion, in the twenty-fourth Year of the Reign of his late Majesty your Royal Grandfather; and that

the Regent so appointed should be assisted by a Council of Regency, to be established by Authority of Par-

4 liament: And whereas, in return for this Paternal Goodness, expressed in so early and provident a Care

4 for an Event so truly deplorable, and being filled with the most cordial Sense of Duty and Gratitude to

4 your Majesty, for the tender Concern and Regard which your Majesty has always, and now more cfpe-

4 dally, demonstrated for the Happiness of your People, and the lading Security of their Religion, Laws,

and Liberties, we have taken this important Business into our most fei ious Consideration; and being justly

4 alarmed at the unhappy Situation in which these Kingdoms and your Majesty’s Royal Family would be

4 left, in case it should please Almighty God to put a Period to your Majesty’s inestimable Life (for the

4 long and glorious Continuance of which we offer up our daily and most fervent Prayers to Heaven) bc-

4 fore your Royal Successor {hall be of sufficient Years to support the Weight of Government; and being

4 likewise thoroughly convinced of the Wisdom and Expediency of what your Majesty has thought fit to

4 propose upon this weighty Occasion, are fully and zealously determined to contribute every Thing in our

4 Power to the firm and laffing Establishment of the Protestant Succeftion, as settled by the Laws of the

4 Land, in your Majesty’s Royal Family, the auspicious Encrease of which we consider as the Bulwark of

4 our Civil and Religious Liberties, and the Pledge of perpetual Security to the Laws and Conftuuti m of

4 Great Br itain We therefore, your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Lords Spiritual and

Temporal, and Commons, in Parliament assembled, do most humbly beseech your Majesty that it may

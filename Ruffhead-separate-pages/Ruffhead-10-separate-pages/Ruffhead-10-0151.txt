* Penny Beer or Aley by their refusing to permit or suffer the Gau?er or Gaugers, Officer or Officers, to

4 stay and continue in their Brew-houses, Store-houses, or other Places, in the same Manner as all other

• Brewers are obliged and accustomed to permit and suffer them, to fee such Guiles or Brewings brewed

€ off, cleansed, and carried out without Mixture, and by their frauduently carrying a great Part of their

* Beer or Worts away from the Sight and View of such Gauger or Gaugers, Officer or Officers, before

4 the fame have been charged with any Duty, and which is evidently discovered to be the Practice of such

4 Brewers; from the constant great Difparities which have been, and still are, from time to time, found by

• the Gauger or Gaugers, Officer or Officers, on their Surveys, between the Cheque Gauges of their Beer

4 or Worts taken in the Coppers, and the real Gauges of the fame Beer or Worts when cast out of the

4 Coppers and thrown into the Backs or Coolers, and from whence the Duty is charged, whereby his Ma-

Revenue has been lessened and diminished more than one half to what the fame was formerly :9

aforesaid, and other Frauds practised to the Detriment of the Revenue ; be it declared and enacted by the

drawn or made, or during such Part of such Brewing or Operation as such Gauger or Gaugers, Officer or

Officers, shall think fitting and convenient to (lay and continue; such Brewer, Innkeeper, or Victualler,

for every such Offence, shall forfeit and lose the Sum of twenty Pounds; and the Informer or Prosecutor on Penalty of

of such Guile of Beer or Ale before he paid and cleared the Duties for the fame; any thing in the former

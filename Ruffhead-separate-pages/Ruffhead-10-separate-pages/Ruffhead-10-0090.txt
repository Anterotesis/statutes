4 and twenty thousand Pounds, if it determines the fame to one Half the fame Distance: And wherea*

4 in and by the said Act it was further enabled, That if, upon Trial, any Proposal for discovering the

€ said Longitude {hould not prove to be of so gn at Use a? before-mentioned, yet if the fame, in the

4 Judgement of the said Commissioners, or the major Part of them, should be found of considerable Use

4 to the Publick, then the said Author or Authors of such Proposal {hould receive such less Reward as the

4 said Commissioners, or the major Part of them, {hould think reasonable: And whereas the said Com-

,4 missioners have, from time to time, in pursuance of the Powers veiled in them by the said Act, received

4 Proposals from Mr. John Harrison for discovering the said Longitude, determined by Means of certain Machines

4 or Time Keepers invented by him, and have directed several Sums of Money to be paid to the said

4 John Harrlfon, to enable him to finish his said Machines or Time Keepers, or some of them, upon

4 Condition of his delivering the fame up to and for the Use of the Publick : And whereas the said John

4 Harrison did, by Direction of the said Commissioners, enter into Articles with the Commissioners of

4 the Navy, whereby he agreed, in Consideration of the Sums so advanced to him, to deliver up the three

4 several Machines or Time Keepers in the said Articles mentioned : And whereas, upon Trial of one

4 other Watch Machine or Time Keeper in a Voyage to Jamaica, the major Part of the said Commis-

4 sioners did adjudge the fame to be of considerable Use to the Publick, and did accordingly order the

4 Payment of the Sum of two thou land five hundred Pound to the said John Harrison, which Sum was

4 to be deemed and taken as Part of such of the Rewards, in and by the Lid Act allowed for discovering

4 the said Longitude, as he might become intitled to, and as such has been by him received ; and the

4 said Watch or Time Keeper was to become the Property of the Publick : And whereas upon a further

4 Trial of the said last-mentioned Watch or Time Keeper, a Ship has filled, by the Appoimment of the

4 Commissioners for the Discovery of the Longitude, from Portsmouth in Great Britain, to Bridgettnvn in

4 the Island of' Bar badoes in the Hrjl Indies: And whereas, by Means of the said Watch or Time Keeper

4 invented by Mr. John Harrison, the said Ship did not lose its Longitude beyond ten Geographical Miles :

4 And whereas the Method for finding the Longitude at Sea, within half a Degree of a Great Circle, or

4 thirty Geographical Miles, by Means of the said Watch or Time Keeper invented by the said Jfohn

4 Harrison, may be made^generally practicable, and of general Utility, if the Principles upon which the

4 said Watch or Time Keeper is conflru&cd are fully discovered and explained, and other Watches or

4 Time Keepers of the fame Kind can be made : But Doubts may arise whether, by the Words of the

4 said A& of the twelfth of Queen Anne, the said Commissioners can direct the Payment of the said Rc-

4 ward of twenty thousand Pounds to the said John Harrison, upon a Discovery of the Principles of the

4 said Watch or Time Keeper, and upon other Watches or Time Keepers of the fame Kind being made:

4 And whereas great Progress has been made towards discovering the Longitude at Sea by a Set of Lunar

4 Tables conflrudled by Tchiat Mayer dccensed, late Professor at Goctingcn in Germany, upon the Principles

4 of Gravitation laid dowtv by Sir Isaac Newton; in the Conftruflion of which Tables he was conlide-

4 tfably assisted from Theorems furnished by Professor Euler of the University of Berlin : And whereas the

4 said Tables are of considerable Use to the Publick, and may be further improved, and made of more

4 general Utility: And whereas the Widow, or other Representativcs of the said Professor Mayer, are,

4 within the Intention of the said Act, deserving of a publick Reward, upon her or their aligning; the

4 Property of the said Tables to the said Commissioners for the Use of the Publick ; and the said Professor

4 Euler is also deserving of an honorary and pecuniary Acknowledgment for his useful and ingenious

4 Labours towards the Discovery of the Longitude : And whereas it is neccessary that the Powers of the

4 said Act of the twelfth Year of Queen Anne, and also of the said Act of the twenty-sixth Year of King

4 George the Second, should be explained and made effectual, as well for receiving the Discovery and Ex-

• planation of the Principles upon which the said Watch or Time Keeper is conllrudled, and for making

4 Trial of other Watches or "rime Keepers to be made in Consequence thereof, and for paying the said I

4 Reward to the said John Harrison, his Executors, Administrators, or Assigns, as for giving proper Re-

4 wards to the said Professor Euler, and to the Widow or Representativcs of the said Professor Mayer%

4 and to such Person or Persons as {hall improve the said Tables of the Moon, and make the fame of

4 more general Utility; and also to such Person or Persons as shall make other Discoveries or Improve-

4 ments useful to Navigation May it therefore please your Majesty/*. that it may be enabled ; and he it

enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords

Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament afTerrtbled, and by the Authority of

10,0001. to be the fame, That one Moiety of the grenteft Reward which is directed in and by the said Act, made in the

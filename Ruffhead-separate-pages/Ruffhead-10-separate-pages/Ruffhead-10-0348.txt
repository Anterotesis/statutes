and to enable his Majesty to grant Letters Patent for cilablilhing a '1 hcarre in the City of

Edinburgh, or Suburbs thereof.

WHEREAS by an Act of Parliament passed in the twenty-sixth Year of the Rc’211 of his late Ma-

jeiiy King George the Second, intituled, An Act for netting fevered f ubiick Bui am ^ in the City of

4 Edinburgh, mid to impower the Trustees therein mentioned to purcheife Land* Jor that Pu. gr/t; and also for

4 widening and enlarging the Streets cj the said City, ana certain Avenues leading thereunto; it 15 enabled, That

4 certain Persons therein named as Trustees, o: any seven of them, {hall have full Power and Authority to

4 agree with the Owners and Occupiers of Rich Houses as lie on the North Side of the High Street of the

4 said City; and having purchased the fame, to order the said Houses to be pulled down, and the Ground

4 or Area to be employed in such Manner as the said Trustees shall appoint, for rendering Access to the

4 said City and High Street thereof more easy and commodious: And whereas the said Trustees, in Execu-

4 tion of the Powers vested in them by the said Act, did erect an Exchange near the Centre of the City 5

and did afterwards pay over the Balance of the Monies then remaining in their Hands, which amounted

4 to three thousand Pounds Sterling, or thereabouts, to the Magistrates and Council, to be applied for

4 rendering Access to the City more easy and commodious: And whereas the extending the Limits of the

4 City of Edinburgh has been found necessary, as well for the Benefit of Trade and Commerce, as for the

4 Conveniency and Health of the Inhabitants, who are of late greatly increased: And whereas the Lord

4 Provost, Magistrates, and Council of the said City, as well in farther Execution of the before-recited

4 Act, as in View to the Extension aforesaid, have expended large Sums of Money in purchasing Houses

and Areas on the North Side of the High Street of the said City, and in building a Bridge, whereby an

4 easy and proper Communication will be opened to the City: And whereas the Grounds after mentioned

4 are without the Royalty of the said City; and it being just and reasonable that the Royalty of the said

4 City lliould be extended over those Grounds, irr Consideration of the great Expence the City has been and

4 will be put to in building the said Bridge, and making the Communication and Access to the City other—

4 wife easy; and for the equal apportioning of publick Burdens and Benefits, and Administration of Justice

4 amongst all the real Inhabitants of the PlUce: But as this salutary Purpose cannot be accomplished with—

4 out the Authority of Parliament, and as the Proprietors of the several Parcels of Ground after-mention-

4 ed, have either consented, or are bound by their Titles to consent, that their respective Lands shall be

4 included within the Royalty of the City of Edinburgh; your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal Subjects,

the Lord Provost, Magistrates and Council of the City of Edinburgh, on Behalf of themselves and Com-

4 muniiy of the said City, do therefore most humbly beseech your Majesty, that it may be enacted afld be

it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiri-

tual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the

4 XXIII. And whereas by an Act of Parliament made and passed in the fifth Year of the Rei*n of her

4 late Majesty Queen Anney intituled, An Act for an Union of the tiuo Kingdoms of England and Scotland

4 it is, by the eighteenth Article of the said Act of Union, declared and enacted, That the Laws concern-

4 ing Regulation of Trade, Customs, and such Excises to which Scotland is, by virtue of this Treaty, made

the said Act of Union, it is also declared-and enacted, That all Parts of the United Kingdom be, for

4 ever, from and after the Union, liable to the fame Excises upon all exciseable Liquors; excepting only

that the thirty-four Gallons English Barrel of Beer or Ale, amounting to twelve Gallons Scots present

4 Measure, fold in Scotland at nine Shillings and six Pence Sterling, excluding all Duties, and retailed,

4 including Duties, at twoPence the Scotch Pint, or eighth Part of the Scotch Gallon* be not after the

4 Union liable, on account of the present Excise upon exciseable Liquors in England, to any higher Im-

1 position than two Shillings Sterling upon the aforesaid thirty-four Gallons English Barrel, being twelve

4 Gallons the present Scots Measure; yet nevertheless Doubts have been raised whether the Brewers of that

4 particular Species of Beer or Ale mentioned and described in the said seventh Article of the said Treaty

4 of Union, and commonly called and known by the Name of Two Penny Beer or Aley are within the De-

4 feription and Meaning of an Act of Parliament made and passed in the seventh and eighth Years of the

4 Reign of King William the Third, intituled, An Act for laying several Duties upon Low IVines or Spirits

4 of the first Extraction; and for preventing the Frauds and Abuses of Brewers, Distillers, and other Persons

4 chargeable with the Duties of Excise; and by reason of such Doubts, great Frauds and Abuses have been,

and are, daily committed and made by the Brewers of such Beer or Ale, which is generally called Two

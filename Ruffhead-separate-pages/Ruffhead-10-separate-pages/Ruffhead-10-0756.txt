Sixth and Tenth Year$ of the Reign of Queen Anne, and in the Seventh Year of the

Reign of King George the First, for repairing the Harbour and Key of Watchett, in the

County of Somerset.

WHEREAS by an Act of Parliament of the Sixth Year of the Reign of Hr late Majesty Queen

Anne, intituled, An ATI for repairing the Harbour and Key of Watchett, in the County s/'Somerset,

4 it was enacted, That from and after the Five and Twentieth Day of March, One thousand seven hun-

4 dred and eight, for the Term of One-and-twenty Years, and from thence to the End of the then next

Seihon of Parliament, there should be paid the several Rates and Duties in the said Act mentioned and

x expressed, for all Goods and Merchandizes exported, shipped, or laden, or discharged at or within the

4 said Harbour or Key; and also the several Duties of Tonnage and Keelage for Ships, Hoys, Barks, and

4 Vessels, which, during the said Term, should come into the said Harbour for Security and Preservation

4 (the said Port or Harbour not being their discharging Port); and after the Expiration of the said Term

4 of One-and-twenty Years, One Half of the said Rates and Duties by the said Act granted on the fevc-

4 ral Goods and Merchandizes therein mentioned, was to continue to be collected for ever, in order for

the raising a sufficient Stock and Supply for keeping the said Harbour and Key in good Repair: And

4 whereas by a Clause in another Act of Parliament passed in the Tenth Year of Her said late Majesty’s

4 Reign, intituled, An Act for prolonging the Term for Payment of certain Duties granted by an Act made in

the Twelfth and Thirteenth Years of his late Majesty King William, intituled, An Act for recovering, fe-

4 curing, and keeping in Repair the Harbour of Minehead, for the Benefit and Support of the Navigation

and Trade of this Kingdom, it was enacted, That all Goods shipped or discharged at a Place called

4 The Blue Anchor or Cleave Steps, or other Places adjoining to the said Harbour and Key of Watchett,

4 should be chargeable with the Duties, as if the Go;>ds had been shipped or discharged within the said

4 Harbour or Key of Watchett: And whereas by an Act of the Seventh Year of the Reign of His Majesty

4 King George the First, intituled, An ATI for continuing the Duties granted by several ATls made in the

4 Sixth and Tenth Years of Her late Maje/lys Reign, for repairing the Harbour ana Key of Watchett, in the

4 County of Somerset, the several Rates and Duties by the said Act, passed in the Sixth Year of Her said

4 late Majesty’s Reign, granted and made payable for the said T erm of Twenty-one Years, were, from

and after the Expiration of the said Term, charged upon and made payable for the several Goods and

4 Merchandizes, and also the.Tonnage and Keelage ot Ships and Vessels (in the said Act particularly

4 mentioned and expressed) for and during the further Term of Twenty-one Years, to be computed from

the Expiration of the said former Term granted by the said Act of the Sixth Year of Her said late Ma-

4 jelly’s Reign: And whereas it hath been lately discovered that the Term limited by the said last men-

4 tioned Act, for colleCling such of the said Rates and Duties (the Grant whereof was temporary only)

4 did expire on the Tw’enty-fifth Day of March, in the Year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred

and fifty; but that through Ignorance of such Expiration, the Whole of the said Rates and Duties hath

4 been continued to be collected and applied as before: And whereas the said Harbour and Key, soon

4 after the passing the first mentioned Act, were repaired, and a large Pier erected at a very great, and the

4 folc Cost and ETxpence of Sir William Wyndham Baronet, Grandfather to George now Earl of Egrea out;

and the fame Harbour, Key, and Pier have ever since been repaired and supported by the said Sir William

4 Windham, C arlcs late Earl of Egremont, and George now Earl of Egremont> Lords of the said Manor of

Watchett, for the Security of theahips and Vessels riding in the said Harbour, and the Preservation of the

4 said Town and the Inhabitants thereof from the Inroads of the Sea, at a great annual Expence: And

4 whereas it hath been found, by long Experience, that such of the said Rates and Duties, the Grant

4 whereof was made perpetual to the Lords of the said Manor so long as they should repair the said Harbour,

4 have not proved, nor are likely to be sufficient to defray the current Expences of the Repairs and other

4 incident Charges: And whereas, besides the ordinary Reparations now wanting, some further new

4 Works will likewise be requisite for the better securing the Pier from the Violence of the Sea, which there

4 rages in a very extraordinary Manner 5 nor can any efteftual Provision be made to guard against and remedy

4 unforeseen Accidents, without a constant Stock and Supply of Money for that Purpose: Wherefore, May

4 it nleafe Your most Excellent Majesty, that it maybe enacted; and’be it enacted by the King’s

most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and

Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That all Personal

Actions and Suits, Indiftinents, Informations, and all rrofecutions and Proceedings whatsoever which

have been or shall be prosecuted or commenced against any Person or Persons for or by reason of the Re-

ceipt, Collection, Application or Disposition of such of the Rates and Duties in the said recited Acts,

any or either of them, mentioned (being One Moiety or Half Part of the Rates and Duties in the said

Acts mentioned) the Grant whereof was temporary, and expired as aforesaid, at any l ime from and since

the said Twenty-fifth Day of March, which was in the Year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred

and fifty, or for or by reason of any Act, Matter, or Thing whatsoever done or performed in or about

the Premises, are and shall be discharged and made void by virtue of this Act; and if any Action or Suit

shall be commenced or prosecuted against any Person or Persons for or by reason of the Receipt, Collection,

Application, or Disposition of such Moiety or Half Part of the said Rates and Duties in the said Acts

mentioned.

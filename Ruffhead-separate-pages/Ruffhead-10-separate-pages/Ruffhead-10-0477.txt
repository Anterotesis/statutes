4 XLIX. And whereas by the said Act of the fifteenth Year of King Charles the Second, it was, amongst i^Car. a. c. iy,

4 other Things, enacted, That the Governor, Bailiffs, and Conservators of the said Great Level, should

c have Power to lay Taxes upon the ninety-five thousand Acres of Land (allotted as a Recompence for the

* Draining of the said Great Level) for the Support, Maintenance, and Preservation of the said Great

4 Level, and to levy the same, with Penalties for Non-payment; and that the said Governor, Bailiffs, and

4 Conservators, should have Power to fell so much of such Parts and Proportions of the said ninety-five

4 thousand Acres, upon which any Tax shall be in Arrear, or Penalties, in such Proportions as the said

4 Governor, Bailiffs, and Conservators, should judge to be sufficient to raise such Taxes and Penalties:

* And whereas several Parcels of the said ninety-five thousand Acres of Land lying within the District A &» for Bed fort

4 herein before described, were, at different Times, put up to Sale, in pursuance, and according to, the Level rcaled*

4 Directions of the before-recited Act of the fifteenth of King Charles the Second, intituled, An Act for

4 the Taxing and Assessing of the Lands of the Adventurers within the Great Level of the Fensy in order to raise

4 the Taxes and Penalties in Arrear for and in respect of the said Lands ; but the fame^iot being thought

4 worth the Taxes and Penalties due thereon, such Lands could not be fold so as to raise such Penalties

4 and Taxes; and the said Governor, Bailiffs, and Conservators, havingdirefted their Officers, from time

4 to time, to bid for such Lands as could not be sold for the Amount of the Taxes and Penalties respectively

4 due thereon, they the said Officers became the Purchasers of such Lands, and have either conveyed the

4 fame to the said Governor, Bailiffs, and Commonalty, or declared such Purchasers to have been made in

4 Trust for the said Corporation; and the Lands so purchased have, ever ftnee such Purchases respectively

4 made thereof, remained vested in the said Corporation, and are called lnvefted Lands, and have been an-

4 nually rated and assessed to the Taxes laid upon the said ninety-five thousand Acres, according to their

4 respective Proportions, in pursuance of the said Acts of the fifteenth and twentieth of King Charles the

4 Second ; but such Taxes not having been raised or paid, the said Corporation have, from time to time,

4 let such lnvefted Lands, or such Parts of them as they could find Tenants for, at such Rents as could be

4 procured for the fame; but the Profits arising from the Lands so let have been very small and inconsidera-

4 ble, and much less than the Taxes with which such Lands have been assessed : And whereas it will bfe

4 for the Benefit of the said Corporation that the said Inverted Lands should be sold for the best Price that

4 can be got for the fame, discharged of all Arrears of Taxes assessed, or to be assessed, thereon, before

4 the said Lands shall be fold, by virtue of the said Acts of the fifteenth and twentieth Years of King

4 Charles the Second, but subject nevertheless in like Manner, as the rest of the said ninety-five thousand

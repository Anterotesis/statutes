4 it is, amongst other Things, enacted, That if any common Brewer shall, at any Time after the tenth Day

4 of April, which was in the Year of our Lord one thousand six hundred and ninety-seven, without Notice

4 first given at the next Office, erect or set up any Tun, Batch, Float, Cooler, or Copper, or shall alter

by it is very difficult, and sometimes imprfible for the Gauger or Officer to ascertain the true Dips, and

Rectal ofciause 4 JfXVI. And whereas by a Clause in an Act of Parliament passed in the eighteenth Year of the Reign

in Act 18 Geo. « of h|s ]ate Majesty King George the Second, intituled, An Act for repealing the present Inland Duty of

a. c. 26. < Shillings per Pound Weight upon all Tea fold in Great Britain, and for granting to his IWajesty certain

4 other Inland Duties in lieu thereof; and for the better securing the Duty upon Teay and other Duties of Excise 5

and for pursuing Offenders out of one County into another: \ reciting. That whereas by the Lgws then in force

4 concerning the Duties of Excise, and other Duties under the Management of the Commissioners of Ex-

4 cife, in that Part of Great Britain called England, all Forfeitures and Offences made and committed

4 within the immediate Limits of the Chief Office in London, were to be heard, adjudged and determined,

4 by the Chief Commissioners and Governors of Excise; and all such Forfeitures and Offences made and

4 committed within aH or any other the Counties, Cities, Towns or Places, in England, were to be heard

' 4 and determined, by any two or more of the Justices of the Poacc, residing near to the Place where such

4 Forfeitures shall be made, or Offence committed; and reciting also, that many Persons chargeable with

4 Duties of Excise, or other Duties under the Management of the said Commissioners, or incurring Penal-

4 ties by Offences against the said Laws, did frequently avoid Prosecutions for the fame, by removing out of

the Jurisdiction wherein such Duties were charged, or Offence committed, to the great Prejudice of the

4 Revenue, and Discouragement of the fair Traders: For Remedy whereof, it was by the said Act enacted,

4 That from aiyj after the twenty-fourth Day of June> one thousand seven hundred and forty-five, it

4 should and might be lawful for the said Commissioners and Justices respectively within whose Jurisdiction

' 4 any Person charged with any of the Duties, or who should have committed any Offence against the said

4 Laws, or any of them, or against the said Act, should be found, to summon, hear, adjudge, and de-

termine, and issue any Process or Warrant, in the same Manner as such Commissioners might then do,

in case of such Offences as were committed within their respective Jurisdictions; and in case the said

4 Commissioners or Justices should, upon any Judgment given by them respectively, issue a Warrant or

4 Warrants of Distress, and the Person or Persons authorized to execute such Warrant, or any of them,

4 should make a Return thereto, that no sufficient Distress could be found, then it should and might be

lawful for, the said Commissioners and Justices respectively, within whose Jurisdiction the Party should at

4 any Time be found against whom such Warrant should have been ilfaed, upon producing to them such

4 Warjintand Return thereof, to commit such Offender to the next County Goal, till Satisfaction should

4 be ffiade: And whereas, since the passing of the said Clause, divers other Rates and Duties of Excise,

and other Rates and Duties, have by virtue of several Acts of Parliament been put under the Management

4 of the respective Commissioners of Excise in England and Scotland; and it is proper that the Provisions in

the last recited Clause should be extended to all and every Law and Laws concerning the Duties of Excise,

Mouth of the Humber, upon a very broad lone Sand, thrown up and discovered about fix pr seven

Months then since, by reason whereof they failed in great Danger in the Night ; and considering that

Lights erected upon the Spurn Pointy at the Mouth of the Humber, would for die future prevent such

Danger, they applied to JustiwAn Angell of London, Merchant, he being Proprietor of a Piece of

Ground fit for such Purpose; and proposed, that if he would ere A two Lights upon the said Ground,

they would contribute to pay him, towards the Charges and Maintenance thereof, one Farthing a Ton;

and reciting, that the said Justinian Angell had accordingly erected two Lights, which the said Petition*

ers found to be of great Buiefit, and an absolute Safety to all Navigators on that Coast, there being no

Ground upon all the Coast that any Light could be erected upon to do any Service to the Navigators,

tending to the aforesaid Sands and Harbour, but the aforesaid Place; therefore they prayed ‘ his laid

Majesty to grant to the said Justinian Angell full Power to kindle and maintain the said Lighto ; and

the Matter, Wardens, Affiftams, and Elder Brethren, of the Trinity House of Newcastle, having exa-

mined, and certified to his said Majesty, the Necessity of the said Lights, and that the fame would be of

great Benefit to Navigation, his said Majesty, for promoting and continuing so good a Work, and for

the Safety of his Subjects, was pleased to grant to the said Justinian Angell, his Heirs and Assigns, full

and free Liberty and Authority to continue, renew, and maintain, the said Light-houses with Lights, to

be continually burning therein in the Night Season, whereby the said Ships might the better come to

their Ports without Peril 5 and for defraying the necessary Charges and conttant Maintenance of the said

Light-houses, his said Majesty was pleased to declare and grant, that for ever thereafter there might be

take, for every Ship or Vessel patting by the said Light-house, and belonging or trading to the Ports of

NewcajUe or Sunderland, or any of the Creeks or Members thereof, one Farthing the Ton, according to

the Burthen of such Ships or Vessels; to hold the said Liberties, Powers, and Authorities, Contribu-

tions, Duties, and Sums of Money, to the said Justinian Angell, his Heirs and Assigns for ever, as fully,

to all Intents and Purposes, as the Matters of the Trinity House at Deptford Strond in Kent, or any other

Person or Persons, any the like Licences, Powers, and Authorities, then had, held, or enjoyed, or might

have, hold, or enjoy, in any other Place or Places, subject to the yearly Rent of five Pounds, in Man-

ner in the said Letters Patent mentioned; and his Majesty was also pleased thereby to grant divers other

Powers and Authorities relative to the collecting and receiving the said Duties; W in the said Letter*

Patent it is provided, that if at any Time thereafter it should be made appear to his said Majesty, his

Heirs or Successors, that such Grant was prejudicial or inconvenient, or not of publick Use or Benefit,

then, upon Signification or Declaration to be made by his said Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, under

his or their Signet or Privy Seal, of such Prejudice or Inconvenience, the said Letters Patent were to

be void and determine : And whereas by certain other Letters Patent, bearing Date at tPeftminster the

fourteenth Day of June, in the thirtieth Year of the Reign of his said late Majesty, reciting (among

other Things) that the said Justinian Angell having complained to the Petitioners, in the said Letters Pa-

tent named, that the said Receipt of one Farthing a Ton would not maintain the said Light-houses,

they had considered the Charge of maintaining the said Light-house, and of the other Light by hipi

since erected and added, and that the said Petitioners had requested his said Majesty to grant a further

Duty for the Maintenance of the said Lights ; his said Majesty, for the necessary Charges and conftarit

Maintenance of the said Light-houses, was pleased to declare and grant, that, for ever thereafter, there

whe ther outward or homeward bound, and belonging and trading to any of the Ports and Creeks afore-

said, or any ways Northward, the further and additional Sum of one Farthing a Ton, more than he

ought to receive by virtue of the said first-mentioned Letters Patent, for all English Ships orVellcls;

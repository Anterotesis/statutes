foners within the said Gaols, who may'at any Time be inclined and willing to work; and for that Pur-

pose are hereby authorised, at a General or Quarter Session of the Peace for the said County, or at any Ad-

journment thereof, to direct the Payment of such Sums of Money out of the County Rate for the said

County as they shall from Time to Time think fit to be expended in executing the Provision of the said

last-mentioned Act, according to the Extension thereof hereby made.

* XIII. And whereas, by an Act of the fourteenth Year of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, intituled,

c An Act how Vagabonds shall be punishcdy and the Poor relieved, as also by the above-mentioned Act of the

c thirty-second Year of the Reign of King George the Second, some Provision is made for the Relief of

* Prisoners; but, notwithstanding the humane Purposes thereby intended, the Health of Prisoners is fre-

4 quently so affected, by Want of necessary Food, as to render them incapable of Labour when released,

c and therefore it may be expedient to have a more extensive Provision in favour of such poor Prisoners

c as shall be confined in the said Gaols and other Places of Confinement, and have not any Means of ac-

quiring necessary Sustenance Be it therefore enacted, That, from and after the passing of this Act, it

shall be lawful for the Justices of the Peace, at their General or Quarter Sessions, or any Adjournment

thereof, from Time to Time to order such Sum or Sums of Money to be paid out of the County Rate,

towards assisting such Prisoners, of every Description, as, being confined within the said Gaols or other

Places of Confinement, are not able to work, or being able, cannot procure Employment sufficient to

sustain themselves by their Industry, or who may not be otherwise provided for by virtue of any Law or

Statute, or of any Custom, or Order, such Food and Raiment as the said Justices shall, from Time to

Time, think necessary for the Support of Health ; and such Money shall accordingly be applied, in con-

formity to Directions to be given by the said Justices.

XIV. And be it further enacted, That if the said Visitors shall at any Time observe, or be satisfactorily

informed of any extraordinary Diligence or Merit in any of the Offenders under their Infpcction, they shall

report the fame to the Justices of Oyer and Terminer and Gaol Delivery, or Great Sessions, at their next

or any subsequent Session to be holden for the County in which such OHender was convicted, in order that

such Justices may, if they shall think proper, recommend such Offender to the Royal Mercy, in such De-

gree or upon such Terms as to them shall seem meet, and if his Adajesty shall thereupon be graciously

pleased to shorten the Duration of such Offenderâ€™s Confinement, such Offender shall, together with nc-

cessary Cloathing, receive such Sum of Money for his or her immediate Subsistence, as the said visiting

Justices shall think proper, so as such Sum shall not exceed twenty Shillings, nor be less than five Shillings,

in cale such Offender shall have been confined for the Space of one Year, and so in Proportion for any

shorter 'Perm of Confinement; and such Sums of Money, as also the Expence of such Cloathing, shall be

paid out of the County Rate.

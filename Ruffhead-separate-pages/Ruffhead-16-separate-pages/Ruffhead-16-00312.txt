4 by the several Parties thereto; (that is to say,) an Agreement on the Part of the Apprentice, that he will

4 faithfully serve his Matter during the Term of such Apprenticeship; and also lcvcral Covenants on the

4 Part of the Matter, for himlelt, his Executors and Administrators, that he the said Matter will teach or

4 caule to be taught, such Apprentice in the Business of Husbandry, or in the Craft, Mystery, or Occu-

4 pation which such Matter then uleth, as the Cafe may be; and that such Matter shall also, during the

4 Term of such Apprenticeship, find and allow unto such Apprentice sufficient Meat, Drink, Apparel,

4 Lodging, and ail other Things needful for an Apprentice, during such Term: And whereas, in the

4 Event of the Death of the Matter during the Term of such Apprenticeship, the Agreement for Service

4 on the Part of the Apprentice is at an End, but the Covenant for Maintenance on the Part of the Maf-

4 ter ftiil continues in Force, as far as the Matter’s Assets will extend, or Doubts h ue arisen with respect

4 thereto, and, in consequence thereof, such Apprentices do frequently, on the Death of their Mailer,

4 leave their Matter’s House, and, after living in idleness, return again and become a Burden on their

4 Matter’s Effects, and so from Time to Time as they think proper, which is attended with great Inconre-

4 nience and Hardship to the Family and Personal Representatives of such Matter, and is at the fame Time

4 an Inducement to such Apprentice to continue in a diforderly and idle Course of Life: And whereas the

4 several Powers given to Justices of the Peace for the better ordering of Parish Apprentices, by the fe-

4 veral Acts of Parliament made for that Purpose, do ceale and determine on the Death of the Matter, for

4 which a Remedy ought to be provided: And whereas several other Regulations aie necessary to be made

4 respecting Parish Apprentices:’ Be itjtherefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent.Majesty, by and.

with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parlia-

ment assembled, and by the Authority of the same, 'I’hat, from and after the first Day of July one thou-

sand lbven hundred and ninety-two, in case of the Death of any Master or Mistress of any Parish Appren-

tice, during the Term of such Apprenticeship, upon the binding out of which Apprentice no larger Sum

than five Pounds has been or shall be paid, such Covenant as is before mentioned, for the Maintenance of

such Apprentice, inserted in the Indenture of Apprenticeship by which such Apprentice shall have

been or shall be bound, shall not continue and be in F orce for and during any longer Time than for three

Calendar Months next after the Death of such Master or Mistress, and that during such three Calendar

Months such Apprentice shall continue to live with and serve as an Apprentice, the Executors and Admini-

strators of such Master or Mistress, some or one of them, or such Periori or Persons as such Executors or

Administrators, some or one of them, shall appoint; and the Master or Mistress whom such Apprentice

shall accordingly serve during the said three Calendar Months, and also such Apprentice, shall during that.

Time be subject and liable to all the Laws which are or shall be in Force for the better Government and

Regulation of Matters and Parish Apprentices: And that in all such Parish Indentures of Apprenticeship

as aforesaid, which shall be made from and after the first Day of July one thousand seven hundred and nine-

ty-two, there shall be annexed to the Covenant in such Indentures to be entered into on the Part of the

Master or Mistress of such Apprentice, for such Maintenance as aforesaid, a Proviso declaring, that such

Covenant shall not be made to continue and be in Force for any longer Time than for three Calendar

Months next after the Death of such Master or Mistress, in case such Master or Mistress shall die during,

the Term of such Apprenticeship; which Proviso may be in the Form or to the Effedt mentioned in the

Schedule hereunto annexed, marked with the Letter A; and in case such Proviso shall happen to be omitted

in any such Indenture, the Covenant therein contained on the Part of the Matter, for the Maintenance of

the Apprentice, shall be deemed and taken to continue and be in Force for no longer Time than for three

Calendar Months next after the Death of such Master or Mistress, in case such Master or Mistress shall die.

during the Term of such Apprenticeship; any Thing in any such Covenant to the contrary notwith-

Handing.

II. And whereas it is just and reasonable, that such Apprentice as aforesaid, in case of his Matter’s*

4 Death during his Apprenticeship, should be obliged, during the Term of his Apprenticeship, to make

4 some Satisfaction by his Labour to the Family or Representatives of his deceased Matter, for the Advan-

4 tages he has received from his Apprenticeship in his Childhood, when his Services could not be equal to

the Expences of his Maintenance;’ be it enacted, That within such three Calendar Months after the

Death of such Master or Mistress, it shall and may be lawful for any two Justices of the Peace of the

County, City, Town, Riding, Division, or Place where such Master or Mistress shall have died, on Appli-

cation made to them by the Widow of such Matter, or by the Husband of such Mistress, or by any Son or

Daughter, Brother or Sitter, or by any Executor or Executrix, Administrator or Administratrix, of such

Master or Mistress, by Indorsement on any such Indenture of Apprenticeship, or the Counterpart thereof,

or by any other Instrument in Writing, (which Indorsement or instrument may be in the Forms or to the

Effect mentioned in the Schedule hereunto annexed marked with the Letters B. and C.,) to order and direct

that such Apprentice shall serve as an Apprentice any one of such Persons so making such Application as

aforesaid (such Person having lived with, and having been Part of the F amily of, such Matter or Millreis

at the Time of his or tier Death) as the said Justices shall in their Discretion think fit, for and during the Re-

fidue of the Term mentioned in such Indenture of Apprenticeship; and the Person obtaining such Order

shall declare his Acceptance of such Apprentice, by subscribing his or her Name to such Order; and that

from and after such Order shall be made, the Executors and Administrators, and the Personal Abets,

Estate, and Effedls of the Master or Mistress so dying as aforesaid, shall be released and discharged of and

from any Protnile or Covenant whatsoever, contained in any such Indenture of Apprenticeship, oa the

Part of such Master or Mistress, his or her Executors or Administrators, to be done and performed; and

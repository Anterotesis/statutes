9 nistrators, and Assigns, for the Term of fourteen Years, the lole Benefit and Advantage of a Machine or

c of Woollen Cloths, ar$ other Articles, with a Proviso in each of the said Letters Patent, that he {hould,by

9 Writing under his Hand and Seal, cause a particular Description of the Nature of his said Invention to be

9 inrolled in the Court of Chancery of Great Britain, and also in the Chancellary of that Part of Great

9 Britain called Scotland, within four Months after the Date of the said recited Letters Patent: And whereas

9 there is Reason to apprehend, that if the said particular Description of his said Invention be so inrolled in

the said Court of Chancery, and in the said Chancellary, Copies thereof will be obtained by Foreign Agents

9 and Emilfories, and transmitted to Foreign Countries, the Inhabitants of which will thereby have the Be-

9 nefit of making use of the said Invention before his Majesty’s Subjects in Great Britain can by Law make

9 use of the fame; which would not only prevent the Patentee from deriving the full Advantage which he has

4 Reason to expert therefrom, but might also tend to diminish the Woollen Trade of this Kingdom :9 May it

therefore please your Majesty, that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Ma-

jesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this pre-

sent Parliament ailembled, and by the Authority of the same. That instead of causing the said particular De-

4 that the Person or Persons taking such Oath shall reside in such City or Town, and for a limited Time

withip the Meaning of the said Act: And whereas Robert Claxton of Bristol, Merchant, is a Native of the

« Island of Saint Ch> i/lopher's in the IVejl Indies, where he was brought up in the mercantile Line, and car-

« ried on an extensive Business as a Merchant for a considerable Length of Time, and until the Year one

« thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, when he quitted that Istand, and came to England, and hath

« ever since re Tided in the City of Bristol, of which he is a Freeman: And whereas, in the Year one thou-

« sand seven hundred and seventy-seven, the said Robert Claxtcn did become a Citizen, Burgher, or Inhabit-

4 ant of the Island of Saint Enflatius, and did thereupon take the ufaal Oath of Allegiance to the States of

4 take the several Oaths aforesaid for the sole Purpose of enabling him to acquire the Rights of a Citizen,

Burgher, or Inhabitant of the said Dutch Island of Saint Eiijlatius, and of the said Danish Island of Saint

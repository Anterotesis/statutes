termination of the Justices in Session or Adjournment {hall be final to all Intents and Purposes, unless the

the Objections why such Debtor’s Discharge is refused by them; and in all Cafe$ whatever, it shall and

may be lawful to and for the Justices, at any subsequent Session or Adjournment, upon Application from

the Prisoner, upon due Proof on Oath made to them, by two or more credible Witnesses, (which Oath

they are hereby empowered to administer,) of each Objection or Objections being removed, and on Proof

of Notice served, at least ten Days previous to such Application, on the Creditor or Creditors who before

opposed his Discharge, and of Notice likewise inserted in the Gazette, in Manner before directed by this Act,

4 bar, either by levying a Fine or Fines, suffering a Common Recovery or Common Recoveries, or by Sur-

4 ments, or Hereditaments would be liable to the Payment of their Debts, and be delivered up, according

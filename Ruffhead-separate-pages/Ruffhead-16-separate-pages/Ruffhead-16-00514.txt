C. 74. Anno tricesimo tertio Georgii III. A.I>. 1793;

XLVIII. And be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That in case at the Meeting held immediately

after the second Examination of the Bankrupt, he or his Friends shall make a Proposal of Composition 16

tl»e Creditors, and shall offer Caution to the Satisfaction of Nine-tenths of them, both in Number and Va-

lue, ailembled at the said Meeting, for such Composition upon his whole Debts as the said Nine-tenths in

Number and Value so assembled shall think just and reasonable, the Trustee shall appoint another Meeting for

the Purpose of deciding upon such Offer, at the Distance of not less than three Weeks thereafter, and of

which Meeting he shall give Notice by advertising the fame twice in the said Newspaper a Fortnight at lead

before the proposed Meeting, speccifying the Time and Place, and Purpose of the Meeting, but in the mean

Time he (hull proceed in executing his Duty as Trustee in the fame Way as if no such Proposition had been

made; and if at the Meeting so appointed it shall be the Opinion of Nine-tenths of the Creditors there afiem-

bled, both in Number and Value, that the Offer should be accepted of, a Report of the Proceedings rela-

tive thereto shall be forthwith made up by the Trustee, and transmitted to the Clerk of the Sequestration in

the Court of Session, for the Approbation of the Court; and if the Court, upon hearing any Objections that

may be stated by opposing Creditors, shall find the Proposition reasonable, and that the fame has been af-

lented to not only by Nine-tenths in Number and Value of the Creditors who attended by themselves or

others authorized by them at the Meeting last mentioned, but Nine-tenths of all the Creditors who have pro-

duced Grounds of Debt or interests, and Oaths of Verity, an Act or Order shall be pronounced to that

Effect, and the Bond of Caution, which must be previously lodged in the Clerk’s Hands, shall then be given

up to the Trustee fur Behoof of the Creditors, the whole Expence attending the Sequestration being at the

fame Time paid or provided for, to the Satisfaction of the Court, by the Bankrupt or his Friends; after which

all Proceedings in the Sequestration shall cease, and the said Act or Order shall declare the Trustee exonerated,

and the Bankrupt discharged, except as to Payment of the Composition.

XLIX. And whereas it has too frequently happened that Sequestrations have been obstructed, and much '

4 Expence, Litigation, and Delay occasioned by collusive and ineffectual Plans of Composition concerted be-

c tween the Bankrupt and particular Creditors be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That every Pro-

posal or Agreement for a Composition with individual Creditors, or to stop the Proceedings in the Sequef-

tration, other than as hereby expressly authorized and allowed, shall be deemed illegal and void, and all Per-

fons concerned in them shall be liable to be complained of to the Court cf Session, at the Instance of 2ny

Party having Interest, and made answerable for all Consequences; and if it shall be proved that any Credi-

for has privately accepted of a Gratuity, or higher Composition, for giving his Concurrence to the Mea-

sures proposed on Behalf of the Bankrupt or his Friends, he shall forfeit his Debt, and be liable in Reftitu-

tien of what he has received, which shall go into the General Fund of Division; and the Bankrupt himself

shall, if required, make Oath that there has been no such private Transaction or Compromise between him.

and any of the Creditors, and that he has used 110 undue Influence with any of them to obtain their Con-

currence.

L. And be it hereby enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That in case no Proposal of Composition is made

at the Time, and in the Manner before specified, or in case the fame, when made, shall become ineffectual, no

other Proposal of a similar Nature shall be attended to by the Truffee, or be cf any Effect, unless Proof is

made that the fame has been assented to by every Creditor, without Exception; but after the Period assigned

for the second Dividend, it shall be lawful for the Bankrupt, with Concurrence of the T ruftee, and Four-fifths

of the Creditors in Number and Value, to apply to the Court of Session by Petition, praying that he may be

held as finally discharged of all his Debts contrafted before the Application for Sequeffration, and this Peti-

tien, being intimated upon the Wall, and in the Newspaper before mentioned, the Court shall, at the Distance

of not less than three Calendar Months thereafter, resume the Consideration thereof, and if no Objection is

made, they shall pronounce an Act or Order in Terms of the Prayer of the Petition; but if Appearance is

made by any of the Creditors, objefting that the Discharge ought not to be granted on Account of the Bank-

rupt’s not having made a fair Dilcovcry and Surrender of his Estate, or that he has refuted to grant a Dif-

position to the Trustee, as ordered by the Court, or has wilfully been absent from the Diets of Examination,

or has been guilty of any Collusion, or that his Bankruptcy did not arise from innocent Misfortunes, or Lodes

in Business, but from culpable or undue Conduct, the Court shall judge of these Objections, and allow a

Proof of them, if thought necessary, and shall either grant or refuse the Discharge, or annex such Conditions

thereto as the Nature and Justice of the Cafe may require, the Bankrupt always taking an Oath before the

Court, or upon Commission, when Judgement is pronounced in his Favour, and before the Act can be ex-

tracted, that he has faithfully complied with all the Kcquilites of the Statute, and has used no undue Influence,

nor had Recourse to any lecrct Compromise with his Creditors, or any of them, to obtain their Concurrence;

and if it shall appear that there has been any such private Transaction between the Bankrupt and any of his

Creditors, the fame is hereby declared to be unlawful, and no Action shall lie upon any Bill or other Security

granted in consequence thereof.

LI. And whereas it may be reasonable that the Bankrupt should have fomc Allowance out of the Estate

4 for supporting himself and his Family, while the Trustee may have Occasion for his Assistancej* be it

enacted by the Authority aforesaid, 'That Four-fifths of the Creditors in Number and Value, present at the

Meeting after the last Diet of the Bankrupt’s Examination, or at any After-Meeting called for the Purpose,

may authorize the Trustee, with Consent of the Commissioners, or any two of them, to allow and pay to

such Bankrupt conforming to the Terms of this Act, from 'Time to Time, as they shall think fit, such Sum

or Sums of Money, out of the Proceeds of his own Estate, as they shall think proper, towards the Subsistence

and Support of himself and Family till the Period assigned for the second Dividend,not exceeding two Gui-

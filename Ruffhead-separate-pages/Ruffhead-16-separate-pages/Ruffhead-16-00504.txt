iUoh*Part onc> Chapter seventeen,. intituled, An Act concerning the Sale of Bankrupt's Lands, required certain Forms

reciiuj, c of Publication and Citation, which in Practice have been found to be expensive and inconvenient; and

4 another A£i of the Parliament of Scotland, in the Year one thousand six hundred and ninety-five. Chapter

4 fix, intituled, Act regulating the Sale and Payment of Bankrupt's Estate, made it lawful for Purchasers of

4 such Estates to consign the Price after a certain Time, in the Hands of the Magistrates and Town Council

4 of Edinburgh, which Method has been found inconvenient, and has seldom been practised; and by an Ar-

4 tide in the Regulations of the Session established in the same Year, one thousand six hundred and ninety-

4 five, Section twenty-six, it was provided, that the ranking of the Creditors should proceed and be concluded

4 by Decree before the Sale of the Lands, which Regulation has generally been prejudicial to the Creditors ;1

be it enacted, That the said in Part recited Acts {hall be, and the fame are hereby in so far repealed; and the

Court of Session {hall have full Power to make Acts of Sederunt for abridging the Forms of Publication

and Citation, and regulating the Proceedings in Procefies of Sale, Ranking, and Division, whether at the

Instance of Creditors or of apparent Heirs; and in every Cafe of a Sale under the Authority of the Court of

Session, it {hall be lawful to the Purchaser at any Term of IVkitfunday or Martinmas subsequent to,

the Term of Payment of the Price, to lodge the Price, with the Interelf due upon it, in the Royal Bank or

Bank of Scotland, at such Interest as can be procured for it, by doing which, and by giving Notice thereof to

the Agent who carried on the Sale, he shall be discharged of the said Price; and further, the Court of Session,

upon the Application of any of the Creditors, shall be impowered to make an Order onthe Purchaser to lodge

the Price and Interest at any of the said Terms, subsequent to the Term of Payment, in one or other of the said

Banks, sufficient Intimation being always previously given both to the Purchaser and to the common Agent

for the Creditors, that such Application is made, in order that all Parties may have an Opportunity to object;

and in all Cafes of judicial Sales, the Lands or other heritable Subjects may be brought to actual Sale fofoonas

the necessary previous Steps arc taken, whether the Ranking be concluded or not, unless the Court, upon Ap-

plication of any Party concerned, shall find sufficient Cause to delay the Sale.

VIII. And whereas Doubts have arisen upon the Construction of an Act, made in the Year one thousand

4 six hundred and ninety, Chapter twenty, intituled. Act anent the Sale of Bankrupt's Lands, in so far as it (e-

4 quires that the common Debtor be found Bankrupt, and utterly insolvent be it enacted, That a judicial

Safe, at the Instance of Creditors, may in all Cafes proceed where the Interest of the Debts and the other

annual Burdens exceed the yearly Income of the Subjects under Sale, or where a Sequestration shall

have taken place under this or any former Statute, without other Proof of Bankruptcy or Insolvency.

IX. And whereas by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland, in the Year one thousand five hundred and

4 forty. Chapter one hundred and six, concerning Charges Co enter Heir, and another Act in the Year one

4 thousand six hundred and twenty-one, Chapter twenty-seven, concerning Apprisings against Heirs, it

4 was ordained, that Charges against Heirs unentered, which were to be the foundation of apprising against

4 their Preideceifors Lands, might proceed at the Instance of Creditors commanding them to enter within

4 forty Days after the Charge, but it has been doubted whether the fame or a longer Term is required when

the Person charged is out of Scotland, and it is inexpedient that such Inducia {hould be of long Duration;’

be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Inducta of a Charge to enter Heir shall in no Cafe exceed

forty Days, whether the Person charged be within the Kingdom or out of it, and that after one such Charge,

whether general or special, has been given at the Instance of any Creditor, every subsequent Charge, at the

instance of the fame, or of any other Creditor, may be upon the Inducia of twenty Days only, any Law or

Practice to the contrary notwithstanding.

X. And, in order to lessen the Number of Adjudications for Debt, and consequently the Expence to all

Parties, and to facilitate the paripajju Preference of Creditors in similar Circumstances; be it enacted, That

the Lord Ordinary officiating in the Court of Session, before whom the first Process of Adjudication against

any Estate, for Payment or Security of Debt, is called, shall ordain Intimation thereof to be made in the

Minute Book, and on the Wall, in order that any other Creditors of the common Debtor, who at the next

calling of the Cause can shew, that although they have not executed their Summonses of Adjudication, they

are in other Respects by the Nature of their Grounds of Debt, and Steps taken by them, in Condition to

proceed in adjudging their Debtor’s Estate, may produce the Instructions of their Debts, with Summonses of

Adjudication, libelled and signeted, for the Purpose of their being conjoined in the Decree of Adjudication,

twenty Sederunt Days being allowed for such Intimation, before the Cause can be called a second Time;

and if any of these Forms {hall happen to be omitted, the said Adjudications {hall be null and void, without

Agcnf %r Faflof Prejudice to the Validity and Order of ranking of posterior Adjudications, according to the Rules of Law ;

may adjudge for and further, that when the Estate of a Debtor is brought into the Court of Session by a Ptocefs of judicial Sale

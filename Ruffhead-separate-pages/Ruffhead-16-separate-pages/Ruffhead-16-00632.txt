A.D. 1794.

4 Assignemnt hath been fraudulently made, to the infinite Prejudice of the fair and honest Creditor, though

sufficient Proof could not be obtained to convict the Party of a fraudulent Design / be it enacted, That when-

ever it shall be proved by one or more credible Witness or Witnesses, to the Satisfaction of the Court

to which any Prisoner shall be brought up in order to obtain his or her Discharge, that such Prisoner

has fold, transferred, conveyed, or assigned, to any Person or Persons, all or any Part of his Estate or

Effects, subsequent to the Time of his Imprisonment, without just Caiife for so doing, to be allowed by

the Justices preiiding in such Court as aforesaid, every such Debtor shall lose all the Benefits and Ad.-

vantages that he might otherwise have claimed under the Authority of this Act, and shall not be entitled to

his or her Discharge ; and every such Sale, Transfer, Conveyance, or Assignemnt is hereby declared to

be null and void.

XL. And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That every Gaoler or Keeper of any Prison

shall, and is hereby required to suffer, in the Day-time, any Person or Persons desiring the fame, to fee and

speak, in the Lodge, or some convenient Room in the said Prison, with any Prisoner or Prisoners, whose

Names are inserted in the above-mentioned List or Lists, or London Gazette, or other Newspapers, or any

of them, and also fee, in the true and genuine Books of the said Prison, the Entries made of the Name or

Names of such Prisoner or Prisoners, Debtor or Debtors, together with the Name or Names of the Person

or Persons at whose Suit or Suits he, she, or they are or were detained ; and if any such Gaoler or Keeper

shall neglect or refuse to comply with what is here above required, every such Gaoler or Keeper who shall

so offend in the Premises shall forfeit and pay to the Person so refused and aggrieved the Sum of forty Pounds,

to be recovered with Costs of Suit, by Act on of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or information in any of the Courts

at JVejimlnfler, wherein no Essoin, Protection, Wager of Law, or more than one Imparlance shall be al-

lowed, by and in the Name or Names of the Person or Person-. so refused and aggrieved.

XLL And be it further enacted, That if any Gaoler or Keeper, or deputed Gaoler or Keeper, of any

Prison or Prisons, shall make or cause to be made any false Entries, in any Book or Books belonging to any

Prison or Gaol under his Care, or of which he is or was Gaoler, or shall prepare or keep, or cause to be

prepared or kept, any Life Book or Books, in order for any false or untrue Entry or Entries to be' made

therein, or shall insert in any List to be delivered in as aforesaid, the Name or Names of any Person or

Persons who was not in a<ftual Custody as aforesaid, (except as in the Oath of every such Gaoler or Keeper,

or deputed Gaoler or Keeper, shall be excepted,) every such Gaoler or Keeper, or deputed Gaoler or

Keeper, shall, over and above the Penalties which he shall be liable to for every such Fraud, forfeit and pay

the Sum of five hundred Pounds, to be recovered with Treble Costs of Suit, by and in the Name and for

the Use of any Person or Persons who shall be prejudiced by any such false Entry or Entries, which Penalties

shall and may be recovered by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or Information in any of his Majesty’s Courts

of Record at IVijhnwjUr^ wherein no Essoin, Protection, or Wager of Law, or more than one Imparlance

shall be allowed.

XLII. And be it further enacted, That if any Debtor, being thereunto required by any Creditor, shall

refuse to discover and declare the Trade or Occupation, and Habitation or hft Place of Abode of the Person

or Persons at whose Suit he or file is or was detained or charged in Custody, or if any Prisoner being called

for and desired by any Creditor or Creditors to come to the Lodge of the Prison in which any such Prisoner

shall be confined, without some reasonable Cause being made appear to the contrary, every such Debtor,

upon Proof being made thereof, before the Justices at any General or Quarter Session of the Peace, or any

Adjournment thereof, to be held as aforesaid, shall not have or receive any Benefit or Discharge by or under

this Act; any Thing herein contained to the contrary thereof in anywise notwithstanding.

XLIIL 4 And whereas there is but one Common or County Gaol for each of the respective Counties of

4 York or Lincoln, which said Counties are each of them divided into several Ridings or Divisions, all which'

4 have several Commissions of the Peace ; and if the Gaoler of those Gaols be obliged to carry the Debtors,

4 Prisoners therein, to the Quarter Session of each Riding or Division, the fame will be a very great Charge,

4 not only to such Gaolers, but aflb to the Prisoners, in those large Counties;’ be it therefore enabled by the

Authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful for two or more Justices of the Peace for any of the

Ridings or Divisions in the respective Counties, (or any other County or Counties where the Prisons are at

a Distance from the Place where the Sessions are held,) at the Common or County Gaol thereof respectively,

or at some convenient Place near thereto, and they are hereby required to assemble and meet, and to

hold Session there, by Adjournment from their respective Quarter Session from Time to Time, for the

Discharge of the r.efpeblive Prisoners therein, according to the Powers, Limitations, and Directions of

this Act.

XLIV. 4 And whereas the Division or Distribl of Holland\ in the said County of Lincoln, is distant near

4 forty Miles from the said County Gaol, and it is highly inconvenient and expensive for the Justices of the

4 Peace acting for the said Division to be obliged to travel to the said Gaol for the sole Purpose of discharging

4 the Prisoners under the Powers by this Act given;’ be it therefore enabled, That for the several Purposes

aforesaid, the Justices for the said Division or Distriift of Holland may adjourn their original Sessions to the

County Gaol, or some Place near thereunto; and that it shall and may be lawful for any two Justices of

the Peace, adiing either for the Parts of Lindsey, Kejseven, or Holland, to hold such adjourned Sessions for

the folc Purpose of discharging such Prisoners; Notice of the Adjournment of such original Session being

given by the Clerk of Sessions to such Justices, and who shall attend there to register the Proceedings of the

said Court, so far as the fame relate to or affcbl the Discharge of any Prisoner detained for Debt in the

Division of Holland, and claiming the Benefit of this Act.

CAP. LV.

An AO for establishing a Company for carrying on Trade between the Kingdom of Great

Britain and the Coasts, Harbours, and Countries of Africa \ and for enabling the said

Company to hold, by Grant from his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, and from the

Native Princes of Africa, a certain District of Land, commonly called *fbe Ptninfula of

Sierra Leone, now vested in his Majesty, or belonging to the said Princes, for the

better enabling the said Company to carry on the said Trade,

preamble# 4 X17 HEREAS the establishing of a general Trade and Commerce from these Kingdoms to and with

4 VV the Coasts of Africa, and from thence to and with the several interior Kingdoms and Countries of

4 that Continent, would be highly beneficial to the Manufactories and other trading Interests of these King-

4 doms : And whereas the interior Kingdoms and Countries of the said Continent have not hitherto been

' 4 explored by Europeans, nor hath any regular Trade ever been carried on therewith from these Kingdoms,

4 norcanfuch Undertakings be conveniently carried on and supported, unless a considerable Capital Joint

4 Stock is raised for that Purpose: And whereas it is also necessary for the Parties engaging therein, that

4 they should have the foie and absolute Possession of some District of Land on the said Coaits, where they

4 may form a Factory or Settlement for their Servants, a secure Depository for their Goods and Merchan-

4 dize, and a safe Harbour for their Shipping : And whereas several Persons have already formed themselves

4 into a Society, and subscribed considerable Sums of Money for the Purpose of establishing and carrying on

4 such Trade and Commerce ; but are apprehensive that Difficulties may arise as well in recovering Debts

4 which may grow due to the Joint Stock, as in defending Suits or Actions which may be commenced or

4 brought against the Subscribers for any Matter or Thing relative to the Society, as by Law all the several

4 Sublcribers and Proprietors to and in the Society must in such Cafe both sue and be sued, implead and be

4 impleaded by their several and distinct Names and Descriptions ; and it is expedient that the several Sub-

4 feribers and Proprietors shall be protected from becoming liable to the Payment of any Sum or Sums of

4 Money, beyond their respective Shares in such Capital Joint Stock: And whereas many Persons who

4 are not now liable to become Bankrupts, within the Intent and Meaning of any of the Laws now in

4 Force concerning Bankrupts, are likewise fearful of subscribing Money to carry on the laudable Purposes

4 of the said Society, as by becoming Subscribers to and Part Owners of the said Capital Joint Stock, and

4 by being engaged or concerned in the Dealings to be carried on therewith, they may be liable to have

4 Commissions of Bankrupt issued against them as Traders : Therefore, for the moreeafily effedfing the

44 Purposes of the said Society, and for avoiding the Difficulties aforesaid, the said Society are desirous of being

4 incorporated, and having a Common Seal and Name, by which they may be known and distinguHhed,

4 sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted;

and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords

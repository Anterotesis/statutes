CAP. XXXIV.

An Act for indemnifying all Persons who have been concerned in advising, or carrying

into Execution, an Order of the Lords Commissioners of his M fly’s Treasury, re-

spefting the Exportation of Pot APnes or Pearl Ashes; for preventing Suits in confe-

quence of the fame; for authorizing his Majesty to prohibit the Exportation, or carry-

ing coastwise, of Pot Ashes or Pearl Ashes; and for making further Provisions rela-

tive thereto.—[17th April 1794.]

WHEREAS it appears that a very unusual Quantity of Pet and Pearl Afii has of late been exported

or entered for Exportation to France, in Neutral Vessels, which there is Reason to suppole was

4 intended for the Purpose of increasing the Production of Silt-petre in chat Country, to be afterwards

4 manufactured into Gunpowder: And whereas the Exportation, or carrying out ol the Ports of this

4 Kingdom, of certain Cargoes of Pot and Pearl Ash has been Hopped by Order or Orders from the Lords

4 Commissioners of his Majesty’s Treasury, and by the Oificers of his Majesty’s Customs: And whereas

the said Orders and Proceedings may not be flricily justiiied by Law, but were lb much for the Service of

the Publick, and so necessary for preventing his Majesty’s Enemies from being supplied with Articles that

4 contribute to the manufacturing of Naval and Military Stores, that they ought to be jufiified by

4 Act of Parliament: And whereas it is expedient that his Majesty should be inverted with the

4 Power to prohibit the Exportation of Pot and Pearl Ash, and of other Articles which, though

4 not ftriftiy Naval or Military Stores, may, by some Procels, be converted into or made useful in

4 increasing the Quantity of Naval and Military Stores :* Be it therefore enabled by the King’s most

Excellent M.3 rty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and

Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That all Per-

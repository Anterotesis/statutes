XXIII. And be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Nomination of the Trustee being thus ref

ported and approved of, the Court shall, at the fame Time, ordain the Bankrupt to execute and deliver, within

a certain reasonable Time to be specified in the Interlocutor, a Disposition or other proper Deed or Deeds

of Conveyance or Assignemnt, making over to the said Trustee or Trustees, in their Order, his whole Estate

and Eftedts, heritable and moveable, real and personal, wherever situated, and which shall specially describe

and convey the Premises,so far as they are known, or so far as the Trustees shall think it necessary, and be id

such Form and Style as may effectually vest the Right in him, with full Powers of Recovery and Sale, for Be-

hoof of the Creditors; and if the Bankrupt shall, without reasonable Cause, neglect or refuse to obey such

Order, the Court may punish him by Imprisonment; and in all Events, whether such Deed or Deeds be exe-

cuted or not, it is hereby statuted and declared, that the said whole Estate and Effects,of whatever Kind, and

wherever situated, (in so far as may be consistent with the Laws of other Countries, when the Effedh are out

of Scotland\) shall be deemed and held to be vested in the said Trustee, or Trustees in Succession, for Behoof

of the Creditors, and the Court shall, in the Act or Order above mentioned, declare every Right, Title, and

Interest, which was formerly in the Bankrupt, to be now in the Trustee for the Purposes aforesaid, and parti-

cularly shall adjudge, decern, and declare the whole Lands and other heritable Estate belonging to the Bank-

rupt within the Jurisdiction of the Court, and which, as far as known, shall be specially enumerated and de-

scribed, to pertain and belong to the Trustee, or Trustees in Succession, absolutely and irredeemably, to the

End that the fame may be fold, levied, and recovered, and converted into Money for Payment of the Credit

tors, which Adjudication, being of the Nature of an Adjudication in Implement, as well asfor Payment,or

Security of Debt, shall be subject: to no legal Reversion: Declaring always. That if any Part of the Bankrupts

Property happens to be entailed, or otherwise of a limited Nature, the Conveyance to be executed by him,or

the Decree of Adjudication to be obtained by the Trustee, shall only be understood to carry that Right and

Interest in the Estate which the Bankrupt himself has, and can fafeiy convey, and which his Creditors can

validly attach.

of the Act or Order aforesaid, adjudging the Estate of the Bankrupt, to be recorded, within fifteen Days of

EffedI that Abbreviates of Adjudications must be recorded; and this being done, the Trustee shall be entitled,

for Behoof of the whole Creditors, to rank in the same Manner upon the heritable Estate as if it had been a'

common Decree of Adjudication obtained and rendered effectual at the Date of the first Deliverance on the

Petition for Sequestration, accumulating the whole Debts of the Bankrupt, Principal and Interest, as at that

Period, and adjudging for Security or Payment thereof, and it shall further operate as a complete Attachment

and Transfer of the moveable or personal Estate for Behoof of all the Creditors, at the Date of the first Deli-

verance aforesaid, and the said Disposition, Adjudication, or Transfer shall not be reducible upon any Ground

of Law, nor struck at by any prior Inhibition, saving always the Effect which such Inhibition may be entitled

to against Contra&ions of Debt by the Bankrupt posterior to the Inhibition; and provided always, that the

said Disposition or Adjudication of the heritable Estate by the Act or Order of the Court, or the Adjudication

before-mentioned, which the Court may direct in Name of the common Agent or Factor, during the De-

pendence of a judicial Sale, shall have no Effect upon any Question of Succession between the Heir and

Executor of the Creditor.

dication, the feudal Titles requisite by the Law of Scotland to vest heritable Property shall and may be

made up, either in the Person of the Trustee, or in the Person of the Purchaser from him, in virtue of such

Trustee’s Conveyance, agreeably to the f orms of the Law of Scotland\ and each Trustee succeeding a prior

Trustee through Death. Resignation, or Removal (unless substituted at the first Nomination, in which Cafe

by Adjudication obtained by the new Trustee, on a summary Application to the Court of Session as before,

and the Superior shall, if required, be obliged to enter the Trustee or Trustees, or Purchaser, in the fame

Manner as he is directed by an Act made in the twentieth Year of his late Majesty's Reign for abolishing

Ward-holdings; and if the Trustee shall afterwards di(cover any other heritable Estate belonging to the

Bankrupt, and which belonged to him at the Date of the first Deliverance aforesaid, the fame shall be ad-

judged in Manner before directed, and to the fame Effect; and in case the Bankrupt’s own Titles to any

Part of the Estate^heritable Of moveable, real or personal, which belonged to him at that Period, or to

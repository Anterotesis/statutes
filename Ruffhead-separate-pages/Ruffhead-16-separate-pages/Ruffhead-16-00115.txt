Owners of the Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, out of which any such Relit or Rents in Arrear

not in any Manner prejudice or affect the Right or Title of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, to any

such Rents or Arrears of Rents grown due or payable and remaining unpaid, before the Sale of any such

Relit or Rents; nor shall any Receipt or Acquittance by the Purchaser of any such Relit or Rents, fubie-

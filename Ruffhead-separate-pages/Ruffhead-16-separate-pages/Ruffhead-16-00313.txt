that such last-mentioned Master or Mistress, his or her Executors and Administrators, each and every of

them, shall be held and bound by the several Promises and Covenants contained in any such Indenture of

Apprenticeship on the Part of the Master or Mistress therein named, his or her Executors or Adminis-

trators, to be done and performed, in like Manner as if such Master or Mistress obtaining such Order as

aforesaid had duly executed the Counterpart of such Indenture^ and that such Master or Mistress and Ap-

prentice shall be subject and liable to the several Penalties, Provisions, and Regulations which shall then be in

Force for the better Government and good Order of Masters and Parish Apprentices ; and that all Justices

of the Peace shall have the like Powers and Authority, with respeci thereto, as they shall then have by any

Act or Acts of Parliament relating to Parish Apprentices.

III. And be *it further enacted, That all and Angular the Regulations and Provisions herein-before made,

and directed to take place on the Death of the original Master or Mistress, shall be deemed and taken to re-

late to the like Event of the Death of any such subsequent Master or Mistress, and to their several Rela-

tiens and Representatives before enumerated, from Time to Time, as often as the Cafe shall happen, du-

ring the Continuance of the Term mentioned in any such Indenture of Apprenticeship.

IV. And be it further enacted, That in case no such Application shall be made as aforesaid within three

Calendar Months next after the Death of such Master or Mistress, or in case such two Justices, to whom any

such Application as aforesaid shall have been made, shall not think fit that such Apprenticeship should be

continued, then the said Apprenticeship shall be determined, and the Indenture of Apprenticeship and Co-

venants therein contained shall be at an End, in like Manner as they would have been at the Expiration of

the Term therein mentioned.

V. Provided always, and be it enacted, That nothing herein-before contained shall extend, or be con-

ftrued to extend, to any Parish Apprentice, but to such only as shall be living with, and shall make Part

of the Family, or shall be in the ablual Employment, of such original Master or Mistress, or of any subse-

quent Master or Mistress appointed under and by virtue of the several Provisions of this Act at the Time of

the Death of any such Mailers or Mistresses respectively.

VI. c And whereas much Difficulty and Delay must necessarily happen in bringing an Action upon the

â‚¬ Covenant for A/laintenance before mentioned contained in any such Indenture of Parish Apprenticeship

be it enacted, That in case any such original Master or Miftrefc as aforesaid, or any Master or Mistress ap-

pointed under or by virtue of this Act, shall, during the Term of any such Parish Apprenriceship as aforesaid,

or if the Executors or Administrators of such Masters or Mistresses, any or either of them, having Assets,

shall, during such three Calendar Months as aforesaid, refuse or neglect to maintain and provide for any

such Apprentice, according to the Terms of such Covenant, it shall and may be lawful for .any two Justices of

the Peace of the County, City, Town, Riding, Division, or Place in which the Parifl^fc^lace shall lie, to

which such Apprentice shall belong, on Complaint of such Apprentice, or of the Churchwardens and Over-

seers of the Poor of such Parish or Place, by Warrant under their Hands and Seals, tolevy by Distress and

Sale of the Personal Estate and Effects or Assets of such Master or Mistress respectively, such Sum or Sums

of Money as shall be necessary for the Maintenance and Cloathing of such Apprentice, and as shall also be

necessary to reimburse to the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of such Parish or Place, any Sum

or Sums of Money that shall have been reasonably expended by them for that Purpose.

VII. 4 And whereas it frequently happens that Personsare compellable, under and by virtue of the said Act

c of the ninth and tenth Years of King William^ to take a greater Number of Parish Apprentices than it is

4 convenient for them to maintain or employ in their own Families, and they are therefore forced to place

4 out or assign over such Apprentices to other Persons ; and it is proper that such Alignment should be le-

4 gaily made, under the Inspection and Controul of the Magistrates, as well for the Benefit of the Appren-

4 tice, as that the original Master maybe discharged from his Covenants in respect of such Apprentice ;

4 and it is fit that the Person to whom such Assignemnt shall be made, and also the Apprentice, should be

4 made subject to the ordinary Jurisdiction of justices of the Peace with respect to Masters and Parish Ap-

4 prentices be it enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for any Master or Mistress of any such Par ifh

Apprentice as aforesaid, by Indorsement on the Indenture of Apprenticeship, or by other Instrument in

Writing, by and with theConfentof two Justices of the Peace of the County, City, Town, Riding, Divi-

fion, or Place where such Master or Mistress shall dwell, testified by such Justices under their Hands,

to assign such Apprentice to any Person who is willing to take such Apprentice for the Residue of the Term

mentioned in such Indenture of Apprenticeship : Provided always, That such Person to whom such Appren-

tice is intended to be assigned, shall at the fame Time, by Indorsement on the Counterpart of such Inden-

ture, or by Writing under his or her Hand, dating the said Indenture of Apprenticeship, and the Indorse-

ment and Consent aforesaid, declare his or her Acceptance of such Apprentice, and acknowledge himself,

herself, his, or her Executors and Administrators, 'to be bound by the Agreements and Covenants mentioned

in the said Indenture, on the Part of the Master or Mistress of such Apprentice to be done and performed;

which Indorlcment or Instrument maybe in the Forms or to the Effect mentioned in the Schedule hereunto

annexed, marked with the Letters D. and E.; and in such Cafe such Apprentice shall be deemed and taken

to be the Apprentice of,such subsequent Master or Mistress to whom such Assignemnt shall be made, to all

Intents and Pur poles whatsoever, and fc^from Time to 'Time, as often as it {hall be necessary or convenient

for any such subsequent Master or Mistress to part nitn any such Apprentice ; and all Justices of the Peace

shall have the like Power and Authority, i:i the fevcial Cafes last mentioned, with respect as well to the lub-

(equent Master or Mistress, Masters or MTcrefles, as to the Apprentice, as such Justices shall then have by

any Law for the better Regulation of Parish Apprentices.

mine, at the Meeting aforesaid held after the last Examination of the Bankrupt, or any other Meeting ad-

vertifed for the Purpose, whether the Trustee is to bring the said heritable Estate to judicial Sale before the

Court of Session, or to dispose thereof by voluntary publick Sale ; and if the latter Mode is adopted, the Sale

made after such Advertisement, and at such Upset Price,1 and upon such Articles and Conditions as shall be

fixed by the Trustee, with the Consent of a Majority of the said Commissioners, shall be valid and effectual,

with and under the Burden of all real Securities or other Liens upon the Estate, in so far as the same are pre-

ferable to the Disposition or Decree veiling the said Estate in the Trustee, but which Burden shall go no

farther than to the Extent of the Price ; and the Purchaser fharil have no Concern with the Application of the

Price after Satisfaction of the preferable Securities aforesaid ; and if a Majority of Creditors in Value deter-

mine for a judicial Sale, the Trustee shall be obliged forthwith to proceed in the fame, and shall be entitled to

carry it on as to a Part of the Estate, without including the Whole, and without any other Proof of Bank-

ruptcy than the Act of Sequestration, and it shall be enough to call the Bankrupt himself, and his real Credi-

tors in Possession upon a Citation of fifteen Days, whether they are within the Kingdom or not, and the

ediClal Citations shall be dispensed with : Provided always, That nothing in this Act contained shall bar the

Right which any real Creditor may have by the Law, as it (lands at present, to bring his Debtor’s Estate to

.a judicial Sale at his own Instance, unless such Sale has been previously brought at the Instance of the

Trustee, or unless a Majority of the Creditors in Value shall have previously determined upon a voluntary

Sale ; and in the Event of the Estate being sold by judicial Sale, the Balance of the Price, if there be any,

after satisfying the preferable Securities aferefaiid^ shall be paid into the Hands of the Trustee, as a Part of the

Fund of Division to be made by him among the Creditors in general, the Purchaser being always entitled,

upon making full Payment of the Price, whether the Lands have been fold in the one Way or in the other,

to a Difchaige from the Trustee, which shall have the EfteCl completely to difincumber the Subject ac-

quired ; and further, the Creditors shall be entitled to draw their Shares of the Price, in virtue of the Dispofi-

tien and Adjudication before mentioned, without the Neceftity of any other Adjudication ; and no other

Adjudication led or made effectual after the Date of the first Deliverance aforesaid, shall have any Effect in

Competition with the Right of the Creditors under the Sequestration.

XXXIV. And be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Trustee shall be obliged to lodge all

Money he receives in such Bank, or with such Banking Company, as Four-fifths of the Creditors in Number

and Value at any General Meeting shall appoint, and failing such Appointment in the Royal Bank, or Bank

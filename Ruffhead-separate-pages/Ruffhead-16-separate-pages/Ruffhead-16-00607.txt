CAP. LXIV.

An Act for the more effectually repairing of such Parts of the Highways of this Kingdom

as are to be repaired by two Parishes.-—[23d May 1794.]

4 \X7HHtEAS the Common Highways in this Kingdom are to be maintained and kept in Repair (ex-

▼ ▼ cept in certain Cafes) by the Inhabitants of the several Parishes in which such Common Highways

4 arefituated; but it frequently happens that the Boundaries of such Parishes pass through the Middle of

4 such Common Highways, and one Side of such Highways is situated in one Parish, and the other Side of

4 such Highways is situated in another Parish, whereby great Inconveniencies have often arisen to such Pa-

4 rifhes, in settling the Time and Manner of repairing and amending the same, and great Detriment has-

4 arisen thereby to the Publick from the Want of the due Repair of such Highways:’ For Remedy thereof,

be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords

Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the

fame. That it shall and may be lawful for any two Justices of the Peace for any County, Riding, or Di-

vision, upon Complaint or Application to them by any Surveyor, or any one of the Surveyors of the High-

ways of any Parish, (dating to such Justices in Writing, and by a Plan thereunto annexed, that there is

situated in the said Parish, and also in some other Parish adjoining thereto, specifying the fame, a certain

Common Highway, particularly describing the fame by Metes, Bounds, and Admeasurement thereof, one

Side of which Common Highway ought to be made or repaired by one of such Parishes, and the other Side

thereof by the other of such Parishes,) to issue their Summons, with a Copy of such Writing and Plan

thereunto annexed, to the Surveyor or one of the Surveyors of the Highways of such other Parish, to appear

before them on a Day to be mentioned in such Summons, not more than fourteen Days, nor less than leven

Days from the Day of the Date of such Summons; and that in case the Parties shall then appear before such

Justices, they may then proceed finally to decide the Matter in the Manner hereinafter mentioned, in case

all the Parties shall consent thereto; but in case the Surveyor summoned {hall not appear on such first

Summons, or appearing shall require further Time, the said Justices shall adjourn the further Consideration

of the Matter for any further Time, not more than twenty-one Days, nor less than fourteen Days from

the Day of such Adjournment, of which the Surveyor not appearing shall have Notice; on which Day the

said Justices shall proceed to hear the Parties and their Witnesses, and whether the Party summoned

does or does not appear, shall proceed to examine and finally determine the Matter in Form following:

(that is to say,) That it shall and may be lawful for such Justices^ and they are hereby required, to divide

the Whole of such Common Highway by a transverse Line crofting such Highway, into two equal Parts,

or into two such unequal Parts and Proportions as, in Consideration of the Soil, Waters, Floods, the In-

equality of such Highway, or any other Circumstances attending the fame, they, in their Discretion, shall,

think just and right; and to declare, adjudge, and order that the Whole of such Highway on both Sides

thereof, in one of such Parts, shall be maintained and repaired by one of such Parishes, and that the Whole

of such Highway on both Sides thereof, in the other of such Parts, shall be maintained and repaired by the

other of such Parishes; and shall cause such their Order, and a Plan of such Highway, and the Allotment

thereof as before mentioned, to be fairly delineated on Paper or Parchment, and filed with the Clerk of the

Peace of the County in which such Highway shall happen to lie, and shall also cause such Posts, Stones, or

other Boundaries to be placed and let up in such Highway as in their Judgment shall be necessary for afeer-

taining the Division and Allotment aforesaid.

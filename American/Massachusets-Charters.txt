COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.

In the House of R, January 15th, 1812.

Resolved, That the Honourable NathanJ)ane, William Prescott, and Joseph Story, Esquires, be a committee, at‘the expense of the commonwealth, to collect the Charters and the publick and general Laws of the late colony and province of Massachusetts Bay; and that the said committee be and they are hereby authorized, when the same Laws and Charters shall be collected as aforesaid, to cause five hundred copies* iL. io«»f to ho printed at the expense of and for the use of this commonwealth, iu a volume of the royal octavo size, with suitable title pages, running titles, and analytical iu. dexes. And the said committee are hereby further authorized to add in an appendix any other documents or laws which they may deem proper to explain the jurisprudence of this commonwealth. And that the said committee be required to proceed as soon as conveniently may be in the execution of the purposes of this resolve.

And be it further resolved, that the said committee, after they shall have collected and examined the same laws, report to the legislature such laws as I • are not repealed, and which iu their opinion require to be repealed.

(f • By a resolve passed June 11, 1813, this number was increased to one thousand.

THE UTILITY AND ADVANTAGES OY THIS WOKK.

The Statutes of the late colony and province of Massachusetts have of late years become unusually scarce. Of the former no edition has been published since the year 1672 j and though of the latter*i^unerous editions have bedn at successive periods published, yet no edition is known to have comprehended a complete series of the publick statutes from the charter, in 1692, to the time of the revolution.

The sixth article of the sixth chapter of the constitution declares, “ that the laws whi$b have heretofore been adopted, used, and approved in the ptovince, colony, or state of Massachusetts, and usually practised on in the courts of law, shall still remain and be in full force, until altered or repealed by the legislature, such parts only excepted as are repugnant to the rights and liberties contained in this constitution.”

Of these statutes there has been no general repeal; but several of them remain in force; and in the cases of repealed acts, many are the uses to which they may be applied:

1. They decide upon all rights and titles, which vested at the time they were in operation. Such rights and titles may now come in question in trials at law, and can be correctly ascertained only by a recurrence to the statutes, which governed at the time when they accrued. For instance, the validity of sales of land by executors and administrators, and of the setting off of the same upon execution, must be ascertained by an examination of the laws in force at the time when the facts happened.

2. Former statutes upon the same subject matter often assist materially in the construction of later statutes. Instances of this kind are familiar to lawyers. One may not be uninteresting. The statute of February 6, *78*,

s. 8. which gave a share in the estate of a deceased parent to children, or their legal representatives, where such children or their representatives had no'legacy in the will of the parent, is substantially like the provincial statute of 12 William HI. ch. 7 ; and although the preamble of the latter is omitted, yet upon sound construction it has been held, that the statute of 1781 was not intended to extend to cases where the children, &c. were mentioned in the will, although no legacy were given to them, because the preamble to the statute of William III. shews that such cases were not within the mischiefs intended to be remedied.

3. A collection of the ancient statutes is important to shew the history and spirit of the times, and the gradual and progressive improvements in legislation. This cannot be matter of indifference to any portion of the community, and is peculiarly interesting to those who, as legislators, are to guard the publick rights and preserve the publick happiness.

4. Experience has shewn not only the use but the necessity of collecting these laws now existing in many volumes, and to be obtained but by very few.

When the edition of the statutes of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, of a publick nature, was published in the year 1801, as it was then an object to save expense, it was thought sufficient to publish, in the appendix, the Colony and Province Statutes, and parts of statutes of a publick nature, not then revised; and those also, that respected titles to real estates. But experience has since proved, that a muek more ample collection of those Colony and Province Aots is useful and necessary. And it has been found necessary, in a multitude of cases which have come under the consideration of the Court and Bar, to have recourse to those more ancient statutes, not only as applicable to facts which happened in the time of the Colony or Province, and now making part of the case before the court, or on which counsel must advise, but as very material in aiding in the construction of the revised laws; as will be seen on a careful reading of the Massachusetts Reports, and observed by every lawyer of experience, to whom several other reasons will occur for this publication.

ADVERTISEMENT.

In forming this volume, the committee preferred the chronological order, and have adopted it in regard to the laws of the province, but found it impracticable to pursue it in respect to the colony laws. These had been several times revised and printed; the last edition the committee could find was in the year 1672; this included the edition of 1658, as it was then formed, nearly. Many of the acts and orders published in these editions are without dates, and the dates of a number of them cannot now be found. These editions were in the digest form ; and if the dates of the laws in them, or the times when they were passed, could now be ascertained, a question would arise respecting them, because the general court, in each material revision, authorized the committee, appointed to eollcct and print the laws, to make verbal alterations in them. For instance, October 27, 1647, it ordered and enacted thus — “ the laws being to be put in print, it is meet they should be conveniently penned, therefore, it is desired that the committee for drawing up the laws will be careful therein ; and to that purpose they have liberty to make some change of form, to put in apt words, as occasion may require, provided the sense and meaning in any law or part thereof be not changedand the same day the general court directed the committee to leave wide margins for references to scripture; and October, 19th, 1658, it ordered and enacted “ that the book of laws, as they have been revised and corrected, and put into form by the order of this court, together with the alterations and additions

hereunto expressed, shall forthwith be printed and be in force in one month after the same.” Accordingly, the committee which digested the laws in 1658, made many alterations, mostly merely in the modes of expression j but sometimes they formed several acts on the same subject, of different dates, into one, much abridged in words at least: For instance, three acts were passed in 1633, 1642, and 1644, respecting certain material powers in the general court; these acts the committee in 1658 abridged, preserving the sense aud meaning, and formed into one section; and so in other cases. Finding this to be the state of the colony laws down to 1672, the committee in forming this volume did not judge it proper to bring into it the original acts where they were thus altered, because in 1658 the legislature declared the book or code then formed to be law, making it the law of the land, as the committee published it, and so sanctioning the variations from the original acts, as far as there were any. In the same manner must be viewed the many texts of scripture added by the committee in 1658 and 1672, at the ends or in the margins of many of the acts and orders; and hence it is they are still preserved; but very few of these are found in the original records of the laws. The edition of 1672 appears to be but little more thai* an extension of that of 1658.

The colony laws passed between 1672 and the charter of William and Mary, and included in this volume, were found in the original records, and might have been published in chronological order, but on inspection they were found to be, generally, in addition to the former colony acts, and so properly to be incorporated with them in their digest form, noting, however, in every case, the date. In the printed colony laws, the committee found the dates, or the times when passed, imperfectly expressed, as in no case scarcely the day or month, and in many cases no date. This defect they have attempted to remedy as far as they could by

adding the dates in sundry cases; and whenever the month is added in the dates, it has been by their having recourse to the publick records.

In the revisions in 1672, and before, the time of passing or of revising many of these colony acts was briefly noted in the margin, or at the end of an act, as “A. 46” for A.D. 1646, See. these are preserved in the volume for the reasons above, and because also sometimes useful references.

A number of colony acts of importance, especially in a historical view of our laws, have been found in the original records, not included in the edition of 1672; these have been selected and printed in this volume wherever found to have remained a material part of the colonial system.

N. B. The temporary acts published in this edition, it will appear, were continued down till generally revised in the revision of the laws since the year 1780 j the intermediate periods of continuance of them will appear in the reviving acts, also published in this edition generally.

Note further. When the time an act'was passed is expressed at the close of the title, it means the day the general court met in the session, or on the adjournment at which the same statute was enacted, it often being found impracticable to And the particular day on which it was in fact enacted.

Forasmuch as complaints have been made of a very evil practice of some disordered persons in the country, who use to take other men’s horses, sometimes upon the commons, and sometimes out of their own grounds and inclosures, and ride them at their pleasure without any leave or privity of the owners :

It is therefore ordered and enacted by the authority of this court, that whosoever shall take any other man’s horse, mare, ass, or drawing beast, either out of his inclosure, or upon any common or elsewhere, (except such be taken damage feasant and disposed of according to law) without leave of the owner, and shall ride or use the same, he shall pay to the party wronged treble damages, or if the complainant shall desire it, then to pay only ten shillings, and such as have not to make satisfaction, shall he punished by whipping, imprisonment or otherwise, as by law shall be adjudged; and auy one magistrate or county court may hear aud determine the same.

Sect ereas the laws published concerning fences

and cattle, being in the second edition, transported from their first order and method, much difficulty doth many times arise concerning the true meaning thereof, whereby great damages do accrue to many of the inhabitants, and consequently to the country : for prevention whereof:

This court doth order and enact, that where any cattle shall trespass on any propriety, not appearing to be suffi- Fence to «e-ciently fenced against swine sufficiently yoked and ringed, corn or cows and such cattle as will be restrained by a sufficient fence, in the judgment of the viewers of the fences, in all such cases the owners of the fence, or of the land, shall bear all such damages, as to them thereby sustained, any thing in the said order, or any other law.

ACTS RESPECTING IMPOST DUTIES.

Many acts of this kind were passed during the colony government: all the same in principle, but varied in form and practice till they become too voluminous to be printed in this limited edition. The imposts were, at first, small duties on wines and strong waters, and gradually increased in amount, and extended to some new articles, and the custom house officers were empowered to enter into houses or cellars, where they “ knew or suspected any wine or strong waters” were, and to seize such wines and strong waters as were not entered according to law; and, by law, they were to be assisted by the constables and others. These laws, also, included a tonnage duty. And by an act passed in April, 1668, a duty was made payable on “ all cyder, mum, ale and beer, sold in publick houses licensed to sell such articles. And by a long act passed in 1670, a duty was laid on “ all goods, wares, merchandizes, and provisions of all sorts (excepting fish, sheep’s wool, cotton wool, salt” and some other tilings by former laws exempted, &c.) “ which, from any foreign part, or other jurisdiction, shall be imported into any of our harbours, ports, shores or elsewhere within this jurisdiction, shall be rated in a just' proportion with estates rateable in the country, viz. for every twenty shillings value, shall be paid one penny in money.” By a law, passed October, 1680, an impost duty was laid on cattle brought in from the other colonics.

Sect. 3. In all cases wherein the law is obscure, so as the jury cannot be satisfied therein, whether it be grand or petty jury, they have liberty to present a special verdict, viz. if the law be so in such a point we find for the plaintiff, but if the law be otherwise we find for the defendant, in which case the determination doth properly belong to the court.

And all jurors shall have liberty in matter of fact, if they cannot find the main issue, yet to find and present in their verdict so much as they can.

Sect. 4. And if the court and jury shall so differ at any time about their verdict, that either of them cannot proceed with peaee of conscience, the case shall be issued and determined at the next court of assistants, in manner following, (i. c.) the attachment with the security for appearance at the county court, shall be continued to the court of assistants ; and if the plaintiff shall see cause further to prosecute his action, he shall give summons to the defendant as the law provideth, and shall also take out of the records of the county court the records of the said case with the evidences presented by both parties, aud bring the same to the court of assistants, where after the case is presented, as it was at the county court, both parties shall have liberty to make any new pleas or evidence before the bench and jury; and in ease the plaintiff shall not further prosecute his action in manner as is hereby provided, the defendant shall then have judgment granted him for his costs, at the next court of that county.

Sect. 6. Whereas in suits and actions brought into courts between party and party, sometimes the plaintiff and sometimes the defendant, and sometimes neither of them do attend to answer when they are ealled to prosecute or answer, which hath been too long connived at by the magistrates, and much time lost in sending to seek them out, or wait their coming in, whereby the country charges increased, 19

It is therefore hereby ordered and enacted, that if any Plaintiff plaintiff, he or she, have entered any action to be tried in any fendant’i courL or which comes orderly into any court, by replevin, penalty for appeal, or by the disagreement between the magistrates and not answ. jury in an inferiour court, and do not by bim or herself, or by calLhCir their attorneys make their appearance and prosecute their ac-c tion immediately after they have been three times called in

the court by name, after the first forenoon of the court; that then they shall be non-suited; and if plaintiff or defendant Plaintiff’s appear upon such call, they shall have their costs granted liberty to by the court against him or her that doth not appear; and if make new afterwards both parties do agree to try their case at the ,n same court, they shall be allowed so to do, the plaintiff paying half so much for a new entry as lie did before.

Sect. 7. This court being desirous to prevent all dis-Law rela. satisfaction and inconveniences that may arise in the trial of •Oa m°civil cases in inferiour courts, sometimes happening by rea-causes in son of disagreement between the bench and jury, formerly inferiour allowed by law; do order and enact that henceforth in all count. county courts, after that the bench have used all reasonable endeavours for clearing the case to the jury by declaring the law, and comparing the matter of fact proved therewith, the verdict of the jury finally given shall be accepted and judgment accordingly entered; and in like manner shall the proceeding be in the court of assistants, unless upon apparent corruption, or error in the jury, giving in their verdict contrary to law or evidence, the party cast shall in open court attaint the jury, and give sufficient bond and sureties within twelve hours after the verdict is accepted, to prosecute the said jury at the next court of assistants in an action of attaiut; in which case execution shall be respited, and the clerk of that court shall summon a jury of twenty-four able and discreet men, chosen as the law directs, to attend the service of the court, where the said action of attaint shall be tried in the first place; and if, on trial of the case, there shall be found manifest error or mistake, the party complaining shall be repaired his full damage from the other party to the original suit; and if, by the said jury of twenty-four, there be found bribery, conspiracy or other corruption in the jury attainted, they shall be punish-

Sect. 8. Whereas it is found by experience that the provision made by the Iawr, tit. Juries, May 1672, for relief in case of apparent corruption or error in the juiy’s giving in their verdict contrary to law and evidence, is perverted, to the burdening of the country with unreasonable troubles, the great wrong of parties concerned, with unjust reflections made thereby upon the juries:

It is ordered by this court and the authority thereof, that in all attaints, before the entry or allowance thereof, the party attainting shall give in writing under his hand, for what cause, and shew how the same doth appear so to be ; and in case upon a due trial as the law provides, the verdict of the former jury be confirmed, such person so attainting shall pay to the country, as a fine for unnecessary trouble to the court, ten pounds in money, and to the jurymen that gave in the former verdict forty shillings apiece. And in case it be for corruption, it shall be lawful for the jury so reproached jointly or severally to prosecute their action of slander as to them shall seem meet, and the plaintiff reproaching shall also be liable to such further fine to the country as the court shall judge meet. Also in all cases where the former verdict is confirmed, the party concerned shall have double costs and also double interest, for being detained of his just debt according to former verdict.

Sect. 25. This court considering the direction of our patent, relating to the stating of all military officers in this jurisdiction:

Do hereby order and declare, that all commission officers that at present are in power are confirmed according to their respective commissions; but for the time to come, where new are to be chosen, it is only in the power of the general court, or in case of emergency, for the council of the commonwealth, to nominate, choose, appoint, and empower all commission military officers, excepting the major general, and admiral by sea, the choice of whom is otherwise provided for by law; and for all inferiour officers in companies, they arc to be chosen and appointed by the commission officers of that company, and where no commission officer is, by the major of the regiment.

This court doth order, that what fines shall be due ac- them-cording to law from any soldier for defeot, in either arms or selves, trainings, which the clerk or clerks of the said troop or company shall not levy and gather into his hands, within one month after the training day on which the said defect is made, it shall be in the power of the oaptain or chief officer of that troop or foot company, to send the marshal or constable with an execution, and levy the said fines upon the estate of any such clerk or clerks so defective, unless the said clerk can make it appear to the captain, that he or they have been hindered either by sickness or the absence of the person delinquent being out of town.

And it is further ordered; that the clerk or clerks of every military troop or company shall once in six months render a particular account to the captain or chief officer, of all such fines as are levied by the said clerk, that the same may be disposed of for the good of the company according to Jaw.

Sect. 5. Whereas by reason that the orders of this court, referring to the commissionating, appointing, and empowering any particular person or persons for any special trust, negotiation or other matter, as from time to time do arise, are not duly and seasonably transcribed and delivered to those concerned therein, the expectation of this court is many times disappointed, and damage to the publick doth inevitably accrue:

During the colony government, many acts were passed and revised for the due observation of the Lord’s day, too long to be printed at large in this limited edition of the Colony and Province Laws; and the printing of them at large is the less necessary, as the substance of them has been brought forward and published in the Commonwealth’s statutes upon this subject.

CHAPTER LXXXVI.

ACTS RESPECTING SAILORS.

Sect. 1. Whereas many miscarriages are committed by sailors, by their immoderate drinking, and other vain expenses in ordinaries, which oftentimes occasion prejudice and damage to the masters and owners of the vessels to which they belong, their men being oftentimes arrested for debts so made when their ships are ready to set sail j for prevention whereof:

Sect. 2. For the prevention of great trouble and inconvenience that often bcfals masters and commanders of ships and other vessels by reason of their men running themselves into debt to several persons in the ports where they arrive, and, not being able to discharge their said debts, are restrained or imprisoned for the same, to the great hinderance and prejudice of the eommanders and owners of such ship or vessel:

CHAPTER LXXXVIII.

ACTS HESPECTING SCHOOLS.

Sect. 1. It being one chief project of Satan to keep men from the knowledge of the scripture, as in former times keeping them in unknown tongues, so in these latter times by persuading from the use of tongues, that so at least the true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded aud corrupted with false glosses of deceivers ; to the end that learning may not he buried in the graves of our forefathers, in church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our endeavours:

It is therefore ordered by this court and authority thereof; that every township within this jurisdiction, after the Lord hath increased them to the number of lifty householders, shall then forthwith appoint one within their towns to teach all such children as shall resort to him to write and read, whose wages shall be paid either by the parents or masters of such children, or by the inhabitants in general, by way of supply, as the major part of those that order the prudentials of the town shall appoint : provided that those who send their children be not oppressed by paying much more than they can have them taught for in other towns.

Sect. 2. And it is further ordered, that where any town shall increase to the number of one hundred families or householders, they shall set up a grammar school, the master thereof being able to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for the university: and if any town neglect the performance hereof above one year, then every such town shall pay five pounds per annum to the next such school, till they shall perform this order. [May, 1647.]

Sect. 3. Forasmuch as it greatly concerns the welfare of this country, that the youth thereof be educated, not only in good literature, but in sound doctrine :

This court doth therefore commend it to the serious consideration and special care of our overseers of the college, and the selectmen in the several towns, not to admit or suffer any such to be continued in the office or place of teaching, educating, or instructing youth or children in the college or schools, that have mauifested themselves unsound in the faith, or scandalous in their lives, and have not given satisfaction according to the rules of Christ. /Ls'v.

Sect. 4. Whereas the law requires every town consisting of one hundred families or upwards to set up a grammar school and appoint a master thereof, able to instruct youth, so as to lit them for the college; and upon neglect thereof the said town is to pay five pounds per annum to the next latin school until they shall perform that order:

And whereas the said law makes town8* the penalty for such towns as provide not schools, to pay to the next school ten pounds; this court hereby enacts that the penalty shall be twenty pounds, where there are two . hundred families or householders.

CUAFrER LXXXIX.

AX ACT AGAINST SELF-MURDER.

This court, considering how far satan doth prevail upon several persons within this jurisdiction to make away themselves, judgeth that God calls them to licar testimony against such wicked and unnatural practices, that others may be deterred therefrom:

Do therefore order, that from henceforth, if any person, inhabitant or stranger, shall at any time be found by any jury to lay violent hands on themselves, or be wilfully guilty of their own death, every such person shall be denied the privilege of being buried in the common burying place of Christians, but shall be buried in some common high-way, where the selectmen of the town where such person did inhabit shall appoint, and a cart-load of stones laid upon the grave ns a brand of infamy, and as a warning to others to beware of the like damnable practices.

[October, 1648.] Sect. 2. Whereas this country is at this time in great straits in respect of clothing, and the most likeliest way tending to our supply in that respect is the raising and keeping of sheep within our jurisdiction, it is therefore ordered and enacted by this court and the authority thereof, that, after the publication hereof, no person or persons whatsoever shall transport any ewes or ewe lambs out of this jurisdiction to any foreign port or place, upon the penalty of the forfeiture of five pounds for every ewe or ewe lamb so transported; the one fourth part to the informer, and the other three parts to the country: provided this order shall not hinder the selling of such sheep to any of the other colonies in confederation with us, they upon due notice given by our commissioners making a law to this purpose, to restrain transporting of sheep out of their respective jurisdictions.

It is therefore ordered, that the freemen of every town, with such others as are allowed, or the nuyor part of them, Town* shall have power to dispose of their own lands and woods, with all the privileges and appurtenances of the said towns, land*, to grant lots, and also to choose their own particular officers, as constables, surveyors for the high ways, and the like choo*e of-annually, or otherwise as need requires; and to make such ficcr*. laws and constitutions as may concern the welfare of their town; provided they be not of a criminal, but of a pruden- To make tial nature, and that their penalties exceed not twenty shil- order*, lings for one offence, and that they be not repugnant to the publick laws and orders of the country.

[1670.]

Sect. 5. Whereas complaints have been made, that many, especially in Boston, who are meet and fit to serve the country in the office of constable, take encouragement to withdraw from that service by reason of the smallness of the fines that towns have power to impose for such refusal:

It is therefore ordered, that henceforth it shall be lawful for the town of Boston to impose the fine of ten pounds; and for all other towns to impose the fiue of five pounds upon every such person, being legally chosen in the respective towns, that shall refuse to serve in the office of a constable in the town where he is chosen, if iu his person he-be able to execute it:

And the selectmen of every town are hereby empowered to order aud require the constables to levy the said fines by distress, which shall be to the use of the town. [S6, 42, 47, 53, 58.]

[1660.]

Sect. 7. It is ordered by this court and the authority hereof, that the following order shall lie directed and sent by the clerks of the several shire courts to the constables of the towns within their shire, who are enjoined faithfully to execute the same; and if upon the return made, it doth appear that the selectmen are negligent in executing the laws therein mentioned, the court shall proceed against them by admouition, or fine, as the merit of the case may require, and shall also dispose of single persons, or stubborn children or servants to the house of correction, according to the intent of the law, any law, custom or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.

Sect. 8. Whereas the law published by the honoured General Court, tit. Children and Youth, do require all towns from lime to time to dispose of all single persons and inmates within their towns to service, or otherwise:

It is required of the selectmen, that they see that all children and youth, under family government, he taught to read

197

perfectly the English tongue, have knowledge in the capital laws, and be taught some orthodox catechism, and that they be brought up to some honest employment, profitable to themselves and the commonwealth; and in case of neglect on the part of the family governors, after admonition given them, the said selectmeu are required, with the help of two magistrates, or next court of that shire, to take such children or apprentices from them, and place them forth with such as will look more straitly to them.

The neglect whereof, as by sad experience from court to court abundantly appears, doth occasion much sin and pro* faneness to increase among us, to the dishonour of God, and the eusnaring of many children and servants, by the dissolute lives and practises of such as do live from under family government, and is a great discouragement to those family governors, who conscientiously endeavour to bring up their youth in all Christian nurture, as the laws of God and this commonwealth doth require:

These are therefore in his majesty's name, to require you to acquaint the selectmen of your town, that the court doth expect and will require, that the said laws be accordingly attended, the prevalency of the former neglect notwithstanding : and you are also required to take a list of the names of those young persons within the bounds of your town, and all adjacent farms though out of all town bounds, who do live from under family government, viz. do not serve their parents or masters, as children, apprentices, hired servants, or journeymen ought to do, and usually did in our native country, being subject to their commands and discipline ; and the same you are to return to the next court to be held at on the day of

and hereof you are to make a true return under your hand, and not to fail.

Sect. 9. Whereas in the law, tit. Townships, the several towns, and selectmen of the said towns, have power to impose penalties as the law directs; and whereas many constables question whether it be their duty to serve warrants from the selectmen for persons to appear before them, and to levy fines; for the removal of such doubts, as an addition to the said law:

This court doth order and require, that all constables respectively shall serve all warrants from the selectmen, and levy all such fines as shall be imposed by the said town or selectmen. [1671.]

Sect. 10. Whether if a town see good to implead any person in a course of law, and make their vote to that end, and choose their attorney, it be not sufficient legal attorney-ship, and be allowed in court, the said attorney briuging a record of the said order or choice, signed by the hand of the

Defendant's book admitted as evidence against the plaintiffs demand.

Where as by an act made and passed in the fourth year of his present majesty’s reign, intitled an act to prevent unnecessary law suits, it is provided, «that where any person is sued in a plea of debt due by book, he may plead what is due upon his book, by way of balance to the plaintiff’s book,” upon which many doubts have arisen and may arise, wherefore, for the explanation thereof,

Sect. 1. Be it enacted and declared by his excellency the governor, council and representatives, in general court assembled, and by the authority of the same, that the true intent and meaning thereof is, that if any person bo sued in any action, either of debt or of the case, for any sum of money due upon contract between the parties for any goods sold or service done, whether the account be open, or a balance thereof be made and signed by the parties, except specialties and express contracts in writing, he may either plead specially, or upon the general issue give in evidence what is due upon his book by way of balance to the plaintiff’s demand, and be admitted to all such method and course of proving his account as any plaintiff upon his suit might.

And inasmuch as it hath sometimes happened, that when two persons have at the same time execution against each other, one of them absconds and leaves a power of attorney with some other person, to receive the money due on his execution, and by his absconding as aforesaid avoids paying the other execution.

For prevention whereof, and such like inconveniences for the future.

AN ACT IN EXPLANATION OF SUNDRY ACTS HERETOFORE MADE* REFERRING TO THE ADMISSION OF TOWN INHABITANTS.

Notwithstanding the provision made by the act passed in the twelfth and thirteenth years of king Williaqi the third, intitled an act directing the admission of town inhabitants,

“ that no town shall be obliged to be at charge for the sup* port of any person residing there, unless such person have continued iu such town, without being warned to depart thence, by the space of twelve months, or else have obtained the approbation of the town, or the selectmen thereof for his dwelling there,” yet, inasmuch as it is not expressly declared in what way and manner such approbation shall be given, some doubt hath thereupon arisen, whether the selectmen or assessors in any town their rating or assessing any person residing there to town charges, and the inhabitants reaping the benefit of his rate, ought not, within the meaning of the said act, to have the force of an approbation for such persons dwelling there, so far as to subject such town to the charge of his support in case he stands in need, by means whereof sundry disputes and expensive lawsuits have arisen and may arise, unless prevented by this court,

Sect. 2. Be it therefore declared and enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the words, all charges, in the said paragraph do extend to and include the charge of supporting the person so received and entertained, after be shall have continued his residence iu such town so long as to become an inhabitant, and that such charges may be recovered at any time after they have arisen, although the term limited for the continuance of the said act or acts may (at the time of bringing the suit) be expired.

Whereas it frequently happens in controversies upon book debts or single contracts, that when the action comes upon trial, the defendant pleads and urges payment, and as an evidence produces his account, and whereas the common practice is to give judgment without admitting any account in favour of the defendant, whereby he is necessitated to bring forward a suit himself, which occasions a further cost, and sometimes exposeth him to the loss of his debt by reason of the original plaintiff’s poverty and absconding.

Sect. 1. Be it therefore enacted by the governor, council and house of representatives, in general oourt assembled, that when and so often as any person is or shall be served with an original process in any action or plea, either of debt or of the case, for any sum of money due upon single contract between the parties, for any goods sold, or service done, due by account, whether such account be open or a balance thereof be made and signed by the parties, to appear before any justice of the peace or faforiour court of common pleas.

And to the intent the plaintiff may have sufficient importunity to examine and make all just objections to the defendant’s account,

Sect. 2. Be it further enacted, that no defendant shall be admitted to produce or give his account in evidence upon any suit or trial as above, in a cause triable before a justice • of the peace, unless he shall have left a copy of such account four days at least before the day of trial with the justice before whom the same is to be trieda and if the cause be before the inferiour court of common pleas, then a copy of hi9 account as above shall be left with the clerk of the eourt at least seven days before the day of the court’s sitting, and the justice of the peace and clerk of the court respectively are hereby directed and required at the desire of the plaintiff or his attorney to grant a copy of such account.

AH ACT TO PKHTSIT THE MULTIPLICITY OF LAWSUITS.

W here as of late it hath been the practice of some of the sheriffs, under-sheriffii,or their deputies within this province, to receive from some of the justices of the peace and tho clerks of the eourt within the respective counties blank writs, and then fill them up and serve them, and sometimes appearby virtue of a power of attorney to pttrsae the same, which practice has a tendency very much to Increase th*-number of lawsuits and to a partial administration of justice, for remedy whereof,

AN ACT FOR THE MORE EASY PARTITION OP LANDS OR OTHER REAL ESTATE, GIVEN BY WILL AND HELD IN COMMON AND UNDIVIDED AMONG TUB DEVISEES.

Whereas it is usual for persons by their last wills to devise their real estates to sundry of their children or others, to be divided to and amongst them in some certain proportion, a division whereof cannot be obtained by the act of the parties, by reason of their disagreement or some legal incapacity that some of them are under, and other methods for obtaining such partition are attended with charge, delay, and other inconveniences, to the prejudice of such estate, for remedy whereof.

Sect. 1. Be it enacted by the lieutenant governor, coun-The judge au^ *I0USC representatives, that when and so often as of probate any devisee, or his guardian, who holds any real estate, in empower- partnership with any other person or persons, by force of cd to di. any last will and testament, shall make application to the estate* judge of probate of wills, &c. in the county where such given by estates lie, for a division thereof, it shall and may be lawful will. for such judge of probate to order the whole of the real estate so devised, or that part of it the partition whereof is requested, to be divided to and amongst the devisees in proportion according to the will of the testator, by five good and discreet freeholders of the same county, to be appointed by the judge of probate, and to be sworn to the due performance of that service by the said judge, or by a justice of the peace of the same county, in case the estate to be divided be not within ten miles from the dwelling *house of the said judge, notice being first given to all parties concerned to be present at the making of such partition, if they see cause, which partition or division, being returned into the probate office, and approved by the judge, and there recorded, shall be valid in the law to all intents and purposes, unless upon the appeal of any party aggrieved at the partition so made, the same should be reversed or altered by the governor and council.

And whereas it sometimes happens that real estates, devised by will, lie in common and undivided with other real estate, and in order to a just and more convenient partition or division of the real estate so devised, it may be deemed necessary that partition or division should be first made between the estate so devised and the other estate lying in common therewith.

Sect. 2.Be it further enacted, that in every such case it shall and may be lawful for the judge of probate of wills, &c. in the county where such estate lies, to empower C* the five freeholders, appointed as aforesaid, first to make lands lie in partition or division between the lands or other real estate common, given by will and any other lands or real estate lying in common therewith, notice being first given to all parties as above directed, and the charge of the division of any estate vby virtue of this act, such charge being first settled and allowed by the judge, shall be borne by the several persons interested in proportion to their respective interests therein.

Provided, that no partition shall be made, where the proportion belonging to the devisees or any of them shall appear Provisoes by the tenor of the devise to be disputable and uncertain. j"d,8PuU-Provided also, that where any of the persons interested are c*’ea* minors, or out of the province, guardians be first appointed Guardians for stich minors according to law, and some discreet and Mintedfor indifferent person be appointed by said judge to represent minors out and act for such absent party, who shall be allowed twelve of the promonths to appeal to the governor and council from such vmce* judgment.

Sect. 1. Be it enacted by the governor, council and Complain- house of representatives, that each and every fence-viewer pay the10 within this province, and that hereafter may be chosen fence- into said office, shall be obliged, upon complaint made to vittwer be- him, to view any insufficient fences without the complain-fore he ant’s first paying him therefor, and in case the owner of

And whereas it often happens in fencing general fields for the convcnieney of fencing, considerable quantities of rocky and barren land, not capable of tillage, are taken into such fields, the owners of which are now by law obliged to fence for the same, and also pay taxes equal to the other lands in said field, whenever an assessment is made by the proprietors of such field, which is very unjust, therefore,

Sect. 3. Be it further enacted, that all lands now lying __ .

Whebeas it often happens that persons who have committed criminal offences in other of his majesty’s colonies, before they can be apprehended, flee into this province, and by that means, through the difficulty and delay that must generally attend a legal arrest of such offenders and sending them back for a proper trial, do escape the punishment their offences justly deserve, for preventing whereof and to render the proceedings in such cases more easy, legal, and expeditious for the future,

AN ACT IN ADDITION TO AN ACT MADE AND PASSED IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF KING WILLIAM THE THIRD, ENTITLED AN ACT FOR SUPPRESSING AND PUNISHING OF ROGUES, VAGABONDS AND COMMON BEGGARS, AND OTHER LEWD, IDLE' AND DISORDERLY PERSONS, AND FOR SETTING THE POOR TO WORK.

HERE as the execution of an act made and passed in the eleventh year of the reign of king William the third, entitled an act for the suppressing and punishing of rogues, vagabonds, common beggars, and other lewd, idle and disorderly persons, and abo for setting the poor to work, is oftentimes rendered very difficult by reason of the distance of the place where such persons arc found and taken up from the house of correction to which they are directed by said act to be sent in order for punishment, by means whereof such persons often escape without auy punishment, and thereby many such disorderly persons are encouraged to come from distant parts into this province, whereby his majesty’s good and industrious subjects here are frequently burdened and imposed on by such vagrant, idle and disorderly persons.

For the more effectual preventing whereof for the future.

Be it enacted by the lieutenant governor, council and Cou.rt house of representatives, that henceforward it shall be in or

Sect. 1. Be it enacted by the governor, council and house Judgment of representatives, that where any person or persons hereto-recovered fore have recovered or hereafter shall recover a judgment the nei°h- op ju<%ments in any court in any or either his majesty’s bouring * neighbouring colonies in America* and the person or persons, colonies to against whom such judgment or judgments has been or shall be prose, be recovered, has removed or shall hereafter remove into thhfpro. or re8^e within this province, or where such person or per-vince. sons, against whom such judgment or judgments have been or may be recovered in the colonies aforesaid, have heretofore acquired or hereafter shall acquire any real or personal estate within this province, that then and in every such case it shall and may lie lawful for such ereditor or creditors,who have so recovered or shall hereafter recover a judgment or judgments as aforesaid, to bring forward, support aod maintain an action or aetious of debt upon such judgment or judgments so recovered, or that shall be recovered in the neighbouring colonies as aforesaid, in any exeentive court within this province proper to try the same, in such way and manner as he or they might have done, if such judgment or judgments had been originally recovered in the executive court in this province where said action of debt shall be brought.

Sect. 1. The court taking into due and mature consideration, how necessary it will be that a dividend be forthwith made of some competent quantity of land in the London plantation in New England, both for the present accommodation of the people lately gone thither, as well to build them houses as to inclose and manure and feed their cattle on, have thought fit and ordered, that the governor, deputy and council there shall make a dividend accordingly ; and allot the same unto the several adventurers and others as followeth, viz. that two hundred acres of land be by them allotted to each adventurer for fifty pounds adventure in the common stock, and so after that rate and according to that proportion for more or less as the adventure is, to the intent they may build their houses and improve their labours thereon$ that every adventurer in the common stock, or his servant for him or on his behalf, shall make request or demand to the governor, or deputy and council, to have a proportion of land allotted unto him accordingly; and if within ten days after such request or demand made, the same be not set out and allotted unto him, then such person or persons are by virtue of this act permitted and authorised to seat him or themselves, and build his or their house or houses, and inclose and manure ground, in any convenient place or places not formerly built upon or manured, provided that the land so made choice of by any such person or persons do not exceed in quantity the one half of the land which is to be allotted unto him or them by dividend* according to this order above written, with

liberty also, when the first dividend shall be made, to take his or their allotment of land as others do, in lieu of this, if in the mean time the first choice shall be disliked by them or any of them.

Sect. 4. And to the end every adventurer may the more safely and peaceably enjoy their said lands allotted out to them, or chosen by them and the houses they build thereon as aforesaid, it is thought fit and ordered by the court, that conveyances shall be made thereof unto each particular man for the land he possesseth in the company’s name, and the

CHAPTER VI.

ARTICLES OR CONFEDERATION OF THE NEW ENGLAND COLONIES.

ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION BETWEEN THE PLANTATIONS UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS, THE PLANTATIONS UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW PLYMOUTH, AND THE PLANTATIONS UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF CONNECTICUT.

Inhere as we all came into these parts of America with one and the same end and aim, viz. to advance the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to enjoy the liberties of the gospel in purity with peace, aud whereas in our settling, by a wise providence of God, we are further dispersed upon the sea coasts and rivers than was first intended, so that we cannot according to our desire with conveniency communicate in one government and jurisdiction, and whereas we are compassed with people of several nations and strange languages, which hereafter may prove injurious to us and our posterity, and forasmuch as the natives have formerly committed sundry insolencies and outrages upon several plantations of the English, and have several times combined themselves against us, and seeing by reason of our distance from England, our dear native country, we are hindered both from that humble way of seeking advice and reaping those comfortable fruits of protection which we might otherwise well expect, we therefore account it our duty as well as safety to enter into a confederation for mutual help and succour in all our future concernments, that as in nation and religion, so in other respects we be and continue one, according to the terms and true meaning of the ensuing articles:

1. Wherefore it is agreed and concluded by and between the parties or jurisdictions abovenamed, and they do jointly and severally by these presents agree and conclude, that they all be and henceforth to be called by the name of the united colonies of New England.

2. The said united colonies, for themselves and their posterity, do jointly and severally hereby enter into a firm and perpetual league of friendship and amity, mutual advice and succour upon all just occasions, both for preserving and propagating the truth and liberties of the gospel and for their own mutual safety and welfare, provided notwithstanding that the power of determination of an offensive war properly

APPENDIX.

so called, so as to engage the colonies therein, shall be in the several general courts of the aforementioned confederates.

3. It is agreed, that the plantations which at present are or hereafter shall be settled within the limits of the Massachusetts shall be for ever under the government of the Massachusetts, and have peculiar jurisdiction amongst themselves as an entire body, and that Plymouth and Connecticut each of them in all respects have the like peculiar jurisdie-tion and government within their limits, according to their respective letters patent from his majesty, provided that no other jurisdiction shall hereafter be taken in as a distinct head or member of this confederation, nor shall any other plantation or jurisdiction in present being, and not already in combination or under the jurisdiction of any of these confederates, join in one jurisdiction without the consent of the several general courts of the abovenamed confederates.

4. It is also agreed, that for the managing and concluding of all affairs proper to and concerning the whole confederation not excepted against in these articles, two commissioners shall be chosen by and out of each of these three jurisdictions, viz. two for the Massachusetts, two for Plymouth, and two for Connecticut, being all in church fellowship with us, who shall bring full power from their general courts respectively to hear and examine, and weigh and determine the same; but if these six commissioners when met shall not all agree, yet it is concluded that any five of the six agreeing shall have power to settle and determine the ease in controversy, but if five do not agree, that then such propositions with their reasons so far as they have been debated be sent and referred to the several general courts, and if by all the said courts there be a concurrence in the matter so referred, then to be accordingly prosecuted by all the confederates and all their members.

5. It is further agreed, that the commissioners for the united colonies shall meet but once in three years except in cases extraordinary, which meeting shall ever be on the first Thursday in September, and that the next meeting after the date of these presents shall be at Plymouth, which shall be accounted the first meeting, the second at Boston, the third at Hartford, the fourth at Boston, the fifth at Hartford, and so the meeting will be but once in fifteen years at Plymouth, and double so often in the other colonies, if in the mean time some middle place be not found out and agreed on, which may be commodious for all.

6. It is further agreed, that at each meeting of these six commissioners, whether ordinary or extraordinary, they may choose their president out of themselves, whose office and work shall be to take care and direct for order and comely carrying of all proceedings in the present meeting; but he shall be invested with no such power by which he

APPENDIX.

nay hinder the proposing or progress of any business, or any way cast the scales otherwise than in the present articles is agreed.

7. It is also agreed, that the commissioners for this confederation hereafter at their meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, os they may bare commission or opportunity, may consult of and propose to the several general courts to be by them allowed and established, such orders, in general cases of a civil nature wherein all the plantations are interested, for preserving peace amongst themselves and preventing as much as may be all occasions of war or differences with others, as about the free and speedy passage of justice in each jurisdiction to all the confederates equally as to their own, receiving those that remove from one plantation to another, how all the jurisdictions may carry towards the Indians, that they neither grow insolent nor be injured without due satisfaction, lest war break in upon the confederates through such miscarriages; it is also agreed, that if any servant run away from his master into any other of these confederated jurisdictions, that in such case, upon the certificate of one magistrate in the jurisdiction out of which the said servant fled, or upon other due proof, the said servant shall be delivered either to his master or any other that pursues and brings such certificate or proof, and that upon the escape of any prisoner whatsover or fugitive for any criminal cause, whether breaking prison or getting from the officer, or otherwise escaping, upon the certificate of one magistrate of the jurisdiction out of which the escape is made, that he was a prisoner, or such an offender at the time of the escape, the magistrates or some of them of that jurisdiction where for tho present the said prisoner or fugitive abideth, shall forthwith grant such a warrant as tho case will bear for the apprehending any such person, and the delivering of him or her into the hand of the pursuer, and if help be required it shall be granted, he paying the charge thereof.

It is further agreed, that for the disposing of the Indian stock for the future, the choice of the commissioners of the several colonies being annually as formerly, the commissioners of the Massachusetts with such others arf shall be present, or any three of the commissioners, meeting yearly at Boston or elsewhere as they shall agree, and at the usual time, they may do any act for the managing and ordering of that affair as though all the commissioners were present, and what they shall do herein they shall keep a true record thereof, and transmit the account of the same from time to time to the triennial meeting of the commissioners.

9. It is agreed also by these confederates, that the charge of all just wars, whether offensive or defensive, upon what part or member of this confederation soever they fall, shall

APPENDIX.

726

Both in men, provisions and all other disbursements, he borne by all the parts of the confederation in different proportions according to their different abilities, viz. that the rule for proportioning men and raising of monies for the defraying of such charges as may from time to time arise upon any war defensive or offensive, begun and carried on according to the articles of confederation, shall be as follows: the Massachusetts one hundred, Plymouth thirty, Connecticut Sixty; and this rule to continue for fifteen years next coming after the beginning of the meeting of the commissioners to be held at Plymouth iu September next; and then if any one or more of the confederates shall apprehend the abovesaid proportion to be unequal, that then matters shall be again considered by the commissioners, and what they shall agree upon shall be presented to the several general courts for their acceptance and confirmation, each jurisdiction or plantation being left to their own just course and custom of rating themselves and people, and that according to the different charge of each jurisdiction and plantation; the whole advantage of the war, if it please God so to bless their endeavours, whether it be in lands, goods or persons, shall be proportionably divided amongst the said confederates.

10. it is further agreed, that if any of these jurisdictions or any plantation under them be invaded by any enemy whomsoever, upon any notice or request of any three magistrates of that jurisdiction so invaded, the rest of the confederates without any further meeting or expostulation shall forthwith send aid to the confederate iu danger, but in different proportions, viz. the Massachusetts one hundred men sufficiently armed and provided for such a service and expedition, Plymouth thirty men so armed and provided, and Connecticut sixty men so armed and provided, or any less number if less be required, according to this proportion ; but if such confederate in danger may be supplied by their next confederate not exceeding the numbers hereby agreed, they may crave help there and seek no further for the present, the charge to be borne by the several colonies according to the proportions abovesaid, and at their return to be victualled and supplied with powder and shot if there be need for their journey, by that jurisdiction that employed or sent for them; but in any such case of sending men for present aid, whether before or after such order or alteration, it is agreed that at the meeting of the commissioners for this confederation, the cause of such war or invasion be duly considered, and if it appear that the fault lay in the parties so invaded, that then that jurisdiction or plantation make just satisfaction both to the invaders whom they have injured, and bear all the charges of the war themselves, without re- ' quiring any allowance from the rest of the confederate* towards the same.

APPENDIX.

11. And for that the justest war may be of dangerous consequence especially to the smaller plantations in those united colonies, it is agreed, that neither the Massachusetts, Plymouth nor Connecticut, nor any of the members of any of them shall at any time hereafter begin, undertake or engage themselves or this confederation in any war whatsoever, sudden exigences with the necessary consequences thereof excepted, which are also to be moderated as much as the case will permit, without the consent of the several general courts of the united colonies.

12. It is also agreed, that in ease of any sudden exigences or other weighty occasions requiring the meeting of the commissioners before the ordinary time, the governor or any three magistrates of any of the confederate jurisdictions may summon a meeting of the commissioners, briefly signifying the occasion thereof and the time and place of the meeting, which shall be accordingly attended by the commissioners of all the confederate jurisdictions, and when met they may adjourn to any other time or place as they shall see meet.

13. It is also agreed, for settling of vagabonds and wandering persons removing from one colony to another, to the dissatisfaction and burden of the places where they come, as daily experience sheweth us, for the future it is ordered, that where any person or persons shall be found in any jurisdiction to have had their abode for more than three months, and not warned out by the authority of the place, and in case of the neglect of any person so warned as above-said to depart, if he be not by the first opportunity that the season will permit sent away from constable to constable, to the end that he may be returned to (he place of his former abode, every such person or persons shall be accounted an inhabitant where they are so found, and by them governed and provided for as their condition may require, and in all such eases the charge of the constables to be borne by the treasurer where the said constables do dwell.

14*. It is agreed, that if any of the confederates shall hereafter break any of these present articles, or be in any other way injurious to any of the confederate jurisdictions, such breach of agreement or injury shall be duly considered and ordered by the commissioners for the other jurisdictions, that both peace and this present confederation may be preserved without violation.

15. Whereas in the former articles agreed upon May the 29th, 1643, for the united colonies above named, Newhaven is therein mentioned, and was owned as a distinct confederate, and is by these included and concluded as one with Connecticut, the abovesaid union shall always be interpreted as by their own concession and not otherwise.

APPENDIX.

Now whereas for many years past upon divers good considerations there was a confederation agreed upon by the ancient English colonies under his majesty’s authority in New England for mutual help, support and defence, as also for the better maintaining his majesty’s interest against any opposition or incursion of the barbarous natives and others, as appeareth by articles that were agreed upon in the year 1643, and are upon record to be seen, whereby the said colonies have been so united as have proved very beneficial to all his majesty’s subjects in these parts for their peace and security, and whereas the several general courts of the said colonies have seen cause to renew the said confederation, with some necessary alteration and addition to the said articles, as is more fully expressed in the articles above written, and also whereas the general court for the Massachusetts colony, by their commission dated in Boston in August the 30th, 1672, have nominated Thomas Danforth, Esq. and Mqjor William Hawthorne, Esq. their commissioners investing them with full power and authority to sign, ratify and confirm the above recited articles of confederation, and in like manner the general court held at Plymouth June the 6th, 1672, have nominated Thomas Prence, Esq. and Major JosiaB Winslow, Esq. investing them with like power, and the general court of Connecticut colony held at Hartford May the 9th and June the 26th, 1672, have in like manner nominated John Winthorpe, Esq. and James Richards, Esq. investing them with like power, the abovesaid commissioners being assembled at Plymouth September the 5th, 1672, having read and examined these abovewritten articles, do according to their said commissions, and by virtue thereof, clearly and absolutely ratify and confirm the same, for the re-establishing of a perpetual confederation between the abovenamed colonies, as was the declared intentions of the former articles ; in confirmation whereof, the commissioners abovenamed, by the authority granted unto them from their several general courts, and in their name and stead have hereunto subscribed their hands, in Plymouth, September the 5th, 1672.

CHAPTER YU.

ftUNDRY QUESTIONS BY THE GENERAL COUET, PUT TO THE ELDERS RESPECTING THE POWERS OP GOVERNMENT, PENALTIES,

&C. A.D. 1644.

Question. Whether the magistrates are by patent and elections of the people the standing council of the commonwealth in the vacancy of the general court, and have power accordingly to act in all cases subject to government, accord* ing to the said patent, and the laws of this jurisdiction; and when any necessary occasions call for action from authority, in cases where there is no particular express law provided there, to be guided by the word of God, till the general court give particular rules in such cases.

Answer. The magistrates are by patent and election of the people the standing council of commonwealth in the vacancy of the general court, and accordingly act in all cases pertaining to government according to the patent and the laws made by the said general court of this jurisdiction ;this answer is grounded upon sundry passages in the said patent, where it is said that the governor, deputy-governor and assistants shall apply themselves to take care for the best disposing, and ordering of the general businesses and affairs of, for and concerning the lands and premises, and the plantation thereof, and the government of the people there; also it is said that the governor, deputy-governor and assistants, or any such number of them as there is expressed, shall be a full and sufficient court for the handling, ordering, and despatching of all such businesses and occurrences as shall from time to time happen, touching, or concerning the said company or plantation; and it is said, that it is in the power of the general court to make laws and ordinances for the good and welfare of the company; they may make and establish wholesome laws, statutes and ordinances, for the settling the forms and ceremouies of government and for managing and styling of all sorts of officers, superiour or inferiour, and for the distinguishing and setting forth of the several duties, powers and limits in every such office and place.

2dly. We do not find that by the patent they are expressly directed to proceed according to the word of God; but we understand that by a law, or liberty of the country, they may act in cases wherein as yet there is no express law, so that in such acts, they proceed according to the word of Gpd.

APPENDIX.

719

.Question. 'Whether the governor and assistants have any power by patent to dispense justice in the vacancy of the general court, without some law or order of the same, to declare the same ?

Answer. We do not find in the commonwealth now constituted by the patent, that the governor and assistants have any power to dispense justice in the vacancy of the general court, without some law or order of the same, as the rule of their ad ministration; which we conceive it were meet to be expressed, for the regulating of all particulars as far as may be, where such cannot be had, to be supplied by general rules.

Question. Whether any general court hath not power in particular cases to choose any commissioners, either assistants or freemen, exempting all others, to give them commission, to set forth their power and places. By any particular case, we mean in all things, and in the choice of ail officers that the commonwealth stands in need of between election and election, not taking away the people’s liberties in elections, nor turning out any officer so elected by them without showing cause ?

Answer. If the terras, all things, imply or intend all cases of constant judicature and counsel, we answer negatively, viz. that the general court hath not power by patent, iu all such-cases, to choose any officers or commissioners, either assistants or freemen, exempting, that is excluding all others, to give them commission, to set forth their power and places ; because it would then follow that the magistrates might be excluded from all cases of eonstaut judicature and counsel, which are their principal work, whereby also the end of the people’s election would be made frustrate.

2dly. But if these terms, all things, imply, and intend cases, whether occasional or otherwise, belonging neither to constant judicature nor council, we answer affirmatively.

The general court hath power by patent, in such particular cases, to choose any officers and commissioners, either assistants or freemen, exempting all others, to give the commission, to set forth their power and places, which yet we understand with the distinction, &e. that if the affairs committed to such officers and commissioners be of general concernment, we conceive the freemen, according to patent, are to choose them, the general court to set forth their power and places; but if the affairs committed to such officers or commissioners be of merely particular concernment, then we conceive the general court may both choose theiq, and set forth their power and places.

Whereas we give cases of constant judicature and counsel to the magistrates, we thus interpret the word counsel. Counsel consists of care and action. In respect of care, the magistrates are not limited. In respect of action^ they are 92

APPENDIX.

to be Hmitod by the genera! court, as the supreme council. Finally, it is oar humble request, that in ease any difference grow in the general court between magistrates and deputies, either in those or any like weighty cases, which cannot be presently issued with mutual peace, that then both parties will bo pleased to defer the same to further deliberation, for the honour of God and of the court.

The 12th of the 9th month, 1644.

Question 1. Whether the deputies in the general court have judicial and magistratieal power ?

2. Whether by patent, the general eourt, consisting of magistrates and deputies, as a general court, have judicial or magistratieal authority ?

Answer 1. The patent in express words giveth full power and authority, as to the governor and assistants, so to tho freemen also, assembled in general eourt.

2. Whereas there is a threefold power of magistratieal authority, legislative, judicative, and consultive, or directing of the publick affairs of the country, for provision and protection ; the first of these, namely, legislative, is expressly given to the freemen jointly with the governor and assistants. Consultive or directive power of the pnbliek affairs of the commonwealth, for provision and protection, is granted also by patent to the freemen, as to the governor and assistants. But now for power,'a judicature, if we speak of the constant and usual administration thereof, we do not find that it is granted to the freemen or deputies in the general court, either by the patent, or by the election of tho people, or by any law of the country. But if we speak of the occasional administration thereof, we find power of judicature administrate by the freemen jointly with the governor and assistants, upon a double occasion, first, in case of defect or delinquency of a magistrate, we find the whole general court, of governor, deputy-governor, assistants and freemen, may proceed to remove him.

Secondly. If by the law of the country, there lie any appeal to the general eourt, or any other special oause be referred to their judgment, it will necessarily infer, that in such eases, by such laws, the freemen jointly with the governor and assistants have power of judicature, touching the appellants, and cause of the appeal, and those reserved cases.

What we speak of the power of freemen by patent, the same may be said of the deputies, so far forth as the power of the freemen is delegated to them by order of law.

'Question 3. Whether we may warrantably prescribe certain penalties to offences which may probably admit variable degrees of guilt ?

APPENDIX.

mi

4. Whether a judge be bound to pronounce such sentence ns a positive law prescribes, in case it be apparently above «p beneath the merit of the offence ?

Answer 1. Certain penalties may, and ought to be prescribed to capital crimes, although they may admit variable degrees of guilt, as in case of murtker upon prepensed malice, and upon sudden provocation, there is prescribed the same death in both; though murther upon prepensed malice be a far greater guilt, than upon sudden provocation, Num. xxxv. 16,17,18, with 20, 21; also in crimes of less guilt, as in theft, though some theft be of greater guilt than others, as for some man to steal a sheep who hath less need, is of greater guilt than for another who hath more need ; the Lord prescribed the same.measure of restitution in both, Exod. xxii.

2. In case variable circumstances of an offenec do so much vary the degrees of guilt, as that the offence is raised to an higher nature, there the penalty must be varied to an v higher answerable proportion. The striking of a neighbour may be punished with some pecuniary mulct, when the striking of a father may be punished with death. So any sin committed with an high hand, as the gathering of sticks on the sabbath day, may be punished with death, when a lesser punishment might serve for gathering sticks privily, and in some need.

3. In case circumstances do so vary a sin, as that many sins are complicated, or wrapped up in it, the penalty is to be varied acconling to the penalty of those several sins; a single lie may be punished with a less mulct, than if it be told before the judgment seat, or elsewhere, to the damage of any person, whether in his good name by slander, or in his estate by detriment in his commerce, in which case a lie, aggravated by circumstances, is to be punished with respect both to a lie and a slander, and to the detriment which another sustained thereby.

*. In case that the circumstances which vary the degrees of guilt concern only the person of the offender, as whether it was his first offence or customary, whether he was enticed thereto or the enticer, whether he were principal or accessory, whether unadvised or witting and willing, fee. there it were meet that the penalties should be expressed, with a latitude whereof the lowest degree to be expressed, suppose five shillings, or as the case may be, five stripes; and the highest degree twenty shillings, or forty shillings, or stripes, more or less, within which compass or latitude it may be free to a magistrate to aggravate or mitigate the penalty, as the circumstances do aggravate or alleviate the offence; yet even here care should be taken that a magis. trate attend in his sentence as much as may be to certain rule in those circumstances, lest some person whose sins be alike circumstantiated with another, if his punishment be

APPENDIX.

m

not equal the one with the other, one may think himself more unequally dealt withal than another.

5. In those cases wherein a judge is persuaded in conscience that a crime deserveth a greater punishment than the law inflicteth, he may lawfully pronouuce sentence according to the present penalty of the law, because he hath no power committed to him by law to go higher 5 but where the law may seem to the conscience of the judge to inflict a greater penalty than the offence deserveth, it is his part to' suspend his sentence by conference with the lawgivers, till lie find liberty either to inflict the sentence or to mitigate it.

6. The penalties of great crimes may sometimes be mitigated by such as are in chief power, which in this country is the general court, out of respect to the publick good service which the delinquent hath done to the state in former times; so Solomon mitigated the punishment of Abiathar, for his service done to his father formerly. 1 Kings ii» 26, 27.

The 13 t the 9th , 1644.

Question 1. Whether the distinction of power of authority in the magistrates, and only liberty of counsel in the people, be according to the patent, with respect to the magistrates and deputies in the general court ?

Answer. We conceive that by patent, as the people have liberty of counsel, so they have also other power of authority in such manner as we have expressed in our answer to the two first questions sent unto us by our honoured magistrates.

Question 2. Whether the general court, consisting of magistrates and deputies, be not the chief power of this commonwealth; and to describe the power of magistracy, and prescribe laws to all, and do all other acts which belong to such a power ?

Answer. The general court, consist ing of the magistrates and deputies, is the chief civil power of this commonwealth, so as to describe the power of the magistracy and to preserve, in a civil way, laws unto all not repugnant to the laws of God nor the patent, nor to the fundamental laws and liberties established in the commonwealth, and accordingly may do all other acts which belong to such a power, as namely, both acts of counsel tending to the provision and protection and welfare of the whole body, and also arts of judgment so far as according to our answer to the two former questions of our honoured magistrates, is by the patent or choice of the people, or by the laws of the commonwealth reserved to them, and seated in them.

Question 3. Whether our government be a pure aristocracy, or mixed with a democracy; if mixed, whether H should not be mixed in all administrations of the same ?

APPENDIX.

733

Answer. Oar answer is, not a pure aristocracy, but mixed of an aristocracy and democracy in respect of the general court; yet it followetknot necessarily thereupon, that it should be mixed in all other courts and administrations thereof, because our form (as all other forms of civil government) is the ordinance of man; therefore as it was free to make it mixed or simple, so also to make it mixed in the general court aud unmixed in others, according to the pleasure of the ordainers thereof. Accordingly our patent, notwithstanding it bath made our government mixed, in respect of the genera] court, yet it seems to have instituted subordinate administrations of justice, to be discretionally dispensed by the eourt of assistants ? yet even in these courts there is some place for a democratical dispensation in respect of the jurors.

It was Toted, and all the answers given in by the reverend elders to the several questions were approved just and true answers to satisfaction, except such as are not put to vote:

That the assistants have no power to act in judicature without some law of the general court to declare the rule.

That the assistants have no power to act in judicature without some leave, either particularly expressed, or in general terms in defect thereof enacted by the general court as the rule of their administration.

That the general court, consisting of magistrates and deputies, is the chief civil power of this commonwealth, and may act in all things belonging to such a power, both concerning counsel in consulting about the weighty affairs of this commonwealth and concerning making of laws; also concerning judicature, in orderly impeaching, removing and sentencing any officer, even the highest, according to Jaw; likewise in receiving appeals, whether touching civil or criminal cases, wherein appeals are or shall be allowed by the general court.

That no magistrate hath power to vary from the penalty of any law, either to mitigate or exceed the same.

That no magistrate hath power to vary from the penalty expressed in any law, either to mitigate or exceed the same, without consulting with the general court.

That the patent in express words giveth full power and authority as to the governor and assistants, so to the freemen also assembled in the general court.

That that full power, which is described by the patent and granted to the general court, is given not only to the governor and assistants, but also to the freemen there assembled, and acting with common consent.

That certain penalties may and ought to be prescribed in diverse cases, although the offences admit of variable degrees of guilt.

AN ACT, Ilf ADDITION TO AND IN EXPLANATION OF SUNDRY CLAUSES OF AN ACT, ENTITLED AN ACT TO ASCERTAIN TUX TALUE OF MONEY AND OF THE BILLS OF PUBLICK CREDIT OF THIS PROVINCE, &C. MADE AND PASSED IN THE FIFTEENTH YEAR OF HIS MAJESTY'S REIGN.

W here as in the law for ascertaining the value of money and of the bills of publick credit of this province, passed in the fifteenth year of his majesty’s reign, it is enacted, that all debts contracted after the last day of March, A.D. 1742, (specialties and express contracts excepted) should be deemed equal to lawful money, and every debt of six shillings and eight pence value so contracted should or might be discharged by one ounce of silver, or six shillings and eight pence of the bills of publick credit emitted that year, or that should thereafter be emitted, equal in value to an ounce of silver, provided nevertheless, that in case such bills should be depreciated below the value they were stated at by said act, that an addition should be made of so much more as would make them equal to the then fixed value aforesaid, and the judges of the superiour court, agreeable to the directions of the aforesaid law, have made inquiry by a committee for that purpose appointed, who have certified into the secretary’s office, that seven shillings and two pence of the bills of credit of the last form and tenor is equal to one ounce of silver, in consequence whereof judgments have been made up in several courts on debts contracted since the last day of March aforesaid at that rate, whereby an addition of six pence is made to the creditor on every debt of six shillings and eight pence value, and whereas by said certificate compared with the rates of bills of exchange in March aforesaid, it is manifest that the said bills are not depreciated below the value they passed at when first emitted, in as much as six shillings and eight pence in said bills will now go as far in purchasing bills of exchange as when said act was made, and the aforesaid loss has happened to the debtor from his not strictly attending the direction of said law, whereby every debt of six shillings and eight pence is deemed equal to an ounce of silver, specialties and express contracts excepted* and should have been considered by the debtor at the time of contracting such debt as if the same had been payable in lawful money, and whereas the bills of publick credit current in this province are at present the only medium of the common trade and business within it, there will be con-

tinual danger of the debtor’s computing his debt according to the depreciated value of such bills, whilst it is deemed by said law to be contracted for lawful money, and thereby great damage may eusue to debtors contrary to the true intent aud meaning of the said law, wherefore.

Be it enacted by the governor, council and house of repre-aentativea, that all debts contracted since the last of March, be* A.D. one thousand seven hundred and forty-two, or that deemed shall hereafter be contracted* specialties and express eon- according tracts excepted, shall be deemed and adjudged equal to the J v*J“e of real value only such hills have passed or shall pass at when each debt was or shall be contracted; and every debt of tracted. twenty shillings contracted as aforesaid shall or may be always hereafter discharged by twenty shillings in said bills, and so pro rata for a greater or less sum, unless such bills have already or should hereafter be depreciated below the Saving no value they passed at when such debt was or shall be oontrae-ted ; and in such case so much shall always be allowed by JepneSa*- the respective courts in this province as shall make said bills equal in value to such debt when contracted ; any thing eon*, tained in the aforesaid law to the contrary notwithstanding.

CHAPTER XXVII.

AM ACT XN FURTHER ADDITION TO AN ACT, ASCERTAINING THE VALUE OF MONEY, AND OF THE BILLS OF PUBLICS ORE. D1T OF THIS PROVINCE.

W he he as, notwithstanding the provision that is made in and by an act, passed in the fifteenth year of his present majesty’s reign, entitled an act to ascertain the value of money, and of the bills of publick credit of this province,

fronted this present year for the supply of the treasury, and >r securing the credit of said bills, for securing to any creditor or creditors what the bills of credit might sink or depreciate in their value between the time of contracting the debt and the payment thereof, it has been a frequent practice for creditors to exact afid take of their debtors for the loan of any sum or sums of money lent, and for forbearance of their debts, more than six per cent., by which practice some of the good and wholesome laws of this province, and the equitable intent and designs of them are eluded, and great op-96

precision and injastiee introduced, to the reproach of this* government, now, for the prevention thereof for the future. Sect. 1. Be it enacted by the governor, council and house *low' of’representatives, that in all actions hereafter to be brought made'for f°p ^e recovering any debt or sum due upon bond, or other* the depre* wise contracted and payable in bills of credit since the ciating of thirty-first day of March, one thousand seven hundred and the bills forty-two, or that may be contracted within five years of that thingVuf date, if the debtor will tender his oath in court, that the been ai- creditor has received any thing for the loan or forbearance lowed ai- of such debt either in money, bills, goods, or by any new ready for bon(], bill, note of hand, order, or under colour of being paid for any service or thing, or by keeping back any part of the sum specified to be paid in the condition of any bond or other specialty, or by any other way or means whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, more than six pounds for the loan or forbearance of one hundred pounds for a year, and so after that rate for a greater or less sum, or for a longer or shorter time, then and in such case, unless the owner will make oath to the contrary, judgment shall be made up only for the. exact nominal sum received by or due from the debtor, with lawful interest for the same, if it bo payable with interest, but if the creditor will tender and actually give his oath as aforesaid, then judgment shall be entered up for the full value of said debt, as it was at the time of contracting the same.

And whereas there may be debts and sums payable in bills of credit or lawful money yet due and owing from man to man, that were contracted before the said thirty-first day of March, one thousand seven hundred and forty-two, and no provision made in the law for making good to the creditors what the bills, in which such debts or sums might be discharged, have depreciated or fallen, and inasmuch as it appears just and equal that the loss and damage arising to such creditors by the falling and depreciating of the bills of credit since the said thirty-first day of March, should be made good,

Sect. 2. Be it further enacted, that in all such cases it Provision shall be in the power of the justices of the several courts g!>rJd tiieff within this province, to make up judgment for such addi-vaiue of tional sum or sums as the said bills shall be found to have the debts depreciated from the said thirty-first day of March, until March ^ie ^rae of making up such judgment, but not for any other <31, 1743. or longer time, in which judgment the same rule shall be. observed as in case of debts contracted after the said thirty-first day of March, as in this act is before provided; saving always to the debtor the same relief in case he has In any manner or way, directly or indirectly, paid or allowed more than six per cent, as aforesaid, as is provided for him in this

act respecting any debt or sum that was contracted or agreed upon after the said thirty-first day of March.

And whereas many of his majesty’s subjects in this province, from an apprehension that the bills of credit of the new tenor were to be valued, taken and esteemed as lawful money, fjpom which apprehensions many persons have obliged themselves by their bonds and otherways, to pay lawful money where nothing but said bills were received, or goods for which the creditor would have received bills in payment, nor was any thing else intended or expected by either party at the time of contracting the debt, notwithstanding which some of the executive courts of this province have, contrary to the expectation and intention of the parties as aforesaid, made up their judgments on said debts for lawful money only, and construed the same not to be payable in said bills, whereby the debtor has been capable of discharging or satisfying the execution only with silver, the extreme scarcity of which renders it almost impracticable to satisfy the debt without paying such additional sum to the creditor as he Will be pleased to take in said bills, much to the debtor's oppression, which this government ought to prevent, wherefore,

Sect. s. Be it enacted, that when any sum or sums of money, due or contracted for since the first emission of the said new tenor bills in the year one thousand seven hundred and forty-one, or that shall be contracted for within the space of five years from that date, on bond, bill, note or otherwise, whether with interest or without, if the debtor will tender his oath that he received of the creditor no silver on which said debt or sum then sued for arose, or that it was not agreed by the parties that silver should be paid in discharge of such debt or sum due, that then and in every such case, unless the creditor will bona fide make oath that silver was received or agreed for, and understood, and intended to be paid by the parties at the time of contracting the said debt or agreement for the sum sued for, the judgment shall be given for bills of credit or lawful money at the debtor's election, allowing in such judgment for what the said hills may have depreciated from the thirty-first day of March, one thousand seven hundred and forty-two, to the time the judgment is made up.

Saving always, to the debtor the same relief in cases of this nature which is by this act already provided for him, where more than six per cent, has been paid for the loan or forbearance of any sum as aforesaid. [November, 1741.]

Judgment to be given only for bills where silver was not lent or received.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

AN ACT IK FURTHER ADDITION TO AND TOR EXPLANATION Of CERTAIN CLAUSES IN THREE SEVERAL ACTS HEREINAFTER MENTIONED, MADE AND PASSED IN THE FIFTEENTH, SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH TEARS OF HIS PRESENT MAJESTY’S REIGN, FOR ASCERTAINING THE TALUK OF MONET, AND OF THE BILLS OF FUBLICE CREDIT OF THIS PROVINCE.

Whereas In nnd by an act made and passed in the fifteenth year of his present majesty’s reign, entitled an act to ascertain the value of money and of the hills of publick credit of this province granted this present year for the supply of the treasury and tor securing the credit of said bills, the several eeurts of judicature are directed, in making up judgments for debts that should be contracted within the term of five years therein limited, except as therein excepted, in ease the province bills by said net emitted, or that should thereafter be emitted, should be depreciated below the value they were set at by said act, to allow the creditor so much in said bills as should make amends for their depreciation below their then stated value, or the value at which such other bills should be stated, and whereas in the rule by said act prescribed for determining the value of such bills from time to time for the purpose aforesaid, only silver and lulls of exchange are made the standard whereby said bills are to be estimated in order te the payment of private debts to be contracted within the time aforesaid, which rule by experience has been found to be unequal, and not to answer the good intention of the said act, inasmuch as the bills of credit, being the only medium of trade and commerce in this and the other governments in New England, their value cannot be truly estimated by the prices of any one or two particular commodities or merchandises, such as bills of exchange and silver, now are and have for several years past been within this and the aforesaid other colonies, and the prices of which in bills of publiok credit have been found liable to be very suddenly and immoderately increased by a few persons for the sake of serving their own particular trade or interest, whereby the bills of credit have often been to the great grievance of debtors much depreciated with respect to bills of exchange and silver, though at the same time they have kept their value with respect to all other commodities and merchandizes in this province.

APPENDIX

Now for preventing any future inconvenience which may arise to the debtor from estimating the value of bills of credit by comparing them with the prices of bills of exchange and silver alone.

Sect. 1. Be it enacted by the governor, council and house of representatives, that when any valuation shall be made of the bills of publick credit on this province in pursuance to'ht of said aet, and for the purposes therein mentioned, regal'd considered shall be had not only to silver and bills of exchange, but to in the rathe prices of provisions and other necessaries of life, and to the difference that may arise from the plenty or scarcity of them, or other circumstances which may casually occasion the rise or fhll of them at the respective seasons wherein such valuation shall be made as aforesaid.

And whereas the aforementioned act directs that the valuation of the bills of publick credit as aforesaid, for the purposes aforesaid, shall be made once in every six months by the general assembly, and in want thereof by a committee consisting of the eldesit counsellor for the time being, in each of those counties where any member of his majesty’s council is an inhabitant, and whereas the said act doth not expressly deelare that the determination made by any number of the said committee short of the whole shall be accounted valid for the purposes aforesaid, aud doubts and disputes have thereupon arisen, for prevention whereof for the future,

Sect. 2. Be it enacted by the governor, council and house Fiw of representatives, that any five of the said counsellors shall Ml)on to be a quorum, and every valuation of the bills of publick be a quo. credit to be made by the whole number of the said counsel-lors, or the major part of such of them as shall oonvene and JheXlli. be present at the time of making the same, provided the umber present be not less than five, and that due notice has been previously given to the rest that shall then be within this province of the time, place, and occasion of their meeting, shall be deemed and counted valid in the law for the purposes in said aet mentioned.

And whereas although the method of making up judgment on private debts, with allowance for the sinking of the value of the province bills, as prescribed in the aforesaid aet, and in another act made and passed in the eighteenth year of his present majesty’s reign, entitled an aet in further addition to an aet for ascertaining the value of money, and of the bills of publiok credit of this province, is limited to debts contracted within or before certain periodi mentioned in said acts respectively, and is not extended to debts thereafter to be contracted, yet unless some certain term of time be limited for calling in such debts, and for the continuance of the aforesaid method of making up judgment thereupon, many of said debts may be long outstanding, and

tw

in consequence thereof it 'will be requisite* for a rule to the executive courts in their proceedings* that a valuation of said bills be from time to time made either by the general assembly or such others as by law are appointed for that service* till every of those debts shall be diseharged* how long soever that time may be protracted* to the hindrance and interruption of the publick affairs of the province, or to the great trouble* expense and loss of time to those concerned therein* for prevention of which and other inconveniences,

. . Sect. S. Be it enacted by the governor* council and house of the^me representatives* that in all and every action and actions

for bring, which shall be brought from and after the last day of Sep-ing actions tember, which will be in the year of our Lord one thousand •n this set. geven hundred and forty-nine* the aforementioned method of making up judgments in the several executive courts of this province* on all debts and dues contracted before the last day of March* one thousand seven hundred and forty-seven* by virtue or in consequence of the power and directions given in the aets aforesaid* or either of them, shall cease and determine, and no allowance shall be made in making String, up such judgments for any depreciation of the bills of credit* unless the debt on which such action shall arise did not become payable till after the last day of September anno Domini one thousand seven hundred and forty-nine* or unless the creditor now be and shall continue out of this pro-viuce till after the expiration of the said term, and have no lawful agent or attorney therein, or be a person non compos mentis, and have no lawful guardian, or be under some other legal incapacity of bringing his action for the recovery of such debt within the term herein before limited for that purpose ; and if after that term suit shall be brought for any such debts* judgments shall be made up according to tho last valuation that shall have been then made.

And whereas in and by an act made and passed in the seventeenth year of his present majesty's reign, entitled an act in addition to and in explanation of sundry clauses of an aet entitled an act to ascertain the value of money, and of the bills of publick credit of this province, made and passed in the fifteenth year of his majesty's reign, it is enacted, «that all debts contracted since the last of March one thousand seven hundred and forty-two, or that shall thereafter be contracted* specialties and express contracts excepted, shall be deemed and adjudged equal to the real value only such bills have passed or shall pass at when such debt was or shall be contracted, and every debt of twenty shillings contracted as aforesaid shall or may be always hereafter diseharged by twenty shillings in said bills, and so pro rata for a greater or less sum, unless such kills have already, or should hereafter be depreciated below the value they passed

»t when such debt was or shall be contracted, and la such case so much shall always be allowed by the respective courts in this province as shall make said bills equal in value to such debt when contracted/’

And whereas the debts referred to in the said act appear by the purview thereof to be such only as then had been or should be contracted within five years from the last day of March one thousand seven hundred and forty-two, yet as the said aet has by some been construed to extend to debts to be contracted after the expiration of said term, and in consequence of such construction, if admitted, many inconvenient ees may arise,

Wherefore for prevention thereof, and for removing any doubts or disputes touching the meaning of said aet in the case before mentioned.

Sect. 4. Be it enacted and declared by the governor. Time for council and house of representatives, that the debts referred contract-to and intended in the last herein before recited act are such ing debts only as had been or should be contracted within the before-mentioned term of five years from the last day of March one fit upon thousand seven hundred and forty-two, and that the rule deprecia-therein given to the courts of judicature respecting the tion of the allowance to be made for the depreciation of the bills of publick credit was intended, and shall be adjudged, construed and taken to be restrained to debts contracted within the term aforesaid, and not to extend to any other whatsoever.

TVhereas the petitions of the united colonies to George the third, king of Great Britain, for the redress of great and manifest grievances have not only been rejected, but treated with scorn and contempt, and their opposition to designs evidently formed to reduce them to a state of servile subjection, and their necessary defence against hostile forces actually employed to subdue them have been declared rebellion, and whereas an unjust war has been commenced against them, which the commanders of British Beets and armies have prosecuted and still continue to prosecute with their utmost vigour in cruel manners, and have directed their vengeance principally against this colony, wasting, spoiling and destroying the country, burning houses and defenceless towns, and exposing the helpless inhabitants to every misery, by which inhuman and barbarous treatment, by the commandment of George the third, king of Great Britain, &c. the people of this colony consider themselves greatly injured, and have been obliged to have recourse to arms to repel such injuries, and whereas under such circumstances the absurdity of issuing commissions, writs, processes and other proceedings in law and in the courts of justice within this colony in the name and style of the king of Great Britain is very apparent, and the tendency it has to keep up

CHAPTER XLIII.

AN ACT FOR PROVIDING A REINFORCEMENT TO THE AMERICAN

ARMY.

VV here as the state of our publick affairs claims our most serious attention, and while our inveterate enemies are using their utmost efforts to subjugate us not only to an arbitrary but ignominious government, in which our taskmasters may be those tools of power whom no laws could deter from the most flagitious crimes, and who have been ready at all times to sacrifice their country to their own emolument, it obviously becomes the duty of this assembly to make every possible provision against so great a calamity,

And whereas the time for which a part of the militia of this state is engaged to serve as a reinforcement to the continental army is near expiring, and it is apprehended that another reinforcement may be necessary, when a movement of the whole militia would be both needless and impractica- • ble, this court in faithfulness to this state has therefore thought proper to point out and establish the following method for determining what persons shall hold themselves in readiness to march first on this occasion,

Sect. 1. And it is enacted by the council and house of representatives, in general court assembled, and by the au- No person thority of the same, that no rank or station in life, place, e*‘ employment or office, except as is hereafter excepted, shall 'erv-excuse or exempt any person from serving in arms for the ing, ex. defence of his country, either by himself or some able bodied cePt*

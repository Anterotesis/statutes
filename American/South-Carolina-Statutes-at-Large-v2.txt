A

ADVERTISEMENT CONCERNING THE NUMBERING OF

THE ACTS.

The original manuscript Public Acts, are numbered for many years in regular succession, in red ink; but there are occasionnl omissions and interruptions in the series of the numbers. The Private Acts are numbered separately; and for some years a class was made of Temporary Acts (T. A.) not regularly continued ; these also were separately numbered. From the year 1719, the numbering ceases; — the last number of the public Acts is 390, on the manuscript original. The numbers adopted by Chief Justice Trott, in his folio collection of the Laws of South Carolina, 1736, follow the original manuscripts so far as No. 181, or to the year 1700-1, page 85 of Trott’s Laws. Judge Grimke in his collection of the Public Laws of South Carolina (quarto, 1790) pursues the original numbering so far as No. 185, A.D. 1700-1. Thenceforward the two collectors neither agree with the original manuscripts nor with each other. Judge Grimke’s collection of the Public Laws commences with No. Ill, A.D. 1694, omitting all the previous Acts; and he proceeds, but with so many omissions of Acts and sections and paragraphs, without laying before his reader satisfactory authority for these omissions, that his work cannot be regarded as authority. The able digest of Judge Brevard, is too much of an abridgement to be satisfactory to an accurate lawyer. Hence the necessity of laying before the public a collection that shall really fulfil the title of The Statutes at Large of South Carolina, as the only satisfactory basis for the reasonings of the Court and the Bar, and for the future operations of the Legislature in altering, amending improving, or condensing the Statute Law of the State, as it now imperfectly and confusedly exists.

The original manuscript Acts, when I have done with them, I shall deposit in the Secretary’s office ; and to render them checks on the accuracy of the present publication, I have rejected the numbers of Trott and Grimke, and followed in that respect, and in all possible cases, the numbering of the original Acts. But these numbers are not always to be found on the Acts that exist; and so many of the older Acts in manuscript, are lost, destroyed, defaced, or mutilated, from various accidents, that the numbering adopted in the present edition, must be of necessity in many cases conjectural. In such cases, I have carefully looked over the series of Acts of the session, and then consulting the previous. numbers of the original Acts, and the discrepant

IV

arrangements of Trott and Grimke, I have assigned the number wanting, upon a careful consideration of the best evidence the nature of the case afforded me. The class of Temporary Acts (T. A.) being numbered separately, renders an uniform and regularly consecutive system of numbering impossible to be adhered to throughout. The temporary Acts are also public Acts, but they are neither classed or numbered as public Acts. In fact, in the early period of our legislation, nine-tenths of all our public Acts Avere temporary; very few of them being enacted for more than two years, which period was afterwards extended (if deemed expedient) by continuing and reviving Acts. Wherever the introduction of temporary Acts has created an unavoidable anomaly in the numbering, it is noticed : so that the consultation of the original manuscripts, where they exist, will be easy to those who wish to avail themselves of the Acts deposited. Many of the Acts included in the series of Trott and Grimke, are contained in the first volume of this edition.

The present edition of the Statutes at Large, will doubtless contain many Acts that have been repealed, which have expired, or become obsolete, and therefore in a great measure useloss. Let this be determined by the only competent authority, the Legislature. To the history of our legislation, a collection like the present is absolutely necessary. Nor ought any compiler to exercise without authority a legislative function, however plain the case may be.

The original manuscript Acts have no marginal summaries to the sections; where these are wanting, I have supplied them.

An Ordinance of the Assembly, of September 21, 1721, numbered 455 in this edition, directed a committee to be appointed to revise the law3 ; and contemplated the possibility of the work not being completed within oite year. It appears from Trott’s collection, p. 382, that the whole number of Acts that had £then been passed, was 471. Of the proceedings of this committee, if any took place, no record remains. One hundred and sixteen years have now passed since that committee was raised. It was appointed to act on the legislation of thirty-eight years, when the infancy of the Colony, under the English laws, required but few additions. The public laws to the period of the Constitution in 1790, amount to sixteen hundred. The number of public Acts from 1790 to 1836, are about one thousand.

Neither of these collections gives the respective Acts full and complete. The Compilers have rejected the Laws and parts of Laws which they found to have been repealed, or which they considered as obsolete. A work fulfilling the title of the Statutes at Large, remains therefore a desideratum. The present Editor has proposed to publish such a collection, as completely as the existing materials will permit.

The original Acts from No, 1, to No. 22, are not now to be found. They extend from 1682 to 1685. Some of the others are so obscure from age, from dampness, or in other respects so mutilated, as not to be every where legible. In copying them, the Editor has avoided inserting any words from mere inference or conjecture, although he has occasionally made out a dubious passage by collation. Where he has been com-* pelled to omit a few words from defect in the manuscript, he has substituted asterisks, — * * *

The remarks of Chief Justice Trott, and Judge Grimke, on the various acts and sections of acts, as being obsolete or otherwise, are preserved. They are to be regarded and respected as the opinions of able and learned Judges, deliberately formed on a purview of the acts in their connection ; but not as authority to render any act obsolete which the legislature has not thought fit to repeal. That authority is (in the opinion of the present Editor) not to be conceded even to the decisions of the judicial bench. It would be desireable, if the Judges of the Appeal Court were to report annually to the Legislature such defects and alterations in the Statute Law, as the practical experience of those VOL. II. — I,

STATUTES AT LARGE

Judges might point out as deserving of legislative notice. This would in time, take away the temptation to judicial legislation, which under existing circumstances it is not easy to avoid.

The attestations of the Governor and other public functionaries by whom the acts are signed, are accompanied in the original manuscripts by their seals; which, of course, are here omitted. It seemed useless to the Editor to repeat the L. S. (Locus Sigilli) after every name.

The Editor submitted to the Judiciary Committee of 1835, the propriety of inserting all the acts from 1682 to 1694 of which the original manuscripts could be found in a legible state. That committee recommended their insertion; and properly, as the collection would not fulfil the title it assumes, if they were purposely omitted. But as these laws may be considered as obsolete, or repealed, or superceded in great part, if not altogether, by subsequent legislation, the Editor has commenced his series of notes and references at the period which the members of the profession have been in the habit of regarding as introducing the laws actually in force, viz, 1694, when Grimke’s collection commences.

The notes and references are principally confined to the decisions that have taken place in the Courts of our own State.

The acts are numbered in conformity with the red ink numbering of the public laws, in the original manuscripts, so far as that system of numbering regularly extends. They are then numbered in the order of their insertion in this work, without regaid to the numbers adopted by Trott and Grimke, which neither conform regularly to each other, or to the numbers in the original Acts. As this work will probably supercede the labours of those Editors, the numbers are adapted to the present edition. Where the original acts are not to be found, either the acts themselves or their titles are supplied from Trott.

The omissions of sections and parts of acts, perpetually occurring in the Collections of Trott and Grimke, are supplied as far as possible from the original manuscript acts.

In conformity to the plan of the work, submitted to the legislature, and approved by the report of the Judiciary Committee, (adopted 1835) the following classes of Acts are reserved for the concluding volume ; the titles and numbers of them only, are inserted in the present.

Acts of Supplies and Appropriations.

Acts relating to Highways, Roads, Rivers, Bridges, Canals, Rail Roads.

Acts relating to incorporated Societies.

Acts relating to the City of Charleston.

Acts relating to Militia, Cavalry, Artillery, and Volunteer Companies.

Acts relating to the coloured population of this State.

Acts for establishing Circuits and Courts of every description.

Note. — It frequently happens, that the early Acts of the Province are apparently dated with a double date, as 1714-5 : it may ho well to explain this. I copy the following from the 3d edition of Audley’s Companion to the Almanach, p. 12, 13, and from Nicholas’s Notitia Historica, 1824, p. I, 2.

“ Considerable difficulty is often felt by persons unaccustomed to Antiquarian literature, in understanding the alteration in the style; and likewise in exactly comprehending the year intended to be expressed, when written thus, 1674, 1734-5. The following short explanation is therefore submitted, in hopes of rendering the subject clear.

“ Previous to September 1752 the civil or legal year in England, commenced on the day of the Annunliation of the Virgin Mary, 25th March; while the historical year, began as at present on the day of the Circumcision, the 1st of January. Thus a confusion was created in

AN ACT for Regulating Publique Houses. No. 114.

< WHEREAS the unlimited number of Taverns, Tapp Houses, and Preamble. Punch Houses, and the want of sobriety, honesty and discretion in the owners or masters of such houses, have and will encourage all such vices as usually are the productions of drunkenness; for the prevention whereof,

Be it enacted by his Excellency, William Earl of Craven, Palatine, and the rest of the Lords and absolute Proprietors of the Province of Carolina, and with the advice and consent of the rest of the members of the General Assembly, now met at Charlestown, for the south and west part of this province, And it is enacted by the authority of the same, that Tavern no person whatsoever shall sell any Wine, Sider, Beere, Brandy, Rum, keepers to take Punch, or any strong drink whatsoever, under the quantity of one gallon, 011 'icense' at one draught, until he or they have first obtained a licence from the right honourable Joseph Blake, Landgrave and Governor, for such selling of the aforesaid liquors under the quantity aforesaid, shall forfeit for every time he shall sell any quantity less than one gallon, five pounds current silver of this province, to be levied by bill, plaint or information in any of the courts within this province, twenty shillings thereof to the prosecutor, and five pounds to the Governor aforesaid. (Thus in the original.)

And be it further enacted, That every person which hereafter doth or shall retail any of the liquors aforesaid, shall pay to the right honourable Joseph'Blake, Governor, for each licence for selling the same, for the time or term of one whole year after the date of the said licence, the sum of five pounds current money of this province for retailing of wine and

describing the year between the 1st of January and 25th of March : for Civilians call each day within that period, one year earlier than Historians. For example; the Civilians wrote January 7, 165S, while Historians who pay no attention to the 25th of March, call it January 7, 1659 : though hoth describe the following March and all the ensuing months as being included in 1659. To prevent errors, that part of each year is usually written agreeably to both calculations, by placing two figures at the end ; the upper being the civil or legal year, the lower the historical year : thus, February 3, 1G4‘- S'*'51 or Year- Hence, whenever the year is so J J 0 Historical Year. ’ J

written, (as it is in our early Acts of Assembly) the lower figure always indicates the year according to our present calendar and computation of time.

The alteration in the calendar, which formed what is usually called the old and new style, took place the 2d of September, 1752, on which day the old style ceased, and the next day became the 14th, instead of the 3d of September.

“ In Scotland the year was ordered to commence on the 1st of January, instead of the 25th of March, by Proclamation of November 27, 1599.

“ The calendar was improved in ancient times by Julius Caesar, who finding the sun performed his course in 365 days and a quarter, nearly, gave 365 days to each three years, and 366 days to the fourth year ,' by adding one day before the 6th of the Kalends of February ; and from this, twice 6th, his sextus, we have the term Bissextile or J_,eap year. But the Astronomers concerned in reforming the calendar under Pope Gregory XIII, observing that in four years the bissextile added forty-four minutes more than the real course of the sun, and that in 133 years this would cause the difference of a day, directed that in every 400 years there should be a retrenchment of three sextiles, the years expressing the centuries not being leap years, unless divisible by 4. Thus 1600 and 2000 are bissextile, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 are not. This improvement was adopted in England in 1752, in pursuance of an Act of Parliament, in which it was ordered that the day next following the 2d of September should be accounted not the 3d but the 14th of that month; the omission of the intermediate days causing the difference between the old and the new style. By the same Act of Parliament the commencement of the civil year was changed from the 25th of March to the 1st of January.

Worship in this Province according to the Church of England, and for the erecting of Churches for the Publick Worship of God, and also for the Maintenance of Ministers and the building convenient houses for them, amongst other things it is enacted that on Easter Munday, in the year one thousand seven hundred and six, the inhabitants of each parish that are qualified by the said Act to choose vestry men, shall meet at their parish church, or for want of a parish church at such place as the commissioners named in the said Act, or the major part of them that shall meet upon publick summons, shall appoint, and shall there make choice of and appoint two sober and discreet persons, inhabitants of the parish, that are of the religion of the Church of England and do conforme to the same, and that are either freeholders within the same parish or that do contribute to the publick taxes and charges thereof, to be church wardens for that year : but in the said Act there is no provision made for the yearly electing of church wardens from and after the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and six; therefore, for certain declaration and supply of the defect of the said Act in that behalfe,

He is a Bastard that is horn before the Marriage of his Parents.

TO the King’s Writ of Bastardy, Whether one beingborn before matrimony may inherit in like manner as he that is born after matrimony, all the Bishops answered. That they would not, nor could not, answer to it; because it was directly against the common Order of the Church. (2) And all the Bishops mstanted the Lords, that they would consent, that all such as were born afore matrimony should be legitimate, as well as they that be born * within matrimony, as to the succession of inheritance, for so much as the Church accepteth such for legitimate. And all the Earls and Barons with one voice answered, that they would not change the laws of the realm, which hitherto have been used and approved.

(5) And if he flee, and will not give accompt willingly, as is contained elsewhere in other statutes, he shall be distrained to come before the Justices to make his accompt, if he have whereof to be distrained.

[The Statutes of Jeofail, Misplesider and Amendment, are connected with, and illustrative of each other, and may well be inserted under the authority of Sect. 2 of the Act of Assembly of Dec. 12, 1712. They constitute a code, which has served as the basis of the liberal practice adopted in our own courts. They have tended greatly to suppress frivolous and vexatious objections, and place the decision of a cause on its merits. I have therefore supplied the Statutes which Grimke has omitted, relying on the fair and liberal construction of Sect. 2 of Act of 12th Dec. 1712.]

[4] And that this ordinance shall have relation and force, by authority aforesaid, for the executors of every testator, as well of every outlawry pronounced against any person at any time before this parliament, as of all manner of outlawries to be pronounced against any person in time to come.

A remedy for Executors against Servants that embezzle their Master's 33 H.6. c. 1. goods after his death.

FIRST, our foresaid Lord the King, considering how that of late time divers household servants, as well of Lords as of other persons of good 3 insi. 104. degree, shortly after the death of their said Lords and masters, violently (i'i. h in u=e? and riotously have taken and spoiled the goods which were of their said ^ast'

Loids and masters, at the time of their death, and the same distributed amongst them, to the impediment of the execution of the will of their said Lords and masters, and to the great displeasure of Cod, and also contrary to the duty and truth which they ought to have had towards their said Lords and masters, and to a perilous example in time to come, unless due remedy in this behalf be provided. [2] Wherefore the same Lord the King, by the advice, assent and authority aforesaid, hath ordained and established, that after full information made to the Chancellor of England for the time being, by the executors of any such Lord or person, or two of the said executors, of such riot, taking, and spoil made, or hereafter to be made, by the household servants of their or his said testator, after his death, the same chancellor, by the advice of the chief justices of the King’s bench, and of the common bench, and chief baron of the exchequer for the time being, or two of them, shall have power to make so many, and such writs, to be directed to such sheriffs by their discretion, as to them in this behalf shall seem necessary, to make open proclamation in such cities, boroughs, towns, or places, two market days within twelve days next after the delivery of the same writs, as to the same chancellor, by the advice aforesaid, shall seem reasonable; that the said offenders shall appear before the same our Lord the King, or his heirs, in his bench, at such a day as by the said writ shall be limited, so that the said last proclamation be made by fifteen days before the same day of appearance; [3] and if any such writ be returned at the day contained in the said writ, and the writ be executed that proclamation is thereupon had and made according to the said ordinance, and then if the said peison or persons, which should appear by reason of the said proclamation, make default at the day specified in the said writ, and do not appear, then he or they so making default shall be attainted of felony.

II. And if any such persons or person do appear at the same day, then the justices of the said King’s bench shall have power, by the said ordinance, to commit such person or persons so appearing, to prison, there to remain according to the said justices discretion, until the said offenders in the said bench do answer to the said executors in such actions, which the said executors will declare against them, or any of them, by bid or by writ, for the riot, taking and spoiling aforesaid, and that the same actions be determined; [2j so that the same actions be pursued with effect, and not slackly, to the intent to keep the same person or persons in prison.

III. And if such persons or person be set at liberty out of prison by the

said justices, that then the same persons or person shall find sufficient per- V Gaoler's sons to be bounden with them to the said executors, by way of recognizance ^lu‘ael^or in the said bench, by discretion of the justices, to keep such days as he or liberty a they shall have by the same court; [2] and if the keepers of the prison, prisoner whereunto the said person or persons be committed, do let them go at large hiTcufawfvhy out of the prison of his own authority, without the consideration and oiderforce ofih’is of the said justices, then the said keeper shall forfeit and loose 40 [400]8ta,ule* pounds to the said executors ; [3] and that no protection be allowed in any action to be taken upon the said ordinance.

WHERE in the Parliament begun at London the 3d day of November, in the 21st year of the late King of most famous memory, King Henry the Eighth, and after by prorogation holden at Westminster in the 25lh year of the reign of the said late King, there was one act and statute made, entitled, An Act for the Punishment of the Vice of .Buggery, whereby the said detestable vice was made felony, as in the said statute more at large it doth and may appear: (2) Forasmuch as the said statute concerning the punishment of the said crime and offence of Buggery standeth at this present repealed and void by virtue of the statute of repeal made in the 1st year of the reign of the late Queen Mary : Sithence which repeal so had and made, divers evil disposed persons have been the more bold to commit the said most horrible and detestable vice of Buggery aforesaid, to the high displeasure of Almighty God;

II. Be it enacted, That the said statute before mentioned, made in the 25th year of the said late King Henry the 8th, for the punishment of the said detestable vice of Buggery, and every branch, clause, aiticle and sentence therein contained, shall from and after the 1st day of June next coming be revived, and from thenceforth shall stand, remain, and be in full force, strength and effect for ever, in such manner, form and condition, as the same statute was at the day of the death of the said late King Henry the Eighth; the said statute of repeal made in the said 1st year of the said late Queen Mary, or any words general or special therein contained, or any other act or acts, thing or things, to the contrary notwithstanding.

An Act for the following of Hue and Cry* 27 Eliz. c. 13.

WHEREAS by 2 ancient statutes, the 1 made in the parliament holden at Winchester in the 13th year of the reign of King Edward the 1st, and Hue and cry the other in the 2Sth year of the reign of King Edward the 3d, it was, for and by the better repressing of robberies and felonies (amongst other things) mndeTand t?ie enacted to this effect, that if the country do not answer for the bodies of penalty for such malefactors, that then the pain should be such, that is to wit, 1^ere°f

that the people dwelling in the country shall be answerable for the robberies done, and the damages, [2] so that the whole hundred where the robbery shall be done, with the franchises which are. within the precinct of the same hundred, shall answer the robberies done ; [3] and if the robbery The effect of chance to be done in the division of two hundreds, that then both the hun-flutes louch-dreds together, with the franchises within the precinct of them, shall be J-J*? robbery!^ answerable, as in the said 2 several statutes it doth more at large appear.

II. Forasmuch as the said parts of the said several statutes being of late days more commonly put in execution, than heretofore they have been, are Several found by experience to be very hard and extreme to many of the Queen’s ces

majesty’s good subjects, because by the same statutes they do remain ajbTesafd 6 charged with the penalties therein contained, notwithstanding their inabil-statutes, toueh-ity to satisfy the same, and though they do as much as in reason might be ^yIIue ai‘d required in pursuing such malefactors and offenders, [2] whereby both 2 Vent. 215. large scope of negligence is given to the inhabitants and resiants in other hundreds and counties, not to prosecute the hue and cry made, followed, and brought unto them, by reason they are not chargeable for arty portion of the goods robbed, nor with any damages in that behalf given ; [3] and also great encouragement and emboldening is likewise given unto the offenders, to commit daily more felonies and robberies, as seeing it iri manner impossible for the inhabitants and resiants of the said hundred and franchises wherein the robbery is committed, to apprehend tbgin without

(The following section of an Act of 17 Charles 2, ch. 7, A.D. 1665, entitled “ An Act for a more speedy and effectual proceeding upon Distresses and Avowries for Rents,” is inserted on the authority of Solomon vs. Ilervey et. al. 1 Nott and JIcCord's Reports, 82.)

II. Forasmuch as the ordinary remedy for arrearages of rents, is by distress upon the lands chargeable therewith ; and yet nevertheless, by reason of the intricate and dilatory proceedings upon replevins, that remedy is become ineffectual : For remedy thereof, it is enacted by the

King’s most excellent majesty, with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That whensoever any plaintiff in replevin shall be nonsuit before issue joined, in any suit of replevin by plaint or writ lawfully returned, removed or depending in any of the King's courts at Westminster, that the defendant making a suggestion in nature of an avowry or cognizance of such rent, to ascertain the court of the cause of distress, the court upon his prayer shall award a writ to the sheriff of the county where the distress was taken, to inquire by the oaths of twelve good and lawful men of his bailiwick, touching the sum in ar r*ear at the time of such distress taken, and the value of the goods or cattle distrained, and thereupon notice of fifteen days shall be given to the plaintiff or his attorney in court, of the sitting of such inquiry ; and thereupon the sheriff shall inquire of the truth of the matters contained in such writ, by the oaths of twelve good and lawful men of his county: And upon the return of such inquisition, the defendant shall have judgement to recover against the plaintiff the arrearages of such rent, in case the goods or cattle distrained shall amount unto that value; and in case they shall not amount up to that value, then so much as the value of the said goods and cattle so distrained shall amount unto, together with his full costs of suit; and shall have execution thereupon by fieri facias, or elegit, or otherwise, as the law shall require. And in case such plaintiff shall be nonsuit after such cognizance or avowry made, and issue joined, or if the verdict shall be given against such plaintiff, then the jurors that are impannelled or returned to enquire of such issue, shall at the prayer of the defendant inquire concerning the sum of the arrears, and the value of the goods or cattle distrained ; And thereupon the avowant or he that makes cognizance, shall have judgement for such arrearages, or so much thereof, as the goods or cattle distrained amount unto, together with his full costs, and shall have execution for the same, by fieri facias or elegit, or otherwise, as the law shall require.

XII. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That an Act made in the thirtieth year of the reign of King Charles the Second, entitled, An Act to enable Creditors to recover their Debts of the Executors and Administrators of Executors in their own Wrong: which said Act, in the first year of the reign of the late King James the Second, was enacted to be in force from the first day of the then

present session of parliament, and to continue for seven years, and from thence to the end of the first session of the then next parliament, shall be and is hereby continued and made perpetual. And forasmuch as it hath been a doubt whether-the said Act did extend to any executor or agamsf^Kxecii-executors, administrator or administrators, of any executor or adminis- tors by right, trator of right, who for want of privity in law were not before answerable, nor could be sued for the debts due from or by the first testator or intestate, notwithstanding that such executors or administrators had wasted the goods and estate of the first testator or intestate, or converted the same to his or their own use : For remedy whereof be it enacted, That all and every the executor and executors, administrator or administrators, of such executor or administrator of right, who shall waste or convert to his own use, goods, chatties, or estate of his testator or intestate, shall from henceforth be liable and chargeable in the same manner as his or their testator or intestate should or might have been ; any law or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.

XIII. And whereas, by an Act made at the last session of this present Parliament, intitled, An Act to take away clergy from such offenders, and 4& 5 W. & M. to bring others to punishment, it was enacted, in cases where a man being\y^jjen oniytrf convicted of felony might demand the benefit of his clergy, a woman con-have benefit of victed for such like offence and praying the benefit of that statute, should <4m-pr ojice. not have judgment of death given against her upon such conviction, or by6&7 W. & execution awarded upon any outlawry for such offence, but should suffer c. J4. § 1. the same punishment as a man who hath the benefit of his clergy in the like case should suffer : And whereas some doubt hath arisen upon the

said statute, whether a woman should have the benefit thereof more than once ; Be it therefore declared and enacted by the authority aforesaid,

That if any woman hath been, or at any time hereafter shall be, convicted of any felony, for which a mau might have the benefit of clergy, and upon her prayer hath once had or hereafter shall once have, the benefit of the said statute, and shall be again convicted of any other felony, for which a man might have the benefit of his clergy, such woman shall be, and is hereby totally excluded from having any benefit or advantage of the said statute, but shall suffer pains of death in such and the same manner as if the said statute had not been made. And be it further enacted, That the said last mentioned Act shall continue and be in force for the space of three years, from the thirteenth day of February, one thousand six hundred ninety-two, and from thence to the end of the next session of Parliament,• and no longer.

II. And from and after the said first day of May, every person or per-^ac'tiolfof1es-sons obtaining judgment in any action of escape against the said Marshal cape, marshal or Warden, or their respective lawful deputy or deputies, shall and may or wardens fees have not only the several remedies already by law allowed for obtaining ed for'saiisfoc-" satisfaction thereon, but the judges of the respective comts where such

judgment shall be obtained (upon oath before them made by the person or persons obtaining such judgment, that the same was obtained without fraud or covin, and that the debt of the prisoner making such escape was a true and real debt and unsatisfied) shall upon motion made to them in open court for that purpose, sequester the fees and profits of the office of Marshal or Warden, or so much, or such part or proportion thereof, as the said court wherein such motion shall he made shall think fit and reasonable, with respect to the debt or debts due from such prisoner or prisoners so escaping, and in the first place apply the same towards satisfaction of the debt or debts due from the prisoner or prisoners who escaped, together with all costs and damages recovered in such action of escape.

III. And to the end that such satisfaction may not be deferred by any writ of error brought for delay only, be it enacted, That if the said Mar-

An Act for ascertaining the rates of Foreign Coins in her Majestfs A.D. 1707-Plantations in America. Ann

WHEREAS, for remedying the inconveniences which had arisen from the different rates at which the same species of foreign silver coins did pass in her Majesty’s several colonies and plantations in America, her most excellent Majesty has thought fit, by her royal proclamation, bearing date the eighteenth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and four, and in the third year of her reign, to settle and ascertain the currency of foreign coins in her said colonies and plantations, in the manner and words following :

We having had under our consideration the different rates at which the same species of foreign coins do pass in our several colonies and planta- Proclamation tioris in America, and the inconveniences thereof, by the indirect practice for ascertaining of drawing the money fiom one plantation to another, to the great preju- fo^dgnedns in' dice of the trade of our subjects; and being sensible that the same cannot America, be otherwise remedied, than by reducing of all foreign coins to the same current rate within all our dominions in America; and the principal officers of our mint having laid before us a table of the value of the several foreign coins which usually pass in payments in our said plantations, according to their weight, and the assays made of them in our mint, thereby shewing the just proportion which each coin ought to have to the other, which is as followeth, viz. Sevil pieces of eight, old plate, seventeen penny weight twelve grains, four shillings and six pence; Sevil pieces of eight, new plate, fourteen penny weight, three shillings, seven pence, one farthing; Mexico pieces of eight, seventeen penny weight twelve grains, four shillings and six pence ; Pillar pieces of eight, seventeen penny weight twelve grains, four shillings and six pence three farthings ; Peru pieces of eight, old plate, seventeen penny weight twelve grains, four shillings and five pence, or thereabouts ; cross dollars, eighteen penny weight, four shillings and four pence three farthings; ducatoons of Flan-

II. And whereas, notwithstanding the said proclamation, the same indirect practices as are therein mentioned, are still carried on within some of the said colonies or plantations, and the money thereby drawn from one plantation to another, in prejudice of the trade of her Majesty’s subjects; wherefore, for the better inforcing the due execution of her Majesty’s said proclamation throughout all the said colonies and plantations, and for the more effectual remedying the said inconveniencies thereby intended to be remedied, be it enacted by the Queen's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That if any person within any of the said colonies ot plantations, as well those under proprietors or charters, as under her Majesty’s immediate commission and government, shall after the first day of May, which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and nine, for the discharge of any contracts or bargains to be thereafter made, account, receive, take, or pay any of the several species of foreign silver coins mentioned in the before recited proclamation, at any greater or higher rate than at which the same is thereby regulated, settled, and allowed, to be accounted, received, taken or paid, every such person so accounting, receiving, taking, or paying the same, contrary to the directions therein contained, shall suffer six months imprisonment, without bail or main-prize ; any law, custom or usage in any of the said colonies or plantations to the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding ; and shall likewise forfeit the sum of ten pounds for every such offence; one moiety thereof

X And whereas great difficulties and inconveniencies frequently arise to landlords and lessors and other persons taking distresses for rent, in removing the goods and chattels or stock distrained, off the premises, in cases where by law they may not be impounded and secured thereupon; and also to the tenants themselves many times, by the damage unavoidably done to such goods and chattels, or stock, in the removal thereof; be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight, it shall Distresses may and may be lawful to and for any person or persons lawfully taking ar,y golden the distress for any kind of rent, to impound, or otherwise to secure the dis-mjsse8- pre tress so made of what nature or kind soever it may be, in such place, or on such part of the premisses chargeable with the rent, as shall be most fit and convenient for the impounding and securing such distress; and to appraise, sell, and dispose of the same upon the premisses, in like manner, and under the like directions and restraints to all intents and purposes, as any person taking a distress for rent may now do off the premisses, by virtue of an act made in the second year of the reign of King 2 c-

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall and maybe lawful for the court where such ejectment shall be brought, to suffer the landlord or landlords to make him, her, or themselves defendant or defendants, by joining with the tenant or tenants, to whom such declaration in ejectment shall be delivered, in case he or they shall appear ; but in case such tenant or tenants shall refuse or neglect to appear, judgment shall be signed against the casual ejector for want of such appearance ; but if the landlord or landlords of any jiart of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, for which such ejectment was brought, shall desire to appear by himself or themselves, and consent to enter into the like rule, that by the course of the court the tenant in possession in case he or she had appeared ought to have done; then the court where such ejectment'shall be brought shall and may permit such landlord or landlords so to do, and order a stay of execution upon such judgment against the casual ejector, until they shall make further order therein.

XIV. And to obviate some difficulties that many times occur in the recovery of rents, where the demises are not by deed, be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twenty-fourth day of June it shall and may be lawful to and for the landlord or landlords, where the agreement is not by deed, to recover a reasonable satisfaction for the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, held or occupied by the defendant or defendants, in an action on the case, for the use and occupation of what -was so held or enjoyed ; and if in evidence on the trial of such action any parol demise or any agreement (not being by deed,) whereon a certain

l ent was reserved, shall appear, the plaintiff in such action shall not therefore be nonsuited, but may make use thereof as an evidence of the Quantum of the damages to be recovered.

XV. And whereas where any lessor or landlord, having only an estate for life in the lands, tenements, or hereditaments demised,happens to die before or on the day, on which any rent is reserved, or made payable, such rent, or any part thereof, is not by law recoverable by the executors or administrators of such lessor or landlord ;'nor is the person in reversion entitled thereto, any other than for the use and occupation of such lands, tenements, or hereditaments, from the death of the tenant for life ; of which advantage hath been often taken by the under-tenants, who thereby avoid paying any

XVI. And whereas landlords are often great sufferers by tenants running away in arrear, and not only suffering the demised premises to lie *°r

uncultivated, without anydisttess thereon, whereby their landlords or les-where tenant* sors might be satisfied for the rent-arrear, but also refusing to deliver up desert the the possession of the demised premises, whereby the landlords are put topremisses-the expence and delay of recovering in ejectment; be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight, if any tenant holding any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, at a rack-rent, or where the rent reserved shall be full three-fourths of the yearly value of the demised premisses, who shall be in arreai for one year’6 rent, shall desert the demised premisses, and leave the same uncultivated or unoccupied, so as no sufficient distress can be had to countervail the arrears of lent; it shall and may be lawful to and for two or more justices of the peace of the county, riding, division, or place (having no interest in the demised premisses) at the request of the lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, or his, her, or their bailiff or receiver, to go upon and view the same, and to affix, or cause to be affixed, on the most notorious part of the premisses, notice in writing, what day (at the distance of fourteen days at least) they will return to take a second view thereof; and if upon such second view, the tenant, or some person on his or her behalf, shall not appear and pay the rent in ariear, or there shall not be sufficient distress' upon the premisses, then the said justices may put the landlord or landloi ds, lessor or lessors, into the possession of the said demised premises; and the lease thereof to such tenant, as to any demise therein contained only, shall from thenceforth become void.

said proposals are of great advantage, as well to the publick, by preventing the present charge and expence of building a new Look-out and keeping the same in constant repair and good order and fixing the buoys as aforesaid, as also to the master of every ship or vessel, by reducing two thirds of the charges before appointed to be paid towards building and repairing the Look-out and buoys, by every ship or vessel bound into this harbour:

I. Be it therefore enacted by the most noble Prince Henry Duke of Beaufort, Palatine, and the rest of the true and absolute Lords and Proprietors of this Province, by and with the advice and consent of the rest of the members of the General Assembly, now met at Charlestown for the south-west part of this Province, and by the authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful for Colonel William Rhett, and he is hereby permitted and impowered, at his sole charge and labour, to raise and erect or cause to be raised and erected, on such part of Sullivanes Island as he shall think most fit and convenient, a Look-out, not less in height than sixty feet, and composed and made of such stuff and materials, and in such figure, manner and form, as the said William Rhett shall think will most effectually answer the true intent and design of such a publick Look-out, and the same Look-out so raised and erected as aforesaid, shall at the same cost, and from time to time, and as often as there is occasion, renew, amend, and keep in good order and repair.

II. And whereas the entrance into the harbour and channel of Ashley river is so difficult to find that it often happens that ships and vessels belonging to strangers are often obliged to stand out again to sea, when it happens that the pilots, through bad weather, cannot go out to them, to the great hazard and disappointment of such ships or vessels, when if the channel was buoyed there would be less danger in standing into the harbour than standing out to sea again ; Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful for Colonel William Rhett aforesaid, and he is hereby permitted and impowered, at his sole cost and lahour aforesaid, to fix or cause to be fixed, so many buoys, with good anchors and chains or other moorings, in the channel of Ashley river and such other places thereabouts, in such manner and form as he shall think most convenient, to make the entrance of any ship or vessel into the harbour and channels easy and visible to strangers ; and that there be not less than two buoys fixed in the north channel and three in the south channel; and shall from time to time, and as often as need requires, at his own like charge and labour, support, maintain, renew, and keep in constant and good repair, the several buoys so fixed by him as aforesaid.

III. And whereas it is highly reasonable, and the practice of other sea-Twn pence per ports and maritime places, that the persons who reap the benefit of such

Look-outs and other sea-marks and buoys, should pay some acknowledgement to defray not only the first charges thereof, but also the keeping the same in order and good repair; Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the raising the said Look-out and buoying the channel, every ship or vessel bound into this harbour, shall for every

REMARKS CONCERNING THE NOTES.

The Editor wishes to observe, that the farther ho sees into the present state of the Statute Law of South Carolina, the more imperious seems the demand for a publication in which nothing of a public nature shall be omitted of past or of present legislation. Every year adds to the complication of our Law on subjects of great public interest, in which a more laborious research than can in every case be practically exacted, is absolutely necessary to accurate legislation in future. The Editor, therefore, in the notes, has added lo each Act, not only a reference to the scattered legislation on the same subject among our statutory' enactments, but to the series of judicial decisions thereon in our own State ; that this wrork may facilitate future labour, and serve as a platform, whereon lo base any future alterat-lon, amendment, improvement, or condensation of our Laws, with all the lights and aids before us that the sources of our o.-vn State can supply. This will add considerably to the labour of the Editor, but it is labour that in his opinion is demanded by the present state of our Law, and will become more difficult the longer it is deferred. The Editor submits the present brief collection of notes and references, as additions to the work, manifestly useful, if not considered as absolutely necessary.

A compilation that shall include as a Digest, a full though brief statement of all the points decided in our courts, would be a very useful book of consultation, but would not compensate a private publisher. The Editor proposed to himself such a digest in the notes to this edition; but on taking up, by' way of experiment, the cases relating to Executors and Administrators, he found them so numerous and extensive, as to. preclude hint from pursuing that plan in relation to other subjects of legislative enactment and legal decision. He has therefore, how'ever reluctantly, been compelled to refer only to the names of cases and the reporters.

CONTAINING REFERENCES TO ACTS OF ASSEMBLY AND CASES DECIDED IN THE COURTS OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

No. 111. An Act for making sufficient Fences, and keeping the same in repair; p. 81. See Act of 1827 on this subject, and 2 Bail. Rep. 389, Gibson v. Vaughan.

No. 126. An Act to prevent the stealing and taking away of Boats and Canoes; p. 105. See Act of March 11, 1754, to prevent the stealing of Negroes, Schooners and Periaugas.

As to the method of notation, viz : 1695-6, observe, that the civil year of England commences March 25th. The historical year commences January 1st. Hence March 16th, the date of this Act, is in the civil year 1695, which closes on the 24th of March, and it is in the historical year 1696, which began January 1st. The double mark of the year, therefore, appertains only to the days between January 1st and March 25.

No. 136. An Act to prevent Mariners and Seamen running in debt; p. 118.

For other Acts relating to Mariners and Seamen, see Act of 1703, No. 217, p. 229; also, section 23 of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries as to Seamen’s wills ; also, sections 12 and 13 of the poor Act of 1712; also, section of 1 Ann, Statute 2, ch. 9, A.D. 1701 ; also, Act of Assembly 17th May, 1751, relating to Seamen; also, section 2 of Act of Assembly, 13th April, 1756; also, section 6 of Act of Assembly, 26th March, 1784 ; also, Act of Assembly relating to Wills, March 13th, 1789; also, the Statute of 25 George 2, ch. 6, A.D. 1729, made of force in the Provinces and Colonies.

The mischief provided against in this Act, is the stellionate of the civil law, 1 Domat 244 ; whereby, if the thing sold or mortgaged a second time, was insufficient in value to satisfy both demands, the latter contract is annulled, and the party selling or mortgaging, punished.

This Act is the commencement of our system of registering and recording.

No. 203. An Act for the more effectual suppressing of Blasphemy and Profaneness., 1703, p. 19G. This Act is copied from the English Statute of 9 and 10 William the 3rd, cli. 32, 1698, which is now repealed in that country. I apprehend this Act is also virtually repealed by the 8th article of our Constitution, 1790. Laws should be enacted against improper conduct, which can not against improper opinions, which cannot be controlled by legislation-, and which are liable to change with every changing generation of men, and must necessarily be the result of such evidence as may happen to be offered to the understanding.

Also, the clause concerning the return of Executions, in the supplementary Act of 17th December, 1803. Also, the Acts of Assembly for 1821, 1825, 1829, on the duties of Coroner.

No. 256. An Act for the establishment of Religious Worship, 1706, p. 282. The 27th section of this Act, relating to marriage by Laymen, has been decided to be obsolete, by Watson v. Blaylocke, 2 Mill’s Constit. Rep. 351.

The clauses against marriage within the prohibited degrees, and those which relate to the divisions of parishes, are in force : except where parish boundaries have been since modified by later Acts, which will be noticed in their proper places. As to parishes, see the next Act of Assembly after this, viz: December 18, 1708. A reference to Acts concerning particular parishes will be found in the Index to the Acts of Assembly published by Faust, from 1791 to 1804. The Acts themselves are inserted in this collection.

For other Acts relating to the subject of religious worship, see Act No. 1, A.D. 1682, No. 289, A.D. 1710, No. 307, A.D. 1712, No. 320, A.D. 1712, adopted in the Charleston City Acts; and the Act of December 17, 1794, for the incorporating certain religious societies. A verdict on a Sunday, not being dies jurisdicus, is void, per Shaw v. M’Combs, 2 Bay, 232.

It seems at this day to be the prevailing and reasonable opinion, that when men meet together to form themselves into a political community, they contemplate their mutual duties founded upon their connection and relation here, in this world, not in the world to come. For all the laws of morality arise from and are founded upon the duties of man towards man in a state of society. The affairs of the next world, are matters of private belief, not of public cognizance ; and the business of society can go on without reference to any religious creed whatever. This principle seems to have suggested the 8th article of our Constitution, which enacts that “the free exercise of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever after be allowed in this State to all mankind.” Constitutional law is the paramount law of the land, and every legislative Act contravening it, is ipso facto void.

This does not interfere with the right of the legislature to incorporate religious societies for civil purposes. Nor with the right of appointing a Sabbath or day of rest from labour, as a municipal institution, conducive to civil expedience. But a Sabbath appointed as a day of religious observance, and sanctioning any religious creed on the subject, I apprehend is not justifiable under our Constitution, which does not authorize any such discrimination or preference.

Ok Coin, Currency, Paper Money, Depreciation.

Coin. — A dollar, a. peso, peso duro, piece of eight (eight reals) all mean what we now commonly call a dollar. Frequently also, a dollar was called piastre. Very early, that is before 1700, the dollars were distinguished for weight and fineness. The Mexican pillar dollar, the Globe dollar, the Seville dollar, weighing 13 pennyweights or 312 grains troy weight, were by Act of 11th December, 1691, p. 72 of the present volume, allowed to pass for five shillings, and the half dollar for two shillings and sixpence. All other dollars that weighed from 10 to 13 pennyweights, were allowed to pass for shillings only.

The real or riall (called in one of our early Acts the royal*) was at that time the eighth part of a dollar, or our present 12£ cent piece. At present the real is the 20th part of a dollar; and of reals there are eight varieties of different value : see 1 Kelly’s Cambist, p. 316 to 319.

The Act of January 14, 1692-3, on the value of coins, is not now extant.

By Act of 17th January, 1694-5, pieces of eight of Mexico pillars, Peru lion dollars, Seville and other silver coins containing full 13 pennyweights (312 troy grains) shall pass for five shillings, and the half dollar of six and a half pennyweights, for two shillings and sixpence. And silver coin weighing from ten to 13 pennyweights shall pass for four shillings only. Hence gold in this Colony was to silver in value only at that time as 13 to 1. For pieces of gold were ordered to pass for ten shillings for two pennyweights or 48 grains.

The Proclamation Act of 6 Ann, 1707, I shall notice presently.

By an Act to ascertain the weight and value of the several gold and silver coins in circulation, 12th March, 1783, a table of weights and values of several sorts of coin is constructed, in which the weight of the Spanish dollar is omitted, but its value is fixed at shillings 8d. The value of gold may be collected from that table; thus, a Spanish doubloon of 17 pennyweights (408 grains) is c£3 10, or twenty pence half penny for ten grains. The value of standard silver money in England from the year 1600 to the end of George 3, has been 5s. 2d. per ounce troy. The value of fine silver 5s. Id. The gold standard being to the silver standard in value, as 15 to 1. By this Act all payments are to be made according to the valuation of coin or currency at the date of the contract.

‘•In Carolina (says Dr. Ramsay in his History of South Carolina, v. 1, p. 163) as a British Province, sterling was the legal money of the country : but unfortunately there was very little of it in the Province, or in any of the British Colonies. The greatest part of their current gold and silver was foreign coin. The local Assemblies settled the value thereof by laws peculiar to each Province. To remedy the inconveniences arising from the different rates of foreign coin in the several Colonies, an Act of Parliament was passed and a proclamation founded thereon by Queen Ann in 1708, for ascertaining the current rate of foreign coin in all the Colonies. This fixed their nominal current value in British America, at one fourth above the nominal value in sterling money. But

. * But in the reign of the English Kings from lien. 6 to Charles 1, there appears to have been a coin called a Royal, whose value varied at different times, from ten to thirty shillings. See Rees’ Encyc. — Money.

the demand for more circulating medium in a new country than could be furnished in coin, was so urgent, that this regulation was not regarded, and the confusion arising from the different values of British sterling and provincial current paper money, became general throughout the Colonies. In some, a dollar passed for six shillings, in others for seven and sixpence, in North Carolina and New York for eight shillings, in South Carolina for one pound twelve shillings and sixpence. In the latter, the comparative value of sterling coin and paper money diverged so far from each other, that after passing through all the intermediate grades of depreciation, it was finally fixed at seven pounds of the paper bills for one pound sterling. It afterwards assumed the character of currency as distinct from sterling, and formed, as it were, another denomination and species of money.”

Thus far Ramsay, whose whole section on the fiscal history of this State, in his second volume, should be carefully consulted. I can find no lights on this question of the variable value of coined money in Hewitt’s account of South Carolina and Georgia.

Judge Brevard, in his introduction, p. xii, speaks as follows:

“Proclamation money, which is also frequently mentioned in our Acts of Assembly, acquired that denomination from a proclamation of Queen Ann in the sixth year of her reign, about the year 1708; the object of which was, to establish a common measure of value for the paper currencies of the Colonies. The same species of coins which were equally rated in all the Colonies and passed at the same value as sterling money, were variously rated and of different values in relation to the paper currency of the different Colonies. In some of them the dollar passed at 8s. — 7s.6<L and 6s., according to the quantities of paper thrown into circulation. The standard fixed by the proclamation, was, one hundred and thirty three pounds six shillings and eight pence (133,6. 8.) paper currency, for one hundred pounds sterling. The nominal value of currency was established at one fourth below the value of sterling. The dollar passed at six shillings and three pence, although not quite equal to six shillings and two pence three farthings proclamation money.

“This regulation, though it was respected by the Colonial Legislatures, was little attended to by the people at large; and the confusion resulting from paper currencies of different values continued to exist.” (Brevard vt. sup.)

The Act in question is 6 Ann, ch. 30, Anno 1707 (not 1708) of the common editions of the Statutes at Large, and 6 Ann, ch. 57, 58, of the Statutes of the Realm. Although enacted expressly for the Colonies and binding upon them legally, it is not to be found in the enumeration of British Acts by Trott, or the collection of Grimke.

The Proclamation and Act will be found in its chronological place among the British Statutes in the present edition. By this proclamation, the following values were set upon coins under the authority of their respective weights and the assays of them made at the Mint at London.

Seville pieces of eight, old plate, weighing 17 pennyweights 12 grains (or 420 grains) four shillings and six pence.

Seville pieces of eight, new plate, 14 pennyweights (336 grains) three shillings and seven pence one farthing.

Mexico pieces of eight, 17 pennyweights 12 grains, four shillings and 6 pence.

Pillar pieces of eight, 17 pennyweights 12 grains, four shillings and six pence three farthings.

Peru pieces of eight, old plate, 17 pennyweights 12 grains, four shillings and five pence, or thereabouts.

Cross dollars, 18 pennyweights (432 grains) four shillings and four pence three farthings.

As by an Act of lltli December, 1691, of the South Carolina Assembly, the current weights of the Mexican, the Pillar, and the Seville dollars, were taken at 312 grains, while the same coins in 1716 weighed 420 grains, it is probable that all the foreign dollars current in early times in South Carolina, were filed and sweated before they were permitted to go into circulation.

By Act of March 12, 1783, the Spanish milled dollar is 4s. 8d. The dollar was afterwards reckoned at the exaggerated value of <£l 12 6; but that was in the depreciated current money, which passed at seven for one. See Act of Assembly, March 16, 1783, giving the then scale of depreciation.

On the subject of Coin, I can find no other facts on record, till the Act of Congress relating to the Mint, of April 2, 1792, directing a coinage of eagles, value ten dollars, containing 247-j grains of pure gold and 22^ grains of alloy, the standard weight being 270 grains ; half eagles and quarter eagles, in proportion. This makes pure gold worth 97 cents per pennyweight of 24 grains, and standard gold about 89 cents per pennyweight. Dollars to contain 371^ grains of pure silver, and 416 grains of standard silver. Hence, 247^ grains of pure gold, are supposed to be worth ten times as much as 371^ grains of pure silver; and 270 grains of standard gold, worth ten times as much as 416 grains of standard silver. This brings the proportional value of pure gold to silver as 15 to 1; according to the eleventh section of that Act.

By a report of a committee of the Senate, 1830, of which General Samuel Smith of Baltimore was chairman, it appears that our current silver dollar, which at par of exchange was usually reckoned at As.Qd. sterling, having been weighed and assayed at the Mint at London, was found to be worth 49§ pence sterling only. Were it worth 50 pence, then would one cent be exactly one half-penny sterling ; and the pound sterling would be worth four dollars and eighty cents, instead of $4 44, as heretofore calculated. A11 Act of Congress w-as passed in 1831, adopting this convenient alteration.

By chapter 95 of Acts of Congress of 1834, an alteration was made in the coinage of the United States, of somew hat dubious propriety. The eagle is to contain 232 only instead of 247^ grains of pure gold, and 258 instead of 270 grains of standard gold. The eagle is to be counted as before, equivalent to ten

dollars. Gold coins, coined anterior to the first of July, 1834, are made receivable in all payments at 94,8 cents per pennyweight (of 24 grains.) This Act alters the proportional value of gold to silver, from 15 to 1, to 16 to 1. Fifteen to one was too low ; I think the nearest approximation to the real proportion would have been 15.75 to 1.

By chapter 96 of the Acts of the same session, the gold coins of Great BritainT Portugal and Brazil, not less than twenty-two carats fine, (that is, containing two parts of alloy in twenty-four parts,) shall pass at the rate of 94.8 cents per pennyweight of 24 grains, troy. The gold coins of France 9.10 fine, at 93.1 cents per pennyweight. The gold coins of Spain, Mexico, and Columbia, of 20 carats, 3 grains and one sixteenth of a grain fine, at 89.9 cents per pennyweight.

Such are the facts that have met my research as to Specie Money or Coin.

From Brevard's Introduction to his Digest, p. xi.

“ In 1702, in order to pay the expenses occasioned by an unfortunate military expedition against St. Augustine, the Legislature authorized the issue of stamped Bills of Credit, to be sunk in three years by a duty on liquors, skins and furs. This was the first paper money that appeared in the Province, and was the origin of current money, mentioned in many of our Acts of Assembly, and of what was called old currency till the close of the revolution. It was denominated current money, to distinguish it from sterling money of England, very little of which was ever in circulation, the balance of trade being always in favor of the mother country.

“ The credit of this currency was at first equal to sterling, and so continued for about six .years, but afterwards depreciated. The necessities of the government continually requiring fresh supplies of a medium of value for circulation, to defray the charges incurred by Indian and Spanish wars, and other exigencies of a feeble and harassed Colony, succeeding emissions of bills of credit took place. The first emissions were 4000 and 8000 pounds; but in 1712, a publick Bank was established, and the issue of bills amounted to <£48,000, which were called Bank Bills, and like our present bank money might be loaned out on security. This paper currency might be legally tendered in payment of debts, though the bills did not carry interest, and were payable at a future time. Expedients were devised for the purpose of reducing the quantity in circulation, which became at length excessive, notwithstanding the emissions were restrained by royal instructions. These expedients were frustrated by new emissions. Thirty thousand pounds issued in 1716, and <£210,000 in 1736.

“Yet under all these disadvantages little or no depreciation took place after the first five or six years of the first emission, for the space of forty years and upwards. The depreciation, which had soon settled at 7 for 1, remained fixed at that point with little or no variation till the year 1750 ; and even after that period it continued to be the nominal measure of exchange. The Spanish milled dollar, that passed current at 4s. 8d. sterling money, was equal to <£l. 12s. 8d. current money. By this relative measure of value, the amount of fines and forfeitures imposed by various Acts of Assembly may be correctly estimated.

“ The credit of paper currency was now much degraded, and an Act of February 6, 1782, gave the final blow to it, by taking from it its quality as a legal tender in discharge of debts.”

To the above quotation from Brevard, the Editor meant to have added some extracts from Dr. Ramsay’s fiscal history of South Caroiina in the second volume of his History, illustrating the rise and progress in this Province, of Paper Credit, Paper Money, and its Depreciation; but as Dr. Ramsay’s book is, and is likely to remain, a work always called for by the public, it may suffice to refer to Yol. 2, p. 163, to the end of that section. To this the reader will do well to add in his consultations, the Act of March 16, 1783, furnishing a scale of depreciation from 1777 to 1780 inclusive.

NOTES.

Interest of Money. — The Editor can find no earl) Act of Assembly settling what shall be the legal interest of money. Very early, from 1700 to 1706, persons paying their taxes in advance were allowed 12 per cent, interest thereon. The following extract from Dr. Ramsay’s History, vol. 2, p. 197, will give a summary.of the known facts on this subject:

“A few observations on the rate of Interest and Usury, as connected with the fiscal history of South Carolina, shall close this chapter. For the first fifty years after the settlement there is no evidence of any law fixing the rate of interest, nor of any against usury. Two laws were passed, one in 1720, the other in 1721, against usury : the last of which indirectly brings into view the rate of interest. [See No. 414, and the Act of Sept. 15, 1721.] This prohibits the taking of more interest for money lent than ten per cent, per annum, under a forfeiture of treble the amount. When Carolina was settled, interest in England was six per cent: when this law was passed, it was five. How it came to be ten per cent. iu'Carolina, without any express law, does not appear. Perhaps common consent and usage had fixed that rate, for no evidence exists that there was one written law authorizing it. As a reason for proscribing usury, it is stated ih the law of 1721, [See law of Feb. 1719, No. 417,] that ‘divers persons have of late taken advantage of the necessities of the people, and exacted twenty-five pouncte interest for the loan of one hundred pounds for one year, and very often more.’ Twenty-seven years after, in 1748, a law passed for reducing interest from 10 to 8 per cent; and twenty-nine years afterwards, in 1777, it was reduced from 8 to 7 per cent. These reductions were both preceded by plentiful emissions of paper money. With the last laws for reducing interest, severe penalties against usury were incorporated.”

At the present time, the legal interest of South Carolina is 7 per cent., as it has been since 1777. The Bank interest is 6 per cent. The public notions on the subject of usury, have been totally changed by Jeremy Bentham’s brief treatise on that subject; and in a few years it is to be hoped that legislatures will cease somewhat from their mischievous propensity of governing too much ; and leaving men who have arrived at the age of discretion, to make their own contracts as circumstances dictate the convenient terms of the mutual bargain, — use pains and penalties not to annul, but to compel the performance of voluntary contracts, deliberately made, in good faith, and with a full view of the whole ground by the parties who make them.

Since writing the above note, Mr. Carroll has republished in his Historical Collections of South Carolina, a pamphlet entitled, A Description of South Carolina; London, 1761, from which I make the following extract:

“ Paper Currency. — During the former part of Queen Anne’s War, the inhabitants of South Carolina exerted themselves very much in defence of that Colony, not only by fortifying Charles-Town, and building a fort to command the entrance of Ashley river, but by undertaking several expeditions against the Spaniards and Indians in Florida, Sec. the charges of all which fortifications and expeditions, brought the South Carolina people so much in debt, that their Assembly finding it was in vain to struggle with difficulty, by raising annual taxes, which could not have been levied soon enough to answer the present exigency, they came to the determination to strike Bills of Credit; at first, for about six thousand pounds, and having had experience of them, they afterwards issued more, to the amount of ten thousand pounds.

“ By the laws which established those bills of credit, their currency was secured; to proffer any payment with them was a tender in law, so that, if the creditor refused to take them, he lost his money, and the debtor was discharged from the minute of such refusal; but they had not any instance of that kind, the funds upon which those bills were charged being so good, that they passed in all payments without any demur or dissatisfaction. The first issued of those, bills had an interest of twelve per cent, per annum annexed to them; but upon

making the second parcel of them, the Assembly was sensible of the great inconvenience of this method. For it not only made the currency of them more difficult, by reason of the endorsements, and computing the times they had been in the Treasury, but gave the Treasurer an opportunity of injuring the public, by giving credit for that time he thought lit, as often as they came into his hands. Besides, the interest gave encouragement to people to hoard them, which was a common prejudice, by keeping so great a part of the cash [paper money] from circulating in trade; and lastly, this devouring rate of interest was such a constant addition to the public debt, that, if continued, it would have made it impossible to sink, (pay) the bills in any reasonable time, unless by burthensome taxes.

“ For these several reasons, the Assembly' enacted, that from that time forward, the Bills of Credit should run to all intents and purposes, as they had done, but without bearing any interest at all; and the people quickly found the benefit of it; for this both eased the public of a great burthen, and made the bills circulate more in trade, and with less difficulty among the common people. The Assembly indeed, by this Act, exposed themselves to the censure of those who little regarded the public so long as their own private interest was advanced; but they wisely considered that saving the public two thousand pounds a year was more to be regarded than gratifying the unreasonable avarice of some particular persons, and such is the opinion of their integrity, as well as of the ability of the Colony, that those bills never had yet circulated for less value than they were issued.

“ Current Coins. — Besides those Bills of Credit, or paper currency, there are various sorts of gold and silver coins circulating in South Carolina; the most common of tho^e coins are French pistoles, Spanish and Arabian gold, all of which passed at six shillings and three pence the penny weight, and three pence every odd grain, before the currency of money in English Colonies was regulated by an English law ; and before that regulation took place, the several sorts o( silver coin current in South Carolina were received and paid at the following rates, viz : — Dutch and German dollars, and Peruvian pieces of eight, passed at five shillings each; Mexican pieces of eight, weighing twelve pennyweight, went at the same rate, and for every pennyweight above twelve to seventeen, that those last pieces weighed, three pence half-penny more was allowed: other pieces of Spanish silver money, commonly called Ryals and half Ryals were current, the former at seven pence halfpenny, and the latter at three pence halfpenny. There was not much English money among them, but what they had, passed [Anno 1710] at fifty per cent, advance : that is a crown at seven shillings and sixpence, a guinea at thirty-two shillings three pence, and so in proportion. Conformable to those rates of currency of English coins, the course or rate of exchange between South Carolina and England in the year 1710, was <€150, South Carolina currency, for <€100 sterling.” ,

This salutary collection of Statutes, seems to confer on the courts full discretionary power to amend defects and mistakes in the pleadings and record of a cause, on such terms as may best promote the furtherance of justice, and a decision on the merits. In Pennsylvania, I have thought the Act went too far, in giving leave to amend after jury sworn ; but I may be wrong. These Acts are doubtless entitled to a liberal construction.

See Act of William 3, ch.' 3, 1695, and the note thereto. The treason Acts of England, are owing to the personal contests for the crown, in which the people — the subjects, are considered as the property of the Monarch; and the slavish doctrine of allegiance laid down by Sir Ed. Cocke in Calvin’s case, makes it due not to the nation, but to the King in his personal capacity. I apprehend the treason Acts of England lost all their force here, after the adoption of our republican Constitution.

Act enabling Judges and Justices of Peace to give restitution in cases of Forcible Entry and Detainer. 21 Jac. 1, ch. 15, 1623. p. 442 io 446.

The other Acts relating to this subject commence at p. 442. They are, 5 Rich. 2, st. 1, ch. 8, 1381. See 23d section of the Jury Act, Aug. 20, 1731. 15 Rich. 2, ch. 2, explained by 8 Hen. 6, ch. 9. Of these, the former is not made expressly of force by our Act of Assembly of 12th Dec. 1712, but the second is. I agree with Judge Brevard (title Forcible Entry) that as the former act defines the offence and is substantially referred to by the latter, it is in fact adopted among us, under the fair construction of section 2 of the Act of 1712. I have therefore inserted it at page 442.

Cases on forcible entry. The State v. Gilbert, 2 Bay, 353. The State v. Burt, 1 Treadw. 489. The State v. Huntingdon, 1 Treadw. 325. The State v. Doyley, 2 Nott & M’Cord, 121. Vid. 1 Hawk. P. Cr. 154, &ch. 64. 3 Bl. Com.

The decided cases relating to Executors and Administrators, are so numerous and so various, that not being able to adopt any concise arrangement and classification satisfactory to myself, I drew up the following brief notices, in merely chronological order. To arrange a satisfactory digest of our Acts of Assembly and decided cases on the law of Executors and Administrators, including the federal court cases in Dallas, Crauch, Washington, Wheaton, and Peters, would form a considerable volume. The following brief references may have their use, but they occupy too much space to allow me to follow the same plan, as to other subjects.

Trespass, tort, or assumpsit, will survive to executor for goods of the testator carried away in his life-time. Executors of Middleton v. Robinson, 1 Bay, 56.

A legatee must apply for payment of his legacy. Thompson et ux v. Exors. of Youngblood, 1 Bay, 246.

Executors not answerable for what might have been the neglect or mistake of the testator. Legatees of Ash v. Exors. of Ash, 1 Bay, 301.

NOTES.

701

Executor’s authority over the personal estate, is derived from the Ordinary: but a devisee of lands takes directly under the will from the testator. Crossland v. Murdoch, 4 M’Cord, 217.

Though a debt from intestate to administrator may not have fallen due, yet administrator may retain assets to satisfy it, in preference to debts of an interior grade. Ralph <A Co. v. Gist, 4 M’Cord, 267.

The evidence to constitute an Executor de son tori, must be such as shews an intention of exercising a control over the effects of the deceased. A mere removal of goods at the request of the widow, is no evidence of intentional control. Givens v. Higgins, 4 M’Cord, 286.

If Executor makes profest in his declaration, and Defendant pleads to the action, he admits the Executor to be properly in Court. The letters testamentary are then taken out of Court, and cannot afterwards be called for. Warner v. Condy & Raguet, 4 M’Cord, 344. See 2 Nott & M’Cord, 64.

Statute of limitation does not begin to run till administration taken out. Geiger v. Brown, 4 M’Cord, 423. /

An Administrator has no interest in, and has nothing to do with, the real estate of the intestate. Perry v. Brown, 1 Bail. 48.

All acts done by an Administrator in a due and legal course of administration arc valid and binding; though a will be subsequently found and proved and administration revoked : and though that administration had been obtained by a fraudulent suppression of the will. Foster v. Brown, 1 Bail. 221. See 2 Nott & M’Cord, 577. Nor can the Executor maintain Trover against such Administrator. Whether Administrator has properly applied the effects that came duly into his hands, must be tried in another way. Ib.

Until the Executor assent to a legacy of a chattel, the property remains in him. If he permits a stranger to acquire a title to it before he assents to the legatee, the latter, though an infant, is barred as to the stranger. Moore v. Barry, 1 Bail. 504.

An Executor or Administrator may exercise his discretion whether to litigate or surrender goods found in possession of the deceased. He is answerable only on proof of negligence or fraud. Chappell v. Brown, 1 Bail. 528.

An Executor or Administrator cannot avoid a gift of the deceased as fraudulent upon creditors. Ib.

It is no objection in a suit on an administration bond, that plaintiff is a coobligor, or a joint administrator, and has not accounted for his own administration. Ordinary v. Robinson, 1 Bail. 25. It has been often decided that no suit lies on an administration bond, till after a decree either before the Ordinary or in VOL. II. — 91.

Administrator de bonis non, cannot maintain suit on a contract made by the first administrator. The contract is personal, and there is no privity between the first party and the administrator de bonis non. Ross v. Sutton, 1 Bail. 126.

A negotiable note specifically bequeathed, where the maker of the note becomes Executor, is not thereby extinguished: and if the Executor assents and delivers it over, he may be sued upon it by the legal holder. Jackson v. Heath, 1 Bail. 355.

Court will not set off a judgement against an Executor in his individual capacity, against a judgement in his favor, for goods of his testator sold by him, if creditors or legatees may be thereby prejudiced. Talbot v. Harrison, 1 Bail. 599.

In an action by an Administrator for a conversion of the goods of the testator after his death, he sues in his individual capacity, and his administration is part of his title, which must be proved, although defendant has not craved oyer, or pleaded ne unques executor. Browning v. Huff, 2 Bail. 174.

An Executor under a will subsequently set aside, made a lease for a year. Neither the administrator subsequently appointed, or the heir, could bring suit foruse and occupation. Boyd v. Sloan, 2 Bail. 311.

NOTES.

725

To render executor or administrator liable de bonis propriis, there must first be judgement against him in his representative character. Then an action founded on that judgement suggesting a devastavit. Execution de bunis propriis can only issue on a judgement in this last action. Brown v. Hillegas, 2 Hill, 447.

An open account does not bear interest; and an agreement of an administrator to pay interest, will render him personally liable, but will not bind the estate. Ordinary v. Bonner, 2 Hill, 468.

The bona fide assent of the Executor to a legacy, vests it at once in the legatee. After such assent, the sale of the legacy under an execution against the Executor would be set aside. Alexander v. Williams, 2 Hill, 522.

The general rule is, that no trustee shall make profit to himself out of the trust estate. Hence they must account for all the interest which they make and receive'. The rule adopted is to charge them with interest on annual balances, except for the current year. Davis v. Wright, 2 Hill, 560. This rule is founded on the Act of 1789, which requires annual returns of receipts and expenditures, forming an account stated, on which interest is due. Ib. Prima facie, executor and administrator are liable for the sale bill, and the onus of getting rid of it, lies upon them : but they are not chargeable with interest on the sale bill till the end of the current year in which it falls due.

Executor assents to a legacy on personal property: he cannot on failure of assets pursue the legacy against the claims of creditors who have obtained judgement against the legatee. Executors of Drayton v. Glen Drayton et al. 1 Eq. Rep. 557. But he becomes personally liable himself after the assets are exhausted. Ib.

Executor may purchase, (if without fraud) at his own sales. Ib. 567.

(I doubt if this dictum of Chancellor Matthews would now be considered as law. The general rule of equity in cases of trust sales, I apprehend to be this : no person in whatever character, confidentially entrusted to sell for the benefit of another, and who undertakes so to do, can purchase at his own sale for the benefit of himself. Unless with leave of the Court, on a statement by affidavit, of special facts that will render the permission expedient. The court has not considered such irregular purchases as absolutely void, but as voidable even after a lapse of many years, on the application of persons interested in the estate. The principle would have justified the Court, as I think, in considering them as void; in preventing the evil rather than curing it; but the current of decisions has gone no farther than voidable. I apprehend this maxim applies to attorneys, solicitors, agents, factors, and every person acting as a trustee. It is to be hoped, this wholesome rule of legal morality, will not be frittered away, as many others have been, by distinctions, limitations and exceptions — temptation loopholes for fraud to creep in. — Edit.) But see Trimmier v. Trail, 2 Bail. 480.

Executor making sales, and not taking proper securities, is liable, if the purchaser becomes insolvent. Ib. and 1 Eq. Rep. 304, 515.

Testator directs a division of his estate. This is no authority to the Executor to divide it. Shoolbred v. Drayton, 2 Eq. Rep. 250, in note.

A widow about to marry, settles her interest in her former husband’s estate with the knowledge of her intended husband : the settlement valid. (The reference in the Index is inaccurate.)

A joint administrator cannot sue the securities in an administration bond, as creditors may. Nor are the sureties primarily liable in a court of equity ; for in general, the law will afford an adequate remedy. Hoell et ux v. Blanchard et al. 4 Eq. Rep. 24.

Nor is the bill filed too soon, although there be outstanding debts. Ib. 342.

A partial devisee may call executor to account as to the fund in which he is interested. Ib. 345.

An Executor cannot sell a specific legacy unless the debts of the estate require it; least of all for his own debt. Executor cannot sell personal estate, without leave of the Ordinary, under Act of 1789. If lie be interested in part of a legacy this does not authorize him to sell more than his own share. Saxon et ux v. Barksdale et al. 4 Eq. Rep. 522.

An executor must apply to a jury for compensation for extra services, per Act of May, 1745. Ruft'et et al v. Exors. of Summers, 4 Eq. Rep. 529.

What commissions and compensations are allowed on extraordinary occasions. Logan v. Logan, 1 M’Cord’s Cli. Rep.

Executor cannot receive more than 2| per cent, for receiving and 2^ per cent, for paying money. If he claims extra compensation, he must go to a jury. On a quant, mer. no difference between services rendered and money paid. lb.

Executor’s commissions coverall ordinary expenses. He will not be allowed money paid to an accountant for drawing out executor’s accounts. But the Court, without sending him to a jury, will allow him for aid in adjusting difficult and complicated accounts of the estate, counsel’s fees, overseer’s wages, &c. Ib.

Executor ought to make his return annually, to prevent complicated accounts. Ib.

Lands may be sold under an execution against executor or administrator, tho’ there may be personal estate. Smith ct al. Exors. of Cripps v. Exors. of Smith. 1 M’Cord. Ch. Rep. 148.

The executor or administrator of a deceased person only, can maintain an action for an account due the deceased. Davis v. Rhame, 1 M’Cord, Ch. Rep. 191.

NOTES.

Lis pendens is not notice to all the world: it is so to the parties interested in the suit, and to purchasers of litigated property. Ib. 264.

Land is assets for the payment of debts. Gregory’s exor. v. Forrester, 1 M’Cord, Ch. Rep. 324.

Personal property does not descend to the heir at law. Ib.

Generally, executor or administrator is the only organ through whom the next of kin can have his rights ascertained, or a creditor get at the funds of the estate, or to whomadebtor is answerable, except where executor is bankrupt or will not act. Ib.

To enable a legatee to proceed against a debtor, there must be special circumstances, as collusion, insolvency, &c. Ib.

In what cases a bill may be brought by a creditor against a legatee. Ib.

To make a party liable as Executor de son tort, he must be sued as Executor, lb.

It is still unsettled how far Executors and Administrators may exercise control over the lands of the deceased. Ib.

Lands may be sold under a judgment obtained against an executor or administrator. Where there is no executor or administrator, a bill will lie against the heir at law for the proceeds of lands which he has said ; the personal estate being fully administered. Ib.

A power in a will to sell such property of the testator as is useless to the estate, will not authorize the executor to sell any property he chuses. M’Cantsv. Bee, 1 M’Cord’s Eq. Rep. 393.

Where a suit is brought against an executor, and all the creditors are advertised to come in by a day given, though a party come in afterwards, he may be let in, if the funds arc yet in the control of the Court; he paying such expenses as the delay may render reasonable. U. States v. Shubrick’s Exor. 1 M’Cord’s Ch. Rep. 406.

An order for distribution before the debts are paid, will not be made till the executors are secured. Trescott v. Trescott’s Adm'rs. 1 M’Cord’s Ch. Rep. 430.

The representatives of an Executor or Administrator fire liable for a devastavit committed by him. Even in the case of Exor. de son tort. Ib.

Where legatees have received their portion before the debts are paid, a creditor may fde his bill against both the executor and legatees for an account. The general principle is, that the executor must first account: but there are many exceptions. Ib.

The liabilities and commissions of an Executor considered. Tavaux et ux v. Ball, Ib. 458.

The general rule is, that executors are liable to interest for funds remaining in their hands, whether they use them to their own profit or not. Ib. Except where money is prudently retained to meet exigencies, or to wait for investment. Ib. The executor of a planting estate is liable for interest only on the annual balances; and six months are allowed afterwards to make investments. Ib.

An Executor is allowed ten per cent, for investing funds at interest, and also 2j for the final disposal or payment of it under the directions of the will. But not where the fund is still under his control, and the disposition not final. Ib.

Reasonable caution and diligence is required of an Executor. He is not liable, if his factor having allowed a few’ days credit in the usual course of business, the purchaser fails, lb.

Legal assets are first liable to all liens existing at the death of the debtor, before distribution by the executors. Rutledge’s Adm’r. v. Hasleherst. Ib. 468.

NOTES.

731

Outstanding debts are legal assets, and must be so applied. Equitable assets are such as can only be made effectual by the aid of a court of equity, and are subject to the rules of equity. Legal assets are distributable according to the act. Ib.

Where an Executor receives money on a bond or judgment, and retains it, it stands against him only as a simple contract debt. Rolain v. Derby, 1 M’Cord’s Ch. Rep. 476.

No person but an administrator can sue at law or in equity for the property of an intestate. Farley v. Farley, 1 M’Cord’s Eq. Rep. 514.

None but the executor or administrator can call another person to account for any thing due the deceased. Ib.

Executors, how they shall account and pay interest. Black et al. v. Blakely,

2 M’CorcTs Ch. Rep. p. 1, and Wright v. Wright, 200 et seq.

No commissions allowed unless the accounts are plain and intelligible. Black et al v. Blakely, Ib. p. 6.

An Executor may at all times apply to the Chancellor for directions. Ib. 7.

Ordinary must strike out all charges not properly vouched. Ib. 8. And Wright v. Wright, same vol. 197. He may allow time to produce vouchers: Ib. 8. Not allowed commissions for those years when he does not produce accurate annual accounts. Ib. 9, and Wright v. Wright, Ib. 195.

Executor charged with costs where his conduct is improper. Ib. 9.

Where annual rests for interest ought to be allowed. Ib. 10, 202.

Equity jurisdiction and practice. Butler v. Ardis, 2 M’Cord’s Ch. Re. 60.

Entitled to be refunded costs and counsel fee paid in a cause against the estate. Warden v. Burts, 2 M’Cord’s Ch. Rep. 76, 77, 82 ; and all bona fide advances.

Charged with interest from the time of receiving the fund to the commencement of the suit, and for all principal and interest he has received. M’Caw et ux v. Blewitt, Ib. 103.

He cannot convert a gratuitous undertaking into a demand. Ib. 104.

Bill filed against Executor for a debt due from the estate, for which he had given his own note, need not include legatees, no distribution having taken place. Douglas v. Frazer, Ib. 106. His note does not exempt the estate from liability : Ib.111.

The next of kin, exclusively entitled, cannot maintain a suit in equity for the recovery of property till he has administered. Bradford v. Felder, Ib. 169. But the decree may be suspended till he has taken out administration ; which he may state as a fact, by way of amendment. Ib. 169.

An Executor recovered against an Administrator in his (the executor’s) own right. The testator’s estate was indebted to the administrator. The executor and administrator mutually settled these cross claims by an agreement. The Court will support that agreement, although one of the parties to it has left the State. Nettles v. Elkius, Ib. 182.

The Executor is the only proper representative of the estate, and is the party to be sued. A legatee may be sued with him, but not without him. Non-residents in the State cannot be made parties unless they have property in the State. Winstanley v. Savage, 2 M’Cord’s Ch. Rep. 438.

An administratrix allowed sums expended for the clothing and education of the children, prior to notice, and while the estate was deemed insolvent. Darby v. Darby’s Creditors, Ib. 451.

Maintenance must be paid out of income. Teague v. Dendy, 2 M’Cord’s Ch. Rep, 211, and M’Dowell & Caldwell, Ib. 43.

732

NOTES.

An executor not allowed commissions unless he makes his annual returns to be examined by the Ordinary. 2 M’Cord’s Ch. Rep. 195, Wright v. Wright: And if the executor has done his duty, he is entitled to commissions on the aggregate sum paid over to the distributees. Ib. He is entitled also to commissions on money placed out at interest either in his own hands or those of others. Ib. He is also entitled to 10 per cent, on the accumulation of money which he has placed out at interest; but not when he is decreed to pay it over at the conclusion of his administration on moneys retained by him. Ib. 195.

The inventory is the only evidence a party interested in an estate can produce against an executor ; but that is conclusive against him, and he must show how he has disposed of the property. Ib. The Ordinary should not allow an executor’s accounts unless the proper vouchers be produced, or their acceptance accounted for. Ib. 197. The Ordinary’s return should shew the nature of the evidence on which it is founded. Ib. Also, Black et al v. Blakely, same vol. p. 6.

An Executor may show that there is a mistake in his return : otherwise he is bound by it. Ib. 198. Although the evidence produced before the Ordinary is not conclusive in favour of the return, it should be received for as much as it is worth, and circumstances to be taken into consideration. Ib.

An Ordinary is not to be presumed to have passed accounts without sufficient evidence of their correctness: and therefore accounts passed sixteen years ago, ought to be a sufficient protection to the executor; subject however to impeachment by those who bring the proofs of incorrectness or fraud. Ib. 197.

An Executor cannot sell without permission of the Ordinary; if he does, he is chargeable with interest. Ib. 198.

If he suffers the family of the testator to take possession of property, they are his agents, and he must account for it. Ib. 199.

He has no right to exceed the income of the estate, or to contract debts for any purpose without the leave of the Court. Ib. At least he is bound to show that any advances beyond the income were necessary and prudent. Ib. The Court, on application, will allow such provision out of the estate, as may be necessary. Ib.

If an Executor exhibit his account embracing several years, he will be allowed commissions on that year only when his account is rendered. If the transactions of each year are not kept distinct, no commissions ought to be allowed. Ib. 200.

The question of annual rests considered. Ib. 200.

Interest is due on interest, where the will directs an annual payment to the legatee. Ib. 202.

But interest is not to be calculated with annual rests, on monies in an Executor’s hands; though some cases may require it. Ib. As if the Executor keeps the funds against the direction of the will, he must pay interest with annual rests. Ib. 203. The same strictness not required in this State as in England, on account of the difficulty of investing funds here. Ib.

Disobedience to the directions of the will, or calling in money which is accumulating, or using it for his own purposes, will render the Executor liable to annual rests. Ib. 204.

All profits belong to cestui que trust. Ib.

For the rule for calculating interest on partial payments, see Ib. 204.

Defendant purchased corn of a widow who had not been appointed executrix or administratrix ; of which he was not apprised. This does not make him Executor de son tort. Johnson v. Gaither, 1 Harper’s Rep. 6.

NOTES.

733

Administrators are liable, de bonis propriis, when they plead a plea which is found against them, or is untrue in fact. Smith v. Goggans, lb. 52.

An Executor who did not qualify, sold a slave belonging to the estate, but not in his capacity of exectxtor. Held, that he must be considered as having sold as executor, though he had not proved the will, or named himself executor in the bill of sale. He who does an act which he cannot effectually do unless in a particular capacity and character, will be presumed to have so done it. May-wood Ads. of Legge, lb. 116.

An Executor authorized by the will to sell land, must convey the land himself; he cannot convey by attorney. Black v. Erwin, lb. 411.

An infant purchased a horse, and gave a promissory note. His administrator may set up the plea of infancy against the note. Tie sold the horse as part of the intestate’s estate : this is no confirmation of the infant’s purchase. Counts v. Bates, lb. 464.

Much good matter as to Executors and Administrators is to be found in Serjeant Williams’s notes to Saunders’s Reports.

For Pirates and Robbers at Sea. 27 Hen. 8, ch, 4, 1535. p. 465.

See statute of 28 Hen. 8, ch. 15, 1536; and Act of Assembly 27 Feb. 1788.

Piracy at sea, is that kind of depredation and robbery which would be a felony on land. 1 Hawk. P. C. ch. 37, sect. 10.

The attempt of the English fanatics to make the slave trade piracy is an unjustifiable legislation for other nations, on a subject which belongs to the jurisprudence exclusively of each foreign nation ; the hasty coincidence of opinion of Judge Story, notwithstanding. That the slave trade has been and is subject to great abuses, no one can dispute; not more than the factory system of England: but the compulsory jurisprudence of Great Britain on the subject, is an assumption of unauthorized jurisdiction, and an arrogant domination over other nations, which ought not to be submitted to. We, of the United States, have abolished the slave trade from Africa, by the laws of the United States ; but I hope we shall defend that measure on the ground of our own rights, and refuse to call it piracy in obedience to British dictation.

Statute concerning Marriage. 32 Hen. 8, ch. 38, 1540. p. 475. See 1 Jas. 1, ch. 11, p. 508.

In this State, marriage is a civil contract of mutual partnership and personal cohabitation during life, under the provisions of the laws passed on this subject. The parties are, the man, the woman, and the State. The State is interested that the contract shall be fulfilled beneficially for the progeny, of whom the future citizens are to be composed. The contract in South Carolina is held to be indissoluble from whatever cause but death ; no divorce a vinculo matrimonii ever having been granted in South Carolina. Vaigneur et al v. Kirk : (See 2 Eq. Rep. 644, note.) Many theoretical objections, of a very grave character, may be made against this State doctrine, but as yet it appears to work well ; and there is no ground from past experience to justify any change in the received law on the subject.

NOTES.

By 9 Geo. 2, ch. 5, the Stat. 1 Jac. 1, ch. 12, 1603, is repealed, except so much as repeals the Stat. 5 Eliz. ch. 16, and it inflicts the punishment of the pillory upon persons who pretend to witchcraft, fortune-telling, &c. But the Act of 9 Geo. 2, ch. 5, not being made in force in the Colonies and Plantations, leaves the law on the subject now, as it was when 1 Jac. 1, ch. 12 was adopted by our Act of Assembly of December 12,1712. A Court of Law may declare void an Act of Assembly as being unconstitutional, because the Constitution is the paramount law of the land, and the Judges are sworn to the observance of it, but who can tell the circumstances, or prescribe the limitation of time, when a law shall become obsolete, which the Legislature has not thought fit to repeal ? There are already too many temptations presented to our Courts to usurp legislative authority, and enact judge-made law, which by the convenient courtesy of the Courts and the Bar, is comprehended under the title of common law ; Blacks. Comm, book 1, p. 71-73. Some periodical arrangement for correcting this almost unavoidable tendency, is needed in the present day. The decision of the Court of King’s Bench in England on Abraham Thornton’s case, 1814, is conclusive authority against the power of a Court to declare a Law .obsolete, which the Legislature suffers to remain.

In the 33 Hen. 8, ch. 8, A.D. 1541, an Act was passed, making it felony to practice or cause to be practiced conjuration, witchcraft, enchantment, or any sorcery, to get money, or to consume any person in his body, members or goods, or to provoke any person to unlawful love, or for the despight of Christ or lucre of money to pull down any cross, or to declare where goods stolen, be.

This Statute of Hen. 8, was among others creating new felonies, repealed indirectly by 1 Ed. 6, ch. 12, A.D. 1547, and by 1 Mary, Stat. 1, ch. 1. A Statute against witchcraft was afterwards.enacted by 5 El. ch. 16, A. D..1563, which was partially repealed, together with 1 Jas. 1, ch. 12, by 9 Geo. 2, ch. 5, 1736.

It may create some surprise, that our ancestors in 1712, gave countenance to the reality of witchcraft and the dealing with evil spirits: but the question has difficulties attending it, which press upon the minds of many persons even in our day.

There are two modes of estimating the collection of ancient tracts called the Old Testament. One, that they are throughout the dictate of divine inspiration, and as such to be considered and implicitly obeyed. Another, that they are the-compositions of historical writers at or about the time of the events, written in the style and manner, and tinctured with the common opinions and prejudices of the age and country when and where the authors lived. This last opinion is deduced from and founded on the universal belief of the Jewish and Christian church till the 4th century of the Christian era, that the treatises in question were compiled, composed, or collected, and published by the prophet Ezra or Esdras, some time subsequent to the return of the Israelites from the Babylonish captivity. To the Jews and early Christians these were inspired books, because Ezra or Esdras was an inspired writer. Others argue, that if Ezra made this compilation, the respective authors of the books ought reasonably to be considered as having written under the usual influence of opinions, well or ill founded, prevalent amorfg the people they addressed, common in their day, and therefore naturally entertained by themselves.

The first opinion, is adopted by all the advocates of plenary inspiration.

The second, opinion, by all those who are disinclined to admit miraculous interposition, and supernatural dictation, without absolute necessity — by men who

say, “ these are historical writings contemporary or traditional; and to be judged of according to the usual rules of judging historical narrations.”

Upon these two conflicting theories of explanation, I shall leave the reader to decide for himself, my own opinion being of little consequence : the decided cases show that the law has adopted the first opinion.

Comyns, in his Digest, p. 367 of the original edition, has given the authorities for the slanderous and actionable character of the following expressions.

He is a witch, and did bewitch my child : though he do not shew any damage consequent thereon.

He is a witch and bewitched me.

He is a witch and bewitched my wife’s milk.

Or my mother’s drink.

Or my cattle, mare, Arc.

He is a strong witch and bewitched me and my aunt, and therefore I will not marry him.

She is a witch and was convicted at the assizes.

The Devil appears to thee and thou conferrest with him, and whatever thou askest, he gives thee.

She sacrificed her child to the Devil with intent to bewitch A.

Thou art a witch and shall suffer for it.

Thou art a witch and deservest to be hanged.

She is a witch, and if she cross me, I will hang her for it.

The ancient mode of ascertaining in England whether a woman was a witch, among the populace, was to tie her neck and heels and throw her into a pond; if she swam, the proof was undeniable : if she sank, she was acquitted, but then she was probably drowned.

Quere, in the days of Godbold, Rolle, Croke, &c. suppose a young woman was addressed thus in respect of one of her admirers — thou hast bewitched that young man, he can do nothing but thy bidding — would it have been actionable, seriously spoken ?

Attempts have been made to quibble away the scripture reality of witchcraft, as if the crime denounced was not a reality, but a pretence and an imposture only. Perhaps the persons who so argue, have not carefully perused and considered the following texts in this connection :

1 Sam. xxxviii, 7. As to the Witch of Endor. 1 Chron. x, 13.

22Exod. 18. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

18 Deut. 10. There shall not be a witch among you.

2 Chron. xxxiii, 6. Manasseh used witchcraft and enchantments.

5 Galat. 20. The works of the flesh are idolatry, witchcraft, &c.

The numerous passages relating to evil spirits, and unclean spirits, both in the old and new Testament.

20 Levit. 27. A man or woman with a familiar spirit to be condemned to death.

29 Isaiah 4. Thy voice is as of one who hath a familiar spirit.

To the same purpose, 19 Lev. 31 ; 20 Lev. 6; 18 Deut. 11; 1 Sam. xxviii, 3, 9 ; 2 Kings, xxi, 6 ; 2 Kings, xxiii, 24 ; 8 Isaiah, 19; 19 Isaiah, 3.

In all these passages the crime of dealing with evil and familiar spirits, and the real existence of such beings, is plainly, unequivocally, positively asserted ; like any other real fact.

In no part of scripture are witches or dealers with evil and familiar spirits, considered as mere jugglers and impostors. They are not spoken of or pronounced as criminal because they were cheats and pretenders, but because they

NOTES.

really had an alliance and intercourse with evil spirits. The shifts oi modern expounders to get rid of the plain meaning of the text, imply a charge of careless omission or deceptive ambiguity in the scripture writers.

It is difficult for an advocate of the plenary inspiration of the scriptures, to deny, in the character of a real and consistent Christian, the reality of the offence of witchcraft. I would not press into the service of this argument, Wierius or Delrio, or Mr. G. Sinclair’s ‘Satan’s Invisible World discovered,’ or the ignorant piety of Mr. Baxter in his small treatise on Witchcraft — nor the condemnation and burning of William Cole and Allinson Dick at Kirkaldy in 1636, for witchcraft, (Statistics of Scotland, vol. 18,) — nor the very curious and authentic account of the confession of Amy Simpson and several other witches, who were upon their own confession burnt alive in Scotland about the year 1586, as related in the memoirs of Sir James Melville, fol. p. 194, London, A.D. 1683 — nor the precious specimen of credulous fanaticism of Cotton Mather, in his Life of Sir W. Phips, 1 Magnolia, 185-192 — nor the more detailed account of the New England witchcraft-murders in 1691 and 1692, as given by Neale in his History of the Puritans, vol. 1, p. 124 — nor shall I rely on the very ingenious treatise on witchcraft by Mr. Glanville, a book not easy to be replied to, — but I may fairly cite as authorities for the existence of w itchcraft, the examination and execution of thirteen witches, deliberately condemned on evidence in open court by Sir Matthew Hale — I may cite the acknowledgements of Sir W. Blackstone, of Mr. Addison, of Dr. Johnson — and though last not least, the very learned charge of our Chief Justice Trott of South Carolina, still extant in manuscript, though at present somewhere mislaid in Charleston; undoubtedly the most learned and elaborate defence of the existence of witchcraft as a crime, that I have had an opportunity of perusing. Whatever therefore may be the opinions of the educated and enlightened part of the community in the present day, very many persons of good sense, as well as Christian piety, have been, and many still remain, firm believers in the reality and occasional existence of this presumed crime.

I have received on this subject a letter from a friend, of which the following extract will prove that the notions of real witchcraft, its influence and operations, are hardly yet eradicated among us.

“Winnsboro’, April 26, 1837.

“Dear Sir — In reply to yours of the 22nd, I answer that I was never concerned in a case of witchcraft. Some years ago, Stephen D. Miller, Esq. defended seven or eight persons who were indicted at Lancaster for assault, battery and false imprisonment. The defence was, that an old woman, the prosecutrix, residing in Chesterfield, had maltreated, by diabolical arts, a poor girl residing in Lancaster; and that the persons indicted, acting from the best advice procurable, went to the old woman, gently laid their hands on her, and brought her into Lancaster, to touch the abused girl, and say over her ‘ God bless you ’! That the significant words had been pronounced with the proper ceremony, and the girl instantly recovered. Judge David Johnson presided, and I suppose with a view to look somewhat into the grounds of defence as a matter of curiosity, permitted the girl to be sworn. She testified that being fatigued one evening at her labors, she lay down to rest; Barbara Powers, the prosecutrix, came in'and sat upon her, and choked her with great violence. After this, Barbara raised her up, converted her into a horse, rode her to Lancaster village, went through the keyhole into several shops, brought out goods of great value, loaded her with them, and rode her into Chesterfield with her booty. Barbara subsequently rode her to Cheraw, and proceeding in like manner, obtained bags of goods, and rode her back to her residence. With the severity of her almost incessant hardships in the service of the witch, her health and strength greatly declined. Here the Judge interposed, and cut off all further testimony. This happened about 1813 or 1814.

“In the year 1792, witches abounded in Fairfield. Many a poor girl was thought to be sadly afflicted by these miscreants, and not a few young persons of the other sex. In fact, to so great a length did they carry their terrible enmities to a numerous list of individuals, that to relieve the sufferers, it was deemed necessary to give the witches a trial, and if found guilty of the charges alleged against them, to punish them with signal severity. In that year, a court composed of witch-doctors, was held at the house of a Mr. Thomas Hill, five miles below Winnsboro’. Four persons were tried, found guilty, and punished by stripes and burning their feet at a bark fire, so that the soles came off. I can barely remember to have seen one of the sisterhood in the hands of the officer of this court, a poor old German woman of 70 years of age, going to the place of trial; and afterwards to have seen the scars of the cow-skin on her arms and shoulders. The sufferers brought suits in the county court of Fairfield, and the defence was fully gone into in each case. The plaintiffs recovered nominal damages. From that day to this, we have not had occasion to complain of the dealings of witch or wizzard among any of our people, I am in possession of the bulk of the evidence delivered on the trial of these poor old people, and if you desire it can detail it with a good deal of exactness. Judge Johnson will no doubt remember the case of Barbara Powers. Yours, &c.

The classes of cases under the heads nudum pactum, and specific performance, often bear upon this statute. The case of Hall v. Hall, 2 M’Cord’s Ch. Rep. 273, citing Cooth v. Jackson, 6 Vez. 12, and Givens v. Calder, 2 Desauss. Eq. Rep. 171, is refreshing to a lawyer; for this salutary statute was in great danger of being frittered away by exceptions so numerous, founded on slight distinctions, that the broad wholesome rule was buried under the exceptions. It is not always that a distinction in circumstances, implies a difference in principle. The French maxim, as reported by Chancellor D’Aguasseau, of making the case bend to the principle, instead of the principle to the case, deserves consideration.

Judge Grimke refers to the 43rd and 44th section of the Jury Law of 1731, and to the Sedition Act of 1776 : but I apprehend it is doubtful whether any law concerning treason anterior to our Constitution of 1790, can be of force since that time. I know of no treason law in this State as yet.

An Act to enable his Majesty's natural born Subjects to inherit the Estate of their Ancestors, either lineal or collateral, notwithstanding their Father or Mother were Aliens. 11. 12 Wm. 3. ch. 6, 1700. p. 542.

For the “ King’s dominions,” substitute “the State of South Carolina.”

See the case of Campbell v. Gordon, 6 Cranch, 176, 182.

Whether “ a natural born subject of a State is under an obligation to perpetual allegiance,” is a vexed question ; which, with us, has been frequently brought up before the federal courts, but has never been expressly decided, except perhaps in Capt. Williams’s case, before Judge Jay, reported in a note in Dallas’s reports. See also, Talbot v. Jansen, 3 Dali. 133 ; Murray v. the Charming Betsey, 1 Cranch, 64; the Sanctissima Trinidad, 7 Wheaton’s Rep. 283. The popular leaning of this country is against the obligation to perpetual allegiance ; on the broad ground, that as the happiness of the individual is the only natural and reasonable rule of his conduct in the choice of a domicil for life, and as Governments furnish only the public means and motives to that end, each individual should be allowed to choose for himself the government which best suits his inclination and condition : in which case the best government will meet with the most encouragement. The opposite doctrines of England and of America on this subject, constitute the foundation of the national disputes as to the right of search for, and imprisonment of, native citizens. Our admission of foreigners under the laws for Naturalization, proves nothing ; for it is not our business to inquire whether the foreigner applying for admittance, assumes inconsistent obligations; that is his affair.

The case of Capt. Williams implies, that whether a citizen may throw off his allegiance to his native State or not, as a right in theory, the exercise of this right

748

NOTES.

and the mode of putting off his character as a citizen, must be prescribed by Act of Congress. For the contract has two parties, the State and the citizen; and neither can throw off its obligations, ad libitum. The commercial law both of England and of the United States, allows a citizen to acquire a commercial domicil in a foreign country, for purposes of trade.

These three Acts are so manifestly superceded by modern law practice and legislation, as to be of no validity at present. They are inserted by Grimke under the 11th section of the Act of December 12, 1712.

No. 322. To put in force in this Province, the several Statutes of the Kingdom of England or South Britain therein mentioned. Section 5, December 12, 1712, p. 401.

The 5th section of this Act declares that all and every part of the Common Law of England, where the same is not altered by the above enumerated Acts, or inconsistent with the particular constitutions, customs and laws of this Province, excepting so much thereof as hath relation to the ancient tenures which are taken away by Act of 12 Ch. 2, ch. 24, which establishes the tenure by free and common Socage, is hereby enacted and declared to be in full force, except that part of the common law that relates to matters Ecclesiastical.

What is meant by the Common Law? I give the meanings of writers of authority.

1st. The collection of unwritten rules, maxims and customs, that obtained force by common usage, among our Saxon ancestors previous to the time of King Alfred. See 1 Blackstone’s Commentaries, p. 63-74, in Mr. Peters’s edition, with the collected notes and comments of Christian, Chitty and Peters.

2nd. The republication of the Liberjudicialis, or Dombee of King Alfred, by Edward the Confessor. Ibid. This was the collection that then constituted the Common law or Folcricht. Ib.

3rd. Ib. p. 71. “Upon the whole, however, we may take it as a general rule, that the decisions of Courts of Justice, are the evidences of what is Common Law. These decisions are made upon the exercise not of a vague and humoursome but of a sound legal discretion. Rex v. Willis, 4 Burr. 2539. Wilson v. Rastall, 4 Term Rep. 737. Admitting of argument ab inconvenienti, where the law is not yet positively settled by past legal decisions, but not where the number of decided cases leaves no room for doubt. Haig. Co. Litt. 66. Beard v. Webb, 2 Bos. and Pull. 109. See note to p. 70 of 1 Bl. Comm. Peters’s edition, for arguments on both sides. A sound, legal, discretion ! Is not this somewhat like discretionary discretion ? Like Dr. Rush’s description or definition of disease, morbid action?

4th. In the great case of literary property, Millon v. Taylor, 4 Burr. Rep. 2303, the four Judges, Willes, Aston, Yates, and Lord Mansfield, severally gave their respective notions of what constituted Common Law. One declares that the principles of private justice, moral fitness, and public convenience, make Common Law, without a precedent: another that it is drawn from natural and moral philosophy, from the civil and canon law, from logic, from use, custom, and conversation among men, collected out of the general disposition, nature,

and condition of humankind: a third says that immemorial usage alone constitutes it: a fourth, that it is what is agreeable to the principles of right and wrong, the fitness of things, convenience and policy : a fifth declares it is what is to be found in the opinions of lawyers delivered as axioms, or to be collected from universal and immemorial usage; per Lord Kenyon in Ball v. Herbert, 3 Term Rep. 361. Blandell v. Catterall, 5 B. and Aid. 263. A sixth says that common error is a source of common law, communis error fac'd jus, per Holt C. .T. India Co. v. Skinner, Comberback, 242. Lord Mansfield, in derision of ancient common law decisions, said, “we do not sit here to take our law from Siderfin and Keble,” and he proscribed every case in Bernardiston’s Rep. 2 Burr. Rep. 1142, in note. Of the 12 volumes of modern reports, how many are law? Look also at Greenleaf’s collection of cases doubted, denied and overruled.

Who can say after this, that there is any precise meaning to be annexed to the phrase continually in the mouth of every lawyer, the Common Law? I feel myself therefore at liberty to offer my own definition of it.

Common Law, is all that part of the Law, which is not expressly enacted as Statutory Law, by the Legislature. All that is anterior to 1225, and every thing subsequent not expressly enacted by Act of Assembly. And it comprises all the customs, usages, and practice of Law in the Courts, whether to be found in books or not; and all the Judge-enacted law to be found in the books of reports of common and chancery law ; and in the treatises that have received the positive sanction of Courts of Law ; as Littleton’s Tenures, Coke’s Commentary on Littleton, &c. &c. Nine-tenths of what usually and technically is considered as comprised in the term common law, consists of the decisions of the Courts — judge-made law, which is made common law by the courtesy of Westminster Hall, and the obsequious acquiescence of our American Courts. Those decisions, notwithstanding about 1500 doubts and denials up to the present day, comprize avast body of useful, practical good sense, intermixed with no small proportion of technical quibble, absurdity, and chicane. Lord Bacon called aloud for a codifica-cation of the law in his day (he died 1626 :) at present the general opinion of the Bar is decidedly adverse to such an attempt in England and this country; whether this prevailing opinion be based on any well-founded experience of the inutility of codes, digests, and condensation — on any plain argument that the public would lose, by getting rid of fiction, falsehood, verbiage, repetition, and technical obscurity — remains yet to be shewn. I incline to think that two persons could well digest into plain and intelligible propositions the whole of our statute law, in two years : that our chancery law would require equal care and labor: and-our common law in its broad acceptation, as much. Our criminal law might occupy one person for one year. Whether the result would justify the expense, may be a matter of doubt. At present, the law puts on too much of the character of MYSTERY.

By this 5th section, the Chancery Law of England is in like manner adopted. Chancery is a Court where the complainant and defendant commence litigation by-bill, and by an answer thereto on oath. It is a Court resorted to, to get at the necessary facts through the parties to the suit, who are compelled to answrer upon oath, interrogatories embracing the whole case.

The Chancellor claims 1st, Common Law jurisdiction. 2nd, Equity jurisdiction. 3rd, Statutory jurisdiction. 4th, Especial delegated jurisdiction.

First, as to common law jurisdiction. See Maddock’s treatise on the principles and practice of the high Court of Chancery, vol. 1, and Mr. Cooper's history of the Court of Chancery, 1828.

75:

NOTES.

Secondly, to equity jurisdiction. Accident. Fraud. Account, superceding the old action of account-render. General guardianship of infants. Specific performance. Trust. In the three first of these, common law claims jurisdiction also. The bill of peace; and the bill to cancel deeds and documents may be added here.

Thirdly, statutory jurisdiction. Bankruptcies. Tythes. Jews. Our more cautious and liberal Legislation excludes these subjects. Trusts including public charities and corporations. Infant Trustees. Mortgages. See several other classes enumerated in Parke’s history of the Court of Chancery, 424.

Fourthly, specially delegated jurisdiction. Idiots and Lunatics. Censor Morum. Licenser of the Press. See on this last head the class of cases decided by Lord Eldon, in the very essence and spirit of judicial bigotry and absurdity, of which the injunction case of Lawrence v. Smith, March 1822, is a leading decision.

The Wellesby case, and that of Blythe Shelly, establish the Chancellor’s jurisdiction as Censor Morum. The power of the Court may be doubted in these cases: but there can be no doubt it was extended beyond what we of this country should have submitted to. I am not prepared to object to the principle. Whatever doubts there may be as to the meaning and definition of Common Law, something of the “palpable obscure” rests over Equity also.

From 1 Blacks. Comm. Tntr. Sec. 2 and 3.

Equity thus depending essentially on the particular circumstances of each individual case, there can be no established rules and fixed principles of Equity laid down without destroying its very essence and reducing it to positive law.

What Equity is, and how impossible in its very essence to be reduced to stated rules, hath been shewn in the preceding section.

By Lord Ch. J. Vaughan ; argument on the case in Chancery, term, pasch. 22 ch. 2. See Parke’s Hist, of the Court of Chancery, p. 459.

I wonder to hear of citing of cases of Presidents in matters of Equity;, for if there be equity in a case, that equity is an universal truth and there can be no president in it. So that in any president that can be produced, if it be the same with this case, the reason and equity is the same in itself: and if the president be not the same case with this, it is not to be cited, as being nothing to the purpose.

From'3 Blacks. Comm. ch. 27.

Once more it hath been said that a Court of Equity is not bound by rules and precedents, but acts from the opinion of the Judge founded on the circumstances of each particular case. Whereas the system of our Courts of Equity, is a laboured connected system, governed by established rules and bound down by precedents, from which they do not depart, although the reason of some of them may perhaps be liable to objection.

Per Lord Keeper Bridgenian. Parke’s Hist, of the Court of Chancery, 459.

Certainly precedents are very necessary and useful to us, for in them we may find the reason of the equity to guide us. And besides, - the authority of those that made them is much to be regarded. We should suppose they did it on great consideration, and weighing of the matter: and it would be very strange and very ill, if we should disturb and set aside what hath been the course for a long series of time and ages.

The Roman Pnetors published in an Album, the rules and maxims by which their decisions would be guided. This was much approved by Lord Bacon, De aug. scient. L. 8, ch. 3, 46. But in the code Napoleon, Tit. qnelim. Art. 5. II est defendu au juges de prononcer par voie de disposition generale et regle-mentaire, sur les causes que leur sont soumises.

NOTES.

753

But discretionary power, as Lord Camden observes, is the law of tyranny. And the good sense of modern times regards Equity as a system of rales of practice, and general maxims, deduced from the experience and known bearing of repeated and well-considered decisions ; admitting of somewhat more latitude (of necessity) than the stare decisis maxim of the Common Law; but still making past experience the basis of present decision, and limiting as far as possible the wanderings of mere discretion. We resort to Equity now, chielly front the convenience of its practical forms, opening the doors for the admission of truth, which Common Law too tightly closes. If the viva voce examination and cross examination of the parties were admitted into practice, the improvement would in my opinion be invaluable. See review of Bentham on Judicial Evidence,

(The following is extracted from number 1608 of the South Carolina Gazette revived, dated “ Thursday, Oct. 31, 1765, to Monday, June 2, 1666.” I refer to this Presentment, principally on account of the fourth article. But there are so many allusions to the customs and habits of that day, that I am of opinion the public will forgive me for inserting the whole Presentment.)

SOUTH-CAROLINA.

The Presentments of the Grand Jurors for the body of this Province, at a Court

of General Sessions of the Peace, Oyer and Terminer, Assize and General Goal

delivery, begun and holders in Charlestown, the 16th day of October, in the year

of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and sixty-five.

I. We present as a very great grievance, the want of county Courts being established for the ease of the inhabitants of the back parts of this Province, as in other of his Majesty’s northern Provinces.

II. We present as a grievance, the hardship of calling constables from the back settlements of this Province, to tend upon Courts in Charlestown.

III. We present as a very great grievance, the want of a publick Goal, as the present is quite insufficient to answer the end proposed.

IV. We present as a very great grievance, which calls loudly for redress, the want of a digest of the several Acts of Assembly of this Province ; and also a printed edition of them all in regular order, and under proper titles, with an accurate and copious index; for want of both which, his Majesty’s subjects in genera] are very ignorant of the local laws.

V. We present the great neglect of the Blilitialaw, the people in the country not mustering often ; we also complain of the neglect of not carrying arms to church and other places of worship; and against the bad custom of delivering their arms to negroes or other slaves, to keep while they are at divine service.

VI. We present as a grievance, the want of a law to oblige the inhabitants of Charlestown to carry arms to church on Sundays, or other places of worship.

VII. We present as a general grievance through the Province, the want of a patrol duty being duly done, and submit it to the Legislature whether a provincial or parochial tax to support the expense of a standing patrol, to be constantly on duty, would not better answer the intentions of apprehending fugitive slaves; and that all fugitives after so many months absence should be deemed outlaws, and subject to death without sentence or expense to the Province.

VIII. We present it as a grievance, the too frequent abuse of the law relative to the keeping a proper number of white men on plantations, according to the number of blacks.

IX. We present as a grievance the too frequent liberty given to negroes in the country to make use of fire arms.

X. We present that the negro law is not put into strict execution, and that the slaves in Charlestown are not under a good regulation, and that they at all times in the night go about the streets rioting, that they do often gather in great numbers on the sabbath day and make riots, where it is not in the power of the small number of watchmen to suppress them, which we fear may, without any precaution, prove of the utmost ill consequence to this Province.

XI. We present it as a grievance, the want of a proper house of correction in Charlestown; the work-house, now used for that purpose, being insufficient, whereby notorious bawds, strumpets, vagrants, drunkards, or idle persons, who might be there committed, reign and infest the said town with impunity.

XII. We present it as a grievance, the number of licensed tippling and other houses in Charlestown, selling spirituous liquors to sailors and negroes, which is productive of many evils, such as receiving stolen goods.

XIII. We present as a grievance the want of a new jury list, as the publick duty falls tod often on the same persons in Charlestown and elsewhere.

XIV. We present it as a great grievance, the want of a law to regulate the rates of wharfage in Charlestown, as well as the scales and weights on the said wharfs; for want of which many unreasonable exactions and impositions are sustained by the trading and planting interest in this Province; the charges on

756

NOTES.

wharfage of many articles being greatly increased within these few yeais past, and, unless limited by a law, it is apprehended, will grow to an intolerable height of extravagance, and greatly oppressive to trade.

XV. We present it as a grievance, the want of a proper officer, whose whole business it shall be, to see that the fire-wood sold in Charlestown, be duly measured, and to prevent forestalling the same to the great detriment of the poor.

XVI. We present as a very great grievance, the great number of counterfeit public orders that are frequently passed in the back parts of this Province, to the great detriment of the poor inhabitants, who frequently take such bills as good, and give in exchange gold and silver for them ; and we would beg leave to recommend to the legislature, that in future marbled paper may be sent for to be used when any public orders or bills are to be issued by the public.

XVII. We present it as a great prievauce, that part of the highway, commonly called Ashley river road, leading from the plantation of Mr. William Elliott to the Old Quarter-house, and also that part of the road leading into Goose Creek parish, as far as the plantation of Mr. John Ernest Poyass, being totally neglected for many years past, the same being almost obstructed with trees and shrubs, growing within the limits of the said road.

XVIII. We present Simon Long, in Colleton Square, for keeping a disorderly house, and selling liquors to negroes (by the information of George Noddings.)

XIX. We present Daniel Gullet, of Indian creek, Berkley county, for harbouring horse-stealers and other villains (by the information of Isaeliar Wilcox of same place.

XX. We present Abraham Gin and Martha Hunter, on Broad river, Craven county, for living in adultery (by the information of Bartholomew Austin, constable.)

XXI. We present Dr. Cholmondeley Dering and Margaret Duthy for living together in Charlestown, in an unlawful manner, and having a bastard child (by the information of James Skirving, Esq.)

XXII. We present Messrs. Morton Wilkinson, Thomas Shann, and James Gilchrist Simpson, commissioners of Wallace’s causeway, in St. Paul’s parish, for not keeping it in proper order (by the information of Benjamin Elliott, Esq.)

XXIII. We present Messrs. Thomas Mitchell, Paul Trapicr, Elias Horry, George Gabriel Powell, William Jamieson, Joseph Allston, and Josiah Allston, commissioners for Lynch’s causeway, Craven county, for not keeping the bridges and slip in proper order (by the information of Francis Ivinloek, Esq.)

XXIV. We present Messrs. Daniel Blake, William Sanders, James Sanders, Michael Geiger, John loor, jun. William Ioor, James Smith, Stephen (later, Burnaby Branford, John Ainslie, and John Waring, commissioners of the high roads in St. George’s parish, Dorchester, for their neglect of the roads at a place called The Cypress and places adjacent, it being impassable for carriages (by information of Tacitus Gaillard, Esq.)

XXV. We present as a very great grievance to this Province, that too little regard has frequently been paid to the presentments of the Grand Jurors.

XXVI. We beg leave to recommend to his honour the Chief Justice, that the foregoing presentments be printed in full in both the Gazettes.

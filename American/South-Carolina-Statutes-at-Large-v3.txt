I. Be it therefore enactedhy his Excellency John Lord Cartaret, Palatine,

and the rest of the true and absolute Lords and Proprietors of this Pro- ^an1^1”11610 vince of Carolina, by and with the advice and consent of the rest of the repealed, members of the General Assembly, now met at Charlestown for the south and west part of the said Province, and by the authority of the same, That the aforesaid recited clause in the said Act is hereby declared repealed, annulled and made void, to all intents and purposes whatsoever.

II. And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the inhabitants

and owners of lands in Charlestown, shall have full and free liberty to built^of Tvood° build on their said lands any manner of buildings, and of what materials provided the ’ they shall think fitting-, whether it be of bricks, wood or wooden frames, hearths and

j , , 7 cmmniesarc or

as shall suit best with their conveniency. Provided nevertheless, That brickorstone. all manner of chimnies, hearths and fire-places, shall continue to be built of brick or stone, within the limits aforesaid, by the persons that shall erect any such building as above mentioned, under the penalty of fifty pounds, current money of this Province, to be forfeited by such person who builds with any other materials, and they are hereby declared to be a common nusance, and the commissioners in the aforesaid recited Act, are hereby impowered to pull down and demolish the same.

III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the penalty in the last clause above mentioned shall be recovered by action of Penalty how to debt, bill, plaint or information, in any court of record in this Province,je recovered-wherein no essoign, privilege, injunction or wager of law shall be admitted

IV. Whereas, by one other Act of Assembly of this Province, entituled an Act for reviving and continuing the several Acts therein mentioned, which are expired or near expiring, ratified in open Assembly the thirtieth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and sixteen, amongst other things therein declared, it is enacted that one Act entituled an Act for settling a Salary on the publick Receiver, ratified in open Assembly the first day of March, one thousand seven hundred and ten-eleven, is thereby declared revived, continued, and enacted to be of full force, for and during and until the full term and time of two years after the ratification of the said Act, and from thence to the end of the first session of the General Assembly, and no longer; which said Act, for settling a salary on the publick Receiver, happened to be inserted thus among the temporary laws by some inadvertency or mistake, the same being an Act without limitation, as reference being thereunto had may more fully and at large appear; but to clear all doubts that may hereafter happen to arise about the true intent and meaning of the above recited clause, Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the said Act, for settling a salary on the publick Receiver, is hereby declared to be of full force and virtue until repealed by an Act of the General Assembly; any limitation therein contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

V. A?id whereas there appears, by the records of this Province, two Acts for the settling of Pilotage to be at this time both in force, though they contain downright contradictions one to the other, which may occasion debates and controversys ; for preventing the same, Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that one Act of Assembly of this Province, entituled an Act for the settling Pilotage, ratified in open Assembly the twelfth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seven, and since that time continued by several Acts to the month of December which will be in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, is hereby declared repealed, annulled and made void, to all intents and purposes whatsoever, any limitation in any Act now in force concerning the same notwithstanding.

VI. And whereas one other Act of Assembly of this Province, entituled an Act to encourage the importation of White Servants into this Province, ratified in open Assembly the thirteenth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and sixteen, is so far from answering the good intentions thereby designed, that it has proved the chiefest discouragement for the importation of white servants, and is in many respects impracticable and prejudicial to the Province; Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the said Act, and every clause, paragraph, matter and thing therein contained, is hereby declared repealed, annulled and utterly made void, and of none effect; any limitation therein contained to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

To the Governour and Council of South Carolina, for the time being!

HIS Majesty having been pleased by his order in Council bearing date the 14th of May, 171S, to signify his royal pleasure to us the Lord Palatine and the rest of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of South Carolina, that we should forthwith Repeal an Act they passed in that Province, of pernicious consequence to trade and repugnant to the laws and customs of Great Britain, wherein a duty is laid of ten pounds per cent, upon all goods of British manufactory imported into that Province from Great Britain : We, therefore, the Lord Palatine and the rest of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, in obedience to his Majesty’s commands, repeal the said Act, and we hereby do declare the said Act laying a duty of ten pounds per cent, upon all goods of British manufactory imported into that Province from Great Britain, and all matters therein contained, to be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever.

We having also taken into our consideration, an Act, entituled, an Act declaring the right of the House of Commons for the time being, to nominate the Publick Receiver, &c. and finding the said Act to be inconsistent with the safety, welfare and good government of the Province of South Garolina, and inconsistent with and contrary to the usage and custom of

We likewise have read and considered two Acts of Assembly, the one entituled an Act to keep inviolate and preserve the freedom of elections, and appoint who shall be deemed and adjudged capable of chasing or being chosen members of the Commons House of Assembly, the other entituled an additional and explanatory Act to the foregoing Act, and finding the said two Acts tend to the entire alteration and subversion of the Constitution of the Province of South Carolina, and are contrary to the laws and customs of Parliament in Great Britain, we therefore do declare the said two last mentioned Acts to be null and void, and we do hereby repeal, nullifie and make void the said two Acts, and every clause, matter or thing therein contained whatsoever.

We have read also two other Acts of Assembly, the titles of which arc an Act to appropriate the Yamasee lands to the use of such persons as shall come into and settle themselves in this Province, and to such other persons qualified as therein mentioned, and an Act to grant several privi-ledges, exemptions and encouragements to such of his Majesty’s Protestant subjects as are desirous to come into and settle in this Province, which two Acts being an encroachment upon the property of us the Lords Proprietors, and tend only to the disposal of our estates, to which the Assembly can pretend no manner of right, we therefore do declare the said two Acts to be null and void, and we do hereby repeal, annul and make void the said two Acts, and every matter or thing therein contained, to all intents and purposes whatsoever.

We having received a petition from Mr. Joseph Boon, Mr. Stephen Godin, Mr. Samuel Barons, and several other merchants of London, complaining of the Indian trade Act as a monopoly, viz : the carrying on a trade by a Company exclusive of all others; and his Majesty having been graciously pleased, upon application made to him by the merchants of London, to repeal the law made in Virginia to the same efi'ect, we the Lord Palatine and the rest of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of South Carolina, do think it proper to repeal and make void the said Indian Trade Act, and it is hereby repealed, annulled and made void, to all intents and purposes whatsoever.

WE think it highly unreasonable and unjust, that in matters relating to The Lords trade, any difference or distinction should be made between his Majesty’s Proprietors subjects tesiding in Great Britain and those that live in our Province South Carolina, or that any greater duty should be imposed on ships built Act. in Great Britain than on ships built in Carolina; wherefore we the Lord Palatine and the rest of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of South Carolina in America, do think it proper to repeal and make void an Act of Assembly entituled an additional Act to an Act entituled an Act for laying an imposition on liquors, goods and merchandizes, &c. and we do hereby declare the said Act, and all matters and things therein contained, to be repealed, made null and void, to all intents and purposes whatsoever.

Given under our hands and the great, seal of our Province of Carolina, the day and date first above written.

XVI.

STONED BY NOT DRAWING TIIE JURIES, WHICH ARE TO SERVE AT THE

NEXT ENSUING CoURT OF COMMON PlEAS, GENERAL SESSIONS OF THE

Peace, Oyer and Terminer, Assize and General Gaol Delivery,

ON THE DAYS APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE, AND FOR THE REGULATING OF THE SEVERAL COURTS THEREIN MENTIONED.

WHEREAS, in and by an Act of General Assembly of this Province, entitled an Act for confirming and establishing the ancient and approved method of drawing Juries by ballot, among other things it is enacted, and the method and particular times of drawing juries to serve at the Courts of Common Pleas, General Sessions of the Peace, Oyer and Terminer,

Assize and General Goal Delivery, in this Province, are therein particularly directed ; and whereas, the juries to serve at the next ensuing Court of Common Pleas, General Sessions of the Peace, Oyer and Terminer,

Assize and General Goal Delivery, were drawn in open court, during the sitting thereof, in all respects according to the tenour and direction of the said Act of Assembly (the times only excepted); to help which defects, and prevent any delay of justice that may be occasioned thereby," we therefore pray your most sacied Majesty that it may be enacted,

I. And be it enacted by hi3 Excellency Robert Johnson, Esq. , Governour,

Captain General and Commander-in-chief in and over his Majesty’s Province of South Carolina, by and with the advice and consent of his Majesty’s honourable Council, and the Assembly of this Province, and by the authority of the same, That the juries drawn in open court, as aforesaid, to serve at the next ensuing Court of Common Pleas, General Sessions of the Peace,

Oyer and Terminer, Assize and General Goal Delivery, during the sitting of the Court of Common Pleas, held at Charlestown, in November last, shall and may be deemed, held and taken to be good and lawful juries, for trying, hearing and determining all causes which shall come before them, to be heard, tryed and determined at the ensuing Court of Common Pleas, to be holden this February instant; and for trying, hearing and determining all criminal causes that shall come before them to be tryed, heard and determined, at the ensuing General Sessions of the Peace,

Oyer and Terminer, Assize and General Goal Delivery, to be held at Charlestown, the third Wednesday in March next ensuing.

II. And it is hereby enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the several juries drawn in court, as aforesaid, shall beheld, deemed and taken to be good and lawful juries, for the purposes aforesaid : and that the said jurors, so drawn and summoned, according to the tenour of the said Act, shall be liable to the same forfeitures and penalties, in case of neglect or refusal to appear, as are mentioned in the aforesaid Act; any thing in this, or the said Jury Act, contained to the contiary thereof in any wise notwithstanding : Provided nevertheless, that this Act, nor any thing therein contained, shall extend, or be taken to extend, to change or alter any clause, matter or thing in the aforesaid Jury Act contained.

III. And for preventing the like inconveniencies for the future, Be it further enacted, That the jurors required by the said recited Act of Assembly to serve the Court of Common Pleas, shall hereafter be drawn by ballot, in open court, pursuant to the directions of the same, on the first, second or third days of the sitting of the Court of Common Pleas, preceding that for which they shall be summoned to serve at; except the

324

STATUTES AT LARGE

A. D 1131. juries to serve at the next May court, which may be drawn at any time within ten days next after the ratification of thi3 Act; anything in the said recited Act to the contrary thereof contained in any wise notwithstanding.

IV. And whereas, his Majesty’s subjects in this Province who have been obliged to serve on juries, have been long detained in Charlestown, by the frequent and unnecessary adjournments of the Court of Common Pleas, to their great charge, expence, trouble and vexation; for the prevention of the like grievances for the future. Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the said Court of Common Pleas, which hath been for many years last past holden on the second Tuesdays in the months of February, May, August and November, in every year, shall, at all times hereafter, be holden on the same days and times; and the judges and justices of the said court, and all other persons whose attendance are required at the said court, shall sit and meet on the said days respectively, and shall forthwith proceed to do business, and shall diligently attend and sit de die in diem until all business that is proper for the inquiry of a jury is dispatched and finished ; and when such business is finished, and the jury discharged, it shall and may be lawful for the Judge or Justices of the said Court of Common Pleas to adjourn the said court for any time not exceeding twenty days, nor less than ten days ; and when the said court shall meet, after the said adjournment, the said judge or justices shall sit for three days, de die in diem, and no longer, to hear and determine all matters of law, and other matters proper for the cognizance of the said court, and not triable or examinable by a jury ; and on the last of the said three days, the said justices shall adjourn the said court over to the next sitting in course, on such of the aforesaid Tuesdays in February, May, August and November, as shall then next ensue. And the said Judge or Justices of the said Court of Common Pleas, are hereby required and enjoyned to proceed in and hear and determine all causes and matters in the said court that shall come before them, and are proper for their cognizance and jurisdiction, according to the ancient rules and practice of the said court, used, settled and approved, for many years past; and that no alteration, innovation or change shall be made in the rules and practice of the said court, unless it be by the authority of the General Assembly, and by no other authority whatsoever within this Province.

V. And whereas, by the laws now in being, the times appointed for solemn and final heatings in his Majesty’s Court of Chancery in this Province, are fixed and confined to the first Thursday after the sitting of the Court of Common Pleas, in every second Tuesday in the months of February, May, August and November, in every year, at which times the said Court of Chancery is obliged to sit de die in diem till all business is dispatched, which method hath been found to be attended with many inconveniencies, for that the said court very often interferes with the sitting of the General Assembly, and is an interruption to the publick affairs of this Province, from which his Excellency the Governour and the members of his Majesty’s honourable Council are withdrawn, to attend the sitting of the court, and many of the suitors in the said court are often at the same time obliged to attend the Court of Common Pleas, which usually continues to sit during the same week, and becomes a great burthen to the subject, and tends to the delay and hindrance of the administration of publick justice ; and whereas, by the nature and constitution of the Court of Chancery, the said court ought always to be open, that the subject may have constant access and speedy justice administered; Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the said Court of Chancery shall be always open, and as often as any cause or causes are prepared and

made fit for hearing, it shall and may be lawful for his Excellency the A.D. 1731.

Governour, or the Commander-in-chief of this Province for the time being,

to appoint a time for holding a Court of Chancery, to hear and determine

such cause or causes, and shall order the members of his Majesty’s Council

to be summoned to attend at the time so appointed ; and when any court

shall be met and assembled, according to such summons, they may adjourn

de die in diem till such cause or causes are heard or determined ; and if the

said causes cannot be determined at such time, they may adjourn to any

further day, as the nature of the case may require; any former law, usage

or custom to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding : Provided always,

that there shall be at least fifteen days publick notice given of the sitting

of the said court, which notice shall be given by the register of the said

court, by affixing the same, with the names of the causes to be heard, at

the publick watch-house in Charlestown ; provided also, that a Court of

Chancery shall always be held at least once in every three months in the

year, if there shall be any causes depending, prepared for hearing in the

said court.

VI. And whereas, the Court of Common Pleas appointed by law to be holden at Charlestown the second Tuesday in February instant, could not then be holden and kept, by reason of the badness of the weather, and the great distance the Chief Justice of this Province lives from Charlestown, there, being no assistant Justices appointed for the said Court of Common Pleas, who otherwise might have adjourned the said court de die in diem until the coming of the said Chief Justice; by reason of which disappointment of holding the said court on the said second Tuesday in February instant, all causes and proceedings thereon in the said court are discontinued, for which, if due provision be not made, great delay of justice and consequently great expences to the suitors in the said court will ensue : Therefore, for the continuing and reviving all manner of actions or pleas lately depending in the said court, and which were discontinued or said to be discontinued and put without day by not holding the said court,

Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all pleas, writs, bills, actions, suits, plaints, process, precepts, or other things whatsoever, that were returnable, or had day or days in the said Court of Common Pleas, on the said second Tuesday in February instant, or at any day or days certain, after the said return, shall stand, continue and be revived, to all intents and purposes, and are hereby continued and adjourned unto, and shall and may be pleaded, heard and proceeded upon at the Court of Common Pleas, to be holden at Charlestown, on Thursday the second day of March next ensuing ; and that all parties that had day, by any pleas, writs, bills, actions, suits, plaints, process, precepts, or other thing or things whatsoever, at or in the said second Tuesday in February, or at any other day or days certain, after the said return, shall appear in the said court, at and on the said second day of March next ensuing, under the penalty of forfeiting any obligations or recognizances, conditioned for the appearing of the said parties at the said return, on the second Tuesday in February instant, or under any other penalties that might have incurred upon the said parties, their pledges and sureties, for not appearing at the said return on the said second Tuesday in February, if the said Couit of Common Pleas,had been then holden or kept; any discontinuance or miscontinuance, or any law, usage or custom to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

VII. And for the prevention of any such inconvenience for the future,

Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that there shall be nominated and appointed two or more assistant judges or justices of the said Court of Common Pleas, to be commissioned for that purpose by his Majesty, his

Carolina, or elsewhere (except what was therein before and thereinafter devised) when he the said John Beresford should attain unto the age of one-and-twenty years ; and the said Richard Beresford therein and thereby declared, that his will was that his said son John Beresford, should have all due and liberal education, maintenance and subsistance out of the yearly profits and produce of all his real and personal estate therein before mentioned to be devised to his said son, according to the direction of his executor thereinafter named, until his said son should attain the age of one-and-twenty years ; and the said testator did further give, devise and bequeath unto the honourable Colonel Thomas Broughton, thereinafter appointed his executor, the sum of ten pounds per centum per annum, for every one hundred pounds he should make of the clear yearly profits and produce of the real and personal estate devised to his said son, for the said Colonel Broughton’s care and management thereof, until his the said testator’s son should arrive to the age of one-and-twenty; and the said testator did, by his said will, further give; devise and bequeath unto the said Colonel Thomas Broughton, his executors and administrators, all the rest, residue and remainder of the yearly profits and produce of his said real and personal estate not therein before devised, until his said son should attain to his age of one-and-twenty years, upon special trust and confidence, and for the several uses, intents and purposes hereinafter mentioned, that is to say, upon trust that he the said Colonel Thomas Broughton, should yearly and every year, pay the same into the hands of the vestry, for the time being, of the parish of St. Thomas, in Berkley county, to be disposed of by the said vestry, or the major part of

AN ADDITIONAL axd Explanatory Act to an Act for advan- No. 631. / cing the Salaries of the Clergy, and for a further, more

EQUAL AND EFFECTUAL PROVISION FOR THE RELIEF OF THE POOR.

WHEREAS, by an Act of the General Assembly of this Province, passed on the 23d day of June, 1722, entitled an Act for advancing the Preamble, salaries of the Clergy, it is amongst other things enacted, that the churchwardens and any five of the vestry-men of each parish within this Province, shall and they are thereby fully empowered, to rate and assess all the taxable inhabitants of each parish respectively, toward the maintenance of all and every the poor within the same parish, who have resided in any such parish for the space of twelve months then last past, and that rateably and proport ion ably to the general tax or assessment for the year precedent, and shall levy the same by warrant of distress under the hands and seals of the two church-wardens and five of the said vestry-men against the goods of the said person so refusing to pay the same, and shall make sale thereof, returning the overplus after deducting thereout reasonable charges for the levying the monies so assessed, as in and by the said Act, relation being thereunto had, more fully appears : And whereas, upon the general

words of the said recited Act, it has been conceived by some that the rate and assessment by the said Act directed to be made for and towards maintaining of the poor of the several and respective parishes in this Province, ought in proportion to the general tax to be rated and assessed upon the inhabitants, as well for the estates real and personal, lying and being within the respective parishes, for the maintenance of whose poor the said rates and assessments are respectively made, as for such their estates as are lying and being in other parts of this Province, without the limits of the same parish : Now, for the prevention of all doubts, ques-

tions and disputes for the future, concerning the manner of making such rates and assessments for the maintenance of the poor of the several and respective parishes in this Province,

1. Be it enacted, That the church-wardens and any five vestry-men, who, by the herein before recited Act, are authorized and empowered to

rate and assess die inhabitants of each respective palish in this Province, towards the maintenance of the poor of the same parish, shall in all rales and assessments hereafter to be made in pursuance of the said recited Act, only rate and assess the said inhabitants in proportion to the general tax paid or to be paid in the preceding year for such part of their estates real and personal, as shall or may be situate, lying or being in the parish for the maintenance of whose poor such rate and assessment shall be made : Provided, that all and singular the estates real and personal, of

every person and persons whatsoever, which shall or may be rated and assessed in the general tax, shall be also rated and assessed by the churchwardens and any five of the vestrymen, in each respective parish where such estate, real or personal, shall be situate, lying or being, for and towards the relief-and maintenance of the poor of every such parish respectively; and the sums which shall be so rated and assessed for and towards the relief and maintenance of the poor of each respective parish, shall be levied and recovered from the owners, possessors or occupiers of such estates, real or personal, or from their attornies, agents, managers or trustees, in the like manner and form as is directed by the before recited Act; any former law, statute, custom or usage, to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

STATUTES AT LARGE

A.D. 1744. ever passed in this Province, great quantitys of lands were granted to the inhabitants of this Province, but the conditions inserted in such grants to oblige the grantees to cultivate and improve the same, have not proved effectual for the settlement of this Province, because although those conditions have not been complied with by many persons, yet his Majesty’s Governor and Council have not been able to resume such lands, or to accept a surrender of them in behalf of his Majesty, that so those lands might be granted to other persons ; and whereas, a great part of the lands so granted as aforesaid are still uncultivated, and in all likelihood will so remain for many years to come, unless this country shall be strengthened by an increase of people : And whereas, there are many persons who

have obtained such grants as aforesaid, or hold under them, are sensible of the great dangers to which this Province is exposed by the lands being so thinly settled, and of the inconveniencys and prejudice that has arisen from the same, and are willing to surrender and yield up to his Majesty all the right they have to the lands which they hold or claimed under such grants, for the use of such industrious poor protestants and others, who are willing to become settlers, and to improve and cultivate such lands; wherefore, as well for the better receiving and collecting his Majesty’s quit rents, which are reserved upon such grants, and which are or shall be due and in arrear, and for increasing the same in time to come, as for strengthening this Province by giving due encouragement to poor protes-testants and others to come and settle here, Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That after the allowance, confirmation and final ratifi-Lands may Bs- cation of this Act by his Majesty, his heirs or successors, and after the surrendered on publication of the same in this Province, it shall and may be lawful for quf™ems°f any person or persons whosoever, who now do or hereafter may hold any lands, tenements or hereditaments by any grantor grants from his Majesty, his heirs or successors, or by any right or title derived under such grant or grants, to yield up and surrender the same grant or giants, and all the lands mentioned or described in such grant or grants, and all their title, claim and demand to all such lands, tenements or hereditaments, unto his Majesty, his heirs or successors, such person or persons first fully satisfying and paying to his Majesty, his heirs, or successors, or to his or their receiver general, or to such other person as by him or them shall be appointed to receive the same, all such quit rents as shall or may be reserved on such grant or grants, and which shall be in arrear, due, owing or unpaid at the lime of making such surrender ; and it shall and may be lawful for the Governor or Commander-in-chief of this Province for the time being, by and with the advice and consent of his Majesty’s honorable Council, to accept and receive such surrender on his Majesty’s behalf, and shall cause the same to be certified to his Majesty’s receiver and auditor *' general, or their deputy or deputys, residing in this Province ; and after such surrender shall be made, accepted and received as aforesaid, such grantees as aforesaid and their heirs, and all and every person and persons claiming under them, or any of them, shall be forever thereafter freed and discharged from the payment of the quit rents reserved on such grants, and the lands, tenements and hereditaments described and contained in such grants, shall and may be again granted by his Majesty, his heirs or successors, for the use of such industrious poor protestants or others who may be willing to come over to this Province, and shall be desirous to improve and cultivate the same, and for no other use or purpose whatsoever.

VIII. And whereas, notwithstanding the good and wholesome laws heretofore made in this Province to prevent irregularitys being committed by the surveyor general in his office, or by any of his deputys, several deputy surveyors for the sake of unjust gain have made it a practice to make, certify and return several plats to different persons of the same land, and have also returned plats with feigned and false descriptions, which were not to be found on the lands delineated and . represented, by reason whereof several of his Majesty’s subjects have been put to considerable charges and expences in obtaining grants for such lands, and have been made chargeable in his Majesty’s rent roll for quit rents of lands supposed to have been laid out for them, and have been otherwise much grieved and damaged by the fraudulent practices of such deputy surveyors ; for remedy whereof, Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,

That whenever such frauds shall be discovered and due proof shall be made of the same before the Governour or Commander-in-chief of this Province for the time being, and his Majesty’s honorable Council, the party or partys so deceived shall be relieved, and may be at liberty to yield up and surrender any grant or grants which shall appear to have been certifyed and returned by any deputy surveyor in such fraudulent manner as aforesaid; and the Governour or Commander-in-chief of this Province for the time being, by and with the advice and consent of his Majesty’s honorable Council, shall cause the matter to be certified to his Majesty’s receiver and auditor general, or their deputys residing hese, and the party or partys so grieved as aforesaid, and their heirs, shall be freed and forever discharged from the quit rents reserved on the grants passed upon such fraudulent return as aforesaid.

WHEREAS, the Acts heretofore made in this Province for the relief and discharge of poor, distressed, and insolvent prisoners for debt, have been liable to such great and notorious abuses, as have in a great measure obstructed the good ends and purposes of such Acts, and many idle and extravagant persons have, thereby, been encouraged to contract many debts beyond their capacity of ever paying, and others to submit themselves to a prison, and there spend what would make their creditors reasonable satisfaction ; and whereas, there may be many others who are proper objects of compassion, and may be willing to satisfy their creditors as far as they are able ; for preventing the like abuses, and for the ease and relief of such prisoners as shall be willing to satisfy their creditors as far as they are able, we humbly pray his most sacred Majesty that it may be enacted,

. 4. V ACT FOR REDUCING OF INTEREST FROM Ten TO ElGIIT BY THE A'0. 764.

Hundred.

WHEREAS, in and by an Act of Parliament of England, intitled an Act against usury, made in the thirteenth year of the late Lady Elizabeth, Preamble reci-Queen of England, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, and so ting former forth, and in the year of our Lord one thousand five hundred and seventy,Act3, it was enacted and declared, that forasmuch as all usury being forbidden by the law of God, is sin and detestible, therefore all bonds, contracts and assurances, made for payment of money lent upon, or by which there should be received or taken above the rate of ten pounds for the hundred for one year, should be utterly void, and the offenders therein should be moreover punished according to the ecclesiastical laws made against usury : And whereas, in and by another Act of Parliament of England,

made the twenty-first year of the reign of our late sovereign Lord, King James the first, and in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred and twenty-three, intitled an Act against usury, in the preamble thereof reciting, that whereas, at the time of passing the said Act, there was a very great abatement in the value of land, and the merchandizes, wares and commoditys of the kingdom, and that whereas divers subjects of the kingdom, as well the gentry as merchants, farmers and tradesmen, both for their urgent and necessary occasions for the following their trades, maintenance of their stocks and employments, have borrowed and do borrow divers sums of money, wares, merchandizes, and other commoditys, but by reason of the said general fall and abatement of the value of land, and the prices of the said merchandizes, wares and commoditys, and interest on loan continuing at so high a rate as ten pounds in the hundred pounds for a year, did not only make men unable to pay their debts and continue the maintenance of their trade, but their debts daily increasing, they were enforced to sell their lands and stocks at very low rates, to forsake the use of merchandize and trade, and to give over their leases and farms, and so become unprofitable members of the commonwealth, to the great hurt and hindrance of the same, it was enacted that the rate of interest upon all contracts made after the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand six hundred and twenty-five, should be reduced from ten to eight by the hundred, under the forfeiture of treble the value of the money, goods, wares or merchandizes lent, whereon more than eight by the hundred should be taken or reserved ; and in and by the said Act, it was provided that no words I herein should be construed or expounded to allow the practice of usury, in point of religion or conscience : And whereas, in and by one other Act of the Parliament of England, made in

710

STATUTES AT LARGE

A.D. 1748. the twelfth year of the reign of our late sovereign Lord, King Charles the second, and in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred and sixty, reciting in the preamble thereof, that forasmuch as the abatement of interest from ten in the hundred in former times, had been found by notable experience beneficial to the advancement of trade and improvement of lands by good husbandry, with many other considerable advantages to the nation, and further reciting, that in fresh memory the like fall from ei^ht to six in the hundred by a late constant practice, had found the like success, to the general contentment of the nation, as was visible by several improvements; and that whereas it was then the endeavour of some persons to reduce it back again in practice, to the allowance of the statute then still in force, to eight in the hundred, to the great discouragement of ingenuity and industry in the husbandry, trade and commerce of the nation ; it was thereby enacted, that no person or persons, from and after the twenty-ninth day of September, one thousand six hundred and sixty, upon any contract, should from and after the said twenty-ninth day of September, take, directly or indirectly, for the loan of any moneys, wares, merchandizes or other commoditys whatsoever, above the value of six pounds, for the forbearance of one hundred pounds for a year, under the forfeiture of treble the value of the moneys, wares, merchandizes and other things lent as aforesaid : And whereas, in and by one other Act of

the parliament of Great Britain, made in the twelfth year of our late sovereign Lady Queen Ann, and in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and fourteen, intitled an Act to reduce the rate of interest without any prejudice to parliamentary securitys, reciting in the preamble, that whereas, the reducing of interest to ten, and from thence to eight, and from thence to six in the hundred, had from time to time, by experience, been found very beneficial to the advancement of trade and improvement of lands: And that whereas, the heavy burthen of the late long and

expensive war, had been chiefly borne by the owners of the land of that kingdom, by reason whereof they had been necessitated to contract very-large debts, and thereby, and by the abatement of the value of their lands, were become greatly impoverished ; and that by reason of the great interest and profit which had been made of money at home, the foreign trade of the nation had been much neglected: And that whereas, there was at

that time a great abatement in the value of the merchandizes, wares and commoditys of the kingdom, and that for redress of these mischiefs, it was become absolutely necessary to reduce the high rate of interest of six pounds in the hundred pounds for a year, to a nearer proportion with the interest allowed for money in foreign states, it was thereby enacted that no person or persons whatsoever, from and after the twenty-ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and fourteen, upon any contract which should be made from and after the said day, should take, directly or indirectly, for loan of any moneys, wares, merchandizes or other commoditys whatsoever, above the value of five pounds, for the forbearance of one hundred pounds for one year, under the penalty of forfeiting treble the value of the money or other the commoditys so lent: And whereas, the rate of interest in most of the British

colonys and plantations in America, after the example of our mother country, hath been reduced by several of the Acts of the General Assem-blys of the Provinces, under ten in the hundred : And whereas, by reason-

of the present war with France and Spain, the price of the staple commoditys of this Province are become greatly lessened and sunk in their value, and many of the inhabitants of this Province by reason thereof, and of the abatement of the value of their lands, plantations, slaves and stocks,

and the excessive rates and prices demanded ami taken for goods, wares A.D. 1748. and merchandizes imported into this Province, and the interest of money ' continuing in this Province so excessively high as ten in the hundred for one year, are become greatly impoverished'; for redress whereof for the future, we humbly pray his most sacred Majesty that it may be enacted,

I. And be it enacted, by his Excellency James Glen, Esquire, Captain General and Governor in chief in and over his Majesty’s Province of South Carolina, by and with the advice and consent of his Majesty’s honorable Council, and the Commons House of Assembly of this Province, and

by the authority of the same, That no person or persons whatsoever, from Interestre-and after the twenty-ninth day of September, which will be in the year o^ent^er Per our Lord one thousand seven hundred and forty-eight, upon any contract annum, which shall be made, from and after the said twenty-ninth day of September, shall take, directly or indirectly, for loan of any moneys, wares, merchandizes or other commoditys whatsoever, above the value of eight pounds, for the forbearance of one hundred pounds for one year, and so after that rate for a greater or lesser sum, or for a longer or shorter time, and so

according to that rate and proportion for goods, wares or commoditys lent, to be repaid again in goods, wares or commoditys, or in moneys; and that all bunds, specialitys, contracts, promises and assurances whatsoever, made after the time aforesaid, for payment of any principal or money, or goods, wares or commoditys as aforesaid, to be lent, or covenanted to be performed, upon or for any usury, whereupon or whereby there shall be reserved or taken above the rate of eight pounds in the hundred, as aforesaid, and so according to that rate and proportion, if goods, wares and merchandizes or commoditys are lent as aforesaid, shall be utterly void and of none effect: And that all and every person and persons whatsoever, who after

the time aforesaid, upon any contract to be made after the said twenty-Penalty of ninth day of September, shall take, accept or receive, by way or means oflJ^n^e any corrupt bargain, loan, exchange, shift or interestof any moneys, wares, merchandizes, commoditys or other thing or things whatsoever, or by any deceitful way or means, for the forbearing or giving day of payment for one whole year, of or for their money or other thing, above the sum of eight pounds for the forbearing of one hundred pounds for one year, and so after that rate for a greater or lesser sum, or for a longer or shorter time, or so after that rate or proportion for other goods, wares or commoditys, where such shall be lent, contracted or agreed for, taken, accepted or received, shall forfeit and lose for every such offence, the treble value of the moneys, wares, merchandizes, commoditys or other things so lent, bargained, exchanged, shifted or taken ; the one half of which forfeiture shall be to his Majesty, for the use of the public treasury of this Province, and the other half to him or them that will infoim and sue for the same, to be recovered with full costs of suit, in any court of record in this Pro* be sue(j for vince, by action of debt, bill, plaint or information, wherein no essoign, within six wager of law or protection shall be allowed : Provided always, that every months,

such action, plaint or information, shall be commenced and sued in the lender’s lifetime, and within six months next after the offence committed, and at no time after.

II. And whereas, it is to be feared that wicked and evil minded persons, for the sake of lucre and unjust gain, will often exact and take greater usury and higher rates of interest from necessitous persons than is allowed by this Act, in hopes that their offence against this Act may not be discovered for want of proof, as such transactions will generally be carried on when only the borrower and lender are present together; for remedy whereof, and preventing or punishing as much as possible all usurious

discharged against the demands of such creditors as shall be willing to A.D. 1750. receive a dividend of the said petitioner’s assigned estate, agreeable to the said Acts: And whereas, many creditors of the person so sued and petitioning for his or her discharge, may not be inclined to accept a dividend of such petitioner’s estate, but will rather wait in hopes of receiving some fuller satisfaction from the said petitioner’s future better fortune; but inasmuch as the said creditors, by note, book account or contract, who through indulgence or better expectation may delay their suits against such petitioners, may become barred by the Act of limitations of this Province; we therefore pray his most sacred Majesty that it may be enacted,

I. And it is hereby accordingly enacted, by His Excellency James Glen,

NOTES TO VOLUME THIRD.

It has been intimated to me by one or two gentlemen of the bar, whose opinions are entitled to respect, that the Notes would be much more conveniently arranged at the end of each Act, than collected in a separate series at the end of the volume. I think so too: the proposed arrangement would have advantages and save trouble in consultation. But a large portion of the present volume was printed off before the adjournment of the last Legislature, and therefore the plan could not have been adopted for the present volume.

But allowing the convenience of the arrangement, I could not adopt it for this and the succeeding volume, but at the hazard of sacrificing accuracy. Until the publication of the laws subsequent to the adoption of the present Constitution of South Carolina, there is no printed collection of them extant. Grimke’s volume of public laws is so mutilated and imperfect — he has omitted so many laws and parts of laws, that it is nearly useless for the purposes of the present publication. 1 have therefore neglected it, and gone through every original manuscript Act now to be found, making to them my own Notes of marginal abridgement. Under these circumstances, I could not be aware of the bearing of the several Acts on each other in this and the succeeding volume, till I had the whole collection under my purview. I did not choose to commit myself to Notes on each Act, composed ami written currente calamo, without the aid of the Acts that were to come after in the same volume. I have therefore, however reluctantly, preferred giving the notes at the end of the volume, that the necessary sources of information might not escape me. — Editor.

Laws settling the rate of interest at which money shall be computed in cases where the parties have not previously settled it themselves, are of manifest utility. As in cases of trusts, executorships, agencies, and the like. But there are grave objections to the policy of usury laws, making it penal to ask and receive a higher rate of interest than the one established by positive law, even where the parties make their mutual contract with their eyes opeu.

1st. Laws should be made to enforce contracts deliberately entered into by the parties, with a full knowledge of their own reasons and motives. Legislators are incompetent to the purpose of making contracts by law, because they caunot know the circumstances under which the parties severally contract with each other.

2nd. Money is really worth more at one time than another; and to one person more than to another. Suppose a sudden contraction of bank issues, and a consequent scarcity in the money market: a merchant pressed for a sum of money for a short time to save his credit: or having a vessel at the wharf on expences for want of a temporaiy supply to send it oft’. Suppose the sudden offer of a good bargain in an article which is indispensible to the borrower. Suppose he can borrow at 8 per cent, and make 20 per cent, of the loan, Sec. Sec.

3rd. If a merchant sends his note into the market to raise a temporary supply, what law can prevent his negotiating it at a higher than legal interest? This is done every day.

4th. All laws increasing the risk of the lender, and of money lent, only add to the expences of the borrower, who always pays them. They are a tax on the unfortunate.

5th. They are unequal in principle. A man has a thousand dollars to spare: he is prohibited from lending it for more than a certain rate of interest. But he may put it in the form of a house and get as much as any body chooses to give him ; or invest it in a Bank or Insurance Company, and get double the interest that the law allows. This is an unwise legal expulsion of money from the money market. Men of adult age and common sense, know their own interest better than any Legislature can tell them. Nor is it fair to impute dishonesty to a transaction voluntarily entered into by the parties, with their eyes open, and fully aware of all the circumstances of the case, which ought to guide them.

6th. Moreover, every one acknowledges that compensation ought to be proportioned to risk. It is so in the case of Bottomry and Respondentia bonds; every Insurance Office insists on it ; the whole business of the stock exchange is founded on this principle, because it is a principle of common sense, strangely counteracted by Usury laws. The prohibition of catching bargains in cases of minors, depends on other considerations, and laws prohibiting them may well be justified ; for in this case there is incompetence of judgement and experience. No infant can contract but for his own manifest benefit, as in case of necessaries.

For all these reasons it should seem, that the less legislatures interfere with the common business concerns of those who ought to know what they are about, the better. The best policy seems to be Cobourg’s “ Let us alone. ”

No. 426. An Act to prohibit the exportation of Provisions, §mc.

Qu. If this be not rather an Act to discourage the raising of provisions: for the farmer has as much right to take advantage of a rise in the demand, as every other producer has. The higher the price, the more abundant will be the next year’s supply. No man will raise a commodity ow which the consumer is allowed to set his own price.

No. 433. An Act for preventing the desertion of Insolvent debtors, §v. This is an Act to deprive settlers of the credit which would otherwise be extended to them. All Acts that interfere with the due course of law between debtor and creditor, arc sure to work against the real interest of the former.

not allow me to assign my reasons at sufficient length. But what can be the objection to condencing ten or a dozen Acts scattered through the book into one comprehensive law ? Such as the Militia Law, the Law relating to Highways, Bridges and Ferries, the Law regulating the management of our coloured population, the regulations pertaining to Charleston, and very many others; directing the incorporation in those laws, of the approved decisions of our Courts on the various subjects. This might be effected as to our Statute Law within the compass of two volumes. True, it will not put au end to litigation; it will not supercede future legislation, because new circumstances are arising in society continually, presenting new questions to be argued and settled. But as in a long settlement of accounts, periodical rests and liquidations become absolutely necessary to prevent inextricable confusion, so periodical summaries of what ought to become permanent legislation, are necessary for settling the lines of fixed law, and furnishing new starting places for harmonious additions hereafter.

Est quoddam prndire tenvs si non datur ultra.

Much has been thus successfully aud beneficially effected in New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia; and South Carolina ought not to be long behind in digesting a Revised Code.

No. 459. An Act for the relief of poor debtors. This is in fact an Insolvent Debtors Act, cognizable before Justices of the Peace. See hereafter the Insolvent Debtors Act of April, 1759.

No. 461. An Act for preventing the desertion of Insolvent Debtors. The policy of this Act is very dubious. Its tendency seems to be to encourage idleness and dishonesty; a carelessness about the obligation of contracts. If a man is really and bona fide unable to perform his contiacts, let him shew it and obtain a regular discharge. The creditors of poor debtors are usually of the poorer class themselves. It is of great moment in society to enforce the habitual punctuality of living up to the contracts which are deliberately entered into.

No. 469. An Act to encourage the making of Hemp. If making hemp be a profitable occupation, it does not require artificial legislative encouragement; if it be not profitable, it is not for the good of the public that money should be wasted in the pursuit. What right lias the legislature to tax the citizens generally, that an unprofitable occupation may become profitable to the pursuer?

No. 486. An Act for settling and regulating the pilotage of this Province. See the Index of the preceding volume under the head Pilots and Pilotage: and the articles Quarantine and Contagious disorders.

No. 521. An Act for the encouragement of the killing and destroying beasts of prey. See Index of the last volume under title Beasts of Prey.

No. 530, and 531, pages 274 and 287. The Jury Acts. See the preceding volume, Index, title Jurors. The words in the 3d and 4th Sections “in ;he presence of the persons hereafter named,” are repealed by the Circuit Court Act of 1769.

Sect. 4. The title of Provost Marshal] abolished by Circuit Court Act of 1769, and that of Sheriff substituted.

Sect. 29. See Constitution of South Carolina, Sect. 36.

Sect. 30. “ The said Court shall always hereafter be holden before the Chief Justice of this Province. ” This is altered by Act of Assembly, 1789, and any one Judge is empowered to hold the Court.

“ The said Court shall sit twice in every year. ” Altered by Circuit Court Act of 1769, and made 3 times in the year. See Act of Assembly, 25 March, 1778, and Act of 1789.

Sect. 43. Copied partly from 7 W. 3, ch. 3, inserted vol. 2, p. 539.

By Act of 27 Eliz. ch. 7, 1585, retained iu Grimke’s first appendix, page 12, (but without any sufficient authority that I can find,) no Juror shall be returned without the addition of his dwelling place, and in every extract of issues against a Juror, his addition shall be put.

And I find that the Act of 6th and 7th Will. 3d, ch. 4, exempting apothecaries (within 7 miles of London, and in the city,) from serving on Juries, is adopted in our Acts of Assembly, that is as to the profession of apothecary.

NOTES.

I have inserted this among the general Acts, because the subject matter is not confined to Charleston.

See Act No. 433, and the note thereto ; -also Act No. 651, as to the small pox ; Act No. 803, p. 771, post; Act of 26 March, 1784, compared with Act of 19 March, 1785; Act of 19 Dec. 1796; Resolution of 19 Dec. 1793, to appoint port physicians. Pamphlet Laws of 1809, p. 47.

No. 779, p. 724. See notes to the Insolvent Debtors Act of 1759.

No. 784. An Act for the prevention and suppression of private Lotteries.

See Act of 13 Sep. 1762; Act of 17 Dec. 1794, and Pamphlet Laws for 1809, p. 51, establishing certain lotteries, and Act of 12 Dec. 1795, for like purpose ; Pamphlet Laws, 1809, p. 54, establishing a lottery for the benefit of the Presbyterian Church at Charleston. See also Pamphlet Laws, 1810, p. 58; Pamphlet Laws, 1812, p. 45 ; Pamphlet Laws, 1814, p. 65 ; Pamphlet Laws, 1815, p. 58.

Quere — if any sufficient motive can be assigned to justify the legislative permission of public gambling ? The general sentiment is at present hostile as much to Lotteries as to Faro Tables ; and the day is not far distant when legislative protection will be afforded to the regular pursuits of honest industry alone.

No. 779. Act relating to Insolvent Debtors. See Act of 1759 on this subject.

END OF THE NOTES.

TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE ACTS OF ASSEMMBLY CONTAINED IN

THIS VOLUME.

Remarks. — This volume contains 782 pages of text; commencing A.D. 1717, and ending at the year 1753, exclusive ; the number of the last Act of 1752, being 809. Grirake’s public Laws down to the commencement of 1753, ends at page 229 of his volume, and Act No. 830 of his numeration.

His volume ends at an Ordinance of 20th January, 1790, No. 1508. The Index of the present volume, therefore, leaves many titles necessarily incomplete, which are comparatively full in Grimke. I have referred to the Acts not comprized in the present volume, to which Grimke’s Index relates. Volume 4, will probably contain them.

The great proportion of Acts in this volume, are temporary Acts ; limited to various durations from one to seven years. A full Index for Acts of this limited description, would not lead, but mislead.

The custom was, anterior to our revolution, to pass occasional Acts to repeal, revive, continue, or alter such Acts of Assembly as seemed to require this supervisory regulation. A table or catalogue will be given at the end of the 4th volume, of all the Acts of Assembly that have been thus expressly repealed, revived, or continued, from the year 1682, to the close of that volume ; which I hope to finish in November next.

After the enactment of the Constitution, the Acts of Assembly assumed a more permanent character, and a great proportion of those Acts remain in force to this day. But it is manifest, that no full and satisfactory Index can be drawn up for each volume, in the present state of this work. This most essential labor can only be completed when all the Acts comprized in the body of the work are fully printed. That Index will comprize the body of existing law, as enacted by the Legislature.

In mean time, 1 have given a full Index to the contents of such Acts in the present volume, as appeared to me to require it, with references to the same subjects in the legislation of the succeeding volume, and as far as the year 1790, when Grimke’s volume of public Laws ends-These references will be comprized in the succeeding volume, which will contain the Acts to which they relate ; but the repetition can do no harm, and I have thought the trouble usefully applied to facilitate present consultation.

The notes to this volume are too few to require a separate Index, and I have therefore referred to them at the end of each corresponding title in this general Index.

The EDITOR to the READER.

IN the Preface to the First Volume, the Editor hath endeavoured to explain the Method of passing our ancient Acts of Parliament, and to reconcile some contradictory Authorities on that Subject. He hath likewise offered some general observations on the Statute Laws of this Kingdom; and concluded with specifying the Plan he proposed to pursue throughout the Courieof the Work: From which he hath found no Reason to make any Deviation. It now only remains therefore to take Notice of such matter as hath since occurred in his Progress through these Volumes; as also more particularly to explain the Method which hath been pursued in the Arrangement of the Table; and lastly, to give some Account of the Statutes which are printed separately in the Appendix.

Since the Preface was written, it hath occurred that in the fourth Section of the 18 Ed. I. stat. 4. there is an Error in the Translation which runs through all the Editions now extant; wherein the Conusors are made to acknowledge the Mannor of B. with the Appurtenances, to be the Right of our Lord the King, which he hath of their Gift, &c. Whereas it ought to be that the Conusors are made to acknowledge the Mannor, &c. to be the Right of R. that is, of Sir Robert the Conusee. - By this Statute, which prescribes the Method of passing Fines, the first Thing to be done is for the Pleader to ask of the Justice Conge de accorder, or Licence to agree. To which the Justice answers, naming one of the Parties, What will Sir R. give*? (that is, what will he pay for the Fine to the King?) "Then when they be agreed of the Sum of Money that must be given to the King, the Justice will say, Cry the Peace: And after the Pleader shall say, Insomuch as Peace is licensed unto you, that W. S. and A. his Wife, (the Conusors) that here be, do acknowledge the Manor of B. with the Appurts, to

* In the old Editions it is printed, What saith Sir R? which is not reconcileable with any Meaning whatever. This gross Inaccuracy was corrected by Mr Cay, who altered it to Who will give? and his Correction is retained in the Margin of the present Edition. But on farther Consideration, it is submitted to the reader's Judgement whether the above Translation What will Sir R. give? is not nearer to the true Sense. In the Original French it is to be observed, that the Pronoun relative que is used, Que donera sir R? but if we render it who will give? it should be the Pronoun personal qui. There is another Circumstance in favour of this Translation, which is that the Verb nomera in grammatical Order, refers to the Justice who names the Party, and not (as Lord Coke supposes) to the Pleader or Sergeant; who must name him if the Question stands who? Beside, the Question What will Sir Robert give? seems more naturally to precede the next Section; which supposes the Sum given to be agreed on, in consequence of that Question: it may be added, that this is the Question now asked on acknowledging a Fine at Bar.

"be the Right of R, (the Conusee) which he hath of their Gift." Now there can be no pretence to suppose the King's Right to the Premises to be acknowledged in this Place, for it is evident the King here can have no Claim but for the Fine upon the Licence, which is called Finis pro Licentia concordandi*: And the Foundation of this Claim to the Fine is, that by reason of the Concord between the Parties, the King loseth the Fines or Amerciaments upon the Judgement or Nonsuit, with other Advantages. As the Act stands in the old Translations, it is wholly unintelligible; and it is the more necessary to state it in a perspicuous Light, as it is of great Use, not only in explaining the subsequent Acts of Henry the VIIth and Henry the VIIIth, but also toward enabling the Student to form a right Understanding of the present Method of acknowledging Fines at Bar.

Here likewise may be noted a material Error in the 31 Eliz. c. 7. against the erecting and maintaining Cottages, which is corrected by a marginal Note. In the later Editions it is said that no Cottage shall be built, &c. unless the Cottager do lay to the same four Acres of Ground at the least, being his or her own Freehold or Inheritance, lying near the same Cottage, &c. But in Rastal and other old Editions, and likewise in 2 Inst. the Words are "his or her own Freehold and Inheritance;" and upon examining the Record they appear to be right.

The Mistake of printing this Clause in the Disjunctive might probably influence a late Adjudication in the Case of the King against Savoury, which was to this Effect. The Bishop of Norwich demised to Savoury eighty Acres, to hold to him and his Heirs for three Lives: Savoury erected a Cottage on the Land, and was indicted for having erected the same without having laid thereto four Acres of his own Freehold and inheritance: But the later Editions being referred to, where the Words are in the Disjunctive, the Court held that the Defendant had complied with the Terms of the Statute; and he was accordingly acquitted. Taking the Clause however in the Copulative, as it stands in the Record, it should seem according to Lord Coke's Comment, that "neither Grounds held by Copy, or for Life or Lives, or for any Number of Years, will serve."

A Mistake of a similar Nature runs through all the Editions in the 6 Geo. 1. c. 23. § 7. where instead of the Words order or contract, it should stand order and contract. An Error which makes a very material Variation in the Sense.

Among the Acts of the present King the following Errors likewise deserve Notice, In the 2 Geo. 3. c. 21 for Paving the Streets, &c. there is a Reference at Clause 44. to an Act made in the twelfth of King George the Second; whereas the Act referred to was made in the twelfth of George the First. In the 2 Geo. 3. c. 25. for naturalising foreign Protestants, there is likewise a Reference, at Clause 2, to an Act made in the fourth of George the First, whereas the Act referred to was made in

* This Fine pro Licentia concordandi, is sometimes called the King's Silver, and the post Fine. It is called the post Fine in contradistinction from the primer Fine, or Prefine in the Hamper; for in every Real Action of Lands and Tenements of the yearly Value of five Marks, there is due upon the Original, for every five Marks, 6s. 8d to the Hamper or Haniper: And a Writ of Covenant is held to be a real Writ for which such Fine is paid. But the post Fine is not due until the Conge d'accorder or Licence to agree be granted by the Court, and it amounts to as much as the primer Fine, and half as much more. 2. Inst. 511.

the fourth of George the Second. These however are not Errors of the Press, the Editor having carefully consulted the Parliament Rolls, wherewith the printed Statute corresponds. He therefore thought it did not become him to correct these Mistakes in the Text, but he hath rectified them in the Margin. For other more, trivial Inaccuracies the Reader is referred to the List of Errata hereto subjoined.

With regard to the Table, it is near a third more copious than any now extant. Among the Heads which have received the most considerable Additions are Certiorari, Costs, Customs, Damages, Excise, Exchequer, Felony, General Issue, Scotland, Seamen and Ships. Under Title Felony, there is added a List of Felonies both within and without Clergy, alphabetically classed; so that the Reader may at one View see what Offences belong to either Class*. Several new Heads are likewise added; and some Alterations have been made in the Disposition of the Articles, with a view to assist the Reader in the Course of his Researches. For this Purpose the Editor has been particularly attentive to specify all the relative Titles under each Head; and to facilitate the referring from the various Articles of one Head to those in another, each Article is numbered. As there are several Articles which may, without Impropriety, be classed under several general Heads, and as these will occur differently to different Readers, they who do not find the Matter they are in search of under the Head to which; they resort, will be referred to the Title under which it is classed, and directed to the very Article by Means of this numerical Arrangement. For Example, suppose the Reader should have occasion to search for the Act obliging Masters of Ships in the Plantations to carry Seamen for his Majesty's Service; he will not find the desired Information under the Titles Ships or Plantations. But under each of these Titles he will meet with a Reference directing him to Title Seamen, Art. 54. where he will see an Abstract of the very Clause which is the Object of his Enquiry.

This numerical Arrangement will also be found extremely useful, where the Relation between the Titles is not so obvious. It is moreover to be observed that in some Cases the Article referred to does not, at first Sight, appear to have any Relation whatever with the Title from whence the Reference is made. But if the Reader will consult the Clause of the Statute quoted, he will discover the Connexion. Thus, under the Title Alehouses, there is a Reference to the Title Coffee, Art. 14. in which Article there is no Expression which implies any Relation with the Title Alehouses but by perusing the Clause of the Statute, the Connexion will evidently appear. In this Case therefore the Figures are likewise of singular Use, for without such numerical Direction, the Reader might peruse every Article without discovering that in which the Relation is to be found.

In some Instances however, References are made to the correlative Titles, without any numerical Direction to particular Articles. This happens where the Relation is so very intimate, that all or the greater Part of the Articles under the Head referred to, have an obvious and reciprocal Connexion with the Head from whence the Reference is made. References are also, in some Instances, made to correlative Heads, meerly with a View of assisting the young Student to form an Analysis of the Subject before him. Thus, under the Title Purchasers, the Reader is directed to Bankrupt, Charitable Uses, Fraud, Judgments, Recognizances, Recovery, &c.

* A dreadful Catalogue! and daily multiplying!

With regard to the Acts printed separately in the Appendix, the first which appears most worthy of Observation, is the famous Dictum de Kenelworth, made in the 51 of Henry III. containing the Award made between the King and his Commons, which affords a striking Picture of the miserable State of Government among our feudal Ancestors. The Intent of this Award, for it seems to be improperly called a Statute, was apparently to quiet those who feared to be disinherited, on account of the Part they took against the King in the Civil Wars, and to ascertain what the Offenders were to pay for their Ransom. Among the rest we meet with the following curious Clause, the Purport of which is, that "Knights and Esquires who were Robbers, and among the principal Robbers in Wars and Plunderings, if they have no Lands but have Goods, shall pay half of their Goods for their Redemption; and find sufficient sureties henceforth* to keep the Peace of the King and the Kingdom." How deplorable must have been the Poverty of these Times, and the Weakness of civil Institutions!

The next Act which merits particular Notice, is the Statute of 16 Edw. II. revoking an Establishment of the Household, as being too restrictive on his Majesty, and against the Dignity of his Crown. The Establishment hereby revoked was made in the 3d of Edw. II. in Ease of the People oppressed with Purveyance; and about this Time the King's House was new formed, and every Officer's Charge and Salary was limited[2]. In these early Times the King's Household was frequently reformed at the Petition of the People. It underwent a Reformation in 36 Edw. III. and again in the 1st of Richard II. Such Liberties were taken with that weak Prince, that a Commission [3] was granted, at the Petition of the Commons, to survey and abate the Household, which not having the desired Effect, the Commons soon after petitioned that the excessive Number of his menial Servants might be reduced, and that his Household might not exceed the ordinary Revenues of the Realm. In the 4th of Hen. IV. likewise a Reformation was made in the Household, whereby the Charge was limited to 1600 Marks. And Edw the IVth, in the twelfth Year of his Reign, settled a new Form, which, as Sir Robert Cotton faith, is extant in many Hands, intitled, Ordinances for the King's House. This Book, he tells us, was amended by Cardinal Wolsey, and was, in the Time of this great Antiquarian, the Groundwork of the then Establishment. He observes, however, that it was much corrupted, and proposes either to put down the Tables, and leave all Attendants to Allowance of Money, or else by restoring the Hall again, to reduce the Household to the most magnificent Order. So all Things, he adds, being spent in Publick, will be to the King's Honour, and secret Waste will be prevented. For he concludes, that every Back-door in the Court costs the King 2000l. yearly.

It is to be observed likewise, that to ease the Charge of the King's Household, the Queens in former Times have allowed a Portion of their Jointure adequate to their own

* The words in the Latin are, quod amodi pacem servabunt &c. The word amodo is an obsolete Adverb, which signifies henceforth: And in the marginal Note, the Reader will percive that a gross Error has intervened; for instead of distinguishing it as an abverb, according to the Editor's Intention, it stands altered to quoadmodo, a word not to be found in the language.

Expence: And, among others, the Queen of Henry VI. allowed 2000 l. a Year out of her Jointure for this Purpose [1].

In this Place likewise the famous Statute of the 4th of Hen. VII. c. 19. inflicting the Penalty for decaying of Houses of Husbandry, or not laying of convenient Land for the Maintenance of the same, deserves particular Attention. About this Time, says Lord Bacon [2], Inclosures began to be frequent, whereby arable Land, which could not be manured without many Hands, was turned into Pasture, which was easily managed by a few Herdsmen; and the Tenancies for Years, Lives, and at Will, on which most of the Yeomanry subsisted, were turned into Demesnes. This bred a Decay of People, and by consequence, a Decay of Towns, Churches, Tythes, and the like. This, in the End, was attended with a Diminution of Subsidies and Taxes: For the more Gentry, the lower is the Book of Subsidies. To remedy this Inconvenience, the Legislature devised a very prudent Expedient. They did not absolutely forbid Enclosures, for that would have been forbidding Men to improve their Patrimony: Neither did they compel Tillage, for that would have been to strive against Nature: But they took a Mid-way, which redressed the Grievance by way of Consequence. For they enacted, "That all Houses of Husbandry, which were used with twenty Acres of Ground and upward, mould be maintained and kept up for ever, together with a competent Proportion of Land to be used and occupied with them." By this Means the Houses being kept up, did of necessity enforce Inhabitants; and the Proportion of Land to be occupied with them, did require such Inhabitant to be a Man of Substance, who might keep Servants, and contribute to the Improvement of Agriculture. This tended greatly to increase the Military Strength of the Nation; as by Means of these Farms, a great Part of the Lands of the Kingdom were thrown into the Hands of the Yeomanry or middle People, who were of a Condition between Gentlemen and Peasants, and made excellent Infantry [3]. Harrington and other Political Writers, very justly consider this Act among the principal Causes which concurred to throw the Power into the Hands of the People. Indeed it was the ruling Policy of this Prince, to raise the Commons by depressing the Nobility. With this View were the Statutes made against Retainers, which deprived the Lords of their Dependants, being mostly young Gentlemen of Family, who made excellent Horsemen. Thus, as by these Laws the Nobility lost their Cavalry, so by the Statute before mentioned, they were also deprived of their Infantry: And the Weight of both was thereby thrown into the popular Scale.

We proceed, in chronological Order, to the memorable Act of the 4th of Hen. VIII. c. 8. concerning Richard Strode. This has been marked, both by Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Cay, as a Private Act. Nevertheless it has been by great Authorities considered as a general Law. Lord Coke says, that the latter Branch of the second Clause is general,

1. Cotton's Post. 168

2. Lord Bacon, Vol. II. P. 294

3. It is submitted to Public Consideration, whether some Provision is not requisite at this Time, to prevent the engrossing of large Farms into one Hand: For though it may be more for the present Ease and Benefit of the Landlord to have one overgrown opulent Tenant, than to have several of moderate Circumstances; yet such a monopolizing of Farms seems to have a manifest Tendency to depopulate the Kingdom.

and declaratory of the ancient Law and Custom of Parliament and this Opinion is supported by the following Resolution of the House of Lords:

"Resolved, &c. that the Act of Parliament Hen. VIII. commonly intitled, 'An Act concerning Richard Stroud,' is a general Law, extending to indemnify all and every of the Members of both Houses of Parliament, in all Parliaments touching any Bills, speaking, reasoning, and declaring, of any Matter or Matters concerning the Parliament, to be communed and treated of, and is a declaratory Law of the antient and necessary Rights and Privileges of Parliament[2]." The Commons likewise, on the Consideration of this Act, held, that whatever concerns Privilege of Parliament, must be a general Law [3].

But with regard to Lord Coke, it must be observed, that he has misquoted the Words of the Statute. He says, it is enacted, That "all Suits, &c. from that Time" and thenceforth, to be put and had upon any Member, either of that present Parliament, or at any Parliament at any Time after that Act to be holden, for any Bills, speaking, reasoning, or declaring, of any Matter or Matters concerning the Parliament to be communed or treated of, be utterly void, &c." Now the Words of the Act are, that "all Suits, &c. put or had, or hereafter to be put or had unto or upon the said Richard, and to every other of the Person or Persons above specified, that now be of this present Parliament, or that of any Parliament thereafter, shall be, &c."

This Act, it must be confessed, is not very accurately worded. But the Provision of the foregoing Clause is evidently retrospective, and by grammatical Construction seems confined to Richard Strode, and to every other of the Person or Persons ABOVE SPECIFIED: that is, to the Persons who agreed with him in bringing in certain Bills to Parliament concerning the Tinners, which made him obnoxious to the Stannary Court, by the Authority of which he was condemned and imprisoned, &c.

It is true that the Words, "or that of any Parliament thereafter, shall be, &c." do seem to intend a general Import: But to make the Clause general, something must be supplied, and it must be amplified thus — That all such Suits, &c. put upon the said Richard, and every other of the Person or Persons before specified, or hereafter to be put on any other Member or Members, that now be, or hereafter shall be, &c.

It is to be observed likewise, that it was considered in a restrictive Sense by the Judges in the 5 of Car. 1. to whom a Question was propounded by the Attorney General upon this Act, and they resolved that this Statute "was particular Act of Parliament, and extended only to Richard Strode and to those Persons that had joined with him to prefer a Bill to the House of Commons concerning the Tinners:" But they added "that although the Act be private, and extendeth to them alone, yet it was no more than all other Parliament Men, by Privilege of House, ought to have, &c." viz. Freedom of Speech concerning the Matters debated in Parliament, in a parliamentary Course [4].

2. See Lord's Journal, Die Mecurii, 1667.

3. See Grey's Parl. Debates, 38.

4. See Rushworth's Collections, 662.

With regard to the Resolutions of the two Houses, it must be remembered that they were formed flagrante ira, on occasion of the Debate concerning the arbitrary Proceedings against Sir John Elliot, Denzill Hollis, &c. A Time when the Contests Between Privilege and Prerogative were carried to the most desperate Extremes; and when many unwarrantable Claims were asserted on each Side, and endeavoured to be supported by straining and perverting every kind of Evidence which could give Colour to unjustifiable Conclusions.

This Point however, concerning the Freedom of parliamentary Debate, was happily adjusted at the late Resolution; and it is declared by the Bill of Rights — "That the Freedom of Speech, and Debates or Proceedings in Parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parliament."

Particular Notice likewise is due to the 28th Hen. VIII. c. 7. concerning the Succession of the Crown : This is not inserted in the Editions of Serjeant Hawkins, or Mr. Cay. They both consider it as repealed by 1 Mary, Sess. 2. c. 1. which is also printed in this Appendix. But the Serjeant has added, that it is revived by 1 Eliz. c. 1. Dr. Gibson likewise speaks of it as repealed [1], but in the Case of Harrison and Burwell [2], Vaughan argues on a Supposition of its being unrepealed. Supposing it however to be repealed by 1 Mary, Sess. 2. c. 1. it does not appear to be revived by 1 Eliz. c. 1. as the Serjeant supposes. But indeed it may very well be doubted whether it be wholly repealed by the Statute of Mary: For after reciting the 25 and 28 of Hen. it is by the third Clause of that Statute enacted, That as well the said Act of Parliament intitled, An Act declaring the Establishment of the Succession, &c. made in the 25th Year of your Father, be repealed, as also all and every such Clauses, Articles, Branches, and Matters, contained and expressed in the aforesaid Act of Parliament, made in the said 28th Year, or in any other Act: or Acts of Parliament, as whereby your Highness is declared to be illegitimate, &c. shall be repealed." Hereby the Act of the 25th is wholly repealed, and the Act of the 28th seems to be no farther repealed, than with respect to those Clauses which declare the illegitimacy of Mary. Therefore it may reasonably be supposed to stand in Force as to other Points which do not regard that Subject; and it contains some Clauses concerning the Degrees of Marriage prohibited by God's Law, and against the Power of dispensing with Marriages within such Degrees, which are well worthy of observation. It is happy for the Cause of Religion and Liberty, that this Prince found the Pope refractory. Had the Pope favoured Henry's Inconstancy, he probably would never have disputed the Validity of his Holiness's Dispensations. For that he had no Aversion to Papistical Tenets, may be collected from the succeeding Act in this Appendix, viz.

The 31 Hen. VIII. c. 14. " For abolishing Diversity of Opinions in certain Articles concerning Christian Religion." This and some other very singular Acts of this Reign, seem to be levelled more against the Pope than against Popery. By this Act it is most solemnly resolved and agreed, that Priests may not marry, and that private Masses, and auricular Confession, are expedient, and necessary to be retained: With other extraordinary Resolutions, which it is made Felony without Clergy to contradict.

1. Burn's Eclesiastical Law, Vol. II. p. 5.

2. 2 Vent 9.

Of a Piece with these Retaliations, are several Clauses of this Act, which confound all Degrees of Offence, and all Distinctions of Morality. By the 8th Clause it is enacted, "That if any Priest keep or use any Woman, to whom he is, or hath been married, or with whom he hath contracted Matrimony; every such carnal Use, open Conversation, &c. shall be adjudged Felony, as well against the Man, as against the Woman." But,

By the 9th Clause it is enacted, "That if any Priest do carnally use, and accustom any Woman, or keep her as his Concubine, as by paying for her Board, maintaining her with Money, Array, or any Gifts, &c. that then he shall forfeit all his Goods, Chattels, and Benefices, &c. and suffer Imprisonment: And offending after Conviction, shall be adjudged guilty of Felony."

Thus we find that a Priest cohabiting with a Wife, [the Malum Prohibitum by this Statute] was deemed guilty of Felony in the first Instance: Whereas by cohabiting with a Concubine, he only incurred the Forfeiture of Goods and Imprisonment for the first Offence; and was not deemed guilty of Felony until the second. So that an Offence against the Resolutions of the Convocation and Parliament, was deemed of a more heinous Nature than a Violation of the Laws of Religion and Morality.

We now come to the Consideration of the First of Edward VI. for the Punishment of Vagabonds, and for the Relief of poor and impotent Persons. The Preamble recites, "That idle and vagabond Persons, being unprofitable Members, or rather Enemies of the Commonwealth, have been suffered to remain and increase, whom, if they should be punished with Death, Whipping, Imprisonment, and other corporal Pain, it were not without their Deserts, for the Example of others." Having in this Manner declared, that these wretched Vagabonds deserved Death, &c. (though their Idleness was probably more the Fault of the State than of themselves) the Enacting-part of this severe Statute was doubtless deemed merciful: For it only enacts, that the Offender there described to be an idle Person, shall be taken before a Justice of Peace, who shall cause him to be marked with a hot Iron in the Breast, the Mark V, and adjudge him to be a Slave to the Person presenting him for two Years, to be fed with Bread and Water, and to be put to Work (how vile soever it be) by beating, chaining, &c. and if he runs away, the Justice, on Conviction, shall cause such Slave to be marked on the Forehead, or Ball of the Cheek, with the Sign of an S, and shall farther adjudge him to be his Master's Slave for ever: And if he again run away, he shall suffer Death as a Felon. There is likewise a Proviso in this Act, by which they might be sold or bequeathed by Will, as any other moveable Goods or Chattels. By the 39 Eliz. c. 4. also printed in this Appendix, they were to be whipped until their Bodies were bloody, or to be banished the Kingdom, or adjudged perpetually to the Gallies of the Realm.

The Editor however is sensible that the Inhumanity of these Laws will admit of some Palliation, when we consider the Time when they were made, which was soon after the Dissolution of the religious Houses, which afforded an Asylum for all poor and impotent People, When these therefore were set at large, without the Means of gaining a

Livelihood, and destitute of any Retreat where they might hope for a Provision, the Mischief to be apprehended from Vagrants, must certainly have been very alarming.

What next Claims our Observation is the memorable Act of 13 Car. 2. c. 33. intitled, 'An Act for preventing Abuses, in printing seditious, treasonable and unlicensed Books and Pamphlets; and for regulating Printing and Printing Presses.' By this Act Printers are forbidden to publish any heretical, seditious, schismatical or offensive [1] Books, and all Books and Pamphlets are to be licensed by particular Licensers appointed according to the Nature of the Subject, and the Number of Printing Presses are hereby limited.

The Troubles which had subsisted in the late Reign, had given Birth to a free Spirit of political Inquiry, which this Statute was calculated to suppress: And it is observable, that this Act is founded on a Decree of the Star Chamber [2], made in the Year 1637, which it copies without any material Variation, except, that by the Decree Offenders are to be punished as by the Honourable Court of Star Chamber, or the High Commission Court, shall be thought fit; whereas by the Act they are to be punished by Disability to exercise their Profession, and such farther Punishment, not extending to Life or Limb, as the Justices of the King's Bench, or of Oyer and Terminer, &c. shall think fit. It is remarkable also, that the Preamble to this Decree of the Star Chamber takes Notice of divers Decrees and Ordinances made for regulating Printers and Printing, in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, which are said to have been defective in some Particulars. From hence we may see what early Attempts were made to restrain this invaluable Liberty. So intolerant is the Nature of Power, wherever lodged, that they who have loudest exclaimed against such Restriction as a Badge of Slavery, were no sooner inverted with full Sway, than they began to work on the same Principles of Oppression. About the Year 1644, the Parliament made Ordinances for restraining the Press, which were framed on the Plan of the above Star Chamber Decree; and against which Milton published a Treatise, called Areopagitica [3].

This Act was last continued by 1 Jac. 2. c. 17. for seven Years from June 1685; but being incompatible with the noble Principles of the Resolution, it has never since been, and it is to be hoped never will be, revived [4].

The Appendix likewise contains some very curious Acts never before printed, to the Editor's Knowledge. Of these the first is, the Second of Henry V. for the Union

1. The Word Offensive is a Word of dangerous Latitude : But the Words are copied liberatim from the Star Chamber Decree, of which mention will be made hereafter.

2. This Decree is so scarce, that it is imagined there is only one copy Extant, which is preserved in a private Library.

3. There is an edition of the Areopagiticia published by A. Millar in 1738, with a sensible and spirited Preface, by Mr. Thomson, Author of the Seasons.

4. It is impossible, however, on this Occasion to avoid lamenting the many flagrant Instances, wherein the Liberty of the Press has been lately abused by such wanton and indiscriminate Scurrility, as tends to make publick Censure lose its Effect, and render Men callous to the Stings of Reproof.

of the Rights and Possessions of the Earldom of Hereford to the Dutchy of Lancaster. These Possessions of the Earl of Hereford descended to Henry V. as Heir to his Mother, who was the Daughter and Heiress of Humphry Bohun, Earl of Hereford, Essex and Northumberland, and Constable of England: And without this Act the King would have been seized thereof in Jure Coronae; therefore this Act was necessary to sever them from the Crown, which was done by annexing them to the Dutchy of Lancaster, which had been severed before.

This Act is immediately followed by 3 Hen. V. confirming the King's Letters Patent, respecting the Dutchy of Lancaster and its Stewards; which provides, that the Stewards of the said Dutchy shall be Justices of Peace within their Circuit; and that no Grant of any thing from the said Dutchy would pass but under the usual Seal.

For the better understanding these Statutes, it is to be observed with regard to the Dutchy of Lancaster, that it was first erected into a County Palatine[1] by the 50 Ed. III. who honoured his Son John of Gaunt with it for the Term of his Life. It afterwards descended to Henry IV. in Right of his Mother. This politic Prince knew that his Title to the Dutchy was sure and indefeazible, and that he should be seized thereof as King, not as Duke: He knew likewise, that his regal Title was unjustly founded, and that he held the Scepter by a precarious Tenure; therefore, to avoid involving his patrimonial with his regal Rights, he very prudently passed a Charter by Authority of Parliament, by which the Possessions of the Dutchy were severed from the Crown; and thus it continued for some Time. But it is said, that the Possessions of the Duke of Lancaster were not made a Ducatus until the 2 Hen. V. for in the Parliament Roll of this Year, it is entered Quod figilla pro ducatu Lancastriæ allocentur, and that it should be governed per mintstros ducatus [2].

The next memorable Statutes relative to this Dutchy, are two Acts passed in the 1 Edw. IV. being, among other Things, Acts of Forfeiture and Attainder against Henry VI. his Queen Margaret, and a great Number of Noblemen and Gentlemen of the Lancastrian Party. By these Acts the Dutchy of Lancaster and the County Palatine are united, being assured to Edw. IV. and his Heirs, Kings of England: And this was necessary, for without a Saving Statute, the County Palatine might have determined by the Attainder. Before these Acts, the Dutchy and the County Palatine were distinct Bodies, but they are hereby made one; and a Superiority is given to the Dutchy, as the supreme Name of Corporation. It is curious to observe in the Recitals to the first of these Acts, how minutely every Circumstance of Devastation and Cruelty, necessarily attendant on Civil Wars, is here enumerated and imputed wholly to the vanquished Party.

1. Counties Palatine are certain Counties which have Jura Regalia for the Administration of Justice, &c. within themselves. They are either by Prescription, such as Chester; or by Statute, as this of Lancaster. These Palatinates had their Foundation in good Policy; for it is reasonably supposed, that Lancaster, Durham and Chester were so made, because they were adjacent to Enemies Countries, viz. the two first to Scotland, and Chester to Wales. So that the Inhabitants having Administration of Justice at home, and not being obliged to attend other Courts, those Parts were not left destitute of Men, who might secure the Country from Incursions. The Power of these Counties Palatine was antiently very exorbitant, but was greatly abridged by 27 Hen. 8. c. 24.

2. See Inst. 204. 1 Vent. 157.

The History of this Dutchy is farther illustrated by the Act of 1 Henry VII. for vesting the Dutchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, &c. in Henry VII. and his Heirs, without saying Kings of England, and for settling the Dutchy of Cornwal on the first born Son of the said Henry. It is observable, that Henry VII. derived his Title under Henry IV. and that he copied the Policy of that Prince by separating the Dutchy again from the Crown.

The Reader will also find a very singular Act of the 1 Eliz. giving Authority to the Queen's Majesty upon the Avoidance of any Archbishoprick or Bishoprick, to take into her Hands certain of the temporal Possessions thereof; recompensing the same with Parsonages impropriate, and Tenths. This indeed was an effectual way of securing the Revenue; and such a short and peremptory Expedient as was very confident with the Policy of this Princess.

The last of the Acts which, to the Editor's Knowlege, have never been in Print before, is the Statute of 13 Car. II. st. 1. for the Regulation of the publick Office of the Masters in Chancery; by which the Fees are settled and the Hours of Attendance ascertained.

There are likewise several other Statutes in this Appendix, which do not require any Explanation or Comment; but which nevertheless contain not only Subjects of Curiosity to the Antiquarian, but Matter of Information to the Historian and Philosopher; who from thence may discover the Causes of many successive Changes which the Constitution hath undergone: And there cannot be a more pleasing and useful Exercise of the Mind, than to trace the Progress toward Refinement, through all the rude Stages of civil Policy. From such an Investigation, however, we shall be led to conclude, that fortuitous Events have often contributed, more than human. Foresight, toward its Improvement [1].

1. However the Statute Law of this Kingdom may fall short of Perfection, which no human Institutions can attain, yet it ought to be prized by every Friend of our excellent Constitution; as among other Excellencies, it contains the valuable Charters by which we hold that Liberty which is our peculiar Boast. With regard to the Great Charter, though it is obsolete, so far as it regards the feudal Regulations; the 29th: Clause, nevertheless, which contains general Provisions for the Preservation of publick Freedom, and the Security of Property, is still in force. The Liberties of the Subject, however, are farther and more particularly ascertained by the famous Petition of Right of the 3 Car. I. whereby the Lords and Commons, among other Things, claim, that no Man be compelled to make or yield any Loan, Tax, or such like Charge, but by Consent of Parliament: That no Freeman be imprisoned for such Refusal: That no Soldiers or Mariners be quartered upon the People, &c.

1 cont. It is observable, that when the Commons had framed this Petition, and presented it to the Lords for their Concurrence, the latter thought proper to make the following Addition in the Conclusion:

1 cont. "We present this our humble Petition, to your Majesty, with the Care not only of preserving our own Liberties, but with due regard to leave entire that Sovereign Power wherewith your Majesty is trusted for the Protection, Safety and Happiness of the People."

1 cont. This Addition produced a Conference between the two Houses, wherein the Commons objected against the dangerous Saving included in those Words Sovereign Power; and their Arguments were so cogent and irresistible, that they induced the Lords to withdraw their Addition: And they at length agreed in all Points with the Commons.*

1 cont. It is worthy of Remark, with how much Difficulty his Majesty was brought to give a satisfactory Answer to this Petition. At first he answered, "The King willeth, that right be done according to the Laws and Customs of the Realm, &c." But this not being thought sufficiently clear and precise, the Commons pressed his Majesty to be more explicit: To which he replied, "The Answer I have already given you, was made with so good Deliberation, and approved by the Judgments of so many wise Men, that I could not have imagined, but it mould have given you full Satisfaction; but to avoid all ambiguous Interpretations, and to shew you there is no Doubleness in my Meaning, I am willing to pleasure you in Words as well as Substance: Read your Petition, and you shall have an Answer that I am sure will please you." Whereupon the Petition being read, the King returned the Answer, which the Reader will find in the Statute Book: Sett Droit salt tome est desire.

1 cont. But the last and most glorious Charters, by which our Liberty is secured, are the Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement. By these there is an actual Compact established between the King and the Subject. The Rights of the People are enumerated and asserted, the Crown is tendered and accepted, on the Condition of the King's preserving the Rights so asserted, from Violation: And publick Liberty is not left to be supported by obsolete Precedents or litigated Interpretations.

*. For the Speeches made on this Occasion, see Rushworth's Collections, Vol. 1.

Besides the Acts printed in the Appendix, which have been omitted by late Editors, the Reader will find several in the Body of the Work which are not inserted in later Editions. Some of these are promised in the Preface; such as 1 R. III. touching Acts of Cestui que use, the 34 and 35 H. VIII. c. 4. concerning Bankrupts [1], the 39 Eliz. respecting Poor Laws, the 13 Eliz. for making the River Lee navigable, and the 12 Geo. II. for improving its Navigation. There are others likewise which it has been judged expedient to insert therein, such as the 10 W. III. c. 1. for granting an Aid to his Majesty for disbanding the Army, and other necessary Occasions, and the and 5

2. In the 34th and 35th of Henry the Eighth, which is the first Act against Bankrupts, and which in this Edition is printed at large, there is a Clause which appears to be unrepealed; and which is as follows:

2. cont. And be it enacted, That if any such Person or Persons, which shall be indebted, do withdraw himself out of this Realm, or other the King's Dominions, into any foreign Realm or Country, to the Intent thereby to abide and remain in Defraud of his Creditors; that then, upon Complaint in Writing, concerning the Premises thereof, made to the said Lords, having Authority as is aforesaid, the same Lords shall, by Virtue and Authority of this present Act, have full Power and Authority to award Proclamations to be made in such Places as to them shall be thought meet and convenient; commanding by the same, such Offender, in the King our Sovereign Lord's Name, to return with all convenient Speed into this Realm, and to yield his Body before the said Lords, having Authority as is aforesaid, or one of them; and if the said Person, within three Months next after he shall have knowledge of such Proclamation, or as soon after as he conveniently may, do not repair and yield his Body as aforesaid, that then the Body of all and every such Offender and Offenders, shall be judged, taken and deemed, to all Intents and Purposes, out of the King's Protection: And that also all Goods, Chattels, Lands, Tenements and Debts of every such Offender, shall be, by Order of the said Lords, employed and distributed among his Creditors, equally and indifferently, Rate for Rate, in like Manner and Form as is afore declared.

2. cont. This Clause seems to have provided against a Consequence not within the Letter of the subsequent Statutes: For those Statutes only make it an Act of Bankruptcy to depart the Realm with Intent to defraud Creditors; but if a Debtor should go abroad without such fraudulent Intent, and with the Knowledge and Consent of his Creditors; and should afterwards remain there, and grow in opulent Circumstances, without paying any Regard to his Creditors : In this Case it might be doubted, whether he were a Bankrupt within the Description of these Acts. But the Clause above mentioned provides a Remedy against such, as having withdrawn themselves out of the Realm, remain there with Intent to defraud their Creditors; and in this Respect is more full than the subsequent Statutes.

W. III. c. 1, for granting to their Majesties an Aid of four Shillings in the Pound, &c.[2]

The Editor, in short, hath been careful to insert all such Statutes, however antiquated, as appeared to him to contain any useful Information, or which might afford any Insight into the Constitution; and he hath, upon the whole, endeavoured to render this Collection as compleat as his Abilities and Power of Attention would allow him [3] They who are best acquainted with the Difficulty of executing an Undertaking like This, will be most indulgent to its Defects.

2. The 10 W. 3. c. 1. in the later Editions, is said to be expired; but it may be questioned, whether in Part it is not still in Force. With regard to the 4 & 5 W. 3. c. 1. all the subsequent Land Tax Acts refer to it, and Assessments are made from it. Though, properly speaking, the 1 W. 3. c. 20. which is to be found in the Appendix, is the first Land Tax Act.

3. Among the various Proposals which have been suggested for the Improvement of this Edition, one of our Correspondents propossed our printing all the Acts relating to particular Manors. But such a Plan would have enlarged this Collection to a very inconvenient Size: As the Statute Laws of this Kingdom are now become so exceedingly voluminous, and are daily increasing, both in Number and Extent, it is almost impracticable to retain those Acts which are merely local. For this Reason it has been usual in the later Editions to omit the Road Acts, and others, which, though they are declared to be publick Acts, are nevertheless of a local and private Nature. It has been thought proper, however, to preserve the Titles of such Acts in the present Edition; and some of them having been omitted in the Table of Contents to the eighth Volume, they are prefixed to the Contents of this: Though, perhaps, had they been wholly left out, it would have been no Loss to our Purchasers; as the Acts themselves are now never printed, even in the annual Collections.

[Preamble. 31 Geo. 2. c. 29.]

WHEREAS by an Act of Parliament made in the thirty-first Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, intituled, An Act for the due making of Bread, and to regulate the Price and Assize thereof; and to punish Persons who shall adulterate Meal, Flower or Bread; certain Powers are granted to the several Courts, Magistrates, and Justices of the Peace therein mentioned, to set, ascertain and appoint the Assize and Weight of Bread which shall be made for Sale, or exposed to Sale, and the Price to be paid for the same respectively, within the Bounds of their several Jurisdictions, from time to time, as they shall think proper: And it is thereby enacted, That in every assize of Bread which shall be so set and appointed, Respect shall, from time to time, be had to the Price which the Grain, Meal or Flour, whereof such Bread shall be made, shall bear in the publick Market or Markets in or near the publick Place or Places for which any such Assize shall be so at any Time set; and for ascertaining such Price of Grain, Meal, or Flour, from time to time, the several Courts, Magistrates, and Justices of the Peace therein mentioned, are thereby impowered, from time to time, as there shall be Occasion, within their several Jurisdictions, to cause the respective Prices which the several Sorts of Grain, Meal and Flour shall, from time to time, bona fide sell for in such publick Markets, to be given in and certified upon Oath unto such Court, Magistrates, or Justices of the Peace respectively, within their several Jurisdictions, by the Clerk of the Market, or by such Person or Persons, and in such Manner, and on such Day of the Week, as they shall respectively appoint within their several Jurisdictions; and the Price which shall be so certified shall, from time to time, be entered by the respective Person or Persons who shall certify the same, in a Book or Books to be provided and kept by him or them for that Purpose, in the Form and Manner as therein directed: And whereas the above Method of ascertaining the Price of Wheat and Rye, and the Flour and Meal made of those Grains, cannot take Place within that Part of Great Britain called Scotland, by reason that there are few publick Markets for such Grains, Flour or Meal, within that Part of the United Kingdom; and where there are publick Markets for Grain, Flour or Meal of any Kind, there is no such Officer as Clerk of the Market, who can certify to the Magistrates or Justices of the Peace the respective Prices which the several Sorts of Grain, Meal and Flour sell for in such publick Markets; whereby the Salutary Effect and Execution of the said Act made for the whole United Kingdom, is prevented and totally disappointed within that Part thereof called Scotland:

For Remedy whereof, Be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same,

[Magistrates and Justices to enquire into, and take prices which the several Sorts of bread Corn, Meal and Flour, sell for in the public markets;]

[and where there are no publick markets, then to take Proof the present or of last selling Price thereof;]

or where there are no publick Markets for any particular Species of Grain, Meal or Flour, in or near such City, Borough or Place, to inquire into and take Proof of the present or last selling Price of such Species of Grain, Meal or Flour, whether of the Growth of the Country or brought from distant Places; to which selling Price or prime Cost shall be added such an Allowance for the Expence and Risk of Carriage or Transportation, as from the Enquiry and Proof shall to the said Magistrates and Justices of the Peace appear just and reasonable;

[so as to ascertain the Price the same costs the Baker;]

so as that the Price of such Grain, Meal or Flour be, from time to time, ascertained according to what those several Species do or may truly cost the Bakers before they can manufacture the same into Bread.

[they giving previous Notice to the Deacon of the Bakers Company, or to two reputable Bakers, to attend the taking of such Proof.]

II. And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That previous to the Proof to be taken in the several Cases aforesaid, Notice in Writing shall be given to the Deacon of the Incorporation of Bakers, or where there is no such Incorporation, to any two reputable Bakers within the City, where such Proof is to be taken, forty-eight Hours at least before taking the same, such Proof is to the end that the Makers of Bread within such City, Borough or Place may, if they think proper, attend the taking such Proof, and suggest such Questions as may be proper to be put to the Witnesses summoned by the Magistrates or Justices of the Peace respectively, or offer such other

A.D. 1762. Anno tertio Georgii III. C. 6. 3

III. And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That such Proof shall only proceed upon the Oaths of two or more credible Witnesses, conversant in the Prices of the several Sorts of Grain, Meal or Flour, which shall be the Subject of such Inquiry, or by Writings legally proved; and that it shall and may be lawful to the said Magistrates and Justices of the Peace, within their respective Jurisdictions, to summon such Person or Persons as to them shall appear most proper for that Purpose, and to compel them to appear and give their Evidence; and that either by such Remedies, and under such Penalties as are provided by the said Act, in the Case of Persons duly summoned to give Evidence, touching the Rates and Prices of the several Sorts of Grain, Meal and Flour where the Return of the Prices of such Grain, Meal or Flour shall be suspected as not truly and bona fide made, or by such Remedies as are competent by the Common Law of Scotland, for compelling Witnesses to appear and give Evidence in any judicial Trial before a competent Court.

and which Declaration shall be ingrossed in the and entered in the said Book appointed to be kept as aforesaid, immediately after the Evidence, and shall be signed by the Book, and signed by the Magistrates or Justices of the Peace respectively, before whom such Proof shall be taken; and which Book containing the Evidence and Declaration aforesaid, shall be open and patent to the Inspection of the Makers of Bread, and all other Persons, without Fee or Reward; and shall to all Intents and Purposes be deemed and taken to be equivalent to the Returns or Certificates of the Market Prices of all Kinds of Grain, Meal, Flour, appointed to be taken by the said Act:

[The Assize and Weight of Bread for Sale, to be ascertained according thereto.]

And the Magistrates and Justices of the Peace in that Part of Great Britain called Scotland shall thereupon proceed to set, ascertain and appoint the Assize and Weight of all Sorts of Bread, which shall be made for Sale, or exposed to Sale, and the Price to be paid for the same, within their respective Jurisdictions, when and as often, from time to time, as they shall think fit, according to the Directions, and agreeable to the Tables enacted and referred to by the said Act.

[The Assize not liable to be varied, but to continue in Force till a new one is made.]

VI. Provided always, and be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That when and so often as any Assize of Bread shall be let, ascertained and appointed, for any City, Borough or Place, within that Part of Great Britain called Scotland, by the Magistrates or Justices of the Peace impowered for that Purpose, such Assize shall not be limited to indure for any certain Time, but shall continue and stand in Force until a new Assize of Bread be set, ascertained and appointed by the said Magistrates or Justices of the Peace, for such City, Borough or Place respectively; any Thing in the aforesaid Act of the thirty-first Year of the Reign of his late Majesty to the contrary notwithstanding.

And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That upon an Application in Writing by any two or more of the Inhabitants or Bakers, within any City, Borough or County where such Assize of Bread shall be set, to the Magistrates or Justices of the Peace who set the last Assize, or to the Magistrates or Justices of the Peace of such City, Borough or County for the Time being, setting forth, and offering to prove, by proper Evidence, that the Price of any of the Species of Grain before mentioned has rose or fallen since the last Assize of Bread was set, so as to authorise an Alteration of such last Assize, according to the aforesaid Act of his late Majesty, and Tables therein referred to; in every such Case, the Magistrates or Justices of the Peace to whom such Application shall be made, shall within their respective Jurisdictions be obliged to take Evidence of the then current Prices, in the Manner before directed;

[Fresh Evidence is to be taken of the current Price, and a new Assize to be made conformable thereto.]

and if upon advising such Proof, they shall find such a Variation of the Prices since the last Assize, as described in the said Act, they shall immediately set and ascertain a new Assize of Bread, which shall remain till altered agreeable to the Directions herein before given.

[Method of Proceeding in case of Conviction of Offenders in the recited or present Act.]

WHEREAS the Laws now in force, for the raising and training the Militia, within that Pl mbie Part of Great Britain called England, are in 'Tome Respects defective: whereas fre qhent Delays, and many Difficulties have occurred in the Execution of the Acts now in force for raising and training the Militia, from the Manner in which the whole Execution of the Acts is made to depend in all Counties, Ridings, and Places, where the Militia has been or shall be raised, upon holding a General Meeting, on either the last Tuesday in October, or the la ft Puefday in May, in each Year and Doubts have arisen, whether, in such Case, any subsequept General Meetings can now be called for the Purposes of the said Acts, unless there shall have been a previous general Meeting on one of the Days before specified May it therefore please your Majesty, that it may be enacted; be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and maybe lawful for his J" 9?lmtics w, ierc the majesty's Lieutenant of every County, Riding, and Place, where the Militia has been or shall be teraftej, generalmtet raised, together with any two or more Deputy Lieutenants, and on the Death or Removal, or in ingsmfy befjmmor d the Absence of his Majesty's Lieutenant, any three or more Deputy Lieutenants, whenever and as in the stine manner as often as they shall find necessary, to summon, or cause to be summoned, a general Meeting, ac !n Coumies "here the cording to the Directions of the Act passed in the second Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, avelhe'"

for summoning general Meetings in Counties where the Militia has not been raised; general rhyme powers Meetings Meetings herein directed, shall have the same Powers as if such general Meetings' had been held on held on the lad Tueftay the I aft Tuesday in May, or on the last Tuesday in October, in each Year, in pursuance of the said inmjy.of the last tuef day in october.

II. And whereas the raising the Militia has, in some Counties, been delayed by the Vacancy of Lord Lieutenants in particular Counties, and it is essential to the Good of the Service, and the Establishment of a Militia, which, to be effectual, should be general, that such local Difficulties should he removed for the future; 'Be it therefore enacted, and it is hereby enacted, That in every In every County, C County, Riding, and Place, where the Office of Lord Lieutenant is, or shall be vacant, it flvall and 'v.bere the office of Eord may be lawful for his Majesty, his Heirs and successors, to appoint three Persons out of the Deputy poffi"three

Lieutenants of any such County, Riding, or Place, to execute the Office of Lord Lieutenant of Deputy lieu tenants, to such County, Riding, or Place, so far as the same relates to the executing the several Powers and execute that Office, so Authorities veiled in Lieutenants, in and by the several Acts of Parliament for the raising and train as relates to the _acts ing the Militia, during such Vacancy. fhetjv?tli tnaa"d trainln-s

CIV. And whereas it is become necessary to prevent themilitiamen of one County from inrolling ft j e l0" nu

themselves in the Militia of another; 'Be it therefore enacted, That if any Person, alter being enrolled in the Militia of one County, Riding, or Place, shall, during such Service, engage and be A Personbeing involled

enrolled to serve in the Militia of any other County, Riding, or Place, he shall, upon Conviction toftrveinthemilitiaof

thereof before any one Justice of the Peace of the County in which he shall last enter into the said and be in

V. And whereas the Provisions in the said Act passed in the second Year of the Reign of his Months, present Majesty, for reimbursing Officers of Parishes the Moneys by them expended for the Refief

of Militia Men, who on their March, or at the Place where they shall be called out to annual Exercise, shall, by Sicknefsor otherwise, want such Relief, have been found insufficient for the Purposes thereby intended Be it therefore enacted, That in case any Man serving in the Militia shall, ft, 1 ln. °" on the March, or at the Place where he shall be called out to annual Exercise, he disabled by exc ofr ^ii'ibled by Sickness or otherwise, it shall and may be lawful for any one Justice of the Peace of the County, sickness or otherwise. to Riding, or Place, or any Mayor or chief Magistrate of any City, Town, or Place, where such be relieved byhe Offi man shall then he, by Warrant under his Hand and Seal, to order him such Relief as he shall think cers of the Panffi where reasonable; the Officers of the Parish, Tything, or Place, where such Militia Man shall be so ^fl^otvce s^bereim1" relieved, shall, upon producing an Account of the Expenses occasioned thereby, allowed under the buried thee peme5 oc hand of a Justice of the Peace, to the Treasurer of the County, Riding, or Place, for which such cjrroned thereby, out of

A Drummer negligent in

Militia Man shall ftrve, shall be reimbtirfed such Expenses by the treasurer of such County, out of the County Stock, and such Treasurer shall, upon producing such Account allowed as aforesaid, be allowed the same in his Accounts.

VI. And whereas, as the Laws for regulating the Militia now (land, no Power is given of pu willing such Militia Men as shall, after having joined their Corps, desert during the Time of an nual Exercise, and not be taken till after the Expiration of the Time of such annual Ex ' crcife, and consequently of the Period now fixed for the Continuance of martial Law; 'Be it havin'3 ^ofncd' they t^ere^orc ena&ete ( hat if any Militia Man shall so offend, and not be apprehended during the Corp (ha desertj du Time of such annual Exercise, every such Militia Man, being thereof convicted upon Oath, before ing the Time of annual one Justice of the Peace of any County where such Militia Man shall be apprehended, shall incur

Xxercife, and shall not the Penalty, and he subject to the Punishment, inflicted by the said Act of the second Year of his

be taken nil after the f.x present Majesty upon Militia Men not joining their Corps.

VII. And whereas it would be very conducive to the Preservation of Order and Discipline, du ring the Time of annual Exercise, of great Convenience to the Corporals and Private Militia Men ' in the supplying them with necdtaries, and of essential Utility to their respective Families, if the Captains or commanding Officers were enabled to (lop a limited Parc of the daily Pay of such Cor ' porals and Private Men when called out to annual Exercise; 'Be it therefore enacted, That it shall ing Officer mny put_cor anc may be lawful for every Captain or commanding Officer of the Militia, to put the Corporals and under stoppages, not ex Private Militia Men of his Company under Stoppages, not exceeding sixpence a Day, for the pur ceeding 6d. a Day. and poses aforesaid: always, That every Captain and commanding Officer shall account with mall account with them each Corporal and Private Militia Man for the said Stoppages, before such Corpora! or Private Man tov such Stoppiigcs before f]mil be dismissed from the said annual Exercise, having first deducted what shall have been laid out for them for Necessaries and Repair of Arms damaged by their Neglect.

VIII. And whereas no Powers are granted by the said Act passed in the second Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, for punishing Drummers for Misbehaviour during the Time the Militia to which they belong is not called out to annual Exercise (except by their being displaced by their Captain) which Defect in the Law has been found inconvenient to the Service of the Militia Be it therefore enacted, That if any Drummer shall be negligent in his his Duty, or disobedient Duty, or disobedient to the Orders of the Adjutant, or other his superior Officers, and be thereof to the Orders of the Ad convicted upon the Oath of the Adjutant, or other superior Officer, or other credible Witness, be "ofleer, °to°fcrfeit not*0r orc one or more Justice or Justices of the Peace of the County in the Militia of which such drum cxreedi ng or if not mer serves, such Ehummer shall forfeit and pay any Sum not exceeding forty Shillings, at the dif iirmediately paid, the cretion of such Justice or Justices; and if such Drummer shall not immediately pay such Penalty, it Captain of the Company shall and may be lawful for the Captain, or commanding Officer of the Company of Militia to Drumm'c^ ° the' Drummer shall belong, and he is hereby required to flop the Pay of such Drummer,

IX. And whereas by the said Act passed in the second Year of the Reign of his present Majesty,

it is enacted, That in all Counties and Places where the Militia has not, or shall not be raised,

by virtue of the several Acts made forraifing the Militia Forces, that the Sum of five Pounds shall be annually paid for and in lieu of every Private Man therein directed to be raised within each re foeftive County, Riding, and Place; which said Sum and Sums of five Pounds per Man, the Justices of the Peace of each respective County, Riding, and Place, assembled at their General or Quarter Sessions, are directed to rate and assess on the County; and that the said Sum and Sums shall be rated and assessed in such and the same manner, and according to such and the famepropor tions, upon every Town, Parish, and Place, within each respective County or Riding, and shall be collected, received, levied, paid, and accounted for, by the Persons making such Collection,

ass ejfing, collering, and levying of County Rates, be afieffed, collected, received, levied, paid, and

accounted for: And whereas there are several Cities, Towns, and Places, in many Counties and Ridings, which do not contribute to the Payment of the said Rate, called the County Rate, by reason whereof Doubts have arisen, whether such Cities, Towns, and Places can be legally rated or afieffed towards the Payment of the said Sum and Sums of five Pounds per Man, in pursuance of the Directions of the said Act of the second Year of the Reign of his present Majesty:

whereas it is just and reasonable, that all such Cities, Towns, and Places, (hold bear an equal Share and Proportion of the said Payment of five Pounds per Man with each County or Riding within which such Cities, Towns, and Places, may happen to liebe it therefore enacted, That in all Cases where the Militia has not been raised, or shall not at any Time hereafter be raised, for any County or Riding, within which any City, Town, or Place, shall not be rated to the said Rate

[Preamble.]

Manufact[ou]ry

WHEREAS the establishing a Manufacture of Linens in England, of the Kind usually known under the Denomination of Cambricks and French Lawns, will be of great Utility to this Kingdom, as well by the Employment of a great Number of Poor, as by preventing the illegal Importation of foreign Cambricks and French Lawns: And whereas a Manufactory of Cambricks and Lawns hath been already set up at Winchelsea in the County of Sussex, and large Quantities of such Goods have been made there, and may be made in other Parts of this Kingdom, equal, if not superior, in Quality to those made in foreign Parts; and many Persons are desirous of subscribing large Sums towards the Support and Extension of the said Manufactory (for the effectual carrying on of which a large Fund will be necessary) but are apprehensive that Difficulties may arise, as well in recovering Debts which may grow due to the Proprietors of the said Manufactury, as in defending Suits or Actions which may be brought or commenced against them for any Matter or Thing relative thereto, as by Law, all the several Proprietors or Subscribers to the said Manufactury must, in such Cases, both sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, by their several and distinct Names and Descriptions; and therefore, for the more easily carrying on the Manufacture, and avoiding the Difficulties aforesaid, are desirous of being incorporated, and having a common Seal and Name by which they may sue and be sued; and many Persons are desirous of subscribing large Sums thereto, but are deterred from so doing, lest they may thereby become liable, in case the said Manufactury should not be successful, to pay large Sums of Money over and above the Sums by them subscribed, to make good the Debts to be incurred therefrom; and many Persons who are not now liable to become Bankrupts, within the Intent and Meaning of any of the Laws now in Force concerning Bankrupts, are likewise fearful of subscribing Money to carry on the said Manufacture, as, by becoming Subscribers to and Part-Owners thereof, they may be liable to have Commissions of Bankrupt issued against them as Traders: And whereas some Doubts have arisen, whether such Cambricks and Lawns, so made and fabricated in England, can, consistent with the Laws now in being relating to Cambricks and French Lawns, be legally sold, disposed of and used in Great Britain; May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same,

[Any Person may make and sell Cambricks and Lawns in this Kingdom.]

That it shall and may be lawful to and for any Person or Persons whomsoever, to make and vend, or cause to be made and vended, all such Linen and sell Cambricks and Goods called Cambricks or Lawns, or Goods of the Kind usually known under either of those Denominations, as shall be made in this Kingdom, and stamped in the Manner herein after directed; and that such Lawns or Cambricks, or other such like Goods so made and stamped, may be exposed to Sale, and worn by any Person or Persons in this Kingdom; any Law, Usage or Custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.

against certain persons, named Tinners in the County aforesaid, for the reformation of the perishing,

hurting, and destroying of diverse Ports, Hauens, and Creeks, and other bils for the common weale or the said County, the which herein this high Court of Parliament Should and ought to be communed and treated of.

And for because the said Richard is a Tinner, for the causes & afore rehearsed, one lohn Furfe Tinner. under steward of the Steimerie in the said county, in & at foure Courts of tyre said Steimerie at diverse places and times before him feuerally held in the said. County, he and other have condemned the said Richard in the sum of one hundred and threescore poundes: that, is to wit, at euery Court day forty poundes, and by the procurement of the said lohn Furfe, at the said foure feuerall Courts and Lawdaies, in the said Steimerie, by him held, in this manner published and said, that tyre

same Richard at the last Parliament held at Westminster, would have auoided and vtterly destroyed all liberties, priuileges, and franchises concerning the Steimerie: by reason whereof the said Richard,

upon foure bils had and made thereof by the said lohn Furfe and other, caused that the said Richard.

and the said lohn Agwilliam seeing the same cruell imprisonment of the said Richard, entreated and instantly desired one Philip Furfe (then being keeper of the said prison) streidlly to keep the said Ri

chard in prison, and to put irons upon him to his more greater paine and ieopardie, and to giue him but bread and water onley, to the intent to cause the said Richard to be faine to content and pay him the said twentie poundes. And for the same promised the said keeper foure Markes of Money: for the

CAP. XX.

An at concerning Restraint of Payment of Annates to the See of Rome.

FORASMUCH as it is well perceived, by long approved experience, that great and inestimable Sums of Money have been daily conveyed out of this Realm, to the impoverishment of the

A. same; and especially such Sums of Money as the pope's Holiness, his Predecessors, and the Court of Rome, by long time have heretofore taken of all and singular those Spiritual Persons which have been Named, Elected, Presented, or Postulated to be Archbishops or Bishops within this Realm of England, under the Title of Annates, otherwise called First fruits. Which Annates, or First fruits

been taken of every Archbishopric, or Bishopric, within this Realm, by restraint of the pope's ' Bulls, for Confirmations, Elections, Admissions, Postulations, Provisions, Collations, Dispositions, ' Institutions, Installations, Investitures, Orders, Holy Benedictions, Palles, or other things reejuifite

and necessary to the attaining of those their Promotions; and have been compelled to pay, before they

could attain the same, great Sums of Money, before they might receive any part of the Fruit of the said Archbishoprick, or Bishopric, whereunto they were named, elected, presented, or populated; by

occasion whereof, not only the Treasure of this Realm hath been greatly conveighed out of the same,

but also it hath happened many times, by occasion of Death, unto such Archbishops, and Bishops

newly promoted, within two or three years after his or their Consecration, that his or their Friends, ' by whom he or they have been holpen to advance and make paiment of the said Annates, or First fruits, ' have been thereby utterly undone and impoverished. And for because the said Annates have risen

and increased, by an uncharitable Custom, grounded upon no just or good title, and the pai

ments thereof obtained by restraint of Bulls, until the fain & Annates, or First fruits, have been paid, ' or Surety made for the lame; which declareth the said Payments to be exacted, and taken by constraint, ' against all equity and justice. The Noble Men therefore of the Realm, and the wife, sage, politic Commons of the same, assembled in this present Parliament, considering that the Court of Rome

ceafeth not to tax, take, and exact the said great Sums of Money, under the Title of Annates, or First Fruits, as is aforesaid, to the great damage of the said Prelates, and this Realm; which Annates, or First fruits, were first suffered to be taken within the same Realm, for the only defence of Christian

against the Infidels, and now they be claimed and demanded as mere duty, only for lucre,

against all right and confidence. Insomuch that it is evidently known, that there hath passed out of this Realm unto the Court of Rome, lithen the second year of the Reign of the moil Noble i Prince, of famous memory, King Henry the Seventh, unto this present time, under the name of An act' nates, or First fruits, paid for the expedition of Bulls of Archbishopricks and Bishopricks, the sum of eight hundred thousand Ducats, amounting in Sterling Money, at the least, to eightfeore thousand pounds,

besides other great and intolerable Sums which have yearly been conveighed to the said Court of Rome,

by many other ways and means, to the great impoverishment of this Realm. And albeit, that our said Sovereign the King, and all his natural Subjects, as well Spiritual as 1 emporal, been as obedient,

devout, Ca holick and humble Children of God, and Holy Church, as any People be within any Realm christned; yet the said exactions of Annates, or First fruits, be so intolerable and importable to this Realm, that it is considered and declared, by the whole Body of this Realm now represented by all the Estates of the same assembled in this present Parliament, that the King's Highness, before Al ' mighty God, is bound, as by the duty cf a good Christian Prince, for the conserv. tion and preservation ' of the good Estate and commonwealth of this his Realm, to do all that in him is to obviate, repress,

and redress the said abufions and exactions of Annates, or First fruits. And because that diverse Pre ' lates of this Realm, being now in extreme Age, and in other debilities of their Bodies, so that of likelihood, bodily death in short time shall or may succeed unto them; by reason whereof great, sums

of Money shall shortly after their deaths, be conveighed unto the Court of Rome, for the unreason _ ' and uncharitable Causes sbovesaid, to the universal damage, prejudice, and impoverishment of this Realm, if speedy remedy be not in due time provided: '

II It is therefore ordained, estab.ished, and e.iaded, by Authority of this present Parliament,. That the unlawful paiment of Annates, or First fruits, and all manner Contributions for the same, for any Archbishoprick, or Bishopric, or for any Bulls hereafter to be obtained from the Court of Rome, to or for the aforesaid purpose and intent, lhah from henceforth utterly ceafi, and no such hereafter to be, paid for any Archbishoprick, or Bifiioprick, within ths Realm, other or otherwise than hereafter in this present Act is declared; And that no manner person. nor persons hereafter to be named, elected, presented, postulated to any Archbishoprick, or billiopr.ck, within this Realm, shall pay the'laid. Annates, or First fruits, for the said Atclibilheprick, or Bifiioprick, nor any other manner of Sum or, Sums of Money, Pennons or ann, tes for the same, or for any other like exadion, or cause, upon pain to forfeit to our said Sovereign Lord the -- King, his Heirs and Successors, all manner his Goods and chattels for ever, and all the i emporal Lands and Posselfi jns of the same Archbishoprick, or Bifiioprick, during the time that he or they which shall offend, contrary to this present Act, shall have, poflds, or enjoy, the Archbishoprick, or Bishopric, wherefore he shall so offend contrary to the form aforesaid. And furthermore it is enabled, by Authority of this present Parliament, That if any Person hereafter: named and presented to the Court of Rome by the King, or any of his Heirs or Successors, to be Bi

113 APPENDIX.

hop of any See or Diocese within this Realm hereafter, shall be letted, deferred, or delayed at the Court of Rome from any such Bishopric, whereunto he shall be so represented, by means of restraint of Bulls Apostolic, and other things requisite to the same; or shall be denied, at the court of Rome, upon convenient suit made, any manner Bulls requisite for any of the Causes aforesaid, any, such person or persons so presented, may be, and (half be, consecrated here in England by the Archbishop, in whose province the said Bishopric shall be, so always that the same person shall be named and presented by the King for the time being to the same Archbishop: if any persons being named and presented, as aforesaid, to any Archbishoprick of this Realm, making convenient suit, as is aforesaid, shall happen to be letted, deferred, delayed, or otherwise disturbed from the same Archbishoprick, for lack of Pall, Bulls, or other to him requisite, to be obtained in the Court of Rome in that behalf, that then every such person named and presented to be Archbishop, may be, and shall be, consecrated and invested, after presentation made, as is aforesaid. any other two Bishops within this Realm, whom the King's Highness, or any of his Heirs or Successors, Kings of england.for the time being, will assign and appoint for the same, according and in like manner as diverse other Archbishops and Bishops have been heretofore, in ancient time, by sundry the King's most noble Progenitors, made, consecrated, and invested within this Realm: And that every Archbishop and Bishop hereafter, being named and presented by the King's Highness, his Heirs or Successors, Kings of England, and being, consecrated and invested, as is aforesaid, shall be installed accordingly, and shall be accepted, taken, reputed, used, and obeyed, as an Archbishop or Billtop of the Dignity, See or Place whereunto he lb shall be named, presented, consecrated, requireth; and as other like Prelates of that Province, See, or Diocese, have been used, accepted, taken, and obeyed, which have had, and obtained completely, their Bulls, and other things requisite in that behalf from the Court of Rome. And also shall fully and entirely have and enjoy all the Spiritualities and Temporalities of the said Archbishoprick, or Bishopric, in as large, ample, and beneficial manner, as any of his or their predecessors had, or enjoyed in the said Archbishoprick, or Bishopric, satisfying and yielding unto the King our Sovereign Lord, and to his Heirs and Successors Kings of Englandall such Duties, Rights and Interests, as before this time had been accustomed to be paid for any such Archbishoprick, or Bishopric, according to the Ancient Laws and Customs of this Realm, and the King's prerogative Royal.

III. And to the intent our said Holy Father the Pope, and the Court of Rome, shall not think that the pains and labours taken, and hereafter to be taken, about the writing, sealing, obtaining, and other businesses sustained, and hereafter to be sustained, by the Offices of the said Court of Rome, for and about the Expedition of any Bulls hereafter to be obtained or had for any such Archbishoprick,

or Bishopric, shall be irremunerated, or shall not be sufficiently and condignly recompensed in that behalf; and for their more ready expedition to be had therein.' It is therefore enabled by the Authority aforesaid, That every Spiritual Person of this Realm, hereafter to be named, presented, or poflula ted, to any Archbishoprick or Bishopric of this Realm, shall and may lawfully pay for the writing and obtaining of his or their said Bulls, at the Court of Rome, and enfealing the same with Lead, to be had without payment of any Annates, or First fruits, or other charge or exaftian by him or them to be made, yielded, or pared for the same, five pounds Sterling, for and after the rate of the clear and whole yearly value of every hundred pounds Sterling, above all charges of any such Archbishoprick, or Bishopric, or other Money, to the value of the said five pounds, for the clear yearly value of every hun dreth pounds of every such Archbishoprick, or Bishopric, and not above, nor in any otherwise, any thin" in this present Act before written notwithstanding. And forasmuch as the King's Highness, and this his High Court of Parliament, neither have, nor do intend to ule in this, or any other like cause. manner of extremity or violence, before gentle courtefieor friendship, ways and means first approved and attempted, and without a very great urgent cause and occasion given to the contrary, but principally coveting to disburden this Realm of the said great exactions, and intolerable charges of Annates and First fruits., have therefore thought convenient to commit the final order and determination of the premisses, in ah things, Unto the King's Highness. So that if it may seem to h's high Wisdom, and mull prudent Discretion, meet to move the pope's Holiness, and the Court of Rome, amicably, charitably, and reasonably, to compound, other to extinct and make frustrate the payments of the said Annates, or First fruits, or else by some friendly, loving, and tolerable composition to moderate the same in such wise as may be by this Realm easily born and sustained; That then those ways and compositions once taken, concluded, and agreed, between the pope's Holiness and the King's Highness, shall stand in ftrngth, force, and effect of Law, inviolably to be observed. And it is also further ordained, and ehadted by the Authority of this present Parliament, That the King's Highness at any time, or times, on th' s side the Feast of Easter, which shall be in the Year of our Lord God, a thousand five hundred and three and thirty, or at any tune on this side the beginning of the next Parliament, by his Letters Patents under his Great Seal, to be made, and to be entered of Record in the Roll of this present Parliament, may and shall have full power and liberty to declare, by the said Letters Patents, whether that the premisses, or any part, clause, or matter thereof, shall be observed, obeyed, executed, and take place and eft eft, as an Act and Statute of this present parliament, or not. So that if his Highness, by his said Letters Patents, before the expiration of the times above limited, thereby do declare his pleasure to be. That the Premisses, or any part, clause, or matter thereof, lnall not be put in execution, observed, continued, nor obeyed, in that case all the said premisses, or fuih part, dame, or matter, as the King's H gliness so shall refute, disafftnn, or not ratifie, shall stand and be from henceforth utterly void and of none effect. And in case that the King's Highness, before the expiration of the times afore prefixed, do declare by his said Letters Patents, his pleasure and determination to be, that the said premises, or every clause, sentence, and part thereof, that is to say, the whole, or such part thereof as the

APPENDIX

king's Highness so shall affirm, accept, and ratified shall hi all points stand, remain, abide, and be put in due and effectual execution, according to the import, tenor, effect, and true meaning of the lame; and to Hand and be from henceforth for ever after, as firm, steadfast, and available in the Law, as the same had been fully and perfectly established, enacted, and confirmed, to be in every part thereof, immediately, wholly, and entirely executed, in like manner, dorm, and effect, as other Acts and Laws; The which being fully and determinately made, ordained, and enacted in this present Parliament: And if that upon the aforesaid reasonable, amicable, and charitable ways and means, by the King's Highness to be experimented, moved, or qciiiipounded, or otherwise approved, it: shall and may appear, or; be seen unto his Grace, that this Realm shall be continually burdened and charged with this, and such other intolerable Exactions and Demands, as heretofore it hath been. And that thereupon, for continuance of the same, our said Holy Father the Pope, or any of his Successors, or the Court of Rome, will, or do, or cause to be done at any time hereafter, so as is above rehearsed, unjustly, uncharitably, and unreasonably vex, inquiet, molest, trouble, or grieve our said Sovereign Lord, his Heirs or successors, Kings or England, or any of his or their Spiritual or Lay subjects, or this his Realm, by ex communication, Excomengement, Interdiction; or by any other Process, Censures, Compulfories, Ways or Means; Be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the King's Highness, his Heirs and Successors, Kings of England, and all his Spiritual and Lay subjects of the same, without any scruples of Confidence, shall and mayjawfully, to the honour of Almighty God, the increase and continuance of virtue and good example within this Realm, the said Censures, Excommunications, Interdictions, Compulfories, or any of them notwithstanding, minister, or cause to be miniltered, throughout this said Realm, and all other the Dominions or Territories belonging or appertaining thereunto: All and all manner of Sacraments, Sacramentals, Ceremonies, or other divine Services of the Holy Church, or any other thing or things necessary for the health of the Soul of Mankind, as they heretofore at any time or times have been vertuously used or accustomed to do within the same; and that no manner such Censures, Excommunications, Interdictions, or any other process or compulsories, shall be by any of the Prelates, or other Spiritual Fathers of this Region, nor by any of their a/iiniflers or Substitutes, beat any time or times hereafter published, executed, nor divulged, nor suffered to be published, executed, or divulged in any manner of ways.

and ouer this moll dread Soueraigne Lord, albeit that your Majesty not knowing of any vnlawfull im 1 pediments, entered into the bonds of the said vnlawfull marriage, and aduanced the same Lady Anne to the honour of the foueraigne estate of the Queen of this Realm: yet neuertheleffe file inflamed with pride and carnall desires of her body, putting appart the dread of God and excellent benefits re ceiued of your highnes, confederated herself with George Bullen late Lord Rockford her naturall bro there, Henry Norrcis Esquier, Francis tveston Knight, William Brereton Esquier, Gentleman of your priuie chamber, and Marie Smetcn Grome of your said prime chamber, and so being confederate, ihe and they most traitorously committed and perpetrated diverse dettstable and abhominable treasons, to the most fearelull perill and danger of the destruction of your most royall person, and to the vtter lolle,

vs your Nobles & Commons, assembled in this present Parliament, afwell for the clere extinguidiment of all ambiguities & doubts, as for a pure and perfect vnitie of vs your most humble and obedient fub iciffs, and of all our posterities, that rt may bee enacted by your most gratious and royall Majesty, by consent of vs the Lords spirituall and temporall, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by authoritie of the same in manner and form as hereafter in articles infueth.

VII First, forasmuch as the marriage heretofore solemnised between your highnesse and the said Lady Katherine Princes Dowager deceased, which afore was lawful wife to your naturall brother Prince Arthur, and by him carnally knowen, as hath duly been prooued by sufficient witnesses, at all times

was, is, and ought to bee deemed and determined to be against the laws of almighty God, & not dispensable by any humaine authoritie, & so hath been deemed and determined, alwell by the whole Clergic of this Realm, in both Conuocations, and by both the Vniueriities thereof, as by the Vniuer iities of Bononie, Padua, Paris, Orleance, Tolouze, Aniou, and diverse other, and also by a great number of priuate writings of many right excellent well learned men Bee it therefore enacted by authoritie of this present Parliament, according as it was ordeined and enacted in the said Act made in the last Parliament for the establishment of your succession, that the said marriage heretofore had and solemnised between your highnefic and the said Lady Katherine, which was before lawful wife to the said Prince Arthur your elder brother, and by him carnally knowen, as doeth duly appear by sufficient proofe in a lawful proces had and made before the said most reuerend father in God Thomas, by the i'ufferance of God, Archbishop of Canterbury, metropolitan and primat of all England, shall be by authoritie of this present Parlament definitiuely, cleerely and absolutely declared, deemed and adjudged to be against the laws of almighty God, and also accepted, reputed and taken of no value nor effect, but vtterly voyd and adnihiled: and that the separation thereof made by the said Archbishop shall be good and effectuall to all intents and purposes, any licence, dispensation, or any other Actor Actes, going before and infuing the same, to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding. And that euery such licence, di pensation, Act or Acts, thing or things, had, made, done or to be done to the contrary thereof, shall be to all intents void and of none effect, and so shall be reputed and taken by and amongst all vs your true subjects and inhabitants, our Heires and successours of and in your Realm and dominions for ever. And that the issue born and procreated under the same vnlawfull marriage, made and solemnised between your highnesse and the said Lady Katherine, shall be taken, deemed, and accepted illegitimat to all intents and purposes, and shall be vtterly foreclosed, excluded, and barred, to ciaime, chalenge, or demand any inheritance as lawful heire to your highnesse by lineall defeent.

VIII. And also forasmuch as the marriage solemnised between your highnesse and the said late Queen Anne, upon true and iuft causes, was and is deemed and adjudged by the said most reuerend father, to bee of no value nor effect, and a diuorce and separation thereof had and made, by the due order and proceffe of the laws of the Church of England before the said reuerend Father Be it therefore enacted by the authority of this present Parliament, that the same marriage between your highnesse and the said late Queen Anne, shall be taken, reputed, deemed and adjudged to be of no force, strength, virtue nor effect, and that the separation and diuorce thereof had by the sentence and judgement of the said most reuerend father, shall be good and effectuall, and so hereafter shall be taken and reputed for euer by all your subjects, their heires and successors. And that none appease, repeale, reuocation or adnullation thereof, or any part of the same, shall hereafter be had, taken, allowed or ad ztiitted in any behalfe. And that all the issues & born and procreated under the same marriage, between your highnesse and the said late Queen Anne, shall be taken, reputed and accepted to be illegitimate to all intents and purposes, and utterly foreclosed, excluded, and barred to ciaime, challenge, or demand any inheritance as lawful heire or heires to your highnes by lineal! defeent, the said former Act made in the last Parliament, for the establishment of your succession, or anything therein conteined, or anything or things to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

IX. And furthermore since many inconueniences have fallen, as well within this Realm as in others,

by reason of the marrying within the degrees of marriage prohibited by Gods laws, that is to say,

the sun to marry the mother, or the stepmother carnally knowne by his father, the brother the filler, the father his fons daughter, or his daughters daughter: or the son to marry the daughter of his father procreat & born by his stepmother: or the son to marry his aunt, being his fathers or mothers filler: or to marry his vncles wise carnally knowne by his vncle: or the father to marry his

sons wise carnally knowne by his son: the brother to marry his brothers wife carnally knowne 6 by his brother: or any man married, and carnally knowing his wife, to marry his wives daughter, ' or his wives sons daughter, or his wives daughters daughter, or his wives lifter.'

X. And further to dilate and declare the meaning of these prohibitions, it is to be understood, that if it chance any man to know carnally any woman, that then all and singular persons, being in any

degree of consanguinity or affinitie, as is aboue written, to any of the parties so carnally offending,

shall be deemed and adjudged to be within the cases and limits of the said prohibitions of marriage. ' All which marriages albeit they bee plainely prohibited and detested by the laws of God, yet neuer theleffe at fornetimea they have proceeded under colours of dispensations by mans power, which is but vfurped, and of right ought not to be granted, admitted, nor allowed.' For no man of what estate, degree, or condition foeuer he be, hath power to dispense with Gods laws, as all the Clergy of this Realm in the said eonuocations, and the most part of all the Vniueriities of Christendome, and we also doe affirme and thinke.' _ _.

XI. Be it therefore enacted by authority aforesaid, according as it is declared and conteined in the said Act, made in the last Parliament for the establishment of your succession, that no person or persons, subjects, or reliants of this Realm, or in any your dominions, of what estate, degree or dignity

foeuer they be, shall from henceforth marry within the degrees afore rehearsed, what' pretence foeuer shall bee made to the contrary thereof. And in case any person or persons, of what eiiate, dignity, decree or condition foeuer they bee, that be heeretofore married within this Realm, or in any other, the Rings dominions, within any the degrees aboue rehearsed, and by any the Archbishops or ministers of the Church of England bee separate from the bonds of such vnlawful marriages: that then euery such separation shall be good, lawful, firme and permanent for ever, and not by any power, authoritie or means to be reuoked or vndone hereafter. And that the children proceeding or procrcat under such vnlawfull marriage, shall not bee lawful nor legitimate: Any forren laws, licences, dispensations, or other thing or things to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.

XII. And that in case there be any person or persons within this Realm, orin any the Kings' dominions already maried within any of the said degrees aboue specified, and not yet separate from the bonds of such vnlawfull marriage, that then euery liich person so vnlawfully maried, shall be separate, by the definitiue sentence and judgements of the Archbishops, Bishops, and other ministers of the Church of England, and in other your dominions, within the limits of their jurisdictions and authorities and by none other power or authority. And that all sentences and judgements giuen and to be giuen by any Archbishop, bishop, or other minister of the Church of England, or in any other the Kings dominions, within the limits of their jurisdictions and authoritie, shall be definitiue, firme, good, and effectuall to all intents, and be obferued and obeyed, without suing any prouocations, appeals, prohibitions, or other proceffe from or to the Court of Rome, to the derogation thereof, contrary to the Act made fithence the beginning of the last Parliament for restraint of such prouocations, appeals, prohibitions and other processes.

XIII. And also be it enacted by authority aforesaid, that all the blue hereafter to bee had and pro create between your highnes, and your said moll dear and entirely beloued lawful wife Queen lane, shall be your lawful children and heires, and be inheritable and inherite, according to the course of inheritance and laws of this Realm, the imperiall crown of the same, with all dignities, honours, pre heminences, prerogatiues, authorities and jurisdictions, to the same annexed or belonging, in as large and ample manner, as your highnesse at this present time hath the same as King of this Realm, the inheritance thereof to be and remaine to your said children and right heires in manner and form as hereafter shall be declared, that is to say. First, the said imperiall Crown and other the premisses, shall bee to your majesty and to your heires of your body lawfully begotten, that is to say, To the first son of your body between your highnes and your said lawful] wife Queen lane begotten, and to the heires of the body of the same first son lawfully begotten. And for the default of such heires, then to the second son of your body, and of the body of the said Queen lane begotten, and to the heires of the body of the same second son lawfully begotten, as aforesaid, and so to euery son of your body, and of the body of the said Queen lane begotten, and to the heires of the body of euery such son begotten, according to the course of inheritance in that behalfe.

XIV. And if it shall happen your said most dear and entirely beloued wife Queen lane, to decease without issue male of the body of your highnes to be begotten (which God defend) then the same imperiall Crown, and all other the premisses to be to your majesty, as is aforesaid, and to the son and heire male of your body lawfully begotten by any other lawful wife, and to the heires of the body of the same son and heire male lawfully begotten: and for default of such issue, then to your second son of your body lawfully begotten, and to the heires of the body of the same second son lawfully begotten: and so from son and heire male, to son and heire male, and to the heires of the feuerall bodies of euery such son and heire male lawfully begotten, according to the course of inheritance, in like manner and form, as is abouesaid.

XV. And for default of such sons of your body lawfully begotten, and of the heires of the feuerall bodies of euery such son lawfully begotten, that then the said imperiall Crown, and other the premisses, shall be to the issue female between your majesty and your said most dear and entirely beloued wife Queen lane begotten: And for lacke of such issue, then to the heires females of your body lawfully. begotten by any other lawful wife: that is to say, First to the eldest issue female, and to the heires of her body lawfully egotten, and lb from issue female to issue female, and to their heirs of their bodies one after another by course of inheritance according to their ages, as the Crown of England hath been accustomed and ought to succeed and go, in case when there is heire female inheritable to the same.

XVI. And for as much as it standeth at this present time in the only pleasure and will of almighty God, whether your majesty shall have heires begotten and procreated between your highnesse, and

your said most dear and entirely beloued wife Queen lane, or else any lawful heires and issues here after of your own body begotten by any other lawful wife, and if such heires should fade, as God ' defend, and no prouilion made in your life, who should rule and gouerne this Realm for lacke of

such heires, that then this Realm after your transttory life shall be destitute of a lawful gouernour

or elfepercafe incumbred with such a person, that would couet to aspire to the same, whom the fub ieefts of this Realm shall not find in their hearts to loue, dread, and obediently ferue as their so uereigne Lord. And if your grace afore it may be certainely knowne, whether ye shall have heires

or no should suddenly name & declare any person or persons to succeed after your decease, and for lack of heirs of your body lawfully begotten, into the royall estate of the imperiall Crown of this Realm r ' then it is to be doubted, that such person that should bee so named, might happen to take great heart

and courage, and by presumption fall to inobedience and rebellion: by occasion of which premisses,

great diuifton and difcention may bee and is very likely to arise & in this Realm, to the great peril and destruction of vs your most humble & obedient subjects, and of all our posterities, if remedy

to be in like manner assembled.

II. And forasmuch as in the said Parliament, synod and conuocation, there were certain Articles, ' matters and questions proponed and set forth touching christian religion, that is to say,

First, Whether in the most blessed Sacrament of the Altar remaineth after the consecration, the fubfance of Bread and Wine, or no.

Secondly, Whether it be neccessary by Gods law, that all men Should communicat with both kinds, or no.

III The Kings most royall majesty, most prudenly pondering and considering, that by occasion of £ variable and sundry opinions and judgements of the said Articles, great difeord and variance hatharifen,

as well amongst the Cleargie of this his Realm, as amongst a great number of the vulgar people, his £ louing subjects of the same: and being in a full hope and trust, that a full and perfect resolution of the said Articles, should make .3 perfect concord and ynitie generally amongst all his louing and obedient fub iedts, of his most excellent goodnesse not only commanded, that the said Articles should deliberately,

£ and aduifedly, by his said Archbishops, Bishops, and other learned men of his Cleargie, be debated,

argued and reasoned, and their opinions therein to be understood, declared and knowne, but also most £ vpuchfafed in his own Princely person, to defeend and come vnto his said high court of

Parliament and counsel & like a Prince of most high prudence, and no leste learning, opened £ and declared many things of high learning and great knowledge, touching the said articles, matters 1 & questio's for an vnity to be had in the same: Wherupo' after a great & long deliberat & aduifed dif putatio' & co fultatio' had and made concerning the said Articles, afwell by the consent of the Kings e highnesse, as by the assent of the Lords spirituall and Temporall, and other learned men of his Cler gie in their Conuocations, and by the consent of the Commons in this present parliament assembled,

it was and is Anally refolued, accorded and agreed in manner and form following, that is to say,

First, That in the moji blessed Sacrament of the Altar, by the frength and efficacie of chruls mighty word (it being spoken by the Priejl) is present really under the form of bread and wine, the naturall body and blood of our Sauiour Iefu Christ, concerned of the Virgin Mary: and that after the eonfccration there remaineth no fub jiauce of Bread or Wine, nor any other subilance, but the substance of Christ, God and man.

Secondly, That the Communion in both kinds is not necessary Ad lalutem by the law of God to all persons: and that it is to be bcleeued and riot doubted of, but that in the Jteth under the form of bread, is the very blood, and with the blood under form of wine, is the very fiejl> as swell apart as though they were both together.

Thirdly, That Priejls, after the order of Priesthood reteiued, as afore, may not marrie by the law of God.

Fourthly, That vowes of chafitie, zvidozvhead, by man or woman made to God aduifedly, ought to be ob firmed by the lazy of God: and that it exempteth them from other liberties of Christian people, which without that they might enjoy.

Fiftly, That this is mete and tiecessary, that private Majfes be continued and admitted in it the Kings eug lift] Church and Congregation, as whereby good Christian Jeople, ordering the mfclues accordingly, do receive both godly and goodly conflations and benefits: and it is agreeable also to Gods lazy.

CAP. XXIV.

An Act concerning the lands and goods of the hospitals of S. Johns of Ierufalem in England and Ireland to be heereafter in the Kings hands and disposition.

THE Lords spirituall and temporall and the commons in this present Parliament assembled, hauing credible knowledge that diverse & the Kings subjects called Knights of the Rhodes, otherwise called knights of Saint Iohns, otherwise called Friars of the religion of Saint John of Ierufalem in England, and ot a like house being in Ireland, abiding in he parts of beyond the Sea, and hauing as well out of this Reaime as out of Ireland and other the Kings dominions, yeerely great sums of money for maintenance of their liuings, have vnnaturally and contrary to the dutie of their allegiances, fufteined and maintained the vfurped power and authoritie of the Bishop of Rome lately used and practised within this reaime and other the Kings dominions, and have not only adhered themselves to the said Bishop being common enemy to the King our Soueraigne Lord, and to this his reaime vntruly upholding, acknowledging and affirming maliciously and traitorously, the same Bishop to be fupreame and chief head of Christs Church by Gods holy word, intending thereby to fubveit and ouerthrow the good and godly laws and statutes of this reaime their naturall country, made and grounded by authority of holy Church by the most excellent wisdom, policy and goodnes of the kings majesty with the whole aflfent and consent of the reaime, for the abolishing, expulsing & vtter extinffing of the said vfurped power and authoritie, but also have defamed and llandered as well the Kings majesty as the noble men, Prelats and other the Kings true and louing Subjects of this reaime,

for their good and godly proceeding in that behalfe, have therefore deepely pondered and considered that like as it is and was a most godly Act of the Kings most royal! majesty, and the said Noble men,

Prelats, and Commons of this reaime, vtterly to expulse and abolish not only from this reaime, but also from other the Kings dominions the said vfurped power and authority of the Bishop of Rome,

and also the hypocri tike and superstitious religions in this Reaime, and other the Kings dominions being his members and adherents hauing their originall erection and foundation by the said vfurped authoride, by expulsing whereof Gods holy word necessary for increase of virtue and faluation of christian foules, is not only purely and sincerely aduanced and set foorth, but also the extort exadlions of innumerable summes of money, caftily exhausted out of this reaime and of other the Kings dominions, by the colour of the said vfurped authoritie is removed and taken away, to the inestimable benefit and commoditie of the Kings louing subjects, foin like manner of wise it should be most dangerous to be suffered or permitted within this reaime or in any other the kings dominions, any religion being sparks, leaues, and imps of the said root of iniquity, considering also that the Isle of Rhodes, whereby the said religion took their old name and foundation is furpifed by the Turke.

II. And that it were and is much better that the possessions in this reaime, and in other the Kings dominions appertaining to the said religion, should rather be employed and spent within this reaime, and in other the Kings dominions, for the defence and sureties of the same, then conuerted to & among such vnnaturall subjects which have declined not only from their naturall dutie of obedience, that they ought to bear vnto the King their foueraigne Lord, but also from the good laws and Statutes of this reaime, their naturall country, daily doing and attempting priuily, and craftily all that they can to fubuert the good and godly policy, in the which thanks be to God and to our most dread foueraigne Lord, this reaime and all other the Kings dominions now stand in: 'In consideration whereof, the said Lords spirituall and temporall, and the commons in this present Parliament assembled, most humbly beseeche the Kings most royal! Majesty, that it may be enacted by his highnes and by the assent of the Lords spirituall and temporall and tile commons in this present Parliament assembled, that the corpo c°rpcrst; oration of the said religion, as well within this reaime, as within the Kings dominions and land of Ire lffove land, by whatsoever name or names they bee sounded, incorporated or knowne, shall be vtterly diffolued and void to all intents and purposes. And that sir William Weston Knight, now being Prior of the said religion within this reaime of England, shall not be named or called from hencefoorth Prior of S. Iohns of of Ierufalem in England, but shall be called by his proper name of William Weston Knight, without further addition touching the said religion.

AN Act made in the second Session of the Parliament held at Westminster, upon prorogation the 24. day of Oblober, in the first yeere of the reigne of Queen Mary, late Queen of England, C And there continued and kept to the difiolution of the same, being the fixed day of December, then next ensuing, as followeth.

CAP. I.

An act declaring the Queenes highnefie to have bene born in a most iuft and lawful matri monie, and also repealing all Acts of Parliament, and sentences of Diuorfe had and made to the contrary.

FORASMUCH as Trueth (being of her own nature of a most excellent virtue, efficacie, force and working) cannot but by procefie of time breake out and shew herself, hofoeuer for a while

JL (he may by the iniquity and frailty of man be suppressed and kept close: and being reuealed and manifeded, ought to be imbraced, acknowledged, confessed and professed in all cases and matters whatsoeuer, and whomsoever they touch or concerne, without respect of persons, but in such cases and matters specially, as whereby the glory and honour of God in heauen (who is the author of trueth it Rise) is to be specially set forth, and whereby also the honour, dignity, surety and preferuation of the Prince, and ruler under God in earth dependeth, and the welfare, profit and speciall benefit of the vniuerfall people, and body of a Realm is to be continued and mainteined.

4 II We your highnefie moftlouing, faithful and obedient Subjects, understanding the very trueth of the (late of Matrimonie between the two most excellent princes of most worthy memory King Henry the eight and Queen Katherine, his louing godly and lawful] wise, your highnefie lawful! father and mother, cannot but think our self most bounden, both by our duetie of allegiance to your Ma 4 iedie, and of conscience towards God, to shew vnto your highnefie fird how that the same Matrimonie being contracted, solemnised and consummated, by the agreement and assent of both their most noble parents, by the counsell and aduife of the most wife and graued men of both their Realmes, by the deli berate and mature consideration and consent of the bed and most notable men in learning in those days of Chrifiendome, did euen so continue by the space of twentie yeeres and more between them, to the pleasure of Almighty God, and satisfaction of the world, the ioy and comfort of all the Sub 4 ie&s of this Realm, and to their own repose and good contentment, God giuing for a sure token and tedimonie of his good acceptation of the same, not only godly fruit, your highnefie most noble person (whom we beseech the Almighty and euerliuing God, long to prosper and preferue here amongd 4 vs) and other issue also, whom it hath pleased God to take out of this transitorie life, vnto his eternal] 4 glory, but also sending vs a happy flouridling and most prosperous common wealth in all things: and then afterward, how that the malitious and peruerfe affections of same (a very few persons) enuying the great felicitie, wherein by the goodnesse of God your said most noble father and mother, and all their good Subjects hued and continued in many yeres, did for their own Angular glory, and vain 4- reputation conceiue sundry subtle and diiloyall practises, for the interruption and breach of the said most lawful] and godly concord. And trauelling to put the same in vre, deuifed lirlt to infinuat a 4 scruple into the King your fathers conscience, of an vnlawfull marriage between him and his most lawtull wife the Queen, your highnefie mother, pretending for the ground thereof, that the same was against the word of God, and thereupon ceased not to persuade continually vnto the said King your father, that he could not without danger of the lofic of his soul, continue with his said moil lawful wife, but mud be separated and diuorfetl from her. And to this intent caused the feales, as well of certain Universities in Italy and France, to begotten (as it were for a testimony) by the cor ruption with money of a few light persons, lcolers of the same Universities, as also the feales of the Universities of this Realm to bee obteined by great trauell, (underworking, secret threatenings, and

149

APPENDIX

intreatings of some men of authoritie, specially sent at that time thither for the same purposes, and

how that finally Thomas Cranmer then newly made Archbishop of Canterburie, most vngodly and against all Laws, equitie and conscience, prosecuting the said wicked deuife of diuorfe, and reparation

of the said King your father, and Queen your mother, called before him ex officio, the hearing of

the said matter of marriage, and taking his foundation partly vpcn his own, vnaduifed iudgment of the Scripture, ioyning therewith the pretended testimonies of the said Universities, and partly upon bare and moult vntrue coniedtures, gathered and admitted by him upon matters of.no strength oreffedl, but

only by supposal, apd. without admitting or hearing arty, thing, that could be said by the Queen your mother, or by any other on her behalfe, in the absence of the said late Queen your mother, pro ceeded, pronounced, discerned, declared and gaue sentence the same most lawful and vndoubted ma t trimonie to bee nought, and to be contracted against Gods Law, and of no value, but lacking the

strength of the Law. And the said most noble King your father, and the said noble Queen your mo there so maried together, did separat and diuorfe, and the same your most noble father King. Henry the eight, and the said noble Queen your mother, from the bands of the same most lawful matri monie, did pronounce and declare by the same his vnlawfull sentence, to be free discharged and set at libertie. Which sentence and judgement so giuen by vnlawfull and corrupt means and wayes, by the said Archbishop of Canturburle, was afterwards upon' certain affections ratified and confirmed by

two feuerall Acts, the one made in the 25. yeere of the reigne of the said King your highnesse fa

and Entitled, An Act declaring the stablishment of the succession of the Kings most royall Ma ' ieftie of the Imperiall Crown of this Realm. The other Act of Parliament made in the 28. yeere of the reigne of the said King your highnesse father, intituled, An Act for the ftablishment of the fuc cefiion of the Imperial Crown of the Realm. In which said two Acts was contained, the illegitima tions of your moll noble person, which your said most noble person being born in so solemne a

marriage, so openly 'approued in the world, 'and with, so good faith both first contracted, and also by

so many yeeres continued between your most noble parents, and the same marriage in very deed not being prohibited by the Law of God, could not by any reason or equitie in this case be so spotted.

And now we your highnesse said most louing, faithful and obedient Subjects, of a godly heart and true "meaning, freely and frankly without fear, fanfie or any other corrupt motion or fenfuall affec tion, considering that this foresaid marriage had his beginning of God, and by him was continued

and therefore was euer and is to be taken for a most true, iuft, lawful! and to all respects a sincere and perfect marriage, nor could nor ought by any mans power, authoritie or jurisdiction, bee dillblued',

broken, or separated for whom God ioyneth, no man can nor ought to put asunder) and considering

how.during the same marriage in godly concord, the Realm in all degrees flourished to the glory of God, the honour of the prince, & the great reputation of the subjects of the same, and on the other side understanding manifestly that the ground of the said deuife, & practice for the diuorfe proceeded first of malice and vainglory, and after was prosecuted and folowed of fond affection & fan tafie, and finally executed and put in efledt by corruption, ignorance and flattery: and feeling to our

great sorrow, damage and regret, how shameful ignominies, rebukes, flariders, contempts, yea, what death, pestilence, warres, disobediences, rebellions, insurrections, and diverse other great and grieuous

plagues, God of his Iuflice hath fentvponvs, euer.since this said viigodly purpose was first begun

and practised, but also seeing euidently before our eyes that vnlefle so great an iniuftice as this hath bin, and yet continueth, be redubbed, and that the said false and wrongrull procefle, judgement and

sentence, with their dependences be repealed and reuoked, nothing is leste' to be doubted, then that greater plagues and strokes are like to increase' and continue daily more and more within this Realm, do beseech your most excellent Majesty, as well in respect of your own honour, dignity and iuft

title, as for truths sake, 'wherewith (we doubt not) but your highnes also will be specially moued in

conscience, and also for the entire loue, fauor & affection which your Majesty beareth to the Commonwealth of this yohr Realm, and for the good peace, vnitie and rest of vs your most bounden

Subjects, and our, posterity, that it may be enacted by your highnes with the consent of the Lords

Spirituall and Temporall, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled.' And be it enacted by the authoritie of this present Parliament, That all and euery decree, sentence and Judgement of diuorfe, and separation between the said King your father, and the said late Queen your mother, and all the procefle commenfed, followed, giuen, made or promulged by the said Thomas Cratimer then Archbishop of Canturburle, or by any other personi or persons whatsoeuer, whereby the same most iuft, pure, and lawfull mariage betwixt the' said late King your father and the said late Queen your mother was or is pronounced, or in any wise declared to be vnlawfull, or vniuft, or against the Law of God, be and fnalbe from the beginning, and from henceforth of no force, vaiiditie or efledt, but be vtterly nought, void, fruftrat" and adnihilat to all intents, constructions and purposes, as if the same had neuer bene giuen cr pronounced.

CAP. XXI.

An act of a Subsidie and two Fifteenes and Tenth, by the Temporaltie.

IIE care which we doe perceiue your Majesty hath, most noble and redoubted Soueraigne, to A reduce this Realm and the imperiall Crown thereof now lately so fore ftiaken, so impouerish, ed, so infeebled and weakened, into the former estate, strength and glory, doth make vs. not only to

reioyce much in the great bounteoufneffe of Almighty God, who hath so marueilously, and beyond all wordly expectation preferued your Majesty in these late difficult and dangerous times, but also to ftudie and bend all our wits and force of understanding, how we may like louing and obedient Subjects, follow our head, in this so noble and so necessary an enterprise. And considering with our felues, that the decay hath been, besides many other things, especially in these three: First, w'acting of treasure, abandoning of strength, and in diminishing of the ancient authoritie of your imperiall f Crowne.

II Wc doe most earnestly and faithfully promise to your highnesse, that there shall lacke no good will, trauell, nor force on our behalfe, to the redresse of all this: but we shall be ready, with heart, will, strength, body, hues and goods, not only to recouer again that which is thus diminished,

but if neede bp, to recouer further (as far as right, and the will and pleasure of God shall l'tiffer) the old dignitje and renowqe of this Realm. The time and place whereof doth not rest in vs, but, as most 6 reason is, in your most noble Majesty, with the aduice of your honourable counsell. Neuertheleffe, since it doth so manifestly appear to vs all what inestimable wafting and consumption of the treasure and ancient reuenues of this Realm hath been of late days, and what great new charges, and intolle rable expenses your highnesse is forced now to fufteine, by reason of the decay and Ioffe of parcell of your ancient Crown: lb, being not ignorant that no worthy enterpife, no noble attempt, no not so much as the preferuation of a strong and puissant estate, may be without some mass of Treasure pre fently to be had, and ready against all occurrents.

III Therefore we your most obedient & louing Subjects, the Lords spirituall & temporall, and the commons in this present Parliament assembled, to Show our willing hearts and good minds, upon mature co fultation had, liaue condescended and agreed with one voice and most entire affections, to make your highnesse at this time a present, not such in deede as in our affections we doe with it,

and as we know most certainly ought to be: but yet of your accustomed clemency which you doc Show to all men, we humbly on our knees pray your Highnesse not to reiebt it, but to accept our good wills and hearty defjres herein, and that this our small gift may be by your Highnesse, the Lords Spiri tuall and Temporal], and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the some enacted.'

"pk fv OST humbly complaining, (heweth vnto your Highnesse, and to your high Court of Parlia 4 L ment> your obedient subjects, the Bowyers, dwelling and inhabiting within the City of Lon

famous memory, King Henrie the eight, begun and held at Westminster, the XVI day of January, in the XXXIII yeere of the raigne of the said late King, and there continued vntill the first day of Aprill then next following, there was one Act and Statute then made and prouided, entitled: an Act for the maintenance of Artillery, and debarring of vnlawfull garnet. In which Act and Statute,

amongst other things there is one branch contained and specified: tenor whereof is, as heere after followeth. That is to say: And to the intent, that euery person may have Bows of meane price, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that euery Bowyer, dwelling out of the City of London, shall after the feast of the Purification of our Lady then next comming, for euery Bowe that he maketh of Ewe, make three other Bows meet to (hoote in, of Elme, Witchhafell, Ashe, and other wood apt for the same, under the paine to loose and forfeit for euery such Bow so lacking III s. 4 d.

And although the said branch of the said Statute, be needfull and expedient to remaine and continue for such Bowyers as doe dwell and inhabite in the Countrie, and other places out of the City of London and the Suburbs of the same: Yet for as4 much as there be very few or no Bows of Elme, Witchhafell, or Ashe, or of any other wood then only of Ewe, used or occupied by any person within the said City and Suburbes of the same, there fore the said branch of the said Act and Statute before rehearsed, was not, nor is needfull to be had and made for the Bowyers dwelling within the said City and Suburbes. And yet neuerthelefle, 'your said Subjects, for the auoiding of the danger and penalty contained in the said branch, are daily in forced to make such great number of Bows of Elme, Witchhafell, and Ashe, that they cannot in cone uenient time vtter and fell the same, but are constrained to keep such Bows by them so made, vntill they be putrified, and not meete for any good vfe or purpose. By reafen whereof, much of the said wood of Elme, Witchhafell, and Ashe, is daily wasted and confirmed in making of the said Bows, and your said subjects, by such Losses as they daily sustaine in making such Bows, greatly impoueriftied,

and the commonwealth therby nothing aduanced, but rather hindered. And where also in the fe uerall Statutes of the noble King of famous memory, King Edward the foorth, made in the XXII

WHERE as the vfe of Archerie, not only hath euer been, but also yet is by Gods speciall gift to the English nation a finguler defence of this Realm, and an occasion of many noble vidories, and both very wholesome exercise for the health and strength of mens bodies, and a mainteinance of a great Number of the Queenes true fubiedes and artificers, as Bowyers,

Fletchers, Stringers, arrowhead makers, and other of this Realm: and for that among other causes of the decay of Archerie, one great cause is the excefliue price of Bow ftaues, which groweth princi

pally by the fcarfitie of Bow ftaues brought into the Realme.' For reformation whereof, be it enacted by the authority of this present Parliament, that all the Statutes made in the twelfth year of the reigne of King Edward the fourth, concerning bringing in of certain number of Bow ftaues, according to the waight or value of other wares to be brought into this realm, shall from henceforth be duly put in execution.

C And ' where the greatest cause of not putting the said Statute in execution hath been, that the torfaitures there by limmitted, are by the said Statute giuen only to the Queenes Majesty, her heires, and succesiours,

without any reward to the person that shall sue for the lamebee it enacted that from henceforth all the forfeitures appointed by the said Statutes, shall be imploied in form following, that is to say, the one half thereof to the Queenes Majesties, her heires, and successors, the other half to such personas shall sue for the same in any Court of Record, wherein no Effoine, protection, nor wager of law for the default shall be admitted or allowed. And it may please the Queenes most excellent Majesty, that it be on her highnesse part straightly charged and commanded, that all the Statutes now remaining in force, for repressing of vnlawfull games, and for the mainteinance and vfe of Archerie, shall be duly put in execution for euer under paines in the said Statutes conteined.

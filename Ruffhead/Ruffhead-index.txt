PREFACE.

The following Index contains an epitome of the Statute Law, from Magna Charta to the present time; and was originally compiled by the late Owen Ruffhead, Esq; as far as the fourth of the present King, for the quarto edition of the Statutes, which the Public hath so highly distinguished with their approbation.

The titles are numerous, and the subject under each is, in general, disposed in chronological order, by which the intelligent Reader will with ease discover, not only the various alterations and improvements that have, from time to time, been made in our laws but their connexion and dependence on each other. And as the Common Law, in a great measure, depends on, and is intimately connected with the Statute Law; (the latter being intended to correct and supply the defects of the former j) the disposition of the different subjects in the manner abovementioned, shows the great improvements which have been made, during a long course of years, in the legislation of this country.

It will sometimes be found, that several branches or minute parts of a subject have undergone alteration, when the subject itself has remained unaltered. Whenever that is the case, the subsequent laws are mentioned and referred to, immediately after the reference to the original Statute, so that the chronological order is generally preserved, unless by a deviation from it, the subject can be rendered more perspicuous.

In some instances, indeed, the multiplicity of the Statutes hath been such, that the chronological order is the most proper; in these cases the utility of a work such as this, is self evident.

Farther, after mentioning all the Statutes that can, with propriety, be referred to, under any particular head, references are added to those other titles that contain Statutes, any part of which bear a relation to ghat head: and for the more easy finding those parts, bearing such relation, every title is divided into branches or parts, according to the nature of the subject, which are numbered in a regular series, and the reference in question is made to the Number, as well as to the Head. For these reasons, among others, it is hoped this Index will be found to be the most useful hitherto published.

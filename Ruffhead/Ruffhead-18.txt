called Scotland, and for the better Securing the Peace and Quiet of that Part of the Kingdom; reciting, that it was found, by Experience, that the Sums for which Bail is to be taken on any Criminal Information, in pursuance of the said Act of the Parliament of Scotland, were too finall and disproportioned to the Danger of the Criminals escaping from the Punishment appointed by Law, it was enacted.

[From Aug. 1, 1799, no British Vessel shall carry Slaves from the Coast of Africa, unless entered for that Purpose at Port of Clearance.]

That, from and after the first Day of August next after the passing of this Act, it shall not be lawful for any Master or other Person taking or having the Charge or Command of any British Ship or Vessel whatever, which shall clear out from any Port of this Kingdom, to take or have on board, or to convey, carry, bring, or transport Slaves from the Coast of Africa to any Part beyond Sea, in any such Ship or Vessel, unless such Ship or Vessel shall, at the Time of her so clearing out, have been entered for such Purpose at the Custom House of the Port from whence such Ship or Vessel cleared out.

[The whole Space between Decks of such Vessels shall be allotted for the Slaves; and after two Thirds of the Complement of Slaves are taken on board, no Stowage shall be put into the Place allotted for them.]

II. And be it further enacted, That in every such Ship or Vessel, the whole Space between Decks shall be allotted and properly prepared for the Reception of such Slaves; and that after any such Ship or Vessel shall have taken two third Parts of her Complement of Slaves on board, in the Proportion herein after to be limited, no Goods, Wares, Merchandize, or Stores, shall ever be stowed or put in any such Place in which any such Slaves shall be.

[The Space between Decks allotted for Slaves shall be five Feet high.]

And whereas Ships or Vessels having only one Deck, are Sometimes used for shipping and carrying Slaves from the Coast of Africa, be it further enacted, That in all such Vessels a false Deck shall be fixed in the Hold for the Reception of the Slaves; which shall be taken and considered as her Lower Deck for the Purposes of this Act.

[No Vessel shall clear out till the proper Officer of the Customs shall have admeasured it as herein described, and certified the same to the Collector.]

V. And be it further enacted, That no Ship or Vessel shall be permitted to clear out from any Port in Great Britain, for the Purpose of shipping and carrying Slaves from Africa, until the proper Officer of the Customs at such Port shall have examined and admeasured such Ship or Vessel, and shall have certified in Writing to the Collector of his Majesty's Customs at such Port, the Height between Decks, and also the extreme Length and Breadth, in Feet and Inches, of the Lower Deck of the said Vessel; which Length and Breadth being multiplied together, the Product shall be deemed and considered to be the true Superficial Contents of the said Deck; and the said Contents so obtained, being divided by Eight, the Quotient in Whole Numbers shall express the greatest Number of Slaves which the said Vessels shall be permitted to have on board at any one Time (for which Certificate he shall be entitled to demand and receive the Sum of ten Shillings from the Master or Owner of the said Vessel);

[Vessels shall have painted on their Stern the Words 'Allowed to carry Slaves,' and the Number they are permitted to carry.]

VI. And be it further enacted, That every such Ship or Vessel, previous to her being cleared out, shall have painted in White or Yellow Letters, of a Length not less than four Inches, upon a Black Ground, on some conspicuous Part of her Stern (provided there shall be Sufficient Space for that Purpose, but if not, in Letters as large as the Space will admit) the Words 'Allowed to carry Slaves,' the Number of Slaves expressed in the Licence annexed to the Clearance of the said Vessel being added thereto, in Figures of the same Length and Colour.

[Masters of Vessels shall forfeit 30l. for every Slave exceeding the Proportion of one Slave for every eight square Feet of the Lower Deck.]

VII. And be it further enacted, That it shall not be lawful for any Master or other Person taking or having the Charge or Command of any such Ship or Vessel, to take or have on board at any one Time, or to convey, carry, bring, or transport Slaves from the Coast of Africa to any Part beyond the Sea, in any such Ship or Vessel, in any greater Number than in the Proportion of one such Slave for every eight Square Feet of the Superficial Contents of the Lower Deck of such Ship or Vessel, ascertained as herein-before directed; and if any such Master or other Person taking or having the Charge or Command of any such Ship or Vessel, shall act contrary hereto, such Master or other Person as aforesaid shall forfeit and pay the Sum of thirty Pounds of lawful Money of Great Britain, for each and every such Slave exceeding in Number the Proportions herein-before limited, one Moiety whereof shall go to his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, and the other Moiety thereof shall go to any Person or Persons who shall first sue for the same.

[12th July 1799.]

WHEREAS considerable Disadvantages to the Trade of the Port of London arise from the circuitous Course of the River Thames round the Tradfc of Land, called The ljle of Dogs: And whereas,

from the very great and progressive Increase of the Number and Size of Ships and other Vessels trading to the Port of London, the River Thames, in the said Port, is, in general, so much crowded with Shipping,

Lighters, and other Craft, that the Navigation of a considerable Part of the said River is rendered tedious and dangerous; and there is much Want of Room in the said Port, for thefafe and convenient Mooring of Vessels and Access to them: And whereas great Inconveniences are also experienced in the said Port, for Want of Regulations concerning the navigating and mooring of Vessels in the same: And whereas Want of Accommodation for the landing and shipping of Goods, Wares, and Merchandize, has for some Years past been experienced, by Reason of the confined and crowded State of the legal Quays in or belonging

to the said Port: And whereas great Delays, Accidents, Damages, Losses, and extraordinary Expences, are sustained from the aforesaid Cause, to the Hindrance of Commerce, and the great Injury of the Publick Revenue: And whereas the said Evils might, in a considerable Degree be remedied, if a navigable Canal for Ships and other Vessels were made across the said ljle of Dogs, between Blachwall and Limehouse Hole,

and if proper Measures were adopted for the better navigating and mooring Ships and other Vessels in the River Thames; and also if good and sufficient Wet Docks and Basons were made in some Part or Parts of the said ljle of Dogs, with Quays, Wharfs, and Warehouses attached thereto, for the Reception, Discharge, and Loading of Ships and Vessels in the West India Trade: But inasmuch as the same cannot be

An Act to enable the Commissioners of the Customs to allow, until the first Day of jipril one thousand eight hundred, British Plantation Sugars to be warehoused; to revive so much of an Act, made in the thirty-second Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, as relates to the ascertaining the average Price of Sugar, and regulating the Allowance of Drawback on the Exportation thereof; and for allowing, until the fifth Day of May one thousand eight hundred, certain Drawbacks on Sugar exported.

[12th October 1799.]

WHEREAS from the increased Importation of Sugar into this Kingdom in the present Year and from other Circumstances which have recently occurred, the Owners and Consignees thereof are utterly unable to find an immediate Market for large Quantities now on Hand, and a further Importation to a considerable Extent is expected; and it is therefore expedient that further Time should be given for the Payment of Duties on such Sugar imported, or to be imported into Great Britain after the passing of this Act, for which the Duties have not already been paid May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the Ring’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That, from and after the passing of this Act,arld until the first Day of April one thousand eight hundred, if shall be lawful for the Commissioners of the Customs for the Time being, in England and Scotland respectively, to take Bond to his Majesty from the Importer or Importers, Proprietor or Proprietors, Consignee or Consignees, of any British Plantation Sugar* for the Payment of the Duties chargeable upon any such Sugar imported into any Port in Great Britain, at any Time after the passing of this Act, or upon any such Sugar in respect whereof such Duties shall not have been paid before the passing of this Act; and all Sugars so bonded as aforesaid shall be lodged and secured at the foie Expence ox the Importer or Importers, Proprietor or Proprietors, Consignee or Consignees thereof, under the joint Locks of his Majesty and such Importer or Importers, Proprietor or Proprietors, Consignee or Consignees thereof, in such Warehouse or Ware-houses as shall be fit for that Purpose, and shall be approved of by the said Commissioners of the Customs in England or Scotland, as the Case may be; and such Sugars shall not be delivered, cleared, or taken from any such Warehouse, unless or until the full Duties due and payable thereon shall be first paid to the proper Officer of the Customs; and if the Importer or Importers, Proprietor or Proprietors, Consignee or Con-signeesof such Sugar shall omit, neglect, or refuse to pay and satisfy all the Duties due and payable in respect of such Sugar within six Months from the Date of any Bond given under this Act for the Payment of the Duties upon such Sugar as aforesaid, it shall be lawful for the Commissioners of the Customs in England and Scotland respectively, at the Expiration of such Period as aforesaid, to cause such Sugar to be publickly sold to the best Bidder, at such Places as the said Commissioners of the Customs in England and Scotland i;e-spectively shall think proper, and out of the Proceeds of such Sale to satisfy such Duties, together with all such Expences as shall havearifen relating to any such Sugar; and the Overplus (if any be) shall he paid to the Importer or Importers, Proprietor or Proprietors, Consignee or Consignees of such Sugar, or such other Person or Persons as shall be authorised to receive the same.

II. And whereas by an Act passed in the ldft Session of Parliament for granting to his Majesty certain 39Gt0 3-c*^3-4 additional Duties on Sugar imported and exported, and on Coffee exported, amf for reducing the Draw- backs allowed on the Exportation of Sugar, certain Provisions of an Act passed in the thirty-iecond Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, for regulating the Allowance of the Drawback and Payment of the Bounty on the Exportation of Sugar, and for other Purposes, as far as the same related to the ascertaining the average Price of Sugar, in Manner in the said Act mentioned, or of regulating the AJowanceuf Drawback,or the Payment of the Bounty on the Exportation of Sugar, was repealed: And whereas it is expedient that the full Drawback and Bounty directed to be withheld by an Act of the thirty sixth Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, and by an Act of the last Session of Parliament, should be allowed in certain cases: And whereas it thereby becomes necessary that the several Provisions of the said Act of the thirty-second Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, as far as the same relate to the ascertaining the average Price of Sugar, and regulating the Allowance of Drawback, of the Payment of Bounty on the c

Exportation of Sugar, should be revived;’ be it therefore enacted, Th*t, from and a'Ler the passing of »‘tiras rrui 59 &4oG£Q. III. SJv thlfe to ascertaining

[30th May 1800.]

WHEREAS by an Act passed in the thirty-fifth Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, intituled, 35 Geo. 3.0.116,* An Act for widening and improving the Entrance into the City of London, near Temple Bar, for making a more commodious Street or Passage at Snow Hill, and for raising on the Credit of the Orphans, 4 Fund, a Sum of Money for those Purposes \ by which Act the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled, were empowered to borrow and raise in the Manner therein expressed, the Sum of one hundred thousand Pounds upon the Credit of the Fund therein described or mentioned, called The Orphans* Fund, to be applied to the Purposes of the said Act: And whereas an 3* G.co, 3*

Act was passed in the thirty-eighth Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, to explain, amend, and c*

enlarge the Powers of the before-mentioned Act: And whereas, considerable Progress hath been mad6 in *-carrying the said Acts into Execution, whereby the Entrance into the said City at Temple Bar hath been greatly improved: And whereas, in forming the original Estimate of the Expences of effecting the said Improvements, sufficient Allowances were not made for the subsequent Depreciation of the Bonds and Securities which by the first recited Act were directed to be given, for securing the Monies thereby authorised to be borrowed; nor were adequate Allowances made for the Sums paid and to be paid in several unforeseen cases, as Compensations for Good-Will, Losses, and Damages, to Persons occupying or being interested in Houses or other Hereditaments, by the said Acts authorised to be purchased; and in the said Estimate Credit was taken for the Monies to be received by Sale of the Ground Rents, and the Reversion, Freehold, and Inheritance of so many Houses, or such Parcels of the Buildings, Lands, Hiene- mems, and Hereditaments by the said Acts authorised to be purchased and taken out of the Streets, as should not be afterwards laid into the Streets, or otherwise appropriated to publick Use; but it being found expedient that the said Improvements to be made at Temble Bar and Snow Hill aforesaid, should be car- ried on at both Places at one and the same Time, the last mentioned Monies, which will amount to a 4 very considerable Sum, cannot be obtained by such Sale until all the Purchases yet remaining to be made pursuant to the said Acts shall be actually made; for which Reasons the Fund created by the first herein- before recited Act, is found,to be inefficient for completing the said Improvements: And whereas, if the Land Tax charged upon the Houses, Buildings* Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments purchased and to be purchased for the said Improvements, were redeemed according to the Statutes lately made and provided concerning the Redemption and Purchase of the Land Tax, such Redemption would be highly be- neficial not only to the Estate so intended to be sold as aforesaid, but ultimately to the Funds provided and to be provided for carrying on the said Improvements: And whereas, the said Fund called The Orphans, 4 Fund was established'by an Act passed in the fifth and sixth Years of the Reign of King IV:Iliam and Queen MaryAy intituled, An Act for Relief of the Orphans and other Creditors of the City of London, for the Pur- W.&M,

poses therein expressed \ which said F und, and the Receipts and Disbursements thereof, are under the Ma- c.io.]

nagement and Direction of the Court of Mayor and Aldermen of the said City of London; and by feve- rai AvSIs passed in the twenty-first Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, and in [2I Geo. 2.

the seventh Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, the several Provisions lor supporting the said Fund c. 29; 7 Geo. 3* 4 have been continued and augmented, and the Whole of the Rates and Charges applicable to the said c, 37.]

Fund, from the Time of passing the iaft mentioned Avft, are to remain and continue until the twenty- ninth Day of September which will be in the Year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one*

when some of the said Rates and Duties are to cease, but the Sum often thousand Pounds per Annum by the said Acts of Parliament, or some of them, charged upon and made payable out of the Revenues of and be-? longing to the said City of London, and certain other of the Rates and Charges therein also mentioned, are thereby continued ufttil the Principal Monies charged upon the said Orphans* Fund, together with Interest for the same shall be paid oft' and annihilated: And whereas the Income of the said F und has for several Years past so much increased as to afford a reasonable Probability, that if the said Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons, in Common Council assembled, were enabled to raise the Sum of thirty-thousand Pounds, to be applied for the Purposes of this Act, upon the Credit of the Surpluses toarife from the said F'und, such Surpluses will be amply sufficient to pay off such further Charge, as well as the Interest on the aforesaid Sum of sixty thousand Pounds, until redeemed in Manner herein after mentioned, together with the Whole of the Debt and Sums of Money already charged thereon, previous to the said twenty-ninth Day of September one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one: And whereas it is expedient that the said Mayor,

Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled, should be empowered to raise and borrow upon the Credit of the said Fund called The Orphans' Fund the further Sum of thirty thousand Pounds, and upon the Credit of the Monies to arise by Sale of the Ground Rents and Estates to V be sold by them, in pursuance and by virtue of the said two recited A<Rs and of this Act, the further Sum of sixty thousand Pounds, to enable them to carry on and complete the said Improvements and redeem the

said Land Tax, and to be by them applied accordingly: But as the same cannot be done without the Aid and Authority of Parliament; therefore, upon the Petition of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled,* may it please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted, &c.

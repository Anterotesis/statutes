THE present Volume embraces the Period from the Accession of King George the First, in the month of August 1714, to the Meeting of the Sixth Parliament of Great Britain (being the Second of the said King’s Reign) in the month of October 1722. The Materials have been principally collected from the following Works: 1. The Journals of the House of Lords:2. The Journals of the House of Commons: 3. The Political State of Great Britain, by Mr. A. Boyer; of which Chandler’s History and Proceedings of the House of Commons, during this period, is a careless Abridgment: 4. The Historical Register: 5. Timberland’s History and Proceedings of the House of Lords: 6. Tindal’s Continuation of Rapin’s History of England: and, 7. Mr. Coxe’s Memoirs of the Life and Administration of Sir Robert Walpole; together with the valuable original Correspondence and authentic Papers contained therein.

The whole of the very important Proceedings, relating to the fatal South Sea Project, have been detailed with, great accuracy: and it is confidently presumed, that the Reader will find in the following pages, the fullest and most complete History of that disastrous Scheme, from the first Proposition of the South Sea Company to Parliament, in January 1720, to the passing of the Bill of . Pains and Penalties against the Directors of the said Company, in July 1721, that has hitheito appeared.

Parliamentary History.

1 GEORGE THE FIRST; , A. D. 1714.

Accession of George th* First.] August 1, 1714. Pursuant to the act of succession, George Lewis, son of Ernest Augustus, first elector of Brunswick Lunenburgh, by the princess Sophia, grnnd-daughter of king James 1. ascended the throne on the death of queen Anne. His {nature age, being then 54 years old [He was born May 28, 1660, ] his experience, his personal qualities, his numerous family, the general peace then in Europe, the interest his allies had to support him, seemed to promise him a quiet and peaceable reign; but, however* he Was not without his disturbances. This prince had great talents for a crown, and bad not failed to exert them on occasion. He was concerned in all the affairs of Germany, and always came off with 'advantage. The great services he had done for the emperor Leopold, determined the emperor Joseph, his successor, to use all his power to procure him admittance into the electoral college: and the emperor Charles, successor of Joseph, caused him to be acknowledged elector by Lewis 14, and by the electors of Coloan and Bavaria, who, till the treaty of Rastadt, had refused him that title. He had waged war in person and with success. His campaign on the Rhine in 1709 was glorious, and would haye been much more so, had not the too great bravery of count Merci disappointed his project of sending aid to the duke of Savoy, to enable him to penetrate into la Franche Comt6.

This prince had an excellent spirit and noble sentiments; be was much more sensible of services than of injuries:courageous, little capable of dissembling or hiding his thoughts; my maxim (said be, soon after his arrival in England) is never to abandon my friends, to, do justice to all the world, and to mar no man/

To these valuable qualities he joined a great application to business, and a sincere desire to lender his subjects happy* All these virtues together had gained him the respect and love of his German subjects, who were all submissive to his null; and their obedience had nothing of constraint, because his commands were always reasonable* and dictated both by equity and geodnesa

Vol. VII. I B

As soon as queen Anne had resigued her last breath, the privy council met, and the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord chancellor^ and resident Kreyenberg (in whose hands they were lodged^ procured the elector of Brunswick three instruments, nominating the persons to be added, as lords justices, to the seven great officers of the realm *. After the opening of the instruments, a proclamation was issued, declaring that the high and mighty prince George elector of Brunswick Lunenberg, was, by the death of queen Anne, become our lawful and rightful liege lord, king of Great Britain, France, and Ireland. — King George was proclaimed at the usual places, and with the usual solemnities, in the qities of London and Westminster. The streets were crowded with multitudes of people, and no disorder was committed. The same day the lords justices appointed the earl of Dorset to carry the king the news of his inauguration, and to attend him in his.journey to England. The earl of Ila, lord justice general of North Britain, having received notice of the queen’s death, and orders to proclaim the king, went to the lodgings of the duke of Montrose (one of the lords of the regency) where he found the marquis of Tweedale, and several other lords and persons of distinction, who, with the magistrates of Edinburgh, and the officers of the state, caused the king to be proclaimed with great ceremony. Two days after the lords justices of Ireland,

* The great officers were; Dr. Tennison, archbishop of Canterbury; lord chancellor Harcourt: John Sheffield, duke of Buckinghamshire, lord president; Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury, lord treasurer; William Legg, earl of Dartmouth, lord privy-seal; Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, first commissioner of the admiralty; sir Thomas Parker, lord chief justice of the KingVhench. To these were added, by the elector of Brunswick, in the instrument under his own hand, the following persons:The dukes of Shrewsbury; Somerset; Bolton; Devonshire; Kent; Argyle; Montrose; Roxburgh; the earls of Pomfret; Anglesey; Carlisle; Nottingham; Abingdon; Scarborough; Orford; lord viscount Townsheud; lord Halifax; and lord Cowper.

S] EARL. HISTORY, 1 Geobce

the arehbishop of Armagh, and sir Constantine Phipps, having received the like notice, proclaimed the king on the 6th of August at Pub-lin. At the same time, they issued a proclamation for disarming papists, and seizing their horses.

There was . not the least disturbance or interruption given in any place to the proclaiming of the king; only at Oxford, the mayor received a letter brought by a person in a batchelor’s gown, requiring him to proclaim the Pretender*.

The mayor communicated this letter to the vice chancellor, and both of them transmitted copies of it to Mr. secretary Bromley, representative for the university of Oxford, who sent them letters of thanks. The vice chancellor also offered a reward of 100/. to the discoverer of. the author. -

In the mean tune, the lords of the regency finding the nation much exposed by the ill condition of the army and fleet, took all possible precautions to guard against a surprise. They dispatched such officers of the army, as they could trust, to their respective posts; gave orders to reinforce the garrison of Portsmouth, and sent vessels out to view the harbours of France. They chose Mr. Joseph Addison to be their secretary, and ordered all dispatches, directed to the secretary of state, to be sent to him. This was particularly mortifying to the lord Bolingbroke, who was now obliged to stand at the door of the council chamber with his bag and papers, and to receive orders from those, whom a few days before, he expected to command. J

SECOND SESSION or, the FOURTH PARLIAMENT of GREAT BRITAIN.

The Parliament meets. 1 The parliament met at Westminster, the afternoon of the very day the queen died, pursqant to the act which regulated* the succession; but sir Thomas Han-mer, hart. Speaker of the House of Commons, ' being in the country, Mr. William Bromley, Secretary of State, moved to adjourn to' the Wednesday* following; which being seconded, sir Richard Onslow opposed the same, as being too long an adjournment at so critical a juncture, and therefore moved for adjourning tojthe next day only; which last motion was agreed to.

The Lords Justices’* Speech to loth .] Aug. 5. The lord Harcourt, lord high chancellor, and the rest of the lords justices, came to the House of Lords, and the House of Commons

* In the letter were'these expressions: “This is to warn you, if you should receive ap order to proclaim Hanover, not tocomply with it, /or the hand of God is now at work to set j things upon a right foot, and in a few days you wjlJ see wonderful changes; which if you are wise; enough to foresee, you will obtain grace and favour from the hand* of his sacred majesty king James, &c." ,

I.1714. — The Parliament meets. [4

being sent for and attending, the lord chancellor made the following speech to both houses,

“My Lords ‘and Gentlemen; — It having pleased Almighty God to take to himself our late most gracious queen, of blessed memory, we hope that nothing has been omitted, which might contribute to the safety of these realms, add the preservation of our religion, laws, add liberties, in this great conjuncture. As these invaluable blessings have been secured to ha by those acts of Parliament, which have settled the succession of these kingdoms in the most illustrious house of Hanover, we have regulated our proceedings by those rules which are therein .prescribed.

. “ The privy council, soon after the demise of the late queen, assembled at St. James’s, where, according to the said acts, the three instruments were produced and opened, which hod been deposited in the hands of the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord chancellor, and the resident of Brunswick. Those who either by their offices, or by virtue of these instruments, bad the honour of being appointed lords justices, did, in conjunction with the council, im* mediately proceed to the proclaiming of our lawful and rightful sovereign king George, taking, at the same time, the necessary care to maintain the public peace.

“ In pursuance of the acts before-mentioned, this Parliament is now assembled; and we are persuaded, you all bring with you so hearty a disposition for his majesty’s service, aod the public good, that we cannot doubt of your assistance in every thing which may promote' those great ends.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons;

‘ We find it necessary to put you in mind, that several branches of the public revenue are expired by the demise of her late majesty; and, to recommend to you, the making such previsions, in that respect, as may be requisite to support the honour and dignity of the crown s And we assure ourselves, you will not be wanting in any thine that may cooduCe to the establishing and advancing of the public credit.

“ My lords and' gentlemen; We fiferbeat laying before you any thing that does not require your immediate consideration, not having received his majesty’s pleasure; we shall only -exhort yon, with the greatest earnestness, to a perfect unanimity, and a firm adherence to our sovereign’s interest, as being the only means to continue among us our present happy tranquillity."

[The Lords’ Address of Congratulation.] The, Lords agreed upon the following Address to his majesty:

“ Most gracious sovereign;

“ We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the lords spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled, though deeply sensible of the great loss tnese nations -have sustained by the demise of her Jate majesty of blessed memory, thjnk ij- our du tp, at the same time,

«) PAUL. HISTORY, 1 Geouc* I.

with thankful hearts to Almighty God, to con- gratulate your majesty upon your happy and peaceable accession to your throne:And we do, wi*h the utmost loyalty and duty, assure your majesty of our zealous and firm resolutions, to support your undoubtedly rightful and lawful title to the crown, against all enemies and pretenders whatsoever. — Our zpal and affection for your majesty's service, engage us to exert ourselves with all vigour and unanimity for securing the public safety; and we will always, to the utmost of our power, maintain the honour and dignity of your crown:And 'we do with faithful hearts beseech your majesty, as soon as possible, to give us your royal presence, which we are persuaded will be attended with all other blessings to your kingdoms."

The King's Answer.] This Address having been sent to the king, then at Hanover, his Alajesty returned the allowing Answer.

* G.R.

u I take this first opportunity to return you my hearty thanks for your address, and the assurances you have given me therein. — The zeal and unanimity you nave shewn upon jpy accession to the crown, are great encouragements to me, and I shall always esteem the continuance of them as one of the greatest blessings of my reign. — No one can be more truly sensible than I am, of the loss sustained by the death of the late queen, whose exemplary pipty and virtues so much endeared her to ner people, and for whose memory I shall always nave a particular regard. — My best endeavour shall pever be wanting to repair this loss to the nation. I will make it my constant care to preserve your religion, laws and liberties inviolable, and to advance the honour and prosperity of my kingdoms. — I am hastening' to you, according to your desire, so affectionately expressed in your Address."

The Address of the Commons.] The Commons being returned to their house,

Mr. Secretary Bromley moved for an Address of condolance and congratulation, insist-inasmuch on the great loss the nation had sustained by the death of the late queen.

Mr. Robert Walpole moved for something more substantial, < to give the king assurances of their making good all parliamentary funds/

Mr. Thomas Onslow, (afterwards lord Onslow) observed. That the stress of the Address ought not to lie upon condoling, but upon congratulating ana giving the king* assurances of their maintaining both his majesty's undoubted title to thecibwn, and public credit/

Accordingly, instructions were given for drawing up the following Address, which was unanimously agreed to the next day; u Most gracious sovereign;

“ We your majesty's most dutifal and loyal •objects, the Commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, having a just sense of the great loss the nation has sustained by the death of our late sovereign lady queen Anne, *f blessed memory, humbly crave leave to coni-.

nil. — Addnstes of Congratulation. [d

dole with your imyesty on this sad occasion. — It would but aggravate our sorrow, particularly to enumerate the virtues of that pious aod most excellent princess; the duty we owe to your majesty, and to our country, oblige us to moderate our grief, and heartily to congratulate your majesty's accession to the throne; - whose princely virtues, give us a certain prospect of future happiness m the security of our religion, laws, and liberties, and engage us to assure your majesty, that we will, to our utmost, support your undoubted right to the imperial crown of this realm, against the Pretender and all other persons whatsoever. — Your faithful Commons cannot but express .their impatient desire for your majesty’s safe arrival and presence in Great Britain. — In the mean time, we humbly lay before your majesty the unanimous resolution'of this House, to maintain the public credit of the nation, and effectually to make good all funds which have been granted by

Parliament, for the security of any money which as been, or shall be advanced for the public service, and to endeavour, by every thing in oar power, to make your majesty's reign happy and glorious."

[The King's Answer.] To this Address tbt king returned the following Answer;

“G.U.

“ Your dutiful and loyal Address is very acceptable to me. The unanimity and affection my Commons have shewn, upon my accession to the crown, are most agreeable instances and pledges of their fidelity to me. I have a just sense of your inexpressible loss, by the death of your late sovereign. You may be assured of my constant endeavours to secure to you the full qpjo^ment of your religion, laws, and liberties; and that it will always be my aim to make, you an happy and flourishing people; to which your resolution to maintain the public credit of the nation will greatly contribute. I am hastening to you according to your earnest desire, and the just expectations of my people."

The Civil List settled.] A motion being made, that a Supply be granted to the king, for the better support of his majesty's houshold, and the honour and dignity of the crown, the consideration thereof was referred to the. committee of the whole House the next day, when the same was agreed to item. con. and framed into a resolution. And on the 7th a bill being ordered to be brought in accordingly, Mr. Wykes proposed tacking to it a bill for limiting the number of officers in the House of Commons, but nobody secouding that motion, it dropped.

Some membershaving moved for sir William Wyndham, Chancellor of the Exchequer, to be chairman of the grand committee of subsidy, Mr. Robert Walpole replied that Mr. Conyers, had for so many years so well discharged that office, that it would be ungrateful, unmannerly and imprudent to chuse another; on which Mr. Conyers carried it. — -Then it was proposed to give the king one million sterling; but this

motion, though not directly opposed, afterwards dropped. *

\

Motion for paying the Hanoverian, and offering a Reward to apprehend the Pretender.] Aug. 12. Mr. Conyers presented to the House the bill for the better support of his majesty's houshold, &c. and on the second reading thereof the next day Mr. Horatio Walpole moved, That the committee of the whole ho use, to whom the said - bill was committed, might have power to receive one clause, to enable the Lord Treasurer, or commissioners of the treasury for the time being, to issue the sum of 65j022/. 8s. 8 d.being the arrear due to the troops of Hanover, for their service in the Low Countries in the year 1712, out of the 300,000l. granted in the last session of parliament to her late majesty, towards satisfying the debt due on account to the land forces. Apd another clause to enable and require the lord high treasurer, &c. to issue out of any money granted by parliament 100,000l. for apprehending the Pretender.

Sir William Wyndham seconded Mr. Walpole in the first clause; and Mr. Shippen, member for Saltash, very ingenuously owned, he bad opposed that payment in the late reign, but that he was for it now. Mr. Aldworth, f

* “ The Whigs acted with extraordinary prudence at this crisis j for when the renewal of the civil list was brought'into the lower House, the Tories, under pretence of extraordinary zeal for the new government proposed one million; which was 300,000l. more than the revenue of the late queen, but the king's friends, apprehensive that the Tories acted insidiously either with a view to conciliate favour, or for the purpose of reproaching him afterwards, as oppressing the nation by a higher revenue than his predecessor had enjoyed, did not second the motion, and it was dropped.” Coxe’s Walpole.

+ “ On the 20th of September the king made his public entry into London. On the following day a sad accident happened, which a little changed the gay humour the pourt was in; Charles Aldworth, esq. .member of parliament for Windsor, bad imbibed at St. Germains in France, strong prejudices against the Hanover succession; which, at his return to England, he made no scruple of publishing, and confirmed them by frequent drinking the Pretender's health. This could not but endear hjm to lord Bolingbroke and his faction; but it drew upon him several quarrels, in which he met with some disgraces; and in the latter part of the queen's reign he set so great a value on that merit of his, that he thought himself not sufficiently taken notice of, which made him a little restive. He gave his tongue a great liberty in railing at the old ministry; and to ingratiate himself with their successors, charged it as a crime on colonel Chudleigh, of the foot-guards, that he had drunk the duke of Marlborough’s health. Colonel Chudleigh, the other colonel's cousin meeting, unexpectedly, Mr. Aldworth in the pre-

member for Windsor, back'd likewise the mo. tion; but as. if he designed to expose the member, .who, at this juncture, appeared so forward to pay those very troops, which, a few months before, he had treated as runaways, hmsaid, “.That for his part, he bad formerly been against that payment, because he baql been given to understand, in that very house, that those troops were deserters; but that bo had since been informed, that they were hired to light, and bad served well as long as there was fighting; and if when they came in sight of the enemy, they who bad hired them, would not suffer them to fight, he did not see the reason why they should he called deserters.” As to the clause, for a reward of 100,000Z. for apprehending the Pretender, Mr. Campion, knight of the shire for Sussex, said, “ That he was not in the House, when that danse was moved; but if he had been present, he would have opposed it, because in his opinion, the Protestant succession was no longer in danger, since his majesty's peaceable accession to the throne; and he defied all the house to prove the com. trary.” He -was seconded by Mr. Shippen t but Mr. W. Puheny, and, after him the lord Lumley argued “ That the Protestant sue* Cession was in-danger, as long as there was a Popish Pretender, who had many friends both at home and abroad: That the iate queen was sensible of that danger, when she issued out her proclamation against him; and that thfe case was not altered by her majesty's demise: That the nation would be at no charge, if the Pretender did not attempt to land: and if hfe did 100,000l. would be well bestowed to ap*» prebend him.'' To which no reply was made.

The Lords* Justices Speech to both Houses on receiving Letters from the King.] Aug. 13. Mr. Craggs, who, the day before the queen died had been dispatched to Hanover, returned this day with letters'from the king to the lords justices: and the chancellor in their name mad# the following speech to both Houses.

“ My lords, and gentlemen; “ It is with great satisfaction we can now tell you, that we have this morning received a letter from the king* wherein his majesty is, graciously pleased to acquaint us, that his majesty is hastening hither to employ his utmost; care for putting these kingdoms into a happy and flourishing con-

Aid worth was killed on the spot, and the king being told it, expressed his indignation at people's quarrelling in his palace; but said, as he came to mainr tain the laws, he would leave the matter' wholly to their decision.?

And we arat^ssured, that, if this had required his more immediate presence, he would without the least delay have repaired hither, for the support of so dutiful and, faithful subjects; for his majesty does very particularly express his great satisfaction in the loyalty and affection which his people have universally shewn, : upon his majesty’s accession to the crown. — At the opening this session, we did not. mention to you the apprehensions we then had, from the smallness of the sum at that time advanced, that the Lottery would not be full; being desirous in the first place to try to make it effectual in the manner the ^parliament bad established it; But we are obliged now to acquaint you, that all our ehdeavodrs have failed of the desired success, though the contributions have been thereby considerably increased. — We must therefore earnestly recommend to you, gentlemen of the House of Commons, to take this into your consideration t and to give such farther encouragement as you shall think proper for raising the whole sum which was intended, and is absolutely necessary, for carrying on the service of the year.

The Speaker's Speech to the Lords Justices on presenting the Subsidy, <§-c.] Aug. 21. The Lords Justices came to the House of Lords, and the Commons attending, the Speaker, on presenting the bill, “ For the better support of “hismajesty’shoushold, &c/*together With another money bill, made the following speech

“ My lords; — The knights, citizens, and burgesses of Great Britain, in Parliament assembled ^, -under the present happiness they enjoy, by his majesty’s peaceable and quiet accession tothe throne, could not enter upon any work more satisfactory and pleasing to themselves, than the providing a sufficient revenae for the occasions of his majesty’s civil government, in order to make his reign as easy and prosperous, as the beginning of it hath been secure and undisturbed.

“ They are sensible, that the peace of the kingdom is not to be preserved, nor the rights and liberties of the subjects to be protected, without supporting the just authority and dignity of the crown; and therefore they have thought it their interest, as well as duty, to make such a provision, as may not barely suffice to the necessity of the government, but may he suitable to the state; the honour, the lustre which the crowu of Great Britain ought to be attended with.

“ Whatsoever is superfluous m that provision, and more than the ordinary services of his majesty shall require, will but enable him to exert his highest and most valuable prerogative ef doing good, : and we can give no greater proof of the trust we repose in his majesty’s, gracious disposition, than patting the same in- tire revenue into his hands, which her lace majesty died possessed of; whose virtues we att

admired, and of whose affections and concern for the religion, laws, and liberties of this kingdom, we bad had so long experience.

“ As the crown itself descends immediately, and knows no vacancy, the Commons have taken care that the revenue should follow it as close as possible; for they have given all the dispatch to this grant, which the forms of their proceedings would allow s so that When his majesty shall please to answer the impatient desires of his people, by coming to take possession of his kingdoms, he will find himself equally established in these, revenues, as if he had succeeded to all by an uninterrupted right of inheritance; the only difference is this, that if he had inherited them, he would have wanted one single proof of the duty, and affection, and unanimity of his subjects.

“ Our desire is that this may be Rooked upon as an earnest and a pledge of that zeal and fidelity which we shall always retain, and which, upon every occasion, we shall be ready to demonstrate to his majesty’s person and government:as such, we hope, his majesty will gra* ciously accept it at this time; and hereafter, when he shall have had experience of the first voluntary offering of his loyal Commons, we hope he will find it to his satisfaction, as large arid as ample as he could wish; might but the term of the grant be as long as we could wish; since it is to have equal continuance with his majesty’s life.

“ My Lords; — The bill which the Commons have passed for the purposes I have mentioned, is entitled, An Act for the better support of ‘ his Majesty’s houshold, &c.’ They have also prepared another bill, entitled, An Act for < rectifying mistakes in the names of the com- missioners for the Land-Tax, and for raising 1 so much as is wanting, to make up the sum of ‘ 1, 400,000l. intended to be raised by a Lottery* for the Public Service in the year 1714.’ This having been recommended to their care, and appearing to them to be necessary for his majesty’s and the public service, they have reason to think, they have abundantly supplied.the defects in the former provision; and in this as-

* “ The parliament had, before the queen’s death passed an act for a lottery for 1, 400,000l. hut public credit was then so low tbatnot above 60 or 70,000l. had been subscribed. This was occasioned partly by the diffidence of the monied men in the late administration, and partly by the tow interest allowed for the blank-tickets. The lords of the regency and privy council, to restore public credit and fill the lottery, went in a body to the h«uk, and subscribed large sums themselves, which was such an encourage meat to others to follow their example* that above 700,000l. was subscribed in two days; and the parliament, pursuant to the king’s desire, giving further encouragement by making a small addition to the interest for the Wank tickets, one per cent, only, the remainder was subscribed in a few days more.” Tiadal.

The Lord Chaneellor*s Speech to both Houses."] The Lords Justices having gave the royal assent to the said Bills, the Lord Chancellor made the following Speech to both Houses:

“ My Lords and Gentlemen We cannot but express our greatest satisfaction, and, in his majesty’s name, return you thanks, for the convincing proofs which you have given in this session of your duty and affection to his majesty, and of your zeal for his government. — We must particularly thank you, gentlemen of the House of Commons, for the aids which you have granted to his majesty, for the better support of the honour of the crown, and for preventing any disappointment in the supplies given in the last session for the service of this year. .You may be assured, that the unanimity, the cheerfulness, and the dispatch with which you have proceeded in granting these aids, will render them yet mOre acceptable to his majesty:and you may depend upon our making a faithful representation thereof to him.

“ My Lords and Gentlemen; AH necessary business being now happily concluded, it will be proper for us to put a speedy end to this Session. We think .fit, at present, in his majesty’s name, to desire you forthwith respectively to adjourn yourselves until Wednesday next."

The Lord Chancellors Speech Session.]Aug. 25. The Lords Justices went to the House of Peers, and the Commons attending, the Lord Chancellor made the following speech:

* My Lords and Gentlemen; — Having, since your late adjournment, received his majesty’s most gracious answer, under his sign manual, to your several addresses; and by his majesty’s /command, ordered them to be delivered to you respectively; we do now in his majesty’s name, prorogue this present parliament till Thursday the 23d.day of September next; and this present parliament is accordingly prorogued to Thursday the 23d day of September next."

letters of friendship' and effectual assistance, were confirmed. At length, on the 16th of September, the king and prince embarked at Orange-Polder on board«the Peregrine and the Mary yacht, which having, soon after, joined the squadron of English and Dutch men of war, that waited for them, under the conitnand of the earl of Berkeley, they all sailed for England, with a fair wind; and, the next day, about nine in the evening, arrived safest the Hope, where the admiral thought fit to drop anchor. There being 8 thick fog the Saturday morning, the yacht did not go up the river till the afternoon. . The king and prince went into a barge in Long Reach, and arrived at Greenwich about six o’clock in the evening. The duke of Northumberland, captain of the life-guard, and the lord chancellor, at the bead of the lords of the regency, received' him at his landing, and complimented him on his safe arrival. The king chose to walk to his house in the park, accompanied by most of the no- bility, and great numbers of the principal gentry, through an infinite crowd of persons of all conditions. Before he left his yacht, he appointed the earls of Dorset and Berkeley to be lords of his bed-chamber, and knighted Mr. William Sanderson, captain of the Peregrine. After the king had undergone the fatigue of passiqg through the crowd, and of giving his hand to all, who approached him, he retired to his bedchamber, and sent for several of the nobility, such as had most distinguished themselves by their zeal for his succession. It was observed that the duke of Ormond, the lord chancellor, and the lord Trevor were not of that number. The earl of Oxford was not at Greenwich that evening, but was one of the earliest there the next morning; * but had the misfortune to be undistinguished among the croud, mid with great difficulty, had at last the bare honour of kissing his majesty’s hand, without exchanging a word with him. Nor did the earl escape such reflections from the spectators, as his conduct had justly deserved. On the other hand, the duke of Marlborough appeared there, justly favoured by the king, and looked upon (though not yet declared) as captain-general. The dukes of Shrewsbury, Somerset, Bolton, Argyle, Montrose, Rutland, and Montague; the marquis of Dorchester; the earls of Dorset, Bridgewater, Sunderland, Carlisle, Berkeley, Nottingham, Portland, Orford, Wharton, and' Cholmondeley; the lord viscount Townshend; the lords Ossulstone, Summers, and Halifax J the bishop of Salisbury; general Stanhope, Mr. lechroere, and many others, received particular marks of favour; and the duke of Ar? gyle was declared groom of the stole to his royal highness; colonel William Carr and colonel Tyrrel, grooms of the bed-chamber; the earl of Hertford, the lord Finch, the lord Lume-ly, and colonel Oughton, gentlemen oft lie bedchamber to the prince.

On the 20th of September, the king and prince of Wales'made their entry with great pomp and magnificence. There were in th *

IS] PAUL. HISTORY, 1 Geo&os I. HU. — during the ReCcit. [14

king’s coach the prince and the duke of Nor* thumberland, captain of the life-guard in wait* ing. Above two hundred coaches of the nobility and gentry, ail with six horses, preceded the king’s. When he came to St. Margaret’s hill in Southwark, he was met by the lord-mayor, aldermen, recorder, sheriffs, and officers of* the city. of London; in whose name sir Peter King, recorder, made a congratulatory speech. The lord-mayor delivered the sword to the king, who returned it to him, and he bore it in the procession bare-headed. The royal pomp continued till his arrival at his palace of St. James’s and was favoured by as fair a day as was ever known in that season of the year.

The court was extremely numerous the next day, when besides the British nobility and gentry, . several foreign ministers made their appearance; particularly those of France, Poland, Prussia, and Sicily, took that occasion to congratulate his majesty’s happy accession to the throne, and safe arrival in England. '

Before we proceed to the events of this reign it will be proper to give a general idea of the state of affairs in Great Britain and Ireland. The animosity between the several parties, which even at this day divide England, was, at king George’s accession, higher than ever. The Whigs, who had been in disgrace the four last years of the queen’s reign, were full of resentment at the usage they had received from the Tpries, and hoped to have full satisfaction under the new reign, which they looked upon as the end of their humiliation. The Tories, on their part, were extremely apprehensive of adownfa)l, and this apprehension had engaged several of their leaders in practices not' only dangerous, but directly contrary to the measures, the nation had taken with the two last sovereigns and the bouse of Hanover. To the views of these men were ascribed the late peace with France, and the violence offered by the queen to her allies, to compel them to a reconciliation with that crown, and to the sacrifice of the fruits of their victories.

Moreover, the principles of the revolution had been far from being universally embraced. Not only the papists espoused the abdicated family, but also great numbers of churchmen; and it was much to be feared, that they would join with the catholics, to dethrone a prince, whom they looked upon as a foreigner. The famous distinction of a king da jure, and a king de facto, was not yet forgot, nor the doctrine of passive obedience; and several refused to take the oaths of allegiance and abjuration.

Scotland was generally dis-satisfied with the union. They were apt to consider themselves as degraded to a province of England. They had always been pleased with the title of an independent kingdom, heartily lamented the lops of it, and as heartily wished to recover it. That the Scots should, at king George’s accession, be in these sentiments, is no great wonder, since it requires ages to root out of the •wmU <tf a catjpn such eon of impressions,

however ill grounded. Accordingly, the Scott began to shew their disconteut soon after the queen’s death, of which there is the following account: the regency having issued a proclamation for a reward Of 100,000£ for seizing the Pretender, they were informed that the Pretender’s friends in Scotland designed an insurrection; and that some of them had been seen to go in arms towards the Highlands; upon which they ordered a good number of half-pay officers, especially of those belonging to the Scots regiments, to go thither immediately, that, in case of necesssity, they might raise the militia of the country under the orders of major-general Whetham, who commanded in chief there. Though this precaution was necessary, yet the Scots Jacobites were so- confounded, that they could do nothing considerable; so that the chief of them only held some consultations, and retired to their lurking places. Some of the Highlanders appeared in a body near fort William at Inverlochy, in the western Highlands. But, the governor sending out a detachment against them; they marched off; so that they could do nothing at that time, in Scotland, but only steal some cattle, and took an opportunity by night to proclaim the Pretender. The government ordered them to be prosecuted; and by way of prevention, the duke of Gordon was confined by the regency to the city of Edinburgh, on his parole; his son, the marquis of Huntley, to his bouse in the north, ; and his son-in-law, the lord Drummond, to his castle of that name. The duke of Athol, lord privy-seal, who bad caused the king to be proclaimed at Perth, was ordered to continue at his castle of Blair in the High- lands, to preserve the peace of the neighbour* hood: and the regency being informed, that the Highlanders bad appointed huntings when it is usual for the clans to attend their chiefs, they forbad those huntings, and ordered sir Donald Macdonald of Slait, one of those chiefs suspected tp be in the Pretender’s interest, to be made prisoner, and sent to the castle of Edinburgh. The lord Drummond was also ordered to be seized, but escaped to the Highlands, front whence he wrote to the lords justices, and oftered bail for his good behaviour. The earl of Broadalbin, who had sufficiently declared himself for the Pretender, though he had abjured him when be sat as one of the sixteen Scots peers, thought fit to retire to an inaccessible castle in a lake, upon ^which a detachment of foot was ordered to guard the avenues; and captain Campbel of Glendoroul, who had a commission by the earl of Oxford’s means, to raise an independent company in the Highlands, was taken at Inverlochy, and . from thence sent prisoner to Edinburgh. The late lord-treasurer had, a little before, set , up a new chamberlain’s court in' Scotland, the old one having been long discontinued, because arbitrary princes had made it a grievance to the subject. The design of reviving it now was only for a cover to bestow money upon such, as were i« the court-measure*. Accordingly,

die earl of Mar, who managed the affaire of Scotland, recommended his own brother in law, «ir Hugh Paterson of Banockburn, and the lord Haddoj eldest son of the earl of Aberdeen, to be two of the commissioners, to whom the queen had granted a bill of 1, 006/. each, payable by Mr. Douglas, receiver-general of the land-tax. The lord viscount Kilsyth, one of the sixteen Scots peers, and the lord Lyon, king at arms, two other relations to the earl of Mar, had also grants for the like sum. Soon after the queen's death sir Hugh Paterson demanded payment of his bill; but the earl of - Ilay, lord-justice-general of Scotland, interposed, and acquainted the regents how unreasonable a thing this was; and particularly that men suspected of disaffection to his majesty's government, should have the public money distributed ampng them. Upon this the lords regents ordered the duke of Athol, lord privy-seal, to put an immediate stop to all grants, that were not passed before the queen’s death; which disappointed those gentlemen of their money, and saved 4000/. to the government.

When the king was proclaimed at Glasgow, forty or fifty unknown persons, while the magistrates were busy in attending the proclamation, ^ook an opportunity to pull down the episcopal meeting-house there, where one Mr. Cockburn had set up the English liturgy, by countenance of the late government, more to disgust the citizens, than in hopes of gaining proselytes. As soon as the magistrates heard of it, they sent to apprehend the actors, and to

£ revent the polling down the bouse; but they ad done their work, and made their escape, before the magistrates came thither; so that none of them were discovered or taken; The jacobite party took occasion from hence to reflect upon the presbyterians, ns if they had persecuted those of the church of England, and insert an account of it in the Post-Boy, with all the aggravating circumstances, that their malice and intention could suggest. Complaint was likewise made of it to the regency, who ordered the lord advocate of Scotland to inquire into it. There was found good reason to suspect, that the thing was done on purpose by the disaffected party, to raise a clamour; because Mr. Cockburn the day be-fbre had retired with hh family and effects to Edinburgh, though the magistrates of Glasgow had given him assurance of protection. This account being taken upon oath by the magistrates, aod sent up to the regency, put an end to that matter. Thus stood the affaire in Scotland, at the time of .king George's accession.

As for Ireland, the chief thing to be dreaded *there was the great number of papists, who me ever ready to throw off the yoke of the English. A little more conduct in king James t, and a little more assistance from Prance, wOuld have endangered that kingdom. And, at the time of the queen's death popeiy was in much the same situation.

. Indeed there seemed to be no danger from

aay foreign power. Holland would not fail to' fulfil all engagements: the king himself was powerful; he had on foot a good number of troops, which, without obstacle, could have been embarked in his own dominions. But, after all Lewis 14 was still alive:It could not be doubted, but that it was against his wiU that he had acknowledged the protestant succession^ and promised inot to disturb it.. He was as* suredly in the same sentiments still, and perhaps thought himself more obliged to keep his word with king James, on his death bed, never to forsake his son, than the engagements, tho necessity of a peace had forced him into. It may be, what be would not do directly, ho might do indirectly; with money, may not troops, arms and ships soon be bad ? It will bo seen in the course of this history, that, without any aid, the English and Scots raised such an insurrection, as caused great disturbances; and what would they have done, had they beeu assisted; in vain would the king have depended on his own troops; they could not be brought over without the consent of the parliament, and the English are too jealous of their liberty, to suffer any foreign forces, and it is with some sort of regret, that they bear even those of the States.

Suoh was the situation of the British dominions and of Europe, when king George came to the throne; and therefore it is no wonder, that, upon his arrival in England, bid first proceedings expressed a dislike of the Tories and the late ministry, and shewed his at* tachment to the Whigs. The persons he had named for the regency, were a plain proof what the friends of the late ministry were to expect. He had, even before his arrival, removed the* lord Bolingbroke and appointed the lord Townshend secretary of state in his room. The day after his lauding at Greenwich, be sent the new secretary to acquaint the duke of Ormond, that; he had no longer occasion for his service as captain-general, but would be glad to see him atcourt.

These changes were followed by many others: the duke of Marlborough was made captain-general of the land-forces, colonel of the first regiment of foot-guards, and master of the ordnance. The lord Cowper was made lord-chancellor, the earl of Wharton privy-seal, and the earl of Sunderland lord-lieutenant of Ireland. The duke of Devonshire was appointed steward of the honshold in the room of earl Panlet, and Mr. James Stanhope secretory of state in the room of Mr. Bromley, and the duke of Montrose in the room of the earl of Mar. The duke of Somerset was made master of the horse, the duke of St. Albans captain of the band of pensioners, and the duke of Argyle commander in chief of the forces in Scotland. Mr. William Pultney was made secretary of war, and Mr. Robert Walpole receiver and pay-master-eeneral of all the guards and garrrisons, and all other forces of Great-Britain, and paymaster to Chelsea hospital, in tbs room of "Mr. How and Mr. Moore.

If J P&Rft ftlSt’OKY^ l Oi'oiiw!. tf metut, jfljf

The pfivy council was dissolved, and a new otvrdactared, of which the earl of Nottingham was president: Out of the privy counsellors a' cabinet council was fbrfneti, consisting' chiefly of the lord-chancellor, the duke of Marlborough, the earls of Nottingham, Sanderlarid, the lords HalllFax, Townsend, Sommers, and general Stanhope.^ All these had distinguished themselves by their professed opposition to the late measures, and the peace.

The governors of places were also most of .thetachanged. General Erie was made governor of Portsmouth. ThVre were as many alterations in Ireland as in England. Before the king's arrival, the behaviour of sir Constantine Phipps bad 'been such, that the regency had removed him, as well as the archbishop of Armagh, from being lords-justices of that kingdom, and in their room appointed the archbishop of Dublin and the earl of Kildare, for which they 'had:the king’s letter of approbation and thanks. Alan Broderick was made lord chancellor of Ireland, and William Whit-ahed thief j ustice. The privy-council was also dissolved, add another named, of which the stake of Ormoh^was one.

All these changes were made before the’ coronation, which was fixed to (he 20th of October. The king is by some blamed, for not having joined to the great number Of Whigs a fr* more of the Tories, which they suppose "Would havd prevented the general discontent of that pafty. But it was very difficult for the king not to do as he did. The inclination which the Pretender had indiscreetly asserted, the qUeen had for him in the latter years of her life, could be ascribed only to those who had the management of affairs. The ministry, resolutely bent to: end 'the war, notwithstanding the complaints of alt the allies (who placed their safety in the humbling of France) and particularfy, notwithstanding the repeated opposition of the duke of Hanover, they could wot but be sensible, that, if he one day-became their master he would not fail to sacrifice them to his own, and the resentment of the' allies, whose projects they had disappointed, and whose hopes they had confounded. It was therefore natural to think, they bad taken measures to prevent any danger from him. A thousand circumstances supported these conjectures:The dowry paid to king James’s queen: the small reward offered for taking the Pretender; the conniving at thp fisting of men in hik ’service: the suffering the revolution to be ptlblidy 'talked and preached against, and doctrines to be vented, destructive of the principles on which it was builtthe little care to have an eyp to Scotland, to redress the grievances complained of by that nation, and which were capable of driving them to extremities:England unprovided of troops as well as Scotland and Ireland, whilst: under frivolous pretences several regiments Were kept in Flanders; mil this amounted to a sort of demonstration, that the queen’s dehtli alone had prevented the defeating of the Protestant succession, and the

VQI.VII,

destroying all that bad bCen done for above twenty years to secure and justify the exclusion of kina James and his pretended heir. Now can there be to a prince attacked in so im-‘ portam a point, any room for pardon or dissimu- ' lation-?

Besides there was a kind of necessity to espouse one of the two partjes, .who had by turns prevailed under kingWitfiam and qaeenArfne,

By that means he would be freed from ther continual trouble of managing and keeping the1 balance even between them, and perhaps from’ the danger of having both turn against him.

The Whigs were really enemies of France and the Pretender, and could not b’e otherwise they had constantly declared for the Protestant ’succession, and though in some of their, proceedings the spirit of party nO less appeared than a true zeal, yet they might be depended upon. To the Whjgk the court of Hanover was, indebted, for obliging the French king and the duke of Lorrain hot to suffer the Pretender in their dominions, and for the advices of what was contriving against the interests of the Pro- ' jtestant successor. This being the case, there was no room to deliberate which party to chuse.

King William, accustomed from his youth to dissimulation, might have deliberated, or seem-, ed to have done so; but the elector of Hanover, absolute master in his German dominions* and consequently unused to faction and party.

Was hardly capable of that dissimulation, so. V requisite in a government like that of England. ’

Notwithstanding all the changes and the disgrace of so many persons, no ill 'effects. fair, lowed. Addresses from the universities, the counties, cities, boroughs and corporations, expressed the public joy and satisfaction at the king’s accession, though in a very different stile; for some insinuated that the protestant succes-. sion had not been in danger, whilst others. spoke of the late ministry in very severe terms, and mentioned the utmost dread of their measures.

The first time the king was. present at .the

E-council, after he had taken the oath re-j to the security of the church of Scotland, he made the following declaration i

* Having in my Answers to addresses of both, houses of parliament, fully expressed my resolution to defend the religious pud civi|. rights, of, r all my subjects, there remains very littleTor me ‘ to say upon this occasion. — Yet having been willing to omit no opportunity' of givingu possible assurances to a people, who have ail . ready deserved so well'of me; I take this oc pasion also to express to you my firm purpose,) to do all that is in my power for the supporting. and maintaining the'churches of England and Scotland, as they are severally by law esta-, blished; which I am of opinion may be e£ Actually done, without the least, impairing tht, toleration allowed by law to protestant dissenters, so agreeable to Christian charity, and so’pecessary to the trade and riches of this king-. dbm.

I assure yop, that there is not any among you shall more earnestly endeavour the preservation of it thafi myself.”

At the same time the prince royal was declared prince of Wales, and took his seat at the upper end of the board, at the king’s right hand. Soon after the treasury was put in commission, and also the admiralty. The commissioners of the treasury were the lord Hal-lifax, sir Richard Onslow chancellor of the exchequer, sir Wdliam St. Quintin, Edward Wortley Montague, and Paul Methuen. Those of the admiralty were the earl of Orford, sir George Byng, George Dodington, sir Johp Jennings sir Charles Turner, Abraham Stan-yan, and George Bailie. John Aislabie was made treasurer of the havy, and the earl of Cholmondeley was appointed treasurer, Hugh Boscawen comptroller, and Edmund Dunch master of the king's houshold. Dr. Samuel Garth was knighted, who had lately published a Latin dedication, which he intended to prefix to an edition of Lucretius three years before:but it was not then thought seasonable.

On the 9th of October, N. S. the two eldest princesses of Great Britain, Anne and Amelia, set out from Hanover, to go by easy journies, to the Hague; the youngest princess Caroline being left at Hanover, on account of a late indisposition. Three days after, the princess of Wales set out for Holland, attended by the countess of Pickleburgh; and, on the 17th, arrived at the Hague, with the two eldest princesses her daughters. The next morning she received the compliments of the states general, by deputies nominated for that purpose; and, the weather being fair, she appeared in the afternoon in the Voorhout, attended by a very numerous train of coaches; and, in the even-. ing, kept a drawing room, at which all the ladies and persons of distinction of that place were present. The next day she received visits from the French ambassador, and other foreign ministers. The earl of Berkeley and Sir John Walter of the green cloth were come thither five days before, having left the squadron of men of war at Helvoet-sluys, with orders for the yachts to come up to Rotterdam. The princess being informed by the earl, that the wind was easterly, on the 20th of October, N S. she went on board a yacht of the states of Holland, accompanied by the earl of Alber-marfe, and the rest of the deputies of that province; by the count of Hanau, and the countess, her sister, prince William of Hesse, and the prince of Anhault. The earl of Straftbrd accompanied her'also part of her way to Rotterdam, where being arrived, she embarked on board the, Mary yacht, and with the two princesses and their retinue, landed at Margate, Oci< her 11, O. S. and the next eveuing arrived at Rochester. The prince of Wales, having early that day received the news of her arrival, set out about seven o'clock in the morning, accompanied by the dukes of Somerset and Argyle, and the carl of Bridgewater, lordrchamberlaia

to their royal highnesses. The prince met the, princess beyond Rochester, where site was attended by the countesses of Dorset and Berkeley, who had been named two of the ladies of the bed-chamber. Their royal highnesses pass- . ed through the city of London in a chariot with, six horses, followed by another, in which were; the two young princesses, and came to St. James's on the 13th of October.

The day appointed for the coronation drawifig, near, the king, as usual on such occasions, advanced some of the peers to higher titles, and created some new ones. Five days after, the coronation was performed at Westminster with . great magnificence. There never was so great an appearance of lords spiritual and temporal as on this occasion, no less than 17 archbishops and bishops, though two sees were then vacant; all the dukes in or about London, except the duke of Buckingham; seventy earls and viscounts, and amongst them the earl of Oxford . and viscount Bolingbroke; and as many ba-; rons. The demonsUMions of joy throughout the kingdom on the coronation-day seemed to; be general, and were in proportion as splendid-, as at London, some few places excepted, where, * the rabble shewed their hatred to the protestant succession, by riots and outrages. The univer-. sity of Oxford (who, the day before, had presented to the king by Dr. Gardiner, their vice-chancellor, a book of verses on the death af queen Anne, and the accession of his majesty to., the throne) on the coronation-day, conferred unanimously, in a full convocation, the degree < of doctor of civil law on sir Constantine. Phipps, with all imaginable marks of honour and esteem.

The first affair the king turned his thoughts to was the execution of an article of the treaty of Utrecht, the demolition of Dunkirk; from whence the trade of England and Holland had. been greatly incommoded during the late wars. Instead of executing this article, the French king had entirely evaded it; and therefore Mr* Prior, who was.still resident at Paris, was ordered to present a Memorial to him, pressing the performance of the 9th article of the treaty of Utrecht. The French king, who had used the distinction of the letter and spirit of trea--ties to justify his noocompliaoce with<he treaty of partition, adhered to the letter of this, and pretended he bad fulfilled it in the utmost extent. His answer was not satisfactory; Prior . was recalled, and the earl of Stair sent in his room, who prosecuted the affair with great vigour. The court of France would not yield, and declared in express terms, Mardyke was not Dunkirk, and that the treaty of Utrecht did not deprive the king of the natural right of a sovereign, to make what works he should judge proper for the preservation of his subjects. The truth is, the plenipotentiaries of Great Britain had been too negligent in the affair.

In stipulating the demolition of Dunkirk, it was doubtless their intention that another and better harbour should not be made on that coast: but then it should have been so expressed; otker-

wise in such articles all advantages will be taken by those on whom they are imposed.

The same fault had been committed in the treaty of commerce with Spain. The advantages obtained in t£e body of the treaty were all explained away by the separate articles, And the result was, that the British goods and merchandizes paid seven per cent, more than had been paid before. King George applied himself also to redress this grievance. Spain, in imitation of France, adhered to the letter of the treaty, and would not agree that the terms should be explained according to the intentions of the queen’s plenipotentiaries; and it was hot till after much time and pains that this, and several other difficulties relating to the Assiento contract, were adjusted. So true is it, that a good negotiator is as rare and as useful as a great general.

The Barrier Treaty, which rtras negociating at Antwerp between the emperor and the States General, and which was of great consequence to the trade of England, drew also the attention of the new king. General Cadogan, io-timate friend of the duke of Marlborough, was sent ns plenipotentiary.

In the mean time, the behaviour of the jacobite and high church party occasioned the publishing a proclamation for suppressing of riots and tumults. Seditious libels were with great industry dispersed, jealousies infused into weak minds, and the groundless clamour of the danger of the church revived. In November the dukes of Marlborough, Shrewsbury, and Argyle, the earls of Nottingham and Sunderland, the lord Townshend, the marquis de Monteleone the Spanish ambassador, the count de Nostiz, and several other persons of distinction, received, by the mail from France, copies of a paper, printed in English, French and Latin, signed at the top James R. and dated at Plombieres the 29fh of August, 1714, N. S. being a kind of manifesto or declaration of the Pretender, aserting his claim to the crown of Great Britain. He says, ‘ The revolution ‘ ruined the English monarchy, laid the foun-

* dation of a republican government, and de-*vblved the sovereign power on the people.* He observes, That when he found the treaty

* of peace was upon the point of being con-

* eluded without any regard to him, he publish-

* ed, in April 1712, his protestation against it.* He then gives the reason of his sitting still for some time past, in these remarkable words:‘Yet, contrary to our expectations, upon'the ‘death of the princess our sister (of whose good ‘Intentions towards us, we .could not for some ‘ time past well doubt; and this was the reason

* we then sat still, expecting the good effects

* thereof; which were unfortunately prevented ‘‘by her deplorable death) we found that our ‘‘people, instead of taking this favourable op-

* portunity of retrieving the honour and true

* interest of their country, by doing us and

* themselves justice, had immediately proclaim-‘ ed for their king a foreign prince, to our prejudice, contrary to the fundamental and in-

711. — Proceedings during the Recess.. [22

* contestable laws of hereditary right, which ‘their pretended acts of settlement can nerer ‘ abrogate.* The persons who received this declaration, thought it their duty to deliver it into the hands of the secretaries of state; upon which the marquis de Lamberti, the duke of Lorrain’s minister, was forbid the court, because such a thing could not be done at Plombieres without the countenance of his master; and the following message was delivered to him by the(lord Townshend:“ That it was inconsistent with his majesty’s honour and dignity, as well as interest, to admit to audience the minister of a prince, who at that very juncture, gave shelter and protection to a Pretender, and an open enemy to his dominions..” The marquis transmitted this message to the duke of Lorrain, left London, and, and went to Oxford to wait his master’s answer. This gave just cause of suspicion, that the Pretender and hjs friends had formed a party in that university to advance his interest, as it afterwards appeared. The marquis, having received the duke of Lor-, rain’s answer, dated at Nancy, December the 9th, 1714, N. S. communicated it to the lord, Townshend. It was to this effect;

“ I believe, Sir, you no ways doubt of my being extremely surprised to hear by the courier, which came from you, that, when you applied to my lord Townshend to obtain an audience, that minister made answer, that since; the chevalier de St. George remained still in' my dominions, the king thought fit to forbid, you the court: in case his majesty should continue in this disagreeable resolution with respect to me, 1 must submit to his pleasure, and you have nothing else to do, but to return hither as soon as you are able. However, you are first to apply to the duke of Marlborough, and to the king’s ministers, desiring them to lay before his majesty the unfortunate situation I am in, if, after having been so ready to let the king know the part I take in his accession to the crown of England, and after having been one of the first to make my compliments, and show my zeal on this occasion, all Europe should be acquainted, that his majesty had some reason to he dis-satisfied with me. That I cannot conceive, whence this should proceed, since as to the chevalier de St. George, the woild knows, by what means he came into this country:that every one is informed of the situation of my territories, which are surrounded and cut through on all sides by France: that it is known how I had no share in his coming into:my country: that I neither invited him to come thither, nor could I force him to go away:that lately upon the death of queen Anne, I knew nothing of his leaving Bar, till twelve hours after be was gone from thence; and I knew, nothing o'f his return to Bar, till after he was< come back, as a traveller, that goes backwards’ and forwards in an open country, and intermixed with other territories as mine is:as to the manifesto or declaration dated at Plombieres, which the chevalier de St. George had got printed, I knew nothing more of it, than that

he gave me ope after it had been published; but that'teally Tam much concerned to hear from you/tbat it‘has been reported) that the tame manifestoes hayq been spread abroad by bi* Vhdse of your retinue. 1 own fo you, that I am extremely concerned at this, and that in some sort it seems to be a design to make me tjneasv, to give out, that either I or my servants meddled in such an affair.

‘ These are the reasons, which I have to offer, and which I would have you desire those gentlemen to lay before the king, in hopes they iviirconvince his majesty of my most respectful adherence to him, and that his majesty will be pleased to admit you to an audience.

“ But, if contrary to my expectation, the king will not grant you an audience, you are to come away, having desired the ministers to let tfre king knoiv the concern I am under; and that I hope his majesty will please to accept of fty good intentions, and the early care I took fo shew him the inyiolable zeal I have for him.”

• When the marquis communicated this letter to , the king’s ministers, he, at the same time, depressed ’his master’s “ deep concern at this Unlucky affair, which obstructed the friendship and good understanding he had so early sought With his Britannic majesty, for whom he ever entertained the highest esteem and veneration.” And he likewise expressed his own particular concern, and the great mortification it was to bitn, not to be admitted to a court which he had so great a "desire to b'e made known to. He Was answered, “ That it wasnQtout of any prejudice to his person, nor even to the person df his master, for whom the king had p great esteem'. But, that, as affairs stood at present, though his excuses were, in some measure, allowable, yet his majesty was the best judge of What was consistent with his own honour and dignity; and, as his majesty was likewise sensible' of the duke’s readiness to seek and cultivate a friendship with his majesty, so the king wished, that the causes, which obstructed the same at present, might be speedily removed, ” The marquis finding by this answer, that his majesty insisted bn the removal of the Pretender from the dominions of Lorrain, before he would admit him to an audience, took his leave of the lor^ Townshend, antj, on the iSth of December, get out on his return home. In answer to that part of. the duke of Lorrajn’s letter, wherein he alledges, “Thathis territories Wre Surrounded and cut through on all sides by France; that he neither invited the chevalier de St. G^ofge thither, nor'could force him to go away ; ” a paper transmitted hither by Mr. Prior, and* delivered ' to him by the marquis deTorcy, was said to be produced to the marquis, thereby his indst Christian majesty declared.

That he rteitlWr did, nor would in any manner Concern himself with the chevalier de St. George winch declaration was directly contrary to the dvike of Lorrain's allegation.

" When the Pretender’s declaration came first into England, and -was published in the fo-reijpiprims/the Jaoobites and Tones insisted

upon its being a contrivance of the Whigs, to reflect qii the memory of the queen, end to fix an odium upon the high church-party, because in that declaration he said “ That fqr sometime past he coulli not well doubt of hit sister’s good intentions towards him.” But they were much confounded by the duke ofEorrain? letter, which owned the declaration to be genuine, and that the Pretender himself bad give it him one of them.

About the latter end of November, thp king advanced the ‘ salaries of the chief-justice of the king’s-bench, and of the chief barons of the exchequpr, to the same $um, as was allowed the chief justice of the common pleas, being 3,000/, a year, and the salaries of the other nine judges to 1, 500/. a year.

About this time Addresses were set on foot in Scotland, for dissolving the union; and it was' also proposed, that none should be elected members of parliament there, but such at would promise to use their endeavours for that purpose. Many well-meaning people seemed at first inclinable to fall in with those measures; 'but when they found, that the Jacobites were the most zealous in pushing this affair, in order to raise confusion and discord betwixt the two nations, they refuted to concur, and referred, their grievances by the pnion to be .considered, when the nation should be Better settled. ‘ Bug there was a quite different spirit among "the high-church party in England, who excited riots and tumults in many part of the kingdoms to which they had been encouraged by the Pretender’s declaration. To prevent.these disorders, a proclamation wps published on the 6th of December.

Qn the 5th of January, 1715, a Proclamation was published for dissolving the parliament, and, on the l$th, another was issued for calling a new one, in (he following terms:“ It having ‘pleased Almighty God, by most remarkable steps of his providence, to bring us safe, to the crown of this kingdom, notwithstanding the designs of evil men, who shewed themselves disaffected to pur succession, and who have since, with l bp utmost degree of malice, misrepresented our firm resolutions and uniform endeavours to preserve and defend our most excellent constitution both in church and state, and attempted, by many false suggestions, to render us suspected to pur people; we cannot omit, po this occasion of first summoning our parliament of Great Britajn, in justice to ourselves, and that the miscarriages of others may not be imputqd to us, at a time, when false impressions may do the greatest and irrecoverable hurt, before they can be cleared up, to signify to bur whole kingdom, that we were very much concerned, at our accession to the crown, to find the publ c affairs of our .kingdom upder the greatest difficulties, as well in respect of our trade, and interruption of our navigation, as of the great debt* of our nation, which, wf were surprised to observe, had been very muck increased since the conclusion of the lust'wft* We do uo^ therefore doubt, that! if the ensuing

The late ministry, foreseeing they should -be called to an account for their conduct, had frequent consultations how to avoid the storm; and soon after a traiterous libel was published, under the title of, “ English Advice to the Free- holders of Great Britain." Nothing -could be more full of malice and falsehood against the ting’s person ayd family; as well as against the Whigs in general, and the present ministry; and it was artfully contrived to raise discontents among the people against the government, and to possess them with an opinion, that the church was in danger by his majesty's administration. j, t was carefully dispersed through the’country, and great numbers of them were intercepted in thp city of Exefor. Upon which the govermpent issued opt a proclamation, promising a reward of lvQ0jl>/. for the discovery of the author of the libel, and 500/ for the discovery of the printer. But to no purpose.

The same day, the mismanagement of the late ministry, with regard to Chelsea-college, was made public by order of the priyy-epun- cil; upon which, the government of that hospital, was changed, and brigadier Stan wick Appointed governor.

The earl of Strafford being returned to England, an order of council was issued, that the lord Townsend and hjjr, Stanhope, secretaries of state, should go to him, and demand the original instructions and orders, and all letters he had received from the late ministry, or any foreign prince or minister, and copies of all instructions, of which he had not the originals; and also all letters writ by him to any person whatsoever, * relating to his negotiations, from the time of his first being at the Hague. The earl delivered them two trunks, which he said, contained what they desired; and orders were sent to seal up his papers, that were on ship-board, or at the custom-house.

Mr. Prior, whq had heen deep ip the measures of the late ministry, wqs now ordered home, the earl of Stair beings arrived at Paris, Where he bad several conferences with the marquis de Torcy, and presented memorials about the canal and intended port, at Mardyke, and signified to the court of France, that he had orders not to take any character upon him, fill be had a dear and positive answer to the memorials.

The elections for the new parliament were now carrying.on with great warmth by both parties, but with most success on the side of the Whigs. The ejectors in some counties and cities drew up instructions for their repre-

sentatives, the inept remarkable of which were those of the city of London, wherein was this passage; “ We desire and expect, that you will inquire by whose jdounsel it was, that, after God had blessed the arms of her late majesty, and her allies, with a train of unparalleled successes, she was prevailed upon, contrary I# the grand alliance, and her repeated promises from the throne to both houses, to send to, or receive managers from France, to treat separ rately of a peace, without the knowledge and consent of our allies, "

In Scotland the Tories published a circular letter, to dissuade the Scotch lords from voting for the Whigs, or, as they pretended, for the. sixteen peers, of whom' the duke of Aegylehrel brought a list from England, But thuT letfir' made little impression, and the following peedi were elected, the dukes of Roxburgh and Montrose; the marquisses of Tweedale, Lothian, and Annandale; the earls of Sutherland, Rothes, Buchan, London, Orkney, Stair, Bate, Deloraine and Jlay; and the lords Bose and Bqlhaven. All these lords were distinguished by their attachment to the revolution, and had contributed to the union to the utmost of their powtqr. Tbp marquis of Anonndale, the antiant family of Johqstotra, had openly declared for king William, though, shortly after indeed> he declared for king Jamies. But be repented of that step, and for his faithful services was employed in places of trust. The marquis of Lothian was a great promoter of the revolution. He had, in the reign of king James 3, married a daughter of the earl of Argyle, beheaded by that prince, purely out of a principle of honour, and, to shew his regard for a family unjustly persecuted, a certain proof that he would net favour the designs of the Pretender. The earl of Sutherland, known at the time of the revolution by the name of tb« lord Strathnaver, was constantly attached to king William, and had followed him in all his campaigns in Flanders, at the head of a regiment. He had appeared very zealous for the privileges of the Scots; and did not think the onion ae* trimenta lthereto. The earl of Stair was already. employed by the new government as well as the dukes of Montrose and Roxburgh, and their attachment to it was not doubted. The only one that seemed exceptionable in the list was the lord Beihaven. No man had so strenuously opposed the union, and, had his advice beeii followed, it would never have taken place. But, finding at length ah opposition in vain, he gave way to the torrent. There was one thing capable of making amends for alibis non-compliances, and that was his singly opposing, in the presence of the duke of York, the act of succession passed fyr a majority of voices in favour of that prince. He was also a good speaker, which will he always a great recommendation.

The elections for the House of Common# were made with almost equal success, and the Whigs bad the majority* Thus ad seemed qaies in Scotland, though a storm was then gathering

there, which broke out in less than a year. The design, was conducted more regularly than in England, and was better concealed. It was begun with ' endeavours for a remonstrance against the union; and the advice of the most famous lawyers were asked upon it, who declared the act of union contained several nullities, and to be very defective. The opposite party, to prevent a remonstrance so disagreeable to the court, were forced to consent there Should be no address of congratulation: and that, presented by the Kirk, had suffered great debates about the manner in which king William was mentioned, and had passed with much difficulty. The Highlanders were silent, and decared not themselves. It wa9 only known, that they were making provision of powder and ball.

FIRST SESSION of the FIFTH PARLIAMENT of GREAT BRITAIN.

Meeting of the New March

17, 1715. This day the New Parliament met at Westminster. His majesty, being seated on his royal throne, adorned with his 'crown and regal ornaments, and attended with his officers of state, the prince of Wales sitting in his place, and the lords in their robes, commanded the gentleman usher of the black rod to let the Commons know, “ It is his majesty's pleasure, they attend him immediately, in the House of Peers.” Who being come, the Lord Chancellor, receiving directions from his majesty, said,

u My lords, and gentlemen; I am commanded by his majesty to acquaint you, that his majesty does not intend to declare the causes of calling this parliament till there be a Speaker of the House of Commons. And therefore youj the gentlemen of the House of Commons, are to repair to the place where the Commons usually sit, and there proceed to the election of a fit person to be your Speaker; •whom you are to present to his majesty here, for his royal approbation, on Monday next, at twelve of the clock.”

Commons being returned to their-House ^

39] PAUL. HISTORY, 1 Gtonot

The Earl of Hartford, son and heir apparent to the dujte of Somerset, said; That, the House having received his majesty’s commands to return, and immediately choosd a Speaker; although he was himself very unfit to recommend any person; yet he should take upon him to name one, of whose abilities and virtues, he thought, no one need be better convinced, though it very ill became him to* recommend:and thereupon the hon. Spencer Compton, esq. who had already madeknown his experience in the house, and given so many occasions of knowing his abilities in every thing of that kind; and as he had already, with the greatest honour, filled the chair of the committee of privileges and elections, which, next to that of the Speaker’s, is the highest we have; there was no occasion to say more Of him; and therefore moved, that Spencer Compton, esq. might take the chair of the house.

Lord Finch, * son and heir apparent to t the earl of Nottingham, said, That, after the honourable mention, which the noble member had been pleased to make of Mr. Compton, whose abilities were so well known to every gentleman in the bouse, his addition would be a mis-spending of time:but, however, on this occasion, -he could not b\it take notice of him, as he was a person descended of a very noble, and honourable family, in all times famous for "their steady adherence to the constitution in church and state; for their inviolable loyalty to a deserving master, though an unfortunate prince; that he had eminently distinguished himself in the true interest of his Country, by his firmly adhering to, and supporting with resolution, those measures, that were necessary to maintain the protestant succession, when in the utmost danger; upon which alone the security of the church of England, the protestant religion abroad, and the liberties of his country, could depend; without which, they might not have had an opportunity this day to choose a Speaker: That, by these virtues, and his great abilities in parliamentary affairs, he had so well deserved of his country, as to merit all marks of esteem that they could shew him: that he had already discharged the duty of the second chair, when intrusted with the rights and liberties of the Commons, with such temper, candour, and impartiality, as must satisfy every gentleman in the house, that he will support the dignity of the chair, and shew himself entirely equal to the trust they should repose in him. Unless such merit fills the chair, in vain would it be for a Speaker, at the bar of another house, to insist upon the rights and privileges of. parliaments, freedom of speech, and liberty of debating; for it would ever be in the breast of a Speaker to obstruct that freedom of speech which the crown has not a right to deny: since, therefore, to complete his character, he has already distinguished himself by these virtues, so necessary to every one who is to preside in a

I. 1715. — Choice of a Speaker, [40

free assembly, be begged leave to second the motion.” .

Then Mr. Compton stood up in his place, and said, “ That excuses upon these occasions were generally so much suspected, that notwithstanding the just sense he had of his own inabilities, he should have chose to have sat silent, and submitted himself to the pleasure of the house, had nothing but his own reputation, however dear that was to him, been concerned in the decision of this question:but when lie considered, that the future prosperity and tranquillity of this kingdom would entirely depend on many difficult and important points, which must necessarily come under the consideration'of this parliament, he must own he trembled, lest the just expectation the nation had of relief, of security, and of future happiness, from the deliberations of this bouse of Commons, stould be any-ways obstructed, if not disappointed, by his want of capacity; and that he should therefore think himself inexcusable, did he not lay before gentlemen how unequal he found himself to so great a weight: and since there were so many gentlemen in this house (he might venture to say there never were more in any house of Commons ), whose experience, added to their abilities, did fitly qualify them to promote those great and good purposes, which he was sure, every gentleman in the house proposed for tire service of his country, from the determination of this parliament, he should hope he might be allowed to sit down, ' perfectly satisfied with the honour of having been proposed by two honourable persons, who were the ornaments 6f the last parliament; and whose steady adherence' to the true interest of their country added a lustre even to their birth:and that gentlemen would agree on some other person, whose greater abilities wOuld enable him to discharge this high trust, with reputation to himself, and ad-wantage to the public.”

Eut, the house calling upon Mr. Compton, “ To the chair; ” he was taken out of his place by the earl of Hartford, and the lord Finch, who led him from the bar of the house, up to the chair: where upon the steps, be said, “ that the undeserved honour he had received, by being brought thus far, require the utmost return of gratitude to the whole-house, and his most hearty thanks U> every member of it; and would stop him from farther insisting on hie own insufficiency, lest he should be thought to censure the judgment of the house the real sense of his own weakness still urged him to in* treat gentlemen to desist from so improper a choice; and to give him leave to return to his former seat, where the errors he might commit could be only unfortunate to himself; whereas, in the chair, they might be prejudicial to the whole kingdom.”

But the house cried, No/no: whereupon Mr. Compton took the chair; and, the mace, which . before lay under the table, - being laid upon the table, be, standing up, said, ' though the house would not allow of his excuse, he hoped they would be pleased to permit

[42

him to intercede with his majesty^ to command them to proceed to another election.” The members cried, No, no; and thereupon he sat down in the pbair.

The Speaker's Speech on being presented and approved of.] March SI. The king catne to the House of Lords with the usual solemnity; and the House of Commons attending, . the Speaker elect addressed his majesty, as follows:

“ May it please your majesty; The Commons of Great Brirain, in parliament assembled, have, in obedience to your majesty’s command, proceeded to the choice of their Speaker; and now attend, with all humility, to present me to your majesty, as the effect of that choice. It must be very surprising to your majesty, that, from amongst so many honourable, learned, and worthy persons, who are every way qualified to discharge this great trust, any thing could induce your Commons to present me for your majesty’s approbation, who have none of those endowments necessary for the execution of this important charge:I have neither memory to retain, judgment to collect, nor skill to guide, their debates; nor can I boast of any thing that could entitle me to the .favor of the Commons, hut an unshaken fidelity to the Protestant succession. This, Sir, to your faithful Commons, supplied the want of all qualifications:by this first step, they design to convince the world, that a steady adherence to the interest of your majesty’s royal house is the only recommendation to the favour of the Commons. This your Commons hope, may be some excuse for their presuming to preseut to your majesty a person, whose insufficiency renders him so improper for them to elect, or for your majesty to approve; But though your majesty should be graciously pleased to allow this as a justification for your Commons; yet I should be unpardonable, did I not, with all humility, represent to your majesty, that, though my zeal be great, my infirmities are greater. This employment requires a man of better understanding, and stronger judgment, than I am master of: I am therefore an bumble suitor to your majesty, to accept my excuse; and to command the knights, citizens, and burgesses, to return to their House, and there to make choice of some fitter person to discharge this great trust, on the due execution whereof the public welfare so much depends.” .

Then the Lord Chancello, taking directions from his majesty, said,

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons; — I am to- acquaint you, by his majesty’s ..command, that his majesty is perfectly well satisfied with the choice you have made of Mr. Compton to be your Speaker; and therefore his majesty doth allow of, and confirm you, Mr. Compton, to be Speaker of the House of Commons.

Then the Speaker said,

“ Since it is not your majesty’s pleasure to admit my excuse; it is my duty to submit, and chearfully to undergo this burden, which your

majesty and the Commons have been pleased to lay on me; having an entire confidence in your majesty’s goodness for pardon for my errors and infirmities, at least that they may not be imputed to your faithful Commons:On whose behalf I lay claim, by humble petition to your majesty, to all their ancient rights and privileges; particularly, that they may have privilege from arrests, and disturbance, for their persons, estates, and servants, liberty of speech for the better management of their debates, and free access to your majesty’s royal person, as occasion shall require.”

* Then the Lord Chancellor receiving further directions from his majesty, said,

“ Mr. Speaker; 1 am commanded by his majesty to say, that his majesty, being fully assured of the prudence, loyalty, and good affections, of the House of Commons, does most willingly grant to them all their privileges, in as full a manner as they have at any time been granted or allowed^ by any of his majesty’s royal predecessors. And as to what you have prayed in relation to yourself, his majesty will he graciously pleased to put the best and most favourable construction upon your words and actions, in execution of this great trust, as Speaker of the House of Commons; being satisfied, by your past conduct, of your good intentions and zeal for his service, and the true interest of your country, and of your experience and abilities in the business of parliaments.”

The King's Speech on opening the £esiion.] Then his majesty was pleased to say,

My Lords and Gentlemen; — I have ordered my lord chancellor to declare to you in my name and words, the causes of calling this parliament.”

Then the Lord Chancellor, receiving directions from his majesty, said,

“ My Lords, and Gentlemen; — His ^majesty hath commanded me to declare to you the causes of his calling this parliament, as they are contained in, this his majesty’s most gracious Speech, now delivered into my hands by his majesty, from the throne. /

“ My Lords, and Gentlemen; This being the first opportunity that I have had of meeting my people in parliament, since it pleased Almighty God^ of his good Providence, to call me to the throne of my ancestors, I most gladly make use of it, to thank my faithful and loving subjects for that zeal and firmness that' hath been shown in defence of the Protestant succession, against all the open and secret practices that, have been used to defeat it; and I shall never forget the obligations I have to those who have distinguished themselves upon this occasion.

“It were to be wished, (hat the unparalleled successes of a war, which was so wisely and cheerfully supported by this nation, in order to procure a good peace, had been attended with a suitable conclusion t but it is with concern

by

43] PARL. HISTORY, 1 George I. 171 [44

I must tell you, that some conditions, even of this peace, essential to the security and trade, of Great Britain, are not yet duly executed; and the performance of the whole may be look* ed upon as precarious, until we shall have form* ed defensive alliances to guaranty the preseut treaties.

“ The Pretender, who still resides in Lorrain, threatens to disturb us:and boast3 of the assistance which he still expects here, to repair his former disappointments.

“ A great part of our trade is rendered impracticable:this, if not retrieved, must destroy our manufactures, and ruin our navigation.

“Thepublic debts are very great, and sup- prisiugly increased, even since the fatal cessation of arms. My first care was, to prevent a farther increase of these debts, by paying off forthwith a great number of ships, which had been kept in pay when there was no occasion for continuing such an expence.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons,

, “ I rely on you for such supplies as the present circumstances of our affairs require for this year’s service, and for the support of the public faith:the estimates shall be laid before you, that you may consider of them:and what you shall judge necessary for your safety, I shall think sufficient for mine.

. “I doubt not but you will concur with me in opinion, that nothing can contribute more to the support of the credit of the nation, than a strict observance of all parliamentary engagements.

“ The branches of the revenue, formerly granted for the support of the civil government, are so far incumbered and alienated, that the produce of the funds which remain, and have been granted to me, will fall much short of what was at first designed for maintaining the honour and dignity of the crown: and since it is my happiness (as I am confident you think it yours) to see a Prince of Wales, who may in due time succeed me on the throne, and to see him blessed with many children, the - best afod most valuable pledges of our care and concern for yeur prosperity, this must occasion an expence^ to which the nation has not of many years been accustomed, but such as sorely no mau will grudge; and, therefore, I do not doubt but you will think of it with that affection which I have reason to hope for from you.

“ My lords and gentlemen *

“ The eyes of all Europe are upon you; waiting the issue of this first session. Let no unhappy divisions of parties here at home, divert you from pursuing the common interest of your country. Let no wicked insinuations disquiet the minds of my subjects. The established constitution, in church and state, shall be the rule of my government; the happiness, ease, and prosperity of my people, shall be the chief care of my life. Those who assist me, in carrying on these measures, I shall always esteem my best friends; and I doubt uot but that ! shall be able, with your assistance, to

disappoint the designs of those who would deprive me of that blessing which I most valuer the affection of my people.”

Which being ended, his majesty was pleased to withdraw; and the Commons returned to their House.

The Lords' Address.] March 22. The Duke of Bolton reported from the Lords Committees appointed to draw an address, to be presented to his majesty, “ That they had drawn an address accordingly, as follows:

Most Gracious Sovereign,

“ We, your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled, beg leave to present to your majesty most humble and hearty (hanks, for your majesty’s most gracious speech to your houses of parliament; and to assure your majesty, that although we met together with hearts deeply sensible of the goodness of divine Providence to us, in bringing your majesty with safety, and at so critical a juncture, to the throne of your ancestors, yet we could not but become still more affected with that inestimable blessing, when we heard so very affectionate expressions from your majesty towards your people; so clear and full assurances, from a Prince of such known honour and justice, that the established constitution in church and state shall be the rule of your government'; and so just and tender a concern for our not having obtained those advantages by the peace, which would have been but a suitable conclusion to so glorious and successful a war; nor as yet a due execution of some conditions, even of that peace, essential to the security arid trade of this kingdom.

“ We are affected with wonder, as well as with a just resentment, that a Pretender to your majesty’s crown should be yet permitted to reside so near your dominions; especially after his public boasting of an assistance hie expects here, and his avowing a design to invade this your majesty’s kingdom.

“ We are but too sensible that our trade is rendered impracticable in the most valuable branches of it, and of the ill effects that must have upon our manufactures and navigation: but your majesty may be assured, nothing shall be wanting on oor part, that may any way conduce to the retrieving it.

“ These and other difficulties your majesty hath met with on your accession to the crown (and which, we must observe, injustice to your wisdom and foresight, would have been pre-, vented had your opinion been followed ), we must confess, are very great and discouraging; However we do not doubt1 but that your majesty, assisted by this parliament, zealous for your government, and the Safety and honour of their country, may be able to take such further measures, as will secure what is due to us by treaties, ease our debts, preserve the public credit, restore our trade, extinguish the very hopes of the Pretender, and recover' the reputation of this kingdom in foreign parts;

U] PAUL. HISTORY, 1 George:

the loss of which, we hope to convince the world by our actions, is by no means to be imputed to thp nation in general;

“ And these good ends cannot fail of being obtained, by your majesty's pursuing with steadiness, as you have begun, the true interest of this your obedient and affectionate people: and your majesty may, by God’s blessing, depend that in conjunction with so loyal a parliament, you will be able to lay foundations that can never be moved, not only of the security and glory, but even of the ease and tranquillity of your government, and that of your majesty’s posterity; for which we offer up our most ardent prayers, that it may for ever continue to reign after your majesty on the throne of these kingdoms, and in the hearts of a people truly happy, and fully sensible of their being •o.”

Debate thereon.] As soon as the Address had been read, there rose a great debate about the following expressions, “ And recover the reputation of this' kingdom in foreign parts; the loss of which we hope to convince the world by our actions, is, by no means, to be imputed to the nation in general, ” The lord Trevor (aJ, lord Bolingbroke (b ), the earl of Strafford (c ), dukes of Buckingham (and Shrewsbury (e)t earl of Anglesea, the archbishop of York If)the bishops of London and Bristol (h ), excepted against that clause, alledging, “ that the same was injurious to the late queen’s memory, and even clashing with that part of his majesty’s speech which recommended to both houses, the avoiding the unhappy divisions of parties.”

The Lord Bolingbroke expressed the deepest concern for the memory of the late queen, which, be'said, “ he would do all in his power to vindicate; that he had the honour to be one of her servants, and if he had had done any thing amiss he would be contented to be punished for it; but that he thought it very hard to be censured and condemned without being heard.” His lordship added, “that his present majesty had*several times expressed a great respect and tenderness for the late queen’s memory; and was a prince of so great wisdom, equity, and

justice, that, he was sure his majesty would not condemn any man, without hearing what he had to say for himself; that so august an assembly ought to imitate so great a pattern.’' And upon these and other reasons, his lordship moved, “ That the words recover, ’ &c. might be softened into.those of maintain the. reputation of this kingdom, ’ and that thereat of the paragraph might be left out.”

The Earl of Strafford also excepted against that clause, urging, “ that the same would expose the honour of the nation abroad, which he was sure, had suffered no diminution during his negociations.”

The Duke of Shrewsbury said, “ that the. House of Peers ought, on all occasions, to be most tender of the honour and dignity of the' crown, from which they derive their own honour and lustre; that therefore, when the like, clause was inserted in an Address of the House of Commons to the late queen, upon the death of king William *, he had expressed, to several members of that house, his dislike of it, because it reflected on the memory of that prince; and for the same reason he was against the said clause. — These were answered by the marquis ' of Wharton, f the lord Cowper, J the earls of Nottingham and Aylesford, and the duke of . Devonshire; who expressed all respect and reverence for the late queen’s memory, but distinguished between her and her ministry; and maintained the clause in question by arguments drawn from the mismanagements of the latter, hinted at in his majesty’s speech. Lord Cowper said, “ They did not condemn any particular person, but only the peace in general, because they felt the ill consequences of it; that they who advised and blade such a peace, deserved indeed to be censured* but that the words in the Address being general, no private person was affected by them:and that the alteration of the word recover’ into that of maintain, ’ would signify no more towards the justification of the guilty, than the word recover’ towards the condemnation of the innocent.” Then the question being put, whether the Address should be recommitted or not, the negative carried it by a majority of 66 votes against 33.

The King's Answer to the Lords' .]

March 23. The House of Lords in a body presented the said Address to the king, who returned the following Answer;

“ My lords; I thank you heartily for this Address. Your duty and loyalty to me can never be better expressed, than by shewing a just concern for the reputation and interest of the nation; since I have no other thought, or view, but to promote the prosperity and^ happiness of my people.”

- The Commons1 Address.] March 23d. The Speaker .having reported to the House the king's Speech:-

Mr. Robert Walpole made a speech in which he set forth the great happiness of these nations by his majesty's seasonable accession to the crown; ran through the mismanagements of the four last preceding years; and concluded with a inotion for an Address of thanks to the king) conformable to the several heads of his majesty's speech. He was seconded by the lord Hinchmbroke) member for Huntingdon; and none but sir William Whitlocke, member for the university of Oxford, having raised any objection against Mr. Walpole's motion, it was resolved, That an Address be presented to his majesty; and a committee was appointed to draw it up, of which Mr. Walpole was elected chairman; which was as follows':

“ Most gracious sovereign;

“ Your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal sub* jects the Commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, return your majesty their unfeigned thanks for your most gracious speech from the throne.

“ It is with inexpressible joy that we approach your majesty, peaceably seated upon the throne of your royal ancestors; and being thoroughly sensible of the many open and secret practices that have of late years been used to defeat the Protestant Succession, we cannot sufficiently adore the Divine Providence, that so seasonably interposed, and saved this nation by your majesty's happy accession to the crown, v “ Your faithful Commons receive with the highest gratitude, your most gracious assurances, that the established constitution in church and state shall be the rule of your government; and the safety, ease, .and prosperity of your people the chief care of your life. We are sensible of your goodness expressed to those who have distinguished themselves by their zeal and firmness for the Protestant succession: And as we doubt not, but the wisdom and steadiness of your government will unite the hearts of all your faithful subjects in duty and affection to your sacred person, so we most humbly beg leave to assure your majesty, that we not only highly resent tjie wicked insinuations used to disquiet the minds of your subjects, but are resolved, to the utmost of our power, to suppress and extinguish that evil disposition that is still at work to deprive your majesty of the affections of your people.

“ We are sensibly touched, not only with , jjhe ‘ disappointment, but with the % reproach brought on the nation by the unsuitable conclusion of a war, which was carried on at so vast an expence, and was attended with such unparalleled successes: But as that dishonour panhot in justice be impute^ to the whole nation, so we firmly hope and believe, that through your majesty's great wisdom, and the faithful endeavours of your Cofiraons, the reputation of these your kingdoms will iu due time be vindicated agd restored.

1715The Commons' .

“We are under astonishment to find, that any conditions of the late peace, essential to the security and trade of Great Britain, should not be duly executed; and that care was not taken to form such alliances, as might have rendered that peace not precarious. And as no care shall be wanting in your loyal Commons to enquire into these fatal miscarriages, so- we entirely rely on your majesty's wisdom^ to enter into such alliances as you shall judge necessary to preserve the peace of Europe; and we faithfully promise to enable your nun jesty to make good all such engagements.

“ It is with just resentment we observe, that the Pretender still resides in Lorrain, and that he has the presumption, by declarations from thence, to stir up your majesty's subjects to rebellion; But that" which raises the utmost indignation of your Commons is, that it appears therein, that his hopes were built upon the measures that had been taken for some time past in Great Britain. It shall be our business to trace out those measures whereon he placed his hopes, and to bring the authors of them to condign punishment.

“ Your Commons are under the deepest concern, that a great part of our trade is rendered impracticable, which if not retrieved, " must destroy our manufactures, and ruin our navigation:But though we are too sensible of those fatal consequences, we are not yet without hopes, that your majesty’s great wisdom, by the assistance of your Commons, may find means to extricate your people from their present difficulties.

“ The blessings derived to these nations from your majesty's auspicious reign, are not confined to the present times; we have a prospect of future and lasting happiness entailed upon your people by a long succession of your royal progeny. And as this is a blessing which these kingdoms have a long time wanted, so they could never hope to have seen it so well supplied, as in the person of his royal highness the prince of Wales, and his issue. Your faithful Commons shall therefore think it their duty to enable your majesty to support the dignity of the crown, and to make an honourable provision for the royal family.

“ The surprising increase of the public debts, even sirice all thoughts of carrying on the war were laid aside, shall not discourage us from granting such supplies as shall be necessary for the service of this year, and the support of public faith:And we do entirely concur with your majesty in opinion, that nothing can contribute more towards preserving the Credit of the nation, than a strict observanpe of ail parliamentary engagements, which we are firmly resolved upon all occasions inviolably to maintain."

Debate thereon.] Upon the reading' of this Address, there arose a warm debate in the-House; Mr. Shippen, Mr. Bromley, sir Wit liam Wyndham, general Ross, Mr. G»sar,

* 9] PARL. HISTORY, 1 6»hige L 1715* — -7fce {50

Ward, sir Robert Raymond, sir William1 1 Whitlocke, Mr. Hunger ford, and some others, j raised objections against divers expressions ini the Address; but were answered by Mr. Ro- i bertWalpole, Mr.Secretary Stanhope f, sir; .Gilbert Heathoote, and Mr. William Pulteney. I

General Ross, among the rest, insisted much, ' 94 That the condemning the peace, and censuring'the late ministry, was a reflection on the late queen, whose act and deed the peace was; and that‘he was sure the reflecting on the late queen, could not be agreeable to his present majesty.* '

He was answered by Mr. Robert Walpole, and general Stanhope, “ That nothing was iarther {rom their intentions, than to asperse the late queen; that they rather designed to vindicate her memory, by exposing and punishing those evil counsellors who deluded her into pernicious measures; whereas the opposite party endeavoured to screen and justify those counsellors, by throwing on that good, pious, •and well meaning princess, all the blame and odium of their evil counsels.7' As to censuring the late ministers, without hearing them, and condemning the peace, without examining •into.particulars, asuqjustand unprecedented, it was answered, “ That they must distinguish between censuring ministers, and condemning the peace in general, and condemning particular persons. That they might, in equity and justice, . do the -first, because the whole nation is already sensible, that'their honour and true interest were given up by the late peace; that in due time they would call them to an account, who made and advised such a peace; but God forbid they should ever condemn any person unheard.* On this occasion,

General Stanhqoe took notice of a report, industriously spread abroad, *< That the present ministers .never designed to call the late managers to an account, but only.to censure them in general terms:but be assured the House, that notwithstanding all the endeavours that bad been used to prevent a discovery of the late mismanagements, by conveying away several papers from the secretaries offices, yet the government had sufficient evidence left to prove the late ministry the most corrupt that ever sate at the helm; That those matters would soon be laid before the House: and that it' would appear, that a certain English general had acted in concert with, if not reoeitved orders from, Marshal Villare.”

~ Sir William Wyndham endeavoured to prove, that the peace had been very beneficial to this kingdom, and offered to produce a list of goods, by which it appeared, that the customs had in-

creased near 100,000?. per annum. But be was immediately taken up by

Sir Gilbert Heathcotef who readily owned, sir William might, indeed, produce a list of vast imports from France, but defied him to shew that oar exports thither, particularly of out woollen manufactures, had encreased since the peace. He added, that imports being only oar consumption, rather prove our loss than our gain; and that the nation gets only by exports, which keep up our manufactures, employ v our poor, and bring in returns in money; to which sir William Wyndham made no reply.

Sir William Whitelocke having suggested, that, the new ministry designed to involve the nation in a new war, and lay 6*. in the pound, was assured by Mr. Robert Walpole, that none in the present ministry were for a war, if the same could any Ways be avoided; and that he doubted not, but 2s. in the pound would be sufficient towards this year’s Service.

After this debate, a motion being made, and the question put, that the Address of thanks « be recommitted, it passed in the negative, by 244 voices against 138; and then it was resolved, That the House do agree with the Committee in the said Address; and ordered, that such members asareof theprivy council, should know his majesty's pleasure, when, he would be attended by the House.

The Kings Answer.] ’The king having appointed the next day, the Commons, with their Speaker, attended his majesty accordingly at1 St. James’s, with their Address, to which his majesty returned the following Answer:

“ Gentlemen; I thank you for the many kind assurances you have given me in your dutiful and loyal Address. — No endeavours shall be wanting on my party ro promote your true interest, and endear myself to all my peoples and Twill depend on your zeal and affection, to defeat all evil designs, that may tend to disquiet the minds of iny people, and disturb the tranquillity of my governuic lit.”

The Kings Proclamation for calling the Parliament objected, against.] April s. The House being moved.to appoint a day for taking into consideration the King’s Proclamation of the 15th of January last for calling a new parliament, and the same being read accordingly,

Sir William Whitelocke made some exceptions to the said Proclamation; as unprecedented and nnwarrantable, for which he was called upon by some mem berg to explain himself; upon Which he made an excuse for what he bad said.

The passages here alluded to are as follows, viz. ‘ We cannot omit, on this occasion of first

* summoning our parliament of Great Britain,

* in justice to ourselves, and that the miscar-

* riages of others may not be imputed to us, at a ‘ time when false impressions may dothe greatest

Motion jor committing Sir W. Windham to the Tower.] This dispute would have been dropped, had not

Sir William Windham even carried the matter farther, by advancing, that the said Proclamation was not only unprecedented and unwarrantable, bat even of dangerous consequence to the very being of parliaments. The courtiers could not but take notice of so home a reflection, and thereupon called upon Sir William Windham to justify his chaise; but sir William, who judged be could not descend to particulars, without giving farther offence, declined explaining himself; though at the same time, lie resolutely maintained his first assertion, saying, 44 That as he thought some expressions in the said proclamation of dangerous consequence, so he believed every member was free to speak his thoughts."

Lord Finch said. No doubt but every member has that liberty, freedoiq of speech being one oft he essential privileges of that House; but that the House has, at the same time, both the liberty and power to censure and punish such members as trangress the rules of decency, trespass upon the respect due to the crown, and so abuse the privileges.of the House within doors, as to render it contemptible without.

Sir William being again called uppn to explain himself, and still persisting in his refusal, some members cried the Tower, the Tower; ' but

Mr.t Robert Walpole warded off the blow by words to the following purpose, 44 Mr. Speaker, I am not for gratifying the desire which the member, who occasions this great debate, shews of being sent to the Tower; it would make him too considerable: but as he is a young man of good parts, who sets up for a warm champion of the late ministry, and one who was in all their secrets, I would have hiin be it) the House when we come to enquire into the conduct, of his friends, both that he may have an oppprtunity to defend them, and be a witness of the fairness with which we shall proceed against those gentlemen; and that it may

not be said, that we take any advantage a'gaiarft them."

After several other speeches, which prolonged this debate from one till half an hour past fir* in the afternoon, a motion was made, and the question put. That the House do now adjourn, which being carried in the negative by a majority of 212 voices against. 134, a motion was made, and the question proposed, “ That sir William Windham having reflected upon hip majesty's proclamation of the 15th of January last, for calling a new parliament, and having refused to justify his charge, although often called upon so to do, is guilty of a great indignity to his majesty, and of a breach of the privilege of the House."

This motion occasioned a fresh debate, that lasted till seven of the clock; the courtiers still insisting, that sir William Windham should justify his charge, and sir William as resolutely declining to do it, saying, he was ready to undergo whatever a majority might think fit to inflict upon him. At last the question being put. That sir William Windham should withdraw, the same was carried in the affirmative by 208 voices against 129, whereupon sir William withdrew accordingly; and with him, to a man, all the 129 members who had been for the negative.

Their antagonists being thus entire masters of the field, the question was put and unanimously resolved, “ThatSir William Windham, having reflected upon his majesty's proclamation of the 15th of January last, for calling a new parliament, and having refused to justify his charge, although often called upon so to do, is guilty of a great indignity to his majesty, and of a breach of the privilege of the House." After which it was ordered. That sir William Windham be, for the said offence, reprimanded in his place by Mr. Speaker: and that he should attend the House in his place the next morning.

Sir W. Windham reprimanded by the Speaker.] April 6. Sir William, Windham attending in his place, according to order;

The Speaker called upon him by his name, (Mr. Speaker sitting in the chair covered); and, sir William Windham standing up in his place uncovered, Mr. Speaker spoke to him to the effect following:

44 Sir William Windham, I am to acquaint you, that yesterday, after you were withdrawn, the House came to this Resolution:‘ That sir William Windham, having reflected upon his majesty's proclamation, of the 15th of January last, for calling a new parliament and having refused to justify his charge, although often called upon so to do; is guilty of a great indignity to his majesty, and of a breach of the privilege of this HouseSir, the arraigning a Proclamation, issued by his majesty, for calling this present parliament; and refusing to assign any cause, why such proclamation is blameable; the House thought an indignity to his majesty, and so unwarrantable an use -of

5?] PAUL. HISTORY, 1 George I. 1715. — Sir IT. Windham reprimanded. [54

that freedom of speech, which is the undoubted, privilege of parliament, that the House thought they could not, let it pass without animadversion; but, being willing their moderation should appear, notwithstanding their lenity has been too much despised and contemned, they have ioflicted the mildest censure, your offence was capable of; and have commanded me to reprimand you in your place; and in obedience to their command, I do reprimand you accordingly."

Whereupon Sir William said,

u Mr. Speaker; I very truly return my thanks to you for performing that duty which is incumbent upon you, from your office, in so candid and gentleman-like a manner. — As lama member I know I must acquiesce in the determination of the House; but, as I am not conscious to myself of having offered any indignity to his majesty, or of having been guilty of any breach of the privilege of this House, I have no thanks to return to those gentlemen who, under a pretence of lenity, have' brought me under this censure.”

Motion for appointing a Committee, to inquire into the late Peace, and the Management

of the late Queen's Ministry, '] April 9. Mr. Secretary Stanhope presented to the House, pursuant to their Address to his majesty for that purpose, on the 31st of March, all the Powers, Instructions, Memorials, Papers, &c. relating to the late Negotiation of Peace and commerce, and to the late cessation of arms, which he delivered in at the table, and told the House, “ That nothing had been omitted, that might either answer the desire they bad expressed of being thoroughly informed of what bad passed in those important negotiations, or to satisfy the whole world, that the present ministry acted with the utmost fairness and candour, and designed to take no manner of advantage over the late managers in the intended inquiries: That, indeed, the papers now laid before the House were only copies, but that the originals would beproduced if occasion required:concluding, That those papers being too many, and too voluminous to -be peruse^ and examined by all the members of the House, he thought it more convenient, and therefore moved, that the said books and papers be referred to a Select Committee of twenty persons, who should digest the substance of them under proper heads, and report the same, with their observations thereupon to the House.”

Mr. Ward said, Nothing could be fairer. That for his own part, though his principle was that kings can do no wrong, yet he was of opi-z nion, that ministers were accountable for their mal-administration.

Mr. Edward Harley stood up, and said,

* One of the auditors of the Imprest, and brother to the earl of Oxford. “ The conduct of the earl of Oxford and the lord Bolingbroke, the two chiefs of the late ministry, was at this lime very remarkable. The carl skulked about

1 “ That it was easy to see that one of his nearest relations was principally aimed at, in the intended inquiries; but he might.assure the house, that the said person, notwithstanding the

sometimes in town, and sometimes in the country; affecting to appear very unconcerned, professing his innocepce, and boasting what great things he had done for securing the Hanover succession. The other affected to act a more open part, appeared every where, and spoke iu parliament with such boldness, as if he had not the least sense of guilt, or dread of punishment. This was said to be owing to the advice of the lord Trevor, who represented to’him, “ How much their cause would suffer, if he, whose chief interest it was to support it to the last, should meanly throw it up, by absenting himself. He assured him, no hold could be taken of his person till he was impeached; which he could not be, till the papery relating to the part of the administration, in which be was concerned, were examined.” However, it was observed, that the earl of Oxford sold out all the stock he had in his own name in the south-sea company:and the lord Boiinghroke’s heart began to fail him, as soon as he heard, that Mr. Prior was landed at Dover, and had premised to reveal all he knew: which however he did not make good, though he was favourably received by the king, to whom be was introduced by the earl of Dorset; and, the same day, was entertained at dinner by the lord Townshend, together with the duke of Roxburgh, Mr. secretary Stanhope, the earl of Dorset, and the lord Lumley. That evening the lord Bolingbroke, who had the night before appeared at the play-house in Drury-Lane, and bespoke another play for the next night, and subscribed to a new opera, that was to be acted some time after, went off Dover in disguise, as a servaiit to la Vigne, one of the French king’s messengers; and there William Morgan, who had been a captain m major-general Holt’s regiment of marines; hired a vessel, and carried him over to Calais, where the governor attended him in a coach, and carried him to his bouse, as appeared by Morgan’s examination. The next day alter it was publicly known, that he was gone to France, there was handed about in writing and afterwards in print, the following letter said to be writ by him:

* My lord; ', March

various reports which had been spread concerning biro, would neither fly his country, nor conceal himself, but be forth-coming whenever be should be called upon to justify his conduct. That he hoped he would be able upon the severest trial; to make his innocence appear te all the world; but if he should be so unhappy as to have been guilty of the crimes that were laid to his charge, he would think all his blood too small a sacrifice to atone for them.” Nobody opposed general Stanhope’6 mottdn:Mr. Hungerford only excepted against the number of 20, and moved that one more might be added; which was agreed to, audit was resolved, “That the papers before-mentioned be referred to a committee of 21.

I challenge the most inveterate of‘ 4 my enemies to produce any one instance of criminal correspondence, or the least cor- ruptioniu any part of the administration, in which I was concerned. If my zeal for the honour and dignity of my royal mistress, and the true inteiest of my country, has any where transported me to let slip a warm or unguarded expression, I hope the most favourable ihter- pretation will be put upon it. It is a comfort, that will remain with me in all rnisfor- tunes, that I served her majesty faithfully and dutifully, in that especially, which she had most at heart, relieving her people from a 4 Bloody and expensive war; and that I have always been too much an Englishman, to sacrifice the interest of my country to any foreign ally whatsoever. And it is for this crime only, that l am now driven from thence.

‘ Some maintained this letter to be supposititious, but the|generolity of the Tories orwued it to be true. And it plainly appeared afterwards, that he had just reasons to leave the kingdom.” Tiudal.

* 44 On the 11th of April the earl of Oxford went to the parliament, and took* his seat in the House of Peers. Abput this time the earl of Peterborough suddenly returned from his late travels to Italy and France, having met with the lord Bolingbrake on the road between Paris and Calais; but it was said, lie did not 3peak to him. The next day after his arrival, the earl appeared at St. James's, but, whatever was the occasion, two days after the lord Townshend signified to him an order forbidding him the court.

He saw and heard the designs, of a., prince, to whose indolence and, luxury the nar tion was obliged for its preservation; This gave him a just contempt for such a governor, and an abhorrence of all his views. King Wil* liam was duly sensible of his services before and at the revolution. In that reign he attained, to no higher a station than being comptroller of the household; which must be ascribed to the unhappy influence of those, who hated him; andf his royal master. He received however the utmost proofs of confidence and respect, and bad' the king's most intimate designs communicated* to him. His probity and good affection in what* concerned the government was so well assured; that it gave him great and constant interests Many important measures were ascribed'to his secret advice. His great vigour and happy address in serving the good cause, which he had ever in view, cannot fully be described. His labours were infinite with men of all ranks, and on all proper occasions. He knew how to accommodate himself to every temper and incli* nation. What to others would have been great pain and trouble, afforded him great pleasure and satisfaction. The merit of his conduct in the country, at court, and in the senate, wat equally admirable. His enemies, who were1 only so on the account of his public Zealand usefulness, have greatly aggravated his immoralities, and loaded him with crimes, from which he was wholly free. Bat did he not learn the rudiments of vice under their favourite king Charles ? Have not the private lives of most of their leaders been equally faulty ? Are they excusable for pretending to the name and noise of religion ? Lord Wharton’s defects oblige us the more to admire his excellencies. In a life spent in a libertine manner, useful knowledge and learning were neglected. But an infinite fond of good sense and great natural abilities supplied' whatever was wanting. On every; emergency he discovered what was proper, and* was never at a loss how to act. There was only nor a readiness, and propriety in h is. speeches p but they were weighty and important. Nothing . can he imagined more excellent than his skill and sagacity in the management of a. debate. Hr these public appearances he was greatly assisted; by never engaging iir the* support of what br

crecy, resolved upon by the house; and report upon whom: the majority fell; that the majority had fallen upon the 21 persons following; viz. Sir Kichard Onslow, hart. Robert Walpole, Spencer Gowper, James' Stanhope, Hugh Bos-c&weri, William Pulteney, Nicholas Lech, mere, Daniel lord Finch, John Aiglaby, Thomas Vernon, Algernon, earl of Hertford, Edward Wortley Mountague; sir David Dalrym-ple, bark George Bailie, sir Joseph Jekyll, ktm Thomas Erie, Richard Hampden, Sir Robert Marsham, bart. Alexander Deaton, Thomas Pitt, sen. Thomas lord Cpningsby;

An objection being made by some members to sir Joseph Jekyll’s being one of the said committee* he having not. taken the oaths at the table; it was readily answered, that the same was not owing to any voluntary neglect, sir Joseph Jekyll being employed in the circuits, as judge of the county palatine of Chester. Whereupon it was resolved, That sir Joseph Jekyll being a member of this House, was capable of being chosen of the committee of secrecy, although he had not been sworn at the table; and it was also ordered, 1. “ That the books and. papers ordered to remain in the custody of the clerk, till this committee was chor sen, be delivered to the said committee; and that they do examine the same, and report to the House what they find material in them; and that they, or any five of them, do meet this afternoon, and sit ‘ de die in diem; ’ 2. That the said committee have power to send for persons, papers, and records/ ’

The committee of secrecy met that evening, and chose Mr. Robert Walpole their chairman; but that gentleman being the next day taken ill, * the committee chose Mr. Secretary Stanhope to supply his place of chairman, and for dispatch sake, subdivided themselves into three committees, to each of which ascertain number of books and papers were allotted.

Debate concerning the Civil Lis*-.] May 13. The committee of the whole House having examined the accounts laid before them, relating to thfe Civil List, in the- reigns of Charles 2, James 2, William 3, and; queen Anne, and other papers on that head, the courtiers offered the following question* viz. “ That it appears to this committee, that the sum of 700,000^ per annum was settled upon king William, during his life, for the support of his household, and

did not believe to have truth and justice on it* side. He lived to see the success of a cause, for which he had laboured; with zeal and integrity. But his enjoyment of the blessing of the succession was very short. A misfortune in hisfa-mily is supposed to- have produced the fatal effect. His son possessed some of his parts and abilities, but his very different use apdappli-catkm of them are well known/’ Tindal.

* “ As soon as the king was informed of Mr. Walpole’s indisposition, his majesty shewed a great concern for the health ofa person.of his abilities and merit, and sent his > physician to visit him/’ Oldmixon. '

other necessary occasions; and at the time of his demise* after the deduction of 3700/. a week, which wav applied to public uses, was* the produceof the Civil List revenues that were continued and settled upon-queen Anne, during her life.” Which question occasioned a warm and long-debate. Those who proposed it had two things principally in their view-; First, To vindicate-the present ministry from the aspersions* cast upon them* and industriously spread about, by-the-emissaries of thedate managers *, that the courtiers designed to give the king at larger revenue than his predecessors had enjoyed; and, second, To make good the branches of the revenue assigned for the support of the civiMist, which had been alienated, or abridged* so that the whole neat produce might, amount to the- sum of 700,000l. per annum.

The leading men among the Tories; being sensible of the first and pretending to be ignorant of the consequences of this preliminary question, insisted a long while* “ That it was ensnaring-: that what bad been done by former' parliaments ought not to be a standing rule for thesubsequent: that supposing the parliament, had given king William a revenue of 700,000l.. per annum for the civil list, they ought to consider, that he was to pay out of it 50,000l. per annum to the late queen, then princess of Denmark; 15 or 20,000 /. per annum to the late duke of Gloucester; and 40,000l. for the dowry of the late king James’s queen:that after the late queen’s accession to the throne, the parliament taking .notice that the' produce of thecivil list revenues exceeded what they had been given for; the sum of 3700/. per week, (that is 192*400/. per annunr) was taken oat of them, and applied to other uses; notwithstanding which deduction, the late queen had honourably maintained her family^ and supported the dignity of the crown:however if the present revenues of, the civil list were not' sufficient, they were ready to consent to an addition.”

The courtiers answered, “ That-the-question before them was founded upon facts; which, if denied, they were ready to prove by the re? cords of the House/ ’

Sir William Windham still urging that the question was ensnaring,

Mr. Secretary Stanhope answered, “'That Ho-would be very plain with them, and own, thalr as ’twas notorious* that great endeavours had been used to alienate the affections of the ueo=-pTe from the king and his government by false suggestions, that they designed to plunge* the' nation into extraordinary expences, they thought k highly necessary to clear his majesty and his ministersfrom that maliciousaspersion. To this the

Lord Guernsey replied; “That the-disaffectionr

of the people, if any, did not- proceed from Iris majesty, but from.the hardships his minister*' put on the friends of the late ministry.”

To which it was returned, “ That as soon-at it was made known to the world; how the late ministry had WdJ the whole nation, nothing

that could be done against them, would than be thought a hardship; but, however, that neither that npble member, nor any of his family, had reason to complain of hardships/ '

After some other speeches, which prolonged the debate from two till about five in the afternoon, the country party endeavoured to drop the question, by moving that the Speaker resume the chair; but the question being put upon this question, the same was carried in the negative by 244 voices against 143: after which, the first question was put, and carried in the affir-, mative by about the same majority.

Then the victorious party moved, “ That to. enable his majesty to support the dignity of the crown", and to make an honourable provision for the royal family, there be granted to his majesty, during his life, an additional revenue, which, together with the neat produce of the Civil List branches, may make up the clear yearly sum of 700,000l. for the service of his majesty’s household and family, and for his other necessary expences and occasions.”

The question being put upon this motion, the same occasioned another great debate. Sir Thomas llanmer, Mr. Bromley, sir William Wyndham, Mr. Caesar, Mr.Hungerford, and some other leading ffiembers of the late minis-try", who, on this occasion, were strengthened and backed by some epiinent members of the court party, did qot at first directly oppose the question, but insinuated, “ That before they / came to that resolution, it should be proper that a particular of the king's expences should be laid before the Hpuse.” Mr. Walpole, General Stanhope, Mr. Lechmere, and some other courtiers, who, on this occasion, were joined by some of the opposite part ^, having exploded that proposal as altogether inconsis1 tent with the king’s honour, to have all the private expences of his family and household looked into, as if he had need of a guardian, the country party then moved, that the sum of 600,000l. per annum be given to his majesty, and 100,000l. per annum settled on the prince of Wales. The courtiers perceiving that’the proposal of giving the prince of Wales a separate revenue, was only a design to divide the royal family, by lessening the next heir apparent’s dependence on the king, opposed it with great warmth; and the question being put upon that motion, the same was carried in the negative by a great majority. The country party having lost these two points, some of that party more openly opposed the main question; among the rest,

Sir William Wyndham said, “ He bad the honour to serve queen Anne, and bad the opportunity to look both into her revenue and expences; and he could assure the House, that about 500,000l. per annum, were sufficient for-the support of her family and civil list; though she reserved about 50,000l. a year for the late king J ames’s consort/’ The courtiers were glad of this last confession; and

Mr. Secretary Stanhope desired the Com-Blittee to take notice of what that gentleman

had advanced, because it would serve to con* firm some matters, which the Committee of Secrecy had found in the papers that were laid before them.

A courtier, who, at that time, spoke on the opposite side, made some reflections on the present unthrifty administration of his majesty’s reveuue; and, in particular, took notice of the salaries of the judges being advanced; not, said he, for services doue, but expected. Upon the whole matter, the question being put upon the motion before paen-tioned, about seven o’clock in the evening, the same was carried in the affirmative without dividing.

Debate concerning .] May 18.

The Commons resolved themselves into a Committee Of the whole House, to consider of the several lists and accounts of annuities, pensions, and bounties granted by the late queen, or his present majesty; upon which tnere arose a warm debate. The leading men among the friends of the late ministry, supported again by a great many courtiers, exclaimed against the pensions given by the crown to several persons of quality, some of whom they named who bad no occasion for them; and a motion was made, That an address be presented to his majesty, that he would be pleased to retrench all unnecessary pensions, and grant no more any such for the future. Hereupon,

Mr. Robert Walpole shewed, That they ought not to stint the king's beneficence, nor debar his majesty from the exercise of the most glorious branch of his royal prerogative, which is to bestow his favours on such as distinguish themselves in his service. He was seconded by,

Mr. Harhpdcn, who, on the other hand, observed, that all the pensions about which so much noise was made, did not amount to above 25,000l. a year; and to wave the motion made by the country party, he moved, That the chairman should leave the chair; which, being put-to the vote, passed in^he< affirmative, by 191 votes against 188; so that the court party carried it by three voices only.

700,000 Lper annum granted to the King for his Household.] May 23. The Commons, in a grand committee on the supply, came to this resolution, viz. That to enable his majesty to support the dignity of the crown, and to make an honourable provision for the royal family, there be granted., to his majesty, during his life, an additional revenue of 120,000l. per anQum:which, together with the neat produce of the civil list branches, may.make up the clear yearly sum of 700,000 I.for the service of his majesty’s houshold and family, and other his necessary expences and occasions. This resolution was reported on the 24th, and agreed to by the House.

Debate in thd Lords on a Bill to regulate the Land Forces.] May 30. The House of Lords in a grand Committee, considered of the bill

Gl] PARL. HISTORY, 1 George I. 1715. — Conspirators against King William. [62

for regulating the land-force*; when there arose a great debate about a clause, for confining the several regiments to those paits of his majesty’s dominions, for which they were allotted; for instance, the twelve thousand men that were on the Irish establishment, to Ireland. The duke of Bucks, the lord Trevor, the lord North and Grey, the bishop of Rochester, and some others of that party, spoke for the clause. But the duke of Marlborough and some other lords shewed the fatal conse-qoences, with which it might be attended, in case of an invasion from abroad, or an insurrection at home, by a number of enemies, foreign or domestic, superior to the number of forces actually on the spot, where either Of them should happen. It was further urged, “ That his majesty having trusted his person and family intirely in the hands of the nation, and at the opening of this session told the parliament, That what they should judge necessary for their safety, he should think sufficient for his own; the least they could do for him, was to leave to his wisdom and discretion the disposal of the few troops, that were kept on foot.” Some Tory Lords moved, that the foreign officers might be excluded from that number: But,

The Duke of Marlborough spoke in their favour, fand argued, uThat to exclude officers,

who, like the French refugees, had, for above five and twenty years, served England with distinguished zeal and untaiuted fidelity, would be a piece of injustice unprecedented in the most barbarous nations.”

After some other speeches, the question was put, whether the clause should be inserted; and it was carried in the negative by 81 voices against 35. The next day, the Loyds read the bill the third time, which, with some amendments, was approved, and sent down to the Commons.

Debate in the Lords about the Conspirators against K. William 3.] June.l. There was a Debate in the House about a Bill, for continuing* the Imprisonment of the conspirators against the life of the late king William. A Petition having been offered in their behalf, the lord North and Grey moved, that a day might be appointed (o consider of it; and was seconded by the lord Trevor. They were opposed by

Lord^Totonshend, f who said, “ He wondered

* R. Blackburn, R. Cassills, J. Bernardi, R. Meldrum, and J. Chambers, were committed to Newgate, in March and April 1696, for conspiring the murder and assassination of king William III. in the 7th and 8th of whose reign and since, several acts were passed forcontinu-ing their imprisonment, from time to time, but all of them expired at the demise of queen Anne. t“ Charles viscount Townshend, who now took the lead in the adminstration, was eldest son of SirHoratioTownshend.who was so highly instrumental in forwarding the restoration of Charles .2, that in 1661 he was created a peer, and , in 1682 raised to the dignity of viscount. Charles

any member of that august assembly, would speak in favour ofsuch execrable wretches, who designed to have embrued their hands in the blood of their sovereign; ” and therefore moved u That their petition be rejected.’* Upon this the

Lord Delaw arrepresented, That after thb

took his seat in the house of peers in 1697, attached himself to Somers, and acted so cordially with the Whigs, that when William formed a new administration, principally composed of that party, a rumour was circulated, that he was appointed privy seal. In 1706, he was nominated one of the commissioners for settling the' union with Scotland; in 1707, captain of the yeomen of the queen’s guard, hnd iu 1709, accompanied the duke of Marlborough to Gertruydenberg, as joint plenipotentiary, to open a negotiation for peace with France; he was deputed in the same year ambassador extraordinary to the states general, and concluded with them the barrier treaty. Soon alter the change of the Whig administration he resigned his embassy, was removed from his post of captain of the yeomen, and censured by the Tory House of \ Commons for having signed that treaty. During the early part of the reign of queen Anne, on account of his youth, he, had acted only a subordinate part; but towards the close of that reign his services and decisive conduct raised his consequence, and he gained great accession of character, with his party, on being prosecuted at the same time with the duke of Marl borough.

“ With parts more solid than specious, Townshend acquired unremitted assiduity, and from long experience, the talent that rendered him an able man of business, which was the principal object of his ambition. Though plain in his language, and often perplexed iu argument, yet he spoke sensibly, and with a thorough knowledge of his subject. He was firm, generous, disinterested, of unblemished integrity, and unsullied honour: but he was warm, impetuous, and impatient of contradiction. Initiated in diplomatic transactions during the congress at Gertruydenberg and the Hague, he cherished too great an attachment to negotiation, and was apt to propose bold and decisive measures, which the temperate and 'pacific disposition of Walpole was continually employed in counteracting.

“ During the two months which immediately preceded the queen’s death, and the interval which ensued between that event and the arrival of the king, Townshend seems to have secured and governed Bothinar, and the other Hanoverian agents in England; to have supplanted Sunderland and Halifax, and to have obtained the entire confidence of the king, of which be had previously acquired a very distinguished share, by his great reputation for integrity and talents, by the recommendation of pensionary Heinsius, Slingelandt and other leading men of the Dutch republic, and by his uniform adherence to the cause of the Protestant suc-cestion.

death of Ling William, the parliament had left to the disccetion of the hue queen either the. continuing in prison, or enlarging of these criminals; That nobody doubted her late majesty's clemency, but that she had such a respect for the memory of king William, such a regard to the safety of crowned heads, and such an abhorrence for the crimes these prisoners stood charged with, that she did not think fit to release them from their confinement: That all these seasons were now enforced, by the open <dis-efibetion shewn to*his majesty’s person and!

Debate in the Commons on the Bill for regu-, lating the Horces.] June 1. The Lords having

sent to the Commons, the bill tor the better regulating the Forces, &c. and the amendments to the bill by the Lords being read, a motion was made, * That the farther consideration of those amendments be adjourned, which was carried in the negative; and then those amendments being read a second time, were agreed to by the House.

Mr. Ship pen, having, on this occasion, reflected on the administration, as if they der signed to set tip a standing army, and insinuated, asif, afterali the great elamour that had been raised, their secret committee would end in smoke; he was taken up by

Mr. Bosoaweny who said, “ He could not forbear taking notice of the insolence of a certain set of men, who having committed the blackest cruses, had yet the assurance to dare the justice of the nation; but he hoped those crimes would not long remain unpunished: That the Committee of Secrecy were ready to

“ An early and intimate connection had been formed between Townshqndand Walpole; they were distantly related, neighbours in.the same county, and educated at the same school; they joined the same party, acted under the same x leaders, underwent the same persecutions, and co-operated in the same opposition. The marriage which Townshead had contracted with Dorothy Walpole, in 17IS, drew closer the bonds-of amity, and added an union of blood to the connection of party. Walpole bad performed too many essential services to the Hanover family, and was too able a speaker in the House of Commons, not to occupy a distinguished situ-> atfon at the accession of George 1, aod his connection with Townshead facilitated his promotion. Soon after the landing of the king, he was, appointed, vas I have already mentioned, paymaster general of the forces, to which was added the paymastership of Chelsea Hospital; very lucrative employments, in which he considerably improved his fortune.’’ Coxe’s Walpole.

Mr. R. Walpole said, “ That he wanted words to express the villainy of the last French*-hed ministry.”

Mr. Secretary Stanhope added, he wendeied, that men who were guilty of sach enormous crimes, had still the audaciousness to appear in the public streets.

Mr. R. Walpole’s Motion receiving the Secret Committee's Report.] June 2. Mr. Rot hert Walpole acquainted the House from the Committee of Secrecy, “ That they had examined the Books, &c. referred to them, and had matters of the greatest importance to lay before the House; and that the committee had directed him to move the House, that a day might be appointed for receiving their Report.” Upon which, alter a small debate, it was ordered, that the said report be received upon that day sevennight; and that all the members do attend at that time, upon pain of incurring the highest displeasure of the House.

JuneS. The king came to the House ef Peers, and gave the royal assent to the Malt-bill and the Mutiny-bill, and his majesty being gone, the Commons returned to their house, and ordered that the Committee of Secrecy should have leave to sit during the adjournment of the House, who then adjourned till the 8th of June, by reason of the Whitsuntide holidays.

Mr. R. Walpole’s Motion jor apprehending such persons as should be named by the Chairman of the Secret Committee.] June 9. Mr. Robert Walpole, from the Committee of Secrecy, acquainted the House; “That he bad a Report to present; according to their order, but that he had thb commands of the Committee to make a motion to the House before he read the Report; That there are in the Report matters of the highest importance: That although the Committee had power to send for persons, papers, and records, they did not think fit to make use thereof, believing it to be necessary, in order to bring offenders to justice, that some persons should be secured, before it is possible they should know what they are to be examined to; and lest they should have notice from what should be read in the report, to make their escape, he was comraalided by the committee, according to former precedents, to move, That a warrant may be issued, by Mr.. Speaker, to apprehend certain persons who shall be named to him by the chairman of the saiil committee; and that no members may be permitted to go out of ^he House.”

Hereupon it was ordered, 1. “ That the lobby be cleared of all strangers, and the back doors of she Speaker’s chamber be focked ap,

and the key brought and laid upon the table; and that the Serjeant do stand at the door of the House, and suffer no member to go forth. 2. That Mr. Speaker do issue his warrant to the serjeant at arms attending the House, to take into his custody such persons as shall be named to Mr. Speaker by the chairman of the Committee of Secrecy, in order to their being examined before the said committee.

Hereupon Mr. Speaker issued out his warrant to the serjeant. at arms, to take into his custody several persons that were named to him 'by Mr. Walpole, particularly Mr. Matthew Prior, and Mr. Thomas Harley, the first of whom was immediately apprehended, and the other some hours after.

The Report from the Secret Committee pretented and read.] This done, Mr.'Walpole acquainted the House *, “ That the Committee of Secrecy had perused the books and papers referred to them, and had agreed upon a report which they had commanded him to make: That it was contained in two books, one of which was the Report, and the other an Appendix to it, containing at large those letters and papers which were referred to in the report.” And he read the Report in his place, and afterwards delivered the same in at the table, together with the Appendix and the books which were referred to the said, committee. The reading of the said report having lasted from one till about six in the evening, amotion was made by the friends of the late ministry, and the question put, That th4 farther consideration thereof be adjourned till next morning1, but it was carried in the negative, by 282 against 175, and ordered, that the Report be now read:And the clerk of the House having read part of it, till half an hour past eight, the farther consideration of it was adjourned.

- Debate thereon.] June 10. The Commons resumed the adjourned consideration of the Report from the Committee of Secrecy, and the rest of the Report being read, which lasted till about four in the afternoon.

Sir Thomas Hanmer *, moved. That the con-

sideration of the said Report be adjourned, till the 21st of the same month, and was seconded by the leading men among the, friends of the late ministry, who moved also, That the said Report f be printed, to be perused by all the members of the House. Hereupon,

Mr. Robert Walpole said, “ He could not but wonder, that those gentlemen who bad shewed so great impatience to have the Report laid before the House, should now press for adjourning the consideration of it. That as for the Committee of Secrecy, as they had not yet gone through all the branches of their in-

quiry, they could have wished some longer time had been allowed them to peruse and digest several important papers. That in order to that they would have deferred thrqe weeks ' or a mqnth, the laying their report before the House; but that some gentlemen having reflected on the pretended slowness of the committee, since the said Report was now before them, they must even go through with it.”

Mr. Secretary Stanhope added, “ That for his own part, he would readily agree to give those gentlemen all the time they could desire to consider of the Report; but that since they themselves bad precipitated this affair, be was of opinion, they ought to prosecute it with vigour, lest, by stopping on a sudden, they should fortify the notion, which the friends of the late ministry had with great industry propagated among the people, that the Report of the Committee of Secrecy would vanish into smoke; the rather, because these malicious insinuations had raised the spirits and insolence of the disaffected, and were the principal cause of the present ferment among the giddy multitude. That he agreed with the member who had moved for the printing of the Report: that dot only the House, but the whole world, might be convinced of the fairness and impartiality of their proceedings; but that the crimes of some persons named in the Report were so obvious to every body, that they ought, in his opinion, immediately proceed to the impeaching of them.”

Some 'proposed the. adjourning the debate till one time, some till another; but the court party were resolved against any delays; and the question being put about seven in the evening, on the motion made by sir Thomas Hanmer, it was carried in the. negative by 280 against 160.

Mr. R. Walpole impeaches Lord Bolingbroke of High Treason.] This point gained:

Mr. Robert Walpole said, “ He made no question, that, after the Report had been twice read, the whole House was fully convinced, that Henry lord viscount Bolingbroke was guilty of High Treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanours:That therefore he im-eached him of those crimes; but if any mem-er had any thing to say in his behalf he doubted not but the House was ready to hear him.”

After a deep silence in the House for some minutes,

Mr. Hungerford rose up and said, u That

in his opinion, nothing was mentioned in the Report, in relation to the lord Bolingbroke, that amounted to High Treason.”

General Ross said, He wondered no body spoke in favour of the lord Bolingbroke: That, for his own part he had nothing to say at present:but reserved to himself to speak in a properer time.

son and other high crimes and misdemeanours, being passed.

Lord Coningsby stood up, and said, “ The

worthy chairman of the Committee has impeached the hand, but I do impeach the head; he has impeached, the clerk, and I the justice; he has impeached the scholar, and I the master:I impeach. Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, of high treason and other high crimes and misdemeanours.” Hereupon,

Mr. Auditor Hurley *made a long pathetic speech j wherein he endeavoured to justify his brother, the earl of Oxford, as having done nothing but by the immediate commands of the late queen; urging, that the peace was a good oue, and approved as such by two parliaments; concluding, that the facts mentioned in the Report, and which were charged on the earl, could not be construed to amount to high treason, but only in strict rigour, to misdemeanours.. He was backed by

Mr. Thomas Foley* the earl’s brother-in-law, who complained of the hardship put upon that nobleman, in charging him with high treason, before they hud examined the Report: but what was yet more favourable for the earl, was spoke by

Sir Joseph Jekylly one of the Committee of Secrecy, who said, That as to the lord Bolingbroke, they had more than sufficient evidence to convict him of high treason, upon the statute 25 Edward 3, but that as to the earl of Oxford, he doubted whether they had either sufficient matter or evidence to impeach him of treason.”

But another member of the Committee of Secrecy having assured the House, That besides what had appeared before them, and was meqtionefl in the Report, - they had other evidence, viva voce:It was resolved, without a division, “ That this'House will impeach Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, of high treason, aDd other high crimes and misdeamean-oursAnd ordered, That it be referred to the Committee of Secrecy, to draw up Articles of Impeachment, and prepare evidence against Henry viscount Bolingbroke, and Robert earl of Oxfordf and earl Mortimer* After this, it was ordered likewise, That the farther consideration of the said Report be adjourned; and that the said Report, with the Appendix, be printed.

June 11. The Commons ordered the Speaker to send a printed copy of the Report from the Committee of Secrecy to the sheriff of every County, and to the returning officer of every city and borough, sending members to parliament.

17.. Mr. Walpole acquainted the.House, That pursuant to their order, Matthew Prior, esq. had been, the day before, examined before thft Committee of Secrecy^ and during a long examination, there appeared matters of such importance, that the Committee had directed him to move the House, that he might be confined in close custody, and no person permitted to come to him: upon'which it was ordered. That Mr. Matthew Prior, * now in custody of the Serjeant at arms, be confined in close custody, and no person permitted to come to him without leave from Mr. Speaker.f

Mr. Secretary Stanhope impeaches James Duke of Ormond of High .] June 21.

The House having, according to order, considered further of the report from the Com>-mittee of Secrecy, ’

Mr. Secretary Stanhope stood up and said. He wished he were not obliged to break silent on that occasion; but that as a member of th? Secret Committee, and of that great assembly which ought to dothe nation justice, he though it his duty, to impeach J^unes duke of Ormond of high treason, and other high, crimes and misdemeanours: He was seconded by Mi; , Boscawen. Hereupon, '

Mr. Archibald Hutcheson made a long speech in behalfof the duke of Ormond, wherein he set forth his noble birth and qualifications; and the great services which -both he and his illustrious ancestors had performed to the crown*and nation; Urged, That in the whole course of his late conduct, he had but obeyed the late queen’s commands; and concluded. That if all that was alledged against his grace in the report could be made out, it would, in the rigour of the law, amount to no more thafc high misdemeanours. This speech made a

great impression on the House; and Mr. Hutcheson was seconded by

General Lutnley, who said among other

things, That the duke of Ormond had, on aii occasions, given signal proofs both of his affection and love for his country, and of his personal bravery and courage, particularly at the battle of Landen, where he was wounded and taken prisoner; and that the late king William was. extremely satisfied with his grace's gallant behaviour. That his grace had generously expended the best part of his estate in the wars, living in a most noble and splendid manner, for uie honour of his country:that therefore £n consideration both of his great services, and his illustrious relations, if he had of late been so unfortunate as to fail in any part of his conduct, they ought not to proceed against him .with the utmost rigour of the law; the rather because he ever meant well, and was drawn into ill measures by crafty ministers.

Sir Joseph Jekytt spoke likewise in favour of jthe duke of Ormond:he said, That if there was room for mercy, be hoped it would be shewn to that noble, generous and courageous pee?, who for m&ny years, had exerted those great accomplishments for the good and honour of/bis country. That if of late he had the mis* fortune to deviate front his forracr'conduct, the blame ought not, in justice and equity, be laid to him, but to them principally, who abusing his affection, loyalty and zeal for the service of his royal mistress, had drawn him into pernicious counsels: that therefore, as the statute of the 25th Edward 3, on which the charge of high treason against his grace was to be grounded, had been mitigated by subsequent laws, the House ought not, in his opinion, to take advantage of that act against the duke, but only impeaeh bim of high crimes and mis-; demeanours. He added, That some persons endeavoured to aggravate the duke ofOrmond’s faults, by charging upon him the riots and tumults which the populace committed daily in many places; but that be durst aver, that his grace did no ways countenance those disorders; and if the ^disaffected made use of his name, unknown to hind) his grace ought not to suffer for it.

General Ross laid great stress upon sir Joseph Jekyll’s opinion, and said all he could in his commendation, and the duke’s defence, i Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Thomas Onslow, Mr: Ward, Mr. Hungerford, and some other members of both parties, spoke also on the aatnfc side: but Mr. Lyddal, member for Lest-wjtkiel, Mr. Hampden; and Mr. Thompson strongly sup ported general Stanhope's motion; hnswered all that had been alledged in the duke’s fevtrnr; and among other things represented, That^he ever affected popularity; that he could not be-ignorant of the tumults and riots of. which his name was the- signal; and that since be did not publicly disown them who made use of his name, his Silence was a tacit approbation of their proceedings, and seemed to summon the people to a general insurrection.

Sir Edward Northey (Attorney General ^, said that he did not disown, but that in the Report of the Committee of Secrecy, there were some matters, on which an impeachment of high treason, might be grounded against the duke of Ormond; but he did not think it proper to explain himself further on that occasion.

Mr. Lechmeret Solicitor General, sp /ke plainer, and mentioned a case parallel to the duke’s, which had been adjudged treason.

This debate lasted from one till about half an hour past ten, when the question was put, and resolved by a majority of 234 voices against 187, to impeach James duke of Ormond of high treason, and other high crimes «nd misdemeanors. After wKich it was ordered, “ That it be referred tb the Committee of Secrecy to draw up Articles of Impeachment, and prepare evidence against James duke of Ormond*;

- “ After these impeachments, that of the duke of Ormond became the principal subject of ^discourse. The high-church party made his name the signal for their tumults, threatening the government and parliament loo, if they proceeded against him. His zeal for the church . was their chief topic to excite- the mobs to appear for him; and his noble birth, and the services of his ancestors, and of himself ih Flanders, during king William’s reign, were insisted upon. Nor was his generosity, or rather profuse way of living, omitted, to prepossess the people in his favour:' but all signified nothing; fob though the king at his first arrival, shewed more lenity and respect to him, than his conduct deserved, and seemed willing to pass by his miscarriages, while general, as far as possible, the behaviour of the duke and his friends was such, as made it impracticable; for instead of discouraging the mobs, who were taught to cry out, an Ormond, in opposition to king George, he plainly countenanced them, and took a great' deal of pride to be the idol of the rabtle.; He affected to have people of quality appear at his levee, and frequent his house; and, instead of behaving himself submissively, had the vanity to justify his conduct in a printed piece, which in reality exposed him more to censure. About the middle of June, the following advertisement was dispersed wqh great industry:On Tues- "

* day, the 7th, of this month, her grace the ‘duchess of Ormond, in her return from Rich-

* mond, was stopped in her coach, by three per-‘ sons, well mounted, and well armed, in dis-‘ guise, who inquired if the duke was in the

* coach, and seemed to have a design upon his ‘ life, if be iiad been there. It has been ob-‘ served; that many persons, armed and dis-

* guised in like manner, have been watching by

* day and by night upon that road, on each side ‘ of the water, and it is not to be doubted, with

* a design to assassinate him.’ This being evidently calculated to excite the fury of the populace agfiinst the duke’s supposed enemies, the rest of his conduct could not but darm the government, and perhaps provoked the House of Commons to proceed against him sooner,

and that the farther consideration of the said Report be adjourned to the next morning.”

Mr. Aislabg impeaches Thomas Earl of

Strafford of high Crimes and .]

June 22. The Commons resumed the consideration of the Report from the Committee of Secrecy, and

Mr. Aislabijy who spoke first, took notice of the general concern that had appeared the day before in the House, for the noble person that was impeached; because they were persuaded, it was rather through weakness than malice that he had followed pernicious counsels; but that, in his opinion, few if any, would speak in favour of another lord, whom he was to impeach. That the person he meant, was Thomas earl of Strafford, one of the plenipotentiaries of Great Britain at the congress of Utrecht; whose conduct had been vastly different from that of his colleague, the lord bishop of London (Dr. John Robinson.) That this good and pious prelate seemed to have been put at the bead of that negociation, only to palliate the iniquity of it, under the sacredness of his character; but was little mpre than a cypher in the absence of the earl of Strafford. That the bishop not being in the secret had acted with reserve and caution, and would do nothing without the queen’s special commands; whereas the earl of Strafford not only was forward to ▼enture and undertake any thing, as he expresses himself in one of his letters, to be the tool of a Frenchified ministry; but in many in- stances had gone beyond his instructions, and advised the most pernicious measures. That having impartially weighed the different conduct of these two ministers, 1 he was glad that nothing could be charged upon the bishop, since it gave them an opportunity to convince the world that the church is not in danger: but moved, That Thomas earl of Strafford be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanours. Mr. A is la by afterwards enlarged upon this charge, which he reduced to these three principal heads, viz. 1. The earl of Strafford’s advising the fatal suspension of arms, which was soon after attended with several misfortunes that befel the allies; and at last reduced them to the necessity of

and with more vigour, than they would otherwise have done. It was the general opinion, that the rash, unadvised behaviour of the duke’s, pretended friends, of whom bishop Atterbury was chief, greatly promoted this vote* It was said upon very good grounds, that a relation of the duke’s had prevailed upon him at that time to write a submissive letter to the king, desiring a favourable interpretation of his former actions, and imploring his majesty's clemency:which had so good an effect, that he was to have been privately admitted to the king in his closet, to confirm what he had written. But, before the time came, bishop Atterbury had been with him, and the congruence was, that be left England abruptly, and never returned to it more.” Tindal.

submitting to the terms of an unsafe, dishonourable peace. 2. Advising the seizing of Ghent and Bruges, in order to distress the allies, and favour the enemy. 3. The insolence and contempt with which he bad treated the most serene House of Hanover, and their generals and ministers.

Mr. Bailie, having seconded Mr. Aislaby,

Sir WilliamWyndham endeavoured to justify the earl of Strafford, as to the first head, by saying, Thatthe peace, which was but the sequel and necessary consequence of the suspension of arms, haa been approved as such by two successive parliaments, and declared advantageous, safe, and honourable. Mr. Shipped, Mr. Ward, and Mr. Snell, member for Gloucester, spoke also in favour of the carl of Strafford; as did also

Mr . Hungetfordjwho among other things,

said, that though the bishop of London had an equal share with the earl of Strafford in the ne» gociation of peace, he. was, it seems, to have the benefit of his clergy. General Ross having likewise said something to excuse the suspension of arms:

General Cadogan answered, that considering the situation of both armies, the confederates lost the fairest opportunity they ever had in Flanders, to destroy the enemy's army, and to penetrate into the very heart of France; but adped, that nothing less could be expected from a princess and a ministry, who had entirely delivered themselves into the hands of France.

Sir JamesCampbel spoke also against the

earl of Strafford.

Sir David Dalrymple summed up what had been said on both sides; and having illustrated the present case by parallel instances and proper observations, urged, that both by the civil and statute laws, the earl of Stratford was, at least, guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors.

Hereupon, about seven in the evening, the question was put, and by 208 voices against 100, it was resolv’d, “ That the House will impeach Thomas, earl of Strafford, of high crimes and misdemeanors; ” and ordered, That it be referred to the Committee of Secrecy, to draw up Articles of Impeachment and prepare evidence against the said earl.

Mr. Walpole from the Committee of Secrecy reports the Articles against the Earl Oxjord.] July 7. Mr. Robert Walpole, from the Com-tniitee of Secrecy, acquainted the House, “Thai the committee having prepared articles of impeachment of high treason and other high crimes hnd misdemeanors, against Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, had commanded him to acquaint the House, that they should, in a short time, have farther articles agaiest'the said earl; and that the committee had directed him to report the articles, already prepared, to the HouseAnd he read them in his place, and afterwards delivered them in at the table, where they were once read.

After this it was moved, that the farther co» *

aideration of the said articles be adjourned to that day sennight; bat it was' carried, without dividing, that the said report be read a second time the next day. At which time the first ten articles of impeachment against Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, were read a second time; and upon the question severally put thereupon, with amendments.to some of them, there was a long debate from two. till eight in the evening, when they were agreed to, by 280 against 125. Then a motion being made and the question put, That the farther consideration •of the said Report be adjourned till the next morning, the same was carried in the negative, by 247 against 139.

Hereupon the eleventh article was read a second time, and amended by the House; and then there arose a great debate, upon the question, Whether the scud article was high treason ? Sir Robert Raymond, Mr. Bromley, sir William Wyndham, Mr. Edward Harley, Mr. Thomas Foley, Mr. Ward and Mr. Hungerford main-mined the negative; and were strongly supported by

Sir Joseph Jekyll, one of the Committee of

Bebrecy, who said, “ That it was ever his principle to do justice to’every body, from the highest to the lowest; being persuaded, that it was the duty of an honest man never to act by » spirit of party. That he hoped he might pretend to have some knowledge of the laws of the kingdom; and as in the committee of secrecy, hf had taken the liberty to differ from his colleagues, he would not scruple to declare now to the whole House, that, in his judgment, the charge in question did not amount to high treason.” Most of the other members of the Committee of Secrecy were oifended at this speech, and thereupon

Mr. Robert Walpole answered, That there were both in and out of the Committee of Secrecy, several persons who did not, in the least, yield to the member that spoke last, in point of honesty; and who, without derogating from his merit, were superior to him in the knowledge of the laws; bat who at the same time, were satisfied that the charge specified in the eleventh article amounted to treason.

Mr. Walpole was backed by general Stanhope, the lord Coningsby, general Cadogan, Mr. Boscawen, and Mr. Aislaby; and the eleventh article being amended, the same was agreed to by the House, by 247 votes against 127.

Mr. Auditor Harley endeavoured tojustify the earl of Oxford, 1. By urging that he ever acted by the late queen’s positive commands; to prove which he offered to produce two letters from her majesty; and 2. The necessity of making a peace; he having upon this occasion, advanced, that the Dutch prolonged the war, and that their deputies in the army had often prevented the giving the enemy a decisive blow.

General Cadogan answered, that the Dutch were more concerned than any prince or state in the grand alliance to put an end to the war; *bd Undertook to prove, that there had not

been any campaign in Flanders, except that in which the duke of Ormond commanded, that was not marked and famous to all posterity for some signal and glorious event, te the advantage of the common cause ?

The said Articles agreed to; and ordered to be carried to the Lords.]Then the rest of the sixteen

articles were severally read a second time, and with amendments to some of them, agreed onto by the House, who ordered, “ That the said articles be engrossed; and, that a clause be prepared, saving liberty to the Commons to exhibit any farther Articles against the said Robert, earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer; and that he may be sequestered from parliament, and committed to safe custody

July 9. The above clause was offered to the Hoase; and being twice read and agreed to, was ordered to be engrossed with the Articles of Impeachment. The same day the ingrossed Articles of Impeachment against Robert, earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, were read; after which, it was ordered, 1. That the Lord Coningsby do carry the said Articles to the Lords: 2. That his lordship be directed, before he exhibit the said Articles to the Lords, to impeach Robert earl of Oxford and Mortimer, to the effect following, viz.

“ My Lords; 1

“ The Commons assembled in parliament having received information of divers traiterous practices and designs of a great peer of this House, Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer; have commanded pae to impeach the said earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, of high treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanours:And I do here in their names, and in the names of all the Commons of Great Britain, impeach Robert, earl of Oxford and ea^l Mortimer of high treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. Iam farther commanded by the House of Commons to pray and demand of your lordships, that the earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer may be sequestered from parliament, and forthwith committed to safe custody

The Articles of Impeachment acains I the Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer.} After this, the lord Coningsby, attended by most of those members who voted for (he impeachment, went up to the House of Peers, and at their bar impeached Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, in the form above mentioned; and then left with their lordships the Articles of Impeachment against the said earl, which were read as follows:

ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT of High Treason, and other High Crimes and Misdemeanors, against ROBERT Earl of OXFORD and Earl MORTIMER.

sod from the considerations of the common danger which threatened all Christendom from the; immoderate growth of the poorer of France: and whereas the preventing the monarchy of Spain from coming into the hands of the House of Bourbon has for many years been a fundamental principle and maxim of union among the Allies in order to preserve a just balance of power in Europe; and, to that - end, as the designs of France on the monarchy of Spain have from time to time appeared, new treaties and express stipulations have been entered into amongst the Allies, ; to strengthen themselves against that approaching danger; and, on this foundation, a treaty for an intended partition, whereby a small part only of the dominions of the crown of Spain was allotted to the iiouse of Bourbon, was condemned by the wisdom of Parliament, as being highly prejudicial and fatal in its consequences to England, and the peace of Europe; and whereas the duke of Anjou, grandson to the king of France, on the demise of Charles the 2nd, king of Spain, took possession of the entire monarchy of Spain, whereby the balance of power, the Protestant Religion and the liberties of Europe, were threatened with immediate danger; whereupon Leopold then emperor of Germany, his late majesty king William the third of ever-glorious memory, and the States General of the United Provinces, finding, at that most critical juncture, that a strict conjunction and alliance between themselves was become necessary, for repelling the greatness of the tommoft danger from so great an accession of power to the then common enemy, did, in the year of our Lord, 1701, make form and conclude, a new treaty and alliance, whereby it was agreed, u That there shall be and continue between the said confederates, his sacred imperial majesty, his sacred royal majesty of Great Britain, and the lords the States General of the United Provinces, a constant, perpetual, *antl inviolable friendship and correspondence; and that each party shall be obliged to promote the advantages of the other and prevent all inconveniencies and dangers that might happen to them, as far as lies in their power: that the said Allies desiring nothing more earnestly than the peace and general quiet of all Europe, have adjudged, that nothing can be more effectual for the establishment thereof^ than the procuring an equitable and reasonable satisfaction to his imperial majesty, for his pretension to the-Spanish succession; and that the king of Great Britain and the States General may obtain a particular and sufficient security for their kingdoms, provinces and dominions, and for the navigation and commerce of their subjects; that the said confederates therefore shall, in the first place, endeavour. by amicable means to obtain the said satisfaction; but if, contrary to their expectation and wishes, the same is not had, the said confederates do engage and promise to one another, that they will assist each other with, all their forces, according to a specification to be agreed upon in a peculiar convention for that

purpose:that the confederates, in order to the procuring the satisfaction and security aforesaid, shall, amongst other things, use their utmost endeavours to recovfer the provinces of the Spanish Low Countries, that they may be a fence and rampart, commonly called a Barrier, separating and dividing France frjnj the United Provinces, for the security of the States General as they have served in all times, till of late that* the most Christian king has seized.them by his forces; as likewise the duchy of Milan, with its deperidances, as a, fief of the empire, and contributing to the security of his imperial majesty’s hereditary dominions:besides the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, and the lands and Islands upon the coast of Tuscany in the Mediterranean, that belonged to the Spanish dominions, and may serve to the same purpose, and will be also of advantage to the navigation and commerce of the subjects of the king of Great Britain and of the United Provinces r that, in case the confederates shall be forced to enter into a war, for obtaining the satisfaction aforesaid for his imperial majesty, and the security of his majesty of Great Britain and the .States General, they shall faithfully conimunh-cate tlleir designs to one another, as .well in relation to the; actions of. the war, as all other things wherein the common cause is concerned): that it shall not bq permitted to either party, when the war is once begun, to treat of peace with the enemy, unless jointly and by a communication of counsels; and no peace shall be made unless an equitable and reasonable satisfaction for his imperial majesty, and the particular security of the kingdoms, provinces, dominions, navigations, and commerce, for his majesty of Great Britain and the States General be first obtained; and unless care be taken, by fitting security, that the kingdoms of France and Spain shall never come and be united under the same government, nor that one and the same person shall be king of both kingdoms, and particularly, that the French shall never get into the possession of the Spanish Indies; neither shall they be permitted to sail thither, on the account of traffic directly, or any pretence whatsoever; and lastly, unless full liberty be granted unto the subjects of the king of Great Britain and the States General, to exercise and enjoy all the same privileges, rights, immunities and franchises of commerce, by sea and land, in Spain^ the Mediterranean, and all lands and places which the king of Spain last deceased did possess at the time of his death, a$ well in Europe as elsewhere, which they used and enjoyed or which the subjects of both or either of them by any right, acquired by treaties, agreements, customs, or any other way whatsoever, might have used and enjoyed before the death of the late king of Spam that, at the same time, that the said agreement or peace shall be made, the confederates shall agree amongst themselves about all the things.that they shall think necessary, for maintaining the navigation and commerce of the subjects of his majesty of Great Britain and the States General, in the

lands and dominions they may acquire, and that were possessed by the late deceased king of Spain; and also in what manner the States General may be secured by the aforesaid Fence or Barrier.” And whereas his said late ma* jesty king William and the States General, se? riousiy .considering that France, was then become so formidable, from the accession of Spain to the duke of Anjou, thatj in the opinion of all the world, Europe was in danger of losing her liberty and undergoing the heavy yoke of unU vcrsal monarchy; and that the surest means of effecting that design were, to divide the king of Great Britain from the States General, for which purpose all imaginable efforts would be made:they therefore thought it necessary to unite in the strictest manner that was possible; and, to that end, a defensive treaty and alliance was concluded and entered into between them, in or about the month, of November 170t, where- in it was, among other things, agreed, “ That, in case the said High Allies should be jointly engaged in war, by reason of this defensive alliance before mentioned in the fifth article, or on any other account, there shall be an offensive and defensive and perpetual alliance between them, against those with whom the war shall be, and all their forces shall be employed by sea and land, and they shall act in conjunction or separately, as it shall be agreed between them that, since, in the alliance with the- emperor, made in September last, particular care was taken of the recovery of the Spanish Low Countries out of the hands of the most Christian king, the said confederates expressly engpge to aid one another with all their forces, for the recovery of the same; and in regard the principal interest of the said confederates consists in the preservation of the liberties of Europe, the before-mentioned treaty, with the emperor shall be faithfully and sincerely executed, and both sides shall guaranty the same, and use their endeavours to confirm and render it more strong from time to time:that, in making peace, particular care shall be taken of the commence and tralfic of both nations; as also fjt their security, as well ih regard to the Low Countries, as the eountries adjacent': that when the war i9 begfrn, the confederates shall act in concert, according to the seventh and eighth articles of the treaty bf the 3d of March in the year of our Lord 1677 — 8, between England and Holland, which is hereby renewed and confirmed; and no peace nor truce, or suspension of arms, shall be negotiated or made, but according to the ninth and tenth articles of that treaty; by which it was agreed, “ that, when the two allies come once to an open warj it shall be lawful for neither of them afterwards to come to any cessation of arms with him who shall be declared and proclaimed an enemy, without it be done-conjointly and with common consentthat no negotiation of peace shall be set on foot by one of the allies without the' concurrence of the other: that each ally shall continually, and from time to time, impart to the other every thing tjiat passes in

the said negotiation; and. shall stipulate with the common enemy for the same rights, immu-nities, exceptions, and prerogatives, for his ally, as he does for himself, if so be the said allies do not agree to the contrary.” And whereas tho French king, having got possession of a great part of the ^Spanish Dominions, exercised an absolute authority over that monarchy, having seized Milan and the Spanish Low Countries by his armiesr and made himself master of Cadiz, of the (entrance into the Mediterranean, And of the ports of the Spanish" West Indies, by hit fleets, every where designing to invttde the li* berties of Europe, and to obstruct the freedom of navigation and commerce; and, instead of giving the satisfaction that ought justly to bt expected, had proceeded to further violences and had taken on him to declare the pretended prince of Wales, king of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and hud also influenced Spain to concur in the same affront; her late majesty queen Anne, taking notice, “ That she found herself obliged, for maintaining the public faith, for vindicating the honour of the crown, and to prevent the mischiefj which all Europe was threatened with, to declare war against France and Spain, ” did accordingly, in the month of May 1702, in the most public and solemn' manner declare war against France and Spain; and, in the said declaration, placing her entire' confidence in the help of Almighty God; in so just and necessary an undertaking, declared, “ That she would, in Conjunction with her allies, vigorously prosecute the same, both by sea and jand; being assured of the ready concurrence of her subjects, in a cause they had so openly and heartily espoused And his imperial majesty and their high mightinesses, pursuant to the treaties aforementioned, respectively, in or about the said month of May 1702, did likewise declare war against France and Spain:And whereas the kings of Portugal and Prussia, the electors of Hanover, Saxony, Treves, Mentz, Palatine of the Rhine, the duke of Savoy> the prince of Hesse, the dukes, of Wolfembcittle, Mechienburg, and Wirtem-burg, the circles of Suabia and Franconia, and of the Upper Rhine, the bishops of Munster and Constance, and other princes and powers, being invited by the said grand alliance, and relying on the faith thereof, did afterwards become parties to the said confederate war against France and Spain; and, in- the treaty entered into in or about the month of May 1703, between his imperial majesty, thfe queen of Great Britain, the States General, and the king of Portugal, it is, amongst other tilings, expressly stipulated, u That no peace nor truce shall be made, but by the mutual Consent of all the confederates; nor shall any ak any time be made, .whilst the second grandson of the most Christian king, by the Dauphin, of any other prince of the line of France, continues in Spain; nor unless the crown of Portugal shall fully possess and efljoy all ‘the lands, kingdoms, isles, castles, cities, towns, &c. with their territories and dependants, in

Spain or elsewhere, {which it now posses* ses;" and in the treaty ofNorlingen, ratified by her late majesty, it is, amongst other things, expressly agreed “ that it shall not be allowed to make particular treaties; but the peace shall be jointly treated of, and shall not be concluded, without obtaining, as for as is possible, the reunion of the lands belonging to the circles, and until, at least, the security of the associated circles be absolutely provided for in the best manner that is possible, and better than it has formerly been/' And whereas to give the greatest strength that was possible to the union so necessary to both nations, her late majesty and the States, by a treaty in the month of June 1701, renewed and confirmed all treaties and alliances then subsisting between them; and therein it is amongst other things, expressly and particularly stipulated, “ That, as the said most serene queen and the lords the States General are now in war with France and Spain, and are reciprocally bound to assist each other, and mutually to defend, maintain, and preserve their countries and subjects, io their possessions, immunities, and liberties, as well of navigation and commerce, as other rights whatsoever by sea and land, against, and in opposition to, all kings, princes, and states, and particularly against France and Spain, to the end a just and reasonable peace may the better be obtained, and may establish the repose and tranquillity of Europe; it is agreed, between the most serene queen of Great Britain and 'the said lords the States General, that neither of the said allies shall make a suspension of arms, or a peace, with France or Spain, or any other king, prince, or state, who shall molest or attack either of the said allies, but in conjunction, and by common consent." And whereas the said war was, for several years, carried on with vigour and unanimity, by her majesty and her allies, at a vast expense both of blood and treasure; for the support of which, on the part of England, many millions have been granted by parliament; who on many occasions since, continued not only to express their sense of the justice and necessity of the war, but did frequently give their humble advice to the throne, “ That no.peace could be safe, honourable or lasting, so long as the kingdom of Spain and the West Indies continued in the possession of any branch of the house of Bourbon And whereas it pleased Almighty God to grant to the confederate arms, under the command of their great and victorious general the duke of Marlborough, such unparalleled ' successes as exceeded even their own hopes and the fears of the enemy; and by the many signal victories of Sthellenberg, Hochstedt, Audeuarde, and Ramellies, as well as the conquests of the Electorates of Bavaria and Cologne, and the reduction of the Spanish ' Netherlands, and many other great advantages both by sea and land, and by the wisdom and unanimity of their- councils, the glory of the confederate arms, and the reputation of Great-Britain iu particular, was raised to an higher

Eitcfa than in tiny former age t And whereas er late majesty in conjunction with her allies, wisely foreseeing, that, whenever the enemy should be brought to make overtures of peace, the surest way to put an end to the war, and prevent France from putting in practice her usual intrigues, was, by previously insisting on such conditions from* France, that nothing might remain to be done in a general assembly, but to give thego the form of a treaty, and, for those reasons, a preliminary treaty was concluded on, and was afterwards signed by the Plenipotentiaries of his imperial majesty, of her late majesty the queen of Great Britain, and of the lords of the States General of the United Provinces, and afterwards ratified by their principals, wherein the interests of the several allies were adjusted, in order to a general treaty of peace with France; and therein the restitution of the Spanish monarchy to the house of Austria, being one of the chief causes for carrying on the war, is laid down as an immutable foundation among the allies: and whereas in the year of our Lord 1709, the king of France, having first signified his consent to the restitution of the Spanish monarchy to the house of Austria, sent his ministers to the Hague, to treat with the ministers of the principal allies on a general peace; and in the conferences held thereupon, the interests of all the allies, as adjusted in the said preliminaries, were positively and expressly agreed to by the ministers of France, and particularly that of the restitution of the entire Spanish monarchy to the 'house of Austria; and the said negociation was afterwards broke on no other dispute but on the 37th article of the preliminary treaty, concerning the time and manner of evacuating Spain: and whereas, the conferences being resumed at Gertruydenberg, in the year of our Lord 1710, the said 371 h article became the only si\bject of the negociation which was there set on foot, for the finding out some equivalent, by which the same security might be given to the allies as they had by the 37th article of the said, preliminaries; and though it was unques* tionable, that before any negociation was begun, that while the preliminaries were treating, that by those preliminaries themselves, that before the last negociation was resumed, and all the while it lasted, the restitution of Spain and the Indies was laid down as a firm and immoveable foundation of the negociation, find no question remained concerning it, with the ministers of the allies, or those of France, but touching the security for its execution; and though all reasonable and prudent overtures were made by the allies, for settling an -equivalent; yet the conferences were broke off by France, without any satisfaction therein:and whereas the sincere intentions of all the allies* to have settled the peace of Europe on solid and equitable foundations, were notorious and incontestable, and the rupture of the said negotiations could only be imputed to the enemy; her sacred majesty, in conjunction with her allies, renewed their resolutions to continue

and push the war with vigour, and to make all possible efforts, as the only means left to force a good and general peace: and her majesty, in her speech from the throne, on the fifteenth of November 1709, taking notice of the endeavours of the enemy, during the said negociations, to amuse and create jealousies among the allies, declared her resentment thereat, and earnestly recommended “ the carrying on the war, and a vigorous prosecution of the advantages obtained, that she might put the last hand to that great work, of reducing the exorbitant and oppressive power, which had so long threatened the liberties of Europe.” And it having pleased Almighty God after the said preliminary treaty, to bless the confederate army, under the command of their consummate general the duke of Marlborough, with new and signal conquests, the reduction of Tournay, the victory of Tasnieres, the taking ofMons and Doway, Bethune, St. Venant, and Aire, and the penetrating the lines near the Scarpe:and whereas, from the prosperous condition of the affairs of the allies^ and the wisdom, firmness, and unanimity of their councils, nothing remained, in all human> appearance, but that they should reap the fruits of all their victories, in a speedy, just, honourable, and lasting peace; and, on the other hand, nothing was left to raise the hopes of the enemy, whereby to defeat that happy prospect, but the success of their secret endeavours to disunite the confederacy:and whereas, Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, with other evil minded persons, enemies to the true interests of their own country, as well as to the common liberties and welfare of Europe, having by many wicked arts and base insinuations, obtained access to her late majesty queen Anne; and in or about the months of July or August 1710, being admitted into her councils^ ari¥ into places of the highest trust; and to make way for their wicked enterprizes, did by their evil counsel and advice, prevail on her majesty to dissolve a parliament, which hyd given the most unquestionable proofs of their great wisdom, and of their true veal for the common cause; for which as well for the many marks of duty and affection given to her, her majesty returned her hearty thanks, and expressed her great satisfaction: and

whereas the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, and others his accomplices, had formed a treacherous correspondence with the emissaries of France, by means whereof, certain propositions were transmitted from France to England, signed by Monsieur de Torcy secretary of the king of France, in the month of April~ 1711, to be the basis of a treaty of a general peace; which propositions, though her, majesty was prevailed on, by the false counsels •f the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer and others, to receive as a sufficient foundation for a treaty, of a general peace, and as such to communicate them to the grand pensionary and the ministers of Holland; her ma-, jesty however was graciously pleased, at the name time to declare 19them her pleasure, by

her secretary of state, “That, being resolved, in making peace as in making war, to act in perfect concert with the States, she would not lose a moment in transmitting a paper of that importance; and that though the propositions were general, and contained an . air of complaisauce to her majesty, and the contrary towards the States; yet that could have no ill consequences, as long as her majes» ty and the States understood one another, and, acted with as little reserve as became two powers so nearly allied in interest; and that the Pensionary should be assured, that that rule should be inviolably kept on her part.” Which gracious declaration of her majesty, as well as the said propositions, being matOrely considered by the grand Pensionary and th» ministers of Holland; an answer was returned from them to her majesty, full of duty and thankfulness for the obliging manner in which she was pleased to communicate the said propositions; and with the utmost assurances of mutual confidence, so necessary to prevent the designs of the enemy; but more particularly, that the States desired equally with Great Britain, to have a general, definitive, and lasting peace; and declared, “ That they were ready to join in all the most proper measures to procure it; that the propositions were yet too general; and that the States desire, as Great Britain did, that France would explain herself more particularly upon the points therein contained, and impart a plan which she thinks the most proper to secure the interest of the allies, and settle the repose of Europe; after which, a more particular negociation might be entered into.” Notwithstanding all which premises,

of England, and by the said Sieur Mesnager on the part of France, was, by the evil advice and contrivance of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and ear) Mortimer, and others, wilfully and industriously concealed, not only from all the allies, but even from her majesty’s council and her parliament: And he did further advise her majesty, not only to accept the said general preliminaries; but in her name, and by her authority, to communicate the same to the States General, as a sufficient foundation whereon to open the conferences of peace with France: And, the more effectually to cover from the States General the pernicious steps which his evil influence had engaged her majesty in with the common enemy, certain instructions were prepared, and, by his counsel and advice, were signed by her majesty, and delivered to the earl of Strafford, her ambassador to the States General; iwherein the said earl of Strafford is directed to represent to the Pensionary of Holland, and to auch others as shall be appointed to confer with him, u That when Jier majesty had received, in

May last, by his excellency’s dispatches, an account of the sense which those among them who were at that time in the secret had of the overtures made by France for setting a general negotiation of peace again on foot, and of the answer which it was desired might be returned to the propositions signed by Monsieur de Torcy, her majesty did 'immediately acquaint the enemy, “ That their offers were thought by her and by the States General neither particular nor full enough; and therefore that her majesty did insist, that they should form a distinct project of such a peace as they were willing to conclude Whereas no such instances had been made to the enemy on her majesty’s behalf; but, on the contrary, notwithstanding her majesty had declared, “ That the propositions of Monsieur de Torcy were thought by her and the StatesQeneral neither particular nor full enough ; ”yet, without any further explication from the enemy, her Majesty was prevailed on, in manner aforesaid, .to send over propositions to France, as general and ensnaring, and in all respects as destructive to the interests of Great Britain and her allies, as the propositions of Monsieur de Torcy; and the said general preliminaries, communicated to the States in manner aforesaid, were calculated only to amuse and deceive them into a general negotiation with France; and in the particulars abovesaid, as well as in several others the said instructions contained matters either false or grossly prevaricating and evasive: By which most wicked counsels of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, that unquestionable truth and sacredness, which, by the laws of nations, ought to accompany and constitute the instructions of public ambassadors to princes in friendship and confederacy against the common'enemy, was most vilely prostituted to the most dangerous purposes, to deceive and mislead her majesty’s good allies in matters of the greatest importance to their own interests; and the interests of these kingdoms, the honour of her majesty’s sacred person, and of the im-

perial crown of these realms, which had been raised to the highest pitch Qf glory abroad, and had been justly held in veneration with her good allies, was scandalously debased and betrayed; and the royal hand, by the wicked arts of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, was made the instrument to advance the interest of the common enemy.

Article IV.

w That whereas the earl of Strafford, pursuant to his said instructions, had communicated the preliminaries, signed by M. Mesnager only, to the States General; who, heipgjustly alarmed at the pressing instances made on the part of her majesty, that conferences should be opened on propositions as general and uncertain as to those so lately offered by France and signed by M. de Torcy, and their High Mightinesses having been unsuccessful in their remonstrances to the earl of Strafford against opening the conferences upon the said propositions, did send over M. Buys, their ambassador, to represent to her majesty, as well the hazard of meeting

* the ministers of France before the essential

* articles were first settled by special prelimina-

* ries, or at least explained by France, and made ‘ specific; as likewise the advantages to the

* enemy, who, being but one body, were influ-‘ enced by one council, and directed by one ‘power; whereas the confederates consisted of ‘ several powers, w hose interests are not only ‘ distinct, but in many cases, contrary to eacii

* opportunity to divide the allies, when it would ‘ be impossible for them to break in upon

* France; ’ and further to represent, ‘ that the propositions themselves were in some instances ‘ very prejudicial; and particularly in the ar-‘ ticlps of commerce, Dunkirk, god the Union of

* the crowns of France and Spain all which representations of the said Mr. Buys, by the evil influence of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer and others, were rendered ineffectual. But in order to prevail upon the States General to open the conferences upon the said general preliminaries, by the management and contrivance of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer and others, an occasion was taken to declare to Mr. Buys, qt a committee of council, in her majesty’s name, ‘ Her constant affection and good ‘ disposition to their State, and to the pro *

‘ moting their interest, and to treat with their

* High Mightinesses with a perfect confidence

* and harmony; ’ and at the same time, he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer did then falsely and maliciously deolare, or was privy to advising and consenting that it should be and so it was declared, in her majesty’s name, ‘ That she had made no separate treaty ‘with Frances nor would ever make any, be-‘ fore she had fully complied with all engage-

basely entered into a confederacy and collusion even with the ministers of the enemy, and prevailed on her majesty to give her royal consent thereto, the more effectually to impose on his imperial majesty and all the allies, and to conceal the said secret negotiations, and the se- ' parate treaty that had been agreed on between Great Britain and France. And the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, not only in the particulars before mentioned, but in many others contained in the said instructions, has brought a lasting reproach on the crown of these realms, and grossly violated the many treaties wherein her sacred majesty was then engaged to her allies, to act in perfect concert with them throughout the negotiations of peace.

Article VI.

Article VII.

u That her sacred majesty queen Anne having been prevailed on, by the false counsels of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, to accept of a treaty with France, on the supposition that the Spanish monarchy should continue in the possession of a branch of the house of Bourbon; and it being acknowledged, even by the French king, in the general preliminaries signed by Monsieur Mesnager, “ That the excess of power, from the re-union of the crowns of France and Spain, would be contrary to the good and general repose of Europe; ” he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, having nothing so much in view as the aggrandizing the common enemy, et always intending to cover the iniquity of is heart under specious pretences and false appearances, did wickedly and treacherously advise and carry on a private and separate negotiation with France, on the subject of a renunciation of his right to the kingdom of France bjr the duke of Anjou, and that such renunciation should be the security against the re-union of the two kingdoms; and, by the influence of his evil counsels, her majesty was prevailed on to accept, and finally to conclude and ratify, a treaty of peace with France, wherein the said renunciation is taken as a sufficient expedient to prevent the mischiefs that threatened all Europe, in case the crowns of France, and Spain should be united upon the head of one and the same p#rson; although he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer well kuew that a memorial had been, during th6 said separate negotiation, transmitted, by Monsieur de, Torcy, secretary of state and minister to the French king, to one of her majesty’s principal secretaries of state, whereby it was declared, That the said renunciation would be null and invalid, by the fundamental laws of France; which laws were looked upon as the work of him who had established all monarchies, and which he only could abolish; and, that no renunciation therefore could destroy it; and, if the king of Spain should renounce, they would deceive themselves that should receive it as a sufficient expedient to prevent the mischiefs proposed to be avoided.” By which false and treacherous counsels, he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer did not only betray the interest of the common cause into the hand of the most formidable enemy; but wilfully, and maliciously abused the power and influence which he had obtained, with her majesty, so far as to engage her sacred majesty, and the honour ef the imperial crown of these kingdoms, to become party with France in so fatal a deceit.

/ Article VIII.

u That her late majesty queen Anne having on the 7th day of December in the year of our lord 1711, earnestly recommended it from the throne, “ That provision might be made for an •orly campaign, in order to carry on the war

Which representations the bishop of Bristol did, at the instance of the allies, signify to one of her majesty’s principal secretaries of state. But their High Mightinesses, finding that all applications to the ministers of Great Britain, and in particular to the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, were of no avajl against France, and for the interest of the common cause, thought it necessary. In a manner the most moying and respectful, to address directly to her majesty by a letter of the 5th of June 1712; therein expressing “ their great surprise and affliction at the two declarations aforementioned: and finding it difficult to conceive fiow such declarations, so prejudicial to the common cause, given so suddenly, without their knowledge, and undoubtedly too without the knowledge of the other allies, could agree and consist with the nature of an alliance, and with those assurances and engagements her majesty bad so lately made; and not knowing how to reconcile it with the great goodness and kindness Which her majesty had always honoured them with; and not being able to conceive how such a sudden change could happen with respect to them, having carefully examined their own conduct, and finding nothing therein that coaid have given ground to her majesty’s dissatisfactionand, having represented the visible and immediate fatal consequences of the said two orders, not only to the common interest of her majesty and the States, but to the whole confederacy and to the Protestant religion, they beseeched her majesty, with all

v the respect and all the earnestness they were Capable of, ‘ That she would not persist in the

* declarations made by the bishop of Bristol:

* and would he pleased to revoke the orders

* given to the dqke of Ormond, and would au-r thorise him to act according to occurrences,

* and as the exigency of the war and the ad-

* vancement of the common cause should re-i quire iNotwithstanding which, he the said Robert earl of Oxford ana earl Mortimer, being acquainted with the said representations of the States, was not only wanting in his duty to her {najesjty and to his oath, and the great trust reposed in him, in not advising, as he ought to have done, her sacred majesty tp have hearkened to the said several instances made to her; but, persisting in his desperate and destructive ipeasures^pr the advancement of the interest

of the common enemy, did afterwards advise her majesty to disregard and reject the same; and did countenance, encourage, advise, and promote, the said private, separate, and wicked negotiations with France, without any participation of the allies, contrary to all her majesty’s engagements, and to the apparent ruin of the common cause: By which several wicked and perfidious counsels, the progress of the victorious arms of the confederates were stopped, and an opportunity lost for conquering the enemy, the most favourable, in the opinion of all the general officers and the quarter-masters of the allies, who were sent out to view the French camp; and whereby all hopes of confidence between her majesty and her allies was entirely destroyed, and the French king made absolute master of the negotiations of peace, and the affairs of Europe given into his hands.

Article IX.

“ That, to impose upon the allies the fatal necessity of submitting to the terms of France, and, in order thereto, to leave the whole confederate army at the mercy of the common enemy, he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer was privy and consenting to a secret and separate concert with the ministers of France, without the knowledge of the allies, for the separating the troops in her majesty’s pay from the rest of the confederate army; for the effecting whereof, instead of preventing as far as in him lay so fatal a step, he was not only wanting to advise against so unwarrantable a proceeding; but did consent to, and advise her majesty, that the duke of Ormond, and all the troops then in her majesty’s pay, or such of them as would obey his orders, should separate themselves from the army of the confederates; and, having notice that the generals of the auxiliaries paid by her majesty, whose honour and consciences would not permit them to abandon the confederates and leave them as a sacrifice to France, but, for the sake of the common interest of Europe and according to the true end and design, of their conventions, did refuse to withdraw with the duke of Ormond without particular orders from their respective masters; he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, being then lord high treasurer of Great Britain, and one of her majesty’s most honourable privy council, in violation of his oath, and the duty and trust reposed in him, .did take upon himself an arbitrary and illegal power to refuse and put a stop to the pay and subsidies due on ac* count of the said foreign troops, although they were entitled thereto by the conventions entered into with her sacred majesty, and by express provision made by act of parliament for the payment of the same: by which fatal separation, which, pursuant to his evil counsels, was afterwards made, great numbers of the confederate troops, who had before, on many occasions, signalized themselves in the defence of the cause of Europe, soon afterwards, at the unfortunate action of Denain, fell as sacrifices »

the fury and revenge of France; ttie siege of Landrecy was raised; the important towns and fortresses of QuesnOy, Bouchain, and Doway were retaken by the French army; and not only the fortune of the war* but the fate of Europe, decided in favour of France.

Article X.

“ That, in further execution of his pernicious designs, to complete the destruction of the common cause of Europe, and to render it impracticable for her majesty to resume the war against France in conjunctiod with her allies, or to recover the union with her majesty's old and faithful allies, so.necessary to the preservation of these kingdoms, he the said Robert earl Oxford and earl Mortimer, then lord high treasurer of Great Britain, did carry on and concert, with the ministers of France, a private and separate negetiation, for a general suspension, by sea and land, between Great Britain and France; and, to that end among others, did advise her majesty to send over Henry viscount Bolingbroke, one of her principal secretaries of state, to the court of France, with powers to settle the said suspension:in’ pursuance of which, a destructive treaty of suspension was made in France, on the 19th of August (N. S.) 1712, by the said Henry viscount Bolingbroke on the part of her said majesty, for four months, without the knowledge or any participation of the allies, and before any terms of peace were settled with the enemy, either for Great Britain or the allies. By which evil counsels, the express terms of several of the aforementioned treaties were expressly contravened and broken, the good friends and ancient allies of her majesty and these kingdoms were totally deprived of the just assistance to which they were thereby entitled, and were left exposed to the insults of the common enemy; and, the sacred ties of union and friendship between her majesty and her allies being cut asunder, her majesty’s person and government, the safety of her kingdoms, and of the Protestant succession to the crown of these realms, were left Exposed to the enterprises of her most formidable enemy.

Article XT.

“ That whereas the States General of the United Provinces were, in or about the months of September or October in the year of our Lord 1712, in possession of the strong and important town and fortress of Tournay; and whereas the French king had, during.the course of the said private, separate, and traiterous negociation between him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer and others, and the ministers of Franco, signihed his consent to the ministers of Great Britain, that the said town and fortress of Tournay should remain to the said States General, as part of their barrier; and whereas her majesty, in her instructions of December 23, 1711, t her plenipotentiaries at Utrecht, had expressly directed them to infist with the plenipotentiaries of France, in the

1711, there was open war between her late majesty and the French king, and, the said war continuing, for all the said time and afterwards, the said French king and his subjects were enemies to her majesty, he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, then lord high treasurer of Great Britain and a subject of her majesty, not considering the duty of his allegiance, but having altogether withdrawn the cordial love and true and due obedience which every true and faithful subject owed to her said majesty, and designing to give aid and succour and to adhere to the said French king, did, in or about the months of September or October

1712, during the said war, falsely, maliciously, wickedly, and traiterously aid, help, and assist, and adhere to the French king, then an enemy to her late majesty; and, in execution and performance of his said aiding, assisting, and adhering, maliciously, falsely, and traiterously, did counsel and advise the said enemy, in what manner, and by what methods, the said important town and fortress of Tournay, then in the possession of the States General, might be gained from them to the French king, contrary to the duty of his allegiance, and the laws and statutes of this realm.

Article XII.

w That whereas her late majesty queen Anne, not only in pursuance of the treaties she stood engaged in to her good allies, and in particular to his imperial majesty, for the recovery of thq monarchy of Spain to the House of Austria, thereby to preserve a due balance of power in Europe; but also from her just resentment against the duke of Anjou, who then styled himself king of Spain, and who, in defiance of her majesty’s title to the crown, had acknow? ledged the Pretender as king of Great Britain; and on these just foundations, her majesty had in-vindication of the honour of the crown, and in justice to her people, at a vast expence of blood and treasure, and on the earnest and repeated advices of her parliament, prosecuted a vigorous war against the said duke of Anjou and whereas in the years of our Lord 1710, 1711, and 1712, the said open, bloody, and expensive war was carried on, betjveen her said late majesty queen Anne aod the said duke of Anjou; and, during all the time aforesaid, the said war did continue; and, for all that time the said duke of Anjou and the subjects of Spain adhering to him were enemies of her late majesty; he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, then lord high treasurer of Great Britain and-one of her majesty’s ptivy

, Article XIII.

That whereas the riches, power, and strength of these kingdoms, depend entirely on the flourishing condition of trade and navigation:and her late majesty queen Anne, having due regard thereto, as well as to the just expectations of her people after the vast expences they had so cheerfully undergone in support of the war, -did, on the first opening of the conferences for a general peace, declare from the throne, to both Houses of Panliament, on the 7th of December 1711, * That she would endeavour that,

‘ after a war which had cost so much blood and

* treasure, the nation might find their interest

* in trade and commerce improved and en-

* terms of peace obtained for her own subjects

* were such as, she had reason to expect, would make her people some amends for the great and unequal burthen which they had lain ‘ under through the whole course of the war;

acknowledgments to her majesty, for her great care and concern for the welfare of her people. And whereas, at the setting on foot and in the progress of the said private, separate, and pernicious negociation, between trie ministers of Great Britain and France, it was laid down as a principle, on the part of Great Britain, never to be departed from, 4 That France should consent to adjust the interests of Great Britain ‘ in the 6rst place, that the ministers of Great ‘ Britain might thereby be enabled to engage ‘ the queen to make the conclusion of the ge-‘ neral peace easy to Franceand on this plausible pretence, it was insisted on by the ministers of Great Britain, to remit the discussion of the particular interests of the allies to general conferences; and throughout the whole course of the said separate negociation, all imaginable concessions were not only made by the ministers of Great Britain, for the real advantage of the interests of France, against the allies; but all measures were entered into and concerted between them, that even the ministers of France should dictate, in order to strengthen their hands, and to enable them to impose the terms of a general peace; he, the said Robert earl of Oxford ana earl Mortimer, having nothing in view, through the whole course of the said negociation, wherein he was wickedly and principally engaged in concert with France, but the final destruction of his country, and to that end the sacrificing the commerce of Great Britain to the aggrandizement of France, was not only wanting in his duty to her majesty, in not insisting on in all events, and not procuring in the first place, the most certain and strict securities imaginable, for the safety and advantage of the commerce of these kingdoms; but did advise her late majesty, That, in the proposition sent by bis

* privity and advice by Mr. Prior, to France,

4 and also in the said private and separate

‘ treaty; signed on the said 27 th of September 4 1711, wherein the preliminary demands for

* Great Britain more particularly were intended

* to be adjusted with France; the demands for' 4 Great Britain, in point of commerce, should

4 not only be made in loose, general, and insuf- fleient terms; but that the liberty of fishing, and drying of fish, on Newfoundland, should be ‘ expressly given up to France; though the restitution of that small part of the island which 4 'France had taken during the war was therein

* referred to be discussed to general confer- eaces And having, by his wicked artifices, engaged her majesty in the said private treaty with France, without any security for the commerce of Great Britain, he did artfully and cunningly contrive, with the ministers of France, to keep in suspense all matters that concerned the commerce of Great Britain, until, by means of his wicked and pernicious counsels aforementioned, France was become master of the negociations, and the chief advantages Svf' the

’ commerce of Great Britain by that means remaining unsettled; and the ministers of Frances afterwards disputing the most essential articles

Which had been in agitation, and in particular that fundamental principle of treating and being treated as gens amicissimand endeavouring

fo elude what bad been agreed on in the said private and separate negociation, for the supposed advantage of Great Britain; he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, under pretence of removing a difficulty then depending by an expedient advantageous to Great Britain, did treacherously advise the 9th article of the treaty of commerce with France; a bill for the rendering whereof effectual was afterwards rejected by the House of Commons as highly prejudicial and destructive to the commerce of these kingdoms:but, yet, for the soke of gaining that destructive article for Great Britain, as if the same had been advantageous, he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, in defiance of the express provision of an act of parliament, as well as in contempt of the frequent and earnest representations of the merchants of Great Britain, and of the commissioners for trade and plantations, did advise her majesty, finally to agree with France, That the subjects of France

4 should have liberty of fishing, and drying fish,

4 on Newfoundland ; * and did also advise her majesty to make a cession to Franceof the isle of Cape Breton, with liberty to fortify the same; although the isle of Cape Breton was part of the ancient territories of the crown of Great Britain, and her majesty had declared, from the throne, That France had consented to

* make an absolute cession of Nova Scotia, or

* Acadia, whereof Cape Breton is part, to her

* majesty and the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer intending, in all events, to secure Co France the advantages relating to the fishery of Newfoundland and to Cane Breton, did In conjunction with the ministers of France, advise her majesty to consent that the same should be made an article in the treaty of peace between Great Britain and France: whereas the only advantages in trade pretended to be stipulated for Great Britain, being inserted in the treaty of commerce, were to depend on certain conditions, to be made good by act of parliament; and pursuant to, and by the influence of, the said evil counsel of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, her sacred majesty was advised to ratify the said article in the said treaty of peace, and the said treaty of commerce; by means of which pernicious Counsels, the good intentions of her sacred majesty, to have obtained for her people advantageous terms of commerce, were intirely frustrated; the trade and manufactures of Great Britain, as far as in him lay, rendered precarious; and at the mercy of the enemy; and that beneficial branch of trade, always esteemed the great support of the naval power and the chief nursery of the seamen of Great Britain, yielded up to the subjects of France; and the -only pretence for the avowed and 'notorious violation of treaties, und the- carrying on the measures of France, viz., the adjusting first the interests of Great Britain, through, the

whole course of the , said private and separate negociation, terminated at last in the sacrifica of the commerce of Great Britain to France, without the least shadow of advantage in trade procured for these kingdoms.

Article XIV.

* That he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer did, in concert with other evil and false counsellors, even without any application from his royal highness the duke of Savoy, and after the French king had, in the course of the said private and separate negotiations, consented that the kingdom of Sicily should remain to the house of Austria, form a project and design to dispose of the kingdom of Sicily to the duke of Savoy, from the house of Austria; and, to effect that his unjust, dishonourable and pernicious project, he did advise her majesty to give instructions, among other things, to Henry viscount Bolingbroke, then appointed her ambassador to France, to demand, in her majesty’s name, of the French king, the kingdom of Sicily, for his said royal highness:and a treaty of peace being afterwards made, between the French king, his royal highness, and the duke of Anjou, wherein a cession is made to his royal highness of the kingdom of Sicily, without any concurrence or participation of his imperial majesty he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer did basely and scandalously adviae her sacred majesty to consent to the same, by an article inserted in the treaty of peace between her majesty and the French kiny; and afterwards, by his privity and advice, her majesty was prevailed on to a-sist his royal highness against the emperor, then in alliance with her majesty, with a part of her royal fleet, .at her own expence, in order to put him in possession of the said kingdom of Sicily, whereby the greatest injustice was don to his imperial majesty, in direct Violation of the grand alliance, and contrary to her majesty’s frequent declarations from the ihrone, and her plain and full instructions to her plenipotentiaries at, Utrecht, for obtaining his just and reasonable satisfaction; and whereby national faith, and the honour of the crown, was vilely betrayed, and the naval power of these kingdoms, and the supplies granted by parliament for reducing the common enemy, were perfidiously employed against the great and faithful ally of this kingdom.

Article XV.

u That whereas the dignity and support of tha imperial crown of these realms has in all ages greatly depended on the wisdom and truth of the communications made from the throne, especially in parliament, as the sure and only means whereby the kings and queens of this realm can receive the sincere and faithful advice of their people, in matters of the highest importance; and which, by the fundamental laws and constitution of this government, ought to be inviolably observed, as the sacred band of the duty and affection of subjects to their sovereign,

99] PARL. HISTORY, 1 George I.

and whereas, by the most ancient and known laws of this kingdom, it is indispensably incumbent on the great officers of state that surround the throne, to maintain, as far as in them lies, the sacredness of the royal word on all occasions; it being most apparent that the greatest dishonour to the throne, and the greatest danger to these kingdoms, must inevitably ensud, whenever that fountain of truth, by wicked counsels, shall be in any degree corrupted, and thereby lose its just influence and necessary authority: and whereas the power of making peace and war, one of the ancient, undoubted, and most important prerogatives of the crown, has always been exercised by the sovereigns of these realms with the strictest regard to the honour of the crown and the welfare of the people, and for that end they have, in great wisdom, in all ages, taken the advice of parliament on such weighty occasions: and whereas her late majesty qpeen Anne declared from the throne her gracious intentions to communicate the terms of peace to her parliament, for their deliberate and serious advice therein; wisely foreseeing, that the safety of her person and government, of the protestant succession to the crown, which she had nearest her heart, and of the protestant religion, and of the liberties of Europe, did inevitably depend on the happy conclusion of the said negotiations: he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, then lord high treasurer of Great Britain, having taken on himself, throughout the said negotiations, a most arbitrary and unwarrantable authority, and the chief direction and influence in her majesty's councils, and most wickedly designing to prostitute the honour of the crown and the dignity of parliaments, and not only totally to deprive her majesty of the wholesome and necessary advice of her parliament in so great a conjuncture, but, by misrepresenting the most essential parts of the negotiations of eace, to obtain the sanction of parliament to is traiterous proceedings, and thereby fatally to deceive her majesty, her allies, her parliament, and her people; he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer was not only wanting in the discharge of that duty to his sovereign which became his high station, by not advising against, and, as far as in him lay, in all events, by hot preventing, even any intimation .from the throne to the parliament, which was npt conformable , to the exactest truth and impartiality; but, taking advantage of his r^ady access to her majesty, and his exorbitant influence in her councils, did prepare, form, and concert, together with other false and evil counsellors, several speeches and declarations, to be made by her majesty from the throne, to her parliament, on the subject of the said negotiations of peace; and did advise her majesty to make the same to her parliament: &Dd particularly, by means of his false and evil counsels, her majesty did, amongst other things, on the 7th of December 1711, declare from the throne, in the words, or to the effect following, That, notwithstanding the arts of those who delight

1715. — Articles of Impeachment [1()0

* in war, both' place and time are appointed

* for opening the treaty of a general peace: our ‘allies, especially the States General, whose

* interest 1 look upon as inseparable from my ‘ own, have, by their ready concurrence, expressed their confldence in 1116:* Whereas it was then notorious to all Europe, and the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer and others his accomplices well knew, that the principal allies of her majesty, and particularly the States General, then had in the strongest and mqst pressing manner represented, not only to her majesty’s ministers in Holland, but afterwards by a minister of their own directly to her majesty, the insecurity and danger to the common cause, by entering into general negotiations with France on the propositions signed by monsieur Mesnager, and also their firm opinion of the fatal consequences that might ensue thereon: and although they had still great apprehensions concerning the method of opening the conferences, and the consequences that might happen thereupon; yet, being wrought on by the menaces and ether extraordinary methods used with them by her majesty's ministers, and relying on the solemn assurances and declarations of her majesty to support the interest and concern of their state, and to act in perfect confidence and harmony with them, they did at last with the greatest reluctance consent to enter upon a general negotiation of peace with France. And, in the same speech, her majesty was prevailed on, by the evil counsels of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer and others, to declare in the words or to the effect following: ‘ that the ‘ princes and states which have been engaged ‘ with us in this war being by treaties entitled (to have their several interests secured at

* peace; I will not only do my utmost to pro-‘ cure every one of them all reasonable satis-‘ faction: but 1 shall also unite with them in tha ‘ strictest engagements for continuing the alli-‘ ance, in ordtr to render the general peace se-

* cure and lasting.” And, in her message of the 17 th of January following, her majesty again expresses the care she intended to taka of all her allies, and the strict union in which she proposed to Join with them; whereas, by the evil influence of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, her majesty wag not only induced to enter into a private negociation with France, exclusive of her allies; but the same was in like manner carried on by him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer and others: and the several interests which the allies were entitled to by their treaties were not only not secured to them by the peace, nor any reasonable satisfaction given to them; bat the main interests of her principal allies, especially of his imperial majesty, were, . by the wicked practices of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer and others, given up to France; and no engagemenis were obtained for continuing the alliance, in order to render the general peace secure and lasting. And her majesty having on many former occasion *

4 '

101] PARL. HISTORY, 1 George I.

expressed her resolutions, never to make peace . with France and Spain, so long ns Spain and the West Indies remained in the house of Bourbon: she was prevailed upon, by the advice of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer and others, to declare herself, in answer to an address of the house of peers, the 11th of December 1711, to the effect following: videlicet, ‘ I should be sorry

* any one could think I would not. do tny ut-

* most, to recover Spain and the Indies from

* the house of Bourbonwhereas it is most manifest, that the leaving the kingdom of Spain and, the Indies in the house of Bourbon was the foundation of the private and separate treaty between Great Britain and France, which had been before that time signed even with her majesty's consent; and the same fundamental resolution was immutably observed between them, to the conclusion of the peace. And her majesty having frequently declared from the throne, that her resolutions in entering into ‘ the said negociations were, to obtain a general,

* good, atad lasting peace; and the plenipoten-

* tiaries at Utrecht being instructed to treat

* with France conformably to that end; ' he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, in order to remove the just suspicions which had been conceived of his private and separate negociations with France, did advise her majesty to make this further, declaration, in her said message of the 17th day of January, that the

4 world will now see how groundless those re-

* ports are, which have been spread abroad by

* men of evil intentions to serve the worst ‘ designs, as if a separate peace had been treat-‘ ed *, for which there has not been the least 1 colour given; ' whereas a private and separate negociation had been carried on, for five months together, between Great Britain and France; and, during that time, private propositions had been sent from England, and a private treaty with a minister of France, signed even by her majesty's privity, exclusive of all the allies, before the said declaration made by her majesty; and private and separate measures were thenceforth carried on, by the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer and his accomplices, on behalf of her majesty, with the .ministers of France, even to the conclusion of the peace with France. Her majesty was further prevailed on, by the wicked advice of him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, in her speech of June the 6th, 1712, to declare,

* that, to prevent the union of the two crowns,

* she would not be content with what was speculative, but insisted upon something solid; ' and, in the same speech, to the effect following;

(videlicet,) the nature of the proposal fora re-

* nunciation is such, that it executes itself, and

* France and Spain are thereby more effectually

* divided than ever:' whereas the ministers of France had before that time assured the ministers of her majesty, 1 that to accept of the ex-

4 pedient proposed on her majesty's behalf,

* Sic.

1715. — against the Earl of . [1(>$

* would he to build on a sandy foundation:and ‘that the renunciation would be null and void by

* thefundamentallaws of France; and that they

* would deceive themselves, who accepted it as an expedient to prevent the union of the two

* crowns.' And not only in the particulars beforementioned, but in many others, contained io the said several speeches and messages made and sent to her parliament, even while the said negociations of peace with France were depending, the most essential points relating to peace and commerce, and which concerned the interests as well of the allies as of' Great Britain, were grossly misrepresented; by all which wicked, treacherous, and unexampled t evil counsels, be the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer did most basely, ungratefully, and scandalously, abuse the favour of his royal mistress; and, by ifieans of her authority, did mislead her parliament into groundless and fatal resolutions; and thereby not only prevented the just advice of the parliament to her majesty in that critical juncture, but obtained the approbation of parliament to his mysterious and dangerous practices; and did not only deprive her majesty of the confidence and affection of her allies, hut exposed her majesty and her people to the contempt of the common enemy.

Article XVI. 1

“ That whereas the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, having on all occasions used his utmost endeavours to subvert the ancient established constitution of parliaments, the great and only security of the prerogative of the crown, and of the rights, liberties and properties of the people; and being most wickedly determined, at one fatal blow, as far as in him lay, to destroy the freedom and independency of the House of Lords, the great ornament and nearest support of the imperial cro^wn of these realms; and falsely intending to disguise his mischievous purposes under a pretended zeal for the prerogative of the crown; be the said Robert carl of Oxford fend earl Mortimer, on or about the months of December or January 1711, whilst the House of Lords were under an adjournment, and had reason to expect, that on their next meeting, matters of the highest importance would be communicated to them from the throne; they having some few days before given their bumble opinion and advice to her majesty,

4 That no peace could be safe or honourable to Great Britain or Europe, if Spain and the West

effects of the said advice ofN the House of, Lords, and in order to obtain such future resolutions of that house of parliament, on the important subject of the negociations of peace, ms might shelter and promote his secret and unwarrantable proceedings, together with other false and evil counsellors, did advise her majesty to make and create twelve peers of this realm and lords of parliament; and, pursuant to his destructive counsels, letters patents did forthwith, pass, and writs issued, whereby .twelve peers were made and created; and did likewise advise her majesty immediately to Call and summon them to parliament; which being done accordingly, they took their seats in the House of Lords on or about the 2d of January If 11, to which day the House then Stood adjourned; whereby the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer did most highly abuse the influence he then had with her majesty; qnd prevailed on her to exercise in the most unprecedented, and dangerous manner that valuable and undoubted prerogative, which the wisdom of the laws and constitution of this kingdom hath entrusted with the crown for the rewarding signal virtue and distinguished merit: by which desperate advice, he did not only, as far as in him lay, deprive her majesty of the continuance of those seasonable and wholesome counsels, in that Critical juncture *, but wickedly perverted the true and only end of that great and useful prerogative, to the dishonour of the crown, and the irreparable mischief to the constitution of parliaments: all which crimes and misdemeanors were committed and done, by-him the said Earl, against oar late sovereign lady the Queen, her crown and dignity, the peace and interest of this kingdom, and in breach of the several trusts reposed in him the said Earl; and he the saitl earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer was lord high treasurer of Great Britain, and one of her majesty’s privy council, during the time that fill ami every the crimes before set forth were done and committed: for which matters and things, the knights, citizens and burgesses, of the House of Commons, in parliament assembled, do, in the name of themselves and of all the Commons of Great Britain, impeach the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer of high treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanors in the said articles contained.

“And the said Commons, by protestation, saving to themselves the liberty of exhibiting, at atiy time hereafter, any other accusations or impeachments against the said earl, ' and also of replying to the answers which the said Robert earl of Oxford, and earl Mortimer shall make to the premises, or any of them, Or to any impeachment or accusation that shall he by them exhibited according to the course and proceedings of parliament; do pray, that the said Robert earl of Oxford and carl Mortimer be put to answer ell and every the premises; and that such proceedings, . examinations, trials, and judgments, may be upon

them, and every of them, had and used, as shall be agreeable to law and justice; and they do further pray and demand, that the said Robert earl of Oxford'and earl Mortimer may be sequestered from parliament, and forthwith committed to safe custody.”

After debate the question for adjourning was put, and carried in the negative, by 86 voices against 54; thereupon the Articles of Impeachment were read. Then a motion was made. That the Judges be consulted; that the House might be satisfied, whether the charge contained in the said Articles amounted to treason ? The lords Trevor and Harcourt, the dukes of Shrewsbury and Leeds, earl Powlet, the lord North and Grey, the bishop of Rochester, and some other peers of the same side, were for consulting the judges; but the lord-chancellor, the dukes of Argyle and Montrose, the earls of Nottingham, Sunderland, Dorset, and llay; the lord viscount Townshend, and some other lords, spoke against it. The lord Trevor having ' gone so far, as to declare his opinion, That none of the articles amounted to high-treason, ' he was answered by the lord Cowper, who shevoed the contrary, and challenged all the lawyers in England to disprove his arguments. The other side still insisting on consulting the judges, the earl of Nottingham represented to them, That instead of favouring thereby the noble person, who had the misfortune to be impeached, as undoubtedly they meant it, they might, on the contrary, do him a great prejudice. For if, upon consulting the judges, they declared the charge to amount to treason, he would stand prejudge ^, before he was brought to his trial. After some other speeches, the negative was carried by 84 voices against 512.

The Earl of Oxford*sSpeech in his own

fence.] It was then moved, That the earl ef Oxford be committed to safe custody in she Tower, which occasioned another debate* Hereupon,

Debate on the said A] The lord Coningsby having left the said Articles with the Lords, and being withdrawn, a motion was made, That the consideration of the Articles of Impeachment be a'djourned to the Monday following, which was hacked by

The Bishop of Rochester (Dr. Francis Atterbury) who urged, That tins accusation was of so extraordinary a nature, and so wry important, both in itself and its consequences, that the House ought to proceed-on it with the utmost caution and deliberation. He was an-syvered by

. The Duke of Argyle, who said, It was well known, the prelate who spoke last, had, of late, studied more politics than divinity; and was thoroughly acquainted with the subject matter of the Articles that lay before them; and therefore his grace did not doubt, but his lordship was now as ready to speak to them, as lie could ever be, if he had more time to consider of them.

K>5] PARL. HISTORY. 1 CcoMt I, 1715. — In his own Defence. [100

The Earl of Oxford stood up, fend spoke in his own defence as follows;

“ My lords; It is a very great misfortune for any man to fall under the displeasure of so great and powerful a body as the Commons of Great Britain: And this misfortune is the heavier upon me, because I had the honour to be placed at the head of the late ministry, and must now, it seems, be made accountable for all the measures that were then pursued. But, on the other hand, it is a very great comfort to me under this misfortune, that I have the honour to be a member of this august assembly: An assembly which always squares their proceedings and judgments by the rules of honour, jtxstioe, and equity; and is not to be biassed by a spirit of party.

“ My lords; I could say a great deal to clear myself of the charge which is brought against ltoe: But as I now labour under an indisposition of body, besides the fatigue of this long sitting, I shall contract what I have to say in a narrow compass. This whole accusation may, it seem6, be reduced to the negociation and conclusion of the peace: That the nation wanted a peace, 'no body will deny; and, I hope, it will be as easily made out, that the conditions of this peace are as good as could be expected, considering the circumstances wherein it was made, and the backwardness and reluctancy which some of the allies shewed to.come into the Queen’s measures. This is certain* that ibis peace, as bad as it is now represented, was approved by two successive parliaments. It is, indeed, suggested against this peace, that it was a separate one: But I hope, my lords, it will he made appear, that it was general j and that it was France, and not Great Bntavn, that made the first steps towards a «e . go-iation. And, my lords, I will be bold to say, that during my whole administration, the sovereign upon the throne was loved at home, aod feared abroad.

* As to the business of Tom-nay, which is made a capital charge, I can safely aver, that I had no manner of share in it; and that the tome was wholly transacted by that unfortunate nobleman who thought fit to step aside: But I dare say in his behalf, that if this charge could -be proved, it would not amount to treason. For my own part, as I always acted by the immediate directions and commands of the lute queen, and never offended against any known law, I am justified in my own conscience, wnd unconcerned for the life of an insignificant old mam But I cannot, without the highest ingratitude, be unconcerned for the best of queens:A queen who heaped upon me honours and preferments, though 1 never asked for them; and therefore I think myself under an obligation to vindicate her memory, and the measuresehe pursued, with my dying breath.

4‘ My lords; If ministers of state, acting by die immediate commands of their sovereign, are afterwards to be made accountable for their proceedings, it may, one day or other, be the case of all the members of tbit august assem-

bly:I de not doubt, ' therefore, that out of regard to yourselves, your lordships will give me an equitable hearing; and I hope that, in the prosecution of this inquiry, it will appear, that I have merited not only the indulgence, but likewise the favour of the government.

“ My lords; I am now to take my leave Of your lordships, aod of this honourable House, perhaps for ever! I shall lay down my life with pleasure, in a cause favoured by my late dear royal mistress. And when I consider that I am to be judged by the justice, honour, and virtue of my. peers, I shall acquiesce, and retire with great content: And, my lords, God’s wiU be done.”

Before the question for committing the Call of Oxford to safe custody was put, the duke of Shrewsbury acquainted the House, That the said Earl was, at present, very much indisposed with the gravel; and therefore he hoped the House would not immediately send him to the Tower, but suffer him to be, for two or three days, under the custody of the Black Rod at his own house, where he might have the. attendance and assistance of his relations and servants: That however he did not propose this as a motion, because be was against committing him at all, but only left it to the consideration of the House. His grace was seconded by the earl Ponlet; and no opposition being offered, the earl of Oxford withdrew, leaving word with the Usher of the $lack. Itod, that he would be at home.* After this the question wa9 put, That the said Earl be committed to safe custody, which was carried in the affirmative, by 82 voices against 50; and so the House rose about a qdarter past one in the morning: when the Usher of the Black Rod went to the earl of Oxford’s house, communicated to him the order of the House of Peers for taking him into custody, and left some of his officers for that purpose in his lordship’s house. It was observed, that of twenty bishops who were that day in the House, six only were for the earl of Oxford, vix. The archbishop of York, and the bishops of London, Rochester, Bristol^Chester, and Durham.

July 11. The Lords ordered, That the earl of Oxford be brought to the bar of their House the next morning, in order to be sent t• the Tower.

The Earl of Oxford voted to the Tower'] July IS. The earl of Oxford was, according to order, brought to the bar of the House of Lords, where having received a copy of the Articles of Impeachment against him, lie represented to their lordships, “That the ablest men in the nation had been many weeks iii drawing op those long Articles against him: and therefore he hoped the House wbuld allow him a proportionable time , to answer them.”

* << When the earl of Oxford went home, lie was attended by a mob that cried oat, High-f Church, Ormond, afed Oxford for ever.’ Oldmitton.

His lordship took that occasion to return their lordships his hearty thanks for their great humanity in not sending him to the lower the Saturday before; and as he still laboured under the same indisposition of body, he humbly desired their lordships* to permit him to continue some few days more at his own house, under the custody of the black rod.* '

The Earl of Oxford being withdrawn to the black rod room, the Lords resolved to allow him a month to answer the Articles of Impeachment; and as to his last request. Dr. Mead, one of his lordship’s, physicians, being consulted, and having made an affidavit, “ That if the earl were sent to the Tower, his life would be in dangerA motion was made, “ That he might continue in his house till the Monday followingbut this was opposed, and after debate it was carried, by 81 voices against 55, that he should be carried to the Tower on Saturday next *

In this day’s debate,

The Earl of Anglesea, having said, “ That it was to be feared these violent measures would tnake the sceptre shake in the king’s hands several members were offended at this suggestion, and some cried, “ the Tower, ” and others only “ te order.”

The Earl of Sutherland standing up, said, uHe trembled with indignation to hear such words pronounced in that noble assembly; that if they had been spoke any where else, be would call the person that spoke them to an accountBut all he could do there was

The earl of Oxford was by many blamed for putting off his goitig to the Tower; which they said did not correspond with that firmness be had hitherto shewn.' It is certain, as he came in his own coach to the House of Lords he might with as much ease have been carried to the Tower either by water, or in a sedan, and have bad there the same attendance of his friends and physicians. The House having met on Friday, the 15th of July, they adjourned to Monday following, to avoid, as it was generally surmised, any fresh motion, which the earl of Oxford’s friends might make for deferring his being sent to the Tower, where he was carried by the black rod on the day appointed, about eight o’clock in the evening, in his chariot, attended by two hackney coaches, in which Were his lady, his son the lord Harley, and some other of the earl’s relations and servants. Though these three coaches went from his .bouse, near St. James’s palace, up St. James’s street, and then through Piccadilly, Gerard Street, Monmouth street, and Holbourn, with design to avoid a, crpwd, yet were they attended by a great many of the common people, whose numbers being much increased in their return from the Tower, they raised a tumult in the streets, with their cry of High-church, Ormond, and Oxford tor ever, upon which three or four of the mutineers were by the constables carried to the round-house.” Tindal.

to move that he might explain himself. He

was seconded by

The Duke of Roxburgh, who said, “ Thqt the scepter was so well rivited in the king’s hand, that instead of shaking, it would crush all his majesty’s enemies.” The earl of Berkley and some other lords backed also the carl of Sutherland’s motion:whereupon

The Earl of Anglesea stood up, and said, “ That it was but too manifest, by the riots that were daily committed in several parts of the kingdom, that the nation in general was against these Impeachments; that for his own part, he was so far from approving those tumultuous assemblies and disorders, that he rather wished a stop might speedily be put to them, by exemplary punishments; That he had on several occasions, given sufficient proofs of his zeal and affection for the Revolution and the Protestant succession; that wffiat he had now advanced, was the result of the s^me zeal for the peace and prosperity of his majesty’s reign: however, if he had been so unhappy as, by any unguarded or passionate expression, to give offence to that august assembly, he was very sorry for it.”

Notwithstanding this apology, some members were inclined to have his lordship sent to the Tower, but the very words he had spoken not having been taken down in writing, the House admitted his lordship’s explanation; and so that matter went no further. It is observable that on this occasion, besides the six bishops before mentioned, those of Bath and Wells, and St. David’s, voted for the earl of Oxford.

Address of the Commons respecting the Tumults.*] July 16. The Commons unanimously resolved, That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, that he will be graciously pleas ed to give directions to the several magistrates throughout the kingdom, That the laws may be put in a speedy and the most vigorous execution against all such persons, who shall be found any way concerned in the late rebellious and tumultuous riots and disorders committed, and

• “ The day before the earl of Oxford was sent to the Tower, the House of Commons received information of their tumultuous proceedings in Staffordshire, where several meeting-houses had been pulled down by the mob. Upon this the Commons unanimously resolved to address the king, that the laws might be put in a speedy and most vigorous execution against the rioters, and an account be taken of such justices, as failed in the discharge of their duty; and that the sufferers, by these riots, may have a full compensation for their damages, which they would enable his majesty to make good, out of the next aids granted by parliament. The king, in his answer, promised an immediate compliance with their request, and hoped by their seasonable assistance, to suppress tip spirit of rebellion, and establish peace and prosperity.” Tindal,

Ordered, That a Committee be appointed to draw up an Address, upon the said resolution.

July 18, Mr. Solicitor General reported from the said committee the following Address, which was agreed to nem.

Most Gracious Sovereign;

* We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons in parliament assembled, being highly concerned at the continued en-\ deavours of the enemies of your person and government to disturb the tranquillity and happiness of youp kingdoms, and to deprive your people of the great blessings they enjoy under your auspicious reign; and it having appeared to us, that, by the encouragement, and th\a false and traiterous insinuations, of persons disaffected to your title and government, great numbers of your. poor deluded subjects have been prevailed upon, in many parts of the kingdom, to assemble together, and, in a tumultuous and rebellious manner, to commit great disorders, and do great injuries to others of their fellow-subjects and fellow-protestants; we think it our indispensable duty, on this occasion, to express our Utmost abhorrence of all such traiterous proceedings, and our highest resentment against the authors and promoters of them; and to renew to your majesty the hearty and vigorous resolutions of your faithful Commons to support your majesty, and your government, against all your open and secret enemies; and to contribute the utmost iu our power to the honour and safety of your sacred person, and the quiet and^secdrity of your government:

* And to that end, we crave leave most humbly to beseech your majesty, that you will be graciously pleased to give directions to the several magistrates throughout your kingdom?

I. 171$. — King's Answer. [j 10

that - the laws now in force may be put in speedy, and in the most vigorous, execution, against all such persons as shall be found any way concerned in the rebellious and tumultuous riots and disorders which have been committed, and are now carrying on, by persons disaffected to your majesty, and your government; and that a strict inquiry may be made to discover the authors and promoters of them, so as they may be brought to copdign punishment:

“ And it being apparent, that the neglect or misbehaviour of many justices of peace, and other magistrates, have given great encouragement to the said disorders, we crave leave, in all humility, to beseech your majesty, that an account may be taken of such justices of the peace, as have failed in the discharge of their duty ou these occasions; and that such of them as shall appear to your majesty to have neglected their duty, may be forthwith put out of the commissions of the peace; and that such other magistrates, as shall likewise appear to your majesty to have neglected their duty therein, may be proceeded against with the utmost rigour of the law. \

“ And as your loyal Commons are fully assured, that, by the wisdom and steadiness of pur administration, the sceptre in your royal and will soon become a terror to all those, who, by open or secret practices, shall any way abet the enemies of your person or government; so, from our most dutiful regard to your majesty, and in justice to those of your subjects, who for their zeal, and firm adherence to your majesty, and your government, have been sufferers in the said tumultuous and traiterous disorders, we do most humbly beseech your majesty; that you will be most graciously pleased to give directions, that ah exact account may be taken of the losses and damages which any of your subjects have sustained by reason of the said tumultuous and rebellious proceedings; and that the sufferers may have full compensation made them for their damages; your faithful Commons most humbly assuring your majesty, that all expences which shall be incurred on that account, shall be made good to your majesty out of the next aids that shall be afterwards granted by parliament:

“ And, for the security of your sacred person, and the quieting the minds of your faitnfol subjects, we do further moat humbly advise your majesty, that you will be graciously pleased to give orders, that the magistrates throughout , the kingdom, in their several stations, do speedily and effectually put the laws in execution against papists and non-jurors."

The King’s Answer.] To this Address, bit Majesty gave the following answer:

“ Gentlemen:

“I thank you heartily for your address, and the many marks of zeal and affection which you express for my honour and safety, and th§

security of the kingdom. — I wiH give knmt-dkce directions for putting in execution the several matters which you so justly recommend to me; And ssl am resolved on aU occasions, to follow the advice of my Parliament; so I have no doubt, but that, by the blessing of Almighty God, and your seasonable and vigorous assistance, 1 shall soon be enabled effectually to suppress that spirit of rebellion, which is so industriously fomented among uS, and to establish the peace and prosperity of my people.”

The King's Speech relating to an Invasion by the Pretender.] July 20. The king came to the house of peers and passed several acts. Then his majesty, after conferring with the Lord » Chancellor, spate as follows:

u My lords, and gentlemen; I Have given direction to my Lord Chancellor, to declare to you, in my name and words, a matter I think of the greatest importance.”

Th^n the Lord Chancellor spake as follows: MI have received his majesty's commands, to deliver to you, in his name, this his majesty's speech, now put into my hand by his majesty from the’throne.

“ My lords, and gentlemen,

MThe zeal you have shewn for preserving the peace of my kingdoms, and your wisdom, in providing so good a law to prevent all riotous and tumultuous proceedings, give me

Seat satisfaction; but I am sorry to find, at such a spirit of rebellion has discovered itself, as leaves no room to doubt but these disorders are set on foot and encouraged by persons disaffected to ray government, in expectation of being supported from abroad. — The preservation of our excellent constitution and the security of our holy religion, has been and always shall be, my chief care; and I cannot question but your concern for these invaluable blessings is so great, as not to let them be exposed to such attempts, as, I have certain advices, are preparing by the Pretender from - abroad, and carrying on at home by a restless party in his favour.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons;

“ In these circumstances, I think it proper to ask your assistance; and make no doubt but you will so far consult your Own security, as not to leave the nation, under a rebellion actually begun at home, and threatened with an invasion from abroad, in a defenceless condition:And I shall look upon the provision you shall make for the safety of my people, as the best mark of your affection to me.”

The Lards' Address thereon.'] Hit majesty, having retired, the Lords agreed upon the following address:

* Moat gracious sovereign; We, your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords spiritual and temporal m parliament assembled, beg leaveto return your majesty the most humble thanks of this House, for your majesty's most (vasisus assurances, .That the preservation of

c ©or excellent constitution, and the security of ‘ our holy religion, has been, and always shall he your chief careand for communicating to your parliament the advices from abroad, of an intended invasion of these kingdoms, countenanced and encouraged by insurrections here at home, fomented and stirred up by the abettors and supporters of the Pretender’s interest. And we do most humbly assure your majesty, that this House will stand by and assist your majesty, at the hazard of our lives and fortunes, in support and defence of your sacred person, and your undoubted right and title to the crown in defiance of all your open and secret enemies.” v

The King's Answer.] The said Address being the next day presented to the king, hie majesty gave this Answer:,

“ My lords; .

“ I thank you for the zealous affection you express towards me, and the assurances which you give mein this address; and you may depend on my punctually making good all those which I have given to my people, either on this or any former occasion.”

Address of the Commons.] The Comiponf being returned to their House, it was resolved, nem. con. “ That an humble Address be present* ed to his majesty, to return the most humble and dutiful thanks of this House to his majesty, for communicating to his parliament, the advices he has received of an attempt preparing to be made upon the nation from abroad, abetted and encouraged by treasonable practices at home, in favour of ajsopish Pretender: and to assure his majesty, that this House will, with their lives and fortunes, stand by and support his majesty against all his open and secret enemies; and to desire his majesty, that he will immediately give directions for fitting out such a number of ships as may effectually guard the coasts, and to issue out commissions for augmenting his forces by land; assuring his majesty, this House will, without loss of time, effectually enable him to raise and maintain such a number of forces, both by sea- and land, as shall be necessary for the defence of kis sacred person, and for the security of his kingdoms. *

After this Mr. Freeman stood up, and represented “ That in so important a juncture, they ought to lose no time in drawing up an address; and therefore moved, That the said resolution be forthwith laid before his majesty by the whole House.” He was seconded by

The lord- Guernsey, who said, “ It was well

known he had, on many occasions, differed from some members in that House; but being now convinced that our liberty, religion, and all that is dear to Englishmen, were aimed at, he would (laying his hand on his sword) rather die with his sword in his hand, than survive the Pretender's coming in, though he were r to enjoy the greatest honours and preferments under him.' *

Mr. Hampden having likewise backed Mr, Freeman's motion, it passed into a resolution, nem. eon. and Mr. Boscaweo, who was ordered

113]' PARL. HISTORY, 1 George I. 1715. — [114

to wait on the king to know his majesty’s pleasure, when he, would be attended by the House, having, about six in the evening, reported, that his majesty had been pleased to appoint immediately at his palace at St. James’s.

The King's Answer.] The House went thither, with their speaker, and laid before his majesty the said resolution, to which the king was pleased to return the following answer.

* Gentlemen; I thank you heartily for this Address. The zeal and vigour which you shew upon this occasion, will, £ trust in God, enable me to defeat the evil designs of our enemies. I will immediately give directions for such an increase of our forces, by sea and land, as I shall judge necessary for your security; and will order estimates of the charge thereof to be laid before you.'”

Address to the King, to allow the Officers on half pay full pay.] July 26, Mr. Robert Walpole took notice, “ of the measures the king had taken, pursuant to the desire and advice of that House, to secure his dominions; but represented, that in case of an invasion, the standing troops and new levies would hardly be sufficient:and as he thought it necessary, so he moved, that the officers in half-pay should be put in a capacity to serve the nation, by allowing them full pay.” Mr. Secretary Stanhope seconded Mr. Walpole’s motion; and general lloss only having made a slight objection to it, suggesting, that, to save expences, the standing regiments might be augmented, it was resolved, “ That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, that he would be graciously pleased to allow full pay, to such half-pay officers as were not otherwise»provided for; and that his majesty would give orders to the said officers to hold themselves in readiness, to be employed in such manner as his majesty should think fit; and to assure his majesty, that this House will supply such extraordinary expence as his majesty should be at on this account, out of the next aids to be afterwards granted by parliament."

This Address being the same day presented to the king, his majesty was pleased to say, “ That he looked upon it as a fresh instance of the duty and affection of this 'House, and of their zeal for the security and preservation of his people and government."

Article I.

“ That whereas, ia or about the month of January in the year 1710-11, a dangerous and destructive Expedition had been projected and set on foot, under the pretence of making a conquest on the possessions of the French king in North America; but with a real design to promote his interests, by weakening the con* federate array in Flanders, and dissipating the naval force of this kingdom; as well as for the sake of the private interest and corrupt gain of the promoters of the said expedition; be the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, being then one of her late majesty’s privy council and one of the commissioners of her majesty’s treasury, was not only wanting in his duty to her late majesty, by wilfully and in-dostriously absenting from the meetings of other persons then in high trust under her majesty, wherein the said Expedition was concerted; and, by not advising her majesty against, and doing what in him lay to have prevented, the putting the same in execution; but did, contrary to his oath and the high trust then reposed in him, advise her majesty to consent to. the making an expedition for the conquering Canada, and the city of Quebec, on the river of St. Laurence, in North America:and, iu execution of his said evil councils, he did further advise her majesty to give orders for detaching several battalions of the forces then in the service of her majesty in conjunction with her allies in Flanders, and to send the same, with a large squadron of men of war, on the said epterpr&e; although the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer well knew, that the said project or expedition, having been frequently deliberated on, and maturely Considered a short time before in a committee of council, was then laid aside as dangerous and impracticable: and a demand being made, at the treasury, on or about the months of May and June 1711, for the sum of 23,000l. ur thereabouts, on pretence of arms and merchandizes said to be sent on the said expedition to Canada; he the said Robert earl

of Oxford and earl Mortimer, being then lord high treasurer of Grent Britain and one of her majesty’s privy-council, though he well knew, jot had reason to suspect, that the same was an Unjust and exorbitant - demand, and a great abuse on her majesty and the public, and such as ought not to have been complied with, was not only wanting in his duty to her majesty, in not giving his humble advice against the said demand, or at least in not representing to her the ground of such his suspicion; but did, contrary to his oath and his duty, advise her majesty, that the said sum should be issued and paid, and did accordingly countersign a warrant to the paymaster of her majesty’s forces for the payment of the same; pursuant to which, the same was issued and received; and, in further violation of his oath, his duty, and trust, and with the most corrupt design to prevent the justice due to her majesty and tba nation, he the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, being then lord high treasurer of Great Britain, and exercising a most unexampled arbitrary power, not only in her majesty's private councils, but extending his evil influences to the great council of the nation, after the said expedition had proved unsuccessful, and it had been discovered to him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer that the nation bad beeh cheated of above 20,000l. on that account, did most ungratefully and corruptly employ his wicked arts, and the credit which he had gained by his many false and crafty insinuations and practices, to keep the House of Commons from examining that affair; and, in or about the month of August 1714, in a letter or memorial, under his own hand, to her late majesty, he did presume, not only to insinuate the ill opinion he therein pretended always to have had of the said expedition, but did declare the suspicions he had of the great injury and abuse done to her majesty and the public, in the demand of the said 28,000l., even at the time when the same was made, and that the public had been cheated of above 20,000l. on that account; nnd, in the said memorial, did presume further to declare to her majesty, That he was

and embezzled, and a heavy debt incurred otf the nation; not only sitting the parliament, but even in contempt and defiance of a representation made by the House of Common* to the throne, even whilst the said expedition was concerting; and whereby the highest injustice was done, in suppressing an inquiry set just' to her Majesty and her people; and a lasting reproach and scandal brought on that House of Commons; of which he boasts, as having been wrought on, by his corrupt influence, not to examine into so high and scan? dalous an abuse.

the preservation of them, did, together with other false and evil counsellors, form a most dishonourable, wicked, and cruel contrivance, not only for. abandoning the Catalans to the fury and revenge of the duke’of Anjou and his adherents, but for the final extirpation of all their rights, liberties, and privileges; and, in execution of that his intention, during thepri-vate, separate, and pernicious negotiation of peace, which was carried on between him and the ministers of France, and before any.negociations of peace was set on foot in due form of law, tween the crowns of Great Britain and Spain, did advise her majesty to give directions to the lord Lexington, her ambassador to the court of Spain, to acknowledge the duke of Anjou king of Spain; but was greatly wanting in Ins duty to her majesty, in not advising her to give instructions to h$r said minister, at the same time, peremptorily and absolutely to insist on the'securing the Catalans liberties, at the conclusion of the peace: And although the private, separate, and treacherous practices of . him the said Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer and others, in combination with the ministers of France, did afterwards, on or about the 14th of March 1713, necessitate hi* present imperial majesty to conclude a treaty for the evacuating Catalonia, whereof her majesty was guarantee, without any express and positive stipulations for the Catalans liberties f his imperial majesty relying in that respect on her majesty's declaration to interpose for them in the most effectual manner, and on the promises of the French king to joiu his endeavour* for the same purpose; and although her sacred majesty did, both before and after, frequently declare, by her ministers in Spain, “ That she thought herself under the strongest ties of honour and conscience, not to abandon a people, whom the necessities of the war had obliged her to draw into her interestand though the French king did not join his endeavodrs for_the purposes aforesaid; he the said Robert earl x of Oxford aud.earl Mortimer, together with other false and wicked counsellors, having, from time to time, amused and deceived the distressed Catalans with groundless hopes of her majesty's effectual interpositions in their favour, thereby engaging them in a more obstinate defence of their territories against the duke] of Anjou, was not only highly wanting ia his duty to her majesty, by not doing what in him lay, as a faithful minister, to have prevented the conclusion of the treaty of peace with Spain, till just and honourable conditions were secured for the Catalans; but did, falsely, maliciously, and treacherously advise her majesty to conclude a peace with the king of Spain, without any security for the ancient and just rights, liberties, and privileges, of that brave, but unhappy nation; and did further advise her majesty to send sir James Wishart, her admiral, with a large squadron of men of war, at a great expense, to favour the 'said king of Spain in the Siege of Barcelona, thecae pita! city of Catalonia; and with express In-

* he had received for that purposebut also, to induce the -said generals of the confederate army and the States deputies to comply with his proposal to them to abandon the siege: be the said James duke of Ormond did wickedly represent their compliance therein as the most effectual way to induce her said late majesty to take care of the said confederates interest at the peace; whereby he the said James duke of Ormond did, in effect, threaten her said majesty's good friends and allies, 4 That, 4 unless they would dishonourably abandon an enterprise undertaken by common consent, and thereby save a strong fortress and a numerous garrison of the enemy, they were not to expect that her majesty would take care of their interests at the general peace.

The Duke of Ormond being gone off is a attainted.} But the duke of Ormond on the 21st of July before, embarking privately on board a vessel on the Kentish coast, landed in three days in France: upon which the Com-. monS, August the 10th, ordered a Bill to be brought in to summon and attaint him in like, manner as the lord viscount Bolingbroke.

The Dutchess of Ormond's Petition to «*-large the Duke's time for appearance.} Aug. 18. A Petition of the most noble Mary dutchess of Ormond, wife of his grace James duke of Or*i mond, was presented to the House of Lords, and read; setting forth, “ That, her husband the said duke being beyond sea, the uncertainty of finding him out, and the difficulty of giving him notice of the bill depending in thi* House, to attaint him of High-Treason unless, he renders himself by the tenth of September next, is so great, that it will bo almost impossible for him so to do, in so short a timeand praying “ In regard, the estate, the life, the>hoM nour, of a peer of Great Britain, and the welfare of so noble and ancient a family, is at stoke r that this House will give him a larger time for rendering himself, that be may have an opportunity to convince their lordships and

’ die world of his innocence, as to the crimes whereof he is impeached.’'.

And the statute of 17 Car. 2, for attainting Thomas Doleman, Joseph Bampfield, and Thomas Scot, of high-treason, if they render not themselves by a day, being read; and debate touching the said Dutchess’s' request; Ordered, That the said petition do lie on the table. Ordered, That, for the safety of his majesty’s person and government, this House will proceed further this day upon the above mentioned bill: That the House be now put into a committee of the whole House upon the said bill.

Protests against the Bills of Attainder against Lord Bolingbroke and the Duke of Ormond.] Aug. 18. The Bill intituled “ An act for the attainder of Henry viscount Bolingbroke, of High-Treason, unless he shall render himself to justice by a day certain therein mentioned, ” was read a third time.

• The question was put, whether this bill shall pass ? It was resolved in the affirmative.

“ Dissentient,

u 1st, Because we cannot give onr consent to the affirming, that the lord to be attainted by this bill is fled from justice, being known to have left England before he was impeached in parliament; nor does it appear to us, that the lord so impeached has had any summons to return, or legal notice, by proclamation or otherwise, of the charge brought up against him.

“ 2dly, Because no particular proofs have been laid before the House of any high treason, or other high crimes or misdemeanors with which he stands charged:nor has any evidence been given to this House of his adhering to the king’s enemies; or being concerned in any traiterous design since he left England.

“ 3dly, Because the time prescribed for his return is much shorter than, what has been allowed to persons in like circumstances of supposed guilt, though of far meaner condition and character; nor do we know or believe, that there is any instance of any person whatsoever, who was ont of the kingdom at the time of his being impeached in parliament, who has not had a longer day assigned for his. return, before he was to stand and be adjudged, attainted, or actually incur any other high pains mad penalties inflicted by act of parliament.

“ And we think such allowance of a longer day, in the case of attainders by parliament, to be much more reasonable, as it is agreeable, *ot only to parliamentary usage, but to the methods of common law, * in all cases of outlawry, whereby more months are allowed to the most notorious traitor (known to be fled from justice) "for his coming in, before his outlawry can be recorded, than this act allows weeks, to the lord impeached, for his returning before his attainder takes place. — Fra.

ARTICLES of IMPEACHMENT, of High Crimes and* Misdemeanors, against THOMAS Earl of STRAFFORD.

u Whereas his late majesty king William the Third, of ever glorious memory, out of his great wisdom and tender regard for his own kingdoms and the Protestant succession, and to vindicate the honour of the crown and nation, then affronted by France, in proclaiming the Pretender king of Great Britain, after the French king had but lately before acknowledged his majesty’s title to the same, as well as from a just concern for the preservation of the liberties of Europe, against the growing power of France, which was then become more formidable from the duke of Anjou’s having taken possession of the entire Spanish mo-rmrey, did, upon the advice and request of both Houses of Parliament, in or about the month

It45] PARL. HISTORY, S Gionos I.

of September 1701, enter into, make, and conclude, a treaty with Leopold emperor of Germany and the States General of the United Provinces; wherein a strict conjunction and alliance amongst themselves being thought necessary for repelling the greatness of the common danger, it was, amongst other things, agreed, “ That there should be and continue, between the said confederates, a constant, perpetual, and inviolable friendship and correspondence; and that each party should be obliged to promote the advantages of the other, and prevent all inconveniences and dangers that might happen to them, as far as lay in their power: That the said allies, desiring nothing more earnestly than the peace and general quiet of all Europe, had adjudged, that nothing could be more effectual for the establishment thereof, thnn the procuring an equitable and reasonable satisfaction to his imperial majesty for his pretensions to the Spanish succession; and that the king of Great Britain and the States General might obtain' a particular and sufficient security for their kingdoms, provinces, and dominions, and for the navigation and commerce of their subjects: That it should not be permitted to either party, when the war is once begun, to treat of peace with the enemy, unlessjointly and by a communication of councils; and bo peace should be made, unless an equitable and reasonable satisfaction, for his imperial majesty, and a particular security for the kingdoms, provinces, demmions, navigation, and commerce, of his majesty of Great Britain and the States General, b» first obtained; and unless care betaken, by ntting security, that the kingdoms of France and Spain shall never come and be united under the same government, nor that one and the same person shall be king of both kingdoms. And whereas his said late majesty king William and the States General, seriously considering that France was then become so formidable, from the accession of Spain to the duke of Anjou, that, in the opinion of all the world, Europe was in danger of losing her liberty, and undergoing the heavy yoke of universal monarchy; and that the surest means of effecting that design were, to divide the Mng of Great Britain from the States General, for which purpose all imaginable efforts would be made; they therefore thought it necessary to unite in the strictest manner that was possible; and, to that end, a defensive treaty and alliance was concluded and entered into between them, in or about November 1701, wherein amongst other things, it was further agreed, That by

* the alliance with the emperor, made in Sep-

* tember then last, particular care being taken

* for the recovery of the Spanish Low Countries out of the bands of the most Christian

* king, the said confederates expressly engaged

* to aid one another with all their forces for

* the recovery of the same; and in regard the

* principal interest of the said confederates

* consisted in the preservation of the liberties

* of Europe, that the beforementioned treaty

with the emperor ishall be faithfully and sincerely executed, and both sides shall guarantee the Same, and use their endeavours, to confirm and render it more strong from time to time: That, in making peace, particular care shall be taken of the commerce and traffic, of both nations, and also for their security' as well in regard to the Lew Countries at to the countries adjacent: That, when the war is begun, the confederates shall act in concert, according to the seventh and eighth articles of the treaty of the 3rd of March 1667-3, between England and Holland, which was thereby renewed and confirmed; and no peace nor truce, or suspension of arms, shall be negociated or made, but according to the ninth and tenth articles of that treaty; by which it was agreed, that, when the two allies came once to an open war, it shall be \ lawful for neither of them afterwards to come

* to any cessation of'arms with him who shall ‘ be declared and proclaimed an enemy, with-

* out it be done conjointly and with common ‘ consent; that no negotiation of peace shall

* be set on foot by ooe of the allies, without4 f the concurrence of the other; that each ally

‘ shall continually, and from time to time, im-1 part to the other every thing that shall pass in

* the said negotiation; and shall stipulate with

* the common enemy for the same rights, immu-‘ nities, exemptions, and prerogatives, for his ‘ ally, as he snoutd do for himself, if so be said 1 allies do not agree to the contrary/ And whereas the French king, having got possession of a great part of the Spanish dominions, exercised an absolute authority over that monarchy, having seized Milan and the Spanish Low Countries by his armies, and made himself master of Cadiz and of the entrance into the Mediterranean, and of the ports of the Spanish West Indies, by his fleets, every where designing to invade the liberties of Europe, and-to obstruct the freedom of navigation and commerce; and, . insread of giving the satisfaction that was justly expected, had, proceeded to further violences, and indignities; and, having influenced Spain to acknowledge the Pretender, and thereby to concur with him in the said-affront; her late sacred majesty queen Anne, taking notice,

* that she found herself obliged, for maintaining

* the public faith, for vindicating the honour of the crown, and to prevent the mischiefs which

* all Europe were threatened with, to declare.

‘ war against France and Spain/ did accordingly, in the month of May 1702, in the most public and solemn manner proclaim the same; as his imperial majesty and the States General did likewise do, in or about the said month of May, in pursuance of the beforementioned treaties. And whereas many kings, .princes, and states of Europe, being invited by the said grand alliance, and relying on the faith thereof did afterwards become parties to the said coni federate war against France and Spain; and, in the treaty entered into in or about the month of May 1703, between his imperial majesty, the, queen of Great Britain, the States General, and

147] PARL. HISTORY, ^Gpobq* J, \1\5.-~ Articles tfhtyatkment

the king of Portugal, it was, amongst other things, expressly stipulated, That no peace or

* truce shall be made, but by the' mutual con *

* sent of all the confederates; nor shall any at

* any time be made, whilst the second graod-f sop of the most Christum king, by the dauphin

* or any other prince of the line of France, con-

* tinued in Spain.* And whereas, to give the greatest strength that was possible to the Union 60 necessary to both nations, her late majesty and the States, by a treaty in the month of June 1T03, renewed and confirmed all treaties and alliances then subsisting between them; apd, to the end a just and reasonable peace might the better be obtained, that might establish the repose and tranquillity of Europe, it was agreed, that neither of the said allies should make a suspension of arms or a peace with France or Spain, but in conjunction and by common consent. And whereas the said war was for several years carried on with vigour and unanimity, at a vast expenee of blood and treasure: for the support of which, on the part of Great Britain, many millions were granted by parliament, who, on many occasions, expressed their sense of the justice of k, and frequently gave their humble advice to the throne,

* fhat no peace could be safe, honourable, or lasting, so long as Spain and the West Indies continued in any branch of the house of Bour-‘ bon.” And whereas the just cause of her majesty and her allies, in defence of the common liberty, and in vindication of the honour of the crown of Great Britain, was favoured by the Divine Providence with unparalleled success and signal victories, whereby, as well as by the wisdom and unanimity of their councils, the reputation of the confederate arms was highly advanced, and Great Britain was esteemed the guardian of the liberties of Europe. And whereas, from the prosperous condition of the affairs of the allies, nothing remained, in all human appearance, but that they should reap the fruits of all their victories, in a speedy, just, honourable, and lasting peace; and on the other hand nothing was left to raise the hopes of the enemy, whereby to defeat that happy prospect, but his secret endeavours to disunite the confederacy. And whereas divers evil-minded persons, enemies to the true interests of their own country as well as, to the common liberties and welfare of Europe, having, by many wicked arts and base insinuations, obtained access to her late majesty queen Anne, and being admitted into her councils and into places of the highest trust, and having formed a wicked and treacherous correspondence with the emissaries of France, and set on foot a private and destructive negotiation of peace, thereby intending to weaken and dissolve the confederacy, which had so long and happily subsisted, between her majesty and her good and faithful allies, to the honour and safety of the nation; had prevailed upon her said late majesty, for that purpose, to declare her resolution of entering into a treaty of peace with die ComoiQn enemy, against the consent and opi-

nion of nil her majesty's allies; and also appoint John then lord bishop of Bristol and, Thomas earl of Strafford her plenipotentiaries, to transact the same at Utrecht. And whereas her sacred majesty, in pursuance of the treaties she stood engaged in, and of her declaration in the month of April 1711 to the Grand Penr-sionary and the other ministers of Hqlland, being still determined, in making peace as in making war, to act in perfect concert with her allies, and, in conjunction with them, to demand and procure from France a just satisfaction for all their pretensions, according to, and in performance of, the many solemn treaties and alliances then subsisting between her mar* jesty and thetri, did, in pursuance thereof, . by her instructions under the sign manual, dated the 31st of Octoher 1711, - to him the said Thomas earl of Strafford, her ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the States^ General, direct him, “ That, during the course of the then intended negotiation of peace, it must be the most careful endeavour and the fixed principle of all the confederates, to hold fast together, in order to obtain from the enemy the utmost which could be hoped for in the present circumstances of affairs; and' tjiat he might assure the confederates, that her majesty on her part would firmly adhere to that rule; and that she was so far from making peace without the concurrence of the States General, that she had declared her firm resolution, nob to make it without their satisfaction; ” And also, by her instructions under the sign manual to the said then bishop of Bristol and him the said Thomas earl of Strafford, her plenipotentiaries, to treat of a good and general peace, her said majesty, amongst other things, did direct them, Upon their arrival at Utrecht, to concert with the ministers of tha allies, in what manner it might be most proper to open the conferences, and what method to observe in the progress of the treaty; upon that and all other occasions, earnestly to represent to those ministers the great importance of appearing united; and, for that reason, to recommend to them, ' that, if any difference or dispute should arise, the same should be ao- commodated amongst themselves, that France might have no hold to break in upon them;

4 but, on the contrary, whenever they meet the enemies* ministers in the Congress, every opinion that is delivered, and every instance that is made, may be backed by the concurrent force* of the whole confederacy: That, if it should be thought proper to begin by the disposition of the Spanish monarchy, they vtero to insist, that the security and reasonable satisfaction, which the allies, expected, and which his most Christian majesty had promised, could not be obtained, if Spain and die West Indies be allotted to any branch of the house of Bourbon.* Notwithstanding all which premises;

of her majesty’s privy council, and her ambassador extraordinary to the States General, and appointed one of her plenipotentiaries to treat with the ministers of France, of a good and general peace, in concert with the ministers of her majesty’s allies, who for that purpose were assembled at Utrecht, with those of Frahce, with full powers to transact the same; having no regard to the true ends of his said commissions and powers, to the honour or safety of her majesty or her kingdoms, to the many solemn engagements she was under to the old and faithful allies of this nation, or to the common liberties of Burope; but being devoted to the interest and service of the French king, the then common enemy, in defiance of the tenor of the several treaties before-mentioned, or dome of them, as well as of the frequent advices of parliament, and the many declarations of her majesty from the throne; but more particularly in defiance of the solemn and mutual assurances which had been So lately renewed between fier majesty and the States General, to act in perfect concert with each other, in making peace as in making war, and of the Several instructions from her majesty under the sign manual to him the said earl in pursuance thereof? was not only wanting in his duty and trust to her majesty, by not advising against, and as far as was in his power, by not opposing, the going into any private separate negotiation With France?" but, en the contrary, when a separate, dishonourable, and destructive negotiation of peace was entered into, between the ministers of Great Britain and France, without any communication thereof to her majesty’s allies, according to the several treaties; he the said earl did not only take upon himself, and presume, from time to time, to advise and exhort that the same should be continued and carried; but did likewise frequently concert private and separate measures with the ministers of France, in order to impose upon and deceive her majesty’s good subjects and her allies, Ttad was instrumental in promoting the said separate negotiation, exclusive of all the allies, and to their manifest prejudice and detriment. And further, he the said earl, when the ministers of France, at Utrecht, refused to answer in writing, and on many other occasions, proceeded in a fallacious and unjustifiable manner, in transacting the negotiations of peace; was not only wanting in his duty, in not representing to her majesty and her ministers against the same, and in not supporting in the manner he ought to have done her majesty’s good allies iii their reasonable demands from France; but, on the contrary, commended the French prudence in taking such measures; and even suggested himself the methods for France to make use of, to Create dissentions amongst the allies, and separate negotiations between each of the allies and France, thereby to dissolve the whole confederacy. By which wicked and treacherous practices? he the said eafl prostituted the ho-kidtir of her majesty and the imperial crown of these realms, and grossly Violated hirpowers

and instructions, the biany treaties which her majesty thdft stood engaged in to her allies, and the repeated assurances which the said earl had, by her majesty’s order and in her name, giveft to the said allies, to act in perfect Concert With them throughout the whole negotiations of pCacC; thereby rendering the design 6f the confederacy, and the mutual support expected from the same, altogether useless, and giving u& the affairs of Burope into the hands of Franco.

Article II.

“ Whereas the maintaining a perfect uniod and good correspondence between her lat4 majesty and the illustrious bouse of Hanove£ was of the utmost importance, for preserving t6 these kingdoms the invaluable blessings of theif religion and civil liberties by securing the succession to. the crown, by a race of protestant princes, ever renowned for their great justice and clemency, and thereby defeating the traitorous designs of the Pretender; and, for that purpose, the great wisdom of divers parliaments, had fixed and confirmed the said succession, had also laid the obligation of an oath upon thO subjects of these realms, to support and maintain the same to the utmost of their power; bd~ the said Thomas earl of Strafford, not regarding the many ill consequences to her majesty and these kingdoms, which would naturally ensue from a disunion or coolness of affection between princes so nearly allied in blood and interest, instead of doing what in him lay to prevent the same, did, on the contrary, in his letters fr‘>m Holland to her majesty’s ministers of state in Great Britain, by divers false representations and scurrilous reflections upon his present most gracious majesty, then elector of Hanover, endeavour to alienate her majesty’s affections from his said electoral highness, and to create or widen fatal differences or misunderstandings between them.* and when, by the wicked and pernicious advice of him the said Thomas earl of Straftord and divers other evil counsellors, her late majesty was at last pre-" vailed upon to make a fatal cessation of arms With the then common enemy, without hny concert with his said electoral highness, and against the consent, and contrary to the most earnest representations, of all the allies; for the execution of which he the said earl was sent over tp. the army in the Netherlands, where the generals of the auxiliaries paid by her majesty, whose honour and consciences would not permit them to abandon the confederates, and leave them as a sacrifice to France, refused to withdraw with the duke of Ormond, without particular orders from their respective masters; which proceedings of the confederate generals being wickedly represented by the said evil counsellors, in conjunction with the ministers and emissaries of France, as an indignity offered to her Sacred majesty; he the said Thomas earl Of Strafford, to create uneasinesses and dissension between her late majesty, and his then

And further, he the said Carl, by frequently affirming, and sometimes in the most solemn manner, to the ministers of his said electoral highness as well as others, the most notorious and manifest untruths, contrary to the intentions and interest of her majesty, and vainly intending thereby to deceive and impose. upon his said electoral highnats and the rest of her majesty's good and faithful allies in matters of the highest importance; and particularly, by Solemnly affirming, on or about the 16th of July, 1712, to Monsieur Buleau, general of the Hanover forces, and the rest of the confederate generals, that her majesty, had made no truce

* with France ; ' whereas he the said earl then well knew the same was made and concluded several weeks before; did thereby, as well a* b^ all the before mentioned proceedings, not ©nty prostitute and dishonour the high characters he was then invested with, but, as far as in him lay, did dissolve the mutual confidence and good understanding so necessary to be maintained between her said late majesty and the illustrious bouse of Hanover, for the safety and prosperity of Great Britain, and the common fcberty.of Europe.

Aiticle III.

44 Whereas, in the pernicious negotiations of peace carried on by him the said earl and other fvil counsellors with the ministers of France, the French king had proposed to acknowledge ]»er majesty's title to the crown of these realms, d the protestant succession in the illustrious use of Hanover, when the peace should be signed between Great Britain and France, and $ot before: whereupon the House of Lords, by *n humble address to her majesty, on the 15th of February 1711, begged leave to represent {heir just indignation at that dishonourable treatment of her majesty; as also their utmost resentment at the terms of peace offered to her majesty and her allies by the plenipotentiaries Of France; for which addresses her majesty was pleased to return them her hearty tbanks, for the zeal they had therein expressed for her honour; he the said earl was not only wanting in his duty to her majesty, and zeal for the protestant succession, in not advising her majesty against treating with France upon such dishonourable terms; but did himself, with Other evil counsellors, privately, wickedly, and traitorously, concert and agree with the ministers of France, that the said proposals, so derogatory to the dignity of her majesty, and dangerous to these kingdoms, should be the conditions upon which France would agree to trert.of a peace with Great Britain. And further, he the said earl, in contempt and defiance of the judgment of the House of Peers which had received her majesty's graciens approbation, and

acting the part of an emissary of France instead of a plenipotentiary of Great Britain; being thereunto encouraged, and founding his pro* sumption on a letter to the then bishop of Bristol and him the said earl, from Henry Saint John esquire, then principal secretary of Mate, on the 16th of February 1711, the next day after the said address of the House of Peers wae made, and informing them of the indignation: expressed in Great Britain at the offers of France, but that by the management of master Thomas Harley (then secretary of the treasury) the House of Commons was perfectly and absolutely secured to the measures of peace; did wickedly, deceitfully, and perfidiously, conceit and agree with the ministers of France, at Utrecht, that the said French ministers should write a collusive letter to him the ?aid earl and the then said bishop of Bristol, wherein her majesty should be styled queen of Great Britain; which letter was not to be made any use of at Utrecht, or taken as an acknowledgment by France of her majesty's title to the crown s but was agreed to be transmitted to Great Britain, thereby to deceive and impose upon her majesty and the parliament, as if France had then actually acknowledged Hie same: which said letter was accordingly written by the ministers of France, and transmitted to Great Britain by. him the said earl; whereby her majesty, the parliament, and the whole nation were most grossly and scandalously abused, and drawn in to the said destructive measures of peace, to the great dishonour of her majesty and these kingdoms, and to the apparent danger of the Protestant Succession *

Article IV.

41 That he the said Thomas earl of Strafford, in defiance of the many treaties between her majesty and her allies, for the recovery of the monarchy of Spain to the house of Austria, thereby, to preserve a due balance of power in Europe; and in contempt of the advice and opinion of parliament, ‘That no peace could ‘ be safe, honourable, or lasting, so long aa ‘ Spain «uid the West Indies continued in any

* branch of the House of Bourbon; ' and also in direct violation of her majesty's instructions, of the 23d of December, 1711, in pursuance thereof; whereby be the said earl was'expressly commanded, ‘ To insist in the confer-

France, ‘ That Spain ami the West Indies " should be restored to the House of Austria; ’ and requested him the said earl, ‘ to join with ‘ them, to strengthen that demand, ’ did decline and refuse to do the same: by which perfidious and unwarrantable practices of him the said Thomas earl of Strafford, incurable jealousies and discords were created between her majesty and her allies; that mutual confidence, which had so long and so successfully been cultivated betweeu them, and which was. so necessary for their common safety, was absolutely dissolved, the just balance of power in Europe was wickedly betrayed; and apparent advantages were given to the Common enemy, to impose what terms of peace he should think fit upon her majesty and the whole confederacy.

Article Y.

“Whereasher late majesty, on the 7th of December, 1711, having earnestly recommended from the throne, ‘That provision might ‘ be made for an early campaign, in order to " carry on the war with vigour, and as the best way to render the treaty of peace effectual; ’ and accordingly supplies were grantee}, and magazines provided at a great espence; and in pursuance thereof, her majesty having given early assurances to her allies of her sincere intentions, and likewise expressly instructed her general the duke of Ormond, not only to renew the same assurances, and declare her resolution of pushing on the war with the utmost vigour, out to concert with the generals of the ^llies the proper measures for entering upon action; which assurances were accordingly given by the said duke, and the confederate army was thereupon ordered to be assembled, which at that time was the strongest that had been in the service during the whole course of the war, and greatly superior to that of the enemy; notwithstanding which premises, he the said Thomas earl of Strafford, then of her majesty’s privy council, being informed.of the reasonable prospect, which, by the blessing of God, the army of the confederates then had, of gaining new conquests over the army of France; in order to disappoint the expectations of the allies; and to give success to the secret and wicked negociations then carrying on by himself and other evil counsellors with the tninisters of France; on divers very false and groundless suggestions and allegations, and in violation of the many treaties then subsisting - between her majesty and the States General, as well as several other princes, at several times, and particularly by his letter of the 50th of April, 1712, to Henry viscount Bolingbroke, then Henry St. John, esq. one of her majesty’s principal secretaries of state, did wickedly and treacherously suggest and advise, that a cessation of arms should be made with France, by her majesty, without and even against the consent of her good allies and confederates: in pursuance of which wicked counsels and advices, directions were afterwards privately sent, in her m*y«aty’s name, to the duke of Ormond, in

Flanders, to avoid engaging in anyt siege, or hazarding a battle, till further orders, although nothing had been then settled in the said private negotiations for the interest and security of Great Britain. And further, he the said Thomas earl of Strafford, at that time also of her Majesty’s privy council, did advise her late majesty that he himself should, be sent, , and accordingly he was afterwards sent, from England, to, the army under the duke of Ormond in Flanders, with directions, in her majesty name, to cause a cessation of arms to be made and proclaimed between her majesty and the French army, and a separation to be made by the troops of Great Britain from the confederate army; which were accordingly performed and executed, by the advice and direction of him the said earl, without the consent, and contrary to the. earnest representations of her majesty’s confederates, and in open violation and defiance of the many treaties then subsisting between her majesty and her good and faithful allies: by which wicked and perfidious counsels and practices of him the said Thomas earl of Strafford, the progress of the victorious arms of the confederates was stopped, and a.most favourable opportunity lost for con-, quering the enemy; all hopes of confidence between her majesty and her allies were entirely. destroyed, and the French king mad* absolute master of the negotiations of peace.

Article VI.

“ That he the said Thomas earl of Strafford having, in concert with other false and evil counsellors, ' wickedly advised and procured the said fatal cessation of arms, and likewise obtained for France the separation of the troops of Great Britain from the confederate army; in further execution of his treacherous purposes, to advance and promote the interests of France; and being determined, as fat as in him lay, not only to render all future correspondence and good harmony between her majesty and the States General utterly impracticable; but designing, by all possible means, to weaken and distress the said States, in order to bring them under an absolute necessity of complying and submitting to the measures of France; and well knowing that taking possession of Ghent and Bruges was the readiest means of effecting the same; did wickedly and treacherously advise that a party of the queen’s troops should be sent to march through some of the towns belonging to the States General; in hopes, that the commanders f the said towns, incensed by such unjust and unnecessary provocations, and through the apprehensions of the ill consequences that such attempts and proceedings might subject them 1 to, would be induced to refuse them admittance, and thereby give a pretence for putting in execution the perfidious designs and resolutions which had been concerted by him the said earl, and other evil counsellors, with the ministers of France: in pursuance of which wicked advice, a party of her nuyesty’s troops was

by

155J PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 1715.-7%* *f Orford'* Answer [15G

accordingly sent with orders to inarch through some of the fortified towns belonging to the States General; and on pretence of tbfcir be* ing denied passage through the same, the said treacherous and* destructive design was immediately put in execution, and Ghent and Bruges were seized upon by the troops of Great Britain; whereby, all means of communication between Holland and the confederate army being entirely cut off, or put into the bands of those who had so. lately and shamefully betrayed the common cause, apparent advantages and encouragement were given to the French army, and her majesty’s good and faithful allies were deterred from forming or prosecuting any designs against the common enemy; since the same could not be put in execution without their knowledge and consent, who, on many occasions, had given Che most evident proofs of their disaffection to the confederates, and of their firm adherence to the interests of France. All which crimes and misdemeanors were committed and done by him the said earl, against our late sovereign lady the queen, her crown and dignity, the peace and interest of this kingdom, and in breach of the several trusts reposed in him the said earl; and he the said earl of Strafford was of her late majesty’s privy council, her ambassador extraordinary to the States General, and one of her plenipotentiaries, to treat of a good and general peace with France, during the time that all and every the crimes before set forth were done and committed. And the said knights, citizens, and burgesses, by protestation, savifig to themselves "the liberty of exhibiting at any time hereafter any other accusation or impeachment against the said Thomas earl of Strafford, and also of replying to the Answer that the said Thomas earl of Strafford shall make unto the said Articles, or - any of them; or of offering proof of the premises, or any other impeachments oy accusations that shall be exhibited by them, as the case shall (according to the course of parlia-miament) require; do pray, that the said Thomas earl of Strafford be put to answer the said crimes and misdemeanors, and receive such condign punishment as the same shall deserve; and that such proceedings, examinations, trials, and judgments, may be upon every One of them had and used, as are agreeable to law and justice.”

Debate thereon.] The above Articles having

been read,

The Earl of Strafford stood up, and com-

Elainedof the hardship that had been ppt upon im, by seizing his papers *, in an unprecedented manner. That be designed to have drawn

* The king having thought fit to have the earl of Strafford’s papers, relating to his public negociatioos, laid before the council, the lord Townshend was sent to his lord-.hip’s house to demand the same. The earl having made some difficulty to comply with that demand, unless he

up and printed an account of all his negotiations, whereby, be did not doubt he should have made it appear to all the world, that he had done nothing but in discharge of his duty, and of the trust reposed in him. That if either in his letters or discourses, while he had the honour to represent the crown of Great Britain; . he had droptany unguarded expressions against, some foreign ministers, he hoped the same would not be accounted a crime by a British House of Peers. Concl uding with desiring, that a competent time be allowed him to answer the Articles now brought against him; and that he might have duplicates of all the papers, that either had been laid before the Committee of Secrecy, or were still in the hands of the verument, which might be for his justifies* tion.

The Lord Townshend said, that his complaint about the taking his papers from him, was altogether groundless and unjust; that infinite in* stances of the like proceeding might be pro* duced; that no state could be safe without k; and, in short, that.extraordinary cases justify extraordinary methods. That as to the earl of Strafford’s demand, to have duplicates of all the papers that had been laid before the Commons, he thought it unreasonable, and made with no other desigu than to gain time; and make the Commons lose the opportunity of bringing him to his trial: that those papers were so voluminous, consisting of 13 or 14 volumes in folio* that they could not be copied out in many weeks; and as the earl might have had accesi to them, ever since they were laid before the Parliament, so he was still at liberty to peruse them, and extract out of them what he thought proper for his own defence.

The duke of Devonshire and the lord -Cow-, per backed the lord Townshend; and, on the contrary, the lord Harcourt, and the bishop of Rochester, spoke for the earl of Strafford:

The Earl of Hay represented, That, in all civilized nations, all courts of judicature, except the inquisition, allowed the persons arraigned all that was necessary for their justification; and that the House of Peers of Great Britain ought not, in this case, to do any thing contrary to that honour and equity, for which they are so justly renowned through all Europe.

Hereupon it was resolved, that thq earl of. Strafford should have copies of all such papers n« were in the secretary’s, and other offices,

had an express order from the council in writing, his lot dslup was summoned before the council on the llrn of January; and, after he had been examined, his majesty Was pleased to give orders accordingly to lord Townshend and Mr.. Secretary Stanhope, thetwO Secretaries of State, who went immediately to the earl of Strafford’# house, and received from him two trunks, said, by him, to contain what was required. At the same time orders went sent for sealing up his lordship’s papers that were yet on ship-board, or at the custom-boase, coming from Holland.

which he should think proper for his defence; that he should have free access to the papers that had been laid before the Commons; and that a month’s time be allowed him, to answer the Articles of Impeachment against him.

The Earl of Oxforb’s Answer to the Articles of Impeachment against him.] Sept. 3. The House of Lords being informed that Jo-sephTaylor attended, with the Answer of the earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, to the Articles of Impeachment exhibited by the House of Commons against him, he was called in, and presented the said Answer at the bar, sealed up. And, being examined upon oath, touching the same, said he received it from the said earl of Oxford, as his Answer, this morning; and had directions from his lordship to deliver it tp this House as his Answer. And then he withdrew; and the said Answer was read, as follows:

“ The ANSWER of ROBERT Earl of OXFORD and Earl MORTIMER, to the Articles exhibited by the knights, citizens, and burgesses, in Parliament assembled, in the name of themselves and of all the Commons of Great Britain, in maintenance of their Impeachment against him for High Treason, and ocher High Crimes and Misdemeanors supposed t.o have been by him committed.

a The said Earl, saving to himself all advantages of exception to the said Articles, and of not being prejudiced by any words or want of form ia this his Answer; and also saving to himself all rights and privileges belonging to him as one of the peers of this: realm; for answer to the said Articles, saith: he admits, many solemn treaties and alliances have been formerly entered into, between the* crowq of England and other princm and potentates of Europe, for their mutual security, and to prevent the' immoderate growth of the power of France, which might prove dangerous to the neighbouring princes and states; and that therefore it was laid down as a fundamental principle and maxim of union amongst the allies,

* that France and Spain should never come and

* be united under the same government; and ‘ that one and the same person should' not be ‘ king of both these kingdoms and he apprehends, that th« principal view and aim of the allies was, Co settle and maintain an equal balance of power in Europe; and, since the conjunction-of Spain to the dominions of France might possibly ensue from the duke of Anjou’s being possessed of that crown, rile dispossessing him was desired, as the most likely means to prevent that conjunction; and, for the same reason, the union of Spain with the-empire must have been equally fatal, and the prevention of it equally the design of the alliance; nor could; the continuance of Spain in the house of Bourbon be in any respect prejudicial to tl»e allies, if the union of that crown with France could be prevented* As ^ewdangers of such urtion have wets apprehended^ new treaties and stipula-

tions have been entered into among the allies, to obviate such dangers; and particularly the Treaty for an intended Partition seems to have been concluded upon that view. And though he acknowledges the wisdom of Parliament ia condemning that treaty, as prejudicial and fatal in its consequences to England and the peace of Europe; yet, he presumes, it was not condemned because part of the dominions of the crown of Spain were thereby allotted to the house of Bourbon, but because such considerable parts of those dominions as the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, the province of Guiposcoa, and other territories, were allotted to that branch of the house of Bourbon to whom the crown of France was to descend, which might have been a great and dangerous addition ta the then formidable strength of that crown; and because it was made against the repeated remonstrances of Charles the second, then king of Spain, who declared, by his ambassador,

* that such partition treaty could have no other 1 effect, than to force Spaiu to throw itself into

* the arms of France, to prevent the dismember-

* ing of the Spanish monarchy; ’ and that it had this consequence, appeared upon the death of that prince, who seema to have been induced by that consideration to bequeath the entire monarchy of Spain to the duke of Anjou, a younger branen of the house of Bourbon, who accordingly, upon the demise of the said king Charles the second, took possession of the monarchy of Spain; but this accession of the duke of Anjou to the crown ef Spain did not produce the alliance in the article mentioned, between Leopold, then emperor of Germany, his late majesty king William 3, of evergloriou* memory, and the States General, as immediately necessary at that juncture; for king William, as well as the States General, acknowledged the duke of Anjou as king of Spain; thereby allowing, that the duke of Anjou’s enjoyment of the monarchy of Spain, while he was but a younger branch of th? house of Bourbon, was not inconsistent with the liberties of Europe, or the preservation of a due balance of power; and afterwards, when the French king had seized the Spanish Netherlands, king William, by advice of parliament, came in" to the assistance of the States as an auxiliary only, l>y sending upon their request 10,000 men, which England was obliged by treaties to furnish itr case the States were attacked; after which, many conferences passed at the Hague betwixt the ministers of England and the States and those of France, in order to find out some expedient, by which, upon a reasonable division of the dominions of Spain, a new war might be prevented: and the States, in the course of those conferences, often asserted, That

* though they had acknowledged Philip, king ‘ of Spain, yet such an acknowledgment was

* not contrary to the demand of a reasonable ‘ satisfaction to be given to the emperor for

* his pretensions to the Spanish succession ; * which was in effect to declare, That the sa-‘ tisfaction demanded for the emperor was such

159] PARL. HISTORY, « Georg* I. VlS.-Thc Earl of Oxfanf* Ante# (f(to

* as would leave king Philip in possession of Spain.’ But these conferences broke off; about August 1701, without effect; and in September following, king William entered into the grand alliance with the emperor and the States General; whereby it was agreed,

4 That in the first place, endeavours should be used, by amicable means, to obtain the sa-

* tisfaction desired for the emperor; ’ who probably at that time would have accepted a very easy composition for his pretensions. But, when the French king acknowledged the Pretender as king of England (which not long after happened ), his majesty king William and the parliament of England, justlyjprovoked by this affront, resolved to enter into the war, which 1 had been begun by the emperor alone in Italy the year before; and the late queen mentions this indignity as the chief motive of her engaging in it, as appears by her declaration of war against France and Spain, in May 1703. The said Earl admits the several treaties set forth in the preamble to the said articles, and that such advice was given by parliament, and such speeches were made trom the throne, as in the said preamble are mentioned; but, for more certainty, begs leave to refer himself to the very treaties, addresses of parliament, and speeches, when they, shall be produced; and he humbly hopes your lordships will allow him to observe, That those treaties manifestly shew that the design of the allies, in endeavouring the recovery of Spain from the house of Bourbon, was to prevent the union of those two potent kingdoms in one and the same person. In the.grand alliance in 1701, the avowed ends are, 4 the procuring an equitable and reasonable satisfaction to his imperial majesty, for his pretensions to the Spanish succession; the security of the dominions of the king of Great

* Britain and States General, with the navigation and commerce of their subjects; the preventing the union of France and Spain under the

* same government; ’ and tpe territories and provinces pointed out in the fifth article were the farthest views of that alliance: whereby it was thought his imperial majesty would receive the utmost satisfaction which he could reasonably demand for his pretension to the Spanish succession. No . mention is made of the recovery of tke whole monarchy of Spain to the Hquse of Austria, either in the grand alliance or in the defensive one, made the same year, between his majesty king William and- the States General; and when, in the treaty between the emperor, the queen of Great Britain; and the States General on the one part, and the king of Portugal on the other, about May 1703, it was concerted to place archduke Charles, the present emperor, upon the throne of Spain, he was then but a younger branch of the House of Austria; and there is great reason to believe that the queen, as well as other princes of Europe, and in particular the king of Portugal, did not think a treaty to procure the crown of Spain for the arch-duke, when a younger branch tf the House of Austria, did lay any obligation

of procuring that monarchy for him when be became first of that House, and was elected emperor; since the imperial and hereditary dominions, joined to the whole Spanish monarchy, would have given such excess of power to one prince, as would have been formidable to Europe, and a means to destroy that balance of power which her majesty in all her treaties had constantly laboured to preserve: and it is a known and an allowed rule by the law of nations, in reference to leagues between princes, 'That if there happens a material change in what was the .principal ground and cause of the treaty, the obligation thereof ceases. If, therefore, in the preliminary articles in 1709, and afterwards in the conferences at Gertruyden-berg, a cession of the Spanish monarchy to king Charles the third, who was then younger brother to the emperor, was thought reasonable to be insisted on:yet the said earl humbly submits to your lordships great judgment, whether there was equal reason for insisting on such cession, when king Charles the third was become head of that House, and had possession of that Empire and all the hereditary countries of Austria, as a condition without which no peace should be made. The States General were so far from admitting, or yielding, that the monarchy of Spain should in all events be given to the House of Austria; that he the said ear] hath heard they refused to admit it to be inserted as a condition of their Barrier Treaty when proposed by her majesty's ambassador at' the Hague; and" chose rather to put a stop to the proceedings of that treaty, and haaard the advantages they thereby expected, than comply with that proposal. The advice of parliament is of great weight; to which her late majesty always gave, and he the said earl always paid, a just regard: and he doubts not but the House of Peers had proper inducements, When they gave their advice to the throne, 4 That no- peace could be safe, honourable, or lasting,

4 so long as the kingdom of Spain and the West. 4 Indies continued in the possession of any. 4 branch of the House of Bourbon but, if he

may be permitted to offer his humble conjectures of the motives of that advice, he conceiveth it might proceed from an apprehension of a future union of those two orowns, as likely to ensue, in case Spain should continue in the possession of any who might become heir to the crown of France; and that even, the conjunction of the empire and Spain would be lesa dangerous than such an union: but when her

• majesty communicated' jto her parliament, the sixth of June 1712, the terms upon which a peace might be made, and thereby informed . them, 4 That France had been brought to offer, that the duke of Anjou should, for himself and his descendants, renounce for ever all claim to the crown of France; and that, at the same time the succession of the crown of France was to be declared, after the death of the thkn dauphin and bi? sons, to be in the duke of Berry and his sons, in the duke of Orleans and his sons,

• and so on to the rest, of the house of Bourbeu;

PAUL. HISTORY, 2 George I. n\5.~->ta*hc Articles of Impeachment. [162

And that the succession to Spain and the West. Indies, after the duke of Anjou and his children, was to descend to such prince as should he agreed upon at the treaty of peace, for ever excluding the rest of thehouse of Bourbon ;" both Houses of Parliament, by their respective .addresses to her majesty in the same month, expressed their entire satisfaction:And as the House of Commons desired her majesty to

* proceed in the negotiations then depending,

* for obtaining a speedy peace so the House -of Lords assured her majesty, that they entirely relied on her majesty's wisdom, to finish that great and good work. And, after her majesty had concluded a peace on those terms, both ^Houses of Parliament severally congratulated .her majesty on the conclusion of the peace; «nd also joined in an address of the 22d of April -1714, expressing their just Sense of her majesty’s goodness to her people, iu delivering them by a safe, honourable, and advantageous peace with France and Spain, from the heavy burthen of a consuming laud war, unequally carried on and become at last impracticable. He the naid earl acknowledges, that her majesty was pleased, about August 1710, to re-ad m it him, .among others, to a place in her council, and require his services in offices of trust: to which lie submitted, purely in obedience to her majesty's commands, with great reluctance, from •Che prospect of the difficulties with which he eras likely to struggle:But, as he never asked any employment, nor used any wicked arts or base insinuations to obtain the same from her majesty ; so, in dll employments with which her majesty was pleased to honour hjm, he sincerely endeavoured to discharge his duty with Che utmost integrity; having always with the truest zeal desired and endeavoured, as far as be could, to promote the honour and service of her'majesty, whose aim he knew to be the welfare of her kingdoms in the first place, and (a6 far as she judged it consistent with that) the common good of her allies. Iu or about the month of September 1710, her majesty (whose undoubted prerogative it was) thought at to dissolve the Parliament thenjin being, and call a new one. In the year 1711, propositions were made by France to her majesty, for

ace, without the contrivance or previous owledge of the said earl: her majesty, out of her affection for her people, having it much «t her heart to establish peace in her own days, expressed her concern for the disappointment of former negotiations, and her earnest •desire to put a speedy end to the war and to the effusion of Christian blood, and to ease her eutyects from the heavy burthen of their, taxes: The said earl doth acknowledge, that he thought a peace was very much for the interest And advantage of Great Britain; and, in his •humble opinion; the most favourable juncture dor obtaining advantageous terms of peace was •immediately after the signal victories gained by Aar majesty’s arms in the year 1706; for, after •the reduction.of the dominions of the electors I nof(Bavaria and Cologne, with other important VoiuYII.

conquests in Germany; after the entire destruction of three great armies of France, in Flanders, Spain, and Piedmont a after the. allies had recovered the Spanish Netherlands, Milan, and other territories in Italy:it might have been hoped, from the great distress in which the enemy then was, a just and reasonable peace could have been obtained, since so much was at that time gained from the enemy, and so .much more in all probability, would have been yielded by them, as would have fully answered the ends of the grand alliance. Peace was at that time sought by the enemy:And the said earl, who had the honour to be then one of the principal secretaries of state, owns, he then advised the accepting of it; and he humbly begs leave to observe that the war had been continued upon so unequal a foot; that the burden of it annually increased, and at the time when those proposals were made by France was become almost insupportable.. It had indeed been stipulated by the grand alliance,

* that the allies should assist one another with

* all their forces, according to a specification to ‘ be agreed on, in a particular convention for

* that purpose; ' but it doth not appear any such convention was made, otherwise than as the House of Commons were informed by one of the principal .secretaries of state to his late majesty king William, that, by the proportions adjusted with the States, England was to

* furnish two parts of five by land, and, the

* States the other three and England was to furnish five parts of' eight by sea, and the States the other three ; * but the States not always allowing themselves to be under an obligation to furnish such proportions, gave occasion to England's bearing an unequal part in the war, with respect to the allies. The States had that prudent regard to the frugal ordering of their affairs, that they frequently insisted they ought not to be pressed beyond their, ability, and made themselvea the sole'judges of what came within, the compass of it; and by that means avoided the supplying any quota or proportion which they thought Improper for them to furnish. In the mean time the charge of the v^ar was greatly increased upon the subjects of Great Britain. In the year 1703, it was under

4,000,0001; from thence it gradually increased till the year 1706, the charge of which year amounted to above 5, 500,000l.) and still.advancing till the year 1711, it was then gro^vn to near 7,000,000l.; and at the same time there was a debt contracted, not* provided for by parliament, amounting to 7 ot 8,000,000l. the very interest of Vhich, and other debts wherein the nation was involved, amounted to 3,000,000l. per anpum; and the revenues of Great Britain was under such anticipations, that it was found, difficult to raise above 2, 500,000l. fot the growing service, to be paid within the compass of the year; so that, when the duties and difficulties upon trade and the continuance of the taxes upon land (which had lain so heavy above twenty years)

1715. — The Bari of Oxjord^s Answer [164

163] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I.

are considered, the said earl believes it could not be thought for the public interest to prolong the war, without an - absolute necessity. During this time, the States had managed with so good oeconomy, that the said earl hath not heard of any additional duty laid by them upon trade, from the year 1702, to the year 1711; and what acquisitions were made upon the continent, during the continuance of the war, though at the expence of British blood and treasure, accrued to the share of the allies; and the Dutch being under no prohibition of commerce with France, had a further advantage of the British merchants in respect to a free trade. Although the princes of the empire were engaged by previous treaties to furnish their quotas to the common cause; yet, when they were often pressed to do it, they alledged in excuse, ‘ that those troops (which they were obliged to furnish at their own expence) were in the pay of the

* crown of Great Britain :* the emperor left it to her majesty to provide for these troops which by the Portugal treaty in the year 1703, he was to famish; the king of Portugal not only neglected the proportion of 12,000 foot and 3,000 horse, which by the said treaty he was to provide at his own expence, but even refused to permit the 11,000 foot and 2,000 horsa(for which he had subsidy from her majesty) to be paid by musters, according to an article of that treaty;

• and, when pressed to furnish his full number of troops, alledged his inability for want of‘that

art of the subsidies' which the States ought to ave paid him; so that almost the whole charge of the war in Spain was left upon her majesty; the States having sent few or no troops thither after the battle of Almanza, and^ all the other allies being likewise defective in their proportions. This was the condition of affairs with respect to the charge of the war; nor did there appeal *, from the then situation of affairs, any more promising prospect with regard to the event; for although it had pleased God to bless her majesty’s arms with wonderful success, at which the said earl most sincerely rejoiced; yet it did not appear that, after the year 1706, our successes in other parts had countervailed our losses in Spain; for, after two great battles wherein we had heen there defeated, after our forces had been twice obliged to retire from Madrid, and after the taking the British troops at Brihiiega, the recovery of Spain (which was the main article that retarded the conclusion of the peace at Gertruydenberg) seemed almost desperate; especially since the French, in the year 1711, by their plentiful vintages and harvests had well nigh recovered the effects of ttafe famine; and gince some of the allies, at the same time, made pressing instances for recalling part of their troops, as they had done frequently during the course of the war; from |whence it appears, how just the grounds were, upon which both houses of parliament represented to her majesty, ‘ that the war had been unequally carried on, and was at last become impracticable/

And the said earlhurably hopes, he shall not be thought to have designed any dis-service to his country, if, in such a condition of affairs, he did not dissuade her majesty from hearkening to the overtures of peace made to her from France; or if daring the negotiations, he endeavoured, by corresponding, with her majesty's knowledge and approbation, in any courts concerned therein to rectify any mistakes, or contribute in any measure towards the conclusion of a general peace; But the said earl believes, that, in all the negotiation's towards such peace, the allies had such knowledge, and communication of all measures therein taken by her majesty, as the treaties her majesty was engaged in required; that the propositions transmitted from France, about April 1711, were immediately communicated to the Pensionary and ministers of Holland; that her majesty did at the same time assure them of heir resolution to act in concert with them, in making peace as in making war; that when the States had expressed their desires to be equal with those of Great Britain, for a general and lasting peace, and had declartJtT, that they were ready to ‘join in proper measures to procure it, and de-‘ sired France might explain itself more parti-‘ culariy upon the points contained in those ‘ propositions; ' her majesty endeavoured to obtain such explanations, and afterwards communicated them to the States; And, if her majesty thought it not expedient to proceed in the method of a preliminary treaty, which bad proved so ineffectual in the years 1709 and 1710, but thought it might be sufficient upoit articles signed by a minister of France, by his sovereign's command, to open conferences for a peace; the said earl humbly hopes, that this proceeding will appear to be so far from being an unreasonable deviation from the methods of former transactions in that kind, that it will be justified by many precedents of such treaties. The said earl can affirm, that duriag the whole negotiation, so far as he was concerned, he acted with a sincere intention to obtain a general peace for the welfare and honour of her majesty and her kingdoms, and such as might give reasonable satisfaction to her allies, v and answer all the obligations her majesty was, under by any treaties with any of the confederates; and is not conscious to himself that he hath in any respect transgressed that duty, which, " as a privy counsellor or officer of state, he di'd owe to her majesty or to the public. He is not insensible that many of the articles wherewith he stands charged are complicated, with such circumstances, aggravations, and inferences, as may. render it difficult for him to acknowledge some facts alledged, without acknowledging, or seeming at least to acknowledge, those circumstances or inferences: And as he is not conscious to himself of being guilty of any crime he stands charged with; so ha takes it to be agreeable to the common course of proceedings of this nature, and to your lordships'justice, that he should not admit any circumstances which may tend to the eccuta-

165] PAUL. HISTORY, 2 Georgs I. 1715, — Articles of Impeachment.' [H>0

tjon of himself. He therefore begs leave, that he may be allowed to distinguish between the acts .themselves and the inferences drawn from them; and that, wherever he acknowledges any fact, he may not be understood to acknow. ledge those consequences which are in the articles deduced from it, unless it shall appear that the consequence was the aim and design of the •aid earl. Or is the necessary result of any act he hath done.

“ In Answer to the first Article; the said earl saith. That he always had the greatest' regard to the honour and safety of her late ipajesty and her kingdoms, to all the engagements she was under to the allies of this nation, and to the common liberties of Europe; that he never was devoted to the interest or •ervice of the French king; that he is not conscious to (himself of having acted, whilst he had the honour to be. her late majesty’s high treasurer, or one of her most honourable privy council, contrary to his oath, or in violation of his duty and trust, or with disregard to, much les3 defiance of, any treaties in the said article mentioned, the advices of parliament, her majesty’s declarations from the throne, or any mutual assurances which had been made or renewed between her majesty end the States to aGt in perfect concert with each other, in making peace as in making war: And he utterly denies that, in or about the months of July or August 1711, or at any other time, he did form any contrivance or confederacy to set on foot a private, separate, dishonourable, or destructive, negociation of peace, between Great Britain and France; nor doth he know of any such contrivance or confederacy formed by any of her majesty's privy council, or that such negotiation was at any time set on foot. But the said earl saith, he doth believe that, about the month of April 1711, her late majesty did receive from France some proposals, in order to set on foot a treaty for a general peace, signed by M. de Torcy, secretary of state to the most Christian king; which, as he believes, were immediately communicated by her ambassador in Holland to the States-General; whereupon, as he has been informed, they 1 thanked her majesty for her

* confidence in them, declared themselves to be

* weary of the war, and ready' to join in any ‘ measures her majesty should think proper for

* obtaining a good peace; and that they hoped

* her majesty would bring the French to ex-‘ plain more particularly the several points con-< tained in the abovementioned proposals; ’ or^o that effect: And that, after such request, her majesty sent Matthew Prior esquire to the court of France, in order to obtain as full and ample an explanation as he could of the first general offers. But the said earl denies that he did advise her majesty to send the said Mr. Prior to the court of France, to make propositions of peace without communicating the same to her alliesor that the said Mr. Prior did, by his advice or privity, communicate any

propositions to the ministers of France, wherein the interests of Great Britain or, the common interest of Europe were betrayed; nor doth the said earl know that the saiid Mr. Prior had any power to communicate propositions to the ministers of France, which betrayed either the interest of Great Britain, or the common interest of Europe. Therefore the said earl insists, that there is no ground to charge him with the treacherous or pernicious contrivances in thi9 article mentioned:And if any article was inserted in any propositions to he communicated by the said Mr. Prior, ‘ That ‘ the secret should be inviolably kept, till al-

* lowed to be divulged by the mutual consent

* of both parties ; ” yet the said earl denies that such article was inserted by his advice; and if any such there was, he cannot, however, believe it was designed to exclude her majesty’s allies from the just share in the said negociations: And hopes he may .be allowed to observe, that in case any instructions were given for not divulging propositions which concerned Great Britain in particular; the same were far from manifesting such design as is before mentioned; since it is well known to be the undoubted right of every member of a confederacy, to demand particular advantages for themsel ves, not inconsistent with their alliances, and which are not to take place but on the conclusion of a general peace; and it has been usual for those to whom the first overtures of peace are made, to make demands for therti-selves in the first place; as the States particularly did in the negociations at the Hague in the year 1709, and at Gertruydenburg in the year 1710. And though he apprehends that an agreement not to divulge the propositions, without the mutual consent of both parties, could not be to the prejudice of the allies; yet he believes that, iu order to prevent any. unreasonable jealousies among thera, even those propositions which related to Great Britain in particular were communicated to them; and that it will likewise appear, that the propositions signed by Mons. de Torcy, and transmit tedin the month of April 1711, in the said articles mentioned, whereby it is said,

* The French king offered to treat with the

* plenipotentiaries of England and Holland < ‘ alone, or jointly with those of the allies, at ‘ the -choice of England, ’ were proposals relating only to the'manner of treating when the conferences should be opened; and that her majesty was so far from taking upon her to treat singly for the allies, that she chose to have all the parties admitted to the Congress, where they might have an opportunity of treating, and adjusting their respective interests; that being in her opinion the fairest me? thod of proceeding, most advantageous to the confederates, and most likely to prevent jealousies and discords among them. And the said earl saith, That he doth not know that any negociation of peace was contrived or set on foot, by aoy persons employed in her majesty’s service, which was in any respect more

i#7] FARL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 1715. — The Eart of Oxford?* Amtoer [168

advantageous to France than France had asked, or which had the tendency to give the enemy a power to create misunderstandings between her majesty and her allies, dr to destroy the- confidence between them.

“ In Answer to the Second Article; the said earl saitb, That he believes Mons. Mesnager, a subject of the French king, did, some time in the year 1711, with her majesty's leave, come into the kingdom of Great Britain, and bring with him a letter from the said French king to her late majesty, acknowledging her majesty, queen of Great Britain, and likewise expressing a desire to re-establish peace with her; and that he was furnished with full powers from the said French king, for that purpose. The said earl further saith, That if hath been the usual and allowed practice in most nations, especially in England, for privy counsellors, by verbal orders from the sovereign, to confer within the realm with ministers of foreign princes:and he conceives such practice to be agreeable to the laws df this realm; and that full powers are usually granted to ministers who are sent abroad, for the justification of the persons with whom they shall treat, rather than to justify such ministers themselves. And the said earl denies that he did in the month of1 September, 1711, or at any other time, ’secretly and unlawfully, or without authority, confer or treat with the said Sieur Mesnager, on the negociations of peace between Great Britain and France, or that he did advise or promote the making a private and separate treaty or agreement between the said ciowns; but he hath been informed, and doth believe, that there was a paper, styled, The Answer of

* France to the preliminary Demands of Great

* Britain, * more particularly signed by M. Mesnager only; to which was subjoined a declaration of the queen's acceptance of those preliminary articles' as conditions his most

' Christian majesty consented to grant, which were to be reduced into the usual form of treaties, and explained after the most clear and most intelligible manner to the common satisfaction of Great Britain and France, aiid this only in Case of a general peace; and this declaration, or some other declaration to the like effect, he believes might be signed by the lord Dartmouth and Mr. Secretary St. John, as in the said Article is set forth:But the said earl must crave leave to submit it to the judgment of your lordships, whether a paper of that sort (if any such there was) containing offers from France, which were not to, take effect but in case of a general peace, can be called a separate treaty: He believes the allies had early knowledge and participation of the said proposals from the ministers of Great Britain s but denies that the interests of (Great Britain were thereby given up to France, or the duke of Anjou admitted to be king of Spain; since, in the declaration annexed to the said proposals, he v Relieves it is expressed, That her majesty

* might in justice expect the securities* and ad *

< vantages mentioned in those proposals^ what

* prince soever he should be to whom the mo- '

* narchy of Spain should be allotted And the* said earl, Recollecting as well as he can what were her majesty's views at thrit time, is persuaded, that her majesty bad then a prospect' that the monarchy of Spain would fell to the-1 share of another prince. The said earl denies' that, by his privity, consent, or advice, any pri4* vate or separate treaty or agreement, whereby the interests of Great Britain were given up to France, or the duke of Anjou was admitted to be king of Spain, was agreed, concluded, or signed, by the said Sieur Mesnager on the part of France, and by the lord Dartmouth and* Henry St. John, or either of them, in behalf of her late majesty; much less did the stthr earl at any time assume to himself regal power, * or rake upon him to meet and treat with; the enemy without authority from her majesty, or do any thing to subvert the an-tient and established constitution of the government of these kingdoms, or intro* duce any illegal or dangerous methods of transacting the affairs of state. And the said earl further saith, That he did never aim at or endeavour, by any separate treaty, to dissolve or cancel any of those solemn treaties in which h^r majesty stood engaged to her allies; nor was lie privy to any treaty whereby the queetf was brought under a dilemma, either to submit to the dictates of France in the progress of such negotiation, or to lose the confidence of her allies.

“ Iif Answer to the Third Article, * the said Earl denies that, to disguise or carry on any private, separate, or dangerous negotiations, he did contrive dr advise the preparing and forming the set of general preliminaries in the article mentioned, intituled, 1 Preliminary Arti *

‘ cles on the part of France, to coma to a ge-

* neral peace, ” or any other set of general preliminaries of like nature, or, that the same should be signed by the Sieur Mesnager; or that he did advise her sacred majesty, that the same should be received by her majesty: But the said earl hath been informed, that certain articles, called, Preliminary Articles on the

* part of France, to come to a general peace, * signed by the Sieur Mesnager only, were received by her majesty; and believes the same might be communicated to the ministers of the allies then residing in England, as a ground whereon the confederates might treat or negotiate concerning a general peace; but whether the same were communicated as the only transactions that had been on that subject between Great Britain and France, the said earl knows not:But, since it is termed impious advice, and contrary to the duty and trust of a minister of state of Great Britain, to advise thft receiving such articles, the said earl, from his concern for the honour of her late majesty’s administration, and the future welfare df these kingdoms, doth submit, whether it is 'criminal

KJ91 PARL. HISTORY, 2 Geo*g* I. 1715. — ArticlU of lnxptachment* [170

' for such minister to advise the receiving articles from a minister of a prince in war, containing proposals for giving reasonable Satisfaction ro Great Britain and all her allies, and Which, being signed by the, minister of that prince only, were not intended to bind any other: And since preliminary articles are no essential step towards a general negotiation, there being, as he believes, but few instances where any matters of importance have been settled before the opening of general conferences, the said carl doth not conceive that, if any minister of state had advised her majesty to accept the preliminaries or offers from France, said to be signed by M. Mesnager, the 27ih day of September 1711, as the foundation of a treaty, he had thereby offended against any known law; since the proceedings upon such preliminaries-could not be more unsafe than proceeding without any at all. The said earl denies that any treaty, signed by the earl of Dartmouth or Mr. St. John, or either of them, on the part of England, and the Sieur Mesnager on the part of France (if any such there be ), was industriously concealed from the allies, her majesty's council or parliament, by his advice or contrivance; or that he dissuaded her majesty from laying any such treaty before her allies, her council, or parliament; or that he advised, her majesty to receive the said general preliminaries, or to communicate the same in her name, or by her authority, to the States General, as a sufficient foundation whereon to open the conferences of peace with France, The said earl hath been informed, and doth believe, that there were certain instructions prepared and signed by her majesty, and delivered to the earl of Strafford, her majesty’s ambassador to the States General, wherein the said ambassador might be directed to represent to the Pensionary of Holland, and such others as should be appointed to confer with him, in such manner as is set forth in this article, or to the like effect: But he denies that the said instructions were prepared, signed, or delivered, by his advice. Nevertheless, the said earl believes the said instructions were well warranted by the truth of such facts as in the said article are set forth to be contained in those instructions; since the said earl hath had credible information, that, after her majesty had received an account of the sense of some persons in Holland, concerning the overtures made by France for the setting a general negotiation of peace on foot, very pressing instances were made on her majesty’s behalf with the enemy, to explain the first offers made by M. de Torcy more particularly, and to form a distinct project of such a peace as they were willing to conclude; and that such instances had effect, will appear from the preliminaries, «*id to be signed by M. Mesnager, September JWth 1711, wherein several explications are made, and many particulars of moment are Contained, which wer£ not in the propositions •f M. de Torcy. Wherefore the said earl ap-prtbends, that the propositions said in this ar-

ticle to be sent over to France (if any such were sent) were not so general as the propositions of M. de Torcy, nor in any respect ensnaring or

destructive to the interests of Great Britain or the allies; but yet the said earl believes, that her majesty, at the same time she did communicate the stud preliminaries to the States General, did likewise order her ambassador to acquaint them, That she judged those articles ‘ did not contain such particular concessions as

* France would be probably obliged to make in

* the course of the negotiations ; * or to that effect. If therefore her majesty did, for the good and ease of her people, endeavour to prevail with her allies to enter into a negotiation of peace, and did communicate the said preliminaries to them with that view; the said earl cannot be induced to believe, that the said general preliminaries, communicated to the States by her majesty in manner aforesaid, were calculated to amuse and deceive them; nor doth the said earl know, or believe, that her majesty’s instructions to her said ambassador, either in the particulars abovesaid or in any other, contained matters false, prevaricating, or evasive: and the said eaVl must take the liberty to affirm, that in the late negotiations of peace, as well as in all other public transactions of state, as far as he was concerned, be acted with the highest regard to the honour of her majesty, and with the utmost zeal, for the welfare both of her and her people; and is not conscious to himself, that he ever gave any counsels whereby the, truth and sacredness, which ought to constitute and accompany the instructions of public ambassadors to princes in friendship and confederacy against the common enemy, were in any wise prostituted, or the honour of her majesty and of the imperial crown of these realms in any sort debased or betrayed. And he humbly hopes no instance can be given, wherein the royal hand of her late majesty was made the instrument to advance the interest of the common enemy,

“ In Answer to the Fourth Article; the said Earl doth not remember what representations were made by Monsieur Buys to her majesty, in relation to the propositions in the said article mentioned. But saith, that if any representations were made, the same were not rendered ineffectual by any influence of the said earl. And the said earl doth admit, that, at a committee of council, there might be made some declaration in her majesty’s name to M. Buys, to the effect in the said article mentioned; but doth not admit, that any such declaration was made by him the said earl, or by his management or contrivance; and the said earl believes, that what was so declared to the said M. Buys was agreeable to truth, and to the real sentiments and intentions of her majesty; nor doth he know, wherein the said article, signed by M. Mesnager, and accepted by the ford Dartmouth and Mr. St. John (if any such were then signed) were inconsistent with such declaration, or how her majesty was thereby

mi PARL. HISTORY, 2G*0ftCEl, ni5.~.Thc Earl of Oxford's Answer [17 *

dishonoured, or her allies abused; or that any negotiation entered into with France was either dangerous in itself or fatal in its consequences.

“ In Answer to the Fifth Article; the said Earl admits, that her sacred majesty queen Anne did, in due form of law, and under her great seal, constitute the right reverend John lord bishop of Bristol add the earl of Strafford, her plenipotentiaries, with full powers, to meet, treat, and conclude, with the plenipo- tiaries of the confederates and those whom the French king should on his part depute for that purpose, the conditions of a good and general peace, that should be safe, honourable, and, as far as was possible, agreeable to the reasonable demands of ail parties; and believes instructions were prepared and delivered to them, wherein they were instructed, among other things, to the effect in the said article set forth; and is firmly persuaded, that, when t)ie said plenipotentiaries were so instructed to insist that Spain and the West Indies should not be allotted to the house of Bourbon, no treaty had been negotiated and agreed, that Spain and the West Indies should remain in a branch of that bouse; and he has reason to believe, that at the time when the said instructions were given to her majesty’s said plenipotentiaries, there was just ground to believe that king Philip would be induced to abandon Spain and the West Indies, and content himself with the dominions of Savoy and the kingdom of Sicily; and he believes he may so far depend on his memory as to say,

* That he heard the late queen declare, she

* believed the prospect king Philip had of

* succeeding to the crown of France, would be an inducement to him to be easy with that

* allotmentand it seemed probable, that the addition of the dominions of Savoy to the crown of France, in case king Philip should succeed to it, would be esteemed by the French court as a thing more to be desired by them, than, that Spain and the Indies should remain in the possession of a younger prince of the house of Bourbon, under the condition of his.renouncing the right he would have to the crown of France if the eldest branch should fail. These seem to him to have been her majesty’s views at the time when the said instructions were given to the bishop of Bristol and the earl of Strafford: and he therefore believes] that) whoever contrived or prepared the same, did prepare them conformable to her majesty’s real sentiments, and was far from any thought or design to abuse the royal authority, delude the States General, prejudice his imperial majesty or any of the allies, or carry on the measures of France. And if king Philip afterwards, upon information that the then Dauphin was likely to live, or at the pressing instances of the Spaniards and influence of Spanish councils, or upon any other motives, refused to accept of Savoy ana Sicily, and chose rather to renounce the French monarchy; bethinks no

person who acts in the service of the crown can be safe, if it may be charged on him as a crime, that be advised instructions, which, by intervening circumstances, afterwards became improper: but he the said earl doth not admit that he contrived or prepared the said instructions, or was consenting or advising to the contriving or preparing of them, or prevailed on her majesty to sign them; much less that he abused the royal authority to the delusion of the States General, or intended the prejudice of his' imperial majesty or any of the allies, or was engaged to carry pjn the measures of France, of had", when the said instructions were prepared, negotiated or agreed with the ministers of France, that Spain and the West Indies should remain in a branch of the House of Bourbon, or had prevailed on her majesty Jo be party to any private treaty wherein the same is necessarily implied. If the plenipotentiaries were instructed, 1 That

* in case the enemy should object, that the ‘ second article of the seven signed by mon-

* sieur Mesnager implied the duke of Anjou

* should continue; on the throne of Spain, to

* insist that those articles were binding to *Frunce, but laid neither the queen nor her allies under any obligation; ’ the said earl

doth not apprehend how an instruction to her majesty’s plenipotentiaries, to make a just answer to a false inference that might happen to be drawn, by the enemy from the words of such an article, can be interpreted an entering into a confederacy or collusion with the ministers of the enemy; or that her majesty’s consent to such instructions could imply any design to impose on his imperial majesty or the allies, or to conceal any negotiations between Great Britain and France. But the said earl is confident it will not appear, by any of his actions, oh the strictest scrutiny, that he ever entered into any confederacy or collusion with the ministers, of the enemy, or prevailed on the queen to give her consent thereto, or had any designs to impose upon his imperial majesty or any of the allies, or ever was privy to any secret negotiations or separate treaty between Great Britain and France, whereby, either in the beipre-mentioned or in any other particulars, any reproach could be brought on the crown of these realms, or any treaties wherein her majesty was engaged to her allies were violated.

“ In Answer to the Sixth Article; the said Earl doth admit, that after the conferences of peace between the plenipotentiaries of the allies and those of the enemy for negotiating a general peace were opened, wherein he is persuaded her majesty and her ministers did' act in perfect confidence with the allies, in order to promote their common interest, and to obtain from the enemy all just and reason^ able satisfaction, the progress of the said negotiation was delayed by debates concerning tbs enemies refusal to give their answer in writing to the demands of the allies; bnt be doth not

know that any of the ministers of Great Britain did, by any encouragement or concurrence, contribute thereunto. And if during that time her majesty thought fit to authorize any of her ministers to write or negotiate upon any particular points relating to the peace, directly from England to France, in order to facilitate the general negotiation of peace, which he the said earl doth not admit to have been done by his privity:yet he the said earl doth not apprehend, that, by the constitution of the kingdom or any law in being, the cfUeen was debarred from doing so; or that, by constituting the said plenipotentiaries, she had so far delegated to them her royal authority, as to be disabled, without revoking their commission, to treat or negotiate any matters conducing to that end, in such other manner as she should think fit. The said earl saith, That he did not advise, contrive er promote, any private, separate, or unjustifiable negotiation with France; nor doth be know any negotiation relating to the peace was carried on'without communication .thereof to the allies. And the said earl'denies that he ever assumed regal authority; /or that he' treated of peace with France in apy manner that could be liable to such imputation; or did promote the design of the enemy, to the destruction of the common cause Cf her majesty or of her allies, contrary to the laws or constitution of this kingdom, or in violation of any of the alliances her majesty stood engaged in, or of the assurances given by her majesty, or of her instructions to her plenipotentiaries; or that any terms of peace were by him at any time concerted, prejudicial to the interest of her majesty, or her kingdoms or allies, or whereby the good effects of the general negotiation were defeated.

“ In Answer to the Seventh Article the said Earl saitb, That he never advised heriate majesty to accept of a treaty with France, on a supposition that the Spanish monarchy should continue in the possession of a *branch of the house of Bourbon; nor did he advise or carry on any private or separate negociation with France, on the subject of a renunciation to be made by. the duke of Anjou of the right he might have to the kingdom of France, and that such renunciation should be the security against the re-union of the two kingdoms; or that by his counsels her majesty was prevailed on to accept, and finally to conclude' and ratify, a treaty of peace with Frabce, wherein the said renunciation is taken as a sufficient expedient to prevent the mischiefs that threatened all Europe, in case the crowns of France and Spain should be united upon the head of one and the same person; nor doth he know that, during the said negociation, any such memorial asHn the said article is set forth, was transmitted by the said monsieur de Torcy to any of hei; majesty’s principal secretaries of state s but he the said earl doth freely acknowledge, that, if he had been called upon to give his opinion

concerning the leaving of Spain and the West Indies in the possession of a branch of the bouse of Bourbon, and accepting the renunciation of his right to the kingdom of. France by the duke of Anjou; he doth not at present seer any reason why he might not havj been of opinion for leaving Spain and the West Indies to the present possessor, and accepting the renunciation, rather than have continued the war, so burthensome to the people, and impracticable upon the foot on which it then stood; especially since all endeavours to remove him by treaties or force had so long proved ineffectual:and in case any such memorial as is set forth io the said article was sent by any minister of France to the secretary of the late queen, he should look upon, the same a» a proof of the earnestness of the court of France to avoid such renunciation, which might more effectually prevent all possibility of annexing the crown of Spain to that 6f France. But, whatever inducements might be for such a memorial (if any such was transmitted ), the said earl doth affirm, that he never gave any counsels, by which the interest of the common cause, could be betrayed into the bands of the enemy; nor doth he think It was possible, by any pow.er and influence, to engage her majesty to become party with France in ^ny deceit; but whatever credit he at any time had by her favour, he always used it, with the utmost sincerity, for her service and the good of her people.”

“In Answer to the Eighth Article; the said Earl believes that her late majesty queen Anne did, on the 7th day of December in the year of our Lord 1711, recommend it from the throne, “ That provision might he made for an early campaign, in order to carry on the war with vigour, and as the best way to render the treaty of peace effectual'; and he doth believe that, in order thereto, supplies vyere granted, and magazines provided at a great expence, for an early campaign; and that in pursuance thereof, her majesty might send some general officers to explain her intentions .to her allies; and likewise instructed her general the duke of Ormond to declare her resolutions of carrying on the war, and to cpncert with the generals of the allies the proper measures for entering upon action: and he doth believe that the confederate army was provided with all necessaries; but whether the said array had approached, or how near they had approached, to {he enemy; whether Jhey had any, or what superiority as to the number of troops; or what likelihood there was that they would have been able, either by battle or siege, to have bettered the affairs of the allies, or to have facilitated the negociations of peace, the said earl is not able to say:but it miist be obvious to every one, that any miscarriage or disaster on the part of the allies, at such a juncture, must have been fatal to them; and though the divine assistance had been very remarkable in the many victories her majesty's forces had obtained, yet her majesty’s. piety vyas so great, that it is not likely

175] PARL. HISTORY, 2<3*<mGeX m Earl^f OxJbr^B Anpocr (\70

she should, without the greatest necessity, have been -willing to have tempted that Providence which had been so signal in her favour, by hazarding the blood of her Objects, at a time when she had so near a prospect of the conclusion of a peace: and the said earl believes it might be owing to this piety of the queen, and her knowledge of some important matters then depending, that directions were sent to the duke of Ormond (if any such were sent) to avoid engaging in any siege, or hazarding any battle, till further orders; which he supposeth her majesty might do upon any causes she thought proper, as well as the deputies of the States; who as the said earl hath been informed, have often refused to engage in siege or battle bpon such groond as tltey alone thought fit, when their own generals and the generals of the other allies were of opinion they had a visible, advantage of the enemy, and might engage in such siege or battle with great probability of success. But he doth affirm, that the ministers of France never represented to him, or to any others as far as he knows, during any , negociation, any apprehensions they had from the bravery and good disposition of the confederate army ; nor was be ever informed of any sure prospect, which, it isalledged the army of the confederates then had, ofgaining new conquests over the army of France, or whereby they would have been enabled to have forced any better terms of peace than there was at that time likelihood of, but, on the contrary, he has been informed, that the forces of France were superior in number to those of the confederates, especially in horse. However, the said earl doth not admit that he did advise or consent that any order should be dispatched in her majesty's name to the duke of Ormond to the aforementioned effect; nor had he any view or 'design to disappoint the expectations of the •hies, or to give success to any secret negotiations with the ministers of France: The said 'earl likewise denies that he did consent or advise that orders should be sent to the bishop of Bristol, one of her majesty’s plenipotentiaries ' then at Utrecht, to declare to the Dutch ministers, That her majesty 1 looked on herself,

* from their conduct, to be then under no ob-

* ligation whatsoever to them/ He doth not know what alarm the allies might take, or what representations they' made to the bishop of Bristol of their dissatisfaction or consternation; but doubts not the said bishop would readily represent what they desired, though such representation made by his lordship, if any such there was, fell not under the knowledge of the •aid earl; nor doth he admit that any application of that kind wns made to him: And in case the States General mode such address directly to her majesty, by a letter of the 5th day of June, as in the said article is set forth; 'be the said earl, not being acquainted therewith, could neither advise her majesty to hearken to the instances therein made, nor to disregard or reject the same. He saitb, he •ever entered into mensures for the advance-

ment of the interest of the common enemy; or countenanced, encouraged, advised, of promoter ), any negotiations with France, without participation of the allies, or contrary to ber majesty's engagement, or to the ruin of the . common cause; nor is Ire conscious to himself that he ever gave any counsels, by which the progress of tire victorious arms of the confederates was stopped, or any opportunity lost for conquering the enemy, or .which had any tendency to destroy the confidence between her majesty and her allies, or make the French' king master of the negotiations of peace; or which could put the affairs of Europe into Iris hands.

In Answer to the Ninth Article; the said Earl denies he was privy or consenting to any concert with the ministers of France, for the separating the Uuops in her majesty’s .pay from the rest of the confederate army.: and, not being privy to any such concert, he hopes it will uot be imputed to him as any want of duty, ' that he did not advise against such a proceeding. He denies also that he ever entertained the least design of imposing upon the allies any necessity of submitting to the terms of France, or of leaving the confederate army to the mercy of the enemy:or that he did consent, or advise her majesty, that the duke of Ormond and the troops in her majesty’s pay, or such of them a$ would obey his orders should separate themselves from the army of the confederates. The said earl hath been informed, and believes it to be true, that the imperial general and some other generals did propose to the duke of Ormond, in June or July in the year 1712, to decamp from the ground where they lay, and to proceed towards Landrecy, in order to form the siege of that place: and that the duke of Ormond thought it not proper to consent thereto, and gave notice to the said generals, that, if they ‘ decamped, they must not expect him to follow them/ And the said earl believes instances may be given, where generals of other potentates in the alliance have refused to comply with what has been proposed to them by her late majesty’s general.- The said earl hath likewise heard, that notwithstanding such notice from the duke of Ormond, the said generals separated themselves and their forces from the said duke, and marched towards Laa-drecy without him; and that the said duke continued for some time in his former camp after such separation; and that the generals of the auxiliary troops paid by her majesty, although required by the said duke of Ormond under whose command they then were, -to continue with him and to obey his orders, refused so to do. He the said earl supposes it might proceed from her majesty’s resentment of that instance of disobedience in the auxiliary troops to the commands of her general, that she did not think-fit immediately to pay the arrears of those forces which had so obstinately withdrawn themselves from her general, and marched

177] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George Ik 1715. — to, the Articles of Impeachment. [17S

without him towards Landrecy; as hot apprehending herself obliged by any coaventions, or the provision of any act of parliament, so to do. But, whatever might be the causes or occasions of her majesty's resentment, the said earl saith, that be, being in the office of high treasurer under her majesty, could not by the duty of his place, issue out any monies without 'a proper warrant or authority from her majesty:and denies that he ever received any warrant or authority from her majesty for issuing any sum or sums of money, for or towards the pay or subsidies on account of the said foreign troops who had so separated; without which, the issuing or directing any monies for the payment of them had beeu a violation of his duty. And the said earl denies that he did at any time refuse or put a stop to any such pay or subsidies; but, on the contrary, when the ministers of the princes, to whom those forces belonged, did apply for the payment of the said troops, the said earl desired them to make application to her majesty for the necessary warrants, in order thereunto. And as the said earl had no notice of any separation intended between her majesty's forces and those of the allies before the same was made; so he absolutely dentes that, by his advice or counsel, or with his privity, any such separation was made; and humbly apprehends, that he ought not injustice to be charged with any consequences of it. He believes that the forces of some of the allies were engaged in the unfortunate action of Denain; and that the siege of Laodrecy was raised, and the towns ofQuesnoy, Bouohain, and Do way, were some time after re-taken by the French army. But whether those disasters might not have been prevented by a compliance with the measures her majesty had taken for the common good, the said earl submits to your lordships.

u In Answer to (he Tenth Article; the said Earl denies that he did carry on or concert with the ministers of France a private or separate negotiation for a general suspension by sea and laud between Great Britain and France; or that he did advise her majesty to send over Henry viscouqt Bolingbroke to the court of France, with powers to settle such suspension; but hath been informed, and believes it may be true, that, about the 19th of August, N. S. 1712, a suspension of arms was agreed on in France, by the said viscount Bolingbroke on her majesty’s part, for four months, : but whether such agreement was made without the knowledge or participation of her majesty's allies, or how far the terms of peace were then settle! with France, either for Great Britain or the allies, the said earl is not able to set forth; but, from the informations he hath received of that affair, believes it will appear that the said suspension was a continuation only of a former agreement for a cessation of arms, which Had been not only communicated to the allies, but into which they had been invited: and believes her majesty might be induced to desire such

VOL.VII.

cessation, as’what was usual amongst princes and states in war, during negotiations of peace, by which means the British merchants enjoyed a free trade, and had an opportunity of carrying' the merchandizes of other countries to several parts of Europe, as the Dutch had done, during the war:And therefore the said earl doth not conceive that her majesty, by the said suspension, did in the least intend the violation of any treaties between her and her allies, or to deprive them of any assistance to which they were entitled, or expose them to the insults of the common enemy; nor doth he discern how these consequences could ecsue, without the default of the allies themselves; much less how the ties of union and friendship between her majesty and them were cut asunder, of her majesty's person or government, or the safety of her kingdoms, or the protestant succession, were exposed thereby: but the said earl assures himself, that he shall never stand chargeable with any consequences of such suspension, which he never advised; nor did he the said earl ever entertain the least thought or design of occasioning the destruction of the common cmise of Europe, or hindering her majesty from resuming the war against France in conjunction with her allies, if it had been so thought fit or of weakening the union between her majesty and them..

u In Answer to the Eleventh Article; the said Earl saith, he believes it to be true, that, in or about the months of September or October 1712, the States General were in possession of the town and fortress of Tournay:and that her majesty, in her instructions of December 23, 1711, to her plenipotentiaries at Utrecht, did direct them to insist with the plenipotentiaries of France, in the general Congress, That

* towards forming a barrier for the States Ge-

* neral, Tournay should remain to the States and doth believe the French king did atodfc time incline thereunto; but doth not know that her majesty, in her speech in the Said article mentioned, did declare herself as in the said article is set forth. The said earl ad-, mits that, until and after the months of September and October 1711, there was open war between, her late majesty and the French king, and that during such war the French king and his subjects were enemies to the late queen i but the said earl hath been informed, and believes, that full powers were given by her majesty and the States General of the United Provinces to their respective ministers, and by the French king to his ministers, to negotiate and treat of peace between her majesty and the States General and the' said French king, upon which negotiations a peace was afterwards concluded between them; during which negotiations, he hath heard that the French'king did insist upon the

ielding up' the town and fortress of Tournay,

y the States to him; and the said States General desired her majesty's interposition with the French king on their behalf; 'and N

179] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 1715. — of Oxford’s Answer [180

that, at such request, her majesty interposed her best offices on behalf of the States General; and did at last prevail, that the said town and fortress of Tournay should be (and he believes the same is) continued to the States General, as parti of their barrier. But the said earl absolutely denies that he did design to give aid or succour, or to adhere to the French king; or that he did in or about the month of October 1712, or at any other time during the said war, aid, help, or assist, or adhere to the said French king; or that he did ever counsel or advise the said enemy, in what manner, or by what methods the said town and fortress of Tournay, or either of then ), might be gained from the States General to the French king, in manner and form as in the said article is charged: On the contrary, he the said earl did use his best offices to preserve the said town and fortress of Tournay to the States General. But the said earl saith, that, during the negotiations of tike late

Seace, he had the honour to be one of her said ite majesty’s privy council:and whatever counsel or advice he gave relating to any terms of the said peace, he acted therein as a privy, counsellor and minister of state, and no otherwise; and doth insist, that for any privy counsellor, or minister of state, during the negotiations of peace, to advise or negotiate concerning the yielding or giving up any town, province, or dominion, upon the conclusion of the peace, as part of the terms and conditions of such peace, is not high treason by any law of this realm; and that such construction might hereafter deprive - the crown of the advice and assistance of several members of the privy Council in matters of the greatest importance, by deterring them from giving such advice as by their oaths and the duty of their place they are obliged to do; would overthrow all means of restoring amity between princes, and render law in case of high treason uncertain (which by reason of its being the most penal, ought to be most plain); and would be highly dangerous and destructive to the lives and liberties of the subject.

‘‘In Answer to the Twelfth Article; the said Earl, not admitting that her late majesty queen Anne stood engaged by treaties in manner as in the said article i3 alledged; but referring himself to the treaties when they shall be produced; for answer, denies that he did in any of the years 1710, 1711, and 1712, or at any other time, ' aid, help, assist, or adhere to, the duke of Anjou in the said article named; or advise or counsel any of the enemips of her said late majesty, or concert with any of them, or promote the yielding or giving up Spain and the West Indies, or any part thereof, to the said duke of Anjou, in manner and form as in the said article is alledged. And the said ear] saith, as in his answer to the eleventh Article he hath already said, that during the negotiations of the late peace; he had the honour to be one of

ber said late majesty’s privy council; and whatever counsel or advice he gave relating to any terms of the said peace, he acted therein as a privy counsellor and minister of state, and no otherwise; and insists as in his answer to the eleventh Article he has insisted.

“ In Answer to the Thirteenth Article; the Said Earl admits, that the flourishing condition of trade and navigation contributes much to the riches, power, and strength, of these kingdoms; and believes that her latejnajesty had a just regard thereto, and a sincere desire to obtain some advantages therein for her people; and did make the several declarations from tho throne, set forth in this Article:and that both houses of parliament did from time to time express their grateful acknowledgements to her majesty, for the great care and concern for the welfare of her people; and believes her majesty might think it reasonable, considering the share and burden she and her people had sustained in the war, that France should in the first place adjust the interests of Great Britain, which were to be secured on the conclusion of a general peace; but the said earl doth not know, or believe, that, at the setting on foot, or in the progress of, any negociation between the ministers of Great Britain and France, it was laid down as a principle, that France should in the first place consent to adjust the interests of Great Britain, to the intent that the ministers of Great Britain might thereby be enabled to engage the queen ta make the conclusion of the peace easy to France; nor doth he know that any concessions were made by the ministers of Great Britain with intent to promote the interests of France against the allies; or that any measures were entered into or concerted between them, in order to strengthen the hands of the French, or to enable them to impose the terms of a general peace: and the said earl doth absolutely deny that he was engaged in concert with France, in any negotiation destructive to his country; or that he ever had the least imagination or thought tending that way, or to the sacrificing the commerce of Great Britain to the aggrandizement of France; but, on the contrary, be hath always had the most real and sincere desires to secure and advance the commerce of Great Britain, and to preserve his country; in whose service he hath been always ready to sacrifice himself and every private interest whatsoever. And the said earl is not conscious to himself of any want of duty, either in not insisting upon, or not procuring, the most certain securities that could be obtained, for the safety and advantage of the commerce of these kingdoms: and the said earl doth not admit, that he did advise her late majesty that any proposition *, should be sent by Mr. Prior to France; ow that any private or separate treaty, or, tho preliminary articles, which are said to be signed the 27th day of September 1711, should be signed: but the said, earl hath been ia-

181] TARL. HISTORY, 2 George I.. 17 i 5. — to Articles of Impeachment. [IS

formed and believes, that in a paper, in titled,

* The Answer of France to the demands of

* Great Britain more particularly, ' it is said,

* .That the' entire restitution of Newfoundland

* and of the Bay and Streights of Hudson

* was demanded for the Englishand that the French king's answer was, '< That the dis-

* cussion of that article should be referred to ‘ the general conferences of the peace; pro-

* vided the liberty of fishing and drying of

* codfish upon the Isle of Newfoundland should

* be reserved to the French:' and the said earl conceives that paper not conclusive; but was to be the subject of future conferences, wherein the whole matter might be entirely considered; and consequently, that the entering into conferences on that paper, was not the yielding to the French liberty of fishing and drying fish on Newfoundland, which they insisted on: and the said earl' denies that he advised the demands of Great Britain, in point of commerce, should be made in loose, general or insufficient terms; or that he advised the liberties insisted on by the French should be given up to France, as in the said article is alledged: and he believes, that when it is considered what advantages were likely to

i ensue to the commerce of Great Britain, by the Assiento contract and the liberty of trading to the Spanish West Indies, by the cession of Accadia, the Bay and Streights of Hudson, the Island of St. Christopher, Newfoundland, the Island of St. Peter, with, other adjacent islands, by the demolition of Dunkirk, and the cession of Port Mahons and Gibraltar, it will not be thought the commerce of Great Britain was neglected by her majesty‘in the late treaties of peace; and as the said earl doth' not know that France was at any time master of the negotiations; so he denies that he did engage her majesty in any private treaties with France without security for the commerce of Great Britain; or that he did contrive, with any of the ministers of France, to keep in suspense airy matters that concerned the said commerce; or that he was any ways instrumental to the preventing any advantages of the said commerce from being settled; or .that he endeavoured to elude any- thing that had been agreed on in any negotiations for the benefit of Great Britain. And although the said’earl doth not admit that he advised the ninth article of the treaty of commerce with France; yet he begs leave to observe, that nothing is positively stipulated in that article; but the . whole is conditional, and left to be deter-, mined by the wisdom of parliament: and .hopes it will never be thought an act of treachery* to refer any article of any treaty to. the judgment and consideration of parliament, whateverjudginentthe parliament shall think, fit to make thereon. And the said earl denies that he advised her majesty to agree with France, that the subjects of France should have the liberty of fishing and drying fish on Newfoundland; but the said earl believes, that what her late majesty agreed with France

, relating thereto will npt1 seem unreasonable, if it be considered that the French long ago claimed' a right to, and were in possession of, great part of Newfoundland; and that they were allowed to continue in possession thereof by the crown of England, in a treaty made at Whitehall, in the year 1686, and an another treaty made at Ryswick in the year 1697: and the said earl doth not kn, ow that such agrees ment of her majesty is contrary to the express provision, of any act of parliament; since, , hq presumes, the act made in the 10th and 11th years of the reign of king William the Third, intitled, ‘ An Act to encourage the Trade of 1 Newfoundland, ' cannot reasonably be intended or construed to extend to any part of the island, other than what was at the time of making that act in the possession of the English; and the said earl is informed, that at that time the part of Newfoundland, where the subjects of France are, by the treaty of Utrecht, allowed the liberty of fishing and drying fish, was not in the possession of tb<p English. The said earl denies that he advised her majesty to make a cession to France of the ' Isle of Cape Breton; or that he advised her majesty to consent that what is agreed in the treaty of Utrecht concerning the fishery of Newfoundland or Cape Breton should be made an article in that treaty: however, the said earl doth not know that Cape Breton was part of the territories of the crown of, Great Britain; nor doth he apprehend that her majesty, who, in her speech from the throne, declared, ‘ That France had consented to make ‘ an absolute cession of Annapolis, with the ‘ rest of Nova Scotia or Accadie, ’ should be understood to speak of Gape Breton, which is no part of that continent* but an island distinct from it. The said eapl further saith, he conceives that the only advantages in trade stipulated for Great Britain did not depend on conditions to be made good by act of parliament; on the contrary, he doubts uot to make it appear, that many advantages in trade were stipulated for Great Britain in the late treaties of peace and commerce, which have been enjoyed by the subjects of Great Britain since the conclusion of the said treaties, notwithstanding the parliament has not thought fit to make any act to enforce the ninth article of the treaty of c^romerpe with France; and the said earl denies that by his counsel the good intentions of her sacred majesty to have obtained forherpeople advantageous terms of commerce were frustrated, or the trade or manufactures of Great Britain rendered precarious or at the mercy of the enemy, or any beneficial branch, of trade yielded up to the subjects of France. And as the said earl disowns the being concerned in any violation of treaties, or in carrying on the measures of France, or in any negotiation which could terminate in the sacrifice of the commerce of Great Britain to France; so he observes with great satisfaction the flourishing condition of the trade and navigation of these kingdoms, since the conclusion

and by means of the kite peace, in die great increase of the number and tonnage of shipping, of the exportation of the woollen manufactures, thd fish, and other .produce of this kingdom; in consequence whereof, the customs have been greatly advanced, near three millions of gold and silver tiath been coined, and the exchange has been all along in favour of England to and from all parts of Europe.

u In Answer to the Fourteenth Article; the said earl doth not admit that he formed any roject or design for disposing the kingdom of icily to the duke of Savoy from the House of Austria; or that he did advise her majesty to give any such instructions to Henry viscount Bolingbroke as in the said article mentioned, or to consent to any treaty wherein a cession is made of the said kingdom to his royal highness, without any concurrence or participation of his imperial majesty: nor doth he admit that^her majesty was prevailed on by his advice to assist his said royal highness with her fleet against the emperor, in order to obtain the possession of that kingdom; but, iu justification of her majesty’s proceedings in relation .to the said kingdom, the said earl doth beg leave to observe, that, by the grand alliance it was agreed, among other things, ‘ That the confe-‘ derates should use their utmost endeavours ‘ to recover the kingdom of Sicily out of the hands of the enemy and that the principal ends for the endeavouring the recovery of Sicily were, That his imperial majesty ‘ might have a reasonable satisfaction for his ‘ pretension to the Spauisii monarchy:and that ‘the trade and navigation of the subjects of ‘ Great Britain and Holland might thereby be ‘ better securedi>ince, therefore, the empire and hereditary countries of Austria were now fallen to Chailes the third, who at the time of that treaty, was a younger branch of that House; since several towns in the French Flanders, which were not in the possession of king Charles the second at the time of his death, together with Spanish Flanders, Milan, and Naples, might seem a reasonable satisfaction for his imperial majesty’s pretensions to the Spanish succession; and since the trade and navigation of the subjects; of Great Britain and Holland would be as effectually secured by the disposition of the kingdom of Sicily to the duke of Savoy, as if the said kingdom had fallen to the share of the emperor; and greater difficulties would be likely to arise in obtaining the disposition thereof to the bouse of Austria than to that duke, inasmuch as king Philip might be more easily induced to yield it to the duke of Savoy than to so potent a prince as the emperor; and there were grounds to believe that all or most of the princes and states of Italy were so apprehensive of the growing power of the House of Austria in Italy, that they would suffer any extremities, rather than submit that Sicily, together with Milan and Naples, should be in the hands of the emperor; the said earl doth

not discern how any project to dispose the said kingdom to that dnke could be thought unjust, dishonourable or pernicious, or an act of injustice to his imperial majesty, or violation of the grand alliance; nor doth the said earl remember in what respect it was contradictory to any declaration of her majesty, or the instruction she had given her plenipotentiaries:and in case her majesty thought-fit afterwards to employ any part of her fleet to assist that duke, her good and faithful ally, to take possession of that kingdom from the enemy, in consideration of the said duke’s steady adherence to the confederacy ant| great sufferings by such adherence, he the said earl is not able to discover why such assistance might not be given to the said duke, as well as to any other of her allies whatsoever: and since it is allowed, by this Article, that the then duke of Savoy never made any application in order to obtain the said kingdom for himself; it seems an evidence, at least, that the person or persons who advised the late queen to agree to such allotment did not act upon any private interest; or had any other view than the preservation of a balance of power in Europe, and the security of the trade and navigation of the subjects of Great Britain and Holland; and cannot reasonably be thought, upon a fair and candid interpretation, to have been guilty of betraying the national faith or honour of the crown, or employing the naval power of these kingdoms, or - the supplies granted by parliament, against any ally of this kingdom.

“ In Answer to the Fifteenth Article; 'the said Earl saith, he is and always was of opinion, that the word of the sovereign is sacred:and that all communications from the throne to parliament ought to be true; and that it becomes all ministers of state, as far as in them lies, to maintain the honour of the crown, in such cases, with the utmost exactness: nor doth the said earl know that he hath at any time been defective in his duty in this particular; or ever took upon himselftmy arbitrary or unwarrantable authority, mufch less the chief direction and influence in her majesty’s councils; nor did he ever prostitute the honour of the crown, Or dignity of parliament, by misrepresenting any part of the late negotiations of peace, to deceive either her majesty, her allies, ‘her parliament, or her people:nor did he ever prepare, form, or concert, or advise her majesty to make, any speech or declaration from the throne to her parliament, that was not conformable to truth. He believes her -majesty might make several speeches from the throne, to- ner parliament, at the several times in the said Article mentioned, to which the said earl refers; and particularly, that her majesty did, on the 7th day of December 1711, declare, That her allies,

* especially the States General, had, by their

* ready compliance for opening a treaty of « ‘ general peace, expressed their confidence Ht

* her.’ But the said earl, uot admitting there

4£5] PARL. HISTORY, 2 Geo roe X 1715wo Me Impeachment, £186

^ were such representations as suggested in this article, begs leave, in vindication of the honor of his royal mistress, who was a princess of strict piety and troth, to observe, that the States General sent over M. Buys to her majesty, with letters full of assurances of their respect for her person, and their resolutions not to separate themselves from her; and likewise signified by him to her ministers, their readiness to concur with her majesty; and the said M. Buys immediately upon his arrival at London, delivered passports for the French ministers to come to Utrecht; and at a meeting of several lords ef the. council, shewed his approbation of sending circular letters to invite the rest of the allies to the general Congress: and the said M. B6ys exhibited full powers for preparing and siguing a new treaty, whereby her majesty and the States should be mutually engaged to each other in making war and peace, to guaranty the peace when made, and to invite the rest of the allies into such guaranty. All which matters and transactions being previous to the 7th of December 1711, her majesty might justly regard the aforesaid authentic acts and assurances as greater proofs of the confidence the States had in her, and of their readiness to concur with .her, than any representations or reports before that time; and that the said declaration of her majesty from the throne was founded upon the strictest truth. And the said earl believes, that every one who impartially considers the steps' taken in the late negociations of peace, the length of the treaty, the several letters from one of her majesty’s principal secretaries of state to her plenipotentiary at Utrecht, the ratification of the engagement signed by her ministers and M. Buys the 18th of December 1711, and her exhorting the States to ratify the same; her pressing instances to the princes and states of the empire, and the many other-acts which were done by her majesty’s orders, during that transaction, for the service and satisfaction of her allies; will readily acknowledge, that her majesty did her utmost to procure for her allies, and in particular for his imperial majesty, all reasonable satisfaction, and to unite with them in the strictest engagements to render the peace secure and lasting, agreeable to her speech of the said 7th day of December, and her message of the 17 th of January following, in this article mentioned:and if, by any extraordinary demands or groundless jealousies of any of the allies, or other accidents, her majesty was not able to obtain for them all the advantages she desired, this will not derogate from the truth and sincerity of her majesty’s expressions; and it is evident her majesty did procure them so great satisfaction, that the allies did all sign the peace at the same time with her majesty, excepting only the emperor; and even his interests were so far adjusted, that what remained in dispute was not thought of consequence sufficient to delay so great and good -a work; and it is well known the emperors of Germany have frequently declined "eigmng their treaties of peace at the same time

with their allies:but that her majesty was induced by any influence of the said earl to enter into any negociation .with France, exclusive of her allies, or that the said eacj carried .on any such negociation; or that the interest of the said allies, or in particular of the emperor, were, by any practices of his, given up to France, he utterly denies. And when it is considered, that much British blood and treasure had been spent to recover Spain and the West Indies from the house of Bourbon: that an expensive war had for many years continued, Vhich her majesty still supplied with new recruits and redoubled expence; that her armies, and those of the allies, had been beaten in Spain:that prince Eugene had declared, That 40,000 men

* and 4,000,000 of crowns per annum, would ‘ be necessary for carrying on that war, and

* that his master could supply no more than a ‘ fourth part of that chargethat it was found, by long experience how averse the people of Spain in general were to submit themselves to the house of Austria; that her majesty discerned the charge of renewing the war in Spain

, would be a burthen too great for her subjects, and that there was little probability of its being successful: that the hereditary countries were then, by the death of the emperor Joseph, fallen to king Charles, who was soon after chosen emperor (by which event the interests of the princes and states of Europe were changed); it cannot be doubted but that her late majesty had, at the time when she made the aforesaid declaration, done her utmost to recover Spain and the West Indies by force of arms:and the most she could do afterwards was by way of negociation, wherein she insisted with that earnestness on king Philip’s quitting Spain, that France complied with her majesty’s proposals: but when king Philip could not be prevailed on to give up Spain, her majesty thought his renunciation of the crown of France, as circumstances then stood, the most practicable, if not the oply method left, to prevent the union of those two mo narchies. But the said earl doth not think it probable, that the leaving Spain and the West Indies to the house of Bourbon was the foundation of the preliminary articles sigued by M. MeSnager, and of the declaration annexed, ♦which had been signed by the lord Dartmouth and Mr. St. John, with her majesty’s consent, (and which the said earl supposes is what is called the private treaty in this article ), since he believes it was then thought more likely that the crown of Spain might fall to some other prince. And the said e-drl doth not observe how her majesty can be charged with uttering any falsity in her message of the 17th day of January, wherein she takes notice how groundless the reports were, that had been spread, of a separate peace being treated; for which report there was not then, nor at any other time, the least foundation; since only some few points were adjusted, relating to the particular'interests of her own kingdoms, and even those were to have no effect but

upon the conclusion of a general peace, and were likewise, before such conclusion, communicated to the allies. And the said earl denies that thenceforth, or at any time, there was carried on by him any separate measures with the ministers of France, nor doth he conceive that the proposal about the renunciation was merely speculative; but that it was of such a nature, as would execute itself, and keep the crowns of France and Spain more effectually divided than ever; if it be considered, that it did not consist only in a renunciation to be made by Philip, then in pos-, session of the crown of Spain, of his contingent right to that of France; but that there was a title to the crown of France thereby given to the duke of Orleans, and after him to the rest of the princes of the house of Bourbon, who could not be presumed to want the will, nor would be likely to want the power, to take possession of the crown of France, by virtue of such title, in opposition to a prince at such a distance, 'and who had solemnly renounced all his pretensions to it: nor can the said earl think the declaration of any minister of France against such expedient (if any such there was, made) a sufficient ground for her majesty to decline it. The said earl therefore must' beg leave to repeat, that he is not able to discover, from any thing that appears in those speeches, that, in the particulars aforementioned, or any other, the essential points relating to peace and commerce, or which concerned the interests either of her allies or Great Britain, were mis- represented by her majesty: nor doth he know or believe, that any instance can be given wherein he abused the favour of his royal mistress, to whom he did always bear and pay the most sincere veneration and duty; or wherein he did mislead her parliament into any groundless or fatal resolution, or prevented their advice to her majesty, or obtained their approbation to any dangerous practice; or whereby her majesty could be ever deprived of the confidence of her allies, or exposed to contempt.

t(In Answer to the Sixteenth Article; the said Earl doth insist, that, by the laws and constitution of this realm, it is the undoubted right and prerogative of the sovereign, who is the fountain of honour, to create peers of this realm, as well in time of parliament, as when there is no parliament sitting or in being; and that the exercise of this branch of the prerogative is declared, in the form er preamble of all patents of honour, to proceed ‘ ex mero motu/ as an act of mere grace and favour; and that such acts are not done, as many other acts of a public nature are, by and with the advice of the privy council; or as acts of pardon usually run, upon a favourable representation of several circumstances > or upon reports from the attorney general, or other officers, that such acts are lawful or expedient, or for the safety pr advantage of the crown; but flows entirely from the beneficent and gracious disposition •f the sovereign. He farther saitb, that neither

the warrants for patents of honour, the.bills or other engrossments of such patents, are at any time communicated to the council or the treasury, as several other patents are; and there* fore the said earl, either as high treasurer or privy counsellor, could not have any knowledge of the same t nevertheless, if her late sacred majesty had thought fit to acquaint him with her hiost gracious intentions of creating any number of peers of this realm, and had asked his opinion, whether the persons whom she then intended to create were persons proper to have been promoted to that dignity, he does believe he should have highly approved her majesty’s choice; and doth not apprehend that, in so doing, he had been guilty of any breach of his duty, or violation of the trust in, him reposed, since they were all persons' of honour and distinguished merit; and the peerage thereby was not greatly increased, considering some of those created would have been peers by descent, and that many titles of peers were then lately extinct: and the said earl believes many instances may be given, where this prerogative hath been exercised by former princes of this realm in as extensive a manner, and particularly in the reign6 of king Henry 8, king James 1, and his late majesty king William. The said earl begs leave to add, that in the whole course of his life, he hath always loved the established constitution; and in lus private capacity, as well as in all public stations when he had the honour to he employed, hath ever done-his utmost to preserve it, and shall always continue so to do.

In ANSWER to the further ARTICLES of IMPEACHMENT exhibited against the

said Earl.

“ As to the First of thoseArticles he saith, That he believes, in or about the month of January 1710, an expedition was projected, for making a conquest of the city of Quebeck, on the river of St. Lawrence, Canada or other possessions of the French king, in North America; hut denies he advised her majesty either to consent to the making spch expedition, or to give orders for detaching any battalions of the forces in her majesty’s service in Flanders, or to send any such battalions or any squadron of men of war on the said enterprise:but having heard that the said project, or some expedition of the like nature, had been some time before considered in a committee of council, and afterwards laid aside for that time; and not being fully apprised of the whole project, nor, so1 well versed in the affairs of that part of the world as others who had more opportunity of knowing them, and lest the expedition might not at that time prove so \ feazable or advantageous as others of better knowledge in those matters than himself did expect; he did all that he apprehends his duty required to prevent the putting the same into execution, _ and expressed his concern at it to some persons about the queen; and, having so farsbsuflfc

IS] PARL. HISTORY, 2 Geo roe I. 1715* — -to the Articles of . [19

his opinion of*the said design at that time, believes it would not have been thought proper for him to have appeared at the meetings, where the methods only of carrying on the expedition were to be adjusted; of which meetings there had been but few before a. misfortune befel him, which confined him to his bed. But the said earl denies that he knew the said expedition was dangerous and destructive; nor did he hear that it was laid aside formerly, by a committee of council, as dangerous or impracticable, but only as improper in the circumstances of affairs at that time; nor doth the said earl know, or believe the •aid expedition was set on foot with any design to promote the interest of the French king or to weaken the confederate army in Flanders, or to dissipate the naval forces of this kingdom: and when others of her majesty's council, better acquainted with that affair, did judge it to be proper and practicable, he did not think it became him, upon the strength of his own •ingle judgment, further to oppose an expedition, which, if it had succeeded, most certainly would have given a great and sensible blow to the settlements and trade of France in that part of the world. And the said earl, with good reason, is persuaded your lordships will not think it unfit that her majesty should take the opinion of those who better understood affairs of that nature, or that your lordships can judge the said earl in that respect to have been wanting in his duty to her majesty; but hopes it will be rather an evidence of his fidelity to the queen and his country, that he so far discouraged what, in Ills own judgment, he was diffident of: however, he is satisfied that those of her majesty's council who did approve the expedition acted therein with a .sincere desire for the public good, notwithstanding the ill success it was attended with; which might chiefly be owing to delays by contrary winds, and other unforeseen accidents: and he doth not believe that her majesty's allies did suffer any prejudice, or the common enemy receive any advantage, by the detaching of forces from Flanders to serve on this enterprize; and is informed, that, to prevent any such danger, her majesty’s general who commanded at that time in Flanders had orders for providing other forces hi their place, if he judged it necessary. And the said earl doth acknowledge, that the sum of 28,000l. or thereabouts, was demanded at the treasury, about June 1711, on account of arms, accoutrements, goods, and merchandize, said.to be sent on the said expedition to Canada: But he saith, that he was so far from advising her late majesty that the said sum should be issued and paid, that, on the contrary, he put a stop to the payment of the same, until he had done all he could at that time to examine into the expenditure of the said money: But being then high treasurer df Great Britain, and having received her majesty's orders to pay the •aid sum, and not being able, with his utmost precaution, then to discover any just cause why it should not be paid, he did afterwards, in

obedience to those orders, and according to the duty of his place, countersign a warrant to the pay-master of her majesty's forces for the payment of the same, pursuant to which, he believes, the same was issued and received. And as to that part of the said article which charges the said earl with employing his arts or credit to keep the House of Commons from examining th^t affair: he begs leave to say. That (wliate\*er suspicions he might entertain in his own mind) he did not, upon examination, find that there was sufficient proof to justify the laying them before either House of Parliament: And although he hath been informed that the papers relating to that expedition were laid before the last, and have been all along in the power of the present. House of Commons; yet he hath not heard that any fraud hath been made out in that affair, notwithstanding the gentlemen who had them under their inspection, neither wanted ability to make the utmost discoveries, nor could be supposed to be prevented therein by any influence of the said earl; and he hopes it will not be imputed to him as a fault, if he had used any skill dr credit to keep the House of Commons from examining this affair at that juncture, when by an unseasonable inquiry, before a proper proof could be had, the fraud (if any such there were) would be likely for ever to escape unpunished; But the said earl denies that he ever exercised or had any arbitrary power or influence, either in her majesty's private council or the great council of the nation; or entertained any design to prevent the justice due to the queen or the nation; or that any discovery had been made to him, further than what might give suspicion to one who was always jealous (as became him) of any misapplication of the public treasure. And the said earl saith, that he is not conscious, that, by any letter or memorial to her majesty, he hath acted contrary to his duty; bu£ humbly hopes he may be allowed to observe, that it would be a matter of particular hardship, and what seems tojiim inconsistent with the rules of government, and without precedent, if the most secret and intimate papers and letters, wrote to that most renowned and pious princess her late majesty, by her own special command, and for her own private perusal, should be imputed to any as a crime: And if any quotation from any such letter or paper could be alledged against the said earl, he doubts not but there might appear, from* other of her majesty’s private papers, what would justify him in many particulars wherewith he is charged, and would give further proof (if it were needful) how tender and affectionate hfer majesty was to all her subjects.

“ In Answer to the Second Additional Article; the said Earl doth admit, that, about October 1711, her late majesty did sign a warrant directed to him, then her treasurer of Great Britain, for the issuing and payment of the sum of 13,000l. to John Drummond, estf. iu tht

191] PARL. HISTORY, 2 Geoi«i 1. 1715. — The Earl of Oxford's Answer {19$

Article named: and that, on or about the 24th of November following, in pursuance of the said warrant under her majesty's sign manual, he the said earl did sign a warrant for the payment of the said 13,000l.; but, for more certainty, begs leave to refer to the said several warrants, when the same shall be produced. And the said earl takes the words [“ for special services of the war”] to have been inserted by mistake of the clerks, for he absolutely denies that he gave any direction for those words, or any other of like import, to be inserted; and he believes all the clerks of the treasury know, that the monies which arose from the sale of tin, were the queen's proper money, for the support of her household, and such occasions as she should please to direct, and not appropriated to the services of the war; although sometimes it hath been practised, thpt loans have been taken upon tin tallies, for the services of the war, and qther public services, and afterwards repaid to the civil list, which might possibly give occasion for such mistake. And the said earl saith, that, having been acquainted with the servicesthe said Mr. Drummond had performed, by order of the late earl of Godolphin, in borrowing money upon tin at a low interest, the said earl asked Mr. Drummond's consent, that a sum in tin tallies might be struck in his name; and, with such consent, did direct that orders amounting to the sum of 13,000l. should be charged in the register of the exchequer, on the monies arising by the sale of tin, in the name of the said Mr. Drummond, who afterwards, before his going to Holland, indorsed the said orders at the said earl's request, and left them in the treasury; but how long it was befdre the said orders were indorsed, Or how long they remained afterwards in the treasury, the said earl doth not particularly remember; but doth acknowledge, that the said orders and tallies came afterwards to h» own hands, and were disposed for his own use. But, in order to lay the true state of this affair before your lordships, the said earl humbly represents, that, upon his first attending the late queen after his being wounded, her majesty bad the goodness to tell him, ‘ That she ‘ designed bim a sum of moneyUpon which, he represented to her majesty the bad condition of her civil list. But several times after, her majesty asked him, ‘ Why he did not find a way for receiving the money she intended ‘ bim, and bring the necessary warrants for that ‘purpose?' He still urged the same reason against it; and for near six months made no step in it; till atlast her majesty was pleased to say, ‘ She was resolved to have it done.’ And as her majesty had, m matters of her bounty, made use of tin tallies for other persons, she was pleased to mention the same herself; and ordered proper warrants to be prepared for the sum which her majesty of ber royal bounty intended him. That, after her majesty had so positively signified her royal pleasure to bestow such mark of her favour upon the said earl, the said tallies and orders '

were struck, in Mr. Drummond’s name, - with her majesty’s knowledge, and at the said' earl’s nomination; and from that time the same were kept under the said earl's direction, for his use; and the said earl was advised, that nothing, further was requisite to be done, after the assignment of the said Mr. Drummond, for securing the said earl's interest in the said tallies, till an accident happened, which made it necessary, for further security, to have the said warrant, as a declaration of trust; which was accordingly signed by her majesty, and is to the effect following ‘A. R. Whereas, in ‘the year of our Lord 1711, in^consideraiiot* ‘ of the many good, faithful, and acceptable ‘ services, which before that time had been ‘ performed unto us, by our right trusty and ‘ right well-beloved cousin and counsellor Ro-‘ bert earl of Oxford (then and now our high ‘ treasurer of Great Britain ), which services

* have tended to the quiej, safely, and pros-‘ perity, of us and our realms, though the same ‘ were accompanied with great difficulties upon

* himself, and hazards to him and Ids family; ‘ and particularly reflecting upon the impious

* attempt made upon his life; we did then ‘ fully resolve, as a particular mark of oor fa-

* vour, and of our gracious acceptance of the ‘ said earl's services, to bestow upon him a sum

* in ready money - But the said earl represent-‘ ing to us, that the .arrears then due to our servants and tradesmen, chargeable upon our

* civil list, weretery great and pressing; We ‘ did therefore agree and determine, that the

* said earl should have to his own use the se-‘ veral sums amounting to 13,000l. comprized ‘ in certain orders of loan, bearing date on or ‘ about the 11th day of December 1711, in ‘ your name, and charged upon the register in ‘ our exchequer, on the monies arising by sale ‘ of our tin which orders are not yet in course ‘ of payment. Now we do hereby declare and ‘ make known, that the said several sums, ‘ amounting to 13,000l. coutnined in the said ‘ orders, and the interest thereof due and to be ‘ due, are, and shall be the proper monies of the

* said earl of Oxford; and we do hereby direct

* and authorize you to transfer and assign the said ‘ orders and the whole right and benefit there *

‘ of to the said earl and his assigns, or to such per-‘ son or persons as he shall appoint in that behalf:

‘ and in case any the monies due or to be

* due or payable, upon the said orders, shall ‘ come to your hands, in such case, our plea-‘ sure is, that you forthwith pay over the same ‘ to the said earl, his executors, administrators, ‘ or assigns, to his and their own use and "*behoof, without any accompt to be thereof ‘ rendered to us, our heirs or successors; and ‘ this our warrant, or an attested copy thereof,

‘ shall be your sufficient warrant and discharge ‘ for so doing. Given at our court at Windsor

* Castle, the 14th day of December, and the 12th ‘ year of our reign, a. d. 1713. To our trusty and ‘ well beloved John Drummond, esq.’ And the said earl believes the said warrant was drawn by Mr. Lowndes, secretary to the treasury; and

199} PAUL. HISTORY, 2 Giorgi I. l *t 1 Articles <jf [l9d

bywhat means the same was omitted to be entered in the treasury, he knows not: but, upon hearing there was a discourse about that said 13,000l. in tin tatties, he sent a copy of the said warrant to the officers of the treasury, without signifying any desire to have the same entered; well knowing it received its authority. from the sign manbai, which wanted no additional force from any entry thereof in the treasury books. And the said earl saith, That her majesty was pleased j of her mere goodness and bounty, and of her own free wilt, to give him the said sum of money, ih rfeward of his faithful services, and for his sufferings hi her service. And the said earl saith, That the said grant, according to the discount upon those tallies at that time, amount* ed to the sum of 10,000l. or thereabouts, wfaerein he acknowledged the great bounty of fwr majesty; and takes notice, that grants much larger have been made from the crown to other ministers of state, while the necessities of the crown have been equally pressing. And the said earl doth not know that, in this, or any other part of his administration, he ever was guilty of any corruption, or any breach of his oath or trust as high treasurer of Great Britain; or that he did in any manner abuse her majesty’s goodness, or make an ill use of his access to her majesty, or embezzle the public treasure; or did at any time knowingly injure or oppress her majesty’s subjects: but, on the contrary, the said earl saith, that he managed the public money in the most frugal manner, in order to lessen as much as might be the charge of the war; and to ease, if he could, the Commons of Great Britain from all grievous taxes. And, in further vindication of himself against all the imputation of avarice or corruption insinuated m this article, the said earl saith, That, in every employment to which he was called by her majesty’s favour, he was always contented with the accustomed incomes and profits of the said employments, without endeavouring to increase his gain by any unwarrantable or extraordinary perquisites: that whilst lie was in any office of trust about her late majesty, be never abused that trust, in making any manner of profit or advantage to himself; either by the disposal of places in his own gift, or by the recommendation of persons to her majesty for such as were granted immediately by herself: That neither in or out of place did he ever receive 'any pension from the crown: that, as he came with dean hands into her majesty’s service, so went not only with clean, but almost empty bauds out of it, having spent therein most part of the profits which accrued to him from the places he enjoyed; so that, at this time, notwithstanding all the advantages he received from them, and the extraordinary bounty of the queen to him, in this article mentioned, he can with great truth affirm, that his private fortune hath received very inconsiderable addition thereby.

“ In Answer to the Third Additional Article; - the said Earl saith, That, Matthew Prior, esq. Vot. VII,

being employed by her late majesty at the court of France, warrants were signed in the usual form, for payment of several sums of money to the said Mr. Prior; which he believes, from the 27 th of August 1712 to the 10th of July 1714, might amount to the sum of 12, 360/. as in the said article is set forth; and he believes he did pay, or cause to be paid, at several times, the said sums, pursuant to tho authority he had from her late majesty for that purpose; which, he conceives, was not only lawful, but a duty incambent on him. He further saith, That he doth not know that, by any law, there ought to be certain appointments or allowances, for the maintenance and support of ambassadors, envoys, plenipotentiaries, and other public ministers of the crown in foreign courts:but that her majesty was at liberty to vary such appointments, and the manner of paying them, as she in her wisdom should think fit, out of any funds appropriated to the civil list. He doth believe that there are several instances, where persons employed to negotiate matters of importance, as ambassadors or penitentiaries, have been allowed 1, 500/. for their equipage, 100/. a week for their ordinary entertainment, and 1, 600/. for extraordinaries; and likewise further sums for services performed by special order: and if the said Mr. Prior had been paid upon that foot, he would have been entitled to a greater sum frotn the crown, for the time wherein he was employed by her majesty as aforesaid, over and above all disbursements for special services. And the said earl saith. That he takes the said Matthew Prior to have been sent by her majesty into France for her majesty’s service, and in order to carry on the negotiations of a general peace: but denies that he was any creature of the said earl, or sent by the said earl into France, or that he carried on any negotiations of the said earl, or that her majesty was prevailed on by his counsels to send the said Matthew Prior as her plenipotentiary to the French king, without the privity ofj or any communication with, the allies; or that'the said earl used the least contrivance for carrying on, or did carry on or promote any dangerous practices with the ministers of France, or the enemies of her majesty or her kingdoms; or that he did at any time combine with the said Matthew Prior, to defraud her majesty of any sum of money whatsoever, under colour of his employment; or that the said. Matthew Prior was sent into France, with the character aforesaid, without any settled appointment or allowance for any such end; or that he the said earl did give the said Matthew Prior an unlimited credit, or promised to pay him any bills whatsoever, other than what he should be duly authorized to pay; or that any bills of exchange in the said article mentioned were drawn in pursuance of any such contrivance. The said earl saith, Thar, Thomas Ilarley esquire having been twice sent by her late majesty to the court of Hanover, he the said earl, being then high treasurer of Great Britain; paid, or caused to b# O

\

1*95] PAUL. HISTORY, 9 Giotftt i 1715. — <tf Osforf* [190

paid to the said Mr. Harley the sum of 5, 560/. or thereabouts, by authority from her majesty, and'according to the duty of his office^ out of monies appropriated to the use of the civil list; and he believes that, if Mr. Harley had received an allowance in proportion to what hath been paid to ambassadors, it would have amounted to a greater sum; but denies that the said sum 5, 560/. or any part of it, was paid without authority, or for promoting any wicked purposes of the said earl; or that he did either illegally or fraudulently issue or direct, or advise the direction or payment of, any sum or sums of money, out of her majesty's treasury, to any person whatsoever; or that he ever entered into any combination with the persons abovementioned, or any other person whatsoever, to defraud her majesty of any of the public money which he was entrusted with the management of

“ In Answer to the Fourth Additional Article; the said Earl denies that he ever held any correspondence with Mary, the late consort of the late king James the 2nd, dither by the means of Mr. Prior or by any other means whatsoever; or that he ever intended, or had the least design, any way to promote the interest of the Pretender:Nor doth the said earl know or believe, that M. Gaultier, in the said Article named, was entrusted or employed .as an agent, between any of the ministers of Great Britain and France, in transacting any affairs relating to the Pretender; and denies that he the said earl had any conferences with him the said M. Gaultier on that subject; nor doth the said earl know, or believe, that the said M. Gaultier was empowered to concert with him the said earl particularly the settling any payment or remittance of the annuities hereafter mentioned, or any other yearly sum to be paid or remitted out of her majesty’s treasury into France: Neither had the said earl the least design that any of the fruits or. advantages of the peace should be made an offering to any adherent of the Pretender; nor did he agree or undertake to procure the payment of the yearly sum of 47,0001. or any other yearly sum, to the use of the laid late consort during her life. Hot the laid sari doth admit, that the late king James the dad, by letters patents, \mder the great seal of England, bearing date on or about the 28th day .of, August in the year 1085, granted unto Lawrence earl of Rochester, Henry earl of Peterborough, Sidney lord Godolphin, Robert Win den, esquire, and sir Edward Herbert, knight, (who are all since deceased,) divers annuities, or yearly sums of money, amounting to 37, 3*28/. 13s. Id. payable out of the hereditary duty of excise ana the post office, and other revenues in the said letters patents mentioned, to hold, to them and their heirs, during the life of the said consort, in trust for her; fend, by other letters patents, bearing date on or about the third day of December in the year 1680/ also granted unto the said consort a further pension , or yearly sum, of 10,000l., to hold

during her natural life; whereby the said revenues arising from the hereditary excise and post office, and other the revenues in the said letters patents mentioned, became charged with, and were liable to, the said annuities or yearly sums, as in this article is mentioned:And the said earl doth admit, that the said revenues were, by several acts of parliament, granted and settled during the life of his late majesty king William the 3rd, for the use and service of his household and family, and, for other his necessary expenses and occasions: and after his demise, during the life of her late majesty queen Anne, were appointed to be for the support of her household, and of the honour and dignity of the crown:But saith, that, in the same act of parliament whereby the said revenues are so appointed, there is a general saving to all and every person and persons, of au such rights, titles, estates, interests, claims, and demands whatso-. ever, of, in, or to, or out of the said revenues and hereditaments, or any of them, as they or any of them had, or ought to have had, before the making the said act, as fully to all intents and purposes as if the said act had never been made: And the said earl doth admit, that an act of parliament was made in the 12th year of her late majesty’s reign, whervby the sum of 500,000l., for the causes therein mentioned, was to be applied (in aid of the revenues or branches which were appointed for the support of her majesty’s household, and of the honour and dignity of the crown) for or towards the paying and discharging such arrears of salaries, wages, diet money, and other allowances, and such debts, for emptions, provisions, and other causes, as should appear to oe due and owing to her majesty’s servants, tradesmen, and others. But the said earl saith, be hath heard that the said late consort of the late king James die 2nd, esteeming herself to be entitled, by the laws of England, by virtue of the said tetters patents, to the several sums of money therein mentioned, did, by letters of attorney, empower and authorize the said Mi Gaultier to demand and receive, for her only use, benefit and behoof, all sums of money, which, from and after the feast of the Annunciation of the blessed Virgin Mary 1713, were become due and payable upon the said several annuities, anumming to 37, 338/. 13s. 7; and the other annoity, or yearly sum, of 10,000l.; and to give acquittances and discharges for the monieiM should so receive to her only use mad behoof as aforesaid; and that thereupon lie die said M. Gaultier applied himself to her majesty, for the payment of the monies which were incurred or mown due on the said several annuities, from the said 25th day of March 1713; and that her majesty was pleased to sign a warrant directed to him, the said earl, being then her majesty’s high treasurer, or to the high treasurer or commissioners of the treasury, for the time being, in the words) or to the effects, in the said Article set forth; b.ot, for more certainty, refers himself to the said.

warrant, when the same shall be produced: -and that, in obedience to her majesty's commands signified by the said warrant, he the said earl did direct two several warrants (to the auditor of the receipt of the Exchequer to the . effect in the said Article set forth; but, for more certainty, refers to the said several warrants, when the same shall be produced. But be denies he advised her majesty to sign the said warrant of the 23rd of December 1713. But when such warrant was bronght, to him, and he knew'that the jointure of the said consort had been confirmed by act of parliament, and had heard that, by some private Article or agreement at the treaty at Ryswick, provision had been made in relation to it; and the -legality of the demand not being doubted by her majesty's counsel learned in the law, the said earl'thought it his duty to pay obedience to jt, and the sum of 500,000l., intended to be raised by the said act of the , 12th year of her majesty's reign, together with a great additional sum in tallies, being designed for discharge of her majesty's debts, the said earl thought himself sufficiently authorised to direct, that the said sum of money mentioned in the said warrants, which he was advised was a debt from her majesty, should be paid out of the said 500,000l.; yet the sum in the said warrants mentioned, or any part thereof, was not paid out of the said appropriated sum of 500,000l. or otherwise;

' but the whole sum of 500,000l. was applied to other uses, for which it was appropriated. And the said earl humbly hopes, that ne hath not hereby betrayed the honour of her late majesty, Or the imperial crown of these realms, or acted contrary to his duty. And the said earl doth acknowledge, that the said M. Gaultier 'coming into England with letters of credence from the French king to her late majesty, after having resided some time in England; her . majesty was pleased, before his departure bence^'to direct a present should be made to the said M. Gaultier, as hath been usual in like cases to public ministers: and he believes her said majesty was the rather inclined to make such present to the said M. Gaultier, because the said earl hath heard and takes it to be true, that the said Gaultier had been instrumental with the French king to obtain the delivery and release of those poor protestants, who had suffered on board the galiies on account of their religion; whose rescue from slavery her majesty, out of her known zeal to the protestant religion, and out of her wonted piety and compassion to the confessors in so good a cause, bad much at heart, and had prevailed therein beyond expectation; it being what by his majesty king William had been attempted in vain, and was thought by many impossible' ever to be obtained:And the good offices of the said Gaultier in that affair having been very acoeptable to her majesty, she was pleased to increase his present in respect thereof; and therefore ordered it to be paid in the same manner as had been done to others, whose presents her majesty thought fit

‘to augment: And for this end, her majesty, about the time in this article mentioned, did sign a warrant, directing the ‘ payment of 1,000l. sterling to Daniel Arthur, esq. in the same Article mentioned, to the intent might be paid to the said M. Gaultier, on ' the - account aforesaid; and the said earl believes the said monies were issued and paid accordingly, and doth not apprehend be bath therein acted contrary to his duty.

“ In Answer to the Fifth Additional Article; the said Earl doth admit, the sovereign of this realm may refuse to receive any natural-born subject, who hath committed and is under the guilt of high treason, as a public minister, or with any character from any foreign prince, state, or potentate: and that where such person is known to be guilty of such crime, it may in most cases be fit so to do: But the said earl apprehends that the sovereign is the proper judge whom to refuse or receive with such character. Die said earl believes, that a person styling himself, or commonly known by the name of Lilcot or Lawless, did, about the

{rear 1712 or 1713, come into England, with etters of credence to her majesty, from the king and the late queen of Spain, and authority to treat about carrying British merchandizes to-the Spanish West Indies; and that her majesty was pleased to admit such person with such letters of credence; and before his return to Spain, was pleased to order, for the use of such person, the sum of 1,000l., to he paid out of the monies appropriated to the civil list; which the said earl, in obedience to such orders, caused to he paid, and humbly apprehends <k was his duty so to do: Bui the said earl believes, that when the said Lilcot or Lawless was sO admitted, he was generally thought to be a natural Spaniard; and that, from, the advantages of those licences which he brought for carrying the British merchandizes to the West Indies he expected a much larger present: however, the said earl denies that he knew, or was informed, before the arrival of the said Lawless in England, any thing of his coming hither; nor, after his arrival, did he see him, or know of hiis being here, before he had been introduced to her majesty, it being usual for public ministers to he introduced, by those servants of her majesty to whose office it belongs, as matter of duty and common dispatch, without consulting therein other ministers of state; and, upon the notice taken of this affair, formerly in the House of Peers, it appeared, that the noble lord who introduced the said Lawless to the queen, by virtue of his office did it as of course, and did not then know he was other than a native of Spain. And the said earl saith. That, of a long time after he had been so introduced, the said earl neither knew or heard that he was other than a natural Spaniard but, when the said person had continued in England, a considerable time, there was a rumour, and the said earl was afterwards in-

formed, he was a native of Ireland, and de-arted out of that kingdom in his youth, and ad since been in the Spanish service; but doth not know por was informed, that he had 'committed or been guilty of high treason, or that he had served the late king James the 2d, in the war in Ireland, against king William the 3d, or had followed the said king James the 2d, into France, or been in his interest or service, or had been in rebellion against king William, or iu arms against the late queen. And the said earl, hiving no notice of the said person's arrival before his being admitted to her majesty, non any knowledge of any crime he was guilty of, submits, whether it shall be imputed to him as any want of duty, that he did not advise her majesty against admitting or receiving him in the character aforesaid, or that he did, by her majesty's authority, meet, confer, or negociate with him, concerning aiiy affairs about which he was authorised to treat (in case he had so done, which however the said earl doth not admit); or that, by authority from her majesty he paid the said sum of 1,000l. to the said Daniel Arthur, which after came to his. use; but the said earl doth deny that he advised her majesty to sign the warrant for payment of the said 1,000l., or gave any directions for payment thereof, contrary to what was intended by her majesty. And the said earl admits, that some other sums of money, which might amount' in the whole to 015/. or thereabouts, were paid, in satisfaction 6f monies advanced to the said Lawless, as part of the monies agreed to be advanced to his catholic majesty by the Assiento contract: But denies that he directed the payment of any other monies whatsoever, out of her majesty’s treasury, to the said Lilesb, alias Lawless i or knows that any other monies were paid to him, beside the aforementioned sum of 1,000l., and the monies paid in satisfaction of what was advanced to him towards the part due to his catholic majesty by the said Assiento contract. And the said earl never assumed the supreme direction in her majesty’s councils; neither was he advising that the said person should be introduced to her majesty, or should be received or treated by her ministers, under the disguised name of Don Carlo Moro, or should at all be received as a public minister here. And the said earl doth acknowledge, that the House of Lords, with commendable zeal, made such address and came to such resolution, and that her majesty made such answer and issued ^uch proclamation, as in the said article is mentioned. And as the said earl had always the highest regard to the safely of her majesty’s person, the security of the protestant succession, and advice and resolutions of the House of Peers; so he denieth that he had the least knowledge that th? said Lelish, alias Lawless, had ever been minister or agent of the Pretender at the court of Madrid, or the least suspicion that he was sent into England to promote the interest of the Pretender in these kingdoms. Nor is he con-

scious to himself that he hath.done any thing to expose the person of her most sacred majesty, to enervate or render ineffectual the advice of parliament or her majesty’s declarations, to countenance any emissary of the Pretender or encourage his adherents, to the danger of the protestant succession, as by law established, in the serene house of Hanover r i But, on the contrary, is persuaded his conduct in that affair is so well known, as not to need any further justification: But, if it should at any time be thought necessary, he is able to produce those proofs of it, which are the best authority in the world, for his vindication.

“ In Answer to the Sixth Additional Article; the said Earl hath been informed, and doth believe it may be true, that, after several unsuccessful attempts by her late majesty, in conjunction with her allies, to establish his .present' imperial tpajesty upon the throne of Spain, instructions in writing were given to Mitford Crow, esquire, about the7th of March 1705; taking notice, 1 Her majesty bad been

* informed, that the people of Catalonia were

* inclined to cast off the yoke imposed on them

* by the French, and to return to the obedi-‘ ence of the house of Austria; and that her

* majesty, desiring to maintain and improve ‘ that good disposition in them, and to induce ‘ them to put the same speedily in execution,

‘ had made choice of him to carry on so great (a work, for the advantage of her service, and

* the good of the common cause, as was the making a treaty with the Catalans, or any

‘ other people of Spain, for the purposes afore-

* said} ana that the said Mitford Crow was ‘ thereby empowered to give the Catalans, or ‘ other Spaniards, assurances of her majesty’s ‘ utmost endeavours to procure the establish-‘ ment of all such rights and immunities as

* they had formerly enjoyed under the house ‘ of Austria, and the confirmation of such titles ‘ as had beep con for red on any of them by the

* duke of Anjou; and that, for their further ‘ satisfaction, her majesty had sent to king ‘ Charles the 3d, for powers for confirming the

* same to them, ana was willing, if they in-*sisted on it, to become guarantee that it

* should be done/ And the said earl hath been likewise informed that her majesty, in a commission, granted to the said Mitford Crow, expressed, ‘ that she thought fit to enter into a

* treaty, with the principality of Catalonia, or

* any other province of Spain, on condition ‘ they would acknowledge and receive Charles.

* the 3d as lawful king of Spain, and utterly ‘ abdicate the house of Bourbon, and join their

* forces with her majesty’sand that her majesty was pleased also to sign and deliver to (he said Mitford Crow credential letters, directed to the nobility, magistracy, and other officers of Catalonia, or any. other province of Spain, desiring them to give, faith to every thing, the said Mitford Crow should tell them in he? majesty's name: And that instructions were likewise given to the earl of Peterborough and

air Cloudesly Shovel ), about the time, and to the effect, in the said article mentioned; and that a manifesto, or declaration, was afterwards published by the said earl of Peterborough, to the effect in the said article set forth: But the said earl denies that such manifesto or declaration was prepared by his advice or privity; and the said earl'believes it may be true, that some part of the nobility, clergy, and inhabitants, of the principality of Catalonia and also of the inhabitants of the island of Majorca, did afterwards acknowledge king Charles the 3d, now emperor, for their lawful sovereign, and did join their arms with those of her majesty and her allies, against the present king of Spain; but by what motive they were induced thereunto, the said earl doth not know. And the said earl doth acknowledge, that, for some time, the arms of her majesty and her allies, in Spain, were attended with considerable successes, in which the bravery of the Catalans appeared, and the forces of the confederates twice entered the capital city of that kingdom; by which sig-"nal conquests, and the great supplies that have been granted by parliament for their assistance, the said people were under the highest obligations of gratitude to her majesty: But, the advantages those successes had given king Charles the 3d being lost, her majesty found the burthen of that war very heavy to her subjects, the conquest of Spain for the present emperor impracticable, and, after the accession of the empire and descent of the hereditary countries to him, esteemed inconsistent with the interests of many of her allies, and therefore thought it necessary, for the good of her people and the tranquillity of Europe, to enter into negotiations for a general peace: but the said earl denies that he entered into any conspiracy for subjecting the Spanish monarchy to the House of Bourbon, or even bad the least design of the ruin or destruction of any of the rights, liberties, or privilege^ of the Catalans; or that Jie ever formed any contrivance for abandoning them to the fury or revenge of the duke of Anjou or his adherents, or for the extirpation of any of their rights, liberties, or privileges; or that lie advised her majesty to give directions to the lord Lexington, to acknowledge the duke of Anjou king Spam, before any negotiation of peace was set on foot, indue form of law, between the crowns of Great Britain and Spain: on the contrary the said earl saith, That, by letters and papers sent by one of her majesty's principal secretaries of state to the lord Lexington, it will appear, that, after her majesty had hearkened to the proposals for a general peace, for the good of her own people and her allies, she used her best endeavours for obtaining the liberties of the Catalans at the conclusion of the peace; and that his lordship Was directed peremptorily and absolutely to insist thereon: nor doth the said earl know or believe, that any orders were ever sent from, or given by, her majesty to.any of l\pr ministers, to recede from that de-

mand, or that the said lord Lexington ever desisted from making the utmost efforts he could for obtaining it; and if, from any measures of the Catalans or of his imperial majesty, or from any other cause, her majesty’s endeavours had not their full effect, the said earl conceives it cannot be imputed to any neglect of her nuh jesty, or any want of duty in him the said earl. He believes that, about the time in the said article mentioned, his imperial majesty did enter into a convention or agreement for evacuating Catalonia; and that her majesty, out of inclination to perform her best offices to the emperor, was prevailed on to become one of the guarantees thereof; but denies that his imperial majesty was necessitated, by any practices of the said earl, to make any such convention; and is ignorant for what causes his imperial majesty, whom it most concerned, omitted, in such convention, to make express and positive stipulation for the liberties of the Catalans: if it proceeded from any dependance upon the declaration of her majesty to interpose her best offices' on their, behalf, and the promises of the French king to join his endeavours therein; he is confident, it will appear her majesty’s best offices were employed in that affair; when it is considered what repeated instances she made by her ministers, and in the most pathetic man her, to obtain for thorn the privileges they desired: and that her majesty, by her earnest interposition, did obtain a grant and confirmation to all the inhabitants of Catalonia, of a perpetual amnesty and oblivion of all that was done in the late war, tha full possession of all their estates and honours, and a farther grant of all their privileges, which the inhabitants of both Castilles, who of all the Spaniards were most dear to the king of Spain, enjoyed, #r might at any time after have or enjoy; whereby the Catalans, if they obtained not all the ancient privileges they pretended to. received however, in compensation thereof, the advantage of trading directly to the West Indies, and other privileges to which they were never before entitled:and the House of Peers, upon consideration of several papers laid before them relating to this affair, in pursuance of their address to her majesty in that behalf, expressed their utmost thankfulness and satisfaction, for her majesty’s repeated and earnest endeavours Cor preserving to the Catalans the full enjoyment of all their just and ancient liberties; and it is probable her majesty had prevailed, to obtain for them the ancient privileges and liberties in the largest extent, if they had waited the event of her gracious interpositions in their favour, and not determined to carry on the war by themselves against king Philip, after the emperor had signed the convention for evacuating their country; which incensed the king of Spain in the highest degree, and was looked upon by him as the roost obstinate rebellion. However, the said earl saith, he never amused the Catalans with any expectations whatsoever, nor in any degree contributed to» engage them in any obstinate de-

fence against the duke of Anjou; nor mjvised her majesty to conclude a peace with Spain, without security for the ancient rights, liberties, and privileges of that people; or to send sir James Wisnart with a squadron of men of war for the purposes in the said article mentioned, .but believes her majesty might think herself obliged, by being guarantee to the said convention for the evacuating of Catalonia, to send the said sir James YVishart into the Mediterranean, with a squadron of men of war, although he knows not the orders or instructions given on that occasion; and humbly apprehends, that he cannot in justice be charged with any consequences from that unhappy peo-le’s refusal to comply in their submission to the ingof Spain, upon the terms her majesty hath stipulated for them.

tlThus the said Earl has laid his case before your lordships; wherein he hopes, lie hath fully answered the several Articles exhibited against him. Yet, lest there should be'any omission'in his Answer, which may be made use of to his prejudice, be says, he is not guilty of all or any the matters contained in the said Articles, or any of them, in manner' and form as they are therein charged .against him:and humbly hopes that your lordships will excuse any imperfections or defects in the said Answer with regard to expression or form, and impute whatever of that kind may appear to the great weakness of body and ill state of health which the said earl now labours and hath for some months past laboured under; and that your lordships will be induced to make all further due allowances in his favour, from the following considerations, which relate to tha nature of the charge in general, and the difficulties with which his defence of himself against the particulars contained in that charge is, and must be, attended. Most of the Articles with which he stands charged relate entirely to the negotiations of the peace lately concluded at Utrecht. He doubts not hot your lordships will consider that he must of necessity be under great difficulties in giving a full arid particular account of such a great variety of facts as are contained in’ these Articles; that several of these facts Concern transactions with the ministers of foreign states, who cannot be produced as witnesses in his defence, be their testimony never so material; that many steps and proceedings in an affair of this natore, where the interest of several parties, not only separate from, but some of them also contrary to each other, are 'to be adjusted, do require great secrecy and address in the management; and that in treaties between enemies, such terms are often proposed, and such arguments used, as carry a different appearahee from the real intentions of those that treat; upon which accounts, it must be very difficult to set every thing that passed in the late negotiations, with regard to the enemy and to the allies, in a clear light, and to justify every step that was taken towards conducting them to the end proposed,

1715u — - The Earl of Oxfor [204

especially since the account of those transactions, ana of the reasons on winch they were founded, cannot, as he conceives, be .duly cleared, but by inspecting the entire series of letters and papers which passed during the continuance of those transactions, and by comparing together such passages in them as might give light to each other and to the whole; all which letters and papers are (as he is informed) now in the possession of the honourable House of Commons; nor was it thongbt fit, upon his humble application to your lordships, that he should be indulged with a copy of any of them: he hopes it may not misbecome him, on this occasion, to observe to your lordships, that the House of Commons, ' by being possessed of those papers, have a fuller view or the whole progress aod of all the secret steps of that negotiation, than perhaps was ever in the Kke case imparted to any House of Parliament, and they have therefore all the advantage possible towards forming the charge against him upon the Articles of his Impeachment; whereas lie the said earl, being destitute of all assistance from those papers, is under great and particular disadvantages towards making his defence in the points whereof he there stands accused; ana he is therefore humbly assured, that as your lordships, on the one side, will net expect from him any such

f)roofs of his innocence as can only be drawn rom a perusal of those papers; so, on the other, you will not admit of all or any of those Articles as made good against him, unless the accusations therein contained be supported by the clearest and most unquestionable evidence of which the nature of the facts is capable. He submits it likewise to your lordships consideration, whether, in a negociation drawn out into a great length, where the advice of all those in-high trust about her majesty eras to be taken, and where several persons were to be intrusted with the management of what was agreed upon, he can with any colour of equity be made answerable for advising and conducting the whole. He desires also further to observe, that every thing with which he is charged vfras dime in the reign of a gracious princess now deceased, who, by reason of the perfect knowledge she had of the ill state of affairs at home, of the advance; made towards peace from abroad, and of the commands which she at several times laid on her servants, bad been the best, and indeed could be the only competent judge, whether she was fraudulently dealt with, led by ill advice into measures which she did not direct and approve, or made an instrument of sacrificing the interest of- her kingdoms to the enemy. It is with great grief that be finds such _ things suggested, as seem to lay a stain upon > the character of so excellent a queen, whose memoiy, he is confident, will be for ever dear to this country; and therefore he takes leave in the most solemn manner to assure your lordships, that as far as he knows or can remember, every thing relating to the transactions of peace was communicated to her late majesty, aadougt

turely considered by her 'before any thing waf determined thereupon nor jvas any step taken, but in pursuance'of such detennination. . As to the peace in general: he the said earl thinks he has very good reason to say* that the queen had nothing, more at heart than, to procure so great a blessing for her people; and that, when it was obtained, she had this satisfaction in herself that she had taken the most proper measures to justify her conduct, both towards her allies and towards her own subjects; for' upon a review of her majesty’s whole proceeding in relation to war and peace, he believes it will appear, and hath in part appeared by the Answer of the said earl to the said Articles, that, as her majesty entered, further into the war than she was obliged by any treaties subsisting at the time of her accession to the throne, so she contributed more men and money towards the carrying it on afterwards than .she was engaged to provide by any subsequent treaties; that, her earnest desires of peace being twice frustrated, when such conditions might have been obtained as would have fully answered all the ends for which war. was at first declared; that all our successes and victories ending in the annual increase of the charge of England, without any further assistance from our allies:and her kingdoms being exhausted to such a degree (notwithstanding the great advantages obtained by her arms) that she was not able to continue the war, upon the foot it then stood, one year longer; whilst her allies refused to continue it upon those equal conditions to which ^hey were by treaties obliged; she was at last constrained, in compassion to her people, to hearken to the overtures of peace then made her from France, without relying further on thd vain hopes of gaining more advantageous terms by protracting tlte war a year longer:she had carried it on for some time under that prospect, without reaping the benefits proposed, even at junctures that seemed most favourable to her demands, and to the pretensions of her allies: she had indeed, by that means, raised the glory of her arms; but she could not think this a sufficient recompence for the encreasing miseries of her people; and therefore resolved to lay hold of the opportunity then offered to her, of ending the war by a peace, if it might be obtained upon termsevery way just, safe, and honourable:and those who were then employed in her majesty’s councils, thought themselves obliged to second her good intentions in this case, and to obey her commands with all readiness. The said earl presumes on this occasion to mention to your lordships thd saying of as wise a mao, and as great a general, as the last, age produced, the duke of Parma: When France was in a far lower condition than now, being almost equally divided between two contending parties, and Spain was at the height of its glory, and he himself at the head of a Spanish army supporting one of those parties, after Paris itself had been besieged by the other, it was his opinion (and the advice he gave to his master the king of Spain was grounded upon it ), That,

/ if France were to be got only by reducing it *

‘ iown's, the world would be sooner at an end .* than such a war.’ The queen, seemed, v at this time, with better reason, to frame the like judgment; and it was therefore her pleasure, and a great instance (as the said earl conceives) of her wisdom and goodness, to think of securing a peace, while she appeared able to carry on the war; her armies being full and numerous; and before the exhausted condition of her kingdoms, and the impossibility on her side of maintaining so disproportionate an expence, was discovered by her enemies. At this juncture, the queen entered upon a negociation of peace, with circumstances of great honour to herself: France applying to her first on this account, previously owning her title, and acknowledging the right of the Protestant succession, two chief grounds upon which the declaration of the last war was built. As to the allies, it was conducted in the same manner as all treaties of peace in confederacies have ever, been, and according to the known laws of nations in such cases; the first motion, and the several steps of it as fast as they ripened into proposals fit for consideration, being without delay communicated to the States General. By the terms of this peace, as all reasonable satisfaction and security due to any of the allies by treaty were obtained for them by the queen, and their just pretensions effectually supported, so larger advantages were actually procured for Great Britain in particular, than ever had been demanded before in any treaty or negociation between this and any other foreign state. The said earl craves leave on this occasion to appeal to your lordships, whether all the ends for which the war was entered into have not, by this treaty, been fully attained ? Whether it does not appear, by the best of proofs, experience, that the kingdoms of France and Spain are, by the conventions of this treaty, most effectually separated ? And whether any other expedient could have been so successful to this purpose, as that whereby it is now happily brought about ? Whether the balance of.power in Europe be not now upon a better foot than it has been tor an hundred years past ? Whether the advantages that have accrued to Great Britain by this treaty do not appear; and have not appeared, in the security of the Protestant succession, and in his majesty’s peaceable accession to the throne with the universal applause of his subjects ? In the additions made* to our wealth, by the great quantities of bullion lately coined at the mint, by the vast increase of shipping employed since the peace in the fishery and in merchandize, and by the remarkable.rise of the customs upon import, and of-our manufacture-and the gtowth of our country upon fcxport ? for the proof of which particulars* he refers himself to those officers and books wherein an authentic account of them is com* tained. And as the terms of the peace were, in these and other respects, manifestly profitable to Great Britain; so the said earl begs leave humbly to remind your lordships, tint

207] PARL. HISTORY, 2 GscnteB I.

they were communicated to the parliament, and with their concurrence agreed on; that the peace, thus concluded, was afterwards highly approved by both Houses:that solemn thanks was, rendered to God for it in all our churches, as well as in the churches of the United Provinces: and that her majesty received on this subject the hearty and unfeigned congratulations of her people from all parts of her dominions. . These being the real effects, and this a true representation, of her majesty’s conduct in the affairs both of war and peace; thq said earl sees aot how be or any others then io her majesty’s service can be justly charged with betraying the interest of their own country and of the allies, by negociating and promoting that peace, which then was, and (as he hath good grounds to believe) still continues to be, very acceptable and advantageous to these kingdoms: and if the peace itself be not 'condemned; and if it be not even charged upon the said earl as a crime, that he advised ner maj esty to conclude that peace; neither of which appear to him from the articles; he humbly conceives, it is a particular and extraordinary hardship upon him, that rough draughts and essays towards a peace, with other preliminary steps in a negotiation, all leading to an end which he looks upon to be just and profitable, and which is not in any of the articles alledged to be otherwise, should be branched into so many distinct heads of accusation against him; for, supposing that in the process of so nice and difficult an affair, subject to divers unforeseen obstructions and eveut9, any improper steps had been taken (which the said earl doth not admit, but altogether on his part denies); yet, if things were at last conducted to a right issue, and ended in an honourable and advantageous peace, there can be (as he Conceives) no just ground to find fault with the measures made use of to compass it, because they seemed before the accomplishment to have a different tendency; especially if it he considered, that scarce any peace hath been made by a confederacy, where less occasion was administered for jealousy among the several parties, and less reason given to complain that every nicety required by the letter of such an alliance was not strictly observed: and therefore he humbly hopes, that no steps taken for obtaining a peace approved by the wisdom of former Parliaments, shall by any succeeding Parliament be accounted criminal, unless it can be made appear that those steps were taken contrary to the queen’s orders, or upon corrupt views of private advantage:hut that no charge of this nature can be made good against him, he presumes to affirm with great assurance:nor does he know of any other persons justly chargeable upon either of these accounts’.

that they never attempted to cover their action* from public censure by any pardon or indemnity, 'though they had very good reason to believe that, had they judged or imagined themselves to have wanted such security, it might, 1 through the goodness of the queen, have easily* been obtained; nor can he think it an observation unfit to be made, that, in fewof the article* which concern the negotiations of peace, the* charge is founded on any breach of the laws of Great Britain; but it is in most of them built chiefly on the supposed infraction of certain1 treaties and alliances with foreign prinees and states; and he conceives, that such infraction* of public treaties, where they do nor particular ly affect the interests of Great Britain, being cognizable by the laws of nations enly and not by those of the realm, are not wont to be examined into here at borne, and prosecuted a* criminal; bnt upon the complaint of some prince or state pretending by that means to bd injured, and lodging such complaint, iu some reasonable time, with the prince by the advice of whose ministers and servants such injury is supposed to have been done: but he knows not that any such steps have been taken, since the peace, by any of the powers concerned; on the contrary, he believes, that all the allies, except the emperor and empire, made their peace with the enemy at the same time the queen did; and that none of them did afterwards complain to her majesty (who survived the said peace a year and almost four months) of any hardships imposed upon them in it: that the princes of the empire, who contributed very little to the war, might have concluded their peace upon reasonable terms, at the same time the other allies did; and would probably have done it, if the emperor, on his part, had been willing to sign together with them; which, he is informed, at the- conclusion of any general peace, has been seldom done; and particularly, at the several conclusions of the peace of Munster, that of Nimegben, and that of Reswick, was not pratft tised. And be submits it to your lordships consideration, whether the emperor, having had all reasonable and equitable satisfaction made hint for his pretensions to the' succession of the Spanish monarchy, according to the terms of the grand alliance, could have any just reason to complain of the queen’s ministers, or those of her allies, for concluding a peace without insisting, on his account, upon impossible conditions; especially when no provision was made, or offered to he made, to reimburse to her majesty any part of those vast sums she had already expended in support of his pretensions; whilst he failed of supplying his quota almost in every part of the war, notwithstanding his mew and great acquisitions: but whether the ein-peror, or any other of the allies j had any just ground of complaint or not, still the said Earl presumes to insist, that it ought to have been signified to the queen; who upon such Complaint, had she found any of her servants justly Matnfeable, as disobeying her orders, or misleading her by their advice into unjustifiable anil

dishonourable measures, might have'punished them forthwith, as their offences deserved: but, nothing of this kind having been done, he humbly leaves it to be considered by your lordships, whether the silence of the powers concerned doth not carry in it a Wrong presumption, either that they had no real and just ground of complaint in relation to the terms of the peace itself, or at. least did not look upon the ministers of the queen as any ways liable to blame on that account: and therefore he must again beg leave to express to your lordships his concern, that he should be charged as a criminal, by the laws of this land, for supposed breaches of treaties with foreign states; which never were complained of as such, by those states themselves, during the life of her majesty. He desires further to observe to your lordships, that wherever he is charged with carrying on a private and separate negotiation, it is all along understood with regard only to the States of the United Provinces; no step that was communicated to them being censured upon this account; whereas all the other allies had, by virtue of their treaties with the queen, a like right to a communication of counsels: and her majesty was under no stipulations to act more in concert with any ene, than with all of them. He doth indeed allow it to have been most agreeable to reason, and to the interests of state, that the queen should act in a closer conjunction with Holland than with any other of her allies, because that, next to Great Britain, Holland bore the greatest share in the charge of the war; but then he hopes it will be allowed also, that the States being more interested in the success of the war than England, and that England having submitted to a greater share of the burthen, in order to procure, not only a fitting security for the States, but such as brought great advantages to them, though no benefit toEngland, it was very reasonable for the queen to take care of the interest of her own kingdoms some other way; and, since the advantages she demanded from the enemy were such a&she might obtain without prejudice to the States, it waa as lawful for her to negotiate this matter, without communicating it originally and in the first rise of it, to them, as it was for her and the States to concert their mutual interests together, without the immediate and ex- press participation of the other allies, which, being known to be done without a design to defeat any of the main ends, of the alliance, was never complained of by any of the confederates: and as for the matters concerted previously with France, for the particular interest of England, 'without the original intervention of Holland, the Slatetwere so far from protesting against her majesty's measures, and condemning her conduct in this respect, that their, ministeffr proffered several rimes, in their name, to have led the way in the most difficult part of the whole negotiation, and to have done his utmott to facilitate the conclusion of it, provided his masters might have a share in the Assiento contract and trade to the You VII.

Spanish West Indies; one of those advantages which France had discovered its willingness should be allowed previously and entirely to England.

“ These few general observations the said earl has thought fit to add in the close of his Answer to the several Articles of his Impeachment; not only in his own necessary vindication, but also in defence of her late majesty’s conduct in the negociating and concluding a peace, the perfecting of which she esteemed the greatest happiness of her reign.

“ Upon the review of the Two and Twenty Articles with which he is charged; as he is not conscious of any offence committed by him with respect to any one of them, so it is with a particular concern and surprize that he reflects on those two wherein he is accused of high treason, for endeavouring to procure Tournay to France, and so deprive the States of that intended part of their barrier; and for procuring Spain and the West Indies to the duke of Anjou upon his renunciation of the crown of France, : referring himself to what he has said in his answer to both these articles, he here further assures your lordships, (and thinks it sufficiently known both at home and abroad) that his opinion and endeavour, as oc* casion offered, always were for Tournay’s remaining (as it oow does) to the States General; and as to the latter, he doubts not but that what has lately happened in France, is a convincing proof to your lordships, and to all the world, that the renunciation was the best expedient that could have been proposed, to* wards hindering the two kingdoms from being united under one and the same monarch f that that branch of the treaty which relates to this expedient has fully answered its end, and made good the character given of it by the queen “ that it would execute itselfand therefore, that whoever advised this method of separating the two crowns, was so for from being guilty of any traiterous design, that he cfoinenfly promoted the welfare of Great Britain and the good of Christendom.

“ The said Earl, with all the assuranpes of an innocent man, begs leave to repeat, that, as well in thisras in all other affairs of state, in which be had the honour to be employed by her late majesty, he ever acted, according to the bestof his skill jand judgment, with sincere desires and intentions to serve the public, and without any view to his own private advantage. As he was in several great stations under her majesty, he came into all of them by her own special command, without his seeking or desiring them; and he served her in all with the utmost respect, zeal, and faithfulness; and while he continued in those stations, for many years, it was with great wonder and pleasure that he observed how her majesty’s whole thought^ endeavours, and time, werer divided between her duty to God and her love to her people, whose good and security she preferred always to her own ease, and often hazarded her health and life itself to procured; ty

knew, that the most effectual way for any one to recommend himself to her good opinion, was to act upon the same principles of justice and love to his country that she did:and as she abhorred the thoughts of any thing burthensome or injurious to her people; so she often expressed herself with the greatest satisfaction and delight, when she reflected on the advantages obtained by her for her own subjects, and the quiet and repose she had gained for Europe, by that just and honourable peace, for which, as the present age doth, so generations to come will, bless the memory of that excellent and renowned queen. Oxford/ '

Debate in the .Commons on the Earl of Oxford's Answer to the Articles of .]

September 7. The Lords sent a message to acquaint the Commons, that the earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer had put in his Answer to the Articles of Impeachment; and also to deliver to the House of Commons a true copy thereof. Hereupon the.Commons ordered that the said Answer be read on the Monday following, and the said Answer being then read accordingly, there arose a small debate.

Mr. Robert Walpolet among other things,

. said, He had not yet bad time to peruse and examine that Answer, but that he now heard it read with a great deal of attention, and, in his opinion, it contained little more than what had been suggested in vindication of the late measures, in a pamphlet intituled, “ The Conduct of the Allies, " and repeated over and /Over in the papers called, “ The Examiner." That the main drift of this answer seemed to prove these two assertions, 1. That the earl of Oxford had no sh&re in the advising and managing the matters mentioned in the articles against him, but that the late queen did every thing; and 2. That the late queen was a wise, good, and pious princess. That if the second proposition were not better grounded than the first, the reputation of that excellent princess would be very precarious: but as

every body must own her to have been a good, and pious queen, so it was notorious that the earl of Oxford, as prime minister, was the chief adviser, promoter and manager, of the matters charged upon him in the articles: and therefore his answer was a false and malicious libel, laying upon his royal mistress the blame of all the ernicious measures he had led her into, against er own honour and the good of his country:that he hoped the earl’s endeavouring to screen himself behind the queen’s name, would avail him nothing; That it is indeed, a fundamental maxim of our constitution, That Kings can do no wrong; but that, at the same time, ’tis no less certain, that ministers of state are accountable for their actions; otherwise a parliament would be but an empty n, ame; the Commons would Have no business in that place; and the government would be absolute and arbitrary. That though the earl had the assurance •o aver, that he had no share in the management of affairs that were transacted while he

was at the helm, yet he pretended to justify the late measures: and therefore, in that respect, his answer ought to be looked upon as a libel on the proceedings of the Commons, since endeavoured to clear those persons, who had already confessed their guilt by their flight.

Mr. Shippen could not be altogether silent on this occasion: He said, That it would not become him to defend the earl’s Answer, since, as a member of that honourable assembly, he was become one of his accusers: But that he could not forbear wishing, that this prosecution might be dropt, and that the House would be satisfied with the two late acts of attainder. That this wish of his was the stronger, because one of the principal reasons that induced the Commons to impeach the earl of Oxford, subsisted no longer, the affairs of Europe having received a sudden turn from the death of the French king; whereby the renunciation of king Philip began to take place, in the advancement of the duke of Orleans to the absolute regencj of France.

Mr. Aislaby answered, That he hoped it was to little purpose the gentleman who spoke last, endeavoured to move the pity and compassion of the House, and persuade them to drop this prosecution. That this was not & proper time to examine and reply to the earl of Oxford's Answer; and therefore he would content himself with saying, in general, that it was a contexture of the shifts, evasions, and false representations, contained in the three parts of “ The History of the White-Staff.” That as to what had been suggested concerning the event which seemed to have strengthened the renunciation, be did not deny, there might be something in it; which was manifest from the great joy the well-affected to the government had shewn, on this occasion, and from the mortification and despair that appeared in the faces of a certain party: But that, after all, it could not yet be ascertained, that the renunciation was in force; that there was a vast difference between the regency and the crown; that time only would decide that matter; but that even supposing that, by the concurrence of unforeseen events, king Philip’s renunciation should, at last, take place, yet the same would not justify the ministers who proposed and laid it as the foundation of the late peace, since they with whom they treated, were sof frank and so sincere as to tell them, that it could never be valid, by the fundamental laws of France.

After some other speeches, it was ordered. That the Answer of Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, be referred to the Committee appointed to _draw up Articles of Impeachment and prepare evidence against the impeached lords; and that the said Committee do prepare a Replication to the said Answer. Accordingly on Sept: 16, Mr. Robert Walpole, from the Committee, reported the said Replication, which he read in his place, and afterwards delivered in at the table, where the same was read, agreed unto, and ordered to be engrossed. The Monday after the engrossed Re *

plication was read, and it was ordered, that lord Coningsby do carry the same to the Lords; which his lordship did accordingly.

Replication of the Commons to the Earl of Oxford?* Answer to the Articles of

ment.] The said Replication was as follows:

The COMMONS’ REPLICATION to the . ANSWER of ROBERT Earl of OXFORD and Earl MORTIMER.

“ The Commons have considered the Answer of Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, to the Articles of Impeachment exhibited against him by the knights, citizens, and burgesses, in parliament assembled; and do with astonishment observe, that the said earl, instead of giving a reasonable and pertinent answer to the just and heavy charge 'brought against him by the Commons of Great Britain, has presumed not only to deny his advising and being concerned in any matters of state in the Articles charged against him, though confessed to be done under an administration wherein be was notoriously the first minister and chief director; but has also joined therewith a false and malicious libel, laying upon his royal mistress the blame of every thing, which by imposing upon her, he had effected against her honour and the good of his country, thereby attempting to reflect upon the honour and justice of the House of Commons, and to cast an odium- upon their proceedings against him, as tending to asperse the memory of the late queen. But the Commons are of opinion, that if it were possible to add to the heavy load of guilt in which the treasons and other most flagitious crimes committed by the said earl have already involved him, this base and ungrateful attempt to impute them to his royal mistress must bring such a new weight of infamy upon him, and so justly provoke the indignation of the Commons, that they might think themselves obliged to demand your lord-x ships immediate justice, for this unwarranted attempt'upon the honour of the late queen and the proceedings of parliament.

" But the Commons, being sensible that the treasons and other crime* whereof the earl stands impeached, and the necessity of bringing him to speedy and exemplary justice, require that all occasions ot delay should be avoided; and not doubting that your lordships ^rill, in due time, vindicate the honour of the late queen and of the Commons of Great ' Britain, and the justice of their proceedings:The Commons do aver their charge against the said fearl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, for high treason, and other high crimes and misdeiuea-hors, to be true; and that the said earl is guilty of all and singular the articles and charges therein respectively contained, in such manner as he stands impeached; and that the Commons will be ready to prove their charge against him, at such convenient time as shall be appointed for that purpose.”

The Duke of Ormond and LordRolingbroke’s Names raxed out of the Roll of Peers] Sept. 13. Notice being taken in the House of Lords, u That the names of James Butler, duke of Ormond, and Henry St. John, viscount Bolingbroke, attainted by act of parliament of high treason, unless they rendered themselves to justice by the tenth of this instant September, remain in the Roll of Peers delivered into this House by Garter late King at Arms It is ordered, 1. “ That this House will tomorrow take this matter into consideration; and that the Lords be summoned to attend the service of this House upon that occasion. St. That the Lietenant of the Tower of London, or the de-

E lieutenant of the same, do attend this e tomorrow, to give an account whether James duke of Ormond and Henry viscount Bolingbroke, or either of them, have render* ed him or themselves, according to the form of the acts of parliament for their attainder respectively.”

Sept. 14. Mr. Doyley, deputy lieutenant of the Tower of London, attending according to order. He was called in, and examined, at the bar, whether Jame6 duke of Ormond and Henry viscount Bolingbroke, or either of them, have rendered him or themselves to the lieutenant of the Tower within the time prescribed by the acts for their attainder, respectively. Also the Usher of the Black Rod was examined touching the same. And they severally acquainting the House, “ that neither of them, the said duke of Ormond or viscount Bolingbroke have rendered themselves, according to the acts abovemen tionedIt is ordered, by the Lords spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled, That the Earl Marshal' of England do cause the names of the said James duke of Ormond and Henry viscount Bolingbroke to be razed out of the Roll of Peers, in this House; and likewise out of all books and lists in the 'Herald’s Office, . wherein their or either of their names are inserted.

Sept. 17. The Lord Chancellor acquainted the House, “ That as he came in, Mr. Le Neve, -Norroy king at arms, delivered to his lordship a warrant from the earl of Suffolk, deputy Earl Marshal of England, directing the said Le Neve to raze the names of James duke of Ormond and Henry viscount Bolingbroke out of the Roll of Peers pursuant to the order of the House of the 14th instant.” The said Le Neve was thereupon, by direction 9f the House, called iu; and having, at the table, razed the names of the said James duke of Ormond and Henry viscount Bolingbroke out of the said Roll, he withdrew.

Report of the Committee of Secrecy respecting Mr. Prior.] Sept. 20. Mr. Walpole reported from the Committee appointed to draw up Articles of Impeachment, and to prepare evidence against the impeached lords, to whom it was referred to lay before the House so much as they should think proper of the evidence of Mr. Prior; and also the state and cirfurn-

Stance? of his confineihent; the report which they had directed him to make to the House; which he read in his place, ' and afterwards delivered in at the table; Where the same was read i and is as followeth:vix.

“ That in the perusal and examination of the Several books and papers referred to the Com* tnittee of Secrecy, Mr* Prior appeared, through the whole progress of the separate and pernicious negociations carried on between the ministers of Great Britain and France, to have been principally concerned* as an agent and instrument of those evil and traiterous counsellors, some of which are already attainted, and others stattd impeached* of high treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanors:and the Committee Conceiving there were matters contained in the first general report, from which crimes of a very' high nature might be justly charged and imputed to the said Mr. Prior, whenever the House should think proper to enter into that consideration; as likewise, that Mr. Prior was able to give grea't lights into all those dark and secret transactions, when he should be called Op on by the great council of the nation, or any committee appointed by them, to give an account of the negociations in which he was concerned as a public minister; the House, Upon a motion from the committee for that purpose, was pleased to otder, before the report was made, That Mr. Prior should be taken into custody of the serjeant at arms, to prevent his making his escape upon notice of w hat was contained in the report:

“That this method of confining Mr. Prior is not only agreeable to former precedents upon the like occasions, but necessary, and essential to that great duty and privilege of the House of Commons of redressing grievances, and bringing great offenders to justice.

“ That the committee did, some time after, pursuant to the powers given them by the House, proceed to examine Mr. Prior concerning several matters, of which there can lie no doubt but he was fully apprised, and acquainted with, in which examination, Mr. Prior 'did behave himself with such contempt*of the authority of parliament, and prevaricate in so gross a manner, as most justly to deserve the highest displeasure of the House:

“ But finding at last, after an examination of several hours, that it was impossible for him to disguise, or conceal, some facts that were before the committee, he was induced to declare upon oath, some truths, which will be very material evidence upon the trials of the impeached lords i

“ And the committee, having notice, that Mr. Prior had, during his first confinement, met, and conferred with the earl of Oxford, and his nearest relations and dependents, which Mr, Prior confessed to be. true, thought it their duty to move the House, that Mr. Prior might be committed to closer custody.

“ From this short state of the proceedings relating to Mr. Prior, the Committee submits it to the wisdom of the' House, whether his be-

haviour has so far merited the favour and mercy of the House, as to make that confinement^ more easy to him, which his contempt of tbtf Commons of Great Britain, and his notorious prevarication, most justly brought him into s And it seems worthy of consideration, bow far it may be thought advisable for the House of Commons to set at liberty a person in their custody, and committed, according to the an* cient methods and practice of parliament, who is a material evidence against high offenders, under prosecution of the Commons of Great Britain; and who, there is great reason to apprehend, would immediately withdraw himself, and as far as in him lay, defeat the justice of the nation/ ’

Ordered, That the Committee appointed to draw up Articles of Impeachment, and to prepare evidence, against the impeached lords, be' impowered to sit, notwithstanding any adjournment of the House.

Sir W. Wyndham, sir John Packington, Mr Ed. Harvey, Mr. F, Mr. Mr. C. Kynaston, ordered at the King's re-

quest, to be apprehended.'] Sept. 21. Mr. Secretary Stanhope acquainted the Commons, That he was commanded by the King to com *, municate to the House, That his majesty having just cause to suspect, that sir Williant Wyndham, sir John Packington, Mr. Edward Harvey, Mr. Foster, Mr. Aostis and Mr. Corbet Kynaston, are engaged in a design to Support the intended Invasion of this kingdom, hath'given order for apprehending them; and his majesty desires the consent of this House to his causing them to be committed and detained, if he shall judge it necessary so to do, in pursuance of the late act of parliament for im* powering his majesty to commit and detain such persons as his majesty shall silspect are con* spiring against his person and government. Hereupon it was resolved, nem. con. “ That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, returning the thanks of this House for his gracious message this day, and for his tender re* gard to the privileges of this House; and to desire, that he will be pleased to give orders for the eommitting ana detaining the several members named in the said message, pursuant to the act of this sessions of parliament for that purpose.” *

* “ (Jpon this, warrants were issued out for apprehending the six members, two of whom, Harvey and Anstis, happening to be in town, were immediately secured. Mr. Harvey stabbed himself some few days after with a knife, in two or three places of his breast; but the wounds proved not mortal. As to the rest, Mr. Forster standout in defiance of justice, and with two Romish lords raised a rebellion in Northumberland. Sir John Packington was brought up to London from his house in Worcestershire, and being examined before the council, and nothing appearing against him, was honourably discharged. Mr. Kyaastea

sent a message to acquaint the Commons, Thqt their lordships having addressed his mans ade his escape; and colonel Huske, a cap-thin in the foot-guards, was sent down with a messenger to apprehend sir William Wyndham, at his house in Somersetshire, where they arrived, between four and five in the morning. The door being opened, they appeared to be in haste to see sir William; but the porter told them, he was in bed, and could not yet be spoke with. The colonel told him, be came express, and the person With him had a packet of letters of such consequence, that his master most needs be immediately informed of it. This convinced the man, -and sir William presently leaped out of bed, and came in his gown to the colonel, who told him, he was his prisoner, the messenger, at the same time, shewing the badge of his office. Sir William said, he readily submitted, but desired no noise might be made to frighten his lady, who was with child. Then they entered a chamber, where the colonel seeing sir William's coat and waiscoat lie, told him, he had orders to seise all his papers; and that he most take leave to search his pockets, wherein he found a bundle of papers, which he secured. Sir William would have diverted him, by offering him very frankly the keys of his escrutoire, to search; but the colonel happened to seeure the most important papers, as he bad reason to gness, by the great disorder and confusion in sir Wilr liana’s looks, when he took the bundle out of his waistcoat pocket. Sir William desired the colonel to stay till seven o’clock, and he would order his own coach and six horses to be ready, which would carry them all; telling the colonel, lie would only go in, and put on his cloaths, and take leave of his lady, ana then would wait on him. Out of defereoce to that lady’s noble relations, who, besides their high rank, bad deserved it by their zeal and affection for the present government, the colonel had particular directions to use him with decorum, and readily complied with his request, looking on it as his parole to return: but be soon round himself mistaken in the person, whose honour he hud trusted to; for, though the colonel had caused two doors of sir William’s bed-chamber to be secured, yet. there being a third, he made his escape through it. The colonel, having directed the messenger to stay at the house till further orders, returned with speed to London, to acquaint the government with what had passed; whereupon the King id council thought fit to sign a proclamation, with a reward of 1,000l. for apprehending sir William.

“ One of the papers found in sir William's pocket was said to be a list of the principal persons, who had joined in an association to favour an Invasion, and to advance the Pretender to the throne; which association was transmitted to him by the lord Lansdown.

torious jacobites, who by this time hud got together at Bath, in order to bead the intended (insurrection in Somersetshire, were extremely alarmed at the coming down of the King’s messengers, and left that place with great precipitation, in a very stormy night. Sir William Wyndham, being pursued by the proclamation, and several messengers, thought a clergyman’s habit the best disguise, and ordered one of his servants to write a letter to a gentleman an Surrey, desiring him to give his master refuge in. his house; or, if he would not venture so far, to get him u lodging in the minister’s house, where he would come in a habit, that would bespeak him respect from a clergyman. This letter being brought to the gentleman’s bouse while he was abroad, his lady Opened it; and bong frightened with the thought of the danger, which her husband might incur in harbouring a person charged with treason, she thought fit to send it to the earl of Aylesford, who failed not immediately to communicate if to the government. Sir William rightly judging, by, the miscarriage of the letter, that he could hardly escape, thought it prudent to surrender himself. In order to which, 1 having crossed the Tliarati near Thistleworth, he went first to Sion-house, belonging to the duke of Somerset, his father* in-law, and, coming from thence to London the 3d of October, he put himself into the hands of the earl of Hertford, his brother-in-law, captain of one of the troops of Hfe-goards; who having given notice of it to Mr. Secretary Stanhope, a messenger was sent to take sir WilliaM into custody. Three days after, he was examined at the council board, where be flatly denied he knew any thing of a plot. However, an order was made for his commitment to the Tower. It was then strongly reported, the duke of Somerset offered to be his bail; which the council did not think fit to accept. Bat whether the duke bore this denial impatiently, and expressed some resentment upon it too warmly, it is cettain, he was removed from his place of Master of the Horse.” Tindat.

“ The following anecdote, relating to the arrest i if sir William Wyndham, places lord Towmhead’s firmness of character m a conspicuous point of view. It was communicated to me by his grandson lord Sydney. When the intelligence that sir William Wyndham was concerned in a projected rising in favour of the Pretender, was laid before the cabinet, the duke of Somerset, anxious that his son-in-law, sir William Wyndham, should not be taken into custody, offered to be responsible for him. The ministers were inclined to give way, for fear of offending a person of the duke’s consequence, who, besides his situation of Master of the Hofoe, had great influence with the Whigs. The king was present. The proofs against sir William Wyndham were so strong^that lord Townshend

The Speaker's Speech to the King, on presenting the Money Bills.] The same day, the king went to the House of Peers, and the 'Commons attending, the Speaker, upon presenting the Money Bills, made the following Speech to his majesty:

“ Most gracious Sovereign;

“ Your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal sub* jects, the knights, citizens, and burgesses in parliament assembled, have now finished the supplies granted to your majesty for the service of this present year. Your Commons had much sooner offered these supplies to your majesty, had not their zeal for your majesty’s service, and the duty they owe to their country, led them into inquiries.which have drawn this session to an unusual length.

“ But your Commons could not see, without the utmost indignation, the glories of her late majesty’s feign tarnished by a treacherous cessation of arms; the faith of treaties violated, that ancient probity, for which the English nation had been justly renowned throughout all ages, exposed to scorn and contempt; and the trade of the kingdom given up by insidious and precarious treaties of commerce, whilst the people, amused with new worlds explored, were contented to see the most advantageous branches of their commerce in Europe lost, or betrayed.

. liSuch was the condition of this kingdom, when it pleased the divine Providence to call your majesty to the throne of your ancestors, under whose auspicious reign your Commons with pleasure beheld the glories of the Plan-tagenets (your majesty’s royal ancestors) revive; and have an unbounded prospect of the continuance of this happiness, even to the latest posterity, in a race of princes lineally descended from your majesty.

“ And that nothing might be wanting on the part of your Commons, to establish your majesty’s throne on solid and lasting foundations, they have applied themselves, with unwearied diligence, to vindicate the honour of the British nation, and to restore a mutual confidence between this kingdom and its ancient and faithful

“ It was not to be expected, but that the enemies to the nation’s peace, would use their utmost endeavours to obstruct your Commons in these inquiries; but despairing of any success in the representative body of the kingdom, they fomented tumults among the drtegs of the people at home, and spirited up the Pretender to an Invasion from abroad. This gave your faithful Commons fresh opportunities of shewing their affection to your majesty’s person, and their fidelity to your government, by their unanimous concurrence in granting such supplies as were sufficient to disappoint the one, and by their passing such laws as were necessary to suppress the other; and, in every respect, to express their abhorrence of a popish Pretender, concerning whom, nothing remains unsuspected but his bigotry to superstition, and his hatred to our holy religion; for the advancements of which your majesty has expressed your pious care, by recommending to your Commons the providing maintenance for the ministers, who are to officiate in the new churches. This your Commons readily complied with, trusting, that the prayers there offered to the Almighty, will bring down a blessing on all your majesty’s undertakings and not doubting, but that the doctrines there taught, will be a means to secure the quiet of your kingdoms, and the obedience of your people.

“ The revenue set apart for the uses of the civil government, your Commons found so much intangled with mortgages and anticipations, that what remained, was far from being sufficient to support the honour and dignity of the crown: this your Commons took into serious consideration, and being truly sensible, that on your majesty’s greatness the happiness of your subjects entirely depends, they have put the civil revenues into the same state, in which they were granted to your majesty’s glorious predecessor, king William, of immortal memory:and thereby enabled your majesty to make an ample provision for the Prince of Wales, whose heroic virtues are the best security of your majesty’s throne, as his other personal endowments are the joy of all your faithful subjects.

“ I should but ill discharge the trust reposed in me by the Commons, did I not lay before your majesty, with what cheerfulness they received your majesty’s gracious intentions for her royal highness the Princess; and with how much readiness and unanimity they enabled your majesty to settle a revenue suitable to the dignity of a princess, whose piety, and steady adherence to the Protestant Religion, is the glory of the present age, and will be the admiration of all futur^ generations.

May it please yoijr majesty; The bills which the Commons have prepared to complete the supplies for this year’s service, and for the

* new ChufcheSj&c.’ Which they with all humility now .present, to your majesty for your royal assent.”

After this, his majesty gave the royal assent to the three Bills before mentioned, as also to six more public, and to nine private bills.

The Kings Speech at the .] Then

bis majesty was pleased to declare from the throne, that he had ordered the Lord Chancellor to deliver his majesty’s Speech to both houses of parliament, in his majesty’s name and words, which he did accordingly, as follows

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

4t I am persuaded you are all by this time very desirous of some recess, and that it cannot be deferred longer, without great inconvenience to your private affairs.

“ But before I part with you, I must return you my most sincere thanks for your having finished, with so much wisdom and unanimity, what I recommended to your care; and particularly I must thank you, gentlemen of the House of Commons, for the provision you have made, as well for the support of the honour and dignity of the crown, as for the other necessary occasions of the public; especially for your having done it by means so little burthensome to ray people; which, I assure you, recommends the supplies to me above any other circumstance whatsoever.

My Lords and Gentlemen;

4t The open and declared rebellion, which is now actually begun in Scotland, must convince ail, who do not wish to see us givep up into the hands of a popish Pretender, of the dangers to which we have been, and are still exposed.

“ I thought it incumbent upon me, to give you the earliest notice of the designs of our enemies, and I cannot sufficiently commend the seal and dispatch with which you impowered me, at a time when the nation was in so naked and defenceless a condition, to make such preparations as I should think necessary for our security. You shall have no reason to repent of the trust and confidence you repose in me, which I shall never use to any other end than for the protection and welfare of my people.

41 It was source to be imagined, that any of my protestant subjects, who have known and enjoyed the benefits of our excellent constitution, and have heard of the great dangers they were wonderfully delivered from by the frnppy Revolution, should, by any arts and management, be drawn into measures that must at once destroy their religion and liberties, and subject them to popery and arbitrary power; but such has been our misfortune, that too many of my people have been deluded, and made instrumental to the Pretender’s designs, who bad cevcr dared to think of in-

vading us, or raising a rebellion, had he not been encouraged by the success his emissaries and adherents have already had in stirring up riots and tumults, and by the farther hopes they entertain for raising insurrections in many parts of my kingdoms.

“ The endeavouring to persuade my people, that the church of England is in danger underr my government, has- been the main artifice employed in carrying on this wicked and traitorous design. This insinuation, after the solemn assurances I have given, and my having laid hold on all opportunities, to do every thing that may tend to the advantage of the church of England, is both unjukt and ungrateful: Nor can I believe so groundless and malicious a calumny can make any impression upon the minds of my faithful subjects, or that they can be so far misled as to think the church of England is to be secured by setting a popish Pretender on the throne.

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

44 The proofs this parliament has giveh of their unshaken duty and affection to me, and of their love and zeal for the interest of their country, will recommend you to the good opinion and esteem of all who have their religion and liberty truly at heart, and has laid a lasting obligation upon me; and I question not, but by your farther assistance in the several countries to which you are going, with the blessing of Almighty God, who has so frequently interposed in favour of this nation, ' I shall be able to disappoint and defeat the designs of our enemies.

“ Our meeting again to do business early in the next winter will be useful on many accounts; particularly, that the sitting of parliaments may be again brought into that season of the year which is most convenient, and that as little delay may be given as is possible to your judicial proceedings: And I shall, at present, give such orders to my Lord Chancellor, as may not put it long out of my power to meet you, on any sudden occasion.”

Then the Lord Chancellor, having received directions from his majesty, returned to his place; and said,

“ My lords and gentlemen; It is his majesty’s royal will and pleasure, that both Houses should forthwith severally adjourn themselves to Thursday the 6th of October next.”

October 6. The parliament being met at Westminster pursuant to their last adjournment, Mr. Secretary Stanhope acquainted the House, That it was the King’s pleasure, that the parliament should be adjourned for a fortnight; and therefore desired that the House would adjourn itself until the 20th of October; which the House did accordingly.

October 20. Mr. Secretary Stanhope acquainted the House with his majesty’s pleasure, that the parliament be adjourned uutil the 5th of November. Upon which the Commons adjourned themselves to that day, and afterwards to November 21st, and then to Decern? "ber 14, at his majesty’s desire.

The Commons ordered, That sir Edward Nor they be added to the Commit-, tee of Secrecy, in the room of sir Richard Onslow, bart. who had accept^ the place of one of the tellers of his majesty’s exchequer, and was not rechosen. It was ordered likewise, That Mr. Speaker do write circular letters to alj the Sheriffs of the kingdom, to summon , the members in their respective counties to attend the service of the House upon the 9th of January < After which Mr. Secretary Stanhope acquainted the House, that he bad a message from his majesty to this House, signed by his majesty, which he delivered to Mr. Speaker, as follows, vis.

“ G. R.

u His majesty understanding, that many, both of the House of Lords and Commons, are detained in the country, as well by their private as the public business; and the holidays being now so near, during which there is usually a recess, it is his majesty’s pleasure, that the parliament adjourn to Monday the 9th day of January next, at which time his majesty intends the parliament shall sit to do business.”

Then the House accordingly adjourned till Monday the 9th of January.

The King's Speech to both Houses respecting the Rebellion.] January 9, 1716. The Parliament being met at Westminster, the king went to the House of Peers, and the Commons be* ing sent lor up, and attending, the lord Chancellor read his majesty’s Speech to both Houses, #• follows e

et My Lords and Gentlemen;

°The zeal and affection to my government, and the vigilant care for the Safety of the nation, which yau have shewn in your respective counties, have not only fully answered my expectations, but give me assurances that you are met together resolved to aql with a spirit, becoming a time of common danger, and with such a vigour, as will end in the confusion of all those who have openly engaged in this Rebellion, qn4 in the shame and repreach of such ns by secret and malicious insinuations, have fomented, or by an avowed indifference encouraged this traiteroua enterprise.

M It is, I dpubt not, a great satisfaction to you to have observed, that the powers yon entrusted me with for the preservation of the public safety, have been employed in the most proper and effectual manner, and made strictly Subservient to those purposes only for which yon intended them; and you must have had the pleasure to reflect with nve> that as the measures .taken for our defence, have been just and necessary, so it has pleased the divine Providence to bless them with a series of suitable success: and I cannot but. take this opportunity of doing justice to. the officers and soldiers of the army, whose braye and faithful discharge of their duty, has disappointed our enemies, and contributed sp much to them&ty of the nation.

“ I did hope, that the detecting and preventing the designed insurrections in some parts of the kingdom, and the defeating, ia others, those who had taken up arms against me, would have put an end to this rebellion; but it is plain that our enemies, animated by some secret hopes of assistance, are still endeavouring to support this desperate undertaking; and the Pretender, as I have reason to believe, is now landed in Scotland.

“ It is however with pleasure I can acquaint you, that notwithstanding these intestine commotions, Great Britain has, in some measure, recovered its influence and reputation abroad. The treaty for setting the barrier, for the Netherlands is now fully concluded between the emperor and the States General, under my guaranty:the king of Spain has agreed to a treaty, by which that valuable branch of our commerce will be delivered from the new impositions and hardships, to which it was subjected by the late treaties; and will stand settled, for the future, on a foot more advantageous and certain than it ever did in the most flourishing time of any of my predecessors; and the treaty for renewing all former alliances between the crown of Great Britain and the States General is brought very near to its conclusion.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons;

“ I must rely on your affection to me, and your care and concern for the safety of the nation, to grant me such supplies as may enable me to restore, and to secure, the peace of the kingdom; and I will order estimates of the necessary expences to be laid.before you...

“ Among the many unavoidable ill consequences of this rebellion, none affects me more sensibly than that extraordinary burden, which it has and must create to my faithful subjects, : to ease them as far as lies in my power, I take this first opportunity of declaring, That I will freely give up all.the estates that shall become forfeited to the crown by this rebellion, to be applied towards defraying the extraordinary expence incurred on this occasion.

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

“ It is a matter of the greatest uneasiness to me, that the first yean of my reign, the whole course of which I wished to have transmitted to posterity, distinguished by the fair and endearing marks of peace and clemency, should be clouded and overcast with so unnatural a rebellion; which, however inpotent and unsuccessful a due care may reoder it in all other respects, does most sensibly afflict me, by the calamities it has brought on many of my faithful subjects, and' by those indispensable returns of severity, which their sufferings, and the public safety, do most justly cull for. Under this concern, my greatest comfort is, that I cannot reproach myself with having given the least provocation to that spirit of discontent and calumny that has been let loose. against Hie; or at least the pretence for kindling the flame of this Rebellion,

“ Let those, whose fatal counsels laid the

foundation ef all these mischiefs! and those whose private discontents and disappointments, disguised under false pretences, have betrayed great numbers of deluded people into their own destruction, answer for the miseries In which they have involved their fellow-subjects. I question not, but that, with the continuance of God’s blessing, who alone Is able to form good out of evil, and with the cheerful assistance of my parliament, we shall, in a abort time, see this rebellion end, not only in restoring the tranquillity of my government, but in procuring a firm and lasting establishment of that excellent constitution in church and state* which it was manifestly designed to subvert; and that this open and flagrant attempt in favour of Popery, will abolish all other distinctions among us, but of such as are zealous - asseftors of the liberties of their* country, the present establishment, and the Protestant religion, and of such as are endeavouring to subject the nation to the revenge and tyranny of St Popish Pretender."

The Lords' Address .] The Lords

•greed upon the following Address;

uMost Gracious Sovereign;

" We, your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled, do return our most un-, feigned thanks to your majesty, for your most gracious speech from the throne; and do, with great joy, lay hold of this opportunity to congratulate your majesty on the successes with which it has pleased Almighty God to bless your majesty's arms and counsels, agaiu9t the rebels., '

> “ We are so truly sensible of the happiness which the nation enjoys under your majesty’s government, that we should be wanting to eur own interest, as well as to the duty we owe to your majesty, did we not exert ourselves with the utmost spirit and vigour in the present time of danger to the confusion of all such as are -either actors or abettors in the present wicked and unnatural rebellion, and to the reproach of those who affect to appear lukewarm or indifferent in the cause of their king and country.

“ Our satisfaction, in observing the just and wise use of that power with which the parliament entrusted your majesty in this great conjuncture, can be equalled by nothing but our joy for those remarkable sucGessfes which have been the natural consequences of it.

" We cannot sufficiently praise the fidelity •nd bravery which your army have shewn on this' occasion; and assure ourselves, ^that all your faithful subjects, who are influenced by the same principles of honour and duty, will lie as active, in their several stations, to promote the service of your majesty, and the •afety of the public.

u The landing of the Pretender in Scotland will only serve to animate this oar zeal for your majesty; and we doubt not but it will prove his

Vql. VIL I

last effort for disturbing the peace1 of your majesty's reign.

“ We are highly sensible of jhe security and honour which redounds to the nation, by the treaty for settling the barrier in the Netherlands under your majesty's guarranty; and of the advantages which will accrue to your subjects, by the treaty of commerce with Spain; and by the negociations which are now on foot* for the renewing of all .alliances with the ancient and faithful friends of this kingdom, the States General.

“ It is with equal pleasure and astonishment, that we see your majesty has been able, in a time of intestine troubles, to recover, in a great measure, the reputation and commerce of the British nation; and that you have gained more advantageous terms of trade for your subjects, than what were procured by any of your royal predecessors, who had so much fairer opportunities of demanding them.

« We want words to express our gratitude to your majesty for your gracious and ^paralleled resolution, to give up all the estates, that shall become forfeited by the rebellion, to the use of the public:and promise ourselves that all your faithful subjects, will, with great cheerfulness, do their part towards enabling you to restore and secure the peace of the kingdom, to which your majesty contributes in so generous a manner, out of the profits inherent to your crown and royal dignity.

“ That endearing tenderness and clemency, which your majesty expresses towards all your subjects, very much aggravates the guilt of those, who have taken up arms, against so good and gracious a sovereign; and we cannot think, without the utmost horror, of those who rebel against a prince of so much goodness, or spread falshoods and calumnies against your sacred persoD, at the same time that you are studyitig to advance their welfare and happiness.

“ We cannot desire a greater instance ofthi* your majesty’s affection to your people, than the sense which your majesty expresses of those, whose evil counsels laid the foundation of all our mischiefs, and whose self interested (views, have deluded stich numbers of unwary men into their own destruction.

- “We heartily pray Almighty God, 4hat he may grant your majesty a long and happy reign over us, and bless your endeavours with success, for the procuring of a firmand'lasting establishment of onr excellent constitution in Church and State. And as we shall always oppose the attempts of such men, as would subject the nation to the revenge and tyranny of a popish Pretender; so we shall always value beyond any honours or titles we can enjoy, the character of being faithful subjects to your majesty, zealous assertors of the liberties of our country, the present establishment, and the Protestant Religion."

The King's Answer.] January 11. The King returned the following Answer thereto:

“ My Lords:

I depend entirely upon the 6s-, »uranees you give me; and. shall ever Steadily pursue such measures, as may best support the constitution in church and state; afld I doubt not but, by the blessing of God, and four assistance, I shall defeat the designs bar enemies.”

Mr. Lechmere’s Speech for an Impeachment of the "Rebel Lords.] The Commons being returned to their House, and, having unanimously resolved on an Address of Thanks to his majesty sent to the Lords to desire them to continue sitting for some time. This Message was carried by

Mr. Lechmere, who having reported to the y House, that the Lords conaentedtodo so, made a speech to the following effect:

“ That after the general assurances the House bad given to his majesty, one moment ought not to be lost, without taking some effectual s(ep. towards making them good:that the. first and great concern was, to pot an end to this rebellion:not only to quiet the present commotoooos, bdt to extinguish the very possibility of their being renewed; that for these ends 1 every gentleman would agree to strengthen the bands of the king m such a manner, as would enable him speedily and effectually to complete this work:that the House wbdid do this with absolute cheerfulness, from the certain knowledge and experience they had of the wisdom and justice of his majesty, who would make no other use of any confidence his parliament should repose in mm, than to promote the common welfare of his pbople; and that whatever extraordinary aseistaace the present juncture of affairs should require, would be -continued tvo longer than the public necessity called for: tfiat the next useful and necessary step, was the national justice, which was incumbent on this bouse, in duty to the king, as well as in justice to the people:and as ungrateful and disagreeable a part as this must be, -yet, when the design of the enemy was become so desperate, and so avowed, as to strike at the crown upon the king’s, head, and to involve the nation in the calamities of a civil war, the House could not exert themselves too early, nor with too much vigour; and that as the House acquitted itself on this occasion, he promised himself the effect would be answerable: that the spirit which should heshewn in this instance, would animate the friends of the government, both.nt home and abroad; and the terror it must strike on our enemies, would be equal at least, and contribute as much to the common safety, as any other preparation that had or could be made. He wished he could say or think, that this rebellion was the project of these only, who appeared to head it; or that it was the result of the weak or rash counsels of those who publicly avowed it: he wished he could say, that it was the work of Papists only, or of those protestants who went wicked or weak enaugh-opwly

to join in it. He wished he could say, «bat R was a plot hut of yoterday, and that it had taken -no deeper foot than ordinary appear* anoes would lead to suspect; but he thought it plain, that it was the effect of many years* hour, of the joint wnd united labour of great numbers, both protestantsand papists, thepferiw and necessary consequence of the neasfcftfe which had been carrying oa for some yfeafift last: that to frame a right judgment of the nature of this rebellion, he thought it necessary fbt the House to look back, and consider the «fc *

years, and the connection they bote with tbd present unfoitanatestateof things:when menirt sacred functions suffered themselves to become state instruments, and the great merit of such men was, under the pretenceofasserting thedoctrines of the church of-England, to condemn the Resolution, be Could never understand any other design or tendency from those practiced, than to undermine the foundation of the‘Protestant sue* cession. He remembered it was said upon 6 very -solemn occasion, by a very honourable gentleman, ‘ That the condemning the late hap- py Revolution, could have no other meaning,

1 than to make way for anotherTbatboVfrever wicked and dangerous these practice* were, they made too great an impression, and cob* tributed a gffeSt deal to the present calamity i that as the designs of the enemy grew inert avowed, state-principles of another kind were advanced, which still conduced to the same end: that it was well known what industry was used to inculcate the notions of hereditary right to the crown, in opposition to the settlement which:, had been made of it in the bouse of HanOvCt^ by the authority of Parliament, and with no other view, than to weaken that settlements that every one remembered what extraordinary pains were taken to poison the people with tbit dangerous notion; mad that those who mad* the best court to men in power, were such who espoused this opinion m the most notorious manner: that he could not forget with what tenderness a certain divine of the church of England was treated below stairs, Whilst under prosecution for the most impudent libel [M The “ Hereditary Right asserted, ” &c.] that ever waft published against any government, that had either will or power to maintain itself. £Ie thought the punishment that was inflicted on that gentleman light enough, but he could not avoid taking notice of a remarkable passage, which then alarmed every thinking man, and will, one time or other, deserve the consideration of this House, viz. the Order from the government, countersigned by a secretary of state, to the judges of the Queen’s Bench, after the judgment passed, to supersede the ignominious part of the punishment, by reason of the sacred function of the criminal; by which the most unexampled and dangerous distinction was introduced; and which proceeding could bear no other construction, than as a license and protection, even from the government, to men in holy orders, tq propagate that destructive peri Wo *

vrith impunity; and the character of (ha per- SOU, which ought in. justice to have aggravated his guilt, and heightened the punishment, became his indemnity aganist the reproach of it, even by the authority of the government itself. He remembered in wh, at manner every thing of (hat nature was treated in Wesminster-hall; what severities were exercised against those persons who had courage enough to assert the interest of their country, apd of the Protestant succession, at the same time that the patrons ojf hereditary right enjoyed ah indulgences: (hat he mentioned these things oi> no uncertainties, having beep an eye-witness of (hem himself, and it paving fallen to his phgfe to bear sonie part in them: that this was ope of thp most successful parts of the scheme of t jiose who had fixed their eytes on the Pretender: that the House need not be told ppw far it had operated to the prejudice of the Protestant succession. That he could give tunny other instances of this hind; all which promoted the same end. The gross distinctions that were coined to elude the oaths that had been made for the security of the government; the endeavours that were used to possess the people with false fears of the danger of the Church; and the little cere that was taken, to spy no worse of it, to instil info the youth of the •kingdom> such principles as were consistent with the true interest either of Church or State. The1 he looked upon these, things which he had mentioned* tc be the foundation of the scheme that yms now, by this Rebellion, carrying on into execution j and ke owned, that in this respect, the authors of it were wise in their generation i for by these arfo* the very principle on which the Protestant succession is founded, was shaken; and though the methods of doing it ipCfe base and vile, yet the dissatisfaction and Uneasiness that was created by them ie the jmnds of the people, made way for the change that was desired. That he craved leave of the 'House, to put them in mmd of other parts of this scheme, that was carrying on at the same jtune- The enemies to the present government judging aright for their own purpose, by all methods to attack the consciences of the people, A& to the legality and justice of the settlement #f the crown in the, bouse of Hanover, they thonyht it necessary, at the same time, to di»* able, as for as they could, those persons who had bpeu, most remarkable for their services in the jUpport of it. That the great effort was made at that great man, [the duke of Marlborough] .who is opt only the honour and ornament of his .country, foit the gfory of the age he lives ip. He added, he thought he shpppld not be suspected of flattery at this, time, nor, as he believed, at aqy time, wi|h respect tq that great map. That pumy who then heard him, remembered 4bf part he took in yindication of that great mpn, whilst his character was under debate in /ftW$ tjoufe. That he could not fotget the rage •ftn4 fnvet^rscy with which he was pursued; awr haw much strew was laid upon obtaining ihfi CCDSUfiSl of PfllliMMlit nn/in Kim fchnt thft

aspersions then thrown upon him, did not hurl that great man; and whatever endeavours may at any time be used to lessen him, will hurt none hql those that shall promote them; but yet those vqin endeavours were a very useful part of the scheme then carrying on. < It was a necessary Step for those men to put him out of the way, whose very name and appearance, at that time, would have been sufficient to raise armies in, favour of the Protestant succession, and the liberties of his country: but he could not bu| observe, that as serviceable as it was for the measures of these men. to wound his character, it was now a reproach to the kingdom, ’that those groundless aspersions, which had been cast upon him, should remain upon the journals of the Parliament. That another (peat ford, [the lord viscount Tqwnshend] foil under the vior fonce of those times, whose prosecution was attended with uncommon fury. That himself had some share fo justifying that great man in this House, when he was voted an enemy to his country. That he observed at that time, and > the event has made it evident, that the Barrier was but the pretence, and the great services he had done tq the Protestant succession, wqs the true provocation which drew that rage upon him. That two other honourable gentlemen, [Mr. Secretary Stanhope and Mr. R. Walpole theu sitting near him, ] had felt the severity of those times; they had distinguished themselves by their zeal and firmness ta the true interest of thefo country, and were tq© considerable to escape the malice of those who had other views. That those proceedings, how nor certain soever the design of them might appear while they w* transacting, have been sufficiently explained by what has followed* Tfiat the name of that general, for whose ins-mediate service the great man first mentioned, was blemished, and for whom there was vanity enough to make him his rival, is now become the reproach of fiis family and country: He avows the service of the Pretender, and ere long we may bear of him at the head of an expedition for establishing Popery and arbitrary power. That the secretary of state, who dif-tiaguiahed himself in the pursuit, of the other great lord, has sufficiently explained his designs to the whole world; and thepeat tidings that we may expect from abroad, is, th«t he has taken upon him the character of a minister tp the Pretender. That he looked upon tho, disabling the great assertera of the Protestant interest, to be a second, and no small part of the scheme; and while these things were carrying on, tfieir little engines and tools were carrying on their work in Westminster-baU. That every man who favoured the Hanover succession, was to he wosrind, and all open and scandalous assertera of contrary principles, were treated with all the care and tenderness of friends.

Selves in that respect. That he would not then trouble the House auy more upon that head, having some thoughts, ere long, to present them with a small collection of things of that kind, for their serious consideration. That the master-strokes of this grand scheme, were yet behind: That the surest way to destroy the ^government, has been always thought to be by "its own hands, that is, by the authority and power of parliament. For this purpose a confederacy, by which the liberties of Europe had been so long sustained against the power of France, was broke to pieces by votes that were /'obtained in this House in the most extraordinary manner. That the honour of the nation, the balance of power, and the Protestant in-teiest in Europe, were effectually given up in’the negociations and conclusion of the peace, by which France was restored to its ancient and formidable state; and every body remembered how near they were, by the same influences, to have given up the whole trade of the nation, to the interest of the French king, who, after that, bad no suitable return left for him to make for such services, but to bestow apon them a Pretender, bred up in his own fjaitb, and in his own politics. That nothing could have obstructed this, but the many miraculous Providences that immediately followed, when his power throughout Europe was un-contestible; and, by the measures that had been taken, the Protestant succession had scarce a friend left in the world. That the king's accession to the throne, accompanied by so many providential circumstances, as it disappointed the immediate execution of the scheme, so it quieted the spirit of those men for some .time. That if the House would make a right judgment of the present Rebellion, they must compare the steps that immediately preceded it, with those that were taken in the last reign, when the hope was to have brought about the same end without a stroke. That the same endeavours soon apepared to propagate the same principles, both in church and state; and those endeavours, though at first not so open, were yet as restless to create dissatisfaction against his majesty’s government, as they had been before to prevent its taking place.. As the encouragement grew stronger, tumults and riots were universally fomented; and it was well known from what quarter they rose, and against iwhom they were levelled; but yet no one instance has been assigned, throughout his administration, that could offend or provoke any but a Jacobite spirit. That his majesty has done more for the honour of the church, and the true* interest of his kingdom, than any of his . predecessors, in three tinies the number of years That his personal virtues, and the wisdom and steadiness of his government have retrieved the honour and reputation of his kingdoms, which had been so shamefully lost: That his weight and influence abroad, and the credit he has obtained in all the known parts of the world have already procured the settlement of the matters iu difference between the two chief

i powers of Europe, from whom alone we can expect assistance in times of danger. That no single instance can be assigned of hardship or oppression to any one of his subjects, or that can give a just reason of dissatisfaction; hut on the contrary, those who have shewn the greatest aversion to his government, have received the kindest invitations, and enjoyed the highest indulgences from him; that if any errors may have been committed in any parts of the administration, during the present disorders, every honest man ought to judge of them by this one rule, that is, the plain design for which all measures are calculated, which every body must admit to be the preservation of the Protestant succession: That all incidents Of such an administration ought to be covered or justified by the interest that shall appear to he carried on throughout the whole: That by the same rule of justice, when the destruction of the common interest was the plain intention of the late administration, the greatest weight ought to be laid oif every little circumstance that attended, in order to obtain a public satisfaction. That by taking in all these considerations, he thought the House would make a full and right judgment of the nature of this Rebellion; from whence it took its rise, how deep it had taken root, to what influences it was owing, and how far it extended; That the part the lord Derwentwater and otlters, had taken iu it, were to be considered as the first symptoms of that general disorder, for which so much foundation was laid; for which reason, he thought that the House could not consider this otherwise, than as the eause of the nation, in the strongest manner. That injustice to the king, as well as to the people, they ought to take this into their own hands, and not to entrust the prosecution it with any body hut themselves. That every body knew to what hazards prosecutions in the ordinary course of justice, were* liable, though they.were never so well concerted by those whose business it was to carry them on:but how sure soever this success might be, in a case so notorious as this, yet it was obvious to every body of what different weight and influence the prosecutions of parliament were, from those m the ordinary forms. That he owned he was surprised that any measures had been taken of that kind, against the Peers who had been taken in open rebellion, a parliament sitting, which had shewed so much zeal, and had contributed so much to the preservation of the government, especially at a time when the crown on the king’s head was fighting for. That he very weft knew, that though the House of Commons right of impeaching criminals was unlimited, yet they would exercise that' power by the rules of wisdom and discretion, and not engage in trivial matters, but in such only, where the offenders were not within the reach of the ordinary justice, or the nature of their crimes such as were not fit to be meddled with by the ordinary jurisdictions. That the case of the >ords taken in rebellion, was indeed aator:.o”st and

$33] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 11 l6.-*-lmpeachment of the Rebel Lords, [234

t>f which the proof would be easy; but though Hot from the difficulty of the prosecution, yet from the weight and consequence of it, he thought he need say little more to convince the House, to make it their own prosecution, by which they engaged every commoner in Great Britain, as an immediate party against those who had carried a war into the bowels of tfte kingdom. That no instance ever had risen in the English history, where their ancestors had permitted a prosecution of this bind, against the chief actors, to be carried any where hut in full Parliament. That the five Popish lords were pursued by the" loud voice and weight of the Commons of England; nnd though at that time the nation was in peace, they would not permit the fate of those prosecutions to depend on the care or skill of those who are versed in the ordinary forms of justice; and their success was answerable. That he owned his desire, upon all occasions to raise the honour and authority of parliaments, which he thought the greatest support of the honour and the prerogatives of the crown; for which reason, he took this occasion to speak more fully to the nature of impeachments, and the rather, because he apprehended some gentlemen had mistaken notions concerning them: that the power of impeachments was the most valuable and useful privilege that belonged to the body of the Commons, at least equal to that of giving money, which belongs solely to them. That gentlemen need not be apprehensive of any intricacies in those proceedings, especially at a time, and upon an occasion, when there was no doubt of the concurrence of both Houses. T^hat the Impeachments were in themselves more plain, regular, and disentangled, than any other forms of justice. That they were particularly excepted out of the late statute of treasons, which had very much fettered the ordinary course of proceedings. That impeachments were never made difficult, hut when they were carried on against the inclination of the crown, or at a time when there was no good understanding between the two Houses; when little occasions might be sought to raise disputes, and interrupt them; or else when they are undertaken, before they are well considered; -which could not be the present case. That there was another reason, which upon this occasion should determine gentlemen into this method; which was the consequence of the judgment that should be obtained against those Lords; he asserted it as his clear opiniob, and which he thought he ceuld maintain, That no pardon under the Great Seal could discharge a judgment obtained topon the Impeachment of the Commons: that this opinion had been strenuously asserted in this House in former reigns; and he thought it not weakened by the declaration in the Act *>f Settlement of the crown upon the House of llanover. That he had heard of a very new distinction that had been coined without doors, 'to avoid this opinion, viz. That the .pardon was not pleadable in bar of the impeachment,

* and to prevent the Commons from examining

* into the offence; but that it was pleadable

1 after judgment, and in bar of execution/

That whenever that question should come properly before them, he undertook to shew the idleness and absurdity of that distinction; that if that distinction was framed to make court to the prerogative, be thought it the most false and destructive piece of flattery of the kind, that ever had been raised. That it was the greatest ease, security, and support of the crown m his opinion, instead of any diminution of it, that no such power should -be lodged there, to be exercised on any occasion, to prevent the possibility of the crown’s being wrought upon by any influences to defeat the judgment given in full parliament, with the concurrence of both Houses, against the highest offenders; which must inevitably create the greatest jealousy, and cause the highest dissatisfactions between the crown and the people: for this reason, he took it to be the greatest advantage to the crown, that the constitution of the kingdom had not, as be thought, invested it with any such power; and on the other side it would clearly appear; that such a power was utterly inconsistent with the fundamental rights of parliament. That he owned he was surprised to hear, that any such distinction should.be started at this time: but if the law was as be apprehended it to be, it was the strongest reason for the Commons to interpose in this prosecution, to defend the crown from the mauy importunities to which it would be subject in the ordinary coarse of justice; and that the weight of the prosecution, and the consequences of it, should be borne by the Commons, as it ought to be in a case so national as this. That if gentlemen wanted any other motives to induce them to make this prosecution their own, he had a paper in his hand which would fire the thoughts of every gentleman there, [meaning the Pretender’s Declaration.*] That nobody could road, without

* The Pretender’s Declaration was in the following terms:

“ Whereas for many years last, a most wicked design and contrivance has been formed and carried on, to subvert thqancient and established government and the good laws of these kingdoms, to extirpate the true Protestant religion therein established, and to destroy its professors, and, instead thereof, to introduce and settle Popery and arbitrary power; in which unnatural and horrid conspiracy, great numbers of persons of different degrees and qualities have concerned themselves ‘and acted; and many Protestants pretending an uncommon zeal for the church of England, have joined themselves with professed Papists, uniting their endeavours to accomplish and execute the aforesaid wicked and traiterous designs.

“ And whereas it pleased Almighty God, in his good Proridence, and in his great mercy and goodness to these nations, to crown the unwearied endeavours of his late majesty king William theSd, of ever gloriousmeitory, by making him the instrument to procure the Settlement of the Crown of these realms in the illustrious house of Hanover, as the only means, under God, to preserve our religion, laws, and liberties, and to secure the Protestant interest of Europe, since which happy establishment, the said conspirators have been indefatigable in their endeavours to destroy the same, and to make way for the vain and groundless hopes of a spurious impostor and Popish Pretender to the imperial crown of these realms; and, to accomplish these ends, the most immoral, irreligious, and unchristian-like methods, have been taken; but more particularly in the last years of the reign of the late queen Anne, during which time all imaginable endeavours were used by the said conspirators to prejudice the '

. minds of the subjects of this realm against the legality and justice of the said settlement of the crown:and, for that purpose, the holy Scriptures were wrested, and the most wholesome doctrines of the church of England perverted and abused, by men in holy orders, in the most v public and scandalous manner, in order to condemn the justice of the late happy Revolution, and thereby to sap and undermine the foundation.of the said happy establishment; and the most notorious instruments of these wicked purposes were countenanced by particular marks of public favour and distinction; false and dangerous notions of a sole hereditary right So the imperial crown of these realms were propagated and encouraged by persons in the

highest trusts and employments, contrary to the ancient undoubted and established laws of these kingdoms; Jesuitical and scandalous distinctions were invented, and publicly inculcated, to enervate the farce and obligation of those oaths, which had been contrived in the plainest -and strongest terms, by the wisdom of parliament, for the security of the said establishment, and, to conceal their designs, thereby thq better to enable them to carry on the same, great numbers of the said conspirators, of all ranks and conditions, pretending a zeal for the Protestant succession, openly and voluntarily took the said oaths; groundless fears of the danger of the church of England were fomented throughout these kingdoms, to disorder the minds of well disposed Protestants. By all which and many other such ungodly practices' of the said conspirators, the most causeless and dangerous jealousies and dissatisfactions were created in the minds of the good people of this kingdom, and great numbers of well meaning but deluded Protestants were mftch disquieted; but nevertheless, these dishonest methdds were pursued by the said conspirators with indefatigable industry, as the only means to weaken the foundations of the said happy establishment.

“ And whereas the dissolution of the late glorious confederacy against France, and the loss of the balance of power iri Europe, were further steps necessary to complete the designs of the said conspirators, and the same being effected by the late ignominious peace with France, the French king was rendered formidable, and the Protestant succession was thereby brought into the most imminent danger; and, by these and other pernicious measures, the destruction so long intended by the said conspirators for these poor nations seemed near at hand; at which time, and under which roost deplorable circumstances, it pleased Almighty God in his infinite wisdom to call to himself the late queen Anne, and, by a concurrence of many most wonderful providences, to give a quiet and peaceable accession to his present most gracious majesty to the throne of his ancestors, to which be was received with one full vqice and consent of tongue and heart, and the united joy of every good subject and good Protestant, as their only lawful and rightful liege lord; and although, from the moment his majesty ascended the throne to this day, his reign has been one series of wisdom, justice, and clemency, his labours constant, unwearied, and successful, to retrivethe honour and reputation of these nations, to re-establish the trade and recover the wealth of his kingdoms; and although all imaginable encouragement has been given to the church of England, and all tender-, ness shewn even to his Popish subjects, ant) his constant care has been to procure the universal good of his people; nevertheless the said conspirators have, by the most vile and impious, methods, renewed their endeavours to throw these kingdoms iuto the utmost confusion, and to entail endless miseries on us and our pot-

ferities; ' lor these ends, many of the above-mentioned most wicked and dangerous practices have been repeated, with the utmost industry and inveteracy, to delude, disorder, ami corrupt, the minds of his majesty's good subjects; the most groundless jealousies have beep fomented against his wise and happy administration; and, in many parts of his kingdoms, the most unnatural unexampled riots and tumults, by the secret and malicious endeavours of the said conspirators, have been procured, stirred, tip; and encouraged against his peaceable Protestant subjects, under false pretences of Seal for the church of England, and thereby tnore effectually to delude his good subjects, and seduce them' from their allegiance, and are them for an open rebellion.

And the said conspirators, having at length resolved to deprive these nations of (he invaluable blessings which they now enjoy under the wise and gentle reign of his present most gracious majesty king George, and of the certain prospect of happiness which they have for iheir posterity in a succession of princes derived from himself, did contrive, confederate, andresolve, to put their most malicious, wicked and traiterous designs, ipto immediate execution; for which purpose, James earl of Derwent-water, William, lord Widdrington, William earl of Nithisdale, George, earl of Winton, Robert earl of Carnwath, William viscount Kenmure and William lord Nairn, together with Thomas Forster jun. lord Charles Murray, Edward Howard, Thomas Errington, John Claverine, William Shaftoe, sir Francis Anderton, Ralph Standish, Richard Townley, Thomas Butler, Thomas Walton, Gabriel Hesket, Richard Gascoigne, and divers other persons, as fetse traitors to his present most sacred majesty king George, the only lawful and undoubted sovereign of these kingdoms, having withdrawn their allegiance and cordial love, and true and due obedience, which they as good and faithful subjects owed to his said majesty, did io or about the months of September, October, or November, 1T15, most wickedly, maliciously, fUsely and traitorously, imagine and compass •be death of his said most sacred majesty.

“And, for the accomplishing and executing their said traiterous purpose, they the said James earl of Derwentwater, William lord Widdnagton, William earl of Nkhisdale, George earl of Winton, Robert earl of Carnwath, William viscount Kenmure, and William lord Naira, did, in abput the said months or some of them, and at divers orhertiraes, and divers: places within this kingdom, Wickedly and traitorously agree, confederate, conspire, and resolve, together with many other evil disposed persons, so raise, excite, and levy within the counties of Teviotdkrie, Northumberland, Cumberland^ and the' county palatine of Lancaster, and elsewhere within this kingdom, a most cruel, bloody, and destructive war against his majesty, in order to depose and .murder his acted majesty, and to deprive him of hfcfoyfd State, crown, and dignity,

Then the said Articles of Impeachment were read unto them:after which, the Lord Chancellor asked them severally, “ What they had to say thereunto ? and, if they had any thing to request of the House, this was their proper time.”

Thereupon the earl of Derwentwater acquainted the House, “ He was unprepared, and very ignorant of the forms of their lordships judicature: and desired be might have a copy of the said Articles, and such time to answer as the House shpuld think fit; and that counsel might be assigned to assist him.” And the other lords severally making the same requests: they were directed to withdraw. And being accordingly withdrawn; the House took their requests into consideration. And the entry in the Journal of the 9th of April 1679, in the case of the Five Popish Lords impeached being read; the House ordered, That the several Lords now impeached should be allowed copies of the said Articles of Impeachment, and time till Saturday next to put in their Answers thereunto; and that counsel should be assigned them, in order to assist them in preparing their Answers, and likewise in their defence in matters of law.

The Common? Address to the King respecting the Rebellion.] January 10. The Com-

mons agreed upon the following Address to his Majesty: ,

“ Most Gracious Sovereign;

“We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great Britain inparliament assembled return your majesty our unfeigned thanks for your most gracious Speech from the throne.

“ We beg leave most heartily to congratulate your majesty upon the success that has attended your arms; and it is with the greatest satisfaction we observe, that the officers and soldiers of the army have, by a brave and faithful discharge of their duty, deserved your majesty’s approbation; and that the just and necessary measures, . taken for strengthening your majesty’s hands, have had so good an effect in preventing insurreotions in several parts of the kingdom.

“ The wise and seasonable provision, which jour majesty has made, both at home, and from abroad, for the safety of the nation: your goodness in giving all such estates as shall be forfeited by this'rebellion in ease of your people; and the tender regard and concern which you have been pleased to express for their sufferings; call for all the returns of duty, zeal, and affection, which faithful and loyal subjects can owe, or pay, to the best of kings.

“ This Rebellion, for which not the least colour of provocation has been given, as it ought very justly to be the objept of your majesty’s contempt; so it raises in yOur truly loyal Commons the highest resentment ana indignation againsl.thase ungrateful, desperate rebels, whose pernicious principles, private discontents and disappointments, have engaged them to involve their country in blood and confusion.

“ We look with pity upon those unhappy deluded people, who, by false pretences, and malicious insinuations, have been betrayed ipto their own destruction: but we detest, and will do our, utmost to confound, the devices of those, who professing an unlimited obedience, have stirred up a rebellion against your majesty; and under the disguise of the danger of the church are. endeavouring to introduce popery: and when we reflect, that nothing less than our holy religion, your majesty’s crown, and the liberties of our country, are concerned in the event of this wicked undertaking, we cannot but with astonishment observe the indifference of some in this great and important juncture.

“ But your faithful Commons, with hearts full of a due sense of the invahiluable blessings which they enjoy under your majesty’s most auspicious government, offer their lives and fortunes in defence of your undoubted title to the crown, in support of the protestant religion, and in 'maintenance of the liberty and property of the subject; which, as they were wonderfully preserved to us by your majesty’s happy accession to the throne, can only be secured to posterity by the eye of Heaven watching over, and guarding, your sacred person, and your royal family.

“ And, that this nation may long continue to be a protestant and free people, your most dutiful and loyal Commons do most readily promise to grapt such early and effectual supplies, as may enable your majesty to put an end to thid unnatural rebellion; to confouud and extinguish for ever all hopes of the Pretender, his open and secret abettors; and secure the future pfeace and tranquillity of your kingdoms) being well assured, that your good people will think no burden grievous, that is necessary for the preservation of all that is dear and valuable to them.

* But .your majesty’s care and concern for the public welfare has not been confined to your own kingdoms; and however your enemies might hatter themselves, that

these intestine commotions would lessen the influence of. Great Britain in foreign parts, your Commons with admiration see, and with gratitude, acknowledge, the effect of your wisdom, which has been able to surmount these difficulties, in settling the barrier treaty, for the Netherlands between the emperor and the States General under your majesty’s guaranty; in having made so great a progress towards renewing all former alliances between Great Britain and the States General; and particularly in delivering that valuable branch of our commerce with Spain from those grievous impositions and hardships, to which it was subjected by the treachery of the late mal-administration.

* And as the same fatal and pernicious counsels have been the cause and source of all the mischiefs and calamities that must' attend this unnatural rebellion; and as your faithful Commons, desirous to testify their zeal and duty to your majesty, and their abhorrence of this treasonable enterprize, have already exerted themselves in endeavouring to bring to speedy and exemplary justice the open and declared instruments of this rebellion; they think themselves obliged, in justice to their injured country, to continue in the most vigorous and impartial manner, to prosecute the authors of those evil and destructive counsels, which have drawn down these miseries on the nation.”

The King's Answer.} To the said Address his Majesty returned this Answer:

“ Gentlemen;

u I return you my hearty thanks for the kind and warm assurances of loyalty contained in this Address, y from which I promise myself the most happy consequences; since nothing can so effectually restore the peace and tranquillity of the kingdom, as the commendable zeal you have expressed upon this occasion.”

The Earl of Strafford’s Answer to ths Articles of Impeachment against him.] January 17. The Lords sent a Message to the Commons to acquaint them, that the Earl of Strafford had put in his Answer to the Articles of Impeachment exhibited against him, (see p. 144.) and commanded their Messengers to leave a copy thereof with them. The said Answer is as fullows:

The ANSWER of THOM AS Earl of STRAFFORD, to the Articles exhibited by the . Knights, Citizens, ' and Burgesses, in Par* liament assembled, in the name of themselves and of all the Commons of Great Britain, in Maintenance of the Impeachment against him for High Crimes and Misdemeanors supposed to have been

. by him committed.

uThe said Earl, saving to himself all advantages of exception to the said Articles, for the

247} PAUL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 1715. — TteEdrl Str*£orA'* Antwtr [94 *

Uncertainty find insufficiency thereof, and of not being prejudiced by any words or want of form in this his Answer; and also saving to himself all rights and privileges belonging to him as one of the peers of this realm; in answer to the said Articles, admits that divers treaties and alliances were entered into, by the crown of Great Britain, with the‘several potentates mentioned in the preamble to the said Articles; but, for more (certainty as to the contents thereof, the said earl refers to the said treaties themselves; and, with the utmost deference to the memory of his late royal master king William the Third, doth acknowledge the great wisdom of that glorious prince, who, by the grand alliance, formed a noble design of settling a due balance of power in Europe; but humbly begs leave to observe, that the affront offered by France, in acknowledging the Pretender king of Great Britain, though justly mentioned by her late majesty queen Anne, of ever blessed memory, as one cause of the war which, in May 1702, was by her declared against France and Spain, could not be any inducement to the forming the grand affiance, as is suggested in the preamble to the said Articles, being subsequent to it, as most evidently appears; inasmuch as that alliance wa9 not only formed, bat concluded and signed, at the Hague, during the life time of the late king James the Seeond, and the said earl admits, that^ the emperor and the States Gene-sal did also about May 1702; declare war against France and Spain: and that other kiugs, princes, and states of Europe, soon after became parties to the said confederate war; which having been carried on for many Tears at a vast expence of blood and treasure, her said late majesty, out of her tender regard for the good of her people, and from a sincere and real design to prevent the further effusion of blood, and to 'ease her subjects from the heavy burden of taxes which they had so long endured, did hearken to overtures of peace from France, after former negotiations had been rendered fruitless-; and give instructions to the then ford privy seal, now bishop of London, and' him the said earl, to treat thereof at Utrecht, in conjunction with the ministers of her allies, in order to bring the same to an happy conclusion; and among such instructions several clauses were interspersed, to the effect in the said preamble set forth; but, for rnore qertainty, refers to his original untrue-tions; which, together with all his other papers relating to his negotiations in the Low Countries, were taken from him in the begin-aing of January last, and ho supposes may continue in the hands of one of his majesty's principal secretaries of state: Bnt the g&id earl is totally ignorant of any treacherous correspondence with the emissaries1 of France, or of any private or destructive negotiation of peace, set on foot with intent to weaken or dissolve the confederacy between her said late majesty and her allies.

u And for particular answer to the several

matters wherewith he stands charged in the First Article; the said earl sakb, That having been employed by his late majesty- king William in the arjny during his whole reign, and likewise in his court for several years next before his death; and having also had the honour to be sent as hiS majesty's minister to the king of Prussia; he was so happy as to reconcile some differences which had lately arisen between those two princes, and upon his return received his royal master's approbation. Her late majesty queen Anne, soon after her accession to the throne, was pleased to command him to leave his post in the army, and to gw. ' again to the said court of Prussia, in the year 1702, where he had the character of her ambassador extraordinary, and continued in that quality till April 1711, at which time her majesty thought fit to appoint him her ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the States General; and in June following her majesty was pleased to honour him- with (he title of one of her privy council; and about December in the same year to appoint him one of her plenipotentiaries to treat at Utrecht, with the ministers of France, of a general peace. And the said earl thought it hisduty not to scruple any danger or pains for her service, believing his seal therein was the best evidence be could give of his hearty affection to hie country; and ho constantly did, with the utmost sincerity, endeavour, according to his abilities, to pursue the true ends of his commission and powers, to promote the honour and; safety of her majesty and her kingdoms, to answer the engagements she was under to Iter:allies, and to secure the common liberties o€ Europe:But he must with the utmost detes-: tation and abhorrence, deny font he was in; the least devoted to the interest or. service of the Frtench king:or that he ever acted in defiance of any of the said treaties, or of the ad* vice of parliament, or of apy declarations of her majesty from the throne, or of her assurances to the States General to act in concert with them, in making peace as in making war, or of her instructions to him under her sign manual. The said earl admits, thaft, as W was a privy Counsellor, it was his duty truly to have advised her majesty in all matters treated of in council fvtyJst he was preseBt; and; had any thing so treated of appeared to him jo have been to the dishonour of her majesty, or to the-prejudice of her people, the said earl would not have been wonting to advise against, and with all humility to oppose the same; but, ashe was her majesty’s ambassador and plenipotentiary, he looked upon himself as a ministerial officer, whose duty it was to pursue such-instructions as he should from time to time re^ ceive; and since he could not- doubt but that all orders sent him by her majesty’s directions had been first maturely weighed and .digested, he humbly apprehends your lordships will thihk. it; had been too great a presumption in him to advise against of oppose such orders, which curried *Ot id'jjjbemselvcs any apparent idega-

iky, when he knew not the springs or reasons of them; and which therefore it became him to believe well warranted, and to 'have proceeded from jest and proper grounds and motives. And the said earl writh, be was so far from advising or exhorting that any private, separate, dishonourable, or destructive negotiation of peace, should be continued and carried on between the ministers of Great Britain and Franck, without communication thereof to her majesty's allies according to their treaties, or from being instrumental in promoting any such negotiation as in the said Article is charged, that he did not know, or believe, that any such negotiation was entered into. And, for a plain relation of the said earl's proceeding in this affair, he saith, that, about May 1711, being then her majesty's ambassador and plenipotentiary to the States General, he received, from one of her principal secretaries of state, a paper, supposed to be signed by M. de Torcy, containing some proposals for setting on foot a negotiation of peace, with orders to commenicate the same to the Pensionary of Holland, that his sentiments might be known thereupon: and to assure that minister, and others of that re public, That the queen mp

* resolved, in making peace as id making war, to

* act iu concert with the States In pursuance of which orders, he the said earl did immediately communicate the said proposals to the Pensionary, and unto two others of the States General, who had formerly been employed in the negotiations at Geitruydenfeerg, and whom the Pensionary thought the most proper tu be entrusted with that matter:And they, having considered the said proposals, did pray the said earl to return her majesty thanks, m the name <of the States, for her confidence in them; deplored themselves weary of the war, and ready to join in any measures her majesty should think proper for obtaining a good peace, and that they hoped her majesty would bring the French to explain more particularly the Several points contained- in the abovementioned proposals. Of this-, the said earl sent an account to her majesty's secretary of state, and soon after received her commands to repair to England; and on his arrival here acquainted her majesty with, his proceedings at the Hague: But being, by her gracious permission, allowed to follow some private affairs of his own, he was often in the country, and so much engaged fhat he did not know of arty of the trahsaetious with M. Mesnoger, , or what was done in relation to the explications the States had desired her majesty to procure from France, upon the points of M. Torcy’s proposal; tiH in October following, he received instructions, dated the first of that month, whereby he was required to return tO'Hottand, and to communicate to the States some propositions, which had been signed by the said M. Mesnagerthe 27th day of September before, as, a foundation for opening the conferences of peace with France: which he supposes to be the instructions intended by those mentioned in rite preamble to the Articles

as dated the 21st day of October, none of that date appearing amongst the copies of his own papers he has been permitted to take:But the smd earl never saw M. Mesnager, till he met him at Utrecht in January 1711-12; nor daring all the time of the said ministers stay in England. was in the least privy to, or made acquainted with, any transaction between him and any of the queen’s minister's. The said earl having received his said instructions, took his journey for Holland; ahd, on his arrival there in pursuance thereof, imparted to the States General the said propositions, and what had been communicated to him concerning any transactions between Great Britain and France, and at the same time, in further pursuance of his sard instructions, declared to-thein, That if they did not think those propo* ‘ sitions a sufficient ground to open the confe-‘ fences, bat were desirous to carry on the Wa ‘ her majesty was willing to concur with them; 1 but could no longer bear that disproportions^ *ble burthen which had been yearly increased

* On her subjects, nor that deficiency her allies *

* had been guilty of in every part of the war; ‘ and that therefore it was incumbent on them, ‘ if the war continued, to furnish such quo cay ‘ of skips and forces for the future, as they had ‘ to that time been wanting in? That this was *

* what her majesty thought she might justly in *

* s*st on: That they should comply with her, is

, ters, and inform himself of the circumstances

* of affairs, and make report thereof to his masters; who having continued here some time^ and transmitted to Holland an account of the

; posture of affairs, the States General consented to open the conferences for peace, and to invite the other allies to &nd their ministers to; Utrecht, the place agreed on fin* that purpose; t and, in order thereunto, granted 'passports for - the French ministers to repair thither: And the said earl is informed, that amongst other transactions by the said M. Boys whilst id England, he signed a treaty with far late majesty's ministers who were empowered for that purpose, dated, the 18th day of December

1711, 0.8. for the carrying on the war and the negotiations of peace, according to the mutual engagements of former treaties between England and Holland: which treaty was ratified by her said late majesty the day after tt was signed, and was sent to Holland by the then lord privy seal; fart the States General, though their ministers were often called upon, neves ratified the same. And the said earl admits, ihat the said lord privy seal and himself were appointed to be far majesty's plenipotentiaries

251] PAUL. HISTORY, 2 GbokckI. 1716. —

at the said Congress at Utrecht; and he can with great truth affirm, that he acted, on alt occasions, with the highest and most disinterested zeal, for procuring a general peace, for the mutual advantage of her majesty's subjects . aod allies, in pursuance of the powers and instructions received for that purpose; and is firmly persuaded his colleague did the same. { The said earl saith, that every one of the confederates had their ministers at Utrecht who all agreed in the method and manner of proceeding in the said negotiation; and had frequent meetings and conferences to that end among themselves, in order to lay down a genera) scheme for their conduct; and, for the better concerting these measures, it was thought fit to have two conferences a week with all the allies; two with the Dutch apart, . and two of all the allies with the French; and in those with the Dutch and the other allies, what was to be proposed, on the part of the allies, to the French, was always previously settled. In the first general conference with the French ministers, they offered either to proceed to the explanation of the general points signed by M. Mesnager (which they acknowledged were binding only to France, and not to the allies ), or that each of the allies should make their demands. On deliberation, it was insisted by the allies, That the French should first give in a specific plan of the offers of the king their master to all and each of the allies; and the French complied to give in such specific plan, in case the allies would promise to return an answer thereunto containing their several demands: and accordingly the French ministers did give in such

f»lan, in writing; and the allies, in answer, de-ivered in their demands also, in writing. The French having thus given in theirconcessions in writing, and received the demands of the allies in like manner, thought fit to propose the entering into debate upon the several propositions mutually delivered in agreeably to the course of proceeding in former treaties: But though some of the allies thought there was no necessity of insisting very much on any further written answer, yet others pressed it more vehemently; to which the French replied, That, both sides having already explained themselves in writ- jug, it was agreeable to the method of all ne- gotiations, to proceed to debate matters; and,

* in such debates, specific answers to each de- maud of the allies would occur.' And all the fillies agreed in this principle, < That the me-<.thod most expeditious and safe, whether by writing or otherwise, was fittest to be fol- lowed. '

^ Thus having given your lordships a short narrative of the proceedings which might render his Answer to the several particulars charged in this Article more intelligible: As to that part which mentions- his frequently concerting private and separate measures with the ministers of France; the said earl doth acknowledge, (hat, when the settling any particular interest of Qreat Britain might require it, he and his col-

The Earl of Straffor Ansvscr [£53

league might confer with the ministers of France, in the same manner as the ministers of each, of the allies conferred separately with those of France, touchingrtheir respective^articular interests: And the said earl apprehends they were justified therein, by their express orders from England for that purpose. And sometimes the said bishop and earl had separate conferences with the ministers of France at the request, and on the behalf, of one or other of. the allies, whose regard to her majesty made them often desire the interposition of her ministers, to support their several pretensions; wherein the zeal and sincere endeavours of the said bishop and earl for the interest of the allies always appeared, to the satisfaction of those on whose behalf they acted:But he denies that be did concert any private or separate measures with the ministers of France, in order to impose upon .or deceive her majesty's subjects or allies, or tending to their prejudice or detriment. And as to that part which changes him with commending the prudence of the French ministers, in refusing to answer in writing; the said earl saith, that after the written propositions and demands on each side had been delivered in, he took it to* be a matter in: its own nature indifferent, whether there should-be any further transaction thereupon in writing, or not; and whether it were better to proceed by way of writing, or by conference, to adjust and settle the terms of peace, upon the respective offers and demauds which had been so given in. There was variety of opinions :' Many of the ministers of th, e allies declared it to be the .most usual and expeditious method to proceed by way of conference, which they thought gave better opportunities of considering and explaining matters; there being usually seen a greater stiffness and obstinacy in maintaining what is once put down in writing, which oftentimes renders negotiation tedious, and sometimes clogs them with iusuperable difficulties; and there seemed to be just grounds for suspicion, that some, who were most pressing for the method of writing, might have those ends in their view, which it became her majesty's plenipotentiaries, as far as they could, to. obviate and prevent. If therefore, the said, earl inclined in his private opinion, to the sentiments of those who thought the way of conference more expeditious and equally safe (admitting he had been mistaken therein ), he hopes it will not be imputed to him us a crime: Much less can he apprehend your lordships will esteem it any evidence of his- encouraging the enemy in any fallacious or unjustifiable manner of proceedings, if, in a letter from (he Hague to a minister of the queen, before this matter had been fully considered, he intimated the thoughts he then entertained of it; since hq takes it to be very proper for a public, minister abroad* in his correspondence with the more immediate servants of the crown at home, to give minute and particular accounts of all occurrences and discourses, to lay open his thoughts, to suggest the first motions and su *

353] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 171(5. — to the Articles of Impeachment. [254

picions that arise in his mind, and to descant upon things without reserve, in order to re-‘ ceive more plain, full, and express informations and directions for his better proceeding: And the said earl believes it will appear, that, if, in any letter he intimated his thoughts upon that subject, he did not give any positive judgment, but suspended his opinion therein till he should have opportunity of further considering it: And he saith, that, when afterwards the matter came to be more maturely debated among the ministers of the allies, upon his return to Utrecht, he did join in pressing the ministers of "France to give a further answer in writing. And as to that part which ebargeth the said earl with suggesting methods for France to make use of, to create dissentions among the allies, and procure' separate negotiations be* tween each of the allies and France; he saitb, that it was generally thought most proper, that the respective demands of the allies, which were sometimes clashing and contradictory to each other, should be considered apart, and pot at general Conferences with the French; which seemed the more requisite, since no prince or state had undertaken the part of a mediator to reconcile the differences which might happen to arise among them, as has heen usual in former treaties. If, therefore, in a lettet to a minister of the queen, from the consideration of the possibility that some might he for the contrary method, he intimated that the inconvenience of such a method would best appear by beginning in the congress, to ai^ue on some demand of one of the, allies, which would probably induce such ally to propose the debating separately; he hopes this can never be construed the suggesting a method for (France to make use of, to create dissentions ‘ among the allies/ or which could have any tendency to dissolve the confederacy; it seeming rather, to him; a likely means to prevent any such unhappy consequence:Sure he is, that he sincerely laboured to prevent it; and, for that end, employed his utmost endeavours to obviate and discourage any. fallacious or unjustifiable manner of transacting the negotiation •of peace* And he denies that he did at any time suggest any method whatsoever, for France to make use of, to create dissentions among the allies or separate negotiations between any of the allies and France, thereby to dissolve the confederacy; and as he constantly opposed what he apprehended or suspected to have any such tendency, so he never failed to support, in 1 the best manner he could, her majesty's allies in their demands against France; and denies that, in the course of the negotiation, he was guilty of any treacherous proceeding, or of any practices whatsoever, whereby he could prostitute the honour of the queen or the imperial crown of these realms: or whereby he did violate his powers or instructions, the treaties her majesty stood engaged in to her allies, or any assurances he had given them by her order, or in her name; or whereby the design of the confederacy, or the support expected from it,

were rendered useless; or the affairs of Europe given up into the hands of France.

“ In answer to the Second Article; the said earl saitb, he always thought an union and good correspondence between her late majesty and the illustrious house of Hanover of the utmost importance, and therefore used his best endeavours to continue and improve it; and never had the least design to create or widen any differences or misunderstandings between them. He acknowledges, that the Parliament, with great wisdom, provided laws for preserving the Protestant religion, establishing the Protestant succession, and laying the obligation of an oath on the subjects of these realms to maintain the same; and the said earl humbly hopes, that he, in his station, hath never been wanting in his faithful endeavours for the security thereof: and, to his great honour, he hath frequently receivedfrom her late electoral highness the princess Sophia, and from his present majesty, their approbation of his zeal for their service: and he does with reat pleasure and satisfaction reflect on the appy success of his endeavours in the late-treaty of peace at Utrecht, by which Franco and Spain were brought to acknowledge our present sovereign's right of succession to the imperial crown of these realms, and to engage never to oppose or disturb the same directly or indirectly; whereby his majesty had a peaceable accession to the throne, and the benefit of the several laws made in support of the said succession will more securely be transmitted to posterity. The said earl denies that he, by false representations, or by any reflections upon his majesty, when elector of Hanover, in any letter to the late queen's ministers or otherwise, did endeavour to alienate her majesty's affections from his electoral highness: and saith, that to such a general charge it is impossible to make any particular answer or defence; but the said earl is firmly persuaded, there is not any expression, in any letter by him wrote, that car* ries the appearance of any such false representation or reflection; such expressions being as remote from his heart and intentions, as they are inconsistent with that respect to the illustrious house of Hanover, which, by the whole tenor of his actions, he hath endeavoured to de- monstrate. And therefore the said eayl hath that assurance of your lordship's justice, as to believe that no doubtful words or passages contained in any of his letters, no accounts or censures (if any such there be^of what was said or done by any minister or servant of his electoral highness, inconsistent, as he apprehended, with that deference which ought to have been paid to her late majesty, will be taken by your lordships as an evidence of any design to alienate her late majesty's affections from his, then electoral highness, or to create or widen any differences or misunderstandings between them, with which the said earl is charged in the said Article. And as to the particular reflection supposed to have been made by the said earl, in his letter of the 17th day of July

255] PAUL. HISTORY, f George 1. 1716. — Earl of Stratford's Answer [255

171*4, on his then electoral highness; the Mid earl humbly hopes that your lordships wiU not interpret any expression in that letter to have been meant of his electoral highness, who is not so much as once named throughout the same, and whom the said earl hath never mentioned, in any letter whatsoever, without the highest respect and veneration; hut that your lordships ' will rather understand k, as it was meant, with respect to the general of the Hanover troops, whose conduct, the said earl owns, be hath expressed himself, as well in that as in some preceding dispatches, not to have been intirely satisfied with: how far he was right in his opinion, he submits to your lordships wise determination; but humbly hopes, that no representation thereof by him made, however he may be thought to have been mistaken therein, proceeding only from a sincere seal for the honour of his royal mistress and the interest of his country, can be judged criminal. And the said earl saith, that the Tate queen was so far from being prevailed on, by his advice, to make a* cessation of arms with France, without concert with his electoral highness, or against the con-eent or representations of any of the allies, that he can an, d doth with truth affirm, that her majesty’s resolutions, concerning the said cessation, were aot taken upon his advice, or with his privity. The said earl ‘doth admit, that, about June or July 1712, be was sent to the army, by her majesty’s command, with particular instructions touching the said cessation; and that, in pursuance of his said instructions, he discoursed several of the generals of the allies, partinplarly Monsieur Buleau; and that be ought, in such discourse, on the 16th day of July 1712, affirm, as he then thought, 4 that her majesty had made no truce wkh Franceand the said earl was then of that opinion; the articles demanded by her majesty for a cessation of arms, as tha conditions without which no cessation was to be made, not having at that time, to hi» knowledge er belief, been pevforno-td by France. And the saideapl can assuredly .•ay, that he doth not remember he hath, at any |ime, knowingly, affirmed to the ministers of his •aid electoral highness, up any other of the allies, any untruths, or any thing contrary to the intentions or interest of the late queen, thereby l» deceive or impose upon his electoral highness, or any of her majesty’s allies: and apprehends that he hath aot, in any of his negotiations or proceedings, prostituted or dishonoured the character he was invested with; or done any thing tending to dissolve the mutual confidence and good understanding between her late majesty and the illustrious house of Hanover.

« In answer to the Third Article; the said earl denies any perniciousoegotiations of peace to have been carried on by ban with the ministers of France; and saith, that, in the paper mqntmaed in- his instructions to- be signed by

M. Messages, and delivered to him, together with his said instructions, on or about tpe 1st d«y of October 1711, it is said, < the French

Jt is weH known, the title of his late majesty king William was not acknowledged at Ryswick, tiU that peace was signed; nor was the emperor’s or the king of Prussia^ owned, duriugthe late negotiations, till the concluding their respective treaties of peace. When, therefore, the said earl had an instructions to iusist upon a more formal acknowledgement; he hopes he cannot be charge ed with any want of duty to her majesty, or want of zeal for the Protestant succession, in not advising her majesty against treating with France, upon the terms on which she entered into the negotiation at Utrecht.

king had proposed to acknowledge her majesty’s title to these realms no sooner than when the peace should be signed, did, by their address of the 15th day of February 1711, with a commendable zeal, represent to her late majesty their just indignation at< such dishonourable treatment, and express their resentment at such terms of peace offered to her majesty and her allies by the plenipotentiaries of France; and it was agreeable to the duty and affection that august assembly always demonstrated towards that excellent princess, to be touched with the lefast appearance or apprehension of disrespect to her sacred person:and her majesty, being sensible that their address proceeded from those motives, was pleased to return them her hearty «thanks, for the zeal they expressed for her honour. And the said earl admits, that, in a letter from the secretary of state to the then lord privy seal and himself, mention was made of the said address; and thereupon they gave an account of the steps by them taken on this subject, to the following effect: that, the day after the receipt of that letter, the French plenipotentiaries were told, that, the deferring to make a formal agnition of the queen at first having had all the effect intended, it would be proper then to do it more formally, for reasons.

* with which it was needless to acquaint them; 4 otherwise it would be necessary to insert it in the British demandsthat they made no other difficulty in it but this, that, having re-‘ ported to their court how that matter had passed, they ought, in decency, to give an account of what was then desired ; ’and said,

4 they doubted not in ten or twelve days to give intire satisfaction therein :* but, being pressed to do something immediately, they agreed,

* that, if her majesty’s plenipotentiaries would write to them, they would give an answer, 4 whereby the queen should be directly acknow- leiiged:’ which was accordingly done; and the said earl believes, that a copy-thereof might be transmitted to England, but not the original: and denies that, to his knowledge, it was a col-, htsive letter; or that there was any agreement between the Britishmnd French ministers, not to make use of it at Utrecht, or not to have it taken as an acknowledgement by France of the queen’s title to the crown; or that the copy of it was transmitted with design to deceive or impose upon the queen or* parliament; nor doth be know, vOr believe, it was made use of for any auch purpose; but he takes it to have been an nctual acknowledgment of the queen’s title by France, and a further evidence that such a^ni-tion was not deferred till, the signing of the peace, though it was intended to be then made in a more solemn manner. And the said earl believes the honourable House of Peers, for whose judgment he ever bad the highest veneration and regard, were satisfied in this point; ..since, by their address of the 10th of June following, after they had been acquainted, by her majesty’s speech from the throne, with the terras on which a general peace might bo bad, they thought fit to thank her majesty for her

VOL.V1I.

condescension therein, and did express their reliance on her wisdom to finish that great and good work; as the House of Commons also did, by their address to her majesty, about the same time. ' And the said earl is well assured, he was not wanting in his zeal and regard for the security of the Protestant succession; on which head the British plenipotentiaries, at the very first general conference with the French ministers at Utrecht, pressed their explanation; and they agreed thereunto: and, when the allies delivered their respective demands, the queen’s ministers, on their part, insisted in such manner on what related to the security of that succession, that the princess Sophia was pleased to honour them with a fetter of thanks, and to acknowledge their care of the interest of her family: nor were they less careful, at the conclusion of the treaty, to settle that important point with the utmost exactness, to the satisfaction of the c|ueeri, the court of Hanover, and both houses of parliament; and the articles for that purpose were not only conceived in stronger terms than had been made use of at Ryswick, for acknowledging the then settlement of the crown; but, before they were inserted in the treaty, were communicated to the minister of the elector, and had his approbation; and the manner of that transaction seems sufficiently justified, from the happy effects. The said earl absolutely denies, that he did ever concert or agree with the ministers of France, that any proposals mentioned in the said Article, or any other proposals whatsoever, should be the conditions whereon France should treat of peace with Great Britain:nor doth he know that the queen, the parliament, or the nation, were in any respect abused, or drawn into destructive measures: or that any step was taken, on this occasion, whereby dishonour could accrue to her majesty or these kingdoms, or any danger to the Protestant succession.

uIn answer to the Fourth Article; the said earl saith, That the bishop of Bristol and himself, being appointed her majesty’s plenipotentiaries, did, soon after their arrival at Utrecht, pursuant to their instructions, begin by concerting with the ministers of the allies, in what manner it was most proper to open the conferences, and what method was to be observed in the progress of the treaty; and if it had been thought proper to begin with the disposition of the Spanish monarchy, the said earl was ready to have insisted as the said instructions directed him to do in that case; but, upon such concert, it was thought most adviseable, and so agreed by all the ministers of the allies, that each of them should, by a separate instrument make their respective demands, with a general clause to support each other’s just and reasonable pretensions; and this was looked upon a» the most proper method, and necessary to avoid that confusion which would otherwise ensue from the contrariety of the demands of the several allies; it being then known that many of them did and would insist to have tht S

same thing for themselves, in opposition to each other. The Imperial ministers, as well as the rest, acquiesced in that method; and at a follgwing conference, it was further desired, that there should be added to such general clause the words in ‘ conformity to their alliances/ with which the said bishop and earl, as well as the rest, most readily complied: and these words were accordingly added to the general clause in each of the allies demands, which seemed to give a general satisfaction; and there Was nothing further at that time, insisted on. In consequence of this agreement, it was the general expectation, that the demand relating to Spain and the West, Indies should be particularly inserted only in the instrument to be given in by the Imperial ministers: but there having been a day long before fixed for delivering in to the French all the demands of the allies; the Imperialists, the verv night preceding at a conference, proposed, ‘ Tnat all the allies 1 should mention Spain and the West Indies ‘ likewise in their several demands/ This caused a general surprise, and none but the ' ministers of Portugal concurred with them; those of the States m particular declared, < The € said dominions ought to be demanded by them

* whom it did immediately concern; and that < the method things had been put into, could ‘ not suffer it to be otherwise / but the next morning, to give content to the Imperialists, they yielded to make a verbal declaration among the allies, ‘ That they were resolved to

* make good all their treaties on occasion of ‘ this war, as well those that related to Spain

* as those made with Portugal, Prussia, Savoy,

* and others/ The British plenipotentiaries^ to give the like satisfaction, declared publicly at the conferences the same day, ‘ That as her ‘ majesty insisted for a just and reasonable satisfaction for all her allies, in conformity to ‘ all her alliances, those that might concern

* Spain and the Indies were understood there-

* by, as well as others that concerned the in-

* terest of the rest of the allies / wherewith the Austrian and -Portugal ministers seemed satisfied; nor did they request any thing further from the said bishop and earl oil that

- head. And therefore he humbly apprehends, that, in the negotiatioiff he neither declined to insist that Spain and the West Indies should not be allotted to the House of Bourbon as far as his instructions directing him to act in concert with the rest of the allies, required, nor refused to join with the Imperial and Portugal ministers, or either of them, to strengthen that demand in such manner as was proper, but in this, and all other matters, he pursued with constancy the orders he from time to time received from her majesty, as the nature and

. circumstances of things would give- leave; and In case her late majesty found it impracticable to persist in ber first designs of gaining Spain and the West Indies from the House of Bourbon, and thought other expedients for preventing the union of the two monarchies of Spain and France, might as Well answer the ends of

her several alliances, and did thereupon enter into measures for obtaining a general peace in which her allies concurred; the said earl hopes, that his conforming himself to the measures not only prescribed by her majesty, whose minister he was, and whom it was his duty to obey, but also approved by both Houses of Parliament, will not be esteemed an acting in defiance of the treaties between her majesty and her allies, in contempt of the advice or opinion of parliament, or in violation of his instructions:and he cannbt entertain such diffidence of your lordships justice and goodness as to suspect that his actions, ' which proceeded, from a principle of obedience to his sovereign, and zeal for the public service, should be condemned as perfidious or unwarrantable. And the said earl denies that, by any of his practices any jealousies or discords were created between her majesty and her allies, the mutual confidence between them was dissolved, the'just balance of power in Europe betrayed, or any advantage given to the common enemy to impose what terms of peace he should think fit upon her majesty or any of the confederates* .

“ In Answer to the Fifth Article; the said earl doth acknowledge, that her late majesty* in her speech from the throne, on the seventh day of December 1711, having acquainted her Parliament, ‘ That both time and place were.

* appointed for opening a treaty of peace/ did at the same time remind them, That the best

* way to make the treaty effectual would be to ‘ make early provision for the campaignand believes supplies were granted, and magazines provided, for that end:bat the said earl saith That, at the time in the said Article for that purpose mentioned, he was not informed o£ any reasonable prospect the confederates then, had of gaining new conquests over the army of France; nor doth he believe that the confederate army at that time was the strongest; that had been in the service during the whole course of the war; but upon the informations he received at the Hague* about the. 19-30th of April 1712, he understood, that the French were better posted than the confederates, and their army stronger; and that the confederate forces could not march to surprise the French in their lines till they had green forage, which would not be up in the three weeks at soonestj and that the French had all their troops, and the confederates wanted great part of thejrs, especially the Imperialists, who it was thought could not, and in fact did not, join the army till about a month after; and the said earl conceiving the treaty of peace in so great forwardness, that, by a constant application of the plenipotentiaries, it might probably be brought to a conclusion in a month's time; he did, upon these considerations, apprehend it would not have been any disservice to the common cause if a cessation of arms for a' month bad been then agreed en, during which time the negotiation might have been ended one way or other; and he believes that, according to his

SCI] PAUL. HISTORY, 2 George I, 1716. — t6 the Articles of Impeachment* [263

duty, he might about that time, in a letter to "her majesty’s secretary of sttfte, send an account of the posture and condition of the two armies; but denies that he took upon him to counsel or advise on that subject, but only proposed the matter for further deliberation in England, if upon those or other accounts such a short cessation should be thought necessary; much less did he then, or at any other time, suggest or advise any cessation of arms to' be made with France, without or against’ the consent of the allies, or with design to disappoint any just expectation they might have, or to give success to any secret or wicked negotiations whatsoever; and he is not yet sensible that a cessation for a month, at that time, could have beenauy bin-derance or prejudice to the cause of the allies, or have given the least advantage to the enemy: however, in fact, no cessation was made upon his said letter. The said earl saith he doth not know, or believe, that, in pursuance of any counsel or advice given by him, any directions were sent to her majesty’s general in Flanders, to avoid engaging in any siege, or hazarding a battle; nor was he privy to the sending any such directions; and he denies that he advised her late, majesty to send any person, much less himself, from England, to the army in Flanders, to cause a cessation of arms to be made or proclaimed, between her majesty and the French army; but acknowledges that, he being her majesty’s ambassador, she was pleased to give him orders and instructions, under ber sign manual, dated the 21st day of June 1712, whereby be was (commanded ‘ to make all possible dispatch to

* the army in the Low Countries; and, upon

* his arrival there, to inform her general and commander in chief of the resolutions takeu in the then important conjuncture of affairs,

4 and also to declare to the generals and cora- manders in chief of the foreign troops in her majesty’s pay, and in the joint pay of her raa-

* jesty and the States General, with how much

* surprise her majesty heard there was the least

* doubt of their obeying such orders as they should receive from her said general; and likewise commanding the said earl to continue with the said army, till the affair of the suspension of arms and the surrender of Dunkirk were determined one way or other; ’ and fhat thereupon he resorted to the Hague, and there, in conjunction with his colleague the then lord bishop of Bristol, acquainted the States General with her majesty’s intentions for a short cessation of arms between the armies in fche Netherlands, upon certain conditions to be performed by France, one of which was, the surrendry of Dunkirk into her majesty’s possession; inviting the States to join with her fnajesty therein. After this, the said earl proceeded to the army, and acted conformably to his said instructions; and hopes, that what was the performance of his duty, will not be imputed to him as a crime: but the said earl denies that any cessation or separation of the troops was executed or performed by his ad-

vice; nor was he otherwise concerned therein than in signifying the orders he had in command from her majesty to her general; and he believes, from the best judgment he can make upon the then situation of affairs, that, if the cessation that was made by her majesty had been generally complied with by the rest of the army, it would have increased the confidence between her majesty and her allies, and have obliged the French king more speedily to comply with their demands in the negotiations of peace; and that the most promising ex-

Sectations from the operations of the campaign uring those two months for which the cessation was to continue, could not equal the advantage accruing to the confederates by the surrender of the important fortress of Dunkirk, which was put into her majesty’s hands as one ef the conditions of it.

w In Answer to the Sixth Article; the said earl, not admitting that he did advise or procure a cessation of arms, or obtain for France any separation of the troops of Great Britain from the confederate army, or was otherwise concerned therein than as in his Answer to the preceding Article is set forth, denies, with a just abhorrence, that he ever had any treacherous purposes to advance or promote the interests of France, or to render any future correspondence or harmony between her late majesty and the States General impracticable, or to weaken or distress the said States, or bring them under any necessity of complying with, qr submitting to, the measures of France; nor did or doth he know, or believe, that the taking possession of Ghent and Bruges by the British troops was likely to produce any such consequence; on the contrary, he conceives, that it was very much for the advantage of the allies, especially the States General, that the English took possession of those towns, which would otherwise, in all probability, have fallen into the hands of the French:the said carl doth acknowledge, that, when the British troops were left by the other forces who separated from them and were under a necessity of retiring to some

Elace of security, and it was reported that the >utch bad given orders to all the commanders of the towns, in their possession to refuse them admittance or passage, he did not think the resolution improper, which was taken by. her majesty’s general, to send a party of the queen’s troops to march through some part of those towns, tp make experiment whether they would refuse them passage; for, if passage should not be refused them, the Dutch would be vindicated from the report which had been given out, so highly reflecting on their honour, and so repugnant to the repeated professions and assurances of that good-will, and friendship they had so constantly declared for Great Britain; and if such passage should be refused, it would demonstrate the necessity the English troops were under of resorting to Ghent and Bruges:however, the said earl doth not admit that he did advise therein; much less had he any such

SG3] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George!. 1716. — [264

hopes or treacherous designs as in the said article are mentioned; nor did he seek any pretence to put in execution any design or resolution concerted with the ministers of France; nor was any such design or resolution, to his knowledge or belief, concerted; the said earl doth believe, that a party of the queen’s troops, being sent with intentions to obtain admittance into soirie of the towns in Flanders, where some of the English magazines and hospitals were, or at least to obtain a passage through them to some other, places of'security, were refused by the Dutch commanders, although thqae towns had been conquered chiefly by British blood and treasure:but the States General disavowed their giving any orders for that purpose; and thereby rescued themselves from the reproach of an usage, that might have been thought inhuman to confederate troops, who had spent their blood for their service, and had done no act of hostility, nor given any just reason to the States to apprehend any ill consequences from such passage or admittance. The said earl doth acknowledge, that, after this refusal of the Dutch commanders to receive any of the queen’s troops into, or permit them to pass through the towns in their possession, they retired into Ghent and Bruges; the former having been their usual quarters, and the citadel thereof having been garrisoned by them from the beginning of the campaign:but the said earl does not know, or believe there was any tfeacherous or destructive design in the marching of those troops into, or taking possession of, those towns:nor doth he know, or believes it was done in concert with any of the ministers of France, who, he is confident, were not privy to, or knew any thing of it, till after it was executed; nor doth the said earl discern how it contributed to the prejudice of the confederates, or advantage of the -French army:but, on the contrary, the said earl is very well assured, that it proved greatly to the advantage and security of the former, whose convoys were thereby protected, and the communication between Holland and the confederate army kept open; and the advantages thereby to the common-cause were so notorious and visible, that the allies frequently expressed their satisfaction that those important placed had been so well secured, by which means the allies had all the advantages of those towns without being at the expence nfgurrisons, the furnishing of which would have obliged them to make such detachments from their army as would have rendered it difficult for them to have kept the field; and, ort the other hand, the French ministers frequently complained of the great disadvantages occasioned thereby to the arms of their master, whom they thought not w ell treated by her ma-

Son that account: and the said earl appre-Is, that the British troops had equal right with those of the States, to enter into Ghent and Bruges, or any other place of the Low Countries, Which by agreement were under the joint government of the queen and the States General; and this happened at that time to be

of the greater importance, since the queen’s troops were thereby enabled to maintain a communication with Dunkirk and England; and was afterwards found likewise very useful, towards obtaining the removal of the unjustifiable impositions laid by the Dutch upon the British merchandize in the new conquests in the Netherlands, which they themselves had many months owned to be a grievance, but had not before thought fit to redress.

“The said Earl humbly hopes, he has fully answered the several Articles exhibited against him; and he doubts not but your lordships will, in your great wisdom, maturely weigh the nature of the charge, which is chiefly founded on his transactions abroad with the ministers of foreign princes and states, whose testimony, though never so material towards clearing his innocence, it will be impossible for him to produce: he assures himself, your lordships will have a due regard to the wide extent, the great length and intricacy, of the negociations wherein he was engaged by his late sovereign’s express commands; to whfch he did the more cheerfully submit, being Joined in the most considerable parts thereof with a reverend prelate, whose long residence abroad, and experience in the methods of treating with foreign princes and states, had abundantly qualified him for the discharge of so important a trust. However the said earl on his part may in any respect have been unequal to the province assigned him; yet sure he is, that he always endeavoured to acquit himself therein with the utmost integrity; and cannot but express a just detestation of the many evil intentions wherewith he is loaded by the said Articles, and, as he humbly apprehends the several facts mentioned in the Articles (if they could be proved) will not appear criminal abstracted from the ill motives and designs from which they are supposed to proceed; so, he is fully persuaded, your lordships will distinguish between the actions themselves and the intentions wherewith they are charged to be done; and he assures himself, that your lordships wilt judge of the sincerity of his intentions by the tenor of all his letters and papers, and not by any particular passages selected from them; and is secure in your lordships justice, that no strained construction of any such passages will be made by your lordships to his prejudice. He cannot but think himself extremely unfortunate, in falling under the displeasure of the* honourable House of Commons; nor could he receive the first intimation of it without the greatest surprize, uot being conscious to himself that he had transgressed any known law. He w as not without hopes, having spent the best a»d greatest part of his life abroad in the army and in several embassies, always endeavouring to promote the welfare of his country, that he might at his return have met with its approbation, ax a recompence for his long and faithful services; however, he comforts himselfwi h this reflection that every step of his proceedings in the lat *

negociation wax laid before her majesty, and

2tS51 PAUL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 1716.* — The Earl of Derwentwaicr’s Answer. [266

received her royal approbation:nor will it, he Conceives, be judged improper, if he observes to your lordships, that the States General, in their letter to her majesty, a little before the signing the peace, acknowledged they could not enough commend her plenipotentiaries, for the assistance they had given them in their treaty with .France; and that all the Allies gave frequent marks of their esteem for the said earl and his colleague, on account of the many services they had received from them. The said earl is confident, it will appear to your lordships, that although he did, with the utmost application, pursue the good of his own country preferably to that of any other nation whatsoever, yet he was never wanting to promote the advantage of the Allies, particularly of the States General, where it did not interfere with the interest of Great Britain. A separate treaty of peace was so far from his thoughts, that, on the contrary, he was truly zealous to make it general; and he had the happiness to succeed therein, in as great a degree as' was ever known, when so many confederates were concerned; nor was the said earl less zealous in supporting, to the utmost of his abilities, the honour and reputation of his late royal mistress, which was so far from being prostituted, or suffering any diminution, by his negotiations, that her majesty did through the whole course of those negotiations, and to the very hour of her death, maintain as great and glorious a character as any of her royal predecessors, or as she herself had done in any former part of her reign.

“And as to all other matters and things in the said Articles contained, and not herein before particularly answered; the said earl saith, he is Not Guilty of them, or any of them, in the manner and form astlie same are charged upon him in and by the said Articles; and humbly submits himself to your lordships judgment.

The Earl of Derwentwater’s Answer to the Articles of Impeachment. | The said earl of Derwentwater was brought up to the bar, by the gentleman Usher of the Black Rod; where he'kneeled until the lord chancellor directed him to rise. And his lordship acquainted him witlr the above mentioned order; and demanded of him, If he was ready to put ili his Answer ?’ which he said, he was/ And delivering the same at the bar; tt was read as follows:

/

“The ANSWER of JAMES, Earl of DERWENTWATER, to the Articles of Impeachment of High Treason exhibited against him by the honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, of Great Britain, in Parliament assembled.

“ To a charge of so high and heinous a nature, the said earl cannot answer without the deepest concern and affliction; which becomes more weighty from the share the honourable House of Commons have been pleased to take in the accusation. He assures himself, however, that great assembly doth not engage in the prosecution of an offence, so open to conviction in the ordinary coarse of law, with design to in tercept that mercy, which the earl, from the reportof his majesty’s natural goodness, had reason to expect: it would be a thought unworthy any member of that august body, to imagine he could have the least desire of spilling the blood of any of his fellow subjects, ' whom his majesty’s great wisdom should think a fit object of his mercy. The said earl therefore hopes that his prosecution is' taken out of the common course of justice, with intentions, that if, in his particular case there shall appear any Circumstances inducing favour or compassion, both your lordships and the Commons may be intercessors with his majesty for grace towards him; whereby the exercise of the royal mercy, upon which the earl depended (which amongst all the virtues of the crown, most endears a monarch to the love and affection of his people ), may be extended in such manner, as may demonstrate that clemency for which his majesty is so greatly renowned, and -not encourage any to offend upon the presumption of it for the future. The said earl acknowledges, with a real sorrow, that, at the time in the Articled mentioned, he was in arms, and with others did march through and invade several parts of this kingdom; and confesses he is thereby guilty of the offence wherewith he is charged in the said Articles. But, if any one offence of that kind was ever attended with circumstances which might move compassion, the said earl hopes he may be entitled to it. He begs leave to inform your lordships, that his temper and inclination disposed him to live peaceably und# r his majesty’s government, and he never had the least prejudice or malice against his person; nor was he ever heretofore concerned in, or privy to, any design or contrivance to subvert or distort) the established government, the laws or reiigiou of this kingdom; and, if any methods were taken by others to' accomplish any of those ends, he was absolutely a stranger to them; nor did he now engage in this unhappy undertaking upon any previous concert or contrivance for any such purpose; but being young and unexperienced, be rashly, and without any deliberation, engaged himself to meet at Plaine-field* in Northumberland, on assurance that many of his relations and acquaintance would

appear there. That his tindertaking was sudden, appears that he engaged in it without any previous preparation of men, horses, arms, or other warlike accoutrements. And as the said earl cannot be justly reproached with any cruel, severe, or harsh action, during the continuance in arms; so he took the first opportunity that offered of submitting to the king’s mercy. After the sudden skirmishes at Preston, the said eari, with others, was solicitous to prevent any further destruction of the lives of his majesty’s subjects, and instrumental to induce all in arms to submit themselves to the king, provided they might be secured of their lives:one of his majesty’s officers, sent from the general, gave them encouragement to believe, that the surrender of themselves would be the ready way to obtain the king’s mercy; in confidence whereof, when a cessation was agreed on, the said earl offered himself to become one of the hostages for them till the next morning; in which time he received further assurances from the officers, “ That the king was a prince of known clemency; that this was a distinguishing part of his character; and that the bee surrender to mercy would be the most proper means to obtain it.” The said earl bekeves his majesty’s officers were very sensible, and will be so just as to acknowledge, that it had not been impracticable for many of those at Prestoa to make their way through his majesty’s forces; but this attempt must have occasioned the loss of many lives, and might been productive of ill consequences to the government, which the said earl was desirous to prevent; and, when the time agreed on for the cessation was near expired, and general Wills seemed uneasy in not having received any message from those in the town, the said earl writ a letter, to exhort them to surrender to the king’s mercy; and, at the same time, declared to the said general and other officers, “ That whatever happened, he was determined to continue with them, and rely entirely on his majesty’s clemency, and goodness, which he had encouragement to expect.” And, in such circumstances, the said earl cannot distrust your lordships or the Commons’ readiness to use their mediation for mercy on his behalf; which will lay him under the highest obligations of duty and affection to Ilia majesty, and perpetual gratitude to both Houses of Parliament. Derwent water.”

The material words of which Answer appearing not to be sufficiently express and clear; the Lord Chancellor asked the said earl, If he meant, by the said Answer, to plead Guilty to the said Articles of Impeachment ?” He says He does; and submits to the king's mercy; and humbly desires their lordships intercession to his majesty and his said Answer and Plea is recorded accordingly. And be withdrew.

and asked the same question as the earl of Derwentwater. He likewise delivered in his Answer; which was read as follows:

The ANSWER of WILLIAM Lord WIDDRINGTON, to the Articles of Impeachment of High Treason exhibited against him, by the Honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, of Great Britain, in Parliament assembled.

“ It is with inexpressible concern and affliction the said lord appears before this august assembly, charged with crimes of the most heinous nature:and though it is natural to mankind to endeavour to conceal their guilt, and make use of all manner of defence, especially in the case of life; yet, as he surrendered himself at Preston, entirely relying on his majesty’s mercy:so he is now resolved not to take any measures which may argue the least diffidence of that mercy, or of your lordships goodness; and therefore, the said lord confesses, he is Guilty of the Treason wherewith he is charged in the said Articles. And, after having thus freely acknowledged lus offence, he begs leave to lay his case before your lordships; and humbly hopes, when the particular circumstances are considered, it will not be thought to merit the most rigorous punishment; but that both your lordships and the honourable House of Commons will look upon him as a proper object of his majesty’s clemency:And he humbly hopes, he may be thought the less unworthy of favor, in that ne never before offended, nor was at any time privy to, or acquainted with, any design, or contrivance, to destroy, or disturb, the established government, the laws, or religion, of this kingdom:but came unawares into this sudden and unpremeditated action; for, although he hath met with public Tumours arid reports of intended invasions from abroad, and insurrections at home; yet he never knew, or any pother way heard, of any formed design against the government, till he was told, the night before, of a meeting intended at Plaine-field, in Northumberland, on the 6th of October last; and being soon after informed, that almost all his neighbours and acquaintance had met there in arms, he took a hasty and inconsiderate resolution of joining them: Nor was he in any sort prepared for such an undertaking, having only some of his own family with him, no arms but his common fowling pieces and wearing swords, and fewer horses than he had constantly kept for sevejpi years before; and. nothing but the report of so many of his friends being engaged could have hurried him on to an enterprize, so unaccountably rash ana unjustifiable. And he is willing to hope, your lordships will esteem it some alleviatiop of his crime, that, in a commotion of that nature, there was so little violation of the rights and properties of those who opposed them; for, he believes, few instances can be found, where such a multitude continued so long ia arms, without doing

litized by

S69] PAUL. HISTORY, 2 George I.17

greater acts of violence arid injustice. The said lord cannot charge himself with any injurious acts to the property of his fellow subjects, and endeavoured to prevent them in others; and hopes it was therice owing, in some measure, that there was shown all along greater marks of moderation and humanity than is common in such a warlike and hostile proceeding. The suddenness of the attack at Preston, without any previous summons, admitted, no time for meditating a submission before the loss of that blood which was there unfortunately spilt; but, after the heat and sufprize of the first action was over, a cessation of arms was desired:and, upon the mutual messages Which then passed, the officer sent from the general encouraged them to believe the surrendering themselves would be the ready way to obtain the king’s mercy; and gave them repeated assurances, That they submitted to a prince of the greatest clemency in the world? Upon these hopes and assurances, they made a general surrender of themselves to the king. And the said lord may justly take notice to your lordships, that, as he was the last who took up arms, so be was the first who procured a meeting of the chief persons among them in order to lay them down; and canriot doubt but yoar lordships and the honourable House of Commons will think it equitable to make some distinction between an obstinate resistance and an early and homble submission* whereby the peace ana tranquillity of this part of his majesty’s dominions was entirely restored. Nature must have started at yielding themselves up to a certain and ignominious death; when it must be acknowledged, that it was not impracticable for many of them to have escaped:and it was possible so great a number, grown desperate, might have obtained farther success, and thereby prevented the so speedy suppressing that insurrection:But-the said lord and the rest having, with the utmost confidence, relied on the assurances of his majesty’s great clemency, and the hopes of mercy which had been given them from the officers- who commanded the royal forces; he is encouraged, with great earnestness, to implore the intercession of your lordships and the honourable House of Commons wit)i his majesty, for that mercy on which they wholly depended:and as be doth not know where mercy was refused to those who so early and with so much resignation submitted to so, he humbly hopes, your lordships may be induced to think that the exercise of this divine virtue, by his majesty, towards those who cast themselves at his royal feet upon the sole prospect and expectation of it, will appear no less glorious to his majesty, and prove no less advantageous to the future quiet and tranquillity of his government, than any examples of justice, in such a case, can, be likely to do:and whatever marks of goodness and favor his majesty shall vouchsafe to the said lord will not fail to engage him, by the strongest ties of gratitude, to demonstrate, in the future course of his life, the most constant and inviolable duty

to his majesty, and the most real esteem and veneration for your lordships and the honourable House of Commons. Widdrington.”

And the sai^ lord Widdrington being asked, “ If be had any thing further to say ?” He begged “ to be excused all imperfections in his said Answersays, “ he has been indisposed with the gout in his stomach, and was not able to employ himself in preparing his Answer tilt last night, and finished k but this morning; and humbly implores their lordships intercession to his majesty, for favour and mercyand his Answer and Plea is recorded accordingly. And he withdrew.

The Earl of Nithisdale’s Answer.} Then the earl of Nithisdale was brought to the Bar. And having there likewise kneeled, was acquainted with the forementioned Order, and asked the same question as the earl of Der* wentwater. And be also delivered in his Answer; which was read as follows:

The ANSWER of WILLIAM Earl of NITHISDALE, to the Articles Of Impeach* peachment of High Treason, exhibited against him by the honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, of Great Britain in Parliament assembled.

“ It is with the utmost confusion the said earl hppears at your lordships bar, under the weight of an Impeachment by the Commons of Great Britain, for High Treason. He humbly begs leave, in extenuation of his crime, to assure your lordships that be was always a zealous asserter of the liberties of his country, and never engaged in forming or carrying on any design to subvert the ancient established government, and the good laws of this kingdom: but being summoned by those entrusted with the administration of the government in Scotland, to appear at Edinburgh; and being assured, if he went thither, he should be made close prisoner; he did not obey the summons; but in all bumble manner, applied for their indulgence, in dispensing with his being committed to gaol: offering to give ally bail for his peaceable and quiet behaviour: which being refused s and being at that time in so ill a state of health, that a confinement in Edinburgh castle would have endangered his life; he was forced to ab-acorid and keep private, till several of the persons mentioned in the said Impeachment, with many others of his neighbours, appeared in arms, very near the place where the said earl lay concealed; and then he inconsiderately and unfortunately (with four of his domestics and no other person whatsoever) joined them, and proceeded in their company to the places in the said Articles of Impeachment mentioned; but he knew nothing of the intended insurrection till they were actually in arms. The said earl is deeply sensible of his great offence; and, not affecting delay, nor being willing to give your lordships or the honourable House of Coin-

271] PAUL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 17 J& — 7fe Earl WintonU Petition. [273

mpns any unnecessary trouble; he does, with a sorrow equal to his crime, confess that he is Guilty of the Treason in the said Articles of Impeachment contained; and throws himself at his majesty's feet, imploring his royal mercy: And, to incline his majesty thereto, and induce your lordships to recommend him as an object thereof, he begs leave to inform your lordships, that, when he and the rest that were with him at Preston had engaged in a battle, a cessation of arms being agreed to, they had intimations from his majesty's officers, ‘ That if they sub- mhted, they might expect the king's mercy ; ' and history abounding with instances of con* ditions, stipulated by generals, even with rebels, and afterwards agreed to and confirmed by their sovereigns, they were prevailed on by such encouragement, together with the const* deration of his majesty’s known clemency, to surrender themselves prisoners; whereby the lives of great numbers of his majesty’s good subjects were saved, which, by an obstinate resistance, would inevitably have been destroyed:And therefore, he most humbly begs your lordships will be pleased to represent his case to his majesty in the most favourable manner; not doubting but, by your lordships powerful intercession, he shall find, that as The performed the duty of a good Christian in concurring to prevent the effusion of blood, so be actea the part of a wise man in relying upon a mercy so extensive ai that of his majesty. And he presumes, when the honourable House of Commons are apprised of the nature of his case, they will not interpose, to prevent him from having a share in the benefit of that mercy.

' Nituisdale.”

And the said earl of Nithisdale being asked, u If he had any thing further to say ?" He says, “ He has nothing, but to implore the King's mercy.". And his Answer and Plea is recorded accordingly. And be withdrew.

The Earl of Winton's, for other

Counsel; and further time alloyed him to -noer.] Then the earl of Wintonwas brought to the bar. And, having there likewise kneeled, was acquainted by the Lord Chancellor with the forementioned Order, and asked the same question as the earl of Derwentwater. He said, u He had a Petition to present to the House; he was an entire stranger to the nature of their lordships proceedings: and desired his Petition might oe read." And thp same was read, as follows:

44 To the right honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled* ' The humble Petition of George Earl of WlNTOUN;

* Humbly sheweth;

“ That, on Thursday last, I having applied to your lordships, representing how I had caused application to be made to two lawyers, to act as counsel for me, in the Impeachment exhibited before your lordships against roe by

the honourable House of Commons; and that they both declined to meddle, for reasons then given; your lordships were pleased to allow me some more time for nominating of counsel and solicitors, and this day for giving in my Answers; but, by reason of my close confinement, and that your lordships order for allowing some persons to have access to me expired on Friday last, at eleven forenoon; I have had no opportunity of naming other counsel and solicitors; nor can I have the assistance of any, till they are appointed by your lordships, and they allowed access to me. — That your petitioner has several specialities and matters of great moment, which he conceives necessary to be a part of his Answers, and which cannot be drawn into form without the assistance of his counsel and solicitors. — Forasmuch, therefore, as this affair is to me of the greatest importance; may it please your lordships, to assign sir Constantine Phipps and Mr. Peer Williams to be coonset, and Charles Menzies and Mr. James Lesslie to be my solicitors, and to order that they may have access to me from time to time, during my trial; as also that your lordships would be pleased to allow Mr. George Hereot, a minister of the church of England, to have access to me from time to time, seeing I am confined in a room alone.

Then he was again called in. And the Lord Chancellor acquainted him, “ That the House had considered his Petition; and assigned him the counsel he desired, and would assign him either of the two solicitors be should choose; and that the clergyman abovementioned might come to him, upon the condition before expressed." — Then the said earl of Wintoun naming Mr. Menzies, the House accordingly assigned him for his solicitor; and ordered that the said counsel and solicitor may have access ta him from time to time, at all seasonable hours. And he withdrew.

And as to* the Articles of Impeachment exhibited against him; he says, he is Guilty of the High Treason contained in the said Articles.'* And his Plea is recorded accordingly.

Then he delivered in a Petition, at the bar; and the same was read, as follows:

“ To the right honourable the Lords spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled, the humble Petition of Willi ah Lord Nairn e;

“ Sheweth,

“ That your petitioner was educated, and hath always continued, a Protestant, according to the discipline of the church of England; aim though, by reason of some mistaken principles he unwarily imbibed in his tender years, he did not in aU respects conform to the late Revolution, lying under the less necessity, for that he had married an heiress, in whom all the right of your petitioner's estate is invested; and though be never took the oaths, yet he always peaceably submitted to, and lived quietly under, the government as by law established, until the breaking out of this rebellion, in which your petitioner was inadvertently involved; hut not before the lord Mar and his adherents bad for a considerable time, made themselves masters •f Perth and Duakeld, and thereby surrounded your petitioner's whole estate, and came to your petitioner's bouse lying i» the middle between those places.

44Yonr petitioner heartily repents of this nth undertaking, and solemnly declares, be knew nothing of any previous consultations, or conspiracies in favour of the Pretender, before be actually appeared ia acme; aer knew any

\

thing about crossing the Forth, until the morning he was 9ent over under JVPIntoch’s command; and then was so far from approving of that expedition, that though, to avoid the imputation of cowardice, he would hazard his own person therein; your petitioner ordered back all his dependants, and was Only attended by his son and four servants, who would not leave him in a time of danger, though often desired: Nor was your petitioner pi ivy to any designs of marching into England; for, having been bred a seaman, he had no pretensions to knowledge in the land service.

“ Your petitioner, being now sensible of his errors, hath pleaded Guilty to the Articles of Impeachment ofHighTreason, exhibited against him by the honourable House of Commons, and thrown himself at his majesty's feet; humbly beseeching your lordships, in commisera* tion of the deplorable circumstances of your petitioner and his twelve children, to recommend him to his majesty for that irercy, which, at the time of his surrender, he was made to believe he might reasonably expect.

M This will lay your petitioner and hist posterity under the greatest obligations of duty and gratitude to his majesty, and bind them for ever to hless your lordships, as the merciful instruments of procuring such a gracious deliverance. And your petitioner shall ever pray, &c.

* (Nairne." ,

And being asked, “ If he had any thing farther to say r" He said, “ he had not." And withdrew.

Then the House was informed, “ That on the day the said several lords were brought before to this House, nowithstanding their lordships order, That no person should have admittance to them without the special leave of the House, it was reported, and believed, that, on their return to the Tower, they were allowed to dine at a tavern, and suffered to continue there for some time."

Thereupon the Lieutenant of the Tower was called in, and examined touching the same; and acknowledged, “ That the said lords, complaining they were faint, at their request, were permitted to go into the Fountain tavern in the Strand, and stayed about half an hour, during which time they were strictly guarded." And then he withdrew.

Ordered, That the said several lords be carried directly to the Tower when they go from hence; and if they desire any refreshment they take it here. And the said Lieutenant was called in, and acquainted with the said Order.

hath recorded: And, upon the petition of XJeorge, earl of Winton, their lordships have allowed him time till Monday next, to put in his answer to the said Articles.

The Impeached Lords sent back to the Tower.] Ordered, That the several lords impeached be conveyed back to his majesty’s Tower of London, by the Lieutenant thereof, to be there kept in safe custody i And that the said Lieutenant do bring George eafl o£ Winton to this Hodse, on Monday next, at 12 o’clock, in order to his putting in his Answer to the Articles of Impeachment of High Treason, exhibited against him by the House of Commons.

Debate on a Clause proposed to be added to the Bill for• suspending the Habeas Corpus .Act, ] January 21. The Lords, in a committee of the whole House, took into consideration the Bill from the Commons “ For continuing the Act to impower his Majesty to secure and detain suspected persons, &c.” and lord Har-court proposed a clause, “ For assigning the reason of the commitment; and for punishing Informers in case they accuse innocent persons; as also for excepting Peers out of this Act.” He was backed by lord Trevor, the duke of Buckingham, and the earl ‘of Abingdon, but the question being put thereupon, it was carried in the negative by 64 voices against 14: after which the Bill was read the third time, and passed without amendment.

Protest on rejecting the said Clause.] Hereupon the following Protest was entered:

“ Dissentient’ N

u 1. Because some provisions, which, in former bills of this nature, were thought necessary to prevent unjust imprisonment, are omitted in this.

<(2. Because the manner of continuing the suspension, by reference only, deprived this House of the opportunity freely to debate the several parts of the act so continued.

u 3. Because by this bill the liberty of the subject is in greater danger, than if the act suspended wete totally repealed.

“ 4. Because no provision is made in this act for restraining the extravagant execution of the povter given to ministers, who are, like other men, subject to passion and revenge, at whose will and pleasure the most dutiful and loyal subjects may be deprived of their liberty, and all conversation with their best friends and dearest relations; which-may tend to alienate from his majesty their affections, the best security' against invasions from abroad or rebellion at borne.

u5. Because, though it may be^Kcessary, in this time of danger, to continue the suspension of the said act, with proper provisions, yet not for so long a time as is proposed by this bijl, while the parliament is like to continue sitting. *

“ 6. Because the antient rights and privileges of parliament, particularly for preventing the imprisonmeat of members of both Houses, are

not by this act sufficiently provided for, which may intimidate the members from using freedom of speech in parliament, so necessary for advising his majesty and for restraining th« exorbitant power of evil ministers.

“ Abikgdok.* ’

Debate in the Commons concerning the Bill for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act.] The said Bill had been strenuously, opposed in the Commons;

. Mr. Shippen made a speech against it, in which he insisted, “ That it invaded the most valuable right of English subjects, encouraged malicious mformatioas, and gave a handle to those, in power to oppress innocent persons; he therefore moved to have a clause inserted in it, to prevent illegal imprisonments, and for the better securing the liberty of the subject in cases not within the purport of the said act.” He was answered by

Mr. Secretary Stanhope, who endeavoured to shew the necessity of the said act, at a time of open rebellion; and appealed to the whole House, whether, the king or his ministers bad made an ill or a wanton use of the power with which the parliament had thought fit to intrust his majesty. — And-the question being put upon Mr. Shippen’s motion, it (passed in the negative.

The King's Speech relating to the Pretender* heading the Rebellion in Scotland.] The King having given the royal assent to the said Bill, the Lord Chancellor, by his majesty’s command, read the following Speech to both Houses:

* My Lords and Gentlemen;

“ I had reason to believe, nhen I spoke last to you, that the Pretender was landed in Scotland; the accounts I have received since do put it beyond all doubt, that he is heading the rebellion there, and does assume the stile and title of king of these realms; his adherents do likewise confidently affirm, that assurances are given them of support front'abroad. This parliament hath, on all occasions, expressed so much duty to me, and so true a regard for the religious and civil rights of my people, that I am persuaded this daring presumption of our enemies will heighten your just indignation against them, and beget such farther resolutions as, with the blessing of God, wilTeoable me to defeat their attempts.

“ Gentlemen of the Houte of Commons;

il The most effectual way to put a speedy end to these troubles will be to make such a provision as may discourage any foreign power from assisting the rebels; I do therefore hope, that every sincere Protestant and true Briton will look upon the extraordinary expence, which a timely preparation may require, to be the best husbandry, since it will, in all human probability, prevent that desolation and those cap 1 amities, which would unavoidably ensue, if th« rebellion should be suffered to spread, and be supported by Popish forces from abroad.

The Lords' Address the.] The King being retired, the Lords ordered. That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, on this occasion; and a committee being appointed, the Address was the same day reported, read; and agreed to; and, on the 2Sd the House waited on his majesty with the said Address, as follows:

“ Moat Gracious Sovereign;

* We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects the Lords spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled, beg leave to assure your majesty, that the landing of the Pretender m this kingdom, hath increased our indignation against him and his adherents; and that we are fully convinced that it is not only requisite for the security, but also for the future ease and interest of your majesty’s subjects, to exert themselves on this occasion in a more than ordinary manner, to put a speedy end to these present disorders, and to prevent those calamities which must attend a lingering rebellion within the kingdom, and to discourage its being ported by any assistance from abroad:and that we will, to the utmost of our power, assist your majesty, not only in subduing the present rebellion, ' but in destroying the seeds and causes of it, that the like disturbance may never rise again to impair the blessings of your majesty’s reign." *

The King's Answer.] To this his majesty returned the following Answer;

“ My Lords; x

“This Address is afresh instance of your duty and affection to my person, and government, and of your just and tender concern for the safety of my people. The vigour and resolution you express on this occasion will, I hope, contribute very much to the putting a speedy and effectual end to this rebellion."

' Thfi Commons' Address.] January 24. The Commons presented an Address to the king as follows:

uMost Gracious Sovereign;

«< We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, do, with all humility, return our unfeigned thanks for your majesty's boost gracious speech from the throne, and for your great goodness in communicating to us those important advices which so highly concern the immediate safety of your kingdoms.

“ We can never sufficiently express our grateful senye of your majesty’s constant care and tenderness for your people on every occasion, since your accession to the throne of your

ancestors; .but it js with the utmost satisfaction of heart, that we now experience the happy effects of that just confidence which your loyal and affectionate Commons have already reposed in your great wisdom, for making such augmentation of troops as your majesty should find necessary for our common safety: and though the growth of the rebellion has already necessitated ao increase of forces; yet we must ever acknowledge your wise and tender concern for your people, in having made provision for our defence in such a manner at this time of common danger, as must convince the world, that it is with the utmost reluctancy to your majesty, that any farther burthens are brought on your subjects; and that your majesty has nothing at heart, but the security and welfare of our people.

“ Your dutiful Commons do likewise acknowledge, wilh the highest gratitude to your majesty, that by the prudent disposition of your forces, not only the designs of our enemies to have raised insurrections in many parts of the kingdom have been entirely frustrated, and the peace and tranquillity of these nations thereby in a great measure, preserved; but to that we owe, under God, those signal successes which have checked the progress of the Rebellion, and which have given us, your faithful Commons, so early and just an occasion to exert ourselves io jthe most vigorous and effectual manner, for bringing some of the chief actors to condign punishment. We are astonishefl at the daring presumption of the Pretender and his adherents, and do most sincerely and heartily assure your majesty, that our indignation is hereby height* ened against them; and that we cannot so fur forget our duty and affection to your majesty, and our concern for our religion and liberties, as not to take at this critical juncture, such farther resolutions, as will enable your majesty, with the blessing of God, to 'defeat their designs. Your faithful Commons being therefore firmly and unalterably resolved to spare no expence, and to decline no hazard for the support of your majesty’s title and government, whereon all that is dear -and valuable to os and our posterities, under God, entirely depends; and^ being most earnestly desirous to give all imaginable proofs of our constant and-unshaken zeal and affection for your sacred person, and being thoroughly convinced that we cannot more effectually consult our own-security, than by testifying our entire confidence in your majesty’s known justice, wisdom and goodness, do most humbly beseech your majesty, that you will be graciously pleased to give directions, from time to time, for such farther augmentation of troops as the exigency of affairs shall render necessary.

“ And we farther assure your majesty, that we will grant such supplies as 'shall be sufficient not only to maintain such additional forces, and to defeat all attempts of your fenemies, both at home and abroad, and to prevent those calamities which mus£ ensue, if this unnatural Rebellion be suffered to spread; but

also to enable your majesty, with the blessing of God, effectually to shew your resentment against any foreign power, that shall presume directly or indirectly, to abet or support the Pretender or his adherents.

The King’* Answer.] To this Address the King answered:

“ pcntlemen:

" 1 thank you heartily for this Address. If any thing could add to the good opinion this House of Commons deserves from me, it would be the zeal and unanimity you have shewn upon this occasion. You may depend upon my continuing always as I have hitherto done, to make use of the confidence and powers you pat in me only for restoring and securing the peace and quiet of my people.”

Judgment demanded against the Rebel Lords.] Jan. 23. The House of Lords being informed, That the Commons, with their Speaker, were at the door; They were called in; and Mr. Speaker said,

“My Lords: By command of the House of Commons, I do, in the name of themselves and of all the Commons of Great Britain, demand judgment against James earl of Derwentwater, William lord Widdrington, William earl of Nithisdale, Robert earl of Carnwath, William viscount Kentnure, and William lbrd Nairn, impeached by the Commons of High Treason, of which they have confessed themselves Guilty.” And then they withdrew.

Ordered, that, to, morrow morning, this House shall be put into a Committee of the whole House, to consider of the forms and methods of proceeding to judgment, in a case of such nature as that of the six lords who have pleaded Guilty to the Impeachment of the House of Commons, and that the Judges do then attend.

The Earl of Wintoun’s Answer to the Articles of Impeachment.] The Earl of Wintoun delivered in, at the bar, his Answer in writing. Which was read as follows;

M'The ANSWER of GEORGE Earl of WINTOUN, to tbd Articles of Impeachment exhibited against him by the honourable House of Commons, for High Treason and other High Crimes and Misdemeanors,

u The said earl, saving to himself all benefit of exception to the incertaiutie.s and insufficiencies in the said Articles of Impeachment c6ntained, and also ail advantages and privi* leges belonging to hirn as a peer of Great Britain, for answer to the said Articles, says, that be cannot but esteem it the greatest addition to his afflictions, to fall under the displeasure of the honourable House of Commons s yet, as his innocence under these misfortunes is his support, so +ie hopes it will be his security. He, being taken with persons that were in arms against the government, might reasonably be presumed to be equally guilty, and to be

justly joined with them in the same Impeach* meat; but when it shall appear how mnch the circumstances of his case differ from others, he does not doubt but your lordships great justice will distinguish him in judgment: and that it will be as pleasing to that honourable body who are bib accusers, to have an innocent man acquitted, as one that is guilty condemned. He begs leave to take notice, that he is descended from a very ancient, noble family, in whose blood the streams of loyalty were always pure, never corrupted or polluted with treason or sedition:and be never degenerated so much from his loyal ancestors, as to form or carry on any design to subvert or alter the constitution of these kingdoms; but, for the preservation of it, was upon all occasions ready to sacrifice his fortune, and even his life. He was so cautious to avoid giving occasion to be suspected by the government, that about eight years ago upon his return from his travels, he withdrew from all conversation, and confined himself to his house; never corresponded by letter with any person whatsoever:Yet, to his great misfortune, be could not be quiet or safe in his closet retirement: for many persons, both of-. ficers and others of the militia of the shire of Lothian, under the specious pretence of serving the government, but in reality actuated by private pique and revenge, several times, contrary to lafr, forcibly entered by night into his dwelling-house called Seaton Palace, rifled it, turned his servants out of doors, and carried away the provisions of his family:The most sacred places did not escape their fury and resentment; they broke into his chapel, defaced the monuments of his ancestors, took up the stones of their sepulchres, thrust irons through their bodies, and treated them in a most barbarous, iuhuman, and unchristianlike manner cannon and mortars were brought to demolish his house; and several troops of dragoons having got the possession thereof, some of them kept guard there; and when they left it, many of the militia entered, and kept possession thereof till they were driven from thence by the Highlanders; by whom he was likewise very ill treated, he being the only person that was plundered by them. By these and many other severities, the said earl was forced to leave hi* house, and seek for shelter among his tenants and neighbours, where he was pursued from house to house: and at last very unfortunately driven into the company of some of the gentlemen named in the Impeachment. He presumes to affirfo to your lordships, that he did not join them with a traiterous or rebellious design; but only with au intention to preserve himself from being insulted and assassinated 3 for he had been occe before taken up without any warrant or authority, and having got from the persons in whose custody he was, they threatened, if they could retakehim, to murder him:and had before imbrued their hands in the blood of the son of a neighbouring gentleman. He never intended to have left his own country; and when some gentlemen mentioned

coming into England, he opposed it. He was

far from assisting or encouraging them in their secrets, nor informed of their designs; and was so much a stranger to their* proceedings, that, when they marched towards Northumberland, he was told, They were going along the skirts of the hills in Scotland, to avoid general Carpenterbut afterwards discovered they were in England, when it was too late; and to return alone into Scotland was too ha-(zardous; which he did not attempt, because he had reason to believe they would soon go back to Scotland.

“ Although he was constrained to keep the other lords and gentlemen company, yet he never joined with them in any act of hostility, nor assisted in taking any of the public money, or in seizing any guns or warlike instruments, ' or countenanced or abetted them therein. IJe did not, at Preston or elsewhere, fire a pistol, offer violence to any person whatsoever, or in tiny other manner fight against or resist his majesty’s forces; but with the rest surrendered himself to general Wills. The honour of a peer is more valuable than life itself; and therefore he ought to be so much the more cautious that it be not stained with the least imputation of guilt. The said earl knows his innocence; and hopes your lordships will excuse him, if, in justice to himself, and for the preservation of his honour, he does not take upon him the guilt of crimes, the very thoughts of which were always strangers to his breast: and therefore, in answer to the Impeachment, he says, That he isNot Guilty of the Treason and other the crimes and misdemeanors mentioned in the said Articles, or any of them, in manner and form as is therein alledged; and, f.; r his trial, puts himself on your lordships, who are his peers; and begs your lordships to believe, that this answer proceeds from the sense be has of the truth of it, and not from obstinacy, or any inclination to give your lordships and the honourable House of Commons any unnecessary trouble, or from the least doubt or mistrust of his majesty’s clemency; but if, upon this trial, it shall appear that he hath committed any act, which, in the rigour of the law, may be construed to amount to the crime, of high treason, he hopes the innocence of his, heart, and his ignorance of the law, will, by. the power of your lordships intercession, render him an object of his majesty’s mercy, which be and the rest, at the time of surrendering themselves, were encouraged by his majesty’s officers to depend upon.

“ The said earl submits his case, thus circumstanced, to your lordships great wisdom and judgment; and humbly prays your lordships favourable interpretation thereof; not doubting but to make his innocence appear to your lordships satisfaction. “ Wintoun.”

The impeached Lords .] u The im-

peached lords having thus pleaded guilty, ” •ays Tiudal, the 9th of February was appointed for their receiving sentence. Upon

which they were all brought to the bar of the court, erected in Westminster-hall, and had sentence, as in case of high-treason, pronounced against them by the lord chancellor Cowper, lord high steward on that occasion. Great solicitations were made with the court and with the members of both houses of parliament, in their behalf, particularly in favour of the earl of Derwentwater. On the l3th of February, the countess of Nithisdale and the lord Nairn's lady, patching an opportunity when the king went through the apartments of the palace, at St. James's, behind a window curtain, without being presented by the lord of the bed chamber in waiting, as usual, on a sudden threw themselves at the king's feet; begging mercy for their husbands. This abrupt and irregular application could not but surprize the king, and those about him, arid therefore proved as ineffectual as those, which had been made in a more becoming and artful manner. For a few days after a resolution was taken in council, to cause the sentence passed on these lords to be executed; for which purpose tha necessary warrants and orders were, on the 18th of February, sent, both to the lieutenant of the Tower, and to the sheriffs of the city of London and Middlesex. The next rooming the countess of Derwentwater, attended by her sister, and accompanied by the dutchesses of Cleveland and Bolton, and several other ladies of the first rank, was, by the dukes of Richmond and St. Albans, introduced into the king’s bed-chamber, where she humbly implored his clemency for her unfortunate con- sort: and then withdrew.

(t It is very probable, the countess of Derwentwater received no favourable answer from the court; for, on the 21st of February, sjie, with the ladies of some other condemned lords, and about 20 more of distinction, went to the lobby of the House of Peers to beg their intercession:but the Lords did not then think fit to take notice of their petitions. The next morning, the ladies in distress, with a still greater attendance than the day before, went to Westminster to petition both Houses of Par-: liament, where by this time, not a few members appeared inclined to mercy. Sir Richard Steele, among the rest, offered one of these petitions, and made a long speech on that subject, and was seconded by Mr. Farrer, Mr.

1 Shippen, and some others; but they were opposed by all the leading members of the prevailing side; and, though a great many who used to vote with them, went over on this occasion to the other party, yet a motion being made, and the question put for adjourning to the 1st of March, the adjournment was carried by a majority of seven voices only, 162 to 155.

“The ladies of the condemned lords were more successful with the Peers than with the Commons. The duke of Richmond, a near relation of the earl of Derwentwater, and one of the lords allowed by the House to assist him, could not refuse presenting a petition in his

favour, but at the same time he declared he would be against it. The earl of Derby, out of pity jot the numerous family of the lord Nairn, charged himself with a petition in his behalf, as otherlords did, upon the like or different motives, with other petitions. The question being put, whether these petitions should be received and read, there arose a great debate, iu which the lord Townshend, and several other lords, who upon all occasions had given - undoubted proofs of their affection to the pre-\ sent, settlement, were against it, but the earl of Nottingham, to their great surprise, declaring for it, his weight, as president of the council, drew to that side several Peers; so the question was carried by 9 or 10 voices* After the reading of the petitions, the next question was, whether, in the case of an impeachment, the king has.any power to reprieve? This being also carried in the affirmative, the same was followed by a motion for an Address, to desire the king to grant a reprieve to the lords, who lay under sentence of death. This was opposed by the firmest friends of the government; and even an earl, who was for the two first questions, represented, 4 That though clemency was one

* of the brightest virtues, that adorn and sup-

* port a crown; yet, in his opinion, the same

* should be exercised with discretion, and only (on proper objectsand. there fore moved That

* they should address the king to reprieve

* such of the condemned lords as. should deserve his mercy.' This, after some further debate, was carried. Then the earl of Stampford moved, that the time of respite be left to the king, which was readily agreed to; and then the address with these amendments, was carried by a majority of 5 voices only. To this Address the king answered, 4 That on this, and all

* other occasions, he would do what he thought most consistent.with the dignity of his crown,

* and the safety of his people. '

44 This wise and resolute answer proved, the next day, a great mortification to the jacobite and discontented party, who were extremely elated by the inclinations to mercy, which appeared in both Houses, and which occasioned various reflections. YVhatever was the secret spriqg of these inclinations, it is certain, that in the council, held the same evening, about the execution of the condemned lords, there was a contest between the earl of Nottingham and some other, lords, and four days after, that earl was removed from being president of the council, the earl of Aylesford, his brother, from t being chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster; the lord Finch, son to the earl of Nottingham, from being one of the lords of the treasury; and the lord Guernsey, his cousin german; from being master of the jewel office. This change, however sudden, was not unforeseen by men of observation; and it justified Mr. Hampden's reflection, not many days before, in the mixed House of Commons, on a motley or ministry.

44 Pursuant to the resolution taken in the council, orders were dispatched for. executing

the next morning the earls of Derwentwater and Nithisdale ', and the lord Kenmure; and for respiting the lord Widdrington, the earl of Carnwath, and the lord Nairn, till the 7th of March. The same evening the earl of Nithis-dale found means to make his escape out of the Tower, iu a woman’s apparel brought to him by his mother, who came to visit with some relations. The next morning early, three detachments of the guards took their several posts round the scaffold erected on Tower Hill, and, a little before ten o'clock, the earl of Derwentwater and the lord Kenmure were carried in a hackney coach from the Tower to the Transport*Office, on Tower Hill, where, there was a room hung with black for their reception. From this room to the scaffold (which was all covered with black) there was a passage or gallery railed in. The earl of Derwentwater was first led to the scaffold; and it was observed, that in his going thither, and ascending the steps, his countenance turned very pale. But, after he had been a few minutes on the scaffold, his behaviour appeared resolute and sedate. Having spent some time in prayer with a book, he then addressed himself to the sheriff, and desired, he might have liberty to read a paper which he had drawn up. This request being readily granted, he went to the rails of the scaffold and read what follows.

‘Being in a few minutes to appear before the tribunal of God, where, though most unworthy, I hope to find mercy, which I have not found from men now in power; I have endea- voured to make my peace with his divine raajes- ty, by most humbly begging pardon for’all the sins of my life:and I doubt not of a merciful forgiveness through the merits of the passion and death of my Sav.iour Jesus Christ; for which end I earnestly desire the prayers of all good christians. After this I am to ask pardon of those, whom I might have scandalized by pleading Guilty at my trial. Such, as were- permitted to come to me, told me, that, bav- ing been undeniably in arms, pleading Guilty was but the consequence of having submitted to mercy; and many arguments were used to prove there was nothing of moment in so doing; among others, the universal practice of signing leases, whereof the preambles run in the name of the person in possession. But 4 I am sensible, that in this I have made bold with loyalty, having never any other but king.

4 James the 3d for my rightful And lawful sovereign. Him I had an inclination to serve f from my infancy, and was moved thereto by 4 a natural love I had to his person, knowing him to be capable of making his people happy. And, though be had been of a different '

4 religion from mine, 'I should have done-for him all that lay in my power, as my ancestors have done for his predecessors, being thereunto bound by the laws of God and man.. 4 Wherefore, if in this affair I have acted rashly it oupbt not to affect the innocent* I intena- ed to wrong nobody, but to serve my king and country, and that without self interest; hoping,

285] PAUL. HISTORY, 2 George I* 1716. — The impeached Lords . [256

* by the example I gave, to have induced others «to their duty; and God, who sees the secrets of r my heart, knows I speak truth. Some means

* have been proposed to me for saving my life,

* which I looked upon as inconsistent with honour and conscience, and therefore I rejected them; for with God’s assistance, I

* shall prefer any death to the doing a base un-

* worthy action. I only wish now, that the lay-• ing aown my life might contribute to the ser-

* vice of my king and country, and the re-esta-

* blishmer^ of the antient and fundamental

* constitution of these kingdoms; without which

* no lasting peace or true happiness can attend

* them. -Then I should indeed part with my

“ After the reading of this paper, he delivered it to the sheriff, telling him, he might do'with it as he pleased; and that be had given a copy of.it to a friend. Then turning to the block, he viewed it close, and finding in it a rough place, that might offend his neck, he bid the executioner cut ft off; which uncommon presence of mind was observed with admiration by some of the standers by. Having prepared himself for the blow, by taking off his coat and waistcoat, ha lay down to fit his head to the block, telling the executioner, that the sign he should give him was, Lord Jesus receive my soul and, at the third time repeating it, he was to do his office; which he did at one blow. It was reported, that the night before, the earl of Derwentwater having sent for Mr. Stephen Roome, an undertaker for funerals, and discoursing with him about his own, he told him, he would have a silver plate on his coffin, with an inscription importing, That he died a sacrifice for his lawful sovereignbut, Mr. Roome scrupling to comply with it, he wasdismissed. This was the reason, no hearse was provided for him at his execution; so.that his head was only taken up by one of his servants and put into a clean handkerchief, and, the bedy being wrapped up in black cloth, they were both together carried to the Tower.

“ Soon after the lord Kenmure was brought to the scaffold in the same manner, accompanied by his son, and some friends, and attended by two- clergymen of the church of England.

He shewed a great resolution and firmness in his gait and countenance, though someniceoh-servers pretended he was not so* calm within as the earl of Derwentwater; which however was contradicted by others. On the scaffold he said, ‘ he had so little thoughts of dying so (soqp, that he had not provided a black suit,

* that he might have died with the more decency; for which he was sorry.’ He appeared very sincere and fervent in his devotions, often lifting up his.hands and eyes to heaven; but (contrary to what he had declared in his speech to the lords, when judgment was pronounced against him) he prayed for the Pretender, and repented of his having pleaded guilty. He embraced and kissed very tenderly most of the officers and gentlemen on the scaffold, and his son and some friends twice or thrice. He bad with him Mr. Roome the undertaker, who was to take care of his body, and a surgeon, who > was to direct the executioner in doing his office. Having prepared for the block, he laid down his head upon it, then raised it up again, still continuing on his knees; gave the executioner some money, and told him, He should give

* him no-sign, but, when he laid his head down

* again'lie might do his work as he saw good.’ . Then, having lifted up his hands in prayer a short time longer, he laid down his head again, 1 which the executioner severed at two blows. Both the head and body were put into a coffin, and conveyed in a hearse to Mr. Roome's, where they were embalmed, in order to be sent into Scotland, and buried with his ancestors. He neither made nor delivered any speech on the scaffold; but iu a letter found after his execution, which he wrote to the Preteuder (by the stile of king James,) he declared, Tfi, at

‘ he died for his faithful services to his majesty,

* but hoped, the cause he died for would thrive

* and flourish after his death; and as he su£>

* fered for his service, he hoped his' majesty ‘ would provide for his wife and children, who

* were in a miserable condition. ’

“ On the 15th of March, the earl of Win-toun’s trial came on.* The long trouble and delay, he had occasioned by petitions for time, upon the pretence of witnesses being' on the road, made people expect, that a considerable defence could be made, and something, very particular be urged in his behalf, either by himself or his council; but they were surprized, that when he came to the bar, and the managers of the House of Commons had spent two days in opening and inforcing the Articles against him, and replying to what was offered, his answers wete so weak, and what his council bad to offer so trifling, that it could not be called a defence. This gave some confirmation to what bad been suggested, that be was a . lunatic. However the lords were unanimous in their judgment, and bronght him in Guilty; and, on the 19th of M&rch, judgment was pro-

' Debate concerning the Land Tax Bill.] February 1. The Lords having read a second time the Land Tax Bill, and referred it to a committee of the whole House; some iPeers were offended at the Preamble: And the earl of Abingdon thefeupoo moved. That all the Peers in town might be summoned to attend that committee, which was done accordingly. The said Preamble was as follows:u We your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great Britain m parliament assembled, having hearts filled with the utmost gratitude to your majesty, for the tender concern your majesty on all occasions, expresses for the extraordinary burthen this unnatural rebellion makes necessary to be laid on your faithful subjects, for preserving ail their rights, both sacred and civil; and for your majesty's unprecedented goodness, in giving up all such estates for the use of the public, and in ease of your people, ’ as shall be forfeited by this rebellion; the raising, or the dreadful consequences /whereof cannot, by the most implacable of your majesty's enemies, be ascribed to any one act done by your majesty, since your happy accession to the throne of your ancestors; but even they will allow, that all the mischiefs, burthens, and calamities which shall attend this horrid rebellion, are, in truth, owing to the fatal and pernicious councils given by some persons in the late male-administration, when, under pretence of procuring peace abroad, the present destructive war was projected to be brought into the very bowels of our native country at home, when a popish army, (part of which "God has delivered into your hands) was designed to be the protecter of our holy religion; and when under the false colour of paying the public debts, though their true design was to deliver us bound into the power of the ancient enemy of these kingdoms; the same evil counsellors contrived uunecessarily to incumber, for a long time to come, (if not for ever) several considerable branches of the public revenues, which, for many years past, had, from time to time, been useful to support the public expence; which revenues in former administrations, had been carefully reserved for that purpose to the end, that upon the conclusion of an happy peace, which we had then reason to expect, the subjects of these realms might have reaped the fruits of 9 successful, though expensive war. And we your majesty’s said dutiful and loyal subjects being fully resolved to maintain your % majesty's just title to the imperial crown of tHese realms, against all enemies and traitors whatsoever; and for that end purpose to raise such supplies as are necessary to defray your majesty's public expences, have cheerfully and unanimously given and granted, &c.”

A Committee appointed to faftri the

Bight of the Lord* to alter

February 13. The lord Harcourt went early to the House of Peers, and caused the Journals to be searched for precedents of Amendments, made by the Lords to a Money-Bill: But few, if any could be found, at least siuce the Restoration in 1660, from which time the Commons would never suffer the Lords tp..make alterations in bills of that nature. When the grand Committee was sat, several lords spoke against the preamble in question, as prejudging matters of a very high and important nature, the cogftizance and determination of which properly belonged to the House of Peers.- The courtiers were sensible that this objection was well grounded; but being unwilling, on the other hand, to put a stop to the bill at this critical juncture, an expedient was proposed, and admitted, viz. That they should enter ia their Journal a kind of Protest or a Declaration, importing in substance, That, although the Preamble to the said bill contains several assertions of facts different from the matter of the said bill, and which may possibly hereafter fall under the consideration of this House in their judicial capacity; yet nevertheless their lordships, being extremely Sensible of the very great and public inconvenience which would ensue, if the necessary supply of money, for which the said bill provides, should he delayed, have therefore, out of zeal for his majesty’s service and the public good thought fit to .instruct, and do hereby order, That it be an instruction to the Committee of the whole House, to agree to the said preamble, without any amendment.” '

And then the following Declaration was agreed to by the House: *

“ But, to preveot any ill consequences from such a precedent for the future, they have thought fit to declare solemnly, and to enter upon their books for a record to all posterity. That they will not hereafter admit, upon any occasion whatsoever, of a proceeding so contrary to the rules and methods of parliament \ aAd as to the said assertions in the preamble to the said bill, their lordships do further declare, That they will not in any manner bold themselves fconcluded by any of the said assertions, in any judicial proceeding or debate whatsoever; and are of opinion, that no Argument drawn from any such assertion only, without due proof, ought to be of any force or validity upon any occasion before-mentioned.”

Ordered. That such Lords as think fit may -sign the said Declaration in the Journal at any time during this session of parliament.

The King'a Speech relating to the Pretender’s Flight out of Scotland.] Feb. 17." The king went to the House of Peers, and gave the royal assent to such bills as were ready* After which, the Lord Chancellor, by his jesty's command* read the following Speech to both Houses:

“ My Lords atod Gentlemen,

that my forces have obliged the Pretender to fly out of Scotland; and he is since, as I am informed, landed near Gravelines, but I don't yet know, whether any country in amity with us, will give him protection, after having so z publicly invaded our kingdom.

u The dangers to which the nation w«9 exposed, made me determine, that neither the extraordinary rigour of the season, nor 'any fallacious proposal of the rebels, should divert me from using all possible endeavours towards putting a speedy and effectual end to .this unnatural rebellion.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons,

“ I must return you my thanks for the great progress you have made in the supplies. The necessary dispositions are made for raising additional forces: But as I' shall always consult the ease of my people, as far as it is consistent with their own security, so I shall not make use of the confidence you have placed in me, unless the restless malice of our enemies should make it necessary to go on with those levies. u My Lords and Gentlemen,

“ I promise myself, from the zeal and wisdom of this parliament, that the future happiness and tranquillity of my subjects, will be established on a solid foundation; and such measures taken, as may deprive our enemies at _ home of the power, since that alone can deprive them of the inclination, again to attempt the disturbance of my government. This, therefore, is what I think myself obliged to recommend to you as a deliberation of the utmost importance to the future safety, ease, and prosperity of my people." ,

The Lords' Address thereon."] Feb. 90. The

Lords waited on the King with the following Address:

“ Most Gracious Sovereign;

. “ We, your majesty’s most dutiful and|oyal subjects, the Lord$ spiritual and temporal, ip parliament assembled, beg leave to return your majesty the thanks of this House, for your roost ' gracious speech from the throne; and to congratulate your majesty upon the success your forces have'had, in obliging the-Pretender to fly out of Scotland: And, as wo do not doubt but your majesty will use the most effectual means towards preventing the said Pretender’s finding refuge or protection in any country in amity with your majesty; so we do assure your majesty of our utmost support and assistance, in shewing your just resentment against any prince or state that shall give him protection. And we take this opportunity tov express the true sense this House has of your majesty’s great wisdom and care of your people, in havr ang resolved, not only to put a speedy, but an effectual, end to this Rebellion, without having hearkened to any fallacious proposals of the Rebels, which could only have tended to leave the seeds of future rebellions and distractions an this kingdom: And we do farther humbly thank your majesty for your gracious intentions to ease your people of any ourtheo, as far as

is consistent with the public safety; not doubting but, if yolir majesty judges it necessary, you will make use of the power already granted you. And we do humbly assure your majesty, that nothing shall be wanting on our pait, towards securing, upon the most solid and lasting foundations, your majesty’s government, upon which the future happiness and tranquillity of these kingdoms does entirely depend."

The King's Answer.] The King returned this Answer:

“ My Lords,

“ I thank you heartily for this dutiful and loyal Address: I will immediately order the most pressing instances to be made to all princes and states in amity with me, in relation to the Pretender; and shall, in evefy thing, always consult the security and happiness of my people."

The Commons' Address.] The Comment* Address was as follows:

“ Most Gracious Sovereign;

* We your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great Britain in par* liament assembled, do, with hearts full of gratitude, return your majesty our unfeigned thanks for your most gracious speech from the throne; and do beg leave most neartily to congratulate with your majesty upon the success with which it has pleased Almighty God so far tp bless your arms, as to force the Pretender ont of your majesty's dominions.

u We are willing to hope, that no prince or state in amity -with your majesty will give refuge, countenance, or protection, to a person . who, in so notorious a manner, has disturbed the peace of your kingdoms: But the dangers to which your majesty's sacred person, and government, the religion, laws, and liberties of our country, have seen once exposed, by this vile attempt, would leave your Commons without excuse to those they represent, if they should see, with patience, the nation, exposed to the like hazard for the future, by the Pretender to your majesty's crown being sheltered in your neighbourhood:We do therefore make it our humble request to your majesty. That you will use the. most earnest and pressing instances with all princes jaud states in amity with your majesty, That he may not be harboured in their territories: And we beg leave to give your majesty the strongest assurances, That we will, to the utmost of our power, contribute whatever shn'l, by your majesty, be judged necessary to render those instances effectual.

“ The tender regard whith your majesty expresses'for the ease of your people, in declining to put the nation to any farther expence, at present, for additional forces, does, if possible, heighten that confidence which we so justly had reposed hi you:But we beseech your majesty, that, in settling the proportion of forces to bf. maintained this year by sea and land, your ma* jesty will have such a regard to the disposition ana preparations of our neighbours, from time to time, as to provide effectually for the security

291 ] PARL. HISTORY, 2 r&s T.

of your kingdoms against any power that shall presume to countenance or abet the Pretender.

« Your Commons cannoT'sufficiently express the just sense they have of your majesty's consummate wisdom, and firm resolution, not to be diverted or amused by any difficulties of the season, or any specious artifices, from pursuing the Rebels in Scotland to their several retreats; since that method alone could restore, and secure with honour, peace and tranquillity to that part of your dominions.

“ It is with the utmost concern we observe, that tire malice and inveteracy of our enemies at home is so great, that they want not the inclination to disturb your majesty's government; but ypur faithful Commons, in duty to your majesty, and love for their country, will endeavour to deprive them of the power, by taking such prudent and necessary measures, as may most effectually secure the future safety, ease, and prosperity, of your people.” '

The Kiiig's Answer.] To which his majesty returned this Answer:

“ Gentlemen;

“ I thank you for this dutiful and affectionate Address: I will endeavour, by all proper

paeans, to prevent the Pretender's being suffered to give perpetual jealousies, by continuing in our neighbourhood; and will, if the advices I shall receive from abroad do render it necessary, not lose any time in making such an augmentation of forces, by sea and land, as may,

' with the blessing of God, effectually answer youv wishes to see the nation secured from any foreign or intestine attempt whatsoever.”

The Commons adjourn to prevent any appti-eation to them in favour of the impeached Lords.] February 22. Several Petitions* were delivered to the House of Commons in behalf of the earl of Derwentwater, lord Widdrington, earl Of Nithisdale, earl of Carnwath, lord viscount

._______ — i

* “ With a view to prevent the House being troubled with any further Petitions, which it was determined to reject, Walpole himself proposed an adjournment to the 1st of March, as it was known that their execution was to take place before that time: the motion met with so strong an opposition, that it was carried only a majority of seven voices. But Walpole proved his indignation to originate in virtuous and disinterested motives, when he stated to the House, that he had been offered 60,000l. to save tbeTife of one single person (the earl of Derwentwater). He also spoke, as one of the managers for the Commons, in the prosecution of the earl of Wiutown, another of the rebel lords; and he seems in every instance to have urged the necessity of adopting severe measures in the present alarming crisis; a mode of conduct so opposite to the natural bias of his temper, which always leaned to* the side of humanity, as proved his full conviction, that too much lenity shewn to persons taken in flagrant rebellion, would at this period have proved dangerous to the state.” Cexe's Walpole.

* t(The rebellion was now quelled, and the strength of the rebels intirely'broken, but the disaffection of the people was not yet conquered. The parliament was (lie bulwark of the crown; the vigour and unanimity of the king's friends, and their superiority in the House, was the support of the Whole affair. But the parliament being only of three years continuance, by virtue of the Triennial Act, made in the 6th year of king William and queen Mary; all the hopes of the other party seemed to be centered in this, that the parliament would expire; and that they should hie able, by their influence in the country, to chnse a majority of their party at the next election; or raise such a ferment at that juncture, as might make way for a successful invasion from abroad. This the'persons at the helm observed with concern; and therefore resolved to bafflte these hopes of the enemies of the government, by prolonging the sitting of the present parliament. It is said, it was first proposed only to suspend the triennial act for once, whereby this parliament would have continued three years beyond the time, at which it was to determine; hut it was afterwards thought, that a bill for inlarging the time of continuance of parliaments in general, would be less liable to exceptions. The next thing that fell under consideration was, whether this intended bill should be set on foot in the House of Lords, oi* in the House of Commons ? The first tvab judged the properer for several rbasofis, parti-

Lords, representing the inconveniences that attend the triennial elections of members of par-lament; particularly, that they''serve only to beep up party divisions, and to raise and foment ieuds and animosities in private families; That

cularly, because the court being more sure of a •majority in the House of Commons, if the bill miscarried with the Lords, the odium of this .project, which carried a face of unpopularity, would uot rest upon the Commons, nor consequently prejudice future elections.” Tindal.

“ Though the rebellion was extinguished, the flame of national disaffection still continued to rage; The severities exercised against the re-’ bels increased the general discontent: For now the danger was blown over their humane passions began to prevail. The courage and fortitude with which the condemned persons encountered the pains of death in its most dreadr ful form, prepossessed many spectators in favour of the cause by which those unhappy victims -were animated. In a word, persecution, as usual, extended the heresy. The ministry, perceiving this universal dissatisfaction, and dreading the revolution of a new parliament, which might wrest the power from their faction, and retort upon them the violence of their own measures, formed a resolution equally odious and effectual to establish their administration. This was no oilier than a scheme to repeal the Triennial Act, and by a new lajv to extend the term of parliaments to seven, years.” Smollett.

“ The ministry perceiving, and probably resenting t^c general discontent and disaffection of the people to a government, which willingly concealed even from itself the desire of vengeance by which it was actuated, under the veil of loyalty and patriotism, now found or imagined the necessity of adopting a measure for the preservation of the public safety, which has been ever considered as the highest and most unconstitutional exertion of parliamentary authority attempted since the acm of the revolution; and, if wp except the act of Henry 8, declaring the proclamations of the crown equal in validity to, actspf parliament, and the perpetuity act of Charles 1, it may not be too much to affirm, since the first existence of parliaments. This was no other than th$ introduction of the famous Septennial Bill, in the session of 171C, by which the parliament not only assumed a power of prolonging the duration of futji re parliaments, but even its own; and being elected by the nation for three years, they elected themselves for four years more.” Bels bam.

“ Dpring this juteryel, theSeptennial Bill was .brought into parliament, ^though Walpole was -not able to support this measure in the House JofiCop»mons, yet, as it had been previously ar-jcaugpd with his concurrence, and as he also constantly opposed the repeal, it has always .heen j.ustjy considered an act of his administrate p.

besides, they occasion ruinous expences, and give a handle to the cabals and intrigues of foreign princes: That therefore it was becoming of the wisdom of that august assembly, to apply a proper remedy to an evil which might be attended with the most dangerous consequences,

ligious liberties, because it effectually supported the House of Brunswick on the throne; was undoubtedly one of the most daring uses, or, according to the representations of its opponents, abuses of parliamentary power that ever was committed since the revolution; for, ' it not only lengthened the duration of future parliaments, but the members who had been elected only for three years, prolonged, of their own authority, the term of their continuance for four years more. The great body of the Whigs, influenced by these considerations, were, at the first proposition, htverse to the measure, and did not agree to support it, till mature deliberation had convinced them of its necessity. During the debates which took place on this occasion, the arguments of opposition and defence, were not unequal to the importance and dignity of the subject. We, whp live at this distance, of time, without being heated by the warmth of party, without sufficiently considering the temper and state of the nation, and without weighing the peculiar circumstances which occasioned its introduction, must confess, that in theory, the arguments of those who opposed it, are the most specious and convincing; but if we recur to the events of the times, and the state of the country, we must applaud the wisdom of those who sacrificed speculation to practice: That the necessity must have been great and evident, appears from the consideration, that it was supported by men of the first rank, independence, and probity in the kingdom; that jp the House of Lords, where it was proposed by the duke of Devonshire, there were only 38 voices against it, and that, on being sent to the House of Commons, there was a majority of 284 against 121. But whatever opinion might be formed of the justice of the right exercised by parliament, in repealing the triennial act and substituting septennial parliaments, yet it can scarcely be coutested, that it has in effect been highly advantageous to the well-being of the legislature, and to the real interest of the nation. The Speaker Onslow, who was no ill judge of parliamentary proceedings, was frequently heard to declare, that the passing of the Septennial Bill formed the era of the emancipation of the British House of Commons from its former dependence on the crown and the House of Lords. From that period it has risen in consequence and strength.” Coxe’s Walpole.

“ This has been thought by many an unconstitutional exertion of their authority; and the reason given is, that those who had a power delegated to them for three years only, could have no right to extend that term to' seven years. But this bqs always appeared to me to

especially in the present temper of the nation, 'for though the rebellion was happily suppressed, yet the spirit of it remained unoonquered, -and seemed only to wait for an opportunity to shew itself with more violence:that the election of a new parliament, which by the triennial act was not far off, being the most favourable juncture which the disaffected could expect, he thought it absolutely necessary to deprive them of it: For which purpose, he had a Bill* to offer to the House, for enlarging the continuance of parliaments; and at the same time he moved it might be read.

He was seconded by the earl of Rockingham, and backed by the duke of Argyle, the earl of Dorset, and lord Townshend.

The duke of Buckingham, the lord Trevor, the’earls of Nottingham and Aylesford, and several other Peers, though they did not directly oppose the bill, yet were for putting off the reading of it to another time:they did not deny, but that every member of that House had the privilege of offering what bill he thought fit; nut that the House was likewise at liberty

be a fallacious mode of considering the subject. Before the triennial act, 6 W. and M. the duration of parliament was only limited by the pleasure or death of the king: and it never can be supposed that the next, or any succeeding parliament, had not the power of repealing the triennial act; and if that had been done, then, as before, they might have sat seventeen or seventy years. It is certainly true, that the simple repeal of a former statute would have extended their continuance much beyond what was done by the Septennial act." Blackstone’s Commentaries, vol. 2. p. 189, Christian's edition.

* After reciting the act, 6th William and Mary, for making parliaments Triennial, the preamble of the bill goes on thus, “ And whereas, k hath been found by experience, that the said clause hath proved very grievous and burthensome, by occasioning much greater and more continued expences, in order to elections of members to serve in parliament, and more violent and lasting heats and animosities among the subjects of this realm, than were ever known, before the said clause was enacted; and the said provision, if it should continue, may probably at this juncture, when a restless ana Popish faction are designing and endeavouring to renew the rebellion within this kingdom, and an invasion from abroad, be destructive to the peace and security of the government: Be it enacted, that this present parliament, and all parliaments that shall at any time hereafter be called, assembled or held, shall and may respectively have continuance for----years,

and no longer, to be accounted from the day^on which, by the writ of summons, this present parliament bath been, or any future parliaments shall be appointed to meet, unlesk this present, or any such parliament hereafter, to be summoned, shall be sooner dissolved by his majesty, his heirs or successors."

either to read it or not, as they thought convenient; and that the matter proposed, was of so high a nature, that it well deserved to be maturely weighed and considered, before there were any debates upon it; and therefore they moved that the Bill might lie some days upon the table, before the first reading.

The lords who were for reading it presently answered them, That it was far from their thoughts to offer at the carrying any thing by surprise: that by the ordinary method of proceeding, every member had a sufficient'time to weigh and consider what was offered to the House. Then the earl of Dorset proposed. That after the Bill had been once read, the second reading should be put off to the Saturday following; to which the House agreed.* April 14. This Bill being, according to order, ’ read a second time, the lord Cowper put the

Question, Whether it should be committed? Jpon which, there arose a warm debate.

The Earl of Abingdon who spoke first against the Bill, said “ That it was of a very extraordinary nature, since it repealed the Triennial Act, which the people justly ldok^d upon as the great security of their rights imd liberties j and that if it passed this House, and the Commons agreed to it, it would, on their part, be a breach of that trust which was reposed in them by those whom they represented."

The latter part of this assertion was denied by

The Duke of Kingston, who urged “ That the

business of the legislature was to rectify old laws, as well as to make new ones."

The Earl Poulet spoke next against the Bill, and declared, “ That be would have been for it, if he thought it for the king's service and interest; but that before they went any further in so important an affair, some method should be used to know the sentiments of the nation. His lordship urged, That this Bill shewed a distrust of the affections of the people, without which, no king can be either safe or easy:that king William gained the hearts of his subjects by theTrieunial Act; and it would look somewhat strange, that the most popular of our laws should be repealed a year after the Protestant Succession took place. After this, he endeavoured to answer what was suggested in support of this bill, viz. 1st, That frequent elections occasion ruinous -expences; 2dly, That they raise a great ferment, and foment animosities which are of the most dangerous consequence, after the late rebellion; and Sdly, that they obstruct foreign alliances. He said, That no stress ought to be laid on the first of those

objections, expences at elections being voluntary:that as .to the second, he was sorry there bad-been a rebellion, but'that now it was happily suppressed: and as to the third suggestion, That that was of no weight with him, it being his opinion, that in a matter which so nearly concerns our constitution, we ought to have regard to ourselves only, and not to foreigners; upon all which considerations, he was against the committing of this Bill."

The Earl of Dorset said, “ That they who now spoke against this Bill, would be for it, if it served their turn: that the Triennial Act was a new law, and an alteration of the old constitution:that the experience of twenty years having shewn a thousand inconveniencies that attend that law, they ought to apply a remedy to it: that the said law sowed the Seeds of corruption, it being notorious, that great numbers of persons bad no other livelihood, J than by being employed in bribing corporations: that we had lately made a sad experience of it, since, by those methods, a parliament was procured by the last ministry, which gave sanction to most of their ill measures, and weut near to give up the trade and liberties of the nation: that Triennial elections destroy all family interest, and subject our excellent constitution to the caprice of the multitude; and, in short, that by Triennial elections, we have but a Triennial government, which is little better than no government, at all: for which reasons be was for this bill ”

The Lord Trevor declared, “ That he had ho manner of prejudice to those who brought in the bill: that; on the contrary, he had all the honour and respect for that noble peer who offered it to the House; being satisfied, that he thought it to he for the interest of his king and country: that as for his own part, all he aimed at, was the preservation of our excellent constitution, and that the crown might sit easy on the king's head, and be for ever secured to his royal family, for whom he professed the sincerest affection: that the question now lying, before them was, whether- the law they were going to make, tended to the good or prejudice of the constitution ? That he himself looked upon the Triennial Act as an essential part of our ancient constitution, according to which, frequent and even annual parliaments were to be held:that he could easily prove, that long parliaments were always pernicious: that when king Charles 1, had given up his prerogative of dissolving parliaments, in 1640, he gave himself up into the hands of traitors, and had nothing but destruction to expect from them: that after the Restoration, king Charles 2 found the inconveniences of a long, parliament: that as soon 6s the nation had opportunity, by the Revolution, to assert their just rjghts and liberties, the Triennial Act was insisted on, and gained, at last, with a great deal of opposition:that there were very

food and cogent reasons for making this law, viz. o support the constitution; to prevent encroach-

1716. — in the House of . [898

raents, either of parliaments on the crowd, or of the crown on the rights and liberties of the people; and to correct abuses and exorbitances committed through the ambition and avarice of ministers: that he would not be thought to reflect on the present administration; but that in his opinion, frequent elections were a necessary right Of the subject to remedy abuses: that, for his j»wn part, he had ever been against the bill for limiting the number of officers in the House of Commons; but if the Triennial Act were repealed, he thought that bill would become very necessary, because the long sitting of parliaments would give the crown both an opportunity and temptation to multiply the number of officers: that soqne reflections had been cast on the last parliament; but that, in his opinion, that parliament was. chosen by the same method as the present was, viz. by great expences; that he owned this to be a great abuse; but that laws might be made to.rectify the same: that if this bill passed, how could any member of the other House expect to preserve his interest with those who chose him, whep this bill would certainly be interpreted both a violation of their right, and a breach of the trust reposed in him? That if this House of Commons continued themselves beyond the time for which they were chosen, they were no more the representatives of the people, but a House of their own making: that he was sorry there were discontents in the country; but that be apprehended, this Bill would rather increase than abate them. .He owned, that the majb-rity of this House of Commons were honest gentlemen, who had the interest of their king and country at heart; but that, in his opinion, those who went before them, did not come short of them in point of duty and affection to his majesty; for it was they who established the king on his throne, and settled his revenue with all the cheerfulness imaginable. Concluding, that what he had suggested flowed from the dread of the ill consequences of this Bill, which might rise to such a height, as to render the crown uneasy to his majesty; and that he owed so much to the protestant succession, that if he could believe this bill, to be of any service to the king and his royal family, he would be entirely for it; but that'as he was of a quite contrary opinion; he would not have a bill, obtained in the best of reigns, repealed in the first year of this protestant reign; and therefore he should give his opinion against committing it.

The Lord Carteret spoke next, and owned, “ That frequent parliaments are a great security to the people’s rights and liberties; but then he observed, that this bill was not against frequent sessions, but only against frequent elections; that they ought maturely to weigh and consider what was suggested in the preamble to this bill, viz. That there is a restless popish faction designing and endeavouring to renew the rebellion within this kingdom. To this purpose his lordship

observed. That of ad rebellions (his lost was the most monstrous and unnatural; for ail other rebellions were carried on under pretences of liberty, whereas this last was a rebellion for slavery; .that ns to her allies abroad, though he could not say, that they expected this bill, yet it was reasonable to suppose that fhey would be glad to see it pass into a law; for having found, by sad experience, that great changes may be made in the best concerted measures, by different parliaments, influenced h7 different ministries; so if they had not some ^security for the treaties his majesty was now entering into with them, a strong tide might come, upon a new election, that might overturn all: that, in short, this bill would fijf the king, and the present happy settle* ment, on a lasting foundation; and therefore be was for committing it/ '

' The Duke of Buckingham stood up, and declared, “ That he would not be against this ' Bill, if be thought it for the king's interest and service; but that he was afraid the crowu would be the worse for it: that the Triennial Act, might, indeed be subject to some inconveniences; but that the best things are not exempt from them; that means should be found out and pursued, to remedy those inconveniencies, but instead of that, they now were going to repeal a good law, and alter the constitution, Pray, my Lords, ’ said his Grace, consider what you are doing i Why, to pre-‘ vent robbing on the high-way, you forbid travelling/ If a man breaks his leg, shall a surgeon tell him he must be fluxed, and alter his constitution ? He ow^ed. That there was a great ferment in the nation, and he was very sorry for it: but that he thought this Bill a very improper remedy for it. And he remembered it bad beep said in their House, FTbat it would never be well in England, tity | there were annual parliaments; that king ? William, whoWas a wise prince, made .himself i and his people easy by the Triennial act: and be was afraid the bill now in question, would bare a quite contrary effect; and therefore, be was against it at this time, whatever he might be at another juncture: that, in his opinion the late rebellion was not a sufficient reason for repealing the Triennial act; that the rebels were rash, inconsiderate men, who either had, or were to pay dear for their rashness and folly; but that both they pod their friends were inconsiderable; that they, perhaps, might whisper discontent «nd treason in corners; but that, he hoped, it was not, nor ever would be «their power to do haun t" So . that upon the whole matter, he was against the Bill.

* The Earl of Cholmondeley said, “ That he did put design to .cqmpliment any one in power, either now or in time to come, but .that he would My speak his sentiments, according to the dictates xff his reason and jmnscieuce: that he made m doubt, but tfcat the legislature is wstnd pwith a power to rectify any in *

conveniences to which any former law may, by ^experience, be found to be subject; and this being the case of the Triennial Act, they ought to remedy the same: that what had been suggested in relation to.the long parliament in king Charles the lid’s reign, wgs, in his opinion, rather an argument for, than against this bill; for though, in that parliament, the king ha<j many pensioners, who, at first, complimented him with money, yet, at last, when tjie interest of the nation came to be at stake, they voted for a war with France, and prosecuted the Popish Plot with the utmost vigour: that they had lately seen what a corrupt Parliament may do, and by what means sudia Parliament may begot: and every one might guess how there came to be a debt of 500,000l. upon the civil list: that he did not mention this to irritate against persons, but against things: that, in hi* opinion, there was no better remedy against corruption, than the suppressing frequent elections; which, on the other band, occasion lasting feuds and animosities in families: that he thougfc this bill the more necessary, because our allies wilt thereby have a security, that they shall not again be left in the lurch: and, that in consideration of the great benefits that will accrue from it, both at home and abroad, h* was for committing it."

He was answered by

Lord Ferrers, who principally enlarged on the excellency of cur constitution; he took notice, that the different branches of the legislature are a cheek to one another, which prevents exorbitance in the administration, and dragooning, as in Turkey, and other arbitrary governments; and suggested, that the pensionary parliament made king Charles 2 uneasy, by making him neglect the affections of his people; and concluded, he wa3 afraid that the repealing' the Triennial Act would have the same effect; and therefore he was against it.

To this

The Duke of Newcastle answered, that it had already been rightly observed, that though the long parliament of king Qharles 2 at first com- plimented that prince, yet they afterward* vigorously opposed destructive measures, and insisted on a war with France. Then passing over less material objections, he urged, that the present happy settlement could not be maintained, without taking away the seeds of corruption:that- m cause ever miscarried in .so many instances ns that of the rebels; but tbajc notwithstanding their defeat at Preston and Dc mb lain; their being driven out of Scotland, with their king at their head; their disap* poiotmeots in other parts; and the execution of some of their leaders; the Jacobites wet* a» insolent as ewer:that this was the reason why, in a late debate in this House, he was against -lenity; and the rather, because no . prince wq* ever more naturally inclined to mercy, than his present majesty; for no prince ever had Ad many rebels in his power, and, never were so few punished, My buds* said he« jpn sow

strengthen yourselves, and disarm your enemies. It is not to be doubted, but the late unnatural end monstrous rebellion Was raised and fomented by large contributions of a restless Popish faction:the same means, my lords, n il! be used to renew the rebellion, as soon as a proper opportunity offers. Their emissaries are busy every where to keep up the spirits of the people for a year longer, and then they hope to retrieve all by a new election. lie concluded, that though the allies would not make any thing, done among us an article of their treaties, yeth .ving the 9ad experience of being left in the lurch^ they would certainly enter into alliances with us with more confidence, if they saw that our government was not precarious: upon all which considerations, he declared himself in favour of the bill.

The Earl of Aylesford standing up next, pro-

fessed, in the first place, that he did not entertain the least prejudice against this bill on account of those who brought it in; for when matters of so great impottance catne under deliberation, he bad no manner of regard to any denomination of parties; that he had so great an affection for his majesty, that if he thought it to be anywise for his majesty's service, he would readily be for it; but that, in his opinion, this bill was not for the service either of the king or country, whose interests he looked upon as inseparable. He urged, among other things, that it was objected against the Triennial Act, that frequent elections occasion ruinous expences, and create feUds and animosities: but that these objections were not of sufficient weight with him, to induce him to give his vote for repealing so good a law; that it could not be denied, that a great deal of money is expended in elections, but the candidates may chuse whether they will spend any or no; that it may likewise be granted, that those expences lay the foundation of corruption, and that those who make them, are in hopes to get either places or pensions; but that, by the Triennial Act, the country has an opportunity to remedy any abuses that may be committed by any of their representatives, who, to make good their expences at elections, should yield to the temptation of a place or pension, to sacrifice their votes in parliament; whereas, on the contrary, this bill will establish a grievance and take away a remedy; that as the Triennial Act gained the affections of the people, it was to be feared chat the repealing of it would have a contrary effect: that what had been suggested about foreign allies, Was, in his opinion, no proper argument for this bill, Our constitution, which ought to be altogether independent on foreigners, being solely to be considered in this debate: as to what had been alledged concerning the disaffection of many of his majesty's subjects; he said, he was sorry to hear the last parliament unjustly reflected upon, since no House of Commons could be more fovwafd than they, in shewing their affection to his majesty; and they not only readily settled his revenue, but enacted a1 reward of i00,000i.

9

for the apprehending of the Pretender to his' crown; that when his majesty came to take possession of his thrdne, he was received with the general acclamations of the people: that he woald not pretend to enter into the reasons of the present disaffection, but yet he would venture to say, that it had been easy for the king, upon coming over, to have united the whole kingdom; that he wished there had been no mistake in those who would appear 4to be the king's best friends. Be that as it would, it was his opinion that this bill would not procure that good agreement be-’ tween king and country* which they who brought it in seemed to have in view; but, div the contrary, might end in the destruction of those who advised it, and prove mischievous both to the king and his people, as tending to create disunion between them: that he hoped die ferment was not so great m it was reprew seated; and besides, no man could say* that two years hence the people wetrid be in th£ same ilk humour, as they were said to be at present: upon all which reason he was against this bill.

This speech was answered by

The Earl of Iluy, who begged leave to offer some few thoughts of his own upon the important matter that was under consideration » then pursuing the chief reasons on which this' bill was grounded, he urged, among other things, thatjt is certain frequent elections ocea-1 sion ruinous expences; and it is nef less true, that rainous expences beget, of course, corruption; for when gentlemen have laid out their estates in elections, they must exert their industry to find out some means to make themselves amends: that besides'this evil, frequent elections are a great occasion of Vice, debauchery, and decay of trade; that notwithstanding whatever had been suggested against long parliaments, it was undeniable, that the constitution was safe under a parliament of years continuance, in king Charles 2d’s reign; that, on the contrary, it was certain, that frequent' elections occasion great heats, and even implacable feuds and divisions between father and son, husband and wife, brother and sister; that, on these occasions, when party-healths go round, the naming of one general before another, often produces a bloody quarrel; and, which is far worse, the sacred name of the church is impiously prophaned in {he streets, and commonly joined with^treason-. After this he made some remarks on our antient constitution, in relation to parliaments; and, in particular, took notice of the great change which, in process of time, has happened in the qualification of the electors, by the increase and plenty of silver and gold species in Europe; for forty shillings a year in freehold, which qualifies a man to vote in elections, was formerly as good as forty pounds is at present: so that formerly the electors were either gentlemen or men of substance, whereas the majority of them are of the dregs of the people, and therefore more suh~ ject to corruption. From all which he inferred, '

503] PARL. HISTORY, 2 Geoko* I.

that frequent elections render our government dependent on the caprice of the multitude, and very precarious. He also took notice* that if the heats were increased since the king’s accession to the crown, it was chiefly b.ecause some persons, v*ho had a great opinion of their own . merit, were not in office; which gave him an opportunity to vindicate his majesty as to the distribution of his favours, and the rewarding those who, in the worst of times, had shewn their zeal for his succession, and, during the late rebellion, ventured their lives for his majesty’s service. Upon the whole matter his lordship was for committing the bill.

The Earl of Peterborough spoke next, and said, That whether he was in employment or bo, he had still an entire affection for the king, and wished be could give his vote for this bill; but that he would not be for a remedy that might cause a greater evil. As to what had been suggested in favour of those who ventured their lives to serve the government, he observed, that men who cannot tight for a cause, cannot die for it. Hd afterwards said, That if this present parliament continued beyond the time for which they were chosen, he knew not how to express the manner of their existence, unless, begging leave of that venerable bench, [turning to the bishops] they had recourse to the distinc-. tion used in the Athanasian creed, for they would neither be made nor created, but proceeding, &c.

The Earl of Nottingham spoke next on the same side, aod said, That he was against this bill, because he thought it would rather exasperate, than quiet the minds of the people. That this bill shewed a distrust of the affections of the people, and an intention of governing by fear, which, in his opinion, was the worst way of government: And God forbid his majesty should have no prospect of gaining the affections of his subjects. That the king came in universally beloved, and was received with the general acclamations of his people: and though be could not assign the true cause of the preseut dissatisfaction, yet some secret cause must have been given for it; That he hoped the people’s dissatisfaction was not so great as it was represented:That the rebellion was entirely suppressed and at an end; but if any ferment yet remained, this bill was a very improper way to alliy it, and would rather rivet the disaffected in their prejudices against the government, tbab make them change their opinion; That one of the arguments urged for this bill, was, That it would encourage foreign princes and states to enter into alliances with us; but that, in his opinion, the same might have a contrary effect, for foreign potentates may be deterred from-entering into measures with us, when they shall be informed, by the preamble of this bill, that the Popish faotion is so dangerous, as that it may be destructive to the peace and security of the government: and may apprehend from this bill that the government'is so weak, as to wautso extraordinary a provision for its

71 <5. — » Debate on the Septennial , 7 [304

safety; which seems to imply that the gentlemen of Britain are not to be trusted in a new election; and that the good affections of the people are restrained to so small a number as that of which the present House of Commons consists. He urged, That frequent and new parliaments are required by the fundamental constitution of the kingdom; and that the practice thereof for many ages was sufficient evidence of this constitution. That' this bill was so far from preventing corruption, 'that it would rather increase it; for the longer a parliament is to last, the more valuable to he purchased is a seat in it, and the greater also is the danger of corrupting the members of it; That whatever reasons there may be to continue this parliament for seven years, will be at least as strong, and, by the conduct of the ministry, may be made much stronger, before the end of seven years, for continuing it still Ipnger, and even to perpetuate it, which would be an absolute subversion of the third estate of the realm. He then hinted at the danger of enlarging the

Ererogative, and instanced in the precedent of ing Henry the 8th who persuaded his parliament to give him the Abbey lands, under pretence that they would bear part of his expences, -which would ease them of taxes, and improve t^ade; but that soon after he demanded and obtained great subsidies, and made use of those lands, which he had so obtained, to enslave the nation.

To this

The Duke of Argyle said, That he could, by no means, agree with the noble lord that spoke last, either as to the beginning or end of the rebellion:That it had been suggested, that the king had been received with the general acclamations of his people; but that \t was certain, and has since manifestly appeared, that whatever arts were used by the last ministry to blind and deceive the people, designs bad been, laid to bring in the Pretender long before the king’s happy accession to the throne: Tlmt the disappointment of these designs was entirely owing to Providence, for had the conspirators thrown off the mask sooner, and improved the ferment their emissaries had raised in the nation, at theelection of the last parliament, ’tis very probable their wicked schemes, for setting aside the Protestant succession, had taken place. That he wondered therefore that any lord could be puzzled to tiod out the cause of the present disaffection; for it was plain it proceeded from the false representations of things and persons that were industriously spread abroad, both before and since his majesty’s coming in. As to what had been suggested, that the rebellion was at an add, he observed, That the Uebela had only shifted their head-quariers from Perth, to Paris or St. Germains, but that their emissaries were still as busy and insolent as ever in [Oreat Britain, and wanted only an opportunity ' to renew the Rebellion, and favour ao invasion.

/ As to what bad been hinted, that this bill, would rivet the Jacobites in their opinions, be said, That was no good argument against it.

for he had seen some persons often shift sides, and change their opinions, and be very zealous for both.

The Earl of Nottingham taking this reflection to himself, readily owned, That he was for some time against the abjuration oath, because lie .thought a multiplicity of oaths would make the nation unsafe, but that as soon as he was convinced of the necessity of that oath, he readily came into it. Hereupon

The Duke of Argylt said, He wa^sorry that that noble lord took to himself what hi said only in the general.

' The Duke of Shrewsbury and Lord Parker who spoke next, declared themselves, the first of them for, the other against the hill: And then

The Lord Cotoper recapitulated the argu-

ments that bad been urged on either side; gave a genuine account of the triennial act, and by .what means it was obtained; and vindicated the king and government as to the present dissatisfaction; appealing to the Lords and Com-.mons, whether the least provocation had been given, either by his majesty or his ministers; and asserting, that if there was any fault on the king’s side, it was too much lenity; and that the only crime that could be charged on his ministers, was their zeal and vigilance in defence of his majesty's person and government.

Then the Earl of Aylesford having answered part! of the lord Cowper’s speech:

The Bishop of London said, That when he came to the House, he knew not which way he should give his vote, and hoped to be guided and determined by what should be offered on both sides on this important subject: but now he owned he was confounded between dangers and inconv?niencies on one side, and destruction on the other.

' The Earl of Anglesea spoke next with a great deal of vehemence against the bill and

The Duke of Buckingham, who had .spoke be-

fore, ' closed the debate with saving, “ That he was for the Bill, but did not think it seasonable."

At length, after a debate that had lasted five hours, the question that the bill be committed, being put, it was carried in the afirmative by $5 votes as follows: Content tf, Proxies

Protest against the Septennial Bi//.] And an the Bill was committed to a Committee of the whole House, for Monday the 16th: whereupon several lords entered the following Protest.

“ Dissentient:

“ lw Because we conceive that frequent and siew parliaments are required by the fundamental constitution of the kingdom, and the practice thereof, for many ages, (which mani-fostly appears by our records) is a sufficient evidence and proof of. this constitution.

“ 2. Because it is agreed, that the House of

VOL.VII.

Commons must be chosen by the people, and when so chosen, they are truly the representatives of the people, which they connot be so properly said to be, wjjen continued for longer time than that for which they were chosen; for after that time they are chosen by the parliament, and not by, the people, who are thereby deprived of the only remedy which they have against those who either do not understand or through corruption do wilfully betray the trust reposed in them; which remedy is to ebuse better men in their places.

“ 3. Because the reasons given for this bill, we conceive, were not sufficient to induce us to pass it, in subversion of so essential a part of our constitution. 1. For as to the argument that this will encourage the princes and states of Europe to enter into alliance with us, we have not heard any one minister assert, that any one prince or state has asked, or so much as insinuated, that they wished such an alteration. Nor is it reasonable to imagine it: for it cannot be expected that any prince or state can rely upon a people to defend their liberties and interests, who shall be thought to have given up so great a part of their own; nor can it be prudent for them to wish such an experiment to be made, after the experience that Europe has had of the great things this nation has done for them, under the constitution which is to be altered by this bill. But on the ofiher hand, they may be deterred from entering into measures with us, when they shall be informed by the preamble of this bill, that the popish faction is so dangerous, as that it may be destructive to the peace and security of the government; and may apprehend from this bill, that the go-, vernmetit is so weak, as to want so extraordinary a provision for’its safety; which seems to imply, that the gentlemen of Britain are not to be trusted or relied upon; and that the good affections of the people are restrained to so small a number, as that of which the present House of Commons consists. 2. We conceive that this bill is so far from preventing expeaces and corruptions, that it will rather increase them; for the longer a parliament is to last the more valuable to be purchased is a station in it, and the greater also is the danger of corrupting the members of it: For if ever there should be a ministry, who shall want a parliament to screen them from the just resentment of the people, or from a discovery of their ill practices to the king, who cannot otherwise, or so truly be informed of them, as by a free parliament, it is so much the interest of such a ministry to influence the elections, (which, by their authority, and the disposal of the public money, they, of all others, have the best means of'doing) that it is to be feared they will be tempted, and not fail to make use of them; and even when the members are chosen, they have a greater opportunity of inducing very many to comply with them than they could have if not only the sessions of parliament but parliament itself, were reduced ta the ancient and primitive constitution and practice ef

frequent and new parliaments: for as a good-ministry will neither practise nor need corruption, so it cannot be any lord’s intention to provide f >r the security of a bad one.

“*4. We donceive that whatever reasons may induce the Lords to pass this bill to continue this parliament for seven years, will at least be as strong, and may, by the conduct of the ministry, be made much stronger before the end of seven years, for continuing it still longer, and even to perpetuate it, which would be an express and absolute subversion of the third estate of the realm.

The Septennial Bill passes the Lords."] April

16. The House of Lords in a committee of the whole Hutise, considered of. the said bill, and most of the Peers who had spoken before, made speeches for or against it.

The Bishop of Rochester, who had not yet spoken on this subject, said, “ That if this bill were never so good in itself, it was very unseasonable, because very un|>ppular, and altogether

• useless, the Rebellion being crushed, and the power of France not be feared; now especially, when we have a glorious standing army, and a ministry that knows how effectually to engage the affections of the 'people.”

The Committee having gone through the bill, and ordered the blank before the word

* years’ to be filled up with the word Seven, the question was put, whether the same should be reported, in order to be’ engrossed, which was carried in the affirmative by 74 voices against 39.

April 17. The bill was reported, and, without dividing, ordered to be engrossed; and being read the third time on the 18 th of April, there arose a debate that lasted about two hours. Near one half of that time was taken up by

The Earl of Nottingham, who, among other things, demonstrated, “ That counsels for enlarging the prerogative, had ever been pernicious to the crown.” To this

The Duke of Argyle said, That not being so well read in history as that noble lord, he would confine himself to what had happened in his own time; and that he had ^observed that his lordship had by turns opposed all that had been offered, either for the interest of the crown, or the liberties of the people, of which he might easily produce several instances; adding, ' he did not wonder there appeared already so much joy among a certain party, over a repeut-ingsinnpr.”

. Upon the whole matter, the question being put, Whether this bill sit all pass? it was earned in the affirmative, by a majority of 69

April 19. The Lords having sent Mr. Justice Tracy and Mr. Justice Dormer to acquaint the Commons, that they had passed a bill intituled,

* An Act for enlarging the time of continuance ‘ of Parliaments, appointed by an Act made in

* the 6th year of king.William and queen Mary/ to which they desired their concurrence:

The Lord Guernsey immediately moved, t reject the bill, without reading it: but because that would have been an unprecedented method of proce eding, the House would not agree to it, but read the bill the first time.

Upon the question for a second reading, there arose a debate, of which the most remarkable passage was, that an eminent member, who had been, in the most difficult times, very zealous for the protestant succession, spoke agdmst the bill, and, among other things suggested, u That it was an imposition of the Lords to take upon them to direct the Commons in a matter, which solely concerns them, as guardian of the rights and liberties of the people.” He was seconded by Mr. Sbippen; but the lord Coningsby made them sensible, “ That their objection was altogether groundless, and the result of their want, either of experience or memory; for, had they, like himself, been members of that House, when the triennial act was made, they might have remembered, that the same was begun in the House of Lords, * who as part of the legislature, are no less guardians of the liberties of the. subject, than the Commons themselves.” Mr. Fuller and the lord Guernsey spoke afterwards against the bill, but were answered by the lord Stanhope, eldest son to the carl of Chesterfield; and a second reading was at last carried by a majority of276 against 156 *

Mr. Tjyddal, who opened the debate, spoke as follows:

Mr. Speaker j You have now under your consideration a matter of as great weight and importance, as, I believe, ever came before any parliament; for where the rights and liberties of the subject appear to be concerned, then certainly it is fit to proceed with the utmost caution and regard. The Triennial act was, no doubt, originally intended as a barrier and defence of those rights and liberties, against any oppressive or arbitrary invasions of the crown: and though we are so happy as to have a good prince now upon Lbe throne, who is likely to be succeeded by one equally so, yet such great blessings were never entailed upon a people. Nobody can be more for supporting the just prerogative, than I am, because I always take it to be a power of doing good: and therefore, if upon the

strictest examination I could find, that what is at present proposed, would throw the balance of power too much on the side of the crown, I should then think it uot only hurtful and dangerous to the public, but fatal and destructive to the constitution. In order to enter farther into this subject, it is proper to look back from whence a bill of this kind first took its rise. In the year 1640. a bill for Triennial parliaments *, or that which was very like it, was passed; but with a clause in it, of a hard and compulsory nature, derogatory to the crown, and, indeed, unreasonable in itself, with many other disagreeable circumstances. It is well known what was the consequence of those unhappy differences, between the king and his people. After the Restoration, in the 16th of king Charles the Second, this act, which immediately preceded a long and bloody Civil war, was repealed by another act, the preamble of which is very remarkable ; f and thus things remained untill some time after the Revolution, when king William was prevailed upon to pass this now, I hope, dying law. I am sure nothing could prevail with me either to enlarge or alter this act, were I not convinced by comparing the arguments op both sides, that the not doing of it is liable to more inconvenience and danger. If you do it, you effectually strengthen the hands of the king; settle and maintain the Protestant succession hv destroying the vain hopes of all its enemies, both at home and abroad. You encourage your allies to join with you, nay, and to depend that what shall hereafter be stipulated and agreed upon, will he. punctually performed. This experiment may, perhaps, at

first disquiet the minds of the people; especially when they are exasperated by all the endeavours of men averse and disaffected td. the government. However, a little time will shew, that it will entirely break our parties and . divisions, and by that means lay a firm and solid foundation for the future tranquillity and . happiness of this kingdom. Besides, if this-, opportunity be lost, you may possibly never have another, at least so good a one, not only to conquer but even to eradicate that spirit of Jacobitism, which has long dwelt among us, and has more than once brought tins nation to the very brink of ruin and destruction. Since therefore, with much danger and difficulty, we have at last secured our religion, laws, and liberties, when all was at stake, from the. treachery of the late ministry, the unaccountable proceedings of the last triennial parliament, why should you run the risk of having a new one so soon, first chosen by French money, and then voting by French directions F . Since the king and his parliament exert their united power for the good of the public, and to retrieve the honour of the nation, why should they not continue longer together, that they may finish what they have so unanimously and so happily begun ? Upon the whole, Sir, the electors and people of all the boroughs in England having been, for several years past, both bribed and preached into the Pretender’s interest, and a dislike of the Protestant succession, it becomes rather necessity than choice to apply an extraordinary remedy to an extraordinary disease; therefore I shall give you no farther trouble, but make you a very short motion, which is, That this bill be committed.

Mr. Shippen* spoke against the bill as follows:

Mr. Speaker; I kgow my duty to tbi? House, and the eonsequence of any unguarded

The noblest testimony to the character of Shippen was given by sir Robert Walpole, when he declared, which he repeatedly < did, “ That he would not- say who was corrupted, but he would say who was not corruptible; that man was Shippen.” Coxe’s Memoirs of sir Robert Walpole.

“ He was consistent in conduct, open and frank in his opposition to the existing government, and of indexible honesty and integrity; but he was known to be disaffected to the protestant succession, and indeed never hesitated to avow his sentiments. This may account for Pope’s panegyric, but it makes sir Robert Walpole’s testimony to his character more manly.* Pope’s Works, vol. 4, p. 80. Bowles’s edit, 1806.

expressions better than to say, that by any hills we have already passed, we have made so wide a gap in the constitution, that the force, of the law is in a manner destroyed; or that, by any thing we have done, we have paved the way to a despotic and military government, the greatest calamity that can hefal a free- born people. Such reflections may come from persons without doors, who, (hough they may with justice complain when their liberties are invaded, yet cannot always enter into the depth and wisdom of our counsels, and are too apt to censure what they do not understand. No member can regularly arraign any bills the same session they have obtained the force and sanction of laws. But this bill, though it hath already got through the most difficult part of its passage, and though it will in all probability be the next law that shall be made, is yet unpassed, is yet before us for our consideration, and we have a right to treat it with freedom; Freedom of speech, I presume, will not only be allowed, but is .expected on this

Stockport school. He was first elected member of parliament in 1707 for Bramher in Sussex; and in 1714 he was elected for Newton in Lancashire, which place he represented till his death. His paternal estate was not more than 400/. per annum; but he obtained a large fortune, 70,000l. by his w ife, daughter and co-heiress of sir Richard Stote, knight, of Northumberland, by whom he left no children:his mode of living was simple and frugal. He kept up a constant correspondence with Atterbury, during his exile; and William Morrice mentions him in one of his letters, as a person who continued fixed to his principles, or, as he expresses himself, as honest as ever. He seems to have had no country residence, except a hired house on Richmond-hill, but made excursions in summer to his wife’s relations in Northumberland. His usual place of abode was London; in the latter period of his life in Norfolk street, and his house was the rendezvous for persons of rank, learning, and abilities; his manner was pleasing and dignified, and his conversation was replete with vivacity and wit.

“ Shippen and sir Robert Walpole had always a personal regard for each other. He was frequently heard to say, Robin and I are two honest men. Re is for king George and I for king James: but those men with long cravats (meaning Sandys, sir John Rushout, Gibbon, and others) only desire places, either under king George or king James.

uBy the accounts of those who had heard him in the House of Commons, his manner was highly energetic and spirited, as to sentiment and expression: but he generally spoke in a low tone of voice, with too great rapidity, and held his glove before his mouth. His speeches usually contained some pointed period, which peculiarly applied to the subject in debate, and which he uttered with great animation/' Coxe’s Memoirs of sir R. W alpole, vol. 3, p. 206.

. 1716. — t/i the House of Commons. [314 > » occasion. I hope therefore, as the business of this day hath raised an universal expectation throughout the kingdom, so gentlemen who are m ore able, (none is more willing than myself) will appear with resolution and spirit in this irapo rtant debate; in this, perhaps, our last struggle for the liberties of those we represent.

I think, then, all the arguments which have been used for this bill, are grounded on mere surmises and imaginations only; are either trifling in themselves, or dangerous in their consequence. One main reason urged, both in the preamble of the bill, and in the debates of the gentlemen who are for it, is this: That the disaffections of the people are so great, and the enemies of the government both at home and abroad so watchful, that new elections will, occasion new riots, rekindle the rebellion, and be destructive to the peace and security of the government, which will all be prevented by continuing this good parliament, and making the time of its dissolution uncertain.

If this argument be applied to the ministry, I can only answer, that it is no concern ofours whether they have rendered themselves odious to the people, or not. They are more properly the object of our jealousy, than of our care. They may he destroyed, and the government subsist. But if it be applied to his majesty, as it must be to make it any inducement to pass this hil], I will venture to say, that none of those, who are called enemies to the governments and abettors of the rebellion, could have offered an argument so: injurious to his majesty’s honour. For with what face cm any good subject insinuate, that in the infancy of his reign he hath deprived himself of the love and affection of a people, who so lately received him with the utmost expressions of joy ? What an unjust idea must this give of his most mild and gracious government ? But the assertion is the more injurious, because it is entirely groundless. For when these pretended disaffections were at the highest, it appeared how impotent they were, how far from being universal, by the easy and sudden suppression of the rebellion:and by consequence how absolutely his majesty reigned in the hearts of his subjects.. Now the rebellion is suppressed, if there should be any remains of those who are ill disposed, the fate of their friends, whilst the terror of it is fresh in their minds, will restrain them from _ any future attempt. Besides, the hands of the government are strengthened. Tiie Habeas Corpus act is not only now, but may be again suspended: You have a numerous standing army distributed through the kingdom, to coutroul and awe unruly spirits. But suppose the disaffections of the people to be as great, suppose the faction, spoke of in the preamble, to be as restless and designing, as is affirmed; is this the way to extinguish animosities, to heal divisions, and to reconcile parties ? No, Sir, it will rather create discontents, where there are none al* ready: It will rather give occasion to thoi*.

315] PARL. HISTORY, 2 Georg* I. 1716__________Debate on the Septennial BUI, [313

that are disaffected, to rail atyour.procecdings; to say, that your actions are such that you dare not venture on new elections: and who knows what such suggestions may produce ? It is possible when the three years for which you are now chosen, shall expire, they may insist, that they are unrepresented in parliament; and this will be a better handle, a more plausible foundation for the faction to work upon, than they could have at the time of a regular election. Now, if the continuance of this parliament be intended only to calm men's minds, and that it is hoped this storm may by degrees subside, gentlemen will be pleased to consider, that we are but a little above a yfar oldj though we have done so many great and glorious things, and that there will be no necessity, as the law stands, of a dissolution this year and half: and that nobody can imagine discontents will last so long under so wise, so ugerring, so pacific an administration, as we now enjoy.

Another reason insisted on is, That as the continuance of this parliament may prevent commotions at home, so it may hinder any invasion from abroad, by encouraging our ancient allies to enter into new treaties with us, which they will not otherwise do. This is a secret which, in my humble opinion, ought not to have been revealed; this is an argument highly improper to be urged in a British parliament, for it supposes, that our allies prescribe to our counsels, and that they expect we should alter the present frame of our constitution, before they will favour us with their friendships; which is a thought not to be endured in this place, where so many millions have been raised for their service, and must move the indignation of every Englishman, especially if it comes from any state that first received its being, and afterwards its protection, from England. I hope never to see this uation brought so low, that the crown shall be directed, as was once attempted, when to remove or keep its ministers, when to dissolve or continue its parliaments. Sir, his majesty, as king of Great Britain, is the arbiter of Europe, and may dictate to other nations. They will, for their own sakes, court his friendship; they have always found their account in being allies to the crown he wears. The British treasure and the British armies, have made them triumph over their enemies, and establish the balance they wanted. It is farther said, that by this bill you will restore the prerogative to part of its power, which is cramped by the Triennial Act. Now, if this bid is to be understood to relate to alliances, it weakens and not strengthens the prerogative. For it is an insinuation, that the people have something to do in making treaties, which must ever be denied by the friends of the crown, where the sole undisputed right is lodged by the constitution of this kingdom. Besides, if that was ftny consideration here, this argument is also a reflection on the present ministry, who are to have the honour to advise his majesty in any pittances he shall think fit tQ make; for it bath

an appearance, as if they durst not look a new parliament in the face; or, as if by some demerit or other, they should not continue id their posts, without the help of this bill, long enough to assist in supporting those alliances when made. It is true, we have bad of late a sort of Triennial ministers, as well as parliaments. But we are to hope, that the present set of ministers, who so far surpassed all their predecessors in wisdom and virtue, will behave so well, as to deserve the continuance of his majesty’s favour, and the kingdom’s approbation. Their friends ought therefore rather to reject, than to inforce this argument; as reflecting on them, and groundless in itself.

There h another reason, drawn from the great and continued expences occasioned by frequent elections, which is so weak, that it scarce deserves to be taken notice of. For every gentleman is a judge of his own circumstances, whether he will or can be at the necessary expences of an election:corrupt ones are not to be supposed, especially in this House, which, all the.world knows, was chosen without the least corruption, without the least violence, without the least improper influence whatsoever.

As to what is said, That frequent parliaments are the cause of obstructing justice, and binder candidates from being impartial in the distribution of it; it is equally trifling with the reason last mentioned; and, if any, is an argument only for making parliaments perpetual. For he who will be a great deal biassed by his hopes of securing his seat in a Triennial Parliament will, by the same principle, be a little warped by his expectation of sitting in a Septennial one; and he ought in neither case to be a member of this House; for nothing can effectually cure such a disposition; it will never be able to resist greater temptations, and court-preferments.

These are the chief arguments for passing this bill; and I humbly conceive they now appear to be of no great weight: but the reasons for letting the law stand as it does, are such as, in my opinion, cannot receive an answer.

First, If there were not abundance of other arguments against this bill, the manner of its coming hither, is a sufficient objection to it. It is sent from the Lords, and as it chiefly re-’lates to ourselves, I shall apprehend it inconsistent with our honour to receive it. We ought to imitate the spirit which our predecessors ever shewed in resisting all attempts of this kind, all appearances of innovation by the Lords# Our predecessors were so very jealous of their privileges, that they never failed to. exert themselves, even on the smallest and most minute occasions. Shall we then I shall' this glorious House of Commons be so far from doing that, as humbly to take a new model of our constitution from them ? Surely we shall not sit tame, and acquiesce meanly, when they think fit to strike at the foundations of this House.

3I7J PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I.

But if cihy here could be inclinable to receive the dictates of the Lords, or to speak out, the dictates of the ministry, I humbly apprehend it is not in our power to consent to this bill. For I cannot conceive, by any rule of reason tor law, that we, who are only representatives, cau enlarge to our own advantage the authority -delegated to us; or that by virtue of that authority, we can destroy the fundamental rights •f our constituents. I know indeed, that the notion of the radical power of the people hath •been extended to a degree of extravagance and absurdity, which I would never be supposed to contend for. But it is self-evident, that this power with relation to the part we bear in the -legislature, is absolutely, is solely in the electors. You have no legislative capacity, but what you derive from them. You were chosen wider the Triennial Act, and could only be chosen for three yea, rs, unless they could convey more to others, than they had in themselves; unless they could give us a longer term to represent them, than they could claim at the time of their choice to be represented. Our trust therefore is a Triennial trust; and if we endeavour to continue it beyond its legal duration, from that instant we cease to be the trustee's of the people, and are our own elec-tore; from that instant we act by an assumed power, and erect a new constitution. If we could dissolve or alter the form of any one part of the legislature, why not of the whole? And that is a doctrine I presume will not be advanced here; I am sure it will never be allowed in any other place. But I know it is a very . unacceptable way of speaking, to dispute the power of those to whom one speaks; and it may be thought a presumption if (should affirm in this present parliament, which hath given sp many proofs of its omnipotence, that even the whole legislature cannot do every thing. I must however always be of opinion, that though it is a received maxim in civil science, that the supreme legislature cannot be bound; yet an implied exception must be understood, viz. that it is restrained from subverting the foundations on which it stands; and that it ought not, on any pretence whatsoever, to touch or alter those laws, which are so far admitted int<* the constitution, as to become essential parts of, it. I am also of opinion, that we cannot pass this bill, because it would be an infraction of the act of union, which I hear almost every day in this place called an irrepealable and fun--damental law. ' But since the representatives of North Britain axe satisfied in that point, it would be highly impertinent in me to insist upon it.

But if nothing stood in your way, if it was <never so much in your power, I think you ought not to repeal the Triennial Act, except in the last extremity, and in the most imminent danger of the State. This law was one of the fruits of the Revolution:This law restored the freedom and frequency of parliaments, so far as was consistent with the circumstances of v*hat.reign, which was involved, in a war, and

17 Id. — in the House of Commons. ' [31S

had occasion for constant and heavy taxes: This law was a concession made to the people by king William, in the midst of his difficulties, and I own the policy of those ministers, who shall advise his majesty to give his royal assent to the repealing of it, is of too refined and delicate a nature for my understanding. For since his majesty has been pleased to propose that prihee as a pattern to himself, and is pursuing his steps with so much glory, it will be a matter of astonishment to those who are not in the secret of affairs, to see, that in the reign of the one king every, thing should be done to enlarge the liberties of the people, and to restrain his successors from being capable of relapsing into the errors and ajouses of former princes; and that in the reign of the other, there should be the least appearance of doing any thing which might but seem to stretch the prerogative, to invade, and shock the rights and privileges of the subject, when both shall be found to rule by the same principles of liberty, and by the same maxims of government.

The Triennial Act is grounded on the ancient usage and constitution of parliaments; as it is intended to oblige the crown to call them frequently. For that, parliaments were held frequently, half yearly, or annually at least, appears not only from the best accounts we have of the first institution of them, and by the two acts of Edward 3, but by the writs of summons still extant, and several authentic instru- ments and records. However satisfactory it might be on any other occasion, I am sensible that a deduction of the history of ancient parliaments, as they were successively, called, would be very tedious and unentertaining in this debate; and I will therefore only mention two. records. One is that famous instrument of Edward 1, concerning the Annuus Census, then claimed by the popes from the crown of England:wherein he takes notice, that some arrears, incurred on that head, had not been raised, as they ought to have been ‘ in Parliamento, quod circa Octavas Resurrectionis Tjo-

* rninicse celehrari in Anglia consuevit •/ But he promises that he would recomment the payment of the money due, in alio Parliamento nostro,

‘ quod ad finem Sancti Michaelisproxime futuri

* intendimus, dante Domino, celebrare.* The other record is a representation from the parliament to Richards, some passages of which are these — 4}uod ex antique Statuto habent,

* et Consuetudine laudabili et approbata, cujus

* contrarietati dici non volebit.’ That the king is to call « Dominos et Proceres Regni atque

319] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I.

From the former of these records, it is obvious to observe, that Edward the 1st who was one of our best princes, and so great a preserver of the laws, of his kingdom, that he is justly called by the historians the English Justinian, chose, rather than to prolong the sitting of his parliament beyond their usual time, to dissolve one, though it had not finished its necessary business, and to summon another within the Space of a few months. From the other it is very remarkable, that Richard 2, who is said to be one of the worst kings that ever sat on the throne of England, by absenting himself from the business of parliaments, and by that means continuing their sessions beyond their proper, and accustomed time, drew upon himself a sharp remonstrance from both Houses, and was at last, for such practices, amongst other things, deposed.

Many reigns after this, Henry 8 accomplished what Richard 2 only attempted, and he continued his last parliament ad libitum without reproof. But it is well known what exorbitant powers they vested him with; and God forbid vre> should have any resemblance of those times; for that parliament acted like slaves, and that king acted like a tyrant.

But if the Triennial law had not been grounded on the reasons of antiquity, and the original usage of parliaments, it was no more than a reasonable indulgence frftrp the throne to the people, who had -struggled for a revolution, on account of the abuses of parliaments, and the endeavours to render them insignificant. It is true, that prince once denied his royal assent to it; but afterwards he considered, that it could be no diminution of his prerogative, no blemish to his regal powers, to retrieve the honour and dignity of parliaments, as they were his support, as they were the essential part of that constitution he came to save:and this he found he could only •do by the frequent calling of them.

Besides, this law was not only a reasonable indulgence to the people, as hath been said, hi that it gave them frequent opportunities of changing their members, when they did not approve their behaviour, and was of advantage to the public, in making them act with more than ordinary caution and circumspection; but it proved of great service to the crown:For by frequent parliaments the crown could only know the immediate'sense of the nation, which is absolutely necessary for a prince to know on all emergencies. However inconvenient thi9 law may now be thought to the crown, and •however opposite to some projects and schemes an active ministry may have in. view, I appeal to experienced members whether they ttnnk, or can imagine, that the crown could have got half the money it hath been supplied with •since the revolution, but by new land fresh elections. Such grievous and perpetual taxes would never have been endured from a stale and continQed parliament. There'is no injury or dishonour therefore to the crown, to be obliged by a law, to do what, in justice to the

1716. — Debate on the Septennial Bill, [320

subject, and convenience to itself, it ought to do without a law.

But if you had a power to repeal this law, and exercise that power, the people would be in a muoh worse condition, than if it had never been granted to them. They would be bound up for ever in a legislative way, the only way effectually and irrecoverably to lose their liberties. They would by us, their representatives, condemn short and frequent parliaments, and establish long and pensioned ones, which is a new doctrine, and such as was never before advanced by the Commons.of Great Britain.

Surely there must be some secret cause, some latent reason for hurrying on this bill in so precipitate a manner. The true reason, I believe, is not declared; and for my part, I cannot but suspect, that the ministry have something to do which they apprehend will not be acceptable to a new parliament, and which will not staod the test of the nation. I say, it must be something they have to do; for 1 am confident they do not self-coqdemn themselves, for what they have already done. They have no remorse of conscience for apprehending so many hundred gentlemen, and confining them in prison so many months without examination. For such confinements were not only necessary to suppress the rebellion, but we havebeen told were intended as a favour and kindness to the persons who were so confined. It must therefore be some new work they have upon their hands; what that work is I will not presume to guess. Bat I will presume to say, what it cannot be. It cannot be a design to abolish the limitations of the Act of Settlement with relation to foreigners; because that is no less than an open violatyon of our new Magna Charta, and an entire infraction of our original contract, as the government now stands.

I fear I have quite wearied your patience, but the importance of the subject will in softie measure excuse me, and I have but a very few words now to add. 1 hope you will reject and not commit this bill. For .there is nothing mqre certain, than that it will be to yonr dishonour and disservice to pass it/if we may reason of what will be, by what hath been. Long parliaments then wHl naturally grow either formidable or contemptible.

We have an instance of the one, in the long parliament of king Charles 1, which to its eternal infamy overturned the best constitution in the world, the church and monarchy of this nation. We have a proof of the other in the long parliament of king Charles the 2d. I ask pardon if I am heard by any that were members of it, but I only repeat what others have said. There was a famous simile applied by {Julian). Johnson to that parliament, which I the rather mention, because it was much applauded by the ; patrons of liberty and lovers of parliaments; and because I know the author is esteemed above his deserts by some gentlemen, who are now debating for long parliaments: it is this, ‘ That a standing parliament will always stagnate, and be like a country pond *

sy ] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I.

which is overgrown with dueks meat/ I make no application; no man will, or can, with any colour of truth or reason, apply it to this parliament. This parliament is so far from being a stagnating pool, that it might rather be compared to a rapid stream, or an irresistible torrent, which, if continued, will bear down all before it. '

' Mr. Hampden replied as follows:

Mr. Speaker; The House is now entered on the exercise of a power, which, of right, and agreeable to the constitution, belongs to them; 1 mean that branch of power which they, as a

Jiart of the legislature, have of repealing laws or xtending and limiting them, in such manper as shall appear to them most conducing to the service of their country. As this right of altering the laws does undoubtedly belong to the legislature, it ought to be used with the utmost regard J since it is equally a crime to enervate laws that are found to be a support to our government, as to omit the abolishing or suspending such as have not answered their end when made, or which is worse, as have proved jjetriipental.

It is a commendable zeal, when gentlemen in their debates express a tenderness for the existing constitution of their country, and their apprehensions oY the least innovation in the frame of the government; and I am not surprised that it is objected, in so popular a manper, that the passing of this bill for suspending the law for the election of triennial parliaments, is to sap the foundation of pur English liberties. But if) upon an impartial enquiry, it shall ap-ar, that this bill, which was made for the nefit of the nation, has, in no respect, answered the purposes for.which it was calculated, when made into a lpw, I presume it may be allowed, that the danger in suspending it is more imaginary than real. And since it is as unjustifiable to be tenacious of a matter that ' has no argument to support it, as not to give way to what experience has demonstrated, if (his bill should, in its consequences, be void of proof of its answering the ends for which it was nftade, I hope it will not be so great a crime to suspend it, as it has, with industry, been represented without doors.

A principal argument for continuing the triennial bill is, that it is agreeable to the ancient laws of this nation, that there should be frequent parliaments. I find by the laws I have looked over, that parliaments ought to be frequently held; but I find it no where laid down as a fundamental position of the nature of this constitution, that there should be frequent elections. If gentlemen will look to the beginning of parliaments, they will find, in the 4th j 5 th, and 36th of Edward 3, that, For Redress of divers mischiefs and grievances which daily happen, a parliament shall be holden every year or oftener, if need be.’ Let it then be considered in what manner those parliaments were held: When a king inet his parliament, they used to sit ten or twenty days.

1716. — mthe House of Commons. [322

and then were prorogued or dissolved; and there were frequent intermissions of parliaments, none being called for several years. By looking over the Journals, we find the prorogations and dissolutions of parliaments.

To come down to the time of Henry 8th, few of his parliaments sat more than twenty days, though there was not a parliament met every year; and from the 7th to the 25th of Henry 8th, there are no Journals, and, consequently, we cannot tell in what manner parliaments were held. Afterwards tlrere were several parliaments, but not every year, to the end of his reign.

A parliament was called the first year of Edward 6, and in five years sat but four months. In Philip and Mary there were four parliaments, but the sessions extremely short. From the 2d to the 5th, and from the 7tii to the 13th of queen Elizabeth, no parliament met, and from the 14th to the 25th of queen ^Elizabeth, the parliament sat only from the' 8th of May to the 30th of June; and four years after, from the 8th of February to the 8th of March following; and in eight years after, never sat to do business, but were then dissolved. There were six other parliaments called in queen Elizabeth’s time; but never sat long unless that in the 39th of her reign, which sat four months.

The parliament in the first of James 1, sat about four months, and in three years after, sat about eight days. That parliament was not dissolved till the 9th of James, but sat twice

. or thrice only. There were three other parliaments in his reign, -but they met very seldom.

The sessions in king Charles 1, were much shorter than of late days, w ith very frequent prorogations; and in the 16th of his- reign art act was passed, 4 For preventing Inconveniences by long intermission of parliaments, ’ by which it was provided, that a parliament should meet every three years; which law we find repealed in the 16th of Charles 2, by reason that the provisions in the former law were looked upon as a derogation to his majesty’sjust and undoubted prerogative for calling and assembling parliaments, and might bean occasion of manifold mischiefs, and might endanger the peace of his people. The said act is repealed, and a provision made therein, that Because by the ancient laws of this realm, in the reign of Edward 3, parliaments are to be held very often; (he sitting and holding of parliaments shall not be intermitted above three years/ In this king’s reign the long parliament was held; and whatever conuption* they were tainted with, they could never be accused of favouring the cause of France, or attempting to enslave their own country.

In the reign of king James 2, that unfortunate prince, a parliament was held in May 1685, fend sat above two months, and was, at several times, prorogued to November 1687. Then the happy revolution took place; and in the Bill of Rights, 1 Guliel. et M a rise, it is declared and enacted, 4 That all the rights and li-.

I Y ‘ -

323] PAUL. HISTORY, 2 Gequce I. 1716. — Behaic the Septennial Bill, [324 ’

* beities asserted and claimed in the said De-

* claration, are the true, ancient, and undubi-

* table rights and liberties of the people of

* this kingdom, and ought to be firmly and 1 strictly holden. and observed.’ And in the same bill, among that long catalogue of grievances, which precedes the said declaration, there is not the least mention made of want of frequent elections, but only that parliaments ought to be free. In the 6th of king William, this now favoured bill for triennial parliaments was passed; and upon this occasion I cannot 'help observing, that it is some satisfaction, that the people abroad who lookmpon the leign of that prince as a usurpation, should be fond of any one act that passed in that time; and I .hope from hence, they may in time be more reconciled to the Protestant succession, which is in consequence of that Revolution.

If gentlemen will look'over the writs of summons, and the returns of those writs, they will find no mention how long any parliament is to last; but the return makes mention of the persons who are to serve in the parliament that i& to meet, and be held at such a time at Westminster. It must be allowed, that the parliament is subject to the triennial act while it subsists; and therefore the advantages or inconveniences of that law ought chiefly to be considered in the matter now before us: And in case an act be found prejudicial, if such a veneration is to be paid to a law, as not to alter it, from any conviction of its being insufficient, or attended with ill consequences, I ' think the legislature will become, in a manner, useless. I take the principal matter to be, to examine what benefit has accrued to the nation by (virtue of this bill, and if the inconveniences do not outweigh all the advantages ?

It is pretended, that by the Triennial elections, the people have an opportunity of laying aside those persons with whose behaviour in parliament they are dis-satisfied or .such whom they apprehend to be under court-influences:I desire it may be considered how yery few examples there are, of persons, who having accepted places, have not been re-elected. The reason is very obvious: Because the people, who loveexpences, judge that a man who has a place of profit, is much more capable of making an expence, than he that has none. But supposing any gentleman so wickedly disposed, as to sacrifice his opinion to the lucre of a place, does not such a person, who Has spent five or six hundred pounds at his election, and his circumstances not veiy able to bear it, come more prepared for court-temptation, than if he had enjoyed his seat in parliament, and beeri free from the trouble and expence of frequent elections ? I appeal to gentlemen, if expences are not increased ? And if any instance can be produced where they are abated, many more may be where they are increased; so that the end of the bill, i n this respect, is no ways answered.

•See vol. 5, p. 487,

It is said, that expences being voluntary, it is the fault only of those who make them; but when we observe the contagion of expences to be universally spread in the kingdom at the time of elections, and a dissolution of manners occasioned by such expences, it is time for the legislature td interpose, and prevent the dangerous consequences of such an evil. Do gentlemen consider the distractions occasioned by election, and the impossibility, considering the small interval of elections, to heal up those wounds which the animosities of parties have occasioned, so that it is little better than living in a continual state of warfare. This is a no less fatal than undeniable consequence of this bill, which was calculated for the ease of the subject.

It is said, the reason of this expedient, as it is called, is because the majority of this parliament are Whigs:and though it is allowed that this parliament has acted for the service of his majesty and the nation, the proceedings of the last parliament are said to be as meritorious of the king’s good opinion, and the nation’s, as wlmt this parliament has done.

It is much insisted on, that the Tories gave the Civil List: that is true; but had they not given it, I believe the king would not have been deprived of it. It is said the king was received here with the universal joy of his people:why did that satisfaction cease so soon, ? Has the king done any thing to lose the affection of so many of his people ? or have his ministers ? If his ministers, why has the spirit of patriotism been so much wanting in gentlemen, as not to represent to the king or in this House, the crimes of those be employs in his service? But if no real handle for these discontents has been given by king or ministers? then those who pretended such a zeal for the king and his service, at his arrival here, acted a hypocritical part, and meant nothing less than what they now make professions of. Let us consider the present situation of the minds of the people, how exasperated one set of them are at the necessary prosecutions of those, who so fatally concerted the ruin of their country; and to what degree that restless spirit influenced the people in the late rebellion; apd how industriously a false and mistaken cause of the church has been of late propagated in this nation.

From these and many other circumstances of affairs, and other symptoms of the ill temper of the nation, I think the disposition of the peoples miuds far from being suitable to the business of an election, but rather for a restoration of that person, who the deluded people have been taught has alone a right to the crown, and is to come* to free you from the oppressions you now lie under.

So much has been said concerning the preparations which the Regent is making, by extorting vast sums from the subjects of France; and so much has been spoken concerning our alliances, and the necessity ofapplying ourselves to find out effectual methods for discharging the

825] PAUL. HISTORY, 2 George I

public debts, that after so long a debate, I •ball net trouble you with my thoughts upon those subjects.

It must be allowed, that the nation has obligation to those patriots who framed this law, with a view and expectation it would prove a secure provision for the liberty and ease of the subject: but could those great and honest men have foreseen into what a degenerate state this nation would fall, they would have been convinced how sufficient and cobweb a remedy such abill must prove, and they would scarce have been content with leaving to posterity a legacy, which experience has shewn to be destructive, instead of any real advantage to them. I humbly apprehend, that when laws do not answer their end, or prove prejudicial in their consequences, it is the duty of the legislature to interpose; and that the suspension of this bill is so far from being a violation of our constitution, that it is the healing a breach made in the constitution, by those who obtained this law.

The reasons why I am now for the bill are, To dispose the people to follow their callings and to be industrious, by taking from them, for a time, the opportunity of distracting oae another by elections: to prevent such who have the will, from the power of giving any new disturbance'to the government: to prevent another rebellion, there being just as much reason to expect one this year, as there was the last; to check that evil spirit in those who have sworn to the king, and rose in arms against him, or abetted such who have: to discountenance that spirit which lately did so far prevail in this nation as to approve of a most ignominious conclusion of a successful war, by a ruinous peace: to render fruitless any concerted project of the Regent, or any other foreign princes, to disturb this nation at a time when elections, or the approach of them, have raised a ferment in the mind of the people; and to procure to the clergy an interval from being politicians, that they may be the better able to take care of their flocks, in the manner the Scripture has prescribed. — For these and many other reasons, too long to enumerate at this time, I am for the commitment of this bill.

Sir Richard, Steele spoke next for the bill, as follows;

Mr. Speaker, It is evident that new chosen annual parliaments were never the custom or right of this kingdom: it remains therefore .only to consider, now that there is a law, which makes parliaments meet, as of course, at such a stated time, whether the period of three years answered the purposes intended by il ? The preamble to the Triennial act expresses, that it was introduced into the constitution for the better ‘ union and agreement of the king and his people but it has had a quite contrary effect, and experience 'has verified, what a great man [meaning the late earl of Sunderland] said of it, when it was enacted, ‘ That it bad made a. triennial king, a triennial ministry, a triennial alliance/ We feel this in all occurrences of state; and they who

1 1 16. — in the House of [82G

look upon ns from abroad, behold the struggle in which we are necessarily engaged from time to time under this law. Ever since it has been enacted, the nation has been in a series of contention:the first year of a Triennial parliament has been spent in vindictive decisions and animosities about the late elections; the second session has entered into business, but rather with a spirit of contradiction to what the prevailing set of men in former parliaments had brought to pass, than of a disinterested zeal for the common good: the third session languished in the pursuit of what little was intended to be done in the second; and the approach of an ensuing election terrified the members into a servile management, accord-ding as their respective principals were disposed towards the question before them in the House. Thus the state of England ha9 been like that of a vessel in distress at sea:the pilot and mariners have been wholly employed in keeping the ship from sinking; the art of navigation' was useless, and they never pretended to make sail. It is objected, 1 That the alteration proposed is a breach of trustThe trust, Sir, reposed in us, is that of the public good the King, Lords and Commons, are the parties who exercise this trust; and when the King, Lords, and Commons exercise this trust by the measure of the common good, they discharge themselves, as well in the altering and repealing as in the making or confirming laws. The period of time, in this case, is a subordinate consideration; and those gentlemen who are against the alteration, speak in too pompous a stile, when they tell us, ‘ we

* are breaking into the constitution/ It has been farther objected, That all this is only ‘ giving great power to the ministers, who may

* make an arbitrary use of itthe ministers are indeed like other men, from the infirmity of human nature liable to be made worse by power and authority; but this act gives no addition to that authority itself; though it may possibly prolong the exercise of it in them. They are nevertheless responsible for their actions to a parliament; and the mode of enjoying their offices is exactly the same. Now, when the thing is thus, and that the period of three years is found, from infallible experience itself, a period that can afford us no good, where shall we rest ? The ills that are to be done against single persons or communities are done by surprize, and on a sudden; but good things are slow in their progress, and must wait occasion. Destruction is done with a blow; but reformation is brought about by leisurely advances. All the mischiefs which can be wrought under the. Septennial act, can be perpetrated under the Triennial; but all the good which may be compassed under theSeptential, cannot be hoped for under the Triennial. We may fear that the ministers may do us harm, but that is no reason why we should continue them under a disability of doing us good. For these considerations, I am unreservedly for the Bill, thus;

Mr. Snell spoke against the bill.

Mr. SpeakerWe are told there is an abse-

32^]

lute necessity for the bill which is now before you, and that those who oppose it, are no better than friends to a Popish Pretender. But as I wish as well to his preseut majesty’s person and government, irs the most zealous for his service, I shall never resign my opinion to words only, and betray my trust, to serve the purposes of a ministry. — I cannot but think this bill, if it pass into a law, will highly infringe the liberties of the people; and as I can by no means assent to the reasons that are offered to prove it necessary, so i shall heartily give my negative to it. — I do not wonder to hear a necessity urged for altering the constitution of our parliaments, by those who have given up their own.

[This last expression, which was supposed to ' be owing to Mr. Haddon’s, a Scots men>ber, having declared for the bill, was resented by Mr. Thomas Smith, who said, That Mr. Snell would not be so bold as to speak those words any where else. He was seconded by lord Coningsby; and the dispute .being like to grow warm, Mr Speaker interposed, and said, That all the membershaving the privilege of explaining themselves, Mr.. Snell ought to have the li berty of so doing. Hereupon Mr. Snell said, That he meant no personal reflection on that worthy member, for that he spoke on|y of. the Scots nation in general. To which sir David Dalrymple replied, That Mr. Snell’s explanation increased the offence, instead of lessening it, and that he demanded satisfaction. — Some other members also calling out To the Bar, To the Par/ Mr. Snell excused himself, by begging pardon for any unguarded expression that might have escaped him:Upon which the affair dropped, and be went on as follows :]

Sir; — The chief arguments made use of for the bill, as it repeals the Triennial act, and continues the present parliament, are, To appease the groundless animosities of the people:To avoid expences, which frequent elections occasion, to the impoverishing of many gentlemen’s families; To obviate tumultuous riots and assemblies, which might give a handle lo a second rebellion:and, lastly, To further our alliances abroad. — How we can possibly expect to quiet the groundless animosities of the people by this bill, I must own, 11 am at h loss to imagiue, nnless stripping them of their most valuable privileges, which they and their ancestors have for many ages past exercised and enjoyed, may be thought a proper expedient to reconcile their affections, and endear the present administration to them.

The expences at elections are merely voluntary, and if anyone suffers by them he has none to blame hut himself; and I scarce believe gentlemen to be serious in this particular; for let us look but a little backward, and trace this mischievous evil, this growing corruption, that needs such an extraordinary remedy, to its original, and we shall find it has its rise from the same place whence the remedy proposed had its beginning; and that former ill ministries, the better to forward their sinister views, have,

by sending their agents through the kingdom, at an approaching election, debauched the people with the public money; to Rhat pitch 6f corruption we are now arrived. It is otherwise impossible to give an account hoW so many ged-tlemen are chosen to serve in parliament, in counties and places where*they have no visible estates or interest; nay, some perhaps whoSe names were never heard of in the county 'a month before the election.

The Rebellion is happily now at an end, and the government so much better secured against riots and tumultuous assemblies, by the wholesome laws provided by the wisdom of this parliament, that little or no danger can be reasonably apprehended from thence; especially, if We consider the number of forces prudently quartered throughout the kingdom, sufficient tt> suppress the most daring commotions thdt shall be attempted.

The last reason made use of to prove the necessity of this bill, is, that it will enable the government the better to treat and negociate foreign alliances. Bur surely those who make use of this as an argument, are strangers to the constitution of England; for by the known and standing law of the land, the right of making peace and war, treaties and alliances, are undeniably the king’s prerogative; and the king may exercise that right, as to him seems best, and most for the good and benefit of his people, without application to parliament, either to approve or confirm. But admitting that of late years parliaments have thought themselves intitled to interpose their advice in treaties and alliances, though I deny it to b$ their right, this is an argument singly sufficient with me to support the Triennial Bill. For supposing^ ministry shall at any time negociate an alliance prejudicial to the interest of England, aftd by their artifice impose upon a parliament to approve and confirm it; is it not a peculiar happiness, that such a parliament will quickly hare an end; and that the people have it in their own power, by another, which must soon he called, to correct the misdeeds of such a ministry, and prevent the farther ill Consequences of such a treaty to the nation.

But allowing the arguments that are made use of sufficient to prove the necessity of Repealing the Triennial Bill at present, I would beg leave to consider, whether it be in our power or no, to continue the present parliament beyond the time for which the people chose us ?

And as for jny own part, 1 freely declare it as my opinion, though I siiajl always acquiesce in the judgment of the majority, that the purport of this bill, so far as jt relates to the continuance of this present parliament, is not within the compass of the trust reposed in us by the people. And to satisfy gentlemen that I km not singular in this opinion, I would beg their patience to read to them a passage or two from Mr. Locke’s Treatise of Government. Thfe ‘ power of the legislative, says he, being derived

* from the people by a positive voluntary grttat

* and institution, can be no other than what that

* positive grant conveyed; which being only to

* make laws and not legislators, the legislative can

• hav6 no power of transferring their authority of

* making laws, and placing it in other hands. Again, he lays it down as a rule, ‘ That when the

* society has placed the legislative in any as-

* sembly of men, to continue in them and their < successors, the legislative can never revert to

* the people whilst that government lasts; be-

* cause, having provided ar' legislature with ‘ power to continue for ever, they have given ‘ up their political power to the legislative and ‘ cannot resume it; but if they have set limits

* to the duration of their legislative, and make ‘ this supreme power in any person or assembly ‘ only temporary; at the determination of the ‘•time set, it reverts to the society, and the ‘ people have a right to place it in new hands/

I beg pardon for the length of the quotation; but as the author, in his life* time, was always esteemed a man of great learning and candour, and no ways suspected as disaffected to the succession in the house of Hanover, 1 could not omit taking notice of the sentiments of so great a man, so conducive to a right understanding of the point now in question. And if these positions are true, the inferences are very obvious; the people of England have a fundamental indisputable right to appoint their representatives in parliament; and by a law still in being, for three years and no’ longer, subject to the king’s power of dissolution, have chosen us their representatives, in pursuance of that law; and therefore, whenever that Triennial term shall expire, have a right to chuse new ones.

It may he objected, That when the people have once constituted the le’gislative, that the legislature is thereby vested with the whole power of their electors: and it cannot be denied, but, generally speaking, it will hold true. And the people of England, having chosen us to represent them, we are thereby impowered not only to make laws, but to alter or repeal guy law in being, as we shall think fit, for their benefit and security; and they will undoubtedly be bound thereby. But then this is to be understood, where the subject-matter of the laws we make is Within compass of the trust, Which the people have or may at least be supposed to delegate to us; and it is in an ill way of reasoning to assert, that we have a power to do what we Cannot do without prejudice to those we represent.

The right of electing representatives in parliament, is inseparably inherent in the people of Great Britain, and can never be thought to be delegated to the representatives, unless you will make the elected to be the elector; and, at the same time, suppose.it the will of the people, that their representatives should have it in their power to destroy those thatmade them, whenever a ministry shall think it necessary to screen themselves from their just resentments:this would be to destroy the fence to all their freedom; for if we have a right to continue ourselves one year, one month, or day,

1716. — fn the House of . [330

beyond our Triennial terni, it will unavoidably follow, we have it in our power to make ourselves perpetual; and whatever necessity we may be reduced to hereafter, matters are not yet in that apparent bad condition, to convince the people that there is a present occasion for this dangerous innovation in their constitution.

To say that the passing this Bill is not to grasp to ourselves the right of election, but only to enlarge the time for calling new par-iaments, is a manifest fallacy; for wheneve.il our three years are expired, we can nq longer be said to subsist by the choice of the people but by our own appointment; and it is a jest to tell me, I have a right to that which another has a right to take from me.

, Whoever will consider well the frame and nature of our constitution, will find it calculated for every circumstance needful for the security of a free people. We are guarded by our representatives in parliament, against any arbitrary encroachments of the supreme executive power; and by frequent and hew parliaments, against the weakness, folly, and corruption of our representatives:and though many instances may be given of lohg intermissions of parliaments, yet that does by no means prove frequent and new parliaments not to be part of our constitution; and it is obvious to every impartial person, that without thern our constitution is defective. For these reasons I cannot approve of this bill: I think it an open violation of the people’s liberties, or, to speak most mildly of it, a breach of our trust in that part which- will most sensibly affect them; and of that ill tendency in its consequence, that as nothing but the security of the ministry can make it at this time needful; so nothing but a standing force can make it lasting.

Mr. Bromley spoke next against the Bill:

Mr. Speaker; I may Venture to affirm, that the Bill now before you i9 of higher concern to the Commons of Great Britain, than any that ever yet was before you: it takes away the people’s right of appointing their rfepresentatives, it deprives them of their share in the legislature, and, in my opinion, wounds the constitution of parliaments very deep.

No gentleman is ignorant, that the frame of our government is made up of the King, the Lords, and the Commons. These, with respect to each other, ljave ever been esteemed separate, although, when put together, they make but one entire government. / The duration of this form of government’ in England, . longer than in our neighbouring countries, is manifestly owing to the care taken by those that went before us, in keeping these three constituent parts of the political body up to the rules of their first institution, by restraining each to its proper bounds, and in not suffering one to be over-born, or swallowed up by the oth^r two:. however these three great parts

831] f>ARL. HISTORY, 2 George I.

may in other respects be considered, yet with reg&rd to the legislative they must act in conjunction. The assent of each to the ipaking of laws is essentially necessary, but the manner of giving this assent is different in the people, from What it is in the. king, and in the lords. The people, by reason of their number, can-hot be personally present at the passing of laws, their assent can no otherwise be signified, than by their representatives. The disadvantage the Commons are, in this respect under, is in some sort made up to them by the care taken in the framing of our government, that they suould be truly and fairly represented.

That elections shall be free, is often declared in our written laws. It is in effect saying, - that neither the power of the crown, nor the power of the lords should interpose in them. The resolution of this House, renewed every session, viz. That for a lord to concern himself in the

* election of members to serve for the Commons *in parliament, is a lfigh infringement of the ‘ liberties and privileges of the Commons of

* Great Britain/ sufficiently shews the jealousy the Commons ever had of the Lords intermeddling in the elections of their representatives.

The attempts made on the king's part, towards influencing elections, have been principally by officers under the nomination of the crown. As this mischief from time to time appeared, laws were introduced providing against it. The statute 7 Hen. 4, c. 15, recites that law to be made < At the grievous complaint of

* the Commons of the undue elections for par-

* liament, ’ and directs, among* other things,

* that sheriffs should proceed to elections freely £ and indifferently, notwithstanding any com-

* mand to the contrary.’ Many subsequent laws were made for preserving to the people this privilege, on which all other depend, of being faithfully represented in parliament. No less than seven acts were made in king William’s time for that purpose: so greatly did the endeavours of officers to influence elections at that time abound. The statute of 3 Will, and Mar. c. 1, takes notice, That the officers of

* the excise, by reason of the greatness of the

* duty, and the extraordinary powers given to

* them, had frequently, by threats or promises, *so far prevailed on electors, that they had been absolutely debarred of the freedom of

* giving their votes; which, according to the

* known constitution of this kingdom, every per-

* son ought to have and enjoy.’ It then enacts,

* that any such officer who persuades or dis-

* suades any elector from giving his vote, shall

* forfeit lOOZ. and be incapable of executing any

* office relating to the excise.’ Another law of the like nature was lately made in relation to the officers concerned in collecting the post-office duty. These laws are now all to be laid as]eep. Provisions made for protecting the people’s right of election must become insignificant, if elections themselves are no longer to be allowed.

The care taken by the founders of our go-

; 116. — Debate on the Septennial Dill,

vernment to preserve this right, did not stop here; it was not sufficient to that purpose, that elections should be free; it was likewise necessary that they should be frequent. The people’s-right to frequent elections was founded on substantial reasons:for since they, who could act no otherwise than by representatives, were capable of being mistaken in their choice, and the person chosen liable to be tempted over to a dependence on the crown, or on the Lords, and " thereby receive an undue influence, it became necessary that frequent opportunities should be given to the Commons to correct their choice, and thereby prevent the danger which the unfaithfulness of their representatives might otherwise bring upon them.

That the people had a right to frequent election's, is made unquestionable by the best of evidence, perpetual usage. From the first footsteps of parliaments, down to the time of Henry 8, not only from records, hut; from the printed statutes, the frequency of elections does appear. The most repeated instances, within that period of time, are of parliaments determining within the compass of a year; no instance where they continued longer than three.

King Charles 1, that unfortunate prince, was put upon governing without parliaments; but the necessity of affairs forcing him to change his purpose, a parliament was called in the 16th-year of his reign, in which a law' of an extraordinary nature was passed, viz. ‘ That in case ‘ the king did not call a parliament within three ‘ years after the determination of the preceding parliament, then the lord chancellor, &c.

1 should issue writs for that purposewith many other extraordinary provisions. That parliament ioon after perpetuated themselves, so far as it was capable of being done, and by an act made the same year, f they were not to ‘ be dissolved but by act jnf parliament. ’

To the long continuance of which parliament were all the calamities of the civil war to be imputed.

This statute of the 16th of Charles 1 was repealed by the statute of the 16th of Charles 2, c. 1. But notwithstanding the fond humour the nation was then in, even by the same Act it was declared, That by the laws of this realm,

‘ parliaments are to be held very often, ’ and to the end there might be a frequent calling, assembling, and holding parliaments once in three years at least, it was declared and enacted,

‘ that parliaments should not be intermitted 1 above three years at the most. ’

In king Charles 2d’s time another turn of policy was taken, which was to bring the House of Commons to the bent of the ministry^ by the secret application of pensions to the members. Such was the modesty even of that age, as not openly and avowedly to bias with offices, those wiio ought at least to he the faithful representatives of the people. For the effecting of this pernicious purpose of corrupting the Commoas, it was necessary that the parliament should be prolonged; which it was for eighteen years: assurance of which being privately given to

333] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I.

many of the members, and there being time sufficient to gain upon others, not so far intrust-, ed with the secret, the design was effected. And such was the behaviour of chat parliament, that it acquired the infamous name of the Pensioner-Parliament.

The attack thus made 6n the constitution of parliaments, by depriving the people of their right of frequent elections, gave birth to the jealousy the nation entertained, of the intention that prince had-ol assuming to himself a despotic power. How uneasy the later part of his reign became on that account, is well known; and this nation has ft It the effects of the fervent and divisions which then arose; and by the artifice of ill-designing ministers, have been ever since continued. The people being warned by the narrow escape their liberties met with from that parliament, did, after much struggle, obtain this law of Triennial Parliaments, the only remedy left for preserving their ancient constitution. And now, after above an hundred millions given by the people, in order to preserve their old form of government, here is a bill sent us by the Lords, which if it passes, must expose us again to the greatest of dangers, which is that of a long parliament.

In ithe time of that Pensioner-Parliament, wrhirti began in 1663, the means of temptation in the minister’s hands, were not so great as they now are:the Civil List is well nigh double to what it then was:the dependence on the crown is greatly enlarged, by reason of the increase of officers for managing the public revenue and funds. What influence these may have upon an exhausted nation, under the terror which 40,000 regular troops carry with them, is easily foreseen.

No wonder the Lords, who are ever fond of power, have sent us a bill which admits of their having a share in the nomination of the House of Commons:but I cannot guess what should induce them to expect our concurrence. Surely they cannot think so meanly of us, that for the sake of continuing our seats here, we should give into what so'greatly affects the rights of those that sent us. Can we be thought so ungrateful, as to join in the destruction of the power that raised us ? Can they think us so unfaithful, as to he tray our trust in this gross manner, by renouncing our relation to the people, and accepting from the crown, and from themselves a renewal of our right to sit here ? should they imagine us no longer to be 'influenced by the rules of justice and morality; yet methinks they should allow us to have some sense of shame remaining, vyhich must give us pain when we return into our countries, and look those in the face whom'we have so greatly injured. 1

I would take notice of a matter that was mentioned in the debate, viz. That supposing

* this bill should undergo the forms used in the> M passing of bills, whether it would carry with it

* the obligation of a law ?’ Of this I own myself much in doubt. The powers we are in- trusted with, at representatives of the people.

1716. — the House of Commons., [334

appear in the form of a writ for summoning the parliament. And in the indentures annexed to> the return, the writ recites, Whereas we have ‘thoughc fit to call a parliament, touching di-‘ vers urgent affairs, concerning us, the state, and

* defence of our kingdom of Great Britain, ’ it then requires, ‘ That the sheriff do cause two ‘ to be elected knights, &c. to act in, and consent to what shall be ordained by the com-‘ mon council of Great Britain, super negotiis

* antedictis.’ The indenture, annexed to the return, answers the writ, viz. ‘ That they have < elected such and such to attend according to

* the tenor of the writ, and given them full (power to act in, and consent to, all things in

* the said parliament, which shall be by com-‘ mon council and consent ordained, touching ‘ the state and defence of his majesty’s king-

* dom of Great Britain.’ The question then is, Whether the authority thus given us to act, touclring the defence of the'government, does enable us to lay aside one of the three great estates, the people, by denying them their right of acting by their representatives in parliament and consequently their share in the legislature f does the power put into oiir hands by the people Justify our turning the dagger into the bowels of the constitution ? This doubt is Increased, by the notion that prevailed touching the in validity of the statute of the 16th Car. 1, t. 7, wherebythat parliament was not to be dissolved but by an act of parliament. No act ofparliament was ever made for that purpose; which would certainly have been done, had the subsequent parliament thought that a law made in diminution of the people’s interest in the legislature had been valid, (it is to be observed, that by an Act of the Convention that met in April i660, the Long Parliament that met in 1640 was declared to be dissolved: hut that act was not confirmed by parliament, as most of the other acts of that Convention were by the statute of the 13th Car. 2, c 7.)

“ I should be very willing to-hear answered what a worthy member who just now spoke for committing the bill, and owned his sentiments altered touching the Triennial Act, has told the world in an excellent Treatise of this-[Meaning Mr. Molesworth, in his Preface to his Account of Denmark] ‘That no people can ‘give away the freedom of themselves and their ‘ posterity:that such a donation ought to he

* esteemed of no greater validity than the gift ‘ of a child, or of a madman:that people can ‘ no more part with their legal liberties, than ‘ kings can alienate their crowns.’ Every body is sensible that the public occasions will require large supplies; and should so much as a doubt arise in men’s minds touching the legality of the taxes, it will tend to increase the general dissatisfaction, so often'mentioned in this debate, and subject us to hazard there is no occasion to run, did we content ourselves with proceeding in the common methods, which the usage of many ages does justify. For these reasons I aiR against fcoiqmitting the bill.

S35] PARL., HISTORY, 2 George I. MiQ. — Debate 09 Septennial Bill, [435

Sir Robert Raymond* spoke likewise against the bill as follows:

Mr. Speaker; I am very sensible under what disadvantage I must speak after so long a debate: I will therefore endeavour to contract what occurs to me, on this subject, and to avoid repeating what has been said before by other gentlemen. And in what I have to offer I shall observe this method; I will first consider the arguments that have been used for this bill, and then give my reasons wby I am against it.

The arguments for the bill are, I think, chiefly these:the expences in elections., The animosities and divisions made and continued by triennial elections; the advantages our enemies may take of these animosities and divisions; and the encouragement, I think no gentlemen has spoke plainer, that this bill will give to our allies to treat with us, and to enter into proper alliances, for Our mutual benefit and advantage.

As to the expences in elections, it must be acknowledged that they are grown very scandalous as well as grievous and burthensome to the gentlemen of England.-They have increased upon them, not from the contests of neighbouring gentlemen with oneauother, but from strangers, by what influence or direction 1 cannot tell, coming to their boroughs, who have no natural interest to recommend them, nothing but bribery and corruption, which has put gentlemen under the necessity of great expences to preserve their interests, and serve their country. And you must give me leave to add, that another cause has been, the impunity that bribery and corruption have met with in this House, when they have been very, notorious, and very fully detected. But, I fear, this bill can be no cure to that evil, it will rather increase it; for as the term of the continuance of a parliament is prolonged, so the expences will increase with it. An annuity for seven years deserves a better consideration, than for three; and those that will give money to get into parliament, will give more for seven than for three years. Nothing will so effectually prevent expences, as annual parliaments: That was our ancient constitution, and every departing from it, is usually attended with great inconveniences.

As for our animosities and divisions, I am sorry there are any, but canuot believe this bill will be a remedy for them. The animosities and divisions raised by elections are of a private nature, and little affect the public; those that do, are otherwise to he accounted for, which might have been extinguished; but the opportunities have been neglected, and I wish some

persons have not studied rather to continue > and increase them, than to extinguish them. I will speak plainly on this occasion, I think the greatest animosities and divisions, the greatest discontents and uneasinesses now among us, have been owing to the unreasonable resentments, avarice, and ambition of some, and to the unaccountable folly and madness of others.

That our enemies will take advantage of our divisions, is not to be doubted, if it is in their power; but 1 must observe, that since the Triennial act passed, there have been ten several parliaments called, most of them when you were actually in war, your animosities and divisions great, and your enemies vigilant; yet noimfonveniencies followed, nor were any, as I have beard of, so much as attempted at the times of those elections.

The last of the arguments I have recited, is the encouragement this willgivfeto your allies to enter info treaties with you. No one says they want this encouragement; no one says they ask it; so that I may conclude this is only 9 pretence. I should be sorrjr we had such allies as would not treat with his majesty without our giving up our constitution. Should the like be asked of them, they would certainly entertain such a proposition with the contempt and indignation it deserved. But what you are now going to. do, instead of strengthening the king’s hands, will, I am persuaded, lessen him in the opinion of his allies:for this is proclaiming to the world, that he dares not- call a new parliament: that he dares not trust the people in a new choice. Besides, not daring to call a new parliament, carries along with it a supposition to the dishonour of this House: for it supposes that another House of Commons would act differently from the present:whigh is to confess that this House does not truly represent the people; that they and their representatives are of different minds; and that if they were to chuse again, they would N chuse men of other principles, of other sentiments. j

I will hot trouble you farther with answers to the mgaments for this bill; those against it, that weigh most with me, are these: That frequent new parliaments are our constitution; that a long parliament is plainly destructive of the subjects just right, and many ways inconsistent with the good of the nation. Is it reasonable any particular men should for a long time engross so great a trust, exclusive of other?; can it be of advantage to the public, that the counties, cities, boroughs, should be long confined to thpse they have once chosen, their interests admitting of great variation iu length of time?

Frequent new parliaments are our constitution, and the calling and holding of them was for many ages the practice. Before the conquest, parliaments were held three time? every year, at Christmas, Easter, and Whitspntide* In Edward the Sd’s time it was enacted,

* That parliaments shpuld be holdep every year

337] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 1716 — the House of Commons. [333

once, or oftener if need be.' This must be understood of new parliaments, for prorogations and long adjournments were not then known; they were never heard of till later years. They began in Henry the 8tb’s time, that prince and his ministers knowing long parliaments were best fitted to make great changes. They were therefore inventions when extraordinary things were to be done, when what was then the church was to be altered, and the church lands to be taken away. There is nothing of this sort now, I hope, intended. From that time our histories tell us, that whenever the same parliaments were long continued, or the meetings of parliament long discontinued, they gave great uneasiness. In the unfortunate reign of king Charles 1, there had been an intermission of parliaments 12 years, which produced an act in the 16th year of that king For thepreveut-

* ing the inconveniences happening by long inter- mission of parliaments/ That act, in the preamble recites the law made in the reign of Edward 3, ‘ That parliaments ought to be held

* every year once; but that the appointment

* of time and place belonged to his majesty and ' his royal progenitors:And that it had been

* found by experience, great inconveniences ' and mischiefs had happened to the king, and

* to the commonwealth, by not holding parliaments accordingly/ And for the prevention of the like for the future, it enacts, That the

* said laws shall be strictly observed; and that

* in case there be an intermission, of the sitting

* of parliament for three years together, if there 'is a parliament in being, that parliament

* shall be dissolved, ’ and very extravagant powers were given for the calling and assembling of another: ‘ And every such parliament was ' not to be dissolved of 50 days, without their ‘ own consent/ This extraordinary step was soon followed by an act intitled, ‘ That the

* parliament should not bedissolved, prorogued

* or adjourned, but by act of parliament; nor

* the Houses of Parliament adjourned but by ' themselves respectively/ I need not be particular in recounting the consequences of this act of parliament; for every one knows, that set of men, when they had thus continued themselves, never stopped till they had murdered the best of princes, and entirely subverted our constitution both fn church and state.

Soon after the Restoration of king Charles 2, the act for the preventing the inconveniences happening by the long intermission of parliaments was repealed, because derogatory to the prerogative, and because it might be an occasion of many mischiefs and inconveniences, and endanger the public peace and safety; but at the same time it is declared and enacted, '.That because, by the ancient laws and sta- tutes, parliaments are to be held very often,

* the sitting and holding of parliaments shall ' not be intermitted above three years at the ' most/ This law not having been so well observed, as it ought to have been at the Revolution in the Convention Parliament, when it was thought necessary to declare the rights and

liberties of the subject, after, many breaches had been made upon them, it was, among other things declared, '* That parliaments Ought to ‘ be held frequently/ And what follows in that act is very strong, for it declares and enacts,

(That all and singular the rights and liberties

* asserted and claimed in the said declaration,

‘ are the indubitable rights and liberties of the ‘ people of this kingdom, and so shall be es- teemed, allowed, adjudged, and taken to be;

' and all the particulars thereof shall be firmly

* and strictly holden and observed, as they are ' expressed in the said declaration/ The right claimed and asserted, is, That parliaments

* ought to be held frequently And soon after a new parliament was called, which sate annually: But this was not looked upon to be a complying with the right claimed, and therefore, after that parliament had sat three times, in the fourth session it was thought necessary to come to a farther explication, and a passed both Houses, but was rejected by ths throne, For the frequent meeting and calling ‘ of Parliaments/ Others were attempted in the next session, and it is well knbwn how they came to miscarry in this House; but in the succeeding session, a Bill passed both Houses, and had the royal assent. That is the act this bill is to alterBut before it is altered, I hope it will be shewn, that what is asserted in the preamble, is mistaken, and has proved otherwise. In the preamble two things are asserted,

‘ That by the ancient laws and statutes of the < kingdom, frequent parliaments ought to be ‘ held; and that frequent new parliaments tend

* very much to the happy union and good agree-

* ment of the king and his people/ The first proposition is incontestable; and the latter, I think, will not be denied; for frequent and new parliaments create a confidence between the’ king and his people, a very necessary step towards an union and.good agreement. If the king would be acquainted with his people, and have more the hearts of them, this is the surest way; and I am persuaded this House will never consent to any thing that may prevent the one, and intercept the other.

I cannot entertain so unworthy a thought of this House, that any gentleman in it would at this time, in direct terms, be for perpetuating themselves; yet if they consent to this bill, I shall reckon they are doing it; for though it only prolongs this parliament for seven years,

I cannot doubt but hereafter there will be another for continuing it longer; because, before the end of this term, the reasons will probably be stronger for it, than they are uow; Neither can I imagine that gentlemen are afraid to trust the people’s choice again: Do they think that the great and memorable things this parliament has done for the service and benefit of their country, will make them less acceptable to the people ? No one will say so; and then I see no reason why they should be for making this alteration in our laws and constitution, which will certainly have a very ill effect upon the minds of the people: For they will be

SJD] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 1710 — Septennial mi, [34fr

ready to say, and wifh reason, that after the. expiration of the three years, you are no longer their representatives, ' because they chose you to serve them no longer. With great submission 1 speak it, in my poor opinion. King, Lords, and Commons can no more continue a parliament beyond its natural duration, than they can make a parliament., I know at extraordinary junctures, conventions have been turned into parliaments: but it has been thought advisable soon to determine them, and to pass, acts in the subsequent legal parliaments, to confirm what they have done. And I make no doubt, but if this bill passes into a law, and this, parliament is continued more than three years, there will be an act in the succeeding parliament to confirm whatever shall be done after jlie three years. There is a'ri instance in (your statute-book, where all the acts of a parliament were declared void, and repealed, because the parliament was unlawfully summoned, and the members not duly chosen.

T need not, urge farther, that the wisest governments that have preserved a face of liberty, have never continued those long, with whom they .have iutrusted the supreme power. That By this'bill, you have all the mischief of a long parliament, without any of the good of a short one. That a standing parliament and a standing arnly are convertible, and only necessary to support ond anoth'er. And that there can Be no occasion for this bill at this time, because this parliament may have two more sessions, if the king pleases. Rut as I have already taken up so much of your time, I shall only add, that for the reasons, I havd given, i am againist committing this bill.

Mrf Archibald Hutcheson, spoke against the Bill thus.

Mr. Speaker; I cannot content myself in the great question now before you, to deliver my opinion barely by voting in it; for I think it of that importance to the nation, to deserve and need the most thorough examination. I heartily wish it might have had a much longer time of consideration, than I perceive gentlemen are disposed to give it; but since we are entered on the debate of it, I shall endeavour to express my thoughts about it with great plainness and freedom.

t My present opinion, Sir, according to the best judgment I am able to form, is, that if we should - give our consent to the passing of the bill before us into a law, we should be guilty of the most notorious breach of the trust reposed in ps, by those who sent us hither, and should make a very dangerous step towards the undermining of that constitution, which our ancestors have been so careful to preserve, and thought no expence, either of blood or treasure, too much for that purpose, and under which we do yet enjoy those privileges and ad-

vantages, which no other nation in the world can at this day boast of.

This is the light1 itf which the bill Vet appears to me; and therefore iff didbelifeve what some gedtlemen do, That it would be conducive to several good ends, yet that would' not be sufficient to gain my consent thereto; for I cannot think those ends, however desirable, equivalent to such a price, as that of giving up, or even making a dangerous advance towards the giving’ up entirely, the British Constitution. Much less would I "give my consent to such a law, when I am of opinion, Thar it would be sri far from contributing to the ends pretended tor be aimed at thereby, that it would'have the "direct contrary effect: and if we are not to do evil that good may come of it, surely we must not do evil, only to bring mischief upon odrselves. »

These are my reasouS against the bill. That our consent to it woula be a breach of trust, and a dangerous breach upon our con- -stitution; and" that, if it were rtdt liable to this objectiort, That yet it would serve to purposes directly Contrary to those pretended to be aimed at, by gentlemen who are for the-bill; I shall endeavour to explain ihySelf in these points.

Give me leave therefore to mention, what appears to me to have been tlrd' ancient constitution of parliament, and also how the same has been and stand's changed at this time, With relation to the matter which is now the subject of our debate. I believe it will, nay, it must be agreed, That before the reigh of Henry 8, there was no single instance of a prorogation of parliament: That parliament^ bad only one sessions, and those generally veiy short ones, none 6F which ever lasted a year:That to prevent the mischief of long intervals of parliament, it was enacted in the 4th year of Edward 3, That parliaments should he holden annuhlly, arid this was confirmed by subsequent acts of parliament: and therefore I may venture to affirm; that by the ancient constitution, parliaments were to be holden frequently, and to be of the continuance only of one sessions, and that there Was no right or power in the crown t6 prorogue fhd same: I Say, this 1 can affirm, on the same foundation, and with as string riason, as I can affirm, That the eldest son, after the death of his father, shall inherit, as heir a’t law, the land's in fee-simple; or that the youngest son shall inherit, w^eri the custom of Borough-English prevails; or that all the sbria shall equally inherit the lands of Gavel-kind; or, indeed, as I can affirm of any part of fhe common law, or thC particular usages of the kingdom; for these ate supported drily by constant practice and prescription immemorial; and they neither need nor can have a stronger support than this; for surety of all laws, those must be allowed to’ carry with them the strongest evidence’ of justice, which have been always submitted to, without any change or alteration.

The application is obvious to the point in Rebate, I mean as far as the reign of Henry <6; and if qt that time this was the constitution of parliament it will not be easy to .$hew how the saa^e has been since legally changed ; but I shall speak .to this more fully, after I have answered an objection which has been qiatje. It has beep said, ‘ That it is no ‘proof that the croyvn had .po power to pro- rogue pprlipipeqts and to continue the same ‘ parliament iqr several sessions, although there

pere no .instances thereof until the reign ‘ qr Henry 8/ If this objection have any weight it will equally hold against any ' other , pqrt of the common law, which hath hitherto remained uncontested: for may not the younger sons, in this way of reasoning, .say, That .although there be no instance, that' any of them .have hitherto claimed to inherit, ^quaJly w^jth the.eldest, the lands in fee-simple, .that yet is .no proof against their right of .making such a claim, and leaving it determined for them. And if such a case should be .brought into Westminster Hall, it is evident, that there is no act of parliament which settles the point, nor any preceding resolution, because the matter was never in question before; j and yet surely no gentlemqn will.affirm, that! the judges would, he at liberty to determine, this as a new case, whatever equity they might conceive in the pretensions of the younger: .sons, but woqld he strictly tied to adjudge according to the constant and uninterrupted usage. And had the Lords and Commons, when the first attempt of proroguing was made upon them, insisted, that the crown had no such power, and the opinion of the judges had been required therein, it was impossible _tl»at they , cou|d have determined otherwise, than according to the constant usage, or that they wopld have adjudged such ap original .power in t, he crown, which had never been .exqrted, Irani the.earliest mention which our records, or .history, make of parliaments, to .that vqcy day: or that they cou|d have con-^ceived it possible, that tfye crown could have .bad such a power, and yet never asserted it in one single instance, in the course of so many hundred years.

If the facts I hpve mentioned are, as they appear ^o pie tp be undeniably true, the inference I tlience make is next to a .demonstration; and I may venture to. add, That there is no part of pur laws built on a more .solid fouudatiqp, qqji .supported with stronger reasons: reasons which must eternally have the gepatest weight, and make the deepest impression on the miqds of a people, who have j^ny sense of liberty; and, thanks he to God ! we are, yet a free nation. For without the frequency of parliaments, the opportunity of redressing .those grievances wopld be |ost, which, more pr less have happened in all reigns, from rthe influence and ailministration of evil coun-^ellors, and wicked ministers, yho willalways prefer their own private interests and sinister views, 4(0 the bon°ur of their prince, pnd welfare of their

country: and it is to the dread which speh impious monsters have always had, 1 hope, will ever have, of the just vengeance of a parliament, that »e hitherto owe the preservation of opr liberties; for, had the times of being called to an account in parliament been at any considerable distance, the attempts of l^ojd and daring men would have had lio curb; and jndeed it is but one step more, and that not difficult, from a long to the intire disuse of parliaments, and resolving the government into an absolute monarchy; hut I will urge this point no farther, because I believe it will be generally allowed; and that, whatever {night be the private opinion of any particular pqrson, no Britop will be yet so hardy, as to declare himself against the necessity of frequeiit parliaments.

I wish, gentlemen would as generally concur, that the other part which I have mentioned, and I think have made appear, to have been our ancient constitution, .were as absolutely necessary to the preservation of our liberties; 1 mean parliaments of one session^ not only frequent, but frequent new parliaments. The tiling indeed appears very evident to me; so evident, that in my poor opinion, our liberties would npt Ue more, may not so precarious under an absolute monarch, as with a House of Commons who had right to sit either for many years together, or without any limitation of time; for it is certain, that g prince, who had stood only on the bottom of his own absolute authority, assisted pith a few ministers and some troops, would still think himself pretty much upon his good behaviour towards the united body of his people; and would (probably) be cautious of exerting his power in such a manner, as to give a just provocation to a general revolt, and setting up another in his stead; but a prince with a parliament at his devotion, would be (infinitely more terrible, and with much greater security, might give a loose to every extravagancy of power; for when the representatives of the people, who are chosen by them to be the guardians of their liberties, can be prevailed on, for little advantages to themselves, to betray their trust, and come into all the measures of a designing ministry, it is then, indeed, that the liberties of a people .are in the most imminent danger; and surely, there is great reason to apprehend, that a House of Commons might soon become very obsequious to a ministry, if they were to sit for a long period, or without limitation, and that there were no near day in view of a new election, when the conduct of gentlemen in this place would he enquired into in their respective countries.

I believe ityvill not he denied, That it is very possible for a ministry, by pensions and employments to some, and by the expectations raised in others, and by the corruption of electors, and returning officers, to obtain a very .great majority, entirely and blindly at their devotion, even at the very first meeting of

SI3]

a parliament, and that by a committee of elections and other proper helps, their party may daily increase; and that such a parliament may he so far from protecting the liberties of their country, or from being a terror to evil ministers, as to become themselves the tools of oppression in the hand of such a ministry, and by their authority, to consecrate the worst of actions, to declare every honest patriot, who has the courage to attempt to stem the tide of wickedness, and to stand up for the liberties of his country, to be its greatest enemy; and those who are ready to give it up, to be the only true friends of our constitution; and if this should ever happen to be our case, I beg gentlemen to consider, Whether a greater curse could fall on any people than to have such a parliament as this entailed upon them.

I feroember very well, what an outcry was raised against the last parliament, on a suspicion only, that a repeal of the Triennial Act was in-« tended, and - the arguments against it without doors, were then the very same with those which are now urged against it within:What an inconsistency must it then appear, to see those very gentlemen, who were then the most zealous opposers of such an attempt, hecome now, the most violent advocates for it ? And will it not also in some measure affect their integrity, publicly to own, that the arguments they pretended to be then influenced by, had not the least weight with them; and that the thing in itself was very desirable, when there should be a good ministry and parliament in being, and pernicious only in the then situation of affairs ? It was not. certainly from this consideration, that the late ministry and

; arliament were diverted from the attempt:’hey, doubtless, had a very £ood opinion of themselves, and were confirmed therein by the voice of a great majority of the people, and which, by a most strange and unaccountable witchcraft, still continues in their favour, if I may depend upon what Several who have argued for the bill seem to have agreed to.

1 must beg gentlemen to consider, that the mischief I have mentioned, will be no ways prevented by the present posture of our affairs; for though we may have now a good ministry and parliament, their continuance, notwithstanding the intended law, will still depend on the pleasure of the prince; for I do not. perceive that any gentleman will move for a clause to continue the ministry for life; or that the parliament shall not he dissolved without their own consents; and if, by ill advice to his majesty, a change should happen) may it not so fall out, that a long continuance of a new ministry and parliament, may be of infinite prejudice to the nation:Surely, therefore, it will be wisdom, in. the making of this, or any other law, not to consider some little present con-, teniency, but the general and obvious tendency of the same. I therefore think that I am yet warranted to say, and shall say it, till I am convinced that I have mistaken the matter, That frequent new parliaments was the ancient

— Debate on the Septennial BUI, [844

constitution; that until the reign of (Heniy 8, there was no stronger evidence for any part of the common law, than there was for this part of our constitution; and that the same was built, and stauds upon as solid a foundation as anylaw ever did, or can do, being absolutely necessary and essential to the liberties of a free people.

It is true, Henry the 8th, in the 21st year of his reign, prorogued the parliament, which was the first instance of this kind, and succeeding princes have, more or less, .continued the same practice; but I can in no wise agree, to what some gentlemen would thence infer, That the crown had always a right to do so; for I think I have made the contrary very evidently appear; and that until the 21st of Henry the 8tb, no part of our common law was better established than this ancient English constitution of frequent new parliaments; but it is remarkable, that this having been the first instance of a prorogation, it was thought convenient to strengthen the further continuance of that parliament by adjournment also:If the crown, before the time I have mentioned, had not the power of continuing the same parliament by prorogations; it will not be easy to shew, bow they have come legally by it since: Sure I am, that there is no act of parliament which vests any such power in the crown, and prescription immemorial is not so much as pretended to. The short of the matter seems to me then no more than this: A very arbitrary prince, the better to serve the ends he had then in view, boldly invades the liberties of his people, and usurps a new prerogative, unheard of before; That parliament tamely suhmits thereto, either out of fear, or for baser reasons; perhaps they were pleased with a. longer continuance, and the agreeable prospect of sharing in the advantages of laws, which they were afterwards to make, I mean, the dissolution of abbies; and although thereby the foundation of our happy Reformation was laid, yet that is intirely owing to another cause, and in no wise to the pious intentions, either of that prince, or of that parliament. This new prerogative was at first used with much caution, and thereby the fatal tendency thereof was not so soon discovered; and when the possession of this power became strengthened in the crown by a continuance of time, and the acquiescence of the nation, it was much more difficult to get rid of the innovation, than it was at first to Have prevented the same; and it has been, I presume, thought more prudent to continue oar acquiescence, whilst the inconveniences were in any measure supportable, rather than to endeavour to retrieve this most valuable part of our ancient constitution by force of arms; although this remedy hath' been resorted to frequently, and on much slighter occasions in my opinion.

But I cannot see, that from a power so assumed, and so continued, it will follow, either that the ancient constitution was so, or that it ought to be so at this day; and I must say, that whatever arguments can be brought to support that doctrine, will equally justify the

PARL. HISTORY, 2 George L 1716.

345] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I.

exercise of any other part of arbitrary power; for upon the starting up of any new prerogative, it is but saying, That the crown had always a right to it, although it wa&never claimed or exercised before; and there may be parliaments complaisant enough to acquiesce therein, which perhaps might be ashamed, by a new express law, barefaced and unmasked, to give up the liberties of their country; and I do not see, but that this would be as good a commencement for any new prerogative, as the power of proroguing at first had. Let gentlemen consider, what the andient laws of England were, in the matter of imprisonments, and what the practice was for some time before’the act ef Habeas Corpus. I hope there is no Briton so abandoned to the notions of slavery, as to affirm, that it ever was by the laws of England, ih the power of the prince to imprison any of his subjects during his will and pleasure, and without any reasons assigned:They were to be imprisoned, only, when legally charged with crimes, and were either to be tried for the same, or released from their im-1 prisonment, in a reasonable time; and as to this, the act of Habeas Corpus was not intro-ductive of a new law, but declarative only of the old; this is so essential to the being of a free people, that it must be agreed, that our law was always thus: I am sure, without it, our condition would differ little from the slavery of Turkey; for the bow-string itself, 9 speedy death, is mercy, when compared to a lingering confinement. And yet it is certain, that before the act of Habeas Corpus, the good subjects of England were sometimes thus arbitrarily and illegally imprisoned, to gratify the avarice, ambition, malice, or revenge of evil counsellors and wicked ministers; and the advocates for prerogative did as strictly insist on the legality of this power, as they did on any other which was claimed by the crown. I cannot indeed tell how long this power of arbitrary imprisoning had been exercised, but I am apt to believe it may vie for antiquity, with the power of proroguing parliaments.

I must also put gentlemen in mind of the prerogatives claimed and exercised by king James the 2d, to dispense with the laws, to command our bishops and clergy to read in their churches his illegal proclamations, and to suspend and imprison them for disobeying, with many others of the like kind, which are recited by the Claim of Rights; and it is certain, that had we not been rescued by the Revolution, all these and many more, had been good prerogatives at this day, and might have been all of them supported with as good arguments, as any can be used for the power of proroguing in the reign of Henry the 8ch; and some of them with as good, nay, with the very same arguments as are used for the legality of the power at this very time. I hope therefore we shall be very cautious of admitting such arguments, as tend naturally to support all extravagancies of power whatsoever, and to let in upon us an inundation of oppressions.

1716. — in the House of Commons. [34(5

In the late reigns, and in particular by the long Pensionary Parliament, in the reign of Charles the -2d, the nation became very sensible of the mischievous consequences, which had already happened, and the more fatal which might still result, from the dangerous breach which had been made in our ancient constitution:It was now evident to the meanest capacity, That a designing prince, who, with the assistance of a wicked ministry, should be able, after several trials, at last to procure a parliament to his purpose, would have the liberties of his people entirely in his power, and might govern them at pleasure; from which state of slavery it was evident, that nothing less than a revolution could rescue them; and if they failed in that experiment, that then their chains would be riveted for ever. Under this melancholy prospect of affairs the nation groaned, and complaints were heard in Cvery corner of our streets; and even the very pensioners in that parliament, were not arrived to such a pitch of impiety, as to take pleasure in the drudgery they had engaged in, bnt acted with reluctancy and remorse, and as we have been very lately told io this place, betrayed the cause they had so wickedly espoused, and frequently gave notice to the friends of England, of the attempts which were to be made on the liberties of their country. This Pensionary Parliament was at last dissolved, but on what views, and by what advice, I will not pretend to say. Certain it is, that that prince never had it afterwards in his power, in a parliamentary way, to destroy the liberties of the people. The resumption of charters was then put in practice, with many other expedients, towards the establishment of an absolute monarchy, which had been long in view; But by the death of that prince and the unskilful conduct of his next successor, an end was put to those designs for that time, the people having unanimously applied the only remedy in such cases, and this brought about the late happy Revolution.

I have been often surprised, when I reflected how wanting we were to ourselves upon that turn, in not retrieving and securing for ever* by the Claim of Rights, our ancient constitution of frequent new parliaments, which, in my poor opinion, was much more valuable than all that we claimed besides; but we obtained this in part, by the act passed in the 6th year of the reign of king William, and which the .bill before us is intended to repeal; for by that act, we are to have new parliaments, at least once in three years; and even this is such a security to the British liberties, that all the objection i against triennial elections are but iery trifles, when compared with that: Therefore I am not a little surprised, when I hear gentlemen say, That the Triennial Act is a new constitution, and that the repeal intended thereof, will be but restoring the sing in part to his prerogatives, and setting the constitution a little nearer to what it anciently was; surely there is nothing farther from the truth of the fact:

317] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 1716- — Debate on the Septennial Bill, [31$

The ancient constitution was, at least, annual new parliaments, and this was broke in upon, and that breach afterwards continued in the manner which 1 have already set forth:and by this act we have no new privilege granted, but only restored in part to those which we always had a right.to. But were it in reality a new grant: Shall we give it up only, to enlarge' the prerogatives of the crown ? May we not, in tire same way of .reasoning, give up the Habeas Corpus act, and all the other privileges and immunities, which have been obtained to the people from the crown, from the date of Magna Charta to this very day? This surely ' has not been the good old way of reasoning in this place, and I presume, it will meet with due discouragement at this time. I hope we shall, on this and all other occasions, acquit ourselves like Britons, and not give up, in complaisance to any ministry, the smallest, much Jess the greatest and most valuable privilege of those we represent; and that we shall have the utmost caution in making any step, that may h^ve t]ie least tendency towards that slavery, from which, at the risk of a revolution, and the imineuse expence of blood and treasure, we have so lately rescued ourselves. I hope yet to live to see the day, when our present gracious sovereign king George the 1st, will have the glory to complete the entire restoring of our ancient constitution, to which his predecessor king William the 3d, hath iqade such a considerable advance; and that instead of triennial, we shall have annual new parliaments. Then indeed the British liberties, vfrill be fouuded on a rock, which the machina-, tions of the worst ministries will never be al>Le j to .prevail against; and the crown will be fre-, quently and faithfully informed of the senti-1 tnents of the people, and be thereby enabled to; preserve with them that confidence and good) correspondence, so .absolutely necessary fori the happiness of both: To this I may add, | .that the inconveniencies from triennial elec- i tions, will thereby be much more effectually redressed and cured than ever they will be, by, passing the bill before , ps into a law. Upon the whale therefore, I shall take leave to affirm, That we have at present an.uodisputable right j •to, triennial new parliaments, and -a very just: claim, for I know of no law that has deprived .us thereof, to annual elections. f

-But I have something to urge, -as to the! breach of our trust in the passing of this law; ! v»t is agreed pn all sides, That whatever the an-j cient constitution might be, vet we.were chosen ^vhen the law Tor Triennial Parliaments was,) ps it is still, in force; and that we were, and I could he, chosen only for the term of three years, j if hip majesty should think fit to continue us so j long; therefore to continue ourselves for a Jongqr terra, would be a poanifest deceiving of those who chose us, who expected, and could j not , but expect, at the end of three years to have i - the opportunity of.p. -new choice, and to alter .where they found themselves mistaken. It would also-be a very great injustice tP many I

thousands of others, who have a right to offer their service to iheir country, and who, for the honor of the nation, I am willing to hope, are ip all respects equally .qualified for the service with us, who have at present the honor to fill those seats.

If this bill were to enlarge only the continur ance of future parliaments, I should give my negative to it for the reasons I have already mentiqnec ), and yet in that case the electors would have a fair warning for what time they were to chuse, and those elected, would be truly and properly the representatives of the people; which I conceive cannot be said with truth of the present Parliament, if they should be continued beyond the three years: this, to me, is an insuperable objection against this part of the bill; for if we may add lour years to our present term, may we not add forty, may we not make ourselves perpetual-, or. even extinguish parliaments themselves ? Nay, what is it which we may not do, or, after this step, what is it which the people of Great Britain may nqt apprehend that we will do? Can we do any tiling much worse, than to subvert one of the three estates of the realm, and to substitute a new one in the place thereof, -and instead of ft House of Commons by the choice of the people, as it always has been, and ever ought to be, to establish a newkindof House of Commons, and till now unheard of, by act of Parliament ?

The great partiality which all parties in their turns'- have shewn in the determination of elections, has been too long the general complaint, and one of the greatest blemishes on the justice and conduct of the House of Common^; and it 19 certainly a crying wickedness, and a most dangerous .practice; therefore I am willing to hope that we shall not, by giving pur consent qnto the bill before us, ouMo all that ever was done of this kind by former parliaments. They have chosen only SO or 40 members for some particular places, which is a trifling peccadillo , to what is now attempted, I mean the causing of 538 at once, for the whole nqtion.

It has been said by some who have spoke in the-debate, ‘That we are chosen with full ‘ power to ^consent to sqch layvs as we ghall ‘judge for ithe benefit of the nation; that there

* are no restrictions or .limitations in our pow-‘ ers; and that therefore we may pass such new ‘ laws, or repeal such qld(ones, and the Triennial Act, as well as any other, as we shall ‘ think expedient; and that by a repeal of tb

I constitute a person-my attorney, with very large and-general powers for the term, of three years, and, no doubt, what he shall -dp ppr$uant u> tfiose powers, during that term, shall bind me, but what he shall afterwards do is , void; and it cannot be -said, that by the general words.of doing all act and acts in name, thgt ip ; i *

enabled to add fouf years more to the continuance of his power. I know there are great disparities between such powers, and those given by the people to their representatives in parliament: but yet I think-, that to the purpose I iiitend it, the parallel will hold'. I will readily agree, that the powers given by the people to their representatives are very large, but I can by no means go the length of some gentlemen, to think them absolutely unlimited, or that such ill use may not be made of this- power, as to amount to a forfeiture thereof.

Our histories are full of instances, and we have a very late one, that tings themselves may be guilty of such an abuse of their power, as to forfeit the same, and give'the people a right to a new choice, and it wilt not, it cannot be said, that the immediate'creatures ofthepeople, who have no pretence to power, hut by delegation front them, are more absolutely their masters, or more independent than the crown itself: pray consider, whether we can be guilty of a greater provocation to those w'e represent, than to deprive them for any time of being represented by their own choice, and to change the aucient third estate of the nation, into a new invented one, unknown to former ages; and whether they will think a little sophistry, and a few finesses of arguments, a sufficient reparation for an injury of so high a nature.

But I have a much stronger objection against this part of the bill, and cannot help being yet of opinion, that if it should go through all the forms of aaact of parliament, pass both Houses, and have the royal assent, that it will still remain a dead letter, and not obtain the force of a law; for I am warranted by one. of our greatest lawyers to affirm, ‘ that an act of parliament

* may be void in itselfand if there are any cases out of the reach of the legislature, this ivow before us must be admitted to be one; for what can be more against Common sense and reason than to be a fetode se, to destroy that constitution, or any essential part thereof, upon which our existence in our political capacity depends. I am also supported in this by the authority of learned divines; I shall mention but one, and I speak it for his honour, the present bishop of Bangor, who has Unanswerably made it evident, that all peoplie have natural

* fights, and that a free people have legal ones,

* which they may justly maintain, and which no

* legislative authority whatsoever can deprive

* them’ of.’ And can a free people* have a mote valuable right, than that of being fairly and frequently represented in parliament, by persons Of their own chtksink ? This surely is a right as valuable as liberty itself, beinj* absolutely necessary to the subsistence and contihuance

. thereof.

i*or the sake of thbsd gentlemen'Who seen! so very fond of the unlimited pbwer of parliaments, (and by which only they can Support the Validity Of such a law, as the bill before us is intended fb introduce) I shall mention some cases, to Which they themselves Will agree, that this un-. limited po wer doth hot, Caikiot extend. As for

instance, suppose, instead of the bill before us; we should pass a law, as was done in the reign, of Richard the 2nd.(the worst prince that ever sat upon the English throne) that the power of both Houses should' be vested in twelve great lords! or, as was done in the reign of Henry the 8th (the first proroguerof parliaments^ that the king’s proclamation, with the consent of the privy council, should have the force of law:‘ Or, as in 1641, that the parliament should not be dissolved or prorogued without their own consents:such laws as these, through oppression and violence, have been for some time submitted to; but surely no gentleman will say, that thdy ever were, or shotild they be now re-enacted, that they would be legally in force; for if so, the parliament of 1641 is still in being, for I never heard that they gave their consents to their own dissolution.

I will suppose one case more, which has never happened, and God forbid it ever should ! that an act of parliament should pass to vest the whole legislative authority in the single person of the prince, to cloath him with an absolute dictatorial power, to extinguish for the future both Houses of Parliament, and all other rights and privileges of the people, and to put all things hereafter intirely into the power, and to be disposed of at the will and pleasure of the prince. I am sure no true Briton will eter say, that such an act of parliament as thi3 would have the least validity or force, or be any wise bidding on the people; I am sure it would not, but instead thereof would, in due time, expose the authors of it to the vengeance of an injured nation; which I think is a full proof Of what I have affirmed, That the powers given by the people to their representatives, are not absolutely unlimited; nor the power of the parliament itself so omnipotent, as some are willing to suppose it: I therefore hope no' one will endeavour to support this bill by such arguments as Will equally support the cases I have mentioned, and lead us into the most dangerous' and unwarranted paths; and on this occasion 1 shall take leave to put gentlemen in mind, that France, Denmark, and Sweden were formerly free nations; and what their present situation is, and how they have been reduced thereto, is too well known to need to be repeated.

I have been often much surprised at the boldness of the Roman clergy, in introducing the doctrine of Transubstantiation; how they could have hoped to prevail with their good Subjects the laity, to believe so monstrous an absurdity, and did not rather dread that it would stagger their obedience, and occasion a general revolt. But our histories inform us, That this was done manage of the grossest ignorance, and of the greatest corruption of manners:A proper sea* soil for such an undertaking ! Accordingly the ” Popish clergy laid hold thereof, well knowing, that if they succeeded in this, their empire was secured, and implicit faith, without reserve’, would be thereby for ever established; it be- ing evident, That if this prodigious camel wak Once swallowed dowft, it was impossible after-

wards that any thing could stick. I cannot suppose, nay, it were monstrous to suppose, that our present virtuous and uncorrupt ministry, can, by the passing of this bill, have any design in view parallel to that of the Romish clergy, to plain thereby the way to some other laws, which may be thought necessary to the full establishment ot their power. No*certainly; they are too well satisfied of the uprightness of / their conduct, to stand in need of any indirect supports, and too penetrating, to think they could obtain them in a parliament, where the majority are so entirely independent of them, and who, in the present and former parliaments, have approved themselves champions for the liberties of their country:Besides, the preseut is so far from being an age of the grossest ignorance, that never was learning at so high a pitch, nor men arrived to so noble a w ay of free-thinking, that our motto may justly be, Noluraus jurare in verba magistriWe scorn the musty sayings of antiquity, and will in nothing be pinned down by the dictates of the learned, of this or of any other age; therefore it is impossible to suppose any such desigu in the bill before us, and yet I am very sorry it hath been attempted, and hope it will never pass, for the reasons I have already mentioned; and also lest it should give too great a handle to people without doors, to entertain untoward jealousies, and surmises, who may be apt to say, That those who can compliment a ministry with such a law, can never afterwards refuse them any thing.

I shall, on this occasion, put gentlemen in mind of the great debt with which the nation is incumbered; a burthen which is almost become insupportable, and ready to crush us into ruin; and yet, to our great misfortune, instead of diminishing it is daily increasing. I have long observed the fatal methods by which this mischief was brought upon us:I was indeed in great hopes, that the putting an eternal stop to the farther increase of our debt, and the settling the most proper measures for the lessening thereof, iu such proportions as in a reasonable time might entirely discharge the same, would have been the very first work of the present parliament, as it was the most valuable for the interest of the nation; but I am sorry to see it has hitherto given way to so many other, considerations, which, bow important soever, they may be thought, I will be bold to say, when compared to this, are hut like the tything of mint and cummin, to the weightier things of the law. Surely something must, and very soon too, be done in this matter; for I am persuaded no mau can be so wicked, as to entertain a thought of declaring the nation bankrupt, and paying off this debt with a spunge to the utter ruin of thousands of families; and as little can I suppose any man so stupid as to sleep securely, whilst the liberties of his country, and thereby his own, and the property of every single person in the nation, is in the most precarious situation; for, should we, loaded as we are, be engaged in a now war with any powerful enemy,

must we not either submit to all the unreasoqa-bie impositions of such an eneihy, or find some extraordinary means to support such an expensive war r Will it not therefore be our wisdom to put our affairs, as soon as possible, on such a foot as to make the second part of the dilemma practicable, without referring to so black an injustice, as that I have hinted at, either of spunging out all our past debts, or at least of borrowing the funds lor the use of the publje, during the continuance of such a war ? This surely is a subject of such importance, that it will justify the speaking of it, either seasonably or not; nay, I think it never ought to be out of our minds, till something very effectual be done therein; but I mention it chiefly at this time, to divert genilemen from passing the bill before us, and continuing the present parliament beyond the terra of three years; lest what shall be afterwards done in so great and so good a work by this parliament, if continued, may be liable to objection, from the doubts which the nation ' may have of the legality of such a parliament; and for the same purpose I shall observe, that we seem pinioned down for a long tract of years, and indeed for ever, in the methods we proceed in, to a Land Tax of two shillings in the pound, and to the Malt, to support such a fleet, and such guards and garrisons, as in the profoundest peace, I presume, will be always esteemed necessary. The ancient revenues of the crown, applicable to these purposes, have long since been mortgaged and sold away, and if our present unhappy divisions, should for some time require a greater force, for the quiet and security of the nation, even in times of peace, it is easy to compute how much higher the aforesaid taxes will rise.

Let gentlemen seriously consider, whether it will not greatly increase the uneasiness of the people, under such heavy burthens, if they think they are laid upon them by representatives whom they never chose. For my own part, I dread the consequence of such a law, as that which we are now about, and doubt it cannot be long supported in any other manner, than those extraordinary laws were for some time, which I have already mentioned; and I am persuaded, it is far from the design of any in this House, that this law, if it pass, should be supported in that way; and to make a standing army necessary only to support a standing parliament; for to me they seem to he sister twins, which can only live, and must die together.

I have now given my several reasons against this bill, which appear to me so strong, as would engage my negative to it, were it even in some measure conducive to the ends which are pretended: but much more when I am thoroughly convinced, that it is so far from promoting those ends, that if ever it pass into a law, it will have a tendency directly contrary.

It has been said, That three years is too

* short a time to effect any thing of great mo-

* ment for the service and benefit of the na-

* tion: That the first sessions is generally spent

* and wasted away in the determination of

858}, PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 1716.1 — m Route of Commons, [354

1 will agree, that much time is spent, not only in the first but in the second year, in the; determination of elections; but if these were all, without distinction, left to the Committee appointed for that, it would not make so great part of the business of the House, as it has of late years done: And if the right of election for the several cities and boroughs were unalterably fixed, at^d not changed from time to time, with respect to the petitioners and sitting members, the work, even of the Committee, would be greatly lessened:And I must say, That whenever gentlemen are in earnest disposed to cure this evil, it may be done to the honour and reputation of future parliaments, and to the saving nine parts in ten of that time, which has of late years been consumed in the business of elections; and therefore, surely this inconvenience can be no objection against Triennial parliaments, which is not owing to that, but to very different causes; and which cannot possibly be cured by the repeal the Triennial Act; but may be done, if not entirely, yet in a great measure, by proper provisions for that purpose.

As to the inconveniencies suggested to the . third sessions of parliament, from the near approach of a new choice: It will be much the same against the second sessions, in which something of business is admitted to be done; for I see but little difference between the influence which the prospect of a new choice will have at the end of one, or at the end of two years. The objection therefore, as to this purpose, is altogether trifling; but I will agree, that it has its weight, if it be urged for the long continuance; and greater still, if it be urged for the perpetuating the present parliament; for then indeed, gentlemen would be freed from all anxiety about a future election, and would be}' under no restraints, nor have any bias ou their minds from the sentiments of those who choset them; but surely it ought not to be thus, nor is this a compliment fit to be made to the electors of Great Britain, and is far from being a suitable return for the honour they have done us; and it is monstrous to suppose, that we should render ourselves disagreeable to the people, by a faithful discharge of our duty, and doing that which is best for the interest of the nation. Surely we ourselves, in the first part of this our first sessions, notwithstanding all the time spent in the determination of elections, have been able to find time to give all the necessary supplies for the service of the nation; but perhaps we have made some discoveries in this age unknown to former ones, we have a glimpse of some light undescribed before, yet it will still be true, that this light has sprung up but vety lately among us. And although this consideration cannot weaken the real strength of the argument, yet it lays it under the imputation of novelty, and will be a full justification of the integrity, if not of the sagacity, of those who shall persevere in their opposition to the bill.

As to the failure in the Triennial Act, of an* swering the expectations of the nation, it fins' been only asserted in general terms, and I c?s-

2 A

* elections; in the second something is done; but that the last sessibns is usually as much

* lost as the first, gentlemen’s minds running so much on the ensuing election, as to think of

* nothing else; and the fear also of disobliging

* their electors, on so near a view of a new

* choice, becomes a very great bias to their

* conduct in parliament, to the prejudice of the public service; so that in this short term of three years, there is little more than the work of one year done/

' I am not a little surprised, that such assertions as these should be made use of as arguments against Triennial Parliaments; because it seems to me to be protestatio contra /actum, As was said by a very great man of Dr. Sacheverel’s speech. It is evident, that the business of the public was carried ofr for some hundreds of years by annual Parliaments only, and our histories for that time do not acquaint us with any complaints made of the shortness of their duration:And is it not most notorious, that there never were such great things done by any parliament, as by those which have bebn holden since the Triennial Act ? Was ever a war so long and so successfully carried on before, and in which this nation bore so great a proportion of expence ? Were ever sums so amazingly great, given by any parliament or parliaments before, in the like compass of time, as has been done by these Triennial Parliaments ? I affirm, there has been more given by them for the supply of a single year, than was given in the whole reign of any of the predecessors of the late king William the third, and that the expence of the public service, since the Revolution, has amounted to more than it did from the first foundation of the English monarchy down to that time; and I will venture to add, that they were such supplies, as could have been faised only by parliaments of a short continuance; for it is not supposable, that the nation would have remained quiet under such heavy taxes, had the same been imposed by a long Pensionary Parliament, such as that of king Charles the second; but, when they were convinced of the absolute necessity of such supplies, from the concurring sentiments of frequent new parliaments, they were by this, and, by this method only, could have been disposed to the cheerful payment of the same; when this is seriously considered, ! am persuaded that no gentleman will say, That Triennial Parliaments are incapable of doing great things, when it is true beyond the possibility of contradiction, that they have actually done much greater things than were ever done by parliaments before: Let us but compute what was done by the long Pensionary Parliament of king Charles the second, and what has been done in a like number of years by Triennial Parliaments, and then the preference will be easily determined: And surely arguments from matters of fact, and long experience, ought to be of much greater weight than those, which depend only bn conjectural and ill-grounded surmises, and a fanciful way of reasoning.

v<>i. vn.

noteasily guess at what is particularly meant; for it has certainly answered all the ends which, from the preamble of the act, we can apprehend to have been expected by the makers thereof, or which indeed, in the nature of the thing, could have been expected from it4; for surely the grievance which nad been felt, of a Very long parliament, is thereby redressed, and the constitution of frequent new Parliaments, in part, retrieved, and brought nearer to what it anciently and originally was.

As to the increase of bribery and corruption in elections, since the Triennial Act, it is impossible it can be owing to that law, or that it would beany wise diminished by a repeal thereof; mild in fact, the increase of bribery and corruption in elections may have happened since that law, and yet be no wise a consequence thereof; it is contrary to common sense to Imagine, that those who would purchase their seats in parliament, would give more' for a triennial than for a septennial one, or for a continuance during life ? or that such electors, who will Sell theft* voices, have not arithmetic enough to proportion their prices, to the times they chuse their representatives for; therefore this objection Against the Triennial Act is certainly very frivolous, unless something much farther be intended, than I believe any Briton has yet the courage to speak out, t mean, unless it be ini-tended, before the expiration of the seven years, to add a farther term by another act, and so oh:then Indeed there is an effectual scop put to all future bribery and corruption in Elections, and the last election which the people had, was to be the last they ever were to have.

This bring* to my mind a very scandalous pamphlet, which came out a little before the election of thepresent parliament. I think the title of it is “ English Advice to the Freeholders of England. This uuthov takes great pains t6 divert the people of England from chusing a Certain party of men, whom he unjustly paints in very black colours; and, amongst others, there'is bn expression to this effect: Do not

* give your vote for one of these people, what-

* fiver they may offer you, for depend upon it, if

* there should be a majority of them in parlia-

* meat, it isthe last vote you will ever have the

* opportunity to give.* I am persuaded, it is for from the intentions of any gentleman here, to contribute to the credit 'and reputation of that author, by giving even a colour of probability to the truth 6f any of his predictions; and this I hope will also have some weight to pre-

> vent a repeal of the Triennial act; since that will have the air of the first bold step towards the fulfilling of this wicked prophecy; and the making use of the argument I have been endeavouring to explode, will nota little heighten the suspicion:it being evidently of no force, in any other view, but that of carrying the matter to the length which this author has foretold. But surely gentlemen need not thus hunt about either for the cause or the eure of bribery and corruption in elections.

Onjthelate happy Revolution, by which our

religion and liberties were preserved, we were unavoidably engaged in a very expensive war and 'had it been carried on by supplies within the year, as it is evident it might have been, our war and our taxes would have ended together; and we should have been then as able, when, justly provoked thereto, to begin the second war, as we were to undertake a first. But, un-. happily for England, this method was not purr sued, put instead thereof the nation was by. piecemeal exposed to sale; and execrable surely will their names be to latest posterity, who at first began, or have been since, the chief supporters of this accursed practice, by which one third part at least of the great sums given, have been lost to the service of the nation, which now remains loaded with a debt of fifty millions; besides, at least the sum of seventy millions, which ha3 been actually raised and paid. From hence it followed, that by the great burthens on our trade, a new spring of commerce more secure and beneficial having arisen, I mean the public funds, almost the whole numerous body of our wealthy English merchants, who were formerly the glory of our owir, and the envy of other nations, have thrown all their money into this new channel, and bare left the ancient trade, from which only the wealth of the nation can arise, to be carried on by men of small fortunes, who, trading only upon credit, are little more than factors for the manufacturers of England, who by this unnatural transmigration, arevnow become the merchants of the kingdom; and under these disadvantages a great part of our trade, which was formerly carried on with vigour by our own, is now fallen into the hands of foceign wealthy merchants, and I am afraid irreparably lost to us; the inevitable consequence of which hath been, ruifi to thousands and thousands of British families. And it is as evident, that by the long continuance of the land and malt taxes, and the high prices of all things, by the addition of new excises, the greater part of the middling gentry of the kingdom are half undone, and even our greatest commoners, and the nobility themselves, have very sensibly felt these pressures upon the public; and if the distress, more or less, has become almost universal, no wonder.if it has plained the way to bribery and corruption, and disposed those who had the opportunities of doing it, to partake of the general plunder, and to repair their own at the expence of the public losses.

The funds, as I am informed, produce above three millions yearly, towards the interest, and sinking of some part of the principal of our debit this great additional revenue, though the property of private persons, ' is entirely under the management of the officers of the crown, and thereby a dependance vastly greater, on a ministry, has been created, than ever was before, or could otherwise have been; and what influence this had on our elections throughout the whole kingdom, the acts of parliament which have been made to prevent the sqme, sufficiently proclaim: We have now aa army of civil

367] PARL. HISTORY, 2 Georg* I

officers, as dangerous as any military force, entirely at the devotion, of a ministry; and although we may run no risque from this, in the hands where bi9 majesty has .now placed the administration, yet we have formerly been, and may again be iri peril from this adventitious power, of the total I099 of our constitution.

The short of the case seems to me to be, That some ministers have by their conduct gone a

freat way to beggar the nation; and others ave corrupted thpse who have been so undone, and in this happy situation of men and things, the public ihonejr has been employed to corrupt electors, and-returning officers, and thereby have filled some parliaments with the creatures of a Ministry, and many have likewise expended vast sums of their own, when they saw it necessary, to get or secure a place; and by this means these parliaments have been filled with great numbers of mercenary troops, whose uames were scarce known in the counties where they were chosen, and without any family interests of their own, or the assistance of those who had; and if there has been any bribery on the parts of those who have opposed such men, as perhaps there may, it has been occasioned by the vile arts which have been putin practice against them: So I think I may truly affirm, That bribery and corruption, in elections, have not followed as any consequence of the Triennial act, but from causes widely different; and that the foundation thereof was at first laid, and has been since improved and carried on by wicked and designing ministers. As to the cure of this evil, I am afraid it cannot be thoroughly effected whilst the nation labours under the present heavy load of debt; and for' this, and many other reasons, it does not a little concern us, to make all the progress we possibly can in so great and so good a work, as1 is the discharge thereof.

As to the heats and animosities which are likewise charged to the account of the Triennial Act, and the burthen and grievance of frequent expensive elections, I shall readily agree, That the frequency of elections, is directly intended and designed by the Triennial Act, to prevent the mischievous consequence of long continued parliaments: but surely no one will say, That this, simply and abstractedly, is a burthen or grievance: and as to the great expence in elections, and the violent neats and animosities about them, they are not in the least owing to the Triennial Act, as I have already shewn: and I presume no gentleman would desire to extinguish the ancient English hospitality, for which the nation has been so long famed; nor can any man imagine it more possible to cure all heats and animosities in elections, than to prevent contentions about them, which the laudable ambition of serving the nation bath formerly kept tu>, and I hope it will do so again, without the help of any other motives; but besides, I am persuaded, that contentions arising from.so worthy a principle, and the old English hospitality, will do no harm. It is strange that

1716. — in the Howe of Common*. [$$8

any one gentleman can fancy, that the passing the bill before us into a )aw, would cooj pur beats, and settle us all in tranquillity; it seems to me to be calculated for the direct contrary -purposes, to blow up the flame, aiuji tp fill up the measure of the nation's discontents; for jt is impossible to conceive, that the electors of Great Britain, of whatever party or denaiqi-nation they may be, will not be highly incensed by such a law as this; and if they should universally turn their resentments against thosp,

« ho without their choice have made themselves the representatives of the people; I leaye ' gentlemen to judge, whether this would not be an animosity of a much more dangerous consequence than that which we arp pretending to extinguish by this bill.

It is also urged, That these frequent elections are a great encouragement to the idlp- \ ness and debauchery of the meanest and IpwfSt of the people; opportunities only to gratify the drunkenness and lewdneas of the mojb.

I am sorry that there are any excesses, to give foundation for this complaint; but surely the evil proceeds from tire same cause, and must be cured in the same way with those others which I have already taken notice of, to have been objected to the.Triennial act. And I ' mention this now, only to observe, what pretty epithets are given to the electors of .Great Britain. It was with concern that I heard them lately treated in this manner in another place, but could never have believed it possible to have heard any thing like .it hinted within these walls. How low and mean soever they may be, they are stjll the people of Great Britain, and we are one of the three estates of the realm, by a power derived and delegated from them. And are we then only the representatives of a lewd, drunken, debauched mob ?

To paint out the Commons of Great Britain, in such contemptible colours, is surely doiqg great dishonour to durselves, and is equally uo-grateful and unjust to them. I think we represent all the Commons of Great Britain, and surely amongst them there are many thousands every way as well qualified to fill these seats, as we who have now the honour to do it: and even as to those of an inferior rank, it must be owned that they are a brave and a gallant people; and when we compare them with those of other countries, we have reason to be in raptures with our own happy constitution, which has made such a difference between them and other meu: they are bred up from their cradles with deep impressions of liberty, and have their properties fenced in and secured bylaw; and by their representatives in parliament, they have the honour to share, even in the legislative authority; and it is this gives our people the spirit and resolution of the ancient •. Romans, by which our nation has obtained ' and preserved its great character in the world.

It is thus we ought to describe the»people of Great Britain, and we shall then only do diem the justice they deserve: but if, on the contrary, we shew an inclination to depreciate

PARL. HISTORY, 2 GeobgbI. 1716. — the Septennial Ml, fSBO

their value, and seem to be ashamed of those we represent; will it not, especially if we pass the bill how before us, give the strongest jealousy, that we intend to represeot them no more, but to set up for the, future a third estate entirely independent of them. And 'this jealousy wiil be still encreased, by what *:has been with too great freedom discoursed of '•without doors, That people must be governed by their fears, and surely so they must, if this bill pass; for I think it will be scarce possible afterwards to govern them by love. Unhappy Britain 1 to have brought forth children so ‘ unnatural, as to treat thee thus: for whatever may have been put in practice in former times, the doctrine of slavery was never so openly avowed before: what, govern a free people by their fears? monstrous expression ! and certainly formed design corresponding thereto, is an act of treachery, as foul and black as a Briton can be guilty of: an high crime and misdemeanor it certainly is, f will not call it high treason, because I know no law of the land which has yet declared it so.

The argument which I shall next take notice is that which seems to me to be mentioned as the chief inducement in the preamble of the bill, and which has been chiefly insisted upon by the gentlemen who have spoken for it; Because of the danger from the general discontents, and great disaffection of the people, which some gentlemen* are apprehensive, 'were a parliament now to be called, would produce a majority of very different sentiments from those who now compose it: others, who think better of the inclinations of the' people, believe that this wicked work could pot be accomplished without the help of foreign, money, to bribe and corrupt the electors of Great Britain; but upon the whole, are of opinion, that the thing would be effected, and that instead of the present excellent House of Commons, so devoted to the true interest of their country, and to the support of his majesty and the protestant succession, we should greatly risque the having such a parliament as would, be ready to call in the Pretender, and to deliver up their country to Popery and ar-*bitrary power; and therefore those who are against the bill, are charged with contributing to this design, although they are charitably believed no wise to intend the thing/’ And this I think is the full import of what has been . said by gentlemen on this head of .argument.

As to the danger which some gentlemen imagine of an iH parliament, were it now to be chosen, from the help of French money, it is, in ray opinion, a reproach to the present ministry, to fancy that they would be outdone, or outwitted by France in this, or in any other way; and J think that the defeating of such an attempt, is the only case in which a ministry might unblameably apply the public money, in the Business of elections: I wish it never ' had b$en, or may be done on any other occasion. But why do gentlemen believe that the recent of France will meddle in our elec-

tions:surely not long since, be had a mudh better opportunity to have distressed us, had he been so disposed. On other occasions we hear, I mean without doors, of the good understanding, between his majesty . and that prince; and that the Pretender will very soon be obliged to travel beyond the Alps: and this certainly is highly probable, if the Regent have any expectations of being himself one day king of France. I shall say .no more of this, and believe, those who made the objection, scarce expected that any one would have takeu so much notice of it.

As to the danger of an ill parliament, from the great disaffection of the people; this, I confess, is a most extraordinary and surprising argument, and such as I never thought 1 should have heard in this place; For it is an opeu declaration}! and acknowledgment, that the people of Great Britain are not truly represeuted . at this time; that the present House of Commons are the supporters of the liberties and true interests of the people, which the people themselves are endeavouring to destroy, and would effectually do so by a new choice:and therefore they are to be treated like indiscreet children, and not to have their frowardness humoured at the price of their undoing. This indeed is telling the people of Great Britain, in the plainest terms, that as they are not at present truly represented by those whom they did chuse, so for the future, they shall be represented without any choice at all. If this be the way to ingratiate with the people, what is it which can give them a disgust ? No, certainly this must make it absolutely necessary to govern them by their fears, and to take such measures as are proper for that purpose; a design so black, that I cannot suppose it has yet entered into the heart of any Briton.

It is amazing to hear this very suggestion, in my opinion far distant from the truth, not only on the present, but on other occasions, so frequently made use of as an argument; for were it really true, can it he any service to the public to be making daily and hourly proclamation thereof? For ban this be a proper and likely means to strengthen the hands of his majesty and his faithful subjects, or to weaken those of the Pretender, and his foreign and domestic friends, to publish to all the world (for what is said in this place can he a secret no where) that the disaffection to his majesty is very general, and the party of the Pretender so considerable in the nation, as to risque another rebellion in his favour, if they had the opportunity of assembling together in numbers on a new election, or any other opportunity equally propitious to their purpose: and if this

did not happen, that still there would be danger, that the majority on a new election, would be in the interest of the Pretender; and that this would not be less, perhaps might be more fatal, even than a rebellion. A bill founded on such surmises as these, and supported with* such arguments, is highly dangerous, and if it passes into a law, its title ought to be, ‘ An

t

3GV] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I

Act for the most effectual encouragement of the Pretender and his allies, to invade this kingdom; ’ in my conscience I believe it so, and so it will be tound if this bill should pass into a law.

I believe it will be admitted, that from the establishment of the succession, until it happily took place, a vast majority of the people expressed the greatest zeal for it, and satisfaction in it; that from the death of the queen to the arrival of his majesty, the nation was never known to be in a greater calm. That the parliament then in being, unanimously settled the civil list for the support of the dignity of the crown, and completed what was wanting for the supplies of the year; and whatever faults they might have been guilty of before, there was nothing now wanting in the expressing of their duty; and it has been surmised, that some persons whose zeal for his nhajesty cannot be suspected, were not a little apprehensive, that that parliament and the party of which their majority was composed, would to make amends for their past conduct, go too great lengths in their complaisance to the crown; and ihabfor this very reason it was dangerousfor the nation that his majesty ' should ever meet them; but whatever the reasons were, certain it is that his majesty saw them not. The joy on his majesty’s arrival was ns great and universal, as was ever known in Britain; and from hence I think.1 may fairly conclude, that if there be such a disaffection as as is suggested, since it was not before, it mu*-t have happened since his majesty’s arrival: and if this can be imagined possible, ifmust be then ‘ agreed, that such a general disaffection is an effect too considerable to be producedwithout any, or by a very slight cause; his majesty surely can be no wise the cause ofso surprising a change, as is surmised, in the inclination of his people; therefore, if there be such a disaffection, it can ' be only to the ministers, and produced from something really ill, or which is apprehended to be so, in their conduct. I am persuaded, that they themselves have too much modesty, not to agree, that it’is much more reasonable to suppose a disaffection to them, than to the person of the king; and I doubt not but this House will always distinguish, as they have hitherto done, between the sovereign and the ministers «f state.

But, in justice to the present ministry, we roust conclude, that the disaffection to them is occasioned only by imaginary, and not by any real evils done by them; and we have great reason to hope, that by their wise and prudent mariagement, they will be able in a very little . time, to undeceive a mistaken and deluded people, and thereby regain those affections, which, for the present, they apprehend to be lost to them. And if they should fail in this, I am persuaded, from their great zeal for the quiet of the king, and welfare of their country, from their known disinterestedness, their generous contempt of advantages to themselves, $nd from that ancient heroic Homan virtue, vrhich so visibly appears in every part of their i

1 Vl6* — m thi House of Common*. [502

condudt, that they themselves would become suppliant to his majesty for liberty to retire from the burthen of their trust, and to repose the same in such hands, as might put an end to the disaffections which are now complained of. And I am the more confirmed in this opinion, because I myself have heard some of the greatest men now in power, before they were sq, express themselves in such a manner, as left me no room to doubt of the sincerity of such a disposition. ’

There is yet one part of the objection which I have not touched upon, the danger which is apprehended of an invasion from abroad, and the insurrection at home, should a new parlia^ ment he called at this time, and this, I think, is the only thing which 1 have heard mentioned which has the colour of an argument for a longer continuance of the present parliament; but I believe when it is a little examined, it will appear to have the colour only, and to be vox &praetereanihil.’ I think I havealready made it evident that there is no such disaffection to his majesty, or his royal family, as is suggested, and if there be not, then the danger of any invasion or insurrection on that supposition, falls entirely to the ground. But even admitting the disaffection to be ds it is suggested, it is still agreed, that the whole nation is not disaffected, but only some part thereof; and that therefore the meeting together, on the occasion of elections (which are not made all on the same day ) would consist of mixt multitudes of well and of ill-affected persons, so that the former might balance the latter.

But admitting that not only the disaffection is, but that the calling of a new parliament at this time, would be, as the same have been represented, yet this will not prove that there is any necessity at this time for the passing the bill, which is the subject ofour presfent debate. I do most readily agree, that if this parliament were to expire in a very short time, and that the public meeting of the people would really be of such a dangerous consequence in the present juncture, as has been mentioned:that then absolute necessity, which always has been, and ever yvill be, a justification of ei-traordinary steps, would equally justify the prolongation for a time of the present parliament, in the manner now proposed; and no doubt but that the next succeeding parliament, convened in the usual legal manner, would approve and confirm what should be done in this, on so pressing an ocasion. But surely it will nowise follow, because this might be. done in a case of absolute necessity, that therefore it may or ought to be done, when there is no necessity at all. And it is evident, that there is no immediate necessity for the passing of this law, since, notwithstanding the length of the first, his majesty may still have two sessions more of this very parliament; and will it not be time enough to pass such a law m the. last sessions, ifit should then appear as necessary as it is now pretended to be ? And therefore admitting every thing which has been aUedged,

i

there is not the colour of a necessity for such a law at present: and this gives me strong suspicion) that there is a snake in the grass, and that we h^ve not yet beeu acquainted with the true reason of so unprecedented an attempt. Certainly no gentleman can be afraid of what every gentleman must wish, that before the end of another year, our ferment will subside, and the nation be restored to a perfect calm, which would entirely take away all pretences of doing what is now endeavoured:Or, that the unanimous voice of the electors of Great Britain against such a law, would, before another session, be found too strong to be resisted by their representatives, and that gentlemen, upon a more mature consideration, might come to think very differently of this matter from what they at present msy; and that therefore this 1 great master-piece must be struck off at one beat, and that now or never must be the word: Or may not others without doors be apt to suspect, that this law is really intended to encourage the. Pretender to invade, and his secret friends to shew themselves in public, by soothing them up in the hopes and belief of the greatness; of their numbers ; '1 and by leading them into that snare, have an opportunity of discovering and crushing them as thoroughly in England, as we baye lately done in Scotland:and thereby secure for ever the peace and tranquillity of the whole kingdom ? For it is impossible to imagine, that such encouragement yvould be given to the Pretender or his friends, as seems to be done by the preamble of this bill, and the debate of this day, if those who were for the bill were not entirely satisfied that a new rebellion, if it should happen, would be attended only with the consequences I have just now mentioned. How right a design of this kind may be in politics, I will not pretend to determine, but will veuture to affirm, that it is entirely inconsistent with the Christian religion, and the principles of humanity, common to all mankind.

But besides, I think an experiment of this kind much too dangerous to be tried:for when the fire is once kindled, no human wisdom can tell how much it may consume. And although we have happily suppressed the late unnatural rebellion, yet, I am persuaded, no wise man can wish, to serve any end whatever, 4o .pee the nation exposed again to the risque -of such another attempt, although it should be as-ill concerted at home, and as little supported from abroad, as the last seems to have been. $uch motives as these, therefore, can surely. _ prevail with no body, and yet I am not able to guess at those which should:And where no visible reason does appear, for so violent and needless a precipitation, there must, and will be great variety of conjectures at those which are not seen.

Another argument seems to have great weight with gentlemen for the passing of this bill; “ That it will encourage foreign princes end states to enter into alliances with us, when they see a certain fixed administration, on

which they may depend; for that at present they looked upon us to be in the nature of a triennial government, a new parliament being usually attended with a new ministry, and a new ministry with new measures." I believe that.this i* the first, and I hope it will be the last time that ever an argument of such a nature was advanced, or would have been endured in any English or British parliament. We have hitherto been able to form great alliances, and to do great things, on the foot of our ancient constitution; and are we now sunk to a condition so despicably low, as to he obliged to model it to the genius or humour of any of our neighbours ? Can a Briton bear this with patience ? Absolute monarchy, and despotic power, have no doubt, in some conjunctures, the advantage of our form of government; but shall we, for the sake thereof, give up the most valuable constitution upon earth, so adapted to the spirit of our people, and so well suited, in the general circumstances'of life, for the welfare and happiness of a free nation, and by which we have hitherto shone forth with a distinguishing lustre, from all other countries in the world? But as to the argument itself, why do gentlemen imagine, that Triennial Parliaments necessarily infer a Triennial Government? Surely the executive powef is intirely in the prince, there the laws of the land have placed it, and there I hope it will for ever remain: The power of peace, war, and alliances, ' are the undoubted prerogatives of the crown, and no parliament, I hope, will ever pretend to dispute the same. The stability therefore of our government, as it relates to foreign nations, depends intirely on the prince; and I believe our ancient allies never had, nor had reasons to have, a greater reliance on any British monarch, than on his present majesty, who so worthily fills the throne; and I hope that reliance will never be transferred from him to any ministry, supported by any parliament whatever; which, I think, would be of the most dangerous consequence to the royal dignity, the liberties of the people, and to the true interests of all our sincere foreign friends. But I am also at a loss to find out any necessary connexion between a new parliament and a new ministry, were there any weight in that objection; for are not the public employments in the disposal of the king, and whilst they are executed to his satisfaction, will be continued in the same hands? And when they are not, it is unfit they should. And whatever changes his majesty may at any time happen to make, I am persuaded they will be always such .as will be most for his own service, and the welfare of the kingdom, and I must declare the same opinion as to employments, as I have done with relation to seats in parliament; That there are great numbers. in Britain, every way as well qualified for them as the present possessors; and bow great soever my esteem may be for the present ministry, I cannot carry my compliment so far as to think, that the nation would be undone if they were laid aside. But

* 65] PAUL. HISTORY, 2 Gsosei I.

if by the passing of this law the present ministry should be effectually established, which is more than any man can pretend to prophesy, what encouragement could this in reality give to the forming of foreign alliances j when by the same law it is fully insinuated, and plainly admitted in the present debate, that theaffections of a very great part of the people are lost to this very ministry; for my own part, I think it is doing them die greatest wrong, and furnishing foreign princes and states w; ith the strongest arguments against entering into any alliance with us. For it is not their being supported by a majority of this House that will be any substantial encouragement, if it is believed that a majority of the nation are in very different sentiments.

Five hundred and fifty eight gentlemen of Britain, abstractly considered, were they all unanimous, bear but a small proportion to the numbers in the nation; but when they sit jvithin these walls, cloathed with the authority of the people, and- are thought to speak their sense, it is then indeed that they will have the full weight of the Commons of Great Britain. It is evident, that the present ministry and parliament were in being when the late rebellion broke out, and that notwithstanding all other proper measures, six thousand Dutch troops were thought necessary towards the suppressing thereof; they had not certainly been otherwise sent for, nor would any Briton have dared to have given such advice; what judgment then roust that, and other states and princes form from hence, of the situation of our affairs, especially when by this law we proclaim aloud that our beats and animosities do still continue, and that there arp still very danger bus dispositions towards a new rebellion; and if this be an encouragement to enter into, and depend upon our alliances, 1 know not what can be a proper discouragement.

I am therefore in hopes that this bill will not pass; instead of such extraordinary and unnatural projects as these, there are others that deserve our attention. I think it would be a design worthy of a British parliament, to concert and execute the most proper measures for the healing up of eur breaches, and uniting our mimds for the common interest and safety of the nation. The first step absolutely necessary towards this great work, seems to me to be, the forgetting all past party quarrels, and extinguishing for the future those odious names of distinction, which have been so long, and so Unhappily kept up. And I will venture to say that this expedient towards unanimity, is much more Christian, less dangerous, and, though difficult, yet much more practicable) than the extirpation or total suppression of either.of the contending parties, which the unthinking fu-rioso’sof both seem tobe too fond of.

I would not have gentlemen discouraged, in endeavouring what I recommend, from any difficulties which they may conceive therein; for surely there .was a lime, and not long since, when this blessed work could not have rais-

17 Id. — in the House of Commons* [§

carried; I hope it is stiff practicable, or else the nation will be soon undone; for we are snre, that a kingdom divided against itself will be brought to desolation. But as to the possibility of the thing, let nie put gentlemen in mind of the great heats and animosities, which were raised and continued, by the unexampled violences and cruelties of a long and bloody civil war; yet these were all appeased in the very beginning of the reign of king Charles the, 2nd, after his Restoration; the history of that time being sufficiently known, 1 need not repeat the measures which were then taken: certain it is, the nation enjoyed a calm for many years, our trade flourished, our wealth encreased, and we were both, in the literal and allegorical sense, a land flowing with milk and honey: and this I hope will be again our case. I would also recommend the payment of our public debts, or at least of putting them in % way of being discharged in some reasonable time; for till this is done, we are, in my opinion, in a state of the greatest insecurity; for what foreign prince or state, will either court the friendship, or dread the enmity of a bankrupt people? For though particular persons are really rich, the nation, whilst leaden with a debt of fifty millions, is undoubtedly very poor; and is it not a melancholy consideration, that when the individuals are very wealthy, that . yet the nation should be very weak; this is indeed a paradox; but greater still, that me& can be so infatuated, as to sleep secure under a government, which can scarce be said to be in a condition of giving them protection, and that too when it is in their own power to redress* the evil.

Before I sit down, I mast observe, that this, bill is brought in by no order of this House, nor Itas arose on any motion in it, but is a present sent us by the House of Peers. I do not say* that their lordships have not a right to send us-this or any other bill they please, a money biff-excepted; but since it chiefly, if not wholly, relates to our own, and the rights and privileges of those we represent, it would more naturally, in my opinion, have had its commencement here; and this consideration inclines me to believe, that it had not been easy to have found one among us, who would have been willing to have made himself remarkable, by being the first mover of so extraordinary a law, so likely, to disgust a vast majority of the people. But there are other reasons assigned, and pretty freely Talked of without doors, for beginning this bill in the House of Lords, that thereby time would be got, and proper arguments applied, to convince gentlemen of the necessity of this law, who, when it was first spoke ol, seemed to be very much prejudiced against it; and it is said, that there has been great pains taken for that purpose, and not without success. But it is said, that the main reason against beginning it here, was to take off that bias, which was apprehended might be upon the minds of gentlemen, from the doubtfulness of it# fate in another place; for though th *

Lords have, we have not an inheritance in our aeats, but depend for a continuance of them in future parliaments, on the good opinion of the electors of Great Britain; and to deprive thqm of the right of frequent elections, which they are entitled to by law, cannot be supposed a proper recommendation to their favour; and it was therefore convenient to remove this stum-

bling-block out of the way, that the advocates for the bill might argue and vote with greater assurance. But I hope the resolutions of this day will fully make appear, how false and groundless these and such like suggestions are, and that we cannot be deterred from a faithful discharge of the trust reposed in us, or influenced against it, by any motives or considerations whatsoever; and that those gentlemen particularly, who have sat long in parliament, and on all occasions have so worthily distinguished themselves, by being the greatest advocates for the rights and ^liberties of the people, will at this time shew the world, that they continue fixed and steady to the principles they have always professed. I therefore hope, that a law which even the worst ministry, in the worst of parliaments, never had the wickedness to attempt, will not actually be established under the best administration, and in the best parliament with which this nation was ever blessed.

These were the chief arguments that were urged on either side, for and against the Bill; and upon the whole matter it was resolved, by a majority of 284 against 162, that the Bill be •omraitted to a Committee of the whole House.

Petitions against the Septennial BilV\ April 25. Two Petitions against the said bill/ one from the borough of Horsham, the other from Westbury, were presented to the House and read:The last of them was ordered to lie on the table; but the House taking offence at an expression in that from Horsham, viz. “ That they looked upon it as an overturning of the constitution, and as an infringement of their liberties, ” rejected their petition.

Debate concerning a Clause for preventing Pensioners from sitting in .] After

this Mr. Lechmere moved, and the question was proposed, That it be an instruction to the committee of the whole House, to whom the said bill was committed, that <they have leave to receive a clause, to disable persons from being chose members of either Houses of Parliament, who have pensions during pleasure, or any number of years:but general Stanhope having represented, that such a clause would but clog the bill, and endanger its miscarriage, part of it being' derogatory to the privileges of the House of Lords; and that if any jealousy were entertained of the members of the House of Commons having pensions from the ciowo, a bill might be brought in to exclude them; the previous question being put, that the question be now put, it passed in the negative.

Then the House in a grand committee, of which Mr. Hampden was chairman, went through the bill, and directed it to be reported without any amendment; which being done, the House ordered it to be read the third time the next day. After this general Stanhope moved, and it was ordered accordingly, That leave be given to bring in a bill to disable any person from being chose a member of, or sitting and voting in, the House of Commons, who has any pension during pleasure, or forany number of years, from the crown; and that general

Debate in the Commons on the third reading of the Septennial Bill.]April 26. Two Petitions against the said bill, one from the borough of Caerdiffe, the other from Petersfreld, being presented to the House, and read, were ordered to lie upon the table. After which, the bill was read a third time, and upon Mr. Hampden’s motion, the question was put, That the bill do passj which occasioned a debate that lasted about two hours. Those who spoke against

* In my last I could only give you an account that the Septennial Bill was committed by a great majority; now I can acquaint you that yesterday it past the House of Commons by a majority of above two to one. The chief arguments used on the Whig Side, Were the resent situation of our affairs, an enemy at Qme in open rebellion not yet quite subdued, and a faction at home that encouraged riots and tumults, and would undoubtedly l&y bold of the opportunity that a new election offered them to stir up the people to not only riots but even a fresh Rebellion, that the Triennial Act never answered the ends at first proposed by it: that it served for no other end, but to keep alive our animosities which by the short intervals between elections had not time to cool; and that it debauched the common people’s morals and principles, and made them capable of the worst impressions, and ruined the gentry, who by the frequent returns of elections were put to great expences, and become slaves to the populace; that it hindered the due administration of justice, because the magistrates durst not punish many and great crimes, if committed by a voter, or for fear of disobliging one, and that at the present juncture when our foreign enemies only wanted a fit opportunity to invadeus anew, and put the Pretender again upon us, we ought to be upon our guard, and afford biin no occasion. Ttie Tories in their turn harangued on the topics of liberty, and said that frequent elections were the safety of the kingdom, by placing proper checks on the crown, minister, and even the House of Commons itself; that to repeal this bill was in effect to own the king could not trust his people; besides they argued it was unjust to continue themselves for any [longer time titan the people chose them for, they must then he esteemed not the people’s but their owd representatives, and what laws should be made by them after the time expired for which they were elected, must be null and void:this doughty argument was insisted on by almost every one, but particularly by sir Thomas Hamner and Lechmere, but this was both laughed at and refuted. ' For should that argument hold, then we were a people that had not a supreme power, and so could neither make or repeal any iaws at all, besides it took from us the natural laws of self defence and preservation in times of extreme danger:for the^same power that made that law must surely

the bill were Mr. Freeman, Mr. Hunger ford, Mr. Wykes, and lord Finch, who were severally answered by sir Richard Steele, Mr. Boscawen, sir William'Thompson, ' Mr. Erie, Mr. Tufneil, and sir John Brownlow. Mr. Freeman and Mr. Hunger ford having, among other things, insisted, that no satisfactory answer had yet been made, either as to the trust reposed in the Commons by their principals, or as to the repealing the Triennial act. Now

Mr. Tufneil, made thereupon the following speech:.

Mr. SpeakerI think the only question before us is, Whether the Triennial act, as it now stands, or as it is proposed to be altered by this bill, is likely to conduce most to the benefit of the public ? However, since in this debate there has been a good deal said of the constitution of parliaments, I most beg leave to mention a a word or two on that subject. That1 par *

liaments were anciently to be held annually, appears by two acts made, the one in the 4tn, the other in the S6th of Edward 3. But though they were to be held annually or oftener if occasion should be, in order to remedy the grievances of the people, yet I cannot find thai there ever was any time limited for elections:But as the crown had always the power of dissolving, so likewise of calling a parliament whenever'they thought fit. There was indeed a Triennial act made in the 16th of Charles 1, To prevent the inconveniences which may arise by the long intermission of Parliaments; and therefore it provided, ’That there should ‘ be a session once in three years; ’’but by no means limited any time for the duration of parliaments. This act was repealed in the 16th of Charles 2, because there were some provisions made in it, which were looked upon as a derogation to the rights of the crown. I believe I may venture to say, the first restriction which -

— ........ . -. ----*--a — a-

have an equal power of repealing it. This is the sum of both arguments, but in the debates on this subject, a good deal of warmth was shown by the Tories, and Snell so affronted the whole Scotch nation, in saying that no wonder tljose gentlemen were for giving up our liberties, who had given up those of their own nation, that he was forced to explain himself and ask pardon. Lord Finch abused both parliament and ministers, that this bill was calculated to servO the avarice of a few persons; and he termed the House of Commons a lick-spittle-parliament for coming into it. It must be owned the Whigs when it was first proposed, did not relish it at all, but these arguments and the necessity of the times converted them. And it is now evident that they should like what they have done the better, because there is not a Jacobite who d6es ndt rail aloud against it, which confesses a disappointment, and that we have broke their schemes. . Thus I have given you as full an account of this matter as I could in a letter.” Mr. Moyle to Horace Walpole* Coxe’s Walpole.

ever the crown lay under, as to the continuance of parliaments/was in the 6th of William and Mary. Then sprang up the Triennial law, which n the .subject of our present debate; and which, however well designed, was certainly an innovation, until then unheard of. So that what is now offered in this bill, is only, in some measure, to reinstate the crown in that power which it had always enjoyed. And I cannot but besur prised, that those gentlemen who have hitherto boasted themselves to bfe the zealous assertors of the prerogative of the crown, should of a sudden be so fond of a law which undoubtedly is a very great diminution of it. I hope I shall not be misunderstood, as if this were the only reason which induces me to approve of the present bill. No, though I shall always have a due regard to the prerogative, yet if I could imagine that this bill would prove the least detriment to the public, the least imfringement of the liberties of my fellow subjects, my vote should never flatter any crown, so far, as to revive such a prerogative.

The design of this bill is only to enlarge the time for the continuance of parliaments, by making them Septennial instead of Triennial. Of the law, as it now stands, we have already had the experience about 22 years; and what advantage have we gained ? Has it ever answered one single end for which it was intended ? On the contrary, has it not produced the most mischievous effects? What endless divisions has it created among neighbours, friends, nay, the nearest relations ? How has it ruined gentlemen’s estates, made them not only beggars, but slaves to.the very meatiest of the people ? What a scene of corruption has it every where introduced? How has it debauched the morals of the nation? Even the administration of provincial justice, which has always been esteemed the glory of our constitution, has been infected*: and I wish the infection may have reached no farther. These are some of the fatdl consequences we have already experienced by this Triennial Law: and those alone, m my humble opinion, would be suffi- cient reasons for the alteration of it. However, let us consider the present circumstances of our affairs. In order to it, let us a little look back to the original of our misfortunes: and are they not owing to that unreasonable cry of the danger of the churdh, under the specious pretence of supporting the church of England, though manifestly in favour of that of &ome ? That unhappy delusion, which has been so industriously, so maliciously spread, and so fatally indulged ! Let us consider that unnatural, unprovoked rebellion, which has so lately raged among us; and that sullen, groundless spirit of discontent which still lies murmuring in so many traiterous breasts. And notwithstanding that indifference, nay Contempt, with which I hear the argument of our alliances treated, by some ^gentlemen, I must own I cannot but think there ought to be a good deal of stress laid upon it: for how can we imagine,

. 1710. — on the Septennial Bill. [37S

that any foreign powers will readily enter into any "treaties with, us, for our advantage, without some security that they shall be made effectual, as long as our government is subject to such a fluctuation, and as it were Triennial ? Especially if it be considered in how shameful and how infamous a manner the grand alliance was broken; the faith of treaties violated; the credit of this nation sunk; its interests betrayed; our ancient and best allies abandoned and ill treated; new ones sought for, and caressed, with no other design, but to make us ✓a more easy prey to the Pretender? Nay, have we not too just ground to suspect that this cause has all along been underhand supported by these very allies, the old inveterate enemies of our constitution, who are always envious of our prosperity and only wait a fair opportunity to give us fresh disturbances? And could their vigilance, their artful management, and their treasure, joined with the unwearied endeavours of a restless faction at home, procure an election in their favour, "what would be the consequence, but to uuloose the doors of your prisons, no set traitors once more at the head of your affairs, to give them an opportunity of re-acting their former unfinished scenes of treachery, to make you a tributary 'province to France, and for ever complete the ruin of these kingdoms? To see the British honour thus prostituted, the once arbitress of Europe thus insulted; these things, I say, ought to raise in every British breast a just resentment of the injuries of his country. After all, I am sensible there have been several objections made against this bill, which carry an air of popularity with themj yet which, upon examination, must appearco be of no real weight. I shall take .notice of hut one or two of the most considerable, lest I should trespass too far on your indulgence. .It issaid, our electors chose us their representatives but for three years, and that we cannot prolong the term without betraying thattrust which they have reposed in us. In answer to which I must desire gentlemen to consider the nature off the writs of summons, and the return* to them:is it not to consult de rebus arduis regniP and that they should have ptenam et soffi-'* cientem potestatem pro se et comtnunitate

* comitatus praedicti, et praedictorum civium ‘ et burgorutn, divisim ah ipsis, ad faciendum ‘ quod de communi consilio ordinari oontigerit

* in preemissis nlta quod prodefectu hujusmodi ‘ potestatis negotia praedicta infecta non re-‘ maneant ?’ Nay, may not the same objection he made against repealing or altering any law in force at the time of an election, and consequently defeat the very end for which a parliament is chosen? And I should be glad to know what particular authority they were invested with, who made the Triennial Law, whiph was certainly a great alteration of the constitution ? There is another thing which I find is very much insisted on. and that is, supposing this bill were reasonable, yet why now Because it is uow there is the most occasion

370] PARL. HISTORY, 2 George I. 1116. — -Proceedings respecting Persons i nihe[3SO

for it. Are we not every day threatened with new insurrections, new invasions? And is it not the prospect of success at the next election, however ill-grounded, which still keeps alive the spirit of Jacobitisra ?

No wonder then there are such clamours raised without doors against this bill, by the enemies to Qur government, as well knowing that this must prove its best security; that it effectually defeat their measures; that it must strike at the very foundation of all their traiterous designs; and for ever blast the Pretender's hopes of rekindling the flames of rebellion. In short I am so entirely convinced not only of the reasonableness, but of the absolute necessity of ibis bill, in order to put an end to our unhappy divisions, to stop that raging deluge of corruption which is so universally spread throughout the whole nation, to make the crown sit easy on his majesty's head, and perpetuate the protestant succession in his royal family; and at the same time, that it is no ways prejudicial to the rights* and liberties of the subjects of Great Britain; that how ill soever a recommendation it may be to any future election, if I can have but the pleasure to see my country secured, to sec these blessings fixed upon a solid and lasting foundation, and if I can have but the honour to contribute the least share towards so glorious a work, my ambition will be sufficiently rewarded, though I should, by this day’s vote, for ever after be excluded a place in this House.

Lord Guernsey having in the course of this debate, asserted, That if a man did not fall into all the Measures of the ministry, and lap with them like the men of Gideon, he was immediately brow-beaten.

Mr. Boscawen answered, That that ho-

nourable member was of another opinion not many weeks before; so that what he now said must proceed either from resentment or disappointment.

Sir John Broionlozv said, That for his own part, he neither expected nor looked for a place: that he would not have been for this bill during the last ministry, because he was sure they would have made an ill use of it, but that he was for it now, because he was satisfied the present ministers would not abuse it.

Upon the whole matter the question being put. That the bill do pass, it was carried in the affirmative by 264 votes against 121; and Mr. Hampden was ordered to carry the bill back to the Lords.

Bill relating to High Treason thrown out by the Commons.1 May 2. The Lords having sent

down to the Commons a bill, intitled, 4 An act for allowing of counsel to all persons who shall be proceeded against iif parliament for any crimes of Treason, or Misprision of Treason ; ’ to which they desired the concurrence of the Commons, the said Bill was read the first time; and after some debate, the question being put, that it be read a second time, it passed in the negative. By this bill counsel for prisoners, in

cases of High Treason, were to be permitted to speak to matters of fact as well as points of law. i

The Aetfor restraining the King from going out of the Kingdom, repealed.] The king having resolved to visit his German dominions; and by the Act of Settlement his majesty being restrained from going out of the kingdom, without consent of parliament, a motion was made by sir John Cope, and seconded by Mr. Hampden, for bringing in a Bill to repeal that clause of the said Act; which bill was accordingly brought in nem. con. and past into a law. *

Proceedings respecting the unusual Liberty. allowed to Persons committed to the Custody of the Serjeant at Anns.] May 31. Mr. Choltnley reported from the committee, who were appointed by the House of Commons to inquire into the causes of the unusual liberty that has been allowed of late to Persons committed to. the Custody of the Serjeant at Arms; whereby. they have had opportunity to make their es-. capes, the matter, as it appeared to the Committee; which be read in his place, and after-

* Before the king went abroad, he made the following creations and promotions:Thomas, lord Coningsby, of the kingdom of Ireland, baron Coningsby, of Coningsby, in the county of Lincoln; Sir Richard Onslow, baron Onslow, of Onslow, in the county of Salop; Thomas Newport, baron of Torrin^ton, in the county of Devon; William Cadogan, baron of Reading, in the county of Berks; and sir Robert Marsham, baron of Romney, in the county of Kent; viscount Castleton in Ireland, viscount Castleton in England; sir Henry St. John, viscount Sr. John; George, lord New-burg, of Ireland, lord Newburg, of Anglesey, io Wales; Mr. Edgecombe was made one of the lords of the treasury; Mr. Methuen, one of his majesty’s principal secretaries of state; and Mr. Hampden, one of the tellers of the exchequer. Mr. baron Bury was declared lord chief-baron of the exchequer, in the room of sir Samuel Dodd.” Tindat.

“ When the motion was made by sir John Cope, to repeal the restricting clause, and seconded by Hampden, it passed unanimously, not a single member, amongst many who were dis-satisfied with the succession of the llanover line, venturing to make the slightest opposition to the repeal of a clause, which, however conformable to the hopes of the nation, could not but be considered as invidious and disgraceful to the new sovereign. The ministers were often obliged to make the most pressing remonstrances, as well to prevent the absence of the king, as to hasten his return; these remonstrances were often ineffectual, but always offensive; and Walpole, during the course of his administration, lamented an evil which he had in vain attempted to remedy, and which nothing hot the continuance of the restraining clause, or an absolute cession of the electorate could have prevented.” Coxe's Walpole.

“ Mr. Ryal further said, That sir John Parsons, alderman Sturt, and Mr. Fane, commissioners of the victualling, being ordered into custody; upon their petition to the House of Commons, leave was given them to be confined at their own houses, - which were within the bounds of the Victualling-office; and that Ryal lay at one of their houses every night, and, every morning, reported to the Serjeant, That he had seen his prisoners:and, except in the instances above-mentioned, he knew of no otlief enlargement to the confinement, of any other persons in custody.

“ Daniel Kingham said. He was a messen-

ger in the Convention Parliament, under Mr.' Topham; who kept his prisoners at home, and never let them go abroad without a messenger.

“ John Holingshead said, That he was a messenger under Mr. Serjeant Topham, about 27 years ago, when he lived in Bartlett’s Buildings: that Mr. Topham used to order his prisoners to a messenger’s house; but does not know he ever gave liberty for any to go abroad without a messenger1 to attend them; and cannot remember, that Mr. Topham ever kept any prisoners at his own house, in his time, except Mr. Grahroe and Burton.

“ John Cox said, He was a messenger under the late Serjeant Powel; and that Mr. Mason, now a member of this House, was committed to his custody; hut that he never went abroad without Cox to attend him.”

That Mr. Serjeant Wiburgh, being examined by the said Committee, touching the matters aforesaid, gave the following Answer; .viz.

“That Mr. Wm. Waller was, by this House, ordered into his custody, on the 24th of May 1714, for a breach of privilege, committed against Edward Vaughan, esq. and the said WaHer standing out in contempt of the House, upon fresh application, he was ordered into

custody the two succeeding sessions'of parliament; upon the last of which orders he surrendered himself, and has ever since been in town ready to appear when sent for; though

he never was confined to close custody:

“ That Mr. Walter Price, an attorney, gave the Serjeant his word for the said Wallers forthcoming; which was all the security the Serjeant had; who sent three several times into Wales to take him, and received, for charges and feet, about 60/. by way of composition; of which he might get about 20/. clear, above charges, ns he believes:

“ That Mr. Robert Parker was, upon the 4th of April 1715, ordered into custody for a breach of the privilege, against Mr. Cholmley; and he surrendered himself into custody of Tho, Gregory, one of the messengers; who, being a poor man, and no housekeeper, -put him iuto a friend’s house of his, whose name the Serjeant never knew; the said Gregory telling him, Thathis.prisoner should be forthcoming at any time, upon demand, as the housekeeper, the said Gregory’s friend, had promised him:that the serjeant received his caption fee of 3/. 6f. 8 d.; and was promised that it fehould be made up a greater sum, when the matter was over: and that this was all the security he had from Parker; who Jsrun away.

“ That on the 24th of May 1715, Joseph Calton mayor of Hertford, was ordered into custody for a breach of privilege; but the Serjeant did not send for him, by reason that Mr. Caesar and Mr. Gulston promised, that he should surrender himself; which he accordingly did in two or three days; and that be never kept him in custody; but Hollingshead the messenger had the care of him; though, by the Serjeant’s approbation, Calton was hot-kept in custody at Hollingshead’s house; nor does he know where he was kept for ten months after his commitment; but that Moffett one of his messengers, has now the care of him; but knpws not where be is kept: and the Serjeant said, he received S3 guineas upon Cal-ton’s account; and believes Holingshead had 10 guineas; and believes that the money was Mr. Casar’s; but gave a receipt in Calton’s name.

“ Robert Moffet, being examined, said, he never had Mr. Calton iu his custody. That the Serjeant being asked, what was become -of one Berrington, a printer, ordered into custody, the 1st of July 17t5; he said, that Berrington surrendered himself soon after the order, and was committed to the care of Moffet the messenger; but upon Mr. Gawen Mason’s promising, that he should be forthcoming, he gave him his liberty; and does - nut know where he now is:That he received 20 guineas of Berrington; but returned two guineas back again by reason of his poverty:Moffel said, the Serjeant gave Berrington leave to go home: and the Serjeant further said, That he was no housekeeper, and never kept in close confinement any persons committed to his custody.”

And a motion being made, and the questioo being proposed, “ That Tho. Wylierg, Serjeant at Arms, attending this House, having by no-jvarran table and corrupt practices, permitted divers persons, committed to his custody for notorious contempts of the Privileges of this House, - and other great offences, to have their liberty, and discharge, without any order of the House for such discharge, or any leave from the Speaker for such liberty, hath thereby rendered ineffectual the just' censures of this House, and has been guilty of a great breach of trust io the execution of his office; ”

And the previous question being put, . That that question be now put; it was resolved in the affirmative. Then the main question being put; it was resolved in the affirmative.

Ordered, That the further consideration of the .said li. port be adjourned until Tuesday, the 5th of J une.

June 5. The House proceeded to take into further consideration the Report from the said committee.

A Petition ofTho. Wiberg, Sergeant at arms, was presented to the House, and read; setting forth, “ That the Petitioner is most heartily sorry for having incurred the censure of this House, for having unwarrantably discharged some prisoners, committed to his custody; and permitted others to have their liberty, .without' pay authority for that purpose:which censure the petitioner doth most humbly acknowledge to be just, in the manner your honours have been pleased to pass the same; and in mitigation of his said offence, .humbly begs leave to . offer to your honours, That the lenity, which be was informed, his predecessors had used to. persons ordered into their custody, led him into these fatal errors; but the petitioner humbly assures your honours, that the just sense, he now hath of his said misbehaviour, hath wrought in him a most sincere resolution to behave him-, self as he ought for the future- and praying, That, in compassion to the petitioner’s circumstances, your honours will forbear any further resentment against him: and humbly begging pardon; and throws himself on the mercy and goodness of this honourable House.” — Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the table.

Ordered, 1. “ That Mr.William Waller, who was committed to the custody of the Serjeant at Arms for a breach of the privilege of this House, committed against Edward Vaughan, esq* a ‘member of this House, and who was unduly discharged out of custody by the said Serjeant, be committed a prisoner to the Gatehouse.

4. That Joseph Calton, mayor of Hertford, who was committed to the custody of the Serjeant at Amos, for a breach of the privilege of this House, in makmg an undue return of burgesses to serve in this present parliament for the borough of Hertford, and who was unduly discharged out of custody by the 9aid Serjeant, be committed s prisoner to the Gatehouse. 3. That E. Ber-rington, a Popish printer, who was committed to the custody of tie Serjeant at Arms, for printing a false, scandalous, and traiterous

The Commons? "Replication to the Earl of Strafford's Answer."] June 14. A message was sent from the Commons to the Lords, by Mr. Aislabie and others:with a Replication to the earl of Strafford’s Answer, put in to the Articles of Impeachment exhibited against him. (See p. 346 ; ) which was read as follows:

“ The Commons have considered the Answer of Thomas earl of Strafford, to the Ar-. tides of Impeachment exhibited against him -by the knights, citizens, and burgesses, in parliament assembled; and do aver' their Charge against the said Thomas earl of Strafford, for higb crimes and misdemeanors, to be true; and that the said earl is guilty of all and 'singular the Articles and Charges therein respectively contained, in such manner as he stands impeached; and that the Commons will be ready to prove their charge against him, at such convenient time as shall be appointed for that purpose.”

After Mr. Aislabie was' withdrawn, hie Lordship complained of the dilatoriness of the Commous ia bringing their Impeachment to an issue; as also that some of his accusers were to become his judges (meaning the lord Coningsby and sir Richard Onslow, two of the Committee of Secrecy, whose patents for a peerage were at that time passing) notwithstanding which, he said, he did not doubt but to make his innocency appear.

Protest against the Bi relating to the Forfeited Estates.] June 22. A hill from the, Commons, intitled, “ An act for appointing' Commissioners to enquire of the Estates of certain Traitors and of Popish Recusants, and of estates, givea to superstitious uses, in order to raise money out of them severally for the use of the public, ” was read the third time; and the question being put, That the Bill do pass, it was resolved in the affirmative by voices against 19. Whereupon the following Lords entered their Protest.

* “As for the Serjeant at Arms, out of compassion to his circumstances, no other punishment was passed upon him, than a private intimation of disposing of his place, on the purchase ' of which he bad kid out most of his fortune.” Political State.

"* Dissentient *

1. “ We conceive there is no necessity of this bill, because the ordinary forms of law will bring all the forfeitures of persons attainted into the exchequer much sooner, and with less expence to the public, than will be by this bill.

2. “ This Bill takes away the estates of persons though innocent, and subjects them to severe penalties not to be avoided by any method agreeable to reason and justice.

' .3. “ It vests all leases for years, of persons attainted, in the crown, from the 24th of June, -1715; whereas bylaw such leases are not forfeited but from the time of conviction; and this may overthrow the estates of innocent purchasers or mortgagees of such chattel leases, who may have bought and lent their money under the safe protection of the' law.

4. “ Because, by this hill, all debtors are obfiged to discover the debts they owe to any person, to the commissioners, by the 24th of November, 1716, under the penalty of forfeiting double the debt, in case the creditor happen to be attainted at any time before the 24th of June, 1718, although before the 24th of November 1716, be be neither accused nor so much as suspected; and, we conceive, no construction can be made of that clause, from any seeming inconsistency in it, to exempt it from the absurdity and injustice enacted by it.

5. “ Because any arguments drawn from any part of that clause, to make the rest of it good sense, were they just, yet we cannot agree to enact such a clause, which must either he not good sense or unjust.

6. “ Because every person who has any claim to, or interest in any other man's estate, mast make his claim before the commissioners, by June 1717, or else, if the person whose estate is subject to such claim, happens td.be attained by June, 1718, though till then he be never accused nor suspected, they are for ever barred; and no construction was endeavoured to be made of this clause to excuse it from the absurdity and injustice apparent in it.

7. “ The act for Irish forfeitures, being urged as a precedent for this bill, we conceive if that act were liable to the objections which this bill is, by having in it the like clauses, yet that is no good reason for the passing this; for if that parliament did a wrong and injustice, k is no argument for this parliament to do the same, •lest, in process of time repeated precedents of this kind may become too hard for reason and justice.

8. “ Because the general words in this bill. may give occasion to the commissioners to think, and the judges to construe, that they have power to summon peers, examine them jupon oath., and commit them to the'common gaol, which we conceive, was contrary to the' sense of the House, and.far from their intention to agree to.

The King's Speech at the Close of the Session.] June 26. The King went to the House of Peers, and the Commons attending, his majesty gave the royal assent to several public and private Bills; after which the Lord Chancellor read the following Speech delivered into his hands by his majesty from the throne:

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

I cannot put an end to this session, with* out expressing to you my satisfaction in the proceedings of this parliament. The wholesome and necessary laws which have been passed with so much steadiness, resolution, and unanimity, will, I trust in God, answer those good ends which, it is evident, you have had in view, by defeating the designs and reducing the spirit of our enemies, by encouraging our friends, and raising the credit and reputation <of the nation abroad to such a, degree, as that I may reap sonably expect the fruits of a settled government; especially being supported by a parliament zealous for the prosperity of their country, and the protestant interest of Europe;

“I am confident my conduct hitherto, in suppressing the rebellion and punishing those concerned in it, has been such as demonstrates, that 1 desire rather to lessen their numbers-by reclaiming them, than by making examples y but I am sorry to find that the numerous instances of mercy which I have shewn, have had n6 other effect thaa to encourage the faction of the Pretender, to renew their insults upon my authority, and the laws of the kingdom, and even to affect, with 'that greatest insolence, to distinguish themselves from my good and faithful subjects, acting with . such folly and madness, as if they intended to convince the world that they are not to be reduced to quiet and submission to my government, by such gentle methods as are most agreeable to my own inclinations.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons;

“ I return you, in particular, my thanks for the supplies you have given; which, although they fall short of the sums you found necessary, and have voted for the service of the whole year; yet, , by the encouragement you have given to make them effectual, may, I .hope, be so managed as to carry on the current service till another session of parliament.

“ My Lords and Gentlemen; u I atn very sensible there are matters of great' consequence still depending before you; but as they have hitherto been postponed, out of absolute necessity, by intervening affairs of a more pressing nature and of the most inune-

For oh the 29th of May (king Charles’s restoration) the Jacobite and Tory factions had distinguished themselves by wearing oaken boughs, and oq the 10th of Jane, the Pretender's birth day, by wearing white roses. But the spirit of disaffection shewed itself no where more openly5 than ht Oxford. On the 28th of May, the king’s birth day, all the windows that were illuminated there, were broken to pieces, as were alt the windows that were not illuminated the neYt d^y, being the anniversary of the restoration. To prevent the ill effects of this disaffection, soldiers were quartered there, who, at they were cheerfully and peaceably celebrating the prince Of Wales's birthday, were ibsuited by both the scholars and townsmen. Stones Were thrown into the windows of the Star-Inn, where the officers and some loyal, gentlemen were met, who were attacked by the disaffected party, when they Came out to drink the king’s and the royal family’s health at the bonfire. Provoked by these affronts, the soldiers broke - the windows of the disaffected, and committed Some other disorders. When the vice-chancellor and the mayor sent up their deposition! to court, they took no notice of the insults the Officers and soldiers had met with, but only of What the soldiers had done by way of reprisals, 'As this affair came before the .parliament, it will be mentioned more largely hereafter.

|t manifestly tends to set up the son against the lather, and to lay a lasting foundation of uneasiness and distraction among those who are best affected to the royal family: however they think themselves obliged to do his royal highness the justice to declare, that they neither hear, nor can perceive by any observations they have yet been able to make, that be has given the sraal-, lest encouragement to these Addresses. The Only remedy they can foresee for this and other growing evils is, what I bad the honour to mention to you in my last, that his paajesty should take the resolution of coming over to hold the parliament, and that it Should be known immediately he has such an intention." Coxe^s Walpole. Correspondence t Stephen Poyots to Secretary Stanhope.

<< Since I troubled you last, you had an account by another band of the apprehensions we had of Addresses, that were set on foot in several pans of the kingdom, which we heard tvo more of till yesterday, that Giles Erie (the duke of ArgyleY Erie) that sold t'other day, brought an Address to Mr. Methwyn from Gloucestershire. The Address is to the prince, and contains nothing in it that is very liable to objection; but Mr, Erie having no concern in that country, Mr. Methwyn told him, if any gentleman that was thought proper to deliver it, should desire it of him, he would not refuse to introduce him, which was all he could do. Mr. Erie then left the Address with him, but upon second thoughts came for it again in the afternoon, and said he would deliver it himself. It is observable though there is nothing very material in this Address, it comes from the county where au Address of another spiric was refused; and it seems since they could not have such a one as they wished, they would rather have such « one as the Whigs would sign, and could not be objected to, than have none at all, and this, is certainly meant as a forerunner toothers that are ready prepared, and will be of that ' Stile which yon were before acquainted with. We have reason to believe there are some more in other counties ready to be sent up, which may be in themselves not very significant, but ©nfy to introduce tbd humour of addressing, which when begun, if it meets with encouragement, you may depend upon it, will be followed in such a manner, as to compliment the prince at the expence of the king and his servants, for Chit was most certainly the first design, and can be of no other use. The Tories are waiting for ' the event, and hatter themselves with no small advantage from it."

" Since I wrote the first part of this, the Gloucestershire Address has been delivered, which his highness was prevailed upon to receive hr the best manner that could be wished. He told Mr. Erie that presented it, he was obliged to the gentlemen their zeal and tt-1

lessening, rather increased the number of the Jacobites; nor were they deterred from declaring themselves. Seditious sermons were preached, and libels against the government were published. By these means a spirit of mutiny and rebellion was kept up among the disorderly rabble. So great was the disaffection to the government at Oxford, that soldiers were quartered there, tokee^> the scholars and townsmen within bounds. Nor were these riotous pro* ceedings confined to England; for the Pretend* erY friends at Edinburgh had like to have freed a great number of lords and gentlemen imprisoned there, on account of theTebellioa.

“A.considerable change began now to bn made in the ministry. The earl of Sunderland, who had gone beyond sea, under pretence of travelling for his health, had taken the opportunity of waiting upon the king at Hanover, and by his intrigues with the German ministers there, particularly the barons Bothmar and Bernodorff, and Monsieur de Robethon, infused a jealousy into him of the lord Town* shend and Mr. Walpole; so that on the 11th of December, fcu express arrived in England from Hanover, and the next day it was publicly known, that lord Townshend was removed from his place of Secretary of State This was however softened with an account, that his lordship was to be advanced to the post of lord lieutenant of Ireland; the dnke ot Grafton, first lord-justice of that kingdom, being appointed colonel of the royal regiment of horse-guards, lately commanded by the duke of Argyle; and the earl of Galway, the other lord-justice of Ireland, being to enjoy an honourable pension during life. Two days after, the duke of Roxburgh was made secretary of state, and keeper of the king's signet in Scotland. The lord Poleworth was appointed lord clerk register in the room of the duke of Montrose, who was made keeper of the great seal, of Scotland. The duke of Kingston was ap* pointed keeper of the privy seal, and the earl of Sunderland sole treasurer of Ireland for life. In this disposition things remained till the king's return; and the lord Townshend's removal affected no more for the present than himself; though the divisions in the ministry seemed irreconcilable.

"The king, having finished all his affairs abroad, set out from Hanover the 19th of Ja-

tention, but desired he would let them know, that it was more agreeable to him to have aH things of this nature addressed to the king. It cost tome pains to bring his highness this temper, and will be a great disappointment te the managers of this affair. It is worth notice that Mr. Lefchmere was the penman of this Address. Lord Townshend gives you an account of this in his public dispatch, and bege you will give such a tnru to it in your answer, * as may please and encourage the prince in this instance of his duty and regard to the king."

unary, N-. S. and iotendays landed at Margate, feem whence he proceeded to London.

- «*It was expected the parliament woald lucre immediately met, but their meeting was pot off for some time, on account of a surprizing event. 0* the 39th of January, Mr. Secretary Stanhope communicated to the privy-couticd, the informations the king had received of a conspiracy, which had for some time been carried on to excite a new rebellion, and to favour a foreign invasion. The same night, major Smith, an Irish officer, who was no longer in the service, and who, that very evening, bad been playing at basset, at the apartments in St. James's, was seized at his lodgings; and, about twelve. o'clock, lieutenant colonel Blakeney, with a detachment of the foot-guards, secured the house of count .Gyllenburg, the Swedish, resident. Not long after-major-general Wade, attended by the colonel, went and knocked at the door of the Swedish minister, and being admitted, found him making up some dispatches. Having, in a few words, made him a compliment, and acquainted him with his commission to put a guard upon his person, and to secure his papers, he laid hold on such as were on the table, and demanded those that were in his scrutoire. Count Gyllenburg’s surprise raised in him an extraordinary emotion, which made, him expostulate with some warmth about the law of nations being violated in his person; hut, having somewhat recovered his temper, he desired leave to send for the marquis de Monteleone, the Spanish ambassador, that he might consult with him, how to act on such aa occasion. But general Wade, having positive orders not to let him speak with any person, could not grant his request. On the other hand, the count’s lady having refused the keys of the scrutoire upon pretence there was no thing in it hut linen and plate, the general caused it to be broke open; and, having found in it a great many papers, he sealed them all up, and left a strong guard upon the resident. The same morning Charles Cssar, formerly treasurer of the navy, and member of parliament for the borough of Hertford; and sir Jacob Bancks, formerly member of parliament for Minehead, were apprehended, upon suspicion of being in confederacy with count Gyllenburg.

* There were several conjectures as to the means of this important discovery. Some affirmed, the -king had- long before notice of the . design from France; others, that the discovery was owing to an intercepted letter^ from count Gyllenburg to the lord Duffiis, prisoner in the Tower: And others asserted, the lord Duffus accidentally revealed the conspiracy to an English lord, his fellow prisoner, who discovered it to the government, and thereby merited his pardon. Be this as it will, it is certain, that |he king and his ministers bad long before entertained suspicions of the count’s clandestine practices; which were not a little increased opon/che publication' of a libel about Septem- her 1710, inti tied/ ‘ An English Merchant's 1 Remarks upon a scandalous Jacobite Paper

* published in the Post-fiov, under the; name

* of, A Memorial presented' to the Chancery of

* Sweden, by the resident of Great Britain: '

Of which libel count Gyllenburg was suspected to be the author, as afterwards appeared by his letters. ‘

“ The securing the person and papers of a public minister, being an affair of an extraordinary nature, and some foreign ministers having expressed their resentments of it at* court, they were given to understand, that in a day or two they should be acquainted with the reasons for proceeding against the Swedish minister in such a manner. Accordingly, the secretaries of state, Mr. Stanhope and Mr. Metltuen? wrote a circular letter to the foreign ministers of their respective districts, who were pretty well reconciled to the proceedings of the court; only the marquis de Moateleone, the Spanish ambassador, said in his answer to Mr. Stan<-hope: That he was sorry no other way could be found out, for preserving the peace of his majesty’s dominions, without arresting the pen-son of a public minister, and seizing all hi* papers, which are the sacred repositories of the secrets of his master; and, in whatever manner these two facts may seem to be understood, they seem very sensibly to wound the law of nations. '

“ Not many days after the seizing of count Gyllenburg, baron Gortz, minister and favourite of the king of Sweden, was likewise secured in Guelderland, in' the following manner: Mr. Leathes, the British resident at the Hqgue, received the king’s orders to desire the regents of that state to consent to the seizing of baron Gortz, with his two secretaries, M. Stambke and M. Gustavus Gyllenburg, the baron having for some time been concerned in carrying on a correspondence, and concerting measures with the British rebels in France, aim with several persons in England, by means of count Gyllenburg, for raising a rebellion in England, to be supported by a foreign force. Mr. Leathes went immediately to Amsterdam, and disposed the magistrates of that place; to consent to the securing of baron Gortz, in case he should come thither from France: and returned back to the Hague. The same night baron Gortz arrived there, having heard at Calais, of count Gyllenburg’s being put under arrest, which prevented his going over to England, as be intended. He bad, on the 18th of February, a conference with the imperial mister, wherein he extolled the inclination of the king of Sweden to peace, and insisted on a resolution about his last propositions; but, the next day, he set out, a little before noon, in a post chaise, accompanied by general Ponia-toweski, having, as it is believed, had some notice, that orders were given to secure him, which indeed he narrowly escaped. For* upon Mr. Leathes application, the council of the States of Holland met, and passed a resolution' for seizing the baron and his secretaries; but, before it could be executed, the baron and M. Stambke were gone that morning for Amster-

-dam; So that only Mr: Qyltettbarg was then .take*. A party of bone wa» immediately 'sent after the other two, and Mr; Leaches followed them to Amsterdam, and, learning where -baron Gortz was lodged, he went, accompanied with the proper officers, ' tb the house of M. Tekaeo, a Swedish merchant, atd searched it; but the baron had left it some hours before. However, a hex was found, in which were twelve large packets of letters; and, informations being' given which way the bacon had taken, somegpersons were dispatched after bim, who seized him and Mr. Stambke at Arnbeim, by leave of- the magistrates of that place, as they were taking coach to go on from thence. Mr. Leathes, being returned to the Hague, waited on the ‘deputies of the province of Ouelderland, who thought fit to write a letter to the magistrates of Arnheim, ordering them to cause the-baton and M. Stambke to be kept in safe custody. On this occasion, all those of the regency, who were applied to, entered ' readily into the reasonableness of the king’s demand, and gave aU the assistance and dispatch, that- was consistent with the known forms of ‘proceeding in that conatry. It is observable, -that, whin bacon Gortz was seized, be- owned himself to have been the projector of the intended Invasion of Great ftritaih, by the king of fareden, and that be bed actually provided ten thousand armt, and other necessaries for this aarvioei valuing himself very much upon what he had done in this affair, as thinking it extra raaly for the interest ef his master, and a noble and glorious enterprise.’' *

SECOND SESSION op the FIFTH PARLIAMENT op GREAT BRITAIN..

The Rings Speech on opening the Session.*} .February 20, If If. This day the King came tothe House of Peers, and the Commons being bent for and attending, the Lord Chancellor read his majesty’s Speech as follows:

• “ My Lortls and Gentlemen;

' ' WI was in hopes that the success which it pleased God to jgive us, in defeating the late Rebellion, might have secured to the nation, peace, plenty, and tranquillity.

, “My endeavours have not been Wanting, during your recess, to improve the happy prospect Which Was in view, by entering into such negotiations as I judged most conducive to those good ends; and it is with pleasure I can acquaint you, that many defects in the Treaty of Utrecht, which very nearly affected the trade and even the security of these kingdoms, have been remedied by subsequent Conventions; the happy consequences of which have already very sensibly appeared by rhe flourishingcon-dition of our trade and credit.

“ By the Alliance lately concluded with France and the States General, we are soon to be eased of all future apprehensions from Dap kirk and Mardyke; the Pretender is ao-

* Tiiidal *

“ |t seemed reasonable to aspect, that audit a situation of affairs at home and abroad should have recovered, from their delusion, all.such of our subjects as had unhappily beta seduced by the craft and wickedness of desperate and ill-designing men, and thereby have afforded me the opportunity which I desired, of follow* ing the natural hent of my inclinations to lenity^ by opening this session with an. Act of Grace; hut such is the obstinate and inveterate raacout of a'faction amongst as, that.it hath-again prompted them to animate and stir' up foreign powers; to disturb the peace of their native -country: they will choose rather to make Brir, tain a scene of blood and confusion, and ter' venture even theputting this kingdom under* foreign yoke, tfoau give over their darling da* sign of imposing a Popish Pretender.

“ I have ordered to be laid before you qm pies of Letters which have .passed between the Swedish ministers on this occasion, which con? taia a certain account of a projected Invasion; and I promise myself, from your experienced seal and affection tomy person and government; that you will come to such resolutions as mill enable me, by the blessing of God, to defeat all the designs of oar enemies against us.

Speech, after which Mr. Secretary Stanhope Acquainted the House, That his majesty had commanded him to lay before the House, «* Copies of Letters which passed between count Gyllenburg, the barons Gortz, Sparr, and others, relating to the design of raising a Re- bellion in his majesty’s dominions, to be sup-ft ported by a force from Swedeu which he presented to the House accordingly, and the sard copies were read. They are too voluminous to he inserted at full length in this work; We shall therefore present the reader with the following faithful Abstract of the said Letters;

The first Letter is from baron Sparre, to count Gvllenburg, dated at Paris, September £5, 1716; in which the Baron acquaints the Count, That three days before, he was informed that he [count Gyllenburg] had entered upon business with some lords of the chief of the ‘Pretender’s party: that, they took it for granted, -he was authorised to do so, by the king-of Sweden; and, in a word, that he was inclined to believe, That his Swedish majesty would espouse the. interest* of that prince. In the first place, ” adds the baren, “ I will tell you that I shall be charmed with it; and then, Shat it is net from a motive of curiosity, that I ask, whether what I have heard be true; but, that 1 may co-operate with you, though indirectly, till I have powers like yours, with which, you know, we are obliged to proceed very cautiously, Do me the friendship to Jet me kno t, what there is in this matter, as soon gs possible. I flatter myself you will find your account in it.”

Hie next is a letter from count Gyllenburgh lo baron Gortz, dated London, Sept. 89, 0. S. Oct. 9, N; S. 17 ld» which, being very material, deserves to be inserted at length. In answer to your excellency's letter, ” says the Count, “ of the 22d past, 1 now do myself the honour to acquaint you, that every body here is Of opinion, that either France is extremely weak, or else, that the regent aimsfat the throne, and is desirous to purchase it of king George, at any rate; for otherwise, it is thought impossible, that France could condescend to make so ignominious a sacrifice, as she does, of a work'[Mardyke} which cost her so much, and for which the late king would have undergone a ten years war. People go so fat here, as to lay wagers, that the young king of France will be dispatched, before a certain time, to make room Tor his uncle. But, if the report, which is Current at present, proves true, that the young king is fallen ill of the small pox, it is very possible, that Providence may confound his vast projects, which among other things, tend to set up the court of Hanover to serve France, in our itead, as a balance against the power of t he emperor:and it was with this view, that France already offered, last spring, to consent to guaranty to the Hanoverians the possession of the duchy qfBiemen. If the emperor considers well the time, at which France takes these steps, and fengland is so forward to answer them, he will find {ha? hi^iast advantage oyer the Turks brqs begot

a jealousy in those two powers, And has made them bethink themselves, in good time, of securing one an other, mutually, against his power.

I know not with what design' It is done hut* the ministry at present, give out, that the peace of the north is actually in agitation, and that it will be concluded to the satisfaction of the king; of Sweden. My friends would persuade me, : that this is done, in order to quiet a little the' minds of those, whose eyes my paper (Remarks of an English Merchant, &c.) has opened. Be that as it will, I Can assure your excellency, that never any paper met with a more general' approbation; and, if I might venture to give my opinion, I should think it would not he improper to cause it to be printed in French’, in Dutch, and even in English, at the Hague.' Your excellency may be assured, that if these’ gentlemen here make any answer to it, I shall be ready to baffle them intirely, and that there is nothing in the world I should so tfiuch wish for. Whether they do this, or not, I intend to have several pieces ready against the meeting of the parliament, and to publish them by* a little at a time, the impatience of the people here not suffering them to read tong deductions; And, if I had wherewithal to defray' the* expence, I would cause some of them to be printed immediately, and the papers to be conveyed into such places, that it should uot be in the power of this court to hinder the Impression. The intimations, which have beeB made (tie, terminate in 'bringing in the Pretender; but, as I cat)not enter upon that affair, without an express order from the king, my master, I have avoided coming to the particulars. — Ten thousand men transported hither from Sweden, would do the business: and. I hew lieve, we shall not be at a loss for money. — I send you, inclosed, the translation of the Paper, which has been published here.”

Baron Gortz, in his Answer, ' dated at the Hague, Oct. 5-16, 1716, is of opinion, “ That >bitherto, they need not be much disturbed .about the treaty between France and Great Britain; ” and adds, 11 That the count's printed piece deserves the approbation it meets with:chat he has sent it to the king, and wilt take care to get translations of it into other languages printed. He desires to know the expence of printing the other pieces of the count’s composing:cautions him, not to make any mention, in Bis letters to the king, nor to his' correspondents in Sweden, of what has been insinuated to him about the Pretender; but that in the mean time, he will run no risque* in acquainting him with all the' particulars on that head; and that, above all, it will be necessary to make him cleaily under- stand, how ten thousand men might do the business; that is to say, what schemeiias been contrived, and what motive they propose to offer, to induce the king of Swedeu t enter into this affair.”

Count Gyllenburg, in-his Answer, dated at London, Oct. 12-23, 1716, tells baron Gortz, “T -say nothing to the ‘alliance lately made by

Go le

S99] FARL. HISTORY, 2 Geowe I. 1717. — Pcpert relating to the [400-

France. Last spring, France offered the Hanoverians their guaranty of the possession of Bremen, and I doubt not, but they hare now done it. How do we know, bdt this may produce good dispositions at Vienna towards us? It was in jest only, that count Volkra told M. Petkum, that his master would enter, into that alliance. I am very glad, that my pamphlet meets with your excellence’s approbation. I assure you, that to priut the pieces, that will be necessary, will cost'me, at least, sixty pounds. Printers roust be bribed to it, for they run great risques in printing any thing that displeases the government: but I will keep an exact account of every penny. I would begin with our Treaty, and make short remarks upon it. Afterwards, I will print extracts from the custom house, to show the little necessity there is of the trade to Petersburg!* and Riga, especially this year. Then I will come to the Hanover declaration of war, and will examine it, if it be necessary. > After that I will proceed to every one of our enemies and I doubt not, but to undeceive the nation.”

To this letter count Gyllenburg subjoins this remarkable postscript: “ Your excellency will have seen by my last to M. de Mullern, what I have written upon the subject in question. You will be pleased to send, or keep back that letter, just as you shall judge convenient. However, 1 beg you would be pleased to inform me which' you do. There is no medium; either Bremen, or the Hanoverians, must be sacrificed. The latter is not so difficult, considering the general discontent. Ten thousand men would be sufficient. The male-contents require but a body of regular troops to which they may join themselves. That body, being transported in the month of March, when the .easterly winds reign, and when it will not in the least be dreamt on, will cause a general revolt. We must also have arms for between 15 and 20,000 men, and as many accoutrements as can be got; for, as to horses, we shall have them here. Your excellency may easily judge of what advantage this will be to the king; and in my poor opinion, we have no other course to take, unless we are willing to give up every thing. My friends are not in town, but I shall speak with them some day next week:and then your excellency may expect their scheme:in the mean time, [should be of opinion, that if the business could be done, without making use of a great many English, there would be the less risque run; for 1 do not know, whether I ought to touch upon what the king must have further: for although they will endeavour to do everything that I ask, yet, as it must be by a contribution raised amongst a great many, ft may happen, that there may be a false brother. Our men once landed, I answer for the rest. In the meantime, ! beg you would remember what 1 had the honour to write to you, last

summer, concerning one N----. Nobody

knows the sea and the coasts better than he, and be is a brave and honest man. In short ft will be a glorious enterprise! which will put

an end to all our misfortunes, by ruining those who are the authors of them. As to what I have to say of the time, the sooner the better, ' after the trade of Gottenburg is ended, or be-, fore it begins.”

The next Letter is from count Gyllenburg, to his brother Gustavus Gyllenburg, secretary, to baron de Goriz, dated at London, October. 16-27, 1716; in which the postscript to baron Gortz, is only material, which is as follows I have since spoken with two of the principals, who have assured me, that the re shall be 60,000l. sterling, ready, as soon as I shall shew them a line from the king, with assurances under his own hand, that he will assist them. As for the scheme, 1 shall have it within a few days. One of them, who is the chief promoter of this affair, assured me, that we bad nothing to apprehend from the Regent on this occasion.”

By a Letter dated at the Hague, Novembers, 1716, M. Gustavus Gyllenburg acquaints -bis brother the count, that he has given baron Gortz his letter of the 16-27th of October, to read, as well as the note therein inclosed; to which he made him the following answer: “ Is is my repeated advice, to forbear speaking any at all of money; but to hear people only, so as to learn clearly what they are able and disposed to do, and to acquaint me with it, with* out opening yourself to them.”

The next Letter is from count Gyllenburg to bardn Gortz, dated at London, November 4, 1716, as follows; In answer to what your your excelleucy has done me the honour to write to me in the postscript to your letter of the 16-27ti> past, I grant tnere will be no harm in hearing the insinuations of this court, if they were made not only without my promising to make report of them to his majesty, but also my giving them hopes of his majesty’s being resolved to be reconciled to the Hanoverians, and to sacrifice Bremen to them for some equivalent on the part of the czar. But as, without that, they will make no overtures, for fear we should make use of them to increase still more the distrust, which is between the northern allies, and so make an advantage uf them; it if not in my power, to get any thing particular out of them; nor am I able to say of what service to us their assistance against the czar would be; but if I were to guess by their discourse, who have jbeen talking with me about it, as from themselves, though I easily perceived it was by order of the ministers, I should believe, that, if the preliminary concerning Bremen was settled, the English ministers would be very well pleased to retrieve the false step they have made, by talking loudly of the defensive treaty between us, and by persuading the nation to give us the succours therein stipulated, either in money or ships. I should fancy also, that we might come to an agreement in relation to what they ought to help us to take from . the czar, by way of reprizal for our losses it} Germany, On the other band, and if we dq

* 01] PA£L. HISTORY, 2 George

sot submit to them, . your excellency may be Assured; that, as well 10 justify their past action sj as to force us to a compliance, they will prevail upon the mercenary parliament, which' they have at present, to take vigorous resolutions, and even to declare war against us. This is what we must expect. The English ministers do not mince the matter; and they have already made it appear, that they will stick at nothing. Tt}ey are all furious persons.' Sunderland, who is, in a manner, at the head of affairs, and who has got all the interest be has with the king of England, by having consented to what has been done against us (being besides our enemy) is at present at Hanover, to take his instructions from the Germans, and your excellency may depend upon it, he will execute them with all the boldness [Effronterie] imaginable. Vnur excellency will therefore find, we ought to make use of this opportunity to enter into measures against people, who certainly will not do things by halves. We must either ruin them, or be undone ourselves, that is, if it be in their power to bring it to pass.

“ Postscript. My friends are now in town. An express, which came to them yesterday from the pretender, will put them in a better condition for forming a plan. To day they are going about it. There are only five or six of the most considerable persous consulted. They would know, in case we agree, whether the money must, be paid here or elsewhere, or if it most be sent over to Sweden. They have also asked me, if we had any occasion for sea-officers, for then they could furnish us with good ones." '

In another Letter, at London, November 13, 1716, count Gyllenburg made good his promise to baron Gortz, about giving him his sentiments About the business contained in the baron’s*lost postscript. “Thesum thereof" says the.count is what I have already hinted, that We must determine one way brother, and that very speedily. We have not, in my humble opinion, any time to lose in consultations. If we do not take advantage of their present animosity, it will cool; for the court, that is to say, the prince’s party, does all that is possible to gain them. With the most considerable, it would perhaps be necesary \ to go on roundly. Tjiey run the hazard of their

v lives and fortunes in declaring themselves, so

that they'wifl not speak but upon good security. And as to the people of.the second rank, be- aides that it would perhaps be dangerous so mud) as to hearken' to their proposals, these proposals of theirs are of so little consequence, and so confused, that we should not be able from them to form any idea of the affair. 1 should likewise be of opinion, that, till I receive fresh orders from 'your excellency^ the safest wav will be to avoid all conversations of that kind."

I. 1717 .--Invasion from. Sweden. [40$

which is as follows“ On Tuesday' last arrived here a letter from baron Sparre, importing, that be had hopes of succeeding in his solicitar tion, to have Mr. Leuch sent to the king. In his letter was inclosed one from the duke of Ormond to baron Gortz, in which the duke says, that the king his master had ordered him to let him [Gortz] know, that he expects shortly '» supply of money; that he will then remit sixty thousand pounds sterling to his Swedish majes- 1 ty, leaving the disposal of it to him; and that he begs him to look upon this as an earnest of his good will to him. The bearer of this letter added, that the remittances might be made either to —, or to — . M. Sparre has since told the baron, in confidence, of the men of war that we have brought in France, which will be ready and delivered. And that we are soliciting the court of France to send a person to the czar, to make advantage of the pacific disposition he is now in. But as this solicitation meets with many obstacles, and that, besides, France does not appear over forward to do any thing for us, unless it he in concert with England. M. Sparre takes notice, that my lord Mar has a cousin-german, named Erskine, with the czar, who, is physician and privy-counsellor to that

f>rince; which favourite has wrote letters to my. ord Mar, giving a very particular account of the czar, viz. That the -czar will not attempt any thing more against the king of Sweden; that he has fallen out with his allies; that he can never be friends with king George; ' that he hates him mortally; that he is sensible of the just cause of the Pretender; that he wishes for. nothing more than acon-juncture, in which he may be able to restore him to his dominions; that the czar, having the advantage wholly on his side, cannot make th* first step; but, if the king would make thf -least advance, there would be very soon an accommodation between them. . The Pretender has sent to desire baron Sparre to procure him leave to retire to Stockholm. M. Sparre hag returned answer, that, as this would be the . same thing as declaring war by sound of trumpet, it would absolutely spoil the business in hand."

In this Letter, M. Gostavus Gyllenburg inclosed the copy of another Letter, from barot> Gortz to baron Sparre, dated November \% 1716, as follows*: “ I still look upon the sending Mr. Lench as very uncertain, because,

I am persuaded, that France will not take any step, that may give the least suspicion, ok by which they may disgust England, before^.they have finished the treaty of alliance, that ^nqw depending. Yet methinks they might venture to intimate to the court of England, that they have a mind to send a person to the king, to sound his majesty’s intentions more thoroughly touching a reconciliation, and in order to qualify themselves the better to do gogd offices.

frankly, Sir, that, if toy scheme upon it be not approved and complied with, I cannot enter at ad into that affair. It is upon the foundation of my scheme, that I hare, actually opened the matter to' the king; and it would be directly to Spoil all to make me depart from ft. Any reasonable man will easily comprehend the impossibility, in this case, of settling treaty in form. Doubtless it would be running too great a hazard on both sides, to depend upop its being kept secret. The best way is, to prepare on each side the materials necessary for the work before us. When all is ready for execution, it win then be time enough to make treaties, if it be judged requisite. I do not know, even whether it would be right to do what is desired under the name of lending assistance; and I am very much inclined to think, that it would be better to avow openly our 6wn interest, and the concern we have for maintaining the English liberties. Your friends must place so much confidence m us, as to furnish us with what we want, to put ourselves into a condition of becoming useful to them. The sum required is not exorbitant: 300,000 crowns may satisfy us at present, for we want nothing but to augment our naval force at ^rottenburg. I do not see what hazards your friends can run in this. I will give them sufficient security; and, from the humour all the world knows the king to be of, they may very safely conclude, that if his majesty should not be ab Ie to satisfy this loan by a real assistance, he would do all he possibly could to reimburse our friends; the rather, because his majesty would not have it known, that he had touched iiny money for such a purpose as this is lent. These gentlemen might, however, the more to engage the king’s affection, give their offer the turn expressed in my scheme:though, for my part, I will not accept it, on any' Conditions, that may distinguish it from a common loan, But all depends upon their determining speedily, fend beginning forthwith, by furnishing the 900,000 crowns for the meti of war, without Which they roust not flatter themselves, that kny thing can be done. I am upon the scent of getting a fourth hundred thousand even in England. France cannot reproach us with this agreement, while ho treaty or convention can be produced to prove it. What I said above, of the cautioak behaviour of the court of France towards England, is no ffirabt applicable likewise to the negotiating of an accommodation with the czar. Ijt is probable, the court of France would not proceed in a negotiation of that kind, but by concert with England; and you will grant me, that this would not by any means suit our interest. This reflection leads itne into an opinion, that the canal of France is hot at present the most commodious for us. It may suffice therefore to have offered to make use of that canal without pressing the matter further. Nor can M. Lench be the manager of this negotiation. For goiru; to, and coming from Sweden, at the season of the year we are how in, requires time; and, if we comd to any

Agreement with the czar, we ought to condadfe it within three months at the very farthest. The canal of my ldrd Mar seems to be alike incori-venientand impracticable, because of the length of time, which that circulation of correspondence would unavoidably take Up, Yet I cannot but think, that, by the canal of the favourite physician, the good dispositions of the czar might be improved, if they are indeed such as have been represented. If the czar comes hither, and one can get a private conversation with the favourite, we might certainly carry things on far, supposing, as I said, that what the favourite has written be well founded.. In the mean while I am contriving some other way. If we fix upon a project, that is in uny‘tolerable degree proniising, I shall not be withheld by the difficulties and hardships of the voyage front being the bearer of it myself. If in the mean time your friends would enter into my schetrte, I should be the more sure of bringing the king to a thorough good liking of their business. But T will not venture to convey any thing of this to his majesty, otherwise than by word of mouth. It is satisfaction enough to me to know originally, that I am in no danger of giving of. fence to Sweden by the part I take upon me to> act in this affair. The fancy of the Pretender’s-retiring to Stockholm surprises me:It would be blazing abroad our secret intelligence by sound of trumpet.”

On the 12-23 of November, 1716, baron Gortz wrote from the Hague the following Letter to count Gyllenburg:“ I told you in my letter of Friday; that I deferred answering yours of the 13th, * which I am now going to do. You say, Sir, that as to the affair you are pressed about, it would be necessary to go roundly to work with the principals. I am intirely of the same opinion. The business then is to speak plainly. I believe, Sir, it will be thought a sufficient proof of our frankness, to declare as you may do, that nothing is more natural, nor more sweet, than to revenge an affront one -has received; but that in point of prudence, it ought to be maturely considered, whether the passion of revenge can produce the desired effect. If your people do but make the least reflection upon this rule, they will undoubtedly perceive, that it is intirely their business to make the success of the enterprize, which they desire, appear probable to us. After that, it will be likewise proper, ' that they should help us in settling the necessary points, that is, that they should assist us with money. As I run no risque, with you, Sir, I make no scruple tf telling you in confidence, that the business in hand has for some time been part of my . correspondence with ambassador Sparre. The principal members of the present court of Avignon, offer on the part of their master 60,0001. sterling, to engage the king’s affection. I remonstrated thereupon, that the delicacy of the conjuncture ought to caution us against closing too hastily with this offer, but that I proposed to treat upon the foot of a coawsofr

i

loan; pud that ia that case, being furnished with the king’s full power to negotiate money for his majesty’s services, I might accept it, giving. them assurances on'the lung’s part for repayment; that, if at the same time they i would communicate to me a plan of the prin-; . cipal affair, I would not fail to send it to the hiag; and that, in case his majesty should be; unwilling to enter into the design in question, : he would at least pique himself upon taking; pare, tbatthe sum, which 1 should have borrowed in his niune, should be punctually discharged; so that the lenders would run no risque of their money, hut that, on the contrary, they would have put it out to a good advantage, and that, in short, the offer being made upon the foot hofcrfemenuoned, without stipulating any other conditions than being reimbursed, the king might be more effectually wrought upon by that ma^c of their good will, than by directly soliciting the succours they desite. I added to all these intimations, that, incase the king relished the project of a Revolution 4» he brought about ia England, it might perhaps do better to give this enterprise the turn off its being intended to revenge the ua- worthy proceedings of the king3 of England,

' and to aaaintaia the English liberties. You

* have herewith, Sir, the copy of a pecuniary ^contract, which I have just bow settled with some private persons in this country. You will find by it, that there is a considerable

.advantage to be made, which it was necessary to allow to strangers, .since nobody in Sweden had courage enough for it. If your people had a mind to engage in it, abstractedly from the .grand affair, 1 would admit them forthwith as .far as the sum of 300,000 crowns. The king’s

• printed patent, whereof you have herewith a copy, sufficiently secures every individual person from ail frauds with regard to the States bonds, upon which the money is advanced, fiat they must determine speedily, or lay aside all hopes, as 1 have just now observed to ambassador Sparre, ia a postscript, which I communicate to you. if the thing be taken upon the foot beforementioned, it may go on; but otherwise nothing can be done. In a word,

we must have money, and, after that, we must. know what they are in a condition to do in .England, and what part they expect the king should take, to put this design into motion, nod to sopport it.”

In Answer to baron Gortr, count GyUen-burg wrote to /him the .following very remark- i able Letter, dated at London, Dec. 4, If 14: t “ As toon as I had received your excellency's (letter of the 8Srd past, I went to one of the . principals at his own house, with whom I have bad a long and intonate friendship.

I., 171.7.--Imofm/tOH Sweden, [4UG

went on currently: that baron Gortz had accepted our, offer, and had given positive assurances on the part of the king of Sweden, of his assistance. We have been pressed nn the affair of the money, and to form a scheme; and we have actually applied ourselves to both the one and the other. In the midstof all this, here are three posts arrived from Avignon, and no farther signs are shewn of so modi haste. This change has very much perplexed us, we not knowing to what to impute it, unless to the prince’s indisposition. But all is now become deer. They were too sure of their point at Avignon; they reckoned immediately on (be assistance of the king of Sweden; and now they are afraid, on one hand, of damping our courage, by owning frankly, that they had deceived themselves; and, bn the other, they dare not, upon an uncertainty, engage to supply them -with money, being sensible, it is the last that we shall give them *, if we should find it employed to any other purpose than we designed; and without direct assurances first given of our having the succours we need. You see, therefore continued be, of what consequence it is, if you wish us well, that you do not make known, to aay person, what 1 see our court of Avignon conceals with so much care. If you act otherwise, you will destroy the credit of the chevalier de St. George here, which perhaps will he of necessary use to you, had you will make has adherents your implacable enemies; for, if their design fail, they will be regardless, whether

• Sweden perishes or not; and yet you know, that it is they, who have hitherto defended your cause, as wdl in the country, as in the parliament of England, and -who have obliged your enemies to act with more caution and reserve, than they would otherwise hare done. You will still have occasion for their assistance in the next session of the parliament of England, -which your enemies are preparing to ine ease terribly against you, as well by pamphlets, which are already actually in the press, as by petitions of the merchants, who have lost their ships, and who now meet twice a week to consult. Now, {said he) to Teturo to baton Gortz’s letter, give me leave to tell you freely, that, if the question waf explicitly and simply, whether we should assist the king of Sweden, and me, con-seated, it might then be worth while to ask, what security we required, and what gain 'we insisted on ? But that is net the case at present, nor ever will be. For I must own to you-ingenuously, that there are very few araoaagst us, who have any concern for the interests of foreign princes, any longer than while they affect our own, sand that even very palpably:

‘ Manus nostras oculatae sunt; credunt qctod

* wdeat; Our eyes are incur bands; what they 1 see we believe.’ So that for you to flatter yourselves, that, out of respect or friendship, we should part with our money to any whatsoever, would be to know codling of us. You can nevfer alter our 'minds on that article; -so you mist just takers as ore are. As for gain, can we hope for greater iu any -country, than

-what wehave at home, without risqning our money? Do not we make seven or eight per, •cent, by the public funds; and this upon the cecority of the parliament of England, and are paid punctually every quarter? That, this question being utterly unseasonable, it is necessary .to form another; and let that be, whether we are witling, by a pecuniary subsidy, to merit the assistance of the king of Sweden ? To that I answer roundly, let us but be assured on the part of his majesty, upon, whose bare promise we will rely, more than on all the securities and . engagements of others: I say, let us only be assured, that by our money we shall merit his help, and actually have it. After this, let us but know what you would have us to do, and we will make such efforts, that his majesty shall not repent of giving his royal word to assist us. But, Sir, (added he) What must we think, when,

- after a negotiation of three months or more, we are yet in uncertaintly upon what ought to be the chief spring of all our undertakings, and are to merit by our money, not the help weask, but barely an answer, whether we shall obtain it or not? How can we run into expence, expose our friends, and, in short, endanger our fortunes and lives, when perhaps his majesty’s refusal may stop us short; subject, among other things, to the fear -of being betrayed by those, who,

seeing the ill success of our projects, and that there is nothing to be hoped for more on our side, may endeavour to make their fortune, by striking in with our enemies, and sacrificing us. — Let u&examine all this, and yourself will acknowledge, we should hazard too much in following those, who leave in such uncertainty; but, on the other hand, what does the king of Sweden risque ? Is not our government his enemies in every respect; and will it not assist them more this ensuing year? What can be . said against him, if, after the example of Scipio, he carries the war into their country, who have been desirous, and are still so, to carry it into his ? This diversion will be so much the greater, as it will he unexpected; and there is the more reason to hope for success, because the whole country is disaffected. It is also probable, that half the army will be disbanded by the parliament of England; and it is certain great part of that army will desert on the approach of a . sufficient body of troops. — But suppose this enterprise should not succeed, would this government be more bent upon the intire ruin of the king of Sweden than it was before ? And, when king George’s desire to have the country of Bremen is satisfied^ will our government be (ess solicitous by what means to prevent the czar’s . aggrandizing himself? Let me beg you (said he)

: to represent all this to baron Gqrtz; and I am eure he will change his opinion:and that he will not let slip, by chaffering, an opportunity . so beneficial for the king of Sweden, and se glorious for himself. Tell him likewise, if you please, that there is nothing more proper than what he demands as to a scheme^ and the oaeaas of supporting the affair.

But I am much afraid, that the rest of my party will take this affair in quite another light; that is to say, that they will imagine his Swedish majesty, Having not given any promise to our Chevalier, nor declared for him, will make no other pse of this enterprize, than only to compass his own designs, exclusive of the Chevalier, and to oblige king George to' come . .to better terms. But in this he will find himself deceived; for, the greatest part of the nation being at present inflamed with Jacobitism, and set a longing for the return of him, whom they believe their lawful sovereign, they will not join any person, who does not declare openly for him:on the contrary, perceiving it is only a foreign quarrel, which draws the king of Sweden hither, vexed to see their expectations frustrated, and not knowing how far his majesty’s resentments may go, and who will be exposed to his vengeance, or who be exempt from it, they will fall into the common humour of the nation, which is to unite all, notwithstanding their past feuds, against a foreign power. — This is so true (continued he,) that if the chevalier de St. George had not an English father, and been born in England, all his pretensions would avail him nothing with the common people; who, when the contest shall be only between foreigner and foreigner, will certainly declare for him in possession, without much regard to the justice of the cause. — For what-remains (added he) I intirely agree, that the maintaining of the church of England ought to be one topic in the king of Sweden’s manifesto. This is the more necessary, because it would serve to settle the minds of such as are disturb^ about the Chevalier’s religion. His majesty likewise would act iu his known character, which is to be, on all occasions, -solicitous for the welfare of the Protestant religion. — This, Sir, is what was most material in my' conversation with my friend, who, I assure your excellency, is a man of solid judgment, and so well informed of what passes at Avignon, that he told me a long time ago what was negotiated there on our part, though I- took no' notice of it, while I saw nothing particular about it, either in. yobr- excel- lency’s letters, or in those of Monsieur Sparre. He even told me, that a certain relation of my lord Mar’s Was. confident of doing us very good offices with the czar; and that it had been intimated to. baron Sparre. But, being tender of intruding into the provinces of others, . I reckoned your excellency would be better informed of this the direct way.”

the following Letter, dated at the Hague, December 11, 1716, to count Gyllenburg: “ I have received your agreeable letter of the 4th instant. I shall have the honour to answer the contents of it; that the stronger the reasons are, which are alledged to make us enter into the affair you know of, the more should people be persuaded of the true desire, that we have to undertake the thing. It is superfluous to Suggest motives to us, and we have no need of a spur. As I run no risque with you, Sir, I will freely tell you, that, even before my departure from Sweden, we were already, on our side, disposed to this expedition. It is easy to believe, that those dispositions are since increased in proportion as the animosity of the court, where you are, hath continued increasing. There is therefore now uo other question, but of the means to satisfy our just desire of. revenge. We have in Sweden troops more than enough for that purpose; but what sus-. pends our entering upon action is; that, First, we have not - the ships necessary as well for transporting the troops, as for the convoy itself. Secondly, we do not know how it is proposed :to maintain the troops when they shall be arrived at the piace intended. Thirdly, horses must forthwith be found to mount the cavalry. It is well known, that when one enters into an open country, thaffrst impression must be made by the cavalry. Fourthly, we must know the number of troops, that is thought requisite for this expedition, in order to regulate thereby the armament of the ships. — It is true, Sir, that, for several months last past, we have had 6oroe preliminary negotiation upon these matters with the court of Avignon. They have declared themselves very well satisfied with the manner, in w.hich we have spoken to them, and have promised not only to give the necessary explanations upon the advances of money proposed, 'but also to furnish instantly-wherewithal to prepare on our side, during this winter, every thing, that concerns the first step; being themselves of opinion, that, if any thing be intended to be done, it must be entered upon immediately after the obstacles, which a hard winter might bring to navigation, are removed; but hitherto all this lias ended only in vain hopes. However, I have nut, on my part, lost aoy time for this enterprize. 1 have bestirred myself to find out men of war: I have actually found out some, and have even made ' bargains for purchasing six of between sixty and seventy guns, all armed and rigged and they are to be delivered at Gottenburg in the beginning of the month of March. The advance of money, which I asked from the court of Avignon, was only designed for the purchase of those ships; and the sum did not exceed 60,000l. If I have proposed the expedient 6f furnishing us with this money upon the foot of a common loan, it was only done, Sir, with a view, the better to secure those, that were concerned on both sides, from the danger of a discovery, and those, that should give the money, against the accidents, in case any such should

be, that might render the design impracticable. It is also the fear either of some treachery or disappointment, which cannot be foreseen, that will hinder us from declaring before we come to the place, where we are to shew ourselves. Our friends will have nothing to object against this precaution, if they will but consider, that, if we throw off the mask too soon, and should afterwards miss our blow, we should give the English ministers a very good argument to Carry the nation into a war against us, into which they would not have a great' deal of trouble to draw Holland also. This is a risque of the last consequence; and would they have us run into it, Sir, for a trifle ? I do not know how else to stile the money-business in question. — The naval armament at Gottenburgh cannot be useful to us, unless for the design, which they propose to us; and the money we ask will not be sufficient even for that armament. — As to the rest, however just and solid I allow your friend’s reasoniugin other matters, yet I cannot reconcile the opinion, which your friend seems to have of the good faith of the king, and his interest, with the fear, which is nevertheless shewn, that we have no other end than to procure for ourselves the restitution of the duchy of Bremen. — Pray, Sir, which way can the king of Swedeu better secure himself the recovery and possession of his said dueby, than by reducing king George to be nothing more than an elector of the empire ? By which means the king of Sweden will make himself be courted by the house of Lunenburg, as in former times. Can good faith and a man’s word be put in the scale against so solid and so evident a reason, after we have experienced how little account ought to be made of a security founded in words or in treaties ? To be short. Sir, the question is with us an affair already decided; nothing remains but to consider the means. — As I understand the matter, those that shall furnish the money, will be in no danger; they may give it under the name of Dutch merchants, and under pretext of the great gain that is to be made in dealing with me. The better to colour the thing, * they may even. give commission to antae English merchants, to make an agreement with me upon the foot of the contract, which I have had the honour to communicate to you. After this there would remain no other risque than that of losing the. money, ip case the design should not be executed:but, if they had the least confidence in the word of the king, this scruple would vanish immediately. His majesty piques himself too much upon performing his engagements, to leave any room to mistrust him. We have fresh proofs of this, notwithstanding the vast ex- pence that we are obliged to bear; his majesty would have the pretensions of Mr. Cook, and the other merchants in France, touching the money advanced' to him in Turkey, satisfied, and I have actually paid those creditors. — To conclude, 1 must tell you again, Sir, that they must come to a resolution speedily, or think no more of the affair for all the next year. — It

would «lao benecessary, that those, who mean us well, should labour to get half the troops that are now oa Foot in England, broken, and; 4o hinder any naval armament till the month of May. — It concerns us also to know, our direction, what number of regular troops will remain, after they shall have got one half of them disbanded. 1 reckon, that we might employ from ten to twelve thousand Swedes in this expedition; amongst whom there should be '

4,0001., horse. — When thingB shall be put upon the foot abovementioned, I intend to go into Sweden myself, to posh on the execution; for 1 do not like to rely on the care of others in > such a particular. I bad also rather concert this affair directly, and with you, than by the other way, which 1 think too long. My lord’s v .relation hath indeed sent %vord, that the czar has some dispositions to peace, which we will not fail to make advantage of, that we may be ' in. a condition the better to push on the affair , in question. The czar is to be here very speedily. If it could be ordered, that the spid relation of nay lord Mar should speak to me, I should quickly perceive what might be done there. .You will easily judge, Sir, that an agreement ' with die czar would give great weight to the other affair.”

. In answer to this Letter, coant Gyllenburg, on the 18th of December, N. $. 1716, wrote Cite following to baron Gortz: “ I had received, .two days ago, the letter your excellency did me the favour to write me of the 11th, and I •have not deferred the execution of your orders .one moment. I hope to be able to give you . ma account of them by the next mail. Ia the mean time, I shall have the honour to answer to your excellency’s postscript, that 1 shall not fail to govern myself as you there direct. If 1 have hitherto done otherwise, it has been, that J[might not be accused of not representing matters as they were on. one side and the -other, leaving it afterwards to our ministers to rtnake choice of that, which they thought most proper. Your excellency, according to your wonted goodness, will forgive me, however, for saying, that in my opinion, whatever resolution we take, it would, notwithstanding, be .well to keep the people here in good humour; that is, that we should seem not intirely to reject their proposals, or otherwise they will be prying into the motives, which render us so intractable, and will perhaps discover the true one, ia which case they will cause it to miscarry. Besides, a little hopes would make them put off longer, the pushing the affair in parliament; and I think that is what your excellency seems to desire. Methinks, tt> this end, it would be necessary that your excellency should write Petkum an answer, who complains of having received none to his letters, to shew your acknowledgment of the pains be has taken, and to desire him to go on, in order to .keep the ministers in the same good way, till your excellency has received an answer to the, :aoooomtft which you have given his majesty of

the whole affair; and than we may act with more vigour. As Petkum generally shews ail his letters to Townsheod and Bolhtnar, I fancy they, will thereby be easily .persuaded tq believe what they wish. If this letter comes before the arrival of king George, it will perhaps prevent the impression, which the Germans and Sunderland will be apt to make with their usual violence at their first coming over.”

The two next Letters relate principally to bills of exchange, shipping, corn, salt, &c. for Sweden; but in one from-oount Gyllenburg to baron Gortz, dated at London, December SO, 1716, he writes as follows: “ I am once more obliged to defer the departure of my express till Friday, one of the principal of our friends being not yet returned to Loodon; but he will he here tomorrow. I have the letters ready for the physician, but dare not venture them by the post. While I am waiting for the principal ef my friends, I shall dispatch tomorrow a gentleman to the czar, to endeavour to possess hi«n with pacific thoughts. I have given him letters for my brother, that he may introduce him to your excellency, who will give him such instructions, as , you shall judge necessary. He is a Muscovite, by birth, and having been a loog time known to my friend, and perhaps even employed on the like messages, he assures me, that we may put intire confidence in him. <1 have intimated to him, that he may alledge, for the pretext of his voyage, his natural inclination to serve the czar, by which be was induced to discover to him, that king George is making all the offers imaginable to acquire Bremen of the king of Sweden, at the expenoe of the czar, who is to be the sacrifice or that acquisition. Your excellency will add what other bints you judge convenient. I should think, however, it might be proper, that tltis man should be kept ignoraut of the canal of the physician. I have another letter for him, which may introduce nsy brother to his acquaintance; ami then he may convey messages between your excellency and the physician, till your excellency shall thank fit to have an interview with him. We are assured here, that king George will have none with the czar; and they seem to be very little satisfied with that prince. — Your excellency will have the goodness to remember what I had the honour to write to you in my last, about my lord Sunderland. I have learnt ainoe, that that lord does all he can to make those of his party fond of king George’s project, to open a port at Harbourg; asserting, that England will gain more by it, than even by its Wesfr-India trade. One sees very well whither all this tends. I am working against it. A member of parliament has desired me to inform him of the situation and natnre of that port.” .

Oa the 1st of January, count GyUenbotg writes thus to baron Gortz, after a long account of private business, hiring of ships, tec. “Since writing what goes before, my friend has been with me, and has told me, chat the money, as 4

for as twenty thousand pounds, was ready, if I iwoald but give my acquittance, that I bad received it for the use of the king my master; and this only, that he might have something to shew to those, who made' this collection, supposing, that hereafter they should ash for it. I answered him, That I could not give any such acquittance, without your excellency’s order, which I would write for this post. He told me likewise, That they had already, by order of the 'court of Avignon, remitted 8,000l. to baron Sparre. — Since writing these lines, the Dutch mad of the 25th is just come in, which my brother advises me, that your excellency was setting out upon your journey. It will therefore be unnecessary to send the express, especially since the two letter^ intended are now become useless. I will, however, send a duplicate of this next Monday, by the French post, together with the pieces abovementioned. — Your excellency wdl receive, this day, the copy of a letter, which M. Petkum writ yesterday to baron Sparre, the contents of which confirm the ill intentions of those warm men, into whose hands the management of affairs is going to be put; particularly if it be true, as M. Petkum bos assured me, that my lord Townshend, to whom he read the said letter, owned, that what be had writ, in relation to our affairs, was true. All that we have to flutter ourselves with is, that 'the misunderstanding, which there is among these gentlemen, may perhaps be of service to ys. Thus much, at least, is certain, that, if we set ourselves in'earnest about the great work, the success cannot possibly fail.”

The next is a Letter from count Gyll'enburg, to baron Gortz, then at Paris, dated at London, January 7, 1716-17, as follows:u Yesterday I received the Letters your excellency did me the favour to write qie of the 29th past.. That concerning the conduct of this court came very seasonably. I gave it to read to One of the principal Whigs, with whom I have found means of contracting a friendship. As I am to dine with him tomorrow, I shall know what effect it has had. He is already in a good way, and I question not but may be carried yet further by such just reasoning. — M. Petkum is charmed with your excellency’s Letter to him. He exclaims publicly against the Haiioverihns for the gross falsehood they have told of him. I believe him innocent as to this fact. He has told me, he will write himself to your excellency by this post. Mr. Walpole’s reply is remarkable. My friend, who is one of the companions of the Whigs, has told me the same thing. If it be not the effect of the present discontent, and the court does not find expedients to regain those people, I do net know whether the court will ever venture to bring that matter upon the stage; but I shall not be satisfied wih that.* — I am trying to get it brought into parliament my own way. My friend is labouring that point with me, and, to that end, is endeavouring to inform himself thoroughly of the whole. It was for him, that I demanded the

other day of your excellency the particulars of Harbourg; and it is likewise upon his request, that I beg your excellency will seud me, as soon as may be, all that you shall be able to pick up in relation to the treaty concluded between Hanover and oar enemies; particularly if you can procure the agreement, by which the as* sistance of an English force is stipulated to them. Your excellency sees hereby what I ana now doing on one side and the other; that is to say, with regard to our friends. I can do nothing before I have received your excellency’s orders up«n my last.”

The following Letter from'baron Gortz, to count GyllenbuTg, is dated from Paris; January 8, 1717: “ I could not acquaint you before this day, that I am now authorized to enter into the affair, which you know of; and that I am allowed the liberty to do in it' what* ever I shall think convenient. You will be able to judge of this yourself by the' inclosed copy o£ the full power, that ha9 been sent to me. Which way 9oever I turn this affair, I'do not see, that we can engage in it upon any other foot, than that, which I proposed to you at first. As interest is the rao3t certain security of treaties, and what we are solicited to undertake, is of so great importance to us, and the most expeditious means to re-establish our affairs, that can he devised; no man can doubt, that we shall apply ourselves to it heartily and earnestly; and that we could wish for nothing better, than to do it without the concurrent assistance of others, if the juncture of time would suffer us to dispense with that assistance. — The only thing I see wanting for our purbose, are men of war and transports. Of the first I can have two in Holland, and six in France, all rigged and armed; and those, who have the disposal of them, oblige themselves to deliver them in that condition at Gottenburg in the mdnth of March. The last we shall not wapt, but we must immediately put our hands to the work, which requires money. M. Sparre has assured me, that I should find an hundred thousand crowns ready here; but I learnt at my arrival* that our friends, far from doing what they had promised, are now grown cool; so that I thought best, Sir, to desire you to press your friends to-a speedy resolution, whether on the foot pro* posed they will forthwith supply u$ with money, which we must have to purchase those men of war, or not. In case they will, it is necessary they should order it‘to be paid to me here as soon as possible, that I may put those, who art to furnish me with the ships, upon getting them ready. If they will not, this business ought to be broken off intirely, without thinking any further of it. To lose four weeks more would be losing all, for this year at least; and afterward* the circumstances of affairs will so change, that there can he no thinking of it any longer. - — For the rest, our intention was to transport 12 thousand men; eight thousand of them infantry, and four thousand cavalry, of which, fire hundred mounted. We were to tarry with

415J PARL. HISTORY, 2 Grows*I. 17 IT.-^JPaperr relative to tkcinttnded £41$

us fe. sufficient train of artillery, arms for ten or twelve thousand men more, vyith requisite stores of ammunition. We were to land at the places, whether we should be directed; so that we should have carried with us all that is necessary, /excepting horses, which we expected to find in the country; and all might have been, executed without the least umbrsge being taken; provided, that on the other side the secret was kept. M. Sparre telis me, that the reason of the coolness of these gentlemen in this country, is the treaty between this court and England, and the ensuing departure of the Pretender out of this country. For my part, I take this reason to be a very weak one; for as this treaty, and the departure of the Pretender out of this country, must make the court of England think themselves in perfect safety, and deprive them of the pretext of keeping up their troops, our enterprize is become more easy, and more sure. And to imagine, that this court, at the bottom of their heart, would not be bet? ter pleased to have the Pretender on the throne of England, than the elector of Hanover; especially if the first continued to carry himself well towards this court, is to have a wrong notion of its interest, and of the private sentiments of the duke reg.ent.--M. Sparre tells me further, that our friends he’re think we shall not have occasion for any more meu of war Chan those eight, which we have at Gottenburg; but they are to know, that those ships are but of forty guns each; so that it would be hazarding too much, and exposing a body of chosen troops (for such we should take on this expedition) for three or four large ships would he sufficient to give them chace, and to take them all. But, when we shall have the eight ships, which carry from sixty to seventy guns, nothing less than a squadron could oppose them, and, )>efore they could be fitted out, the blow would he struck.

44To conclude, Sir, I wait here for a speedy yea or no; and I continue to advise you not to Send any account of this matter to the court; for our ministers themselves are ignorant of it, and know not for what intent'they have been obliged to give the turn they have to the full power which they dispatched. Aut nunc aut nonquam:Now or neveras well for our friends as our enemies. — When you have fixed this affair, at least for what relates to £he men of war here, I am very desirous you should come over to meet me in Holland, urider pretext of being ordered thither; and that you should put the court in hopes of returning with some acceptable offer, to the end wejnight concert together all that remains for our enterprize; after which I would set out myself for Sweden, to order every thing for making sure of the execution. I communicate to you the subjoined copy of the Full Power, which his majesty has been graciously pleased to give me:

On the 13th of January, N. S. 1717, baron Gortz wrote from Paris the fo/lpwing letter to count Gyllenbnrg: 44 I am to acquaint you, that our friends here are charmed with ray scheme. They have caused one hundred thousand hvres to be paid me dowft, and have promised to get the rest paid to me in Holland, to the sum of one million of guilders. 1 will go therefore, and give orders for working with all possible dispatch on the men of war, and for providing and bringing together all necessaries.

I shall also go back with all expedition to Holland:whence you will have further advice frqm me. I shall wait there with impatience the corning of your express, and of the person who is to speak to the physician."

At the same time M. Gustavus Gyllenborg wrote the count his brother the following Notes After the baron had signed his letter to you, he ordered me to tell you in his name, that it is absolutely necessary our friends should determine speedily, and cause the money to be remitted, and paid to us, without any delay; for otherwise we cannot have the men of war from this country, time enough."

Upon the receipt of baron Gortz’s Letter of tire 8th of January, with the' king of Sweden’s full power, count Gyllenburg wrote an Answes to the baron at Paris, dated at London, Jan, 15, 1717, whqcqtn , h$ heg^ leave to >oawt

“ Whether his excellency would have him, for the future, add the title of plenipotentiary to the direction of his letters. As to our affair (continues he) I went immediately to the house of one of the principal of my friends, and with-but taking notice of any coldness of the gentlemen in France, I told him, in order to engage him to speak, that I had just received your excellency’s orders to give such an acquittance, as had been demanded of me. He seemed very well pleased, and told me in answer that be, who had the direction of the whole affair, being gone again into the country, and being not to return before Saturday next, nothing could be done till Monday; but that then he questioned not but I should be satisfied. We ehall see what that gentleman will say at his return; and unless the gentlemen in France have mAde my friends here alter their opinions, (which- I do not yet find they have) I nope all will go as we would have it; and in case that should not happen so, I am very much of your excellency’s opinion, that we shall leave all those gentlemen to their ill destiny, and go another way to work. — My Whig friend was - charmed with your excellency’s letter, which he rgad over and over. Many others of the same party begin to change their language in our favour. I send my brother a little piece, which is'just published at my charge, and writ in a pretty moderate stile. There is something in it. of -my own. What is said in the postscript, in praise of the prince, is in order to gain the prince’s party, which is already well inclined towards us. — If your excellency thinks it proper to order me to Holland, I should be of opinion, that you should send the like orders to monsieur Petkura, on pretence, that you would receive information from us both together, concerning the posture of affairs here with regard to our Common interests. That would not give any umbrage, and one might easily find out ways of amusing M. Petkum.”

Before this letter reached baron Gortz, he writ another to count Gyllenburg, dated at Paris, January 16, 1717, N. S. as follows: “ I have just now received here, your letters of the 1st, 3d, 4th, and 7th. You may depend upon it. Sir, and assure your friends, that the expedition to England does at present take up all our thoughts and attention. It will depend but upon two things; one is, the procuring four or five ships of war; and the other is money. I know where to get the former, but I can do nothing without the other. I cannot sign the contracts that are offered me. Your friends must take care to remove that obstacle, and to provide for the other squadron. There is not a moment to lose: The time is very short: Our friends on this side have assured me, that the money should be ready forthwith. By your letters I am to believe, there are 20,000l. ready. I herewith send you. the acquittance, which I have given here, that you may draw yours .conformably to it, which you will exchange hereafter for mine, which I will send

We are here agreed upon the plan of our enterprise; and I am promised a man to be sent to Holland, who will hring me what farther informations may be wanting. You may likewise assure your friends, that our prince will certainly be of the party; but I conjure you to give nothing in writing about this hego-ciation, except what relates to the acquittances upon the foot above mentioned. — I do not expect to hear from you any more here, but in Holland; and, if your man should haVe been got thither in my absence, he would have found Stambke fully instructed. — I herewith send you back the contracts signed, according to your desire. The positive promise of letting than have iron, puts pie under some 'difficulty, because I had no. thoughts of preparing for .so great a quantity. As to your money, you may keep an account of what you shall receivey

4,000 crowns. I have not yet proposed to the king that augmentation; but I am in hopes of obtaining it for you. — In the mean time, employ all your skid, in order to give the court aH the trouble that is possible, in the next session, in relation to their conduct in the affairs of the North; and tell me from whence proceeds the good disposition wherein Walpole seems to be.” ,

The form of the Acquittance mentioned and inclosed in this Letter of baron Gortz to couiip Gyllenburg, is as follows: *1, the underwritten ‘ plenipotentiary of his majesty the king of

, this to me sooner, having been obliged to go intp the country the moment the affairs was dispatched. He added, that he bad desired farther orders from my lord Mar, with respect to the place, where the rest of the money should be paid1. I doubt m>t but that baron Sparre has already bath advice of all this^ and that be has acquainted your excellency with it; which, however, I beg you would forthwith let ime know, that I may tjuiet the minds of my friends here, who imagine, that the said baron doth not act in concert with *your excellency in an affair, wherein the least misunderstanding might do a great deal of mischief.' I have told them, that your excellency designed, that I should come to you ; n Holland, to concert every thing with you; with which they were very well satisfied. But I have told them, that 1 will not go tbither with empty hands, and that they ought at least to- get 10,000l. ready for me to carry with- me. I have also desired them to get me a letter from the brother of the czar's physician, which might serve to introduce me to him, if your excellency thinks fit to employ me to speak to him. I cannot express to your excellency my concern, that the affair above-mentioned should have taken a turn, which I did not expect; ‘ and which, for ought I know, may not be pleasing to yonr excellency. Even my friends are dis-satisfied at it, every thing being done unknown to them. But, as they are obliged to have great regard for the director of the affair, who is a person of very great consequence, they must seem to be satisfied. If your excellency, after this, thinks it necessary for me (o come to Holland, I beg your orders therein ae soon as possible, that 1 may take my measures. — After I had written- these lines, I received the favour of your excellency’s ef the 13th, from whence I perceive, with a great deal of pleasure, that .our affair is begun. I read it to< one of my friends, who told roe, that that was the sum, of which he bad spoken to me some days ago, and which I mentioned in one of my former: that be then believed it to.he 8,000l. but that it was but 6, 500/. which exactly answers that which has been paid to your excellency, and which makes part of the 20,000l. that has been remitted. He has pro* mised me to hasten the rest, but I should think, that it would be.necessary that our friends in France, from whom |hey expect the orders, should pray them to dispatch it with all haste. He has given me hopes, that I shall have a good sum with me, when 1 go to Holland.”

The next Letter is of count Gyllenburg, to baron- Gortz, dated at London, January 33, IT IT, in which he writes thus: — ‘‘The day before yesterday, I received the favour of your excellency’s of the 16th. The inclosed triplicate of that which I had the honour to write your excellency by the last post, will shew you the train, that our affairs are in. In the meantime I have told our friends, that your' excellency thought my voyage to Holland aibso-fatelj necessary, ia order to concert with me

the necessary measures for the enterprise; hut, ehat your excellency would by no means have me stir from thence, without carrying with iris what raotaey should be necessary. That it therefore lay upon them now to make the best use of the time, which was so precious to us, and to put me in a condition of going with the first opportunity. — They promised me to do their best, that my voyage might not be deferred longer than the end of the next week. In case I can by that means bring them to hasten their dis-’ bursement, it will afterwards depend upon your excellency’s pleasure, whether I shall go to pay my respects to you or not. — Your excellency may be assured, that I do all in my power to traverse the ill designs of our enemies. The printed piece inclosed, wherein I have spoken entirely as an Englishman, is a small specimen of what is to follow. I do not know whether Mr. Walpole’s expressions were the effect of his first rage, on account of his brother-in-law, my lordTownshend’s being removed, or whether they came from his heart. We shall be better able to judge of those gentlemen after the king’s arrival, when it shall appear, if they have reason to be satisfied; for it is from thence, that they will form their scheme ef politics. — It is strongly reported here, that, your excellency has made a declaration, that the king, having waved all preliminary demands, has accepted the emperor’s mediation, and agreed to send his plenipotentiaries to Brunswick, I most humbly beg your excellency will let me know what truth there is in it.”

The next Letter is from baron Gortz to count Gyllenburg, dated at Paris, January 2T, 1717, N. S. wherein he says: “ Yours of the 18»h, with the duplicate, is come safe to my bands. Your friends are in the wrong, to imagine, that M. Sparre and I do not act ia concert in this affair. He has communicated every thing to me with tlte greatest exactness, and not being authorized himself'to enter upon this- affair, nor to receive the money, he has left all to my disposal. I have even put into his hands acquittances, where the sum is left in blanks, that he may make use of them in my absencetyas soon as the money is come. The friends, which are in France, shall be writ to, to press those ia England, to furnish, as soon as possible, the million of Dutch guilders, which we have agreed on; and I must needs tell you, that I cannot take (he least step in relation to the ships, which are absolutely necessary to us for carrying on this enterprise, before I am ia possession of that whole sum; for, if I should begin, and the money afterwards not come- in the sum employed upon this occasion woidd he lost; not to speak of the disgrace it would be for me, to have entered upon an affair without being able to go through with it. — -As for your voyage into Holland, that likewise depends on the payment of this money.

informations tending to the execution of our design, which may still be -wanting. I wilt write next post to Petkum, to come along with you.” i

The Lords' Address of .] After the

Kind’s Speech had been read in the House of Lords, the duke of Newcastle moved for an Address of Thanks, which was agreed to nem. eon. Next day, - his grace reported the said Address, which occasioned a debate:lord

Coningsby having enforced what was suggested therein, viz. That the -late peace was treacherous and dishonourable; the. bishop of London thought it incumbent upon him to defend it, and said, “ That he drew up himself the instruments of that Treaty; and that, in his opinion, it was as good a peace as had been concluded for these forty years past.” Hereupon lord Coniugsby replied, u That he did not intend any personal reflection, but that the venerable prelate who spoke last, might remember, that about two years ago, when the ministers, who made the late peace, were impeached, his lordship declared, that lie was kept in the dark, and scarce knew any thing of what was doing at Utrecht.”

Feb. 23. The Lords waited upon the king with their Address; which was as follows:

“ Most Gracious Sovereign;

“ We your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled, beg leave to return your majesty our most humble and hearty thanks for your majesty’s most gracious Speech from the throne; and to congratulate your majesty on your safe and happy return to these your dominions; and on the prudent administration of his royal highness the prince of Wales, under your majesty, and the great care he took of the peace and security of the kingdom, during your majesty's absence.

' ; “ VVe are sensible that the gross defects and pernicious consequences of the late Treaty of Utrecht could not have been remedied but by your majesty’s unwearied application for. the good of your subjects; and by that just regard which 4s paid by foreign potentates to your known wisdom and integrity. It is with-. unspeakable satisfaction that we see your majesty’s endeavours successful in such conventions, as have already given new life to our trade and credit; and particularly, in the treaty lately concluded with France and the States General. As your majesty has, by this Treaty, recovered tons, in so great a measure, those advantages which might have been expected from a glorious and successful war, and were given up by a treacherous and dishonourable peace; we beg leave to congratulate your majesty upon an alliance which opens to us so fair a prospect of an undisturbed succession, an equal balance of power, and a flourishing commerce.

; U We return your majesty our most humble thanks, for your majesty’s gracious, condescension, in having laid before your parliament

1717. — Addresses of both Mourn, [49 *

the discoveries concerning the intended Invasion; and cannot but regard with the utmost horror and indignation, the malice and ingratitude of those who have encouraged such an attempt against their king and country.

“ We are sorry to find that yoor majesty’s lenity has been ineffectual towards the reclaiming a faction, who have rendered themselves so obnoxious to your justice: and we do assure ' your majesty, that We will, to the utmost of our power, support your majesty against the designed Invasion, and all your enemies, both at home and abroad, in such a manner, that, by the blessing of Almighty God, neither the rashness of the one nor the wickedness of the other, shall be ever able to prevail.”

The King's Answer.] The King’s Answer was as follows:

“ My Lords;

“ I thank you for this Address, which is so full of expressions of duty to me, and zeal for your country; and I make no doubt but that with your support and assistance, under God, we shall get the Letter of all our enemies, both at home and abroad.*”

* The Commons* Address of Thanks.] After the Papers relating to an Invasion from Sweden was read in the House Commons, Mr. Thomas Onslow moved for an Address of Thanks to his majesty. He was seconded by sir John Brownlow, who said, That had no need of the king of Sweden to maintain the English liberties and support the church of England. This, in count Gyllenborg’s and baron Gortz’s letters, was hinted to be the pretence of the intended Invasion. Mr. Hungerford took this occasion to say, That he was sorry to find that a member, he bad in his eye, (meaning Mr. Robert Walpole ), was mentioned in those letters; but that he had the honour to defend him formerly, and would be ready to do the like for the future.

February 31. Mr. Thomas Onslow reported the Address to his majesty, which was read and agreed to by the House; after which, they ordered, nem. con. That a bill should be brought in to authorize his majesty to prohibit commerce with Sweden, during such time as his majesty should think it necessary for the safety and peace of this kingdom. A member having moved for declaring War against Sweden, general Stanhope said. That it was time enough to do that, if the king of Sweden refused to disown the practices of his ministers.

February 33. The House presented the following Address to the king:

“ Most Gracious Sovereign;

“ Your majesty’s dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great Britain in .parliament assembled, return your majesty their humblest thanks for your most gracious speech from the throne.

« Your majesty's safe and happy return into your kingdoms gave an universal joy to all your people; and as the prudent adifquistta-

tion of the government by his royal highness the prinee of Wales, under your majesty, did in some degree make the want of your royal presence more easy to us, we beg leave to congratulate your majesty upon the peace and security that, during your majesty’s absence, was, by the great care of his royal highness, preserved in the kingdom, to the general satisfaction of all your subjects.

“ We can never sufficiently acknowledge the repeated instances of your majesty’s goodness, and unwearied concern for the welfare of your kingdom; we see with admiration many of the fatal defects of the Treaty of tJtrecht, and the great disadvantages that were imposed upon this nation, at the head of a victorious army and powerful confederacy, happily remedied by your majesty, even in the midst of intestine dangers and, troubles. Your consummate wisdom has renewed those alliances that were basely betrayed and dissolved, and concluded such new treaties as may render the peace safe and lasting; and we are at a loss to determine, whether in future ages the suffering the demolition of the port of Dunkirk to be scandalously evaded, will be a greater reproach, or the procuring the destruction of the sluices of Mardyke a greater honour to the British nation.

“ We cannot at the same time, but with the highest resentment and indignation, look upon the obstinate and inveterate rancour of those who are again endeavouring to embroil their native country in blood and confusion. It is astonishing to find, that any, who call themselves Protestants, can be so inflexible and restless in their endeavours, to impose upon us a Popish Pretender; and rather venture to subject the kingdom to a foreign yoke, than depart from their darling and avowed design of altering and subverting the present happy establishment in the protestant succession.

"We adore the watchful eye of heaven, that has so wonderfully guarded and protected your sacred person, and cannot too much extol the wisdom and vigilance that have been used in so early and seasonably discovering this desperate attempt. And in order most effectually to defeat it, your faithful Commons, with hearts sincerely zealous in the cause of their king and country, assure your majesty, that they will to the utmost stand by and support your majesty against all your enemies at home and abroad, that shall in any manner presume to aid or abet the Pretender to your crown, and will most cheerfully granc to your majesty such Supplies as shall be found necessary for the safety of your royal person, and the defence of the kingdom.

“ We are all but too sensible of the unsupportable weight of the National Debts, and therefore will not neglect to apply ourselves with all possible diligence and attention, to the great and necessary work of reducing and lessening, by degrees, this heavy burthen, which .may prove-the most effectual means of pre-servmgtothe public funds a r^al and certain security, ' i

The King’s Answer.'] To. tins Address* his majesty gave the following Answer:

\ “ Gentlemen:-

“ The duty and zeal which you express, in, this loyal Address, to my person and government, your affectionate concern for the welfare of your country, your promises of an effectual support against all our enemies at home and abroad, and your resolution of applying yourselves to ease my people, by reducing gradually the heavy load of the public debts, deserve my hearty thanks. You shall never have*cause to repent of the confidence you repose in me: the honotir, welfare, and prosperity of the nation being what I have chiefly at heart.”

Motion relating to the Land Forces.] March 4. In a grand committee on the Supply, it was moved to take into consideration the estimates relating to the land forces: upon which, sir Rob. Davers, Mr Freeman, and Mr. Hunger ford endeavoured to get that affair put off to another day, by moving that Mr. Farrer, the chairman, should leave the chair. They alledged, ‘ That the late Rebellion being happily suppressed, and the Swedish Conspiracy seasonably discovered, there was reason to hope, that the counties of England would soon be eased of the grievous burthen of quartering soldiers; but if it appeared, that the king of Sweden persisted m his design to invade Great Britain, they^ would all readily give their votes for keeping' the present forces on foot. Mr. R. Walpole, general Stanhope, Mr. John Smith, Mr. W. Pulteuey, general Lumley, and several other courtiers, on the contrary, urged the necessity of taking speedy and vigorous resolutions in relation to the army; and after a debate that lasted hear two hours, the question being put. That the chairman leave the chair, it was carried in the negative, by a majority of 2231 voices against 57.

Debate on Mr. R. Walpole's Motion for. borrowing 600,000 I for the public Service at per

cent.] Marche. Mr.Farrer reported the Resolutions taken the day before, in the graud committee on the supply; which being agreed to,

Mr. R. Walpole moved, and it was resolved, nem. con. “ That whosoever shall advance or lend any sum, not exceeding 600,000l. for the service of the public by sea or laud, shall be repaid the same with interest, at 4/. per cent, out of the first Aid to be granted this session of parliament. “ The putting the interest of this intended loan so low as 4/ per cent gave reason to surmise, that those, who had the management of his majesty’s treasury, designed to put on the same foot the interests of all public Funds:Whereupon,

Mr. Lechmtre took notice, “ That several

schemes and proposals for reducing the National Debts had beeu printed and dispersed, which gave the persons concerned in the public securities the greater uneasiness, in that there was reason to apprehend, that those schemes qm/p abroad with the privity «o4

countenance of men in great places:That the general alarm which this bad occasioned among the monied men, might «very sensibly affect public credit, and be, at this juncture, of very dangerous consequence: To prevent which, he thought it necessary, to move, That the House would come to a resolution, effectually, to make good all parliamentary engagements. To this

Mr. Robert Walpole immediately answered, That his majesty having, with great tenderness, recpmntended to them from the throne, the reducing, by degrees, the Debts of the Nation; and the Commons having afterwards in their Address to his majesty, promised to apply themselves, with all possible diligence and attention, to that great and necessary work, they ought to exerbthemselves, to make good that promise, and appoint a day to take that important matter into consideration: And he did not doubt but the Commons would then shew all possible regard to justice and public faith. He owned there had been, indeed, several Schemes published, relating to the Reduction of the National Debts, but that they were made by private persons, and, he did assure the House, without the participation of any of his majesty's ministers, and therefore they were not to be regarded; but that in a short -time, such proposals would be laid before the House, as. he hoped, would give them satisfaction, and meet with their approbation; therefore he moved, That Mr. Lechmere's motion might be thus altered, viz. *That this House will effectually make good the deficiencies ef all parliamentary engagements/' This, after a short debate, was carried in the affirmative, nem. con. But mention being made of the great services done by the Bank of England, and those, who by their money had supported the court interest and the present establishment.

Mr. Aidabie took notifce of the management of some Directors of the Bank, who, upon the alluring prospect of gain, were as ready to sup-pert the late ministry. On the other hand, a courtier having defied any body to charge any breach of public faith, or of the laws, on the administration, since his majesty's happy accession to the throne, i

Mr. Hungerford said, That this put him in mind of a Coronation, when the king’s champion coming into Westminster Hall, throws down one of his gloves to make the Challenge, but that he never saw any body so bold as to take it up.

March 8. While the House was in a Committee on the Supply,

Mr. Lechmcre told them, That he was sorry he found himself obliged to tike notice, that their late vote for a loan, at per cent interest, was like to prove ineffectual, there not being in three days time above 45,0001. subscribed to the loan of 600,000l. on the Land-tax. And therefore since the present exigency required a speedy Sapply, he thought it necessary, and therefore moved. That a day be Uppqiuted to consider farther of that matter *

Mr. Robert Walpole seconded this motion, and said, That there .was the greater necessity for it, because he was informed, that some Stock Jobbers, in order to deter the parliament from pursuing the design of reducing the p'ublic Debts, had formed a combination to distress the government, and ruin public credit, which was the occasion that the late Vote for borrowing 600,000l. at 4/. per cent, had not had the desired effect. To this

Mr. Lechmere answered, That as none but the most wicked of men could enter into such a combination against the good of their country, so the honourable member that spoke last, would do well to name them, that the House might shew the utmost resentment and iudig-tion against them. But that in his opinion, the ill success of the loan was rather mainly occasioned by some reflections on the monied men and Stock Jobbers, and by certain maxima lately advanced, viz. That the parliament may exert their authority to extricate themselves, by reducing the National Debts; that such maxims could not but alarm the persons concerned in the public securities; and the more, when they saw that a slur had been put upon the motion made three days before, That all parliamentary engagements shotild effectually be. made good." That he still thought such a Vote absolutely necessary both to remove people's fears and jealousies, and to vindicate the honour and justice of the nation; and that the’ same was entirely agreeable to his majesty's sentiments, who in his first Speech to this parliament, had been pleased to recommend to the Commons, in a particular manner, the strict observance of all parliamentary engagements, than which nothing could more contribute to the support of the credit of the nation; with which opinion of his majesty the Commons did entirely concur; and that he could not believe, that any of his majesty's ministers could be so regardless of his honour and known equity, or put so hard a thing upon him as to make him in the least contradict what lie had. in so solemn a manner declared from the throne. He added, That the Commons having already appointed a day to consider of the State of the Nation, with relation to the Public Debts, he would notanticipate that important affair: but he could not for^ bear declaring on this occasion his private opinion, that it would be the greatest ingratitude, as well as injustice, in the least to wrong those who had supported the government in the most pressing exigencies and perilous junctures, and, on all occasions, shewn their zeal and affection for the Protestant succession. That he had nothing to say, as to such public securities as. were redeemable by parliament; but as to Annuities granted for terms of years, he would be positive, that they could not be meddled with, without breaking in updn parliamentary engagements, and violating the public faith; since those annuities were not to be looked upon as debts, but as a sale of annual rents for a valuable consideration, of which contract the

487] PARL. HIST. 3 George 1. 1717. — Resolutions respecting the Public Debts. [4$£

parliament had proposed -and made the terms and conditions, and the rentees became purchasers upon the parliamentary faith and security. And that, besides the injustice of break, ing through a national contract, these annuities could not be touched, without occasioning great confusion and disputes in private families, by reason that most of the said annuities had been settled for portions, jointures and the like. *

Mr. Walpole in answer to this ', declared, That there never had been a design to use any compulsion with relation to Annuities; that, indeed, an alternative might he offered to the proprietors of them, but that it should be in their choice either to accept or refuse it; and as for such funds as were redeemable, that nothing should be proposed that did not entirely consist with justice and public faith.

Mr. Aislabie took also that occasion to ex-

plain some expressions he used, in the debate of the 5th instant, in relation to the Bank of England, which had been construed amiss; owning, that they had supported the government in the most difficult exigencies:and that in his opinion, if any thing ought to remain untouched, it should be the Bank.

After a debate of about two hours, it was resolved to consider farther of the Supply, in a grand committee, on the 13th of March.

March 9. The House agreed to the resolutions of the committee on the Supply, so that the money already voted amounted to above two millions.

Resolutionsrespecting the Public Debts."] March 23. Mr. Farrer reported, from the committee of the whole House, to whom it was referred to consider of the State of the Nation, in gelation to the National Debt, the Resolutions which they had directed him to report to the House; which were read, and agreed to as follow;

1. " Resolved, That all the public funds, redeemable by law, that do not exceed five pounds per cent, per annum, be redeemed according to the respective provisoes, or clauses of redemption, contained in the acts of parliament for that purpose; or with consent of the proprietors, be converted into an interest or annuity not exceeding five pounds per ceut. per annum, redeemable by parliament.

2. “ That his majesty be enabled to borrow of any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, such sum or sums, of money as shall be requisite to redeem the said redeemable funds at any rate, not exceeding five pounds per cent, per annum; and to secure the same upon the funds so to be redeemed.

3. “ That the annuity of 106, 501/. 13s. 5 per annum, payable to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, out of Hou^e-Money, by virtue of several acts of parliament in that behalf, for the principal sum of 1, 775, 027/. 17s. 10£d. by them advanced, be redeemed; or, by consent of the said governor and company converted into an interest or annuity.

not to exceed 5/. per cent, per annum, redeem able by parliament.

4. “ That so much of the fund, commonly called the aggregate fund, settled by an act of parliament in the first year of the reign of his present majesty, as is applicable to the interest, circulation, exchanging, or Cancelling, the present exchequer bills, be also redeemed. 1

5. “ That his majesty be enabled to authorize the high treasurer, or the commissioners of the treasury, for the time being, to treat and:hgree with any person or persons, bodied politic or corporate, for circulating such a number of exchequer-bills, at a rate not exceeding four, pounds ten shillings per cent, per annum, for interest, exchanging, and circulation, as may be charged and secured upon that part of the said’aggregate fund so to be redeemed.

6. “ That the annuities of 600,000l. and 8,000l. per annum, payable to the Governor and Company of Merchants of Great Britain trading to the South-Seas, be also redeemed.

7. “ That the annuities payable by an act of parliament, of the 12th year of the reign of king William, to certain patentees therein named, their heirs and assigns, out of the weekly sum of3, 700/. charged on the Excise, be also redeemed.

8. “ That the several terms of years remaining in the duties appropriated by the two lottery acts, made and passed in the ninth year of the reign of her late majesty queen Anne, of-blessed memory, and by two lottery acts made and passed in the tenth year of her'said late majesty’s reign, be made perpetual.

9. “ That the said duties comprehended in the said four lottery acts, be made one general fuud for the future.

10. “ That the proprietors of the orders, grounded on the said lottery acts, do, w/ithin a limited time, make their elections, either to ac- cept annuities after the rate of five per cent, per ann. redeemable by parliament out of such general fund; or be paid so much as remains due to them on their orders respectively.

11. That, in aH cases where the proprietors shall choose to have their principal, the five per cent, per annum, saved thereby, be made another fund, towards answering such suras of money as shall be advanced, towards discharging the said principal, by loans, or other securities, as shall be thought proper.

12. “ That his majesty be enabled to give power for receiving voluntary subscriptions from any person or persons, intitled to any of the annuities issuing out of the public funds, for the residue of the respective terms of 99 years, 96 . years, 89 years, or 32 years, formerly purchased, therein, not being subject to redemption, who shall be willing to accept, in lieu thereof, perpetual annuities, redeemable by parliament; and to allow, for the remaining terms in the said, annuities, which were purchased for 99 years, 96 years, or 89 years, at the election of the respective subscribers, either so much aa. the same annuities shall amount to at 19 year*.

14. “ That all the said duties now in being, or to be continued, shall immediately cease and determine after the said National Debt, and all interest due thereupon, is discharged, and

/ paid, off.”

Debate on the Mutiny March 23.

Upon the motion for a second reading of a Bill sent up from the Commons, for punishing Mutiny and Desertion, the duke of Buckingham moved to jfcit it off till the Thursday following; but some Lords having observed, that such a delay might be of very dangerous consequence to the government, because the last Act against Mutiny determining the next Monday, many soldiers might take that opportunity to desert with impunity; the second reading was put off only till the next day. — On the 25th the Lords read the said Bill a third time, when the lord North and Grey excepted against a clause, whereby common soldiers are exempted from arrests for debt, which his lordship urged, encourages idleness and vice among tradesmen and Artificers, and occasions frequent bankruptcies. Several other objections were raised against the bill by the duke of Buckingham, the earls of Abingdon and Auglesea, the lords Harcourt and Trevor, who were answered by the lord Cowper, the

' 'dukes of Devonshire and Newcastle, and the earl of Sunderland; and the question being put, That the kill do pass, the same \vas carried m the affirmative by 32 voices against 9.

Protest against passing the said But

upon this occasion six lords entered their Protest: asfoHows:

* Dissentient';

- 1. “ Because no particular reason or occasion is so much as suggested in this Bill, for keeping on foot a standing army, consisting of

32,000 men, in this kingdom, in time bf peace; and therefore this Act will be a precedent for keeping the sane army at all times, though

17X1 . — Debate on the Mutiny Bill. [490

this kingdom be in peace ; , which, we think, must inevitably subvert the ancient constitution of this realm, and subject the subjects to arbitrary power.

2. “ Because, by this Bill, the soldiers are exempted from being arrested by process of law, at the suit of any person for recovering a just debt, or upon any action whatsoever; which is a great injustice to the subjects, taking from them the benefit of the law for recovering their just demands, and for obtaining satisfaction for any injury done them by a soldier, either by wounding or maiming, or wrongfully taking away his goods: and, we conceive, this will be so far from preserving good order and discipline in the army, that, on the contrary, it will be a great encouragement to the soldiers, to live in their quarters in all manner of licentiousness; and to insult their fellow subjects, both in their persons and estates, when they know, that by this law they are disabled from obtaining any effectual satisfaction from them, by the course of justice, for any such violence or injury; and the only reason offered tojustify this exemption from arrests, being to prevent the taking soldiers out of his majesty’s service by collusive arrests, we think the preventing such an imaginary mischief can be no reason to discharge the persons of soldiers from being taken upon any civil process, where the cause of action is real, which is a privilege only belonging to a peer of the realm.

3. “ Because this Bill doth establish martial law, extending to the life of the offenders, in time of peace, which, we conceive, is contrary to the ancient laws of this kingdom; and the soldiers are obliged to obey the military orders of their superior officers, under the penalty of being sentenced by a court-martial to suffer death for their disobedience; and that without any limitation or restriction, whether such orders are agreeable to the laws’ of the realm, or uot; when, by the fundamental laws thereof, the commands and orders of the crown (the supreme authority) are bound and restrained within the compass of the law, and no person is obliged to obey any such order or command if it be illegal; and is punishable by law if he does, notwithstanding any such order or command, though from the king. (Signed) Trevor, Berkeley of Stratton, Abingdoo, Bathurst, Northampton, Dartmouth.”

Address for Papers concerning the Riots at Oxford.] During the above debate, a peer complained of the disorders committed by the soldiery in several places, particularly at Oxford, and moved, That before they passed a Bill in their favour, they should inquire into the Riot, that happened in that city on the prince of Wales’s birth-day. The courtiers insisted on the necessity of passing the Bill before them without delay; but consented that the Oxford Riot should be enquired into; whereupon some lords, of the other side endeavoured to wave it by proposing a general inquiry into the conduct of the army.

opposed by the courtiers, who alledged, That they ought not to arraign a body of men, against whom there was no legal complaint: and that such a proceeding could not but be disagreeable, and even injurious to the king, who, by prerogative, has the command of the army; and if any disorders nre committed’ by the soldiers, the complaints ought first to be laid before his majesty; but that since it had been moved to enquire into the Oxford Riots, which had made a great noise and had been examined in his majesty’s council, they ought to address the king, that he would be pleased to cause all the Papers relating to that affair to be laid before the House.

This Address being resolved upon; pursuant thereto, on the 29th of March, several Papers relating to the Riots at Oxford, on his royal highness’s birth day, were laid before the House.

Debate thereon] April 3. The House being in a grand Committee, all the Papers relating to the said Riot were read: after which there ensued u great debate; the bishop of Bristol, the archbishop oif York, the bishop of Rochester and the bishop of Chester, endeavoured to justify the University, alledging, “ That for 40 years past they had not paid any regard to the birth-day of any prince of Wales, or even of the prince sitting on the throne, by public rejoicings. That the University had a method of expressing their loyalty, more consistent with the dignity of their founders, and the character of their persons, than by illuminations nnd bonfires. That as for the mayor and magistrates of the city of Oxford, they were ignorant that it was the prince’s birtb-day. That the several Affidavits and Informations upon which the said mayoT and magistrates grounded their complaints, having been sent up to court, copies of the same were returned to the officers of the regiment, quartered at Oxford, to give them an opportunity to justify their proceedings, which produced another set of affidavits and depositions in behalf of the said officers. That the magistrates had no opportunity to make any replication in their own defence, and therefore it was moved, that the House would come to no Resolution upon the foot of the two sets of affidavits, but that they would adjourn the further proceedings, and appoint a day, when they would hear the persons concerned in those informations v voce:they insisted upon this method, because nothing could set this matter in a truer light than the cross-examining and confronting the evidences on each side; urging, That this method was the constant practice of the courts below, and even of all the hearings at the bar of their lordships House, and that their lordships had never yet refused to admit of a replication. That as to the disrespect to the Prince Regent charged upon the University, for their neglect of ranging the bells, on his royal highness's birthday, of the sixteen colleges in the University, •nly three had any bells to ring: and that it

I. 171 1.-~X)ehate concerning th? £48R

appeared plainly by the Affidavits, taken before the mayor and magistrates, that the riotous proceedings on the coronation day, and the’ birth day of his royal highness, were occasioned by the insolence of the soldiers, encouraged by several mem hers of the University, calling themselves the Constitution-Club, and by the neg-, lect of the commanding officers of the regiment, in not issuing proper orders to suppress the disturbance.” The duke of Buckingham, the earl of Abingdon, the lords Harcourt, Trevor, and North and Grey, spoke also in favour, of the University and magistrates of Oxford.

The Lord Coningsby hereupon said, That

he knew the usage of the University to have been otherways than had been represented, and gave a short account of their behaviour in the reigns of king Charles 2, and James 2, and distinguished between their past and present loyalty. His lordship owned, That in those two reigns they had expressed their loyalty in a most extraordinary manner, and had made such great advances to countenance an unlimited power in the prince, that if Providence had not miraculously interposed, they bad as far as in them lay, destroyed the liberties of their country, which would have involved theUniversity in certain ruin.

The lord Cowper, the duke of Kingston, the earl of Sunderland, the lords Parker, Townshend, and Cadogan observed, “ That the disrespect to the prince regent, charged upon the Univerity and city of Oxford, was manifest, because the major of the regiment did, about ten in the morning, go to the may<fr, and complained, That he had shewn no regard to his royal highness’s birth day, by ringing the bells; to which the mayor returned a shuffling answer, pretending he did not know it to he the prince regent’s birth-day. Upon this the major told him, he woald draw out his regiment to celebrate the said day with proper, rejoicings, which he did accordingly; but that the mayor, instead of joining the said rejoicings, filled up the public street with a vast mob after him, and some of his attendants insulted the soldiers on their march, and gave them opprobrious language, crying out, Down with the Round heads.’ That they proceeded so far in their insults; as to throw dirt and stones at the soldiers, and even attempted to disarm some of them. That the house wherein the officers of the regiment and some of the collegians met, to celebrate the festival, was, in an insolent manner, assaulted, and the windows broke by stones thrown from the opposite house of one Hurst, an ironmonger, upon which the soldiers, to revenge the affront, began likewise to break windows, of which the major was no sooner informed, but he immediately went out and bid them desist.' That it was indeed affirmed in some of the affidavits produced in behalf of the University and magistrates, That a certain collegian went round the bonfire, and encouraged the soldiers to break the windows of the said Hurst, and all that were not illuminated: but that the same was contradicted by no less than five or six persons* who* upon

|$3] PARL: HIST. 3 George I. 1717Resolutions relating to Oxford Riott. [434

oath, declared, That the said collegian was, from seven till ten that evening in their company, and had not stirred from the house all that time. That upon the mayor's applying to the major of the regiment, the latter gave immediate orders for patroles to go through the city and send home to their quarters all the soldiers.they should find in the streets; and that the patroles being insulted by some of. the mayor’s attendants, two or three soldiers fired, but with powder only, pursuant to the orders given them.”

Resolutions relating to the Oxford Riots.] In the middle of this debate, the earl of Abingdon offered, a Petition from the vice-chancellor and the mayor and magistrates of the city of Oxford, and insisted, that it should be read; but it was urged on the other side, That the House being.in a Grand Committee, the receiving any petitions was irregular. Hereupon it was moved, that the chairman should leave the chair, which being carried in the negative without dividing; the main question was again debated until tfoout six in the evening, when the following Resolutions were agreed to by 65 voices against 33.

“1. That the Lords of |he Committee of Council, to whom the papers relating to the Riot at Oxford were referred, had sufficient grounds to come to die Resolution, reported to his royal highness the prince, viz. That the

* heads of the University and mayor of the ♦city neglected to make any public rejoicings on the' prince’s birth-day; but some of

* the collegiates, with the officers, being met to celebrate the said day, the house where they were, was assaulted, and the windows were broken by the rabble, which was the be-

* ginning and occasion of the Riots that, ensued,

* as well from the soldiers as the scholars and ‘ townsmen, and that the conduct of the major (seems well justified by the affidavits produced ‘ on his/ part.

(i 9. That the printing and publishing the De-

* positions, upon which the complaints relating

* to the Riots at Oxford were founded, while that matter was under the examination of the lords of the Committee of Council, and before they had time to come, to any resolution

4touching the same, was irregular, disrespectful

* to his royal higtmess the prince, and tending

* to sedition. ’

Protest thereon.] The House being resumed, these two Resolutions were immediately reported, and a motion being made to agree with the Committee in the said Resolutions, it was carried in the affirmative by 58 voices against 39. - Whereupon the following Protest was entered.

“ Dissentient,

. 44 1. Because, by this Resolution, the beads of all the Colleges and'Halls within the University of Oxford stand censured, as we apprehend, for disrespect and want of duty to his royal highness the prince, in neglecting to make public rejoicings on his birth-day; whereas it sufficiently appeared to us, that no rejoicings ' VoivVU,

had ever been'made before that time, within the said University, on the birth-day of an heir apparent to the crown, or even of the sovereign, except-only on the 99th of May, set apart by act of parliament, perpetually to be observed as a day of public thanksgiving. And there seems the less reason, in our opinion, for laying so heavy a’ charge on the heads of those leard-? ed societies, inasmuch as they have not been allowed any opportunity of being heard thereto, nor even knew themselves to be auy ways accused in that particular.

“ 2. Because the proceedings of the major, as we conceive, are not to he justified by law, if the affidavits which were sent to make good the complaint against the major and soldier be considered, as well as those affidavits which, were produced on the major’s part, there being several enormities, charged, as well on the major, as on the soldiers under his command, by the former affidavits no way answered by the latter, or so much as denied by the major himself in any of his own affidavits or letters..

41 3. Because, we conceive, the matter of fact relating to the breaking the windows of the room wherein the major and others were, with some stones from Hurt’s the ironmonger’s house, has not been sufficiently examined into, for want of giving an opportunity to the complainants of replying to the affidavits relating to that matter; and suppose the truth of that fact had actually appeared upon a full examination, yet it cannot be pretended to be a legal justification of the major, for inciting or suffering the soldiers under his command, to go through the city insulting the magistrates, and breaking the windows of many citizens, who are-cot pretended to have given the least offence to them.

“ 4. Because the officers and soldiers of the army may take occasion, from-this Resolution, to think themselves exempt from the civil power in criminal cases, and be induced thereby to contemn and resist the authority of the civil magistrates, to which they are, m such cases, as liable as any other of his majesty’s subjects.

“ 5. Because the civil officers and magis1 trates may probably be discouraged, by this Resolution, from doing their duty on such occasions, and his majesty’s subjects be deterred from making their just complaints, in an humble and dutiful manner, of any oppressions which they have suffered, or may suffer, from any officers or soldiers in the army.

Motion relating to the Bishop of Munster's and the Duke of Saxe-Gotha's Troops.] March

26. The Commons resolved to address his majesty. That the Treaties made with the 2F

* m wmm*? giom* x- im-r-w*. <* *

bishop of Munster and the duke of Saxe-Gotha, for putting six battalions of their troops into his majesty’s service, might be laid before the House. According to which Address, general Stanhope, two days after, presented to the House the said Treaties, with translations of thfe same. It was generally supposed, that these Treaties were called for with a design to find fault with them, and to bring a censure upon some German ministers, who' bad been employed in those transactions: but a motion being made the Aext day, and the question put, That an Address be presented to his majesty, that be will be pleased to give directions, that the Instructions given to his majesty's ministers, who transacted the Treaties for taking four battalions of the bishop of Munster's troops, and two battalions of the duke of Saxe-Gotha’s troops into his majesty’s pay, to supply the place of such as, during the late rebellion, should be drawn from the garrisons of the States General of the United Provinces to assist his majesty, may be laid before this House, it passed in the negative by 165 votes against SQ.

The King's Message for a Supply against Sweden.] April 5. Mr. Secretary Stanhope delivered to the House, the following Message from the King:

“ G. R.

w His majesty being desirous, above all things, not only to secure his kingdoms against the present danger, with which they are threatened from Swedeu, but likewise to pre-Tent, as far as is possible, the like apprehensions for the future, thinks it necessary, that such measures should be early concerted with other princes and states, as may conduce most effectually to this end. And as this may require* some expence, his majesty hopes that his Commons will, by their assistance at this juncture,

’ enable him to make good such engagements, as may ease his people of all future charge and apprehensions upon this account.”

The consideration of this Message was put off to the next day.

Debate on the Supply, ] April 4. Mr. Secretary Stanhope moved, That a Supply be granted to enable his majesty to concert such measures with foreign princes and states, as may prevent any charge or apprehensions from the designs of Sweden for the future. He urged the advantage and security that would redound to the nation, by enabling his majesty to reduce the king of Sweden; and what confidence they ought to repose in the king’s honour, wisdom, and ceconomy in the management of what money should be thought necessary for that service. Hereupon . Mr. Shippen said, That it was a great misfortune, that »o wise and so excellent a prince as his majesty, was as little acquainted with the usage and forms of parliamentary proceedings, as with the language of our country: that if he had known either, he would not have •eut such o Message, which, be was sure, was

unparliamentary and unprecedented, ; and, therefore it was his opinion, that it was penned by some foreign minister, and then translated! into English: that since the king's accession to the throne, ' there had* been many reflections cast, in that House, upon tlje Tate ministry, as if they had betrayed the interest of their. country: that, on the contrary, they had often been told, that his majesty had retrieved the honour and reputation of the nation; the efr fects of which bad already, appeared, in the flourishing condition of our trade: tljat after all this, he could not but he very much surprised to find a motion made for a Supply of money, to enable his majesty to enter into new measures, to secure his kingdom against any future apprehensions from the Swedes: that the necessity that was urged for this, seemed to be inconsistent with the accounts of those glorious advantages his majesty had obtained for as: and he could not help being of opinion, that if the new alliances and measures to be concerted, were such as to be obtained purely by the force of our Money, that ever the happiness or*the security of the nation could be the consequence of such counsels; for, whenever foreigners come tp taste the sweetness of English money, we might depend upon it, that their adherence to our interest would' last no longer than we continued to supply their necessities.

Mr. Hungerford, who seconded Mr. Ship-

pen, said, That for his part, he could not understand what occasion there was for new alliance*, . much less that they should be purchased with money: that it must needs be very surprising to the whole world, that a nation, not long ago the terror of France and Spain, should'now seem to fear so inconsiderable an enemy as the king of Sweden; especially when we had so good a fleet at sea, bnd so great an army oA land. — Some other speeches were made on the same side, which gave

Mr. Secretary Stanhope occasion to say, That he was sorry to find gentlemen grow so warm upon a subject of this nature:that the king was a prince of that integrity and honour, and had already given such convincing proofs of his tender care for the true interest of the nation, that they might entirely depend upon his wisdom in this matter; and therefore he was of opinion, that none would refuse com- piiance with this Message, but such as either were not the king’s friends, or who distrusted, the honesty of his ministers.

This gave offence to several members; and

Mr. Lawson replied thereupon, That he was very much surprised to fiod such unguarded expressions fall from that worthy an^ honourable gentleman, for whom, he was sure, the whole House had a very great regard; but since he had thought fit to speak so openly, he. hoped he might be well justified in saying, that if every member of this House, that used freedom of speech on any subject of debate, must be accounted an enemy to the kjnfo

When he happens not to fall in With his mi* sisters, he knew no service they were capable of doing for their country in that House; and therefore it was his opinion, that they had nothing else to do, but to retire to their country-seats, and leave the king and his ministers to take what they pleased.

Mr. Boscawen, sir Gilbert Heathcote, Mr. Horatio Walpole, and some other gentlemen, backed Mr. Secretary Stanhope's motion; but Mr. Grimstone, ant} some other courtiers, spoke on this occasion on the contrary side. However, it was moved, and resolved, That the House would, upon the Monday morning hexr, resolve itself into a committee of the •whole House, to consider of the motion for a Supply. After this it was also resolved, To address his majesty, that the Treaty made between the late king William and the present king of Sweden, be laid before the House.

April 6. Pursuant to the above Address, Mr. Secretary Stanhope laid before the House a copy of the said Treaty.

April ?. The Commons went into a com* initteeof the whole House, to consider of the motion for a Supply to be granted to his roa-

e, against the designs of Sweden for the e; for the necessity of which, general Stanhope alledged several, reasons, and was seconded by Mr. Craggs, jun. Mr. Boscawen, Mr. Aislabie, and several others. On the other side, Mr. Shipper ), Mr. Hungerford, Mr. Hutcheson, the Iora Guernsey, Mr. Herne, member for Dartmouth, Mr. Ward, and some others, urged. That it was unparliamentary to frant a Supply before the occasion was known, and an Estimate of the expence was laid before the House: that the king's Message about this matter, was so unprecedented, that his majesty's ministers seemed to be divided about it; and that it was a great misfortune such divisions should happen among the ministry, for then a parliament cannot have a true information of things:that they could not easily apprehend what occasion there was to make new Alliances, since we had a. standing army ip Great Britain, and a considerable fleet at sea, which sufficiently secured his majesty’s king-, floras against any danger from Sweden; that if we designed to make an offensive war against that crown, 'why did we not send part of our forces’ on board our fleet ? Especially, since we were now secure at home, both by the suppression of the fate Rebellion, and by the, conclusion of the Triple Alliance, which tfye regeqt of Trance had begun faithfully to perforip, by Causing the Pretender to pass the Alps. t However, if the court insisted on the necessity of entering into new engagements against Sweden, fhey thought it proper to address his majesty, (0 acquaint the Hpuse with the nature of those engagements, and, the sum that was requisite to m^ke them good.

Mr. Secretary Stanhope answered, 'jfbat the dtscovej-v of'thejateConspiracy^ carried op by the Swedish' minister ^, in conjunction with the

discontented party at home, sufficiently evinced the necessity of a standing army in Great Britain:that the Treaty of Triple Alliance seemed, indeed, tr» secure us against any danger on the part of France; but that it was to be observed, that the said Treaty had met with so great opposition at the French court, that had not the regent stickled strenuously for it, i$ would have infallibly miscarried; and though hitherto we had all the reason imaginable tq commend the honesty and candour of that prince; yet, iu good policy, we ought not t$ depend. on that treaty any longer than it shall be the interest of France to observe it. And as to the motion for the Address, he added, That it would be injurious to the king's prerogative of entering into such alliances as his majesty thinks necessary for the good and security of his dominions, without communicating the same to his parliament:which prerogative was grounded on very good reasons; fo$ if the crown was obliged to impart the secret of affairs to so great a number of persons, the most important negotiations must thereby miscarry.

Sir Gilbert Heathcote, an alderman of LonT don, mentioned the great losses anti damage# which the British subjects had sustained by I their ships being made prizes, and confiscated in Sweden; and observed, That the king of Sweden having several times refused to make satisfaction; and, on the contrary, his ministers having endeavoured to raise a new\re-r bellion in his majesty’s dominions, there was ground to declare war against biin.

, Mr. Gould, mejmber for Shoreham, replied. That the Dutch having sustained as great losses by the Swedes, they bad an equal concern with Great Britain to declare war against them; and therefore it would be proper, before the House proceeded farther, to engage Hol-landj in^ the first place, to prohibit all commerce yvith Sweden, as we bad done.

. Mr. Secretary. Stanhope, said, That be made no. doubt but that the States General Woatd readily cotoe into any measures tiiat should appear necessary for the good end interest of both, nations in general, and to obtain satisfaction for. the late depredations of the Swedes in particular: that their High Mightinesses had lately given signal instances of their flrm adherence totheerownof Great Britain* in causing the Swedish ministers to be seized in; their dominions, upon his majesty's desire;

: bqt that the form and xonstiiution of their government, and the. good of their subjects,

; who mostly subsist by trade, did not permit jthem to take such vigorous and speedy resolutions as could be wished; and therefore it would not be fair to exact (he same from them.

, Mr. Craggs, jun. pressed the necessity of making new alliances against Sweden, from the late doubtful .conduct of a northern potentate, (meaning theCzar of Muscovy) who, by his |inactivity against Sweden, and the post some qC .hjs troop#, had taken, gave great umbrage to the empire *

4S91 PARL. HISTORY, 3 George I. 1717. — [440

Mr. R. Walpole, sir Edward Northey, and lord Molesworth, spoke also on the same side.

Sir William Thompson, in particular, urged, What would the world think of this parliament, if they should refuse to supply the king at this exigency ?

On the other hand, Mr. Compton (the Speaker) and Mr. Smith said, That they were not against the Supply, but against the demanding and granting of it in such an unparliamentary manner; and Mr. Speaker prosed, That part of the army should be dis-nded, and the money, thereby saved, applied towards the making good such hew engagements as were thought necessary to be entered into; but lieutenant general Mordaunt, and some others urged how unsafe and impolitic it would be, at this juncture, to disband any of the troops.

Mr. George Catwell, a goldsmith, closed the debate by a shert smart speech which was much applauded He said, That for his own part he would rather pay others for fighting than fight himself: that he thought it more Advantageous for Great Britain to carry on’the, war abroad, and enjoy peace at home, in order to improve our trade, and reduce our public debts; and that, as the employing foreigners against Sweden, would be a far less expence than national troops, he therefore was for complying with his majesty’s message.

At last, about five in the afternoon, the question being put, upon the motion for a Supply, the/ same was carried in the affirmative, by 164 against 149.

April 9. . Mr. Farrer reported the said Resolution to the House, upon which there arose a fresh, but short debate: Mr. Shippen, Mr. Hungerford, Mr. Hutcheson, Mr. Smith, Mr. Herne, and others, insisted again on the un-parliamentariuess of asking and granting Supplies without an estimate of the etpeqfe; and proposed, * either to present an address to the king to assure hind, That the House would effectually make good all the engagements his majesty should think proper to enter into; or that his majesty be desired to disband part of the army, and apply the savings towards the mew alliances. Both these expedients were opposed by general Stanhope, Mr. R. Walpole, Mr. Hort.Walpole, Mr; Bailie, and Mr. Hampden; the last of whom in particular, in answer to what was suggested. That this manner of asking and granting Supplies, was unparliamentary, and unprecedented, said, That he remembered about ten or eleven years before, a great man in that House (meaning, |Mr. Compton the Speaker ), made a motion for allowing and providing for about 900,000*. which the government had expended without laying any estimate before the Commons. To this Mr. Speaker said, He wondered that gentleman, would bring in as a precedent, a business that was transacted so many years ago, and which wasmot parallel to the present case. Whereupon Mr, Hampden replied, That he did not

thereby intend to reflect upon Mr. Speaker, since he had the honour to vote with him upon that occasion.

A Supply granted only by a Majority of Tour Votes.] After this, the Resolution for granting a Supply to his majesty, to concert such measures with foreign princes and states, as may prevent any charge or apprehensions from the designs of Sweden for the future, was agreed to, though by a majority only of 153 against 149. *

* u The good understanding between the different members of administration, did not long continue. It soon appeared, that the king’s promises of favour, made by Bernsdorf to Townshend and Walpole, were not fulfilled; and that he placed his chief confidence in Sunderland and Stanhope. New divisions took place; Townshend and Walpole continued to defend the measures of government, but their support was cold and formal, and so different from their former zeal, as plainly shewed extreme disatisfaction. Sunderland had now considerably increased his phrty, and thought himself sufficiently strong to carry on the public business, and defy the opposition. In this situation, an open rupture in the cabinet was unavoidable. The first public symptoms of this difference appeared in the House of Commous. On a motion that a Supply be granted to enable the king to concert such measures with foreign princes and states, as may prevent any apprehensions from the the designs of Sweden for the future: Walpole, who, on all such occasions used to give a great bias to the House, maintained a profound silence, and the Resolution was carried by a majority of only four voices.

“ As it was evident that this mode of inimical proceeding originated from the party, of which Townshend was leader, he received, on the same evening, a letter from Stanhope, announcing his dismission..

“ The king himself so highly appreciated the services and talents of Walpole, that he dreaded his resignation, and was persuaded to remove Townshend, under the belief that he would still remain at the head of the treasury. When Walpole, therefore, on the following morning, requested an audience, and gave up the seals, the king was extremely surprised. He refused to accept'his resignation, expressed a high •=ense of his services, in the kindest and strongest terms; declared that he bad no thoughts of parting with so faithful a counsellor; intreated him not to retire, and replaced tiie seals in his hat. To this Walpole replied, with no less concern than firmness, that however well inclined, he might be to obey his majesty’s commands, yet It would be impossible to serve him faithfully with those ministers to whom he had lately given his favour. ‘ They will propose

* to me/ he said, both as chancellor of the

* though not the author, must be answerable

* to my king and to my country for all the

* tration.’ At the conclusion of these words, he again laid the seals upon the table; the king returned them not less than ten times, and when the minister as often replaced them on the fable, he gave up the struggle, and reluctantly accepted his resignation, expressing great concern and much resentment at his determined perseverance. At the conclusion of this affecting scene, Walpole came into the adjoining apartment, and those who were present, witnessed the anguish of his countenance, and observed that his eyes were suffused with tears. Those who immediately entered into the closet, found the king no less disturbed and agitated.

“ These removals were soon followed by an almost total change in the administration. Devonshire, Orford, and Methuen, and Pul-teney resigned; Stanhope was appointed first lord of me treasury, and chancellor of the exchequer; Sunderland and Addison secretaries of state; the duke of Bolton lord lieu* tenant of Ireland; and the duke of Newcastle lord chamberlain; the earl of Berkley first lord of the admiralty, and the duke of Kingston retained the office of privy seal, to which he had been nominated in the preceding year, on the resignation of Sunderland, who was made treasurer of Ireland for life.”

Coxe's Walpole.

* “The resignation of Walpole happened at a time when he was exerting his abilities for finance, in the arrangement of a scheme highly advantageous to the country. When he was first placed at the bead of the treasury, the National Debt amounted to 50 millions, and although the common interest of money had been reduced in the late reign to 5 per cent, yet the interest of some of the debts was as high as 8, and none lower than 6; so that the average was 7 per cent. The difference between this rate of interest, and that on private mortgages, preseuted a real fund for lessening the public debt.

resigned his places, by saying, 4 That he now pro-sented that Bill as a country gentleman, but he hoped it would not fare the worse for having

“ This debt was considered under two heads; redeemable, and irredeemable. The redeemable, or such debts as had been provided for by parliament, with a redeemable interest of so much per cent, the-public had a right and power to discharge whenever they were able, either by providing money for such proprietors as insisted upon money, or by offering new terms, in discharge of ail former conditions, which, if accepted by the proprietors, was to be deemed an actual redemption of the first debt, as if it had -been paid off in ready money. As for the irredeemable debts, or long and short annuities, nothing could be effected without the absolute consent of the proprietors. The only method, therefore, to treat with them, was to offer such conditions as they should deem advantageous.

“ Upon these principles Walpole gave the first hint of this great scheme, by proposing to borrow 600,0001. bearing interest only per cent, and to apply all savings, arising from the intended redemptions, for the purpose of reducing and discharging the National Debt, which was the first resolution ever taken in parliament in order to raise or establish a general sinking fund. When he brought his scheme into the House, the project appeared so well di- . gested and advantageous, that the opposition which had been intended was converted into approbation, and every article was agreed to.

“ Unfortunately for the completion of this great arrangement, the able projector was no longer in office. On bringing in the bill, Walpole gave a hint that be had resigned his places, by saying, / that be now presented it as a country gentleman/ but hoped that it would not fare the worse for having two fathers, and that his successor would take care to bring it to per* fection.’ The difficulties which he bad to encounter in this scheme, will appear fronx the consideration, that no reduction of interest could be made without the consent of the public creditors themselves. It was solely by hit address aod management, that the companies of the Bank and South-sea, agreed not only to reduce their own interest, but to furnish large sums for the discharge of such proprietors of the redeemables as should refuse to comply with an equal reduction; a striking proof of the general esteem in which be was held by the proprietors of the national debts; of their regard for his judgment, and oonfidence in his equity.

“ The resignation of Walpole caused a great sensation in the House of Commons, where regret for the want of his talents for finance, seemed to prevail, and he was as much inveighed against for resigning, as he was afterwards reviled for remaining in power. His withdrawing from government at this crisis, was called a defection* a criminal conspiracy, with a view to embarrass the king, and to force him to comply with his unwarrantable demands.” — ' One's Walpole.

Further Debate on the Supply, ] April 12. The Commons Went into a committee of the whole House, to Consider of the Supply granted to his majesty; and Mr. Secretary Stanhope having made a motion for granting to his majesty the sum Of 250,0007. to enable him to concert measures against Sweden; there was for a minute or two a great silence in the House.

Mr. Pulteney, who broke it first, expressed

his surprize at it; and added. That as for his part, be had not yet Said any thing to this matter, because he thought it inconsistent with decency to oppose a motion that came from the Court, while he had the honour to be his majesty’s immediate servant; but that having resigned his place, that he might act with the freedom becoming an Englishman, he could not forbear declaring against thC granting a Supply, in a man-tier altogether unparliamentary and unprecedented:that he could not persuade himself, that any Englishman advised his majesty to send such a Message; but lie doubted not, but the resolutions of a British parliament would make a German ministry tremble. He was seconded by the

Lord Finch, who even found fault with some Steps that had been taken in relation to the affairs of the Northern Alliance; and said, That it appeared by the Memorial presented by' the Russian minister, and by the Answer returned, that such measures had been pursued as were like to engage us in a quarrel with the Czar. Upon this

Mr. Secretary Stanhope Spoke in Vindication

6f the king and hb ministers, in relation both to the Czar and the king of Sweden. With respect to the first, he said, That he hud hitherto been Obliged to be Silent; but that he Was"how fit liberty to Set this mutter in a clear light, and to acquaint the House, that the ColdnCsS which appeared of late between the king and the czar,

. proceeded from his majesty’s refusing to become guarantee of his czarish riiajesty’s coh-CneStS; and from his majesty’s soliciting the cfcaf to Withdraw his troops from' the duchy of Mecklenburg: that as to the firSt Of those matters, his majesty’s conduct deserved the applause add the thanks of a British parliament, since it appeared thereby, that his majesty Wak fender not to engage the nation in foreign quar-tfeli: that this, indeed, bad been hiS majesty’s principal Care, since his happy accession to the throne; and he might assure them, that Great Britain Was entirely free from any engagements, and at liberty to follow sdeh measures as best sbh with her interest: that as for the instances WhiOb hiS mhjeSsy has caused to be made with the czar, and' the measures he may have concerted1, tO get the Russian troops Out' Of the dubby of Mecklenburg, his maj esty has acted in all this aS elector and prince Of the empire: that he WUS' persuaded; fill the gentlemen there

as king of Great Britain, was never Understood to tie up his bands with respect to his interests in Germany, and a prince of the empire: bdt besides, he must desire gentlemen to consider, that long before his majesty’s accession to the crowta, Great Britain was in strict union with the emperor and empire; so that if, by virtue of ancient alliances, the emperor should require GrOfit Britain to use those instances with the czar, which the king has made only as elector of Hanover, .Great Britain could not avoid complying With his Request: that in relation to Sweden, the king’s conduct wfis not only blameless and unspotted, but worthy of the highest commendations: that in the late queen’s time. Great Britain interposed to procure a neutrality in the North, whereby the king of Sweden might have preserved his pos>cssim»s in die empire:That the regency at Stockholm agreed to this overture; but that the kingofSwedca rejected it with haughtiness and the utmost scorn, declaring, he WoUld use those as his enemies, who should pretend to imposp such a neutrality Upon him: That during the whole course of that Negotiation, the king, then electoV of Hanover, used all friendly oftites in favouV of Sweden:That all this having proved ineffectual, through the king of Sweden’s obstinacy, aiid the king df Dehmark having, by the fortune of war, re-conquered the dutchies of Bremen and Verden, his majesty; as elector of Hanover, has purchased thfe same with his awn money, for a valuable consideration: That although it never was in his majesty’s thoughts to engage Great Britain in a war to support that acquisition, yet, if gentlemen Would give themselves the trouble to cast their eyes upoii thi map, to see where Bremen and Verden lie, hii bdpfid they would not be indifferent as tb the possessor of these tWo dutchies, but would agree With him, that their being in the king’s hands suits far better with the interest of Great Britain, thau if they were in the bahds either of the czar, Whb gives already but too much jealousy to the empire; or of the king of Sweden/who endeavoured tb raise ti new rebellion in Great1 Britain, and fiarbiurs our fugitivd rebels.

wrhat bad been advanced by th$ honourable member who spoke last; but if an estimate of the conduct of the ministry, in relation to affairs abroad, was to be made by a comparison of their conduct at home, he vjas sure they would not appear altogether so faultless as they were represen ted, Was it not a mistake, added be, not to preserve the peace at home, after the king was come to the throne, with the universal applause and joyful acclamations of all his subjects? Was it.not a mistake, upon the breaking out of the Rebellion, not to issue out a Proclamation, to offer pardou tp such as should return home peaceably, as had ever been practised before upon such occasions ? Was it not a mistake, after the suppression of the Rebellion, and the trial: and execution of the principal authors of it, to keep up animosities, and drive people to despair by not passing an act of indemnity and grace, by keeping so many persons under hard and tedious confinement, and by granting pardons to some, without leaving them any means to subsist ? Is it not a mistake, not to trust to a vote of parliament, for making good such Engagements as his majesty shall think proper to enter into; and instead of that, to insist on the granting of this Supply in such an extraordinary manner? Is it not a mistake, to take this opportunity tp create divisions, and render some of the king’s best friends suspected and obnoxious ? Is it not a mistake, in snort, to form parties and cabals, in order to bring in a bill to repeal the act against occasional Conformity ?

Mr. Secretary. Stanhope replied, That he had had the honour to serv.e his majesty, since his ‘ happy accession tp the throne, but as there were other persons, some of them ip, and othprs out of place, who had a greater share than himself in the administration, of affairs, he left it to them to justify themselves: That however, he would clear a principal point, by assuring the committee, that he bad, some time ago, the king’s orders to draw up an Act of Indemnity.

Mr. Barrington Shute, member for Berwick,

said, That the king was indeed come to the throne with the joyful acclamations of most of his subjects; but that the disaffection that appeared soon after, did not proceed from the ill conduct of his ministers, but solely from the removal of some persons in great employments: That nevertheless, in the changes that were then made, his majesty had followed the rules of 'prudence, justice and gratitude, since he advanced those, who, in the worst of times, bad given undoubted proofs of their affection and attachment to his interest, in the room of those who had been preferred in the last reign, as the fittest instruments to destroy the Protestant succession even before it took place, and who had since been in open rebellion against his majesty: That as for the other mistakes charged upon the administration, they might be reduced to these two, viz. The not passing the Act of Indemnity, and the design to repeal the Occasional Bill: That as to the first, there were

various.opinions about it; and considering the restless spirit of the discontented party, it was hard to determine, whether an Indemnity was a proper way to reduce them; since it was no?-torious, that the repeated instances of clemency which his majesty has given since his accession, have been abused and despised:That as to th* repeal of the acts against the dissenters, nothing, in his opinion, was either more just or reasonable; and he could not but wonder, that a gentleman (meaning Mr. John Smith) who had been turned out of his employment in the last reign, and restored since the king’s coming to the crown, should account it a mistake, on the one hand, not to grant an Indemnity to his majesty’s declared enemies; and a mistake on the other hand, to make his majesty’s undoubted friends easy.

Mr, Smith, after an explanation, .demanded: > and given about his being turned opt of plaoeand . restored, replied to the last part of Mr. Shute’s speech, That he ever was for allowing^ liberty of conscience to the dissenters, and had even voted against the Occasional Bill, but1 that the same being passed into a law, it. was his opinion, that i(could not. be. repealed without disquieting the whole nation.

Mr. Yonge, member for Honiton, spoke next, and said, That some days before, he bad been against the motion, for granting a Supply upon the king’s message, because he thought i* unparliamentary; and it was then his. opinion to address the king, to enter into such engagements as his majesty shall think proper, and-that the Commons would make good the same; but that, since the majority, of the House had. determined to grant a Supply, they bad brought themselves to this dilemma, either to grant what was asked as necessary, for the service, or to tell the king, that that service must remain unperformed, which they had in. a. manner determined to be necessary by granting a Supply. This speech was backed by

Mr. Gould, who owned, That we could not carry on our trade to the Baltic, -without bringing the king of Sweden to reason, and* therefore he was for granting this.supply. ’

Mr. Robert Walpole, who brought up the rear.

Said, That having already spoken for the supply, be would not refuse the court his vote, and the sum being named, he was for granting it.

Hereupon, it was carried without dividing^ <f That a sum not exceeding 250,000l. be granted, to enable hi3 majesty to cuncert suqh measures with foreign princes and states, as may prevent any charge or apprehensions from, the designs of Sweden for the future.”

April 13. Mr. Farrer having reported this Resolution to the House, some of the members endeavoured to render it ineffectual, by moving that it should he re-committed. To dehato this motion with more frtedom, Mr. Bromley, taking notice that several peers, and others, were got into the House, moved, that the House be cleared of all strangers; which being dope accordingly, Mr. Shippen insisted ou the recommitting of the Resolution, in question. He

was seconded by Mr. Hungerford, sir Thomas Hanmer, Mr. Herne, and Mr. Lawson'; but the other party called for the question; and the said Resolution being read a second time, was agreed to by a majority of 153 against 132.* '

April 16. Mr, Boscawen having acquainted-the House with his majesty’s desire, that they would adjourn till the 6th of May, the House accordingly adjourned to that day.

The King's Speech respecting a Reduction of the Land Forces, an Act, 4'C-] May 6.

The King went to the House of Lords, and the Commons attending, his majesty commanded the Lord Chancellor to read the following Speech to both Houses: x “ My Lords and Gentlemen;

t(It is with great satisfaction that, after this short recess, I can acquaint you with the certain advice I have received, that my fleet is

* “ By this time there was almost a total change in the ministry. The earl of Sunderland was appointed secretary of state, as was also Mr. Joseph Addison: Mr. Stanhope was made first commissioner of the treasury, and chancellor of the exchequer: lord Torrington, Mr. Wallop, Mr. Baillie of Jerwiswood, and Mr. Micklethwaite were the other commissioners of the treasury; sir William St. Quintin, Mr. Methuen, and Mr. Edgecombe, being removed, Mr. Craggs was declared secretary at war; Mr.* Charles Stanhope, coadjutor to Mr. Lowndes, secretary to the treasury; and Mr. Joseph Micklethwaite, secretary to Mr. Stanhope, as chancellor and under treasurer of the exchequer. The earl of Orford resigned his place of first commissioner of the admiralty, which was given to the earl of Berkley. The rpstof the cnmmmissioners of the admiralty were, Mr. Aylmer, sir George Byng, Mr.Cock-burne, and Mr. Chetwynd. The duke of Bolton was appointed lord lieutenantof Ireland, and his place of lord chamberlain of the household, was bestowed on the duke of Newcastle. The duke of Devonshire resigned his place of president of the council.” Tindal.

“ It was remarked by observers at that time that in the comparison the gentlemen who left their places were not succeeded by gentlemen as well qualified for them. Mr. Audison was allowed to be an excellent writer and poet; but no body thought he was so well acquainted with affairs of state as Paul Methuen, esq. who had from his youth been accustomed to such transactions:neither did any one think that sir Thomas Micklethwaite, was as fit for the treasufy board as William St. Qnintin; or John Cockburn, esq. for that of the admiralty, os George Dodington, esq. but the comparison Was much more unequal still between general Stanhope and R. W aipole, esq. as first lord commissioner of the treasury, and chancellor of the exchequer: As to James Craggs, esq. who was made secretary at war in the room of 'William Pulteney, esq. those that made comparisons had nothing to say.” Oldmixou,

safely arrived*in the Sound, which, by the blessing of Almighty God, will secure these kingdoms against any immediate danger of an Invasion.

“ I have, by these means, an opportunity, which is very acceptable to me, of making a considerable reduction in our Land-Forces, having established it as a rule with myself, to consult the ease of my people in every thing, so far as is consistent with their safety. Anri, for my own part, as I shall always place my greatness in the prosperity of my subjects, eo I shall always desire that my power may be founded in their affections. It is upon these considerations, that I have given orders for the immediate reducing of 10,000 men.

“ That nothing may be wanting in me to quiet the minds of all my subjects, I have likewise given directions to prepare an Act of Grace; and however it may be received by those who are obstinately bent on the ruin of their country, I promise myself, that it will raise a due sense of gratitude in all such as have been artfully misled into treasonable practices, against my parson and government, ai>d preserve them from standing in heed of the like mercy for the future, when such an instance of clemency may noc be so expedient for the public welfare, as it would be agreeable to my own inclinations.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons,

“ I thank you for your readiness to support me in the present juncture of affairs, and for the Supplies which you have given; and do promise you, that they shall be employed for the uses to which you designed them.

“ I shall order such faithful accounts to r be laid before you the next session, as will make it appear, there was no other view in asking any particular Supply, than to prevent a much greater expence, which the nation must have unavoidably incurred without it.

tf I must recommend to you, as I did at the beginning of the session, to take all proper me thods for reducing the public debts, with a just regard to parliamentary credit.

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

“The year being so far advanced, 1 hope you will go through the public business with all possible dispatch and unanimity, it being my intention to meet you early the next winter, that the sitting of parliament may be brought into the more usual and convenient season.”

The Lords' Address of .] The king

being withdrawn, the Lords voted an Address of Thanks, which was presented next day, as follows:

“ Most Gracious Sovereign;

“ We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled, beg leave to return your majesty our most husnble thanks for your majesty’s most gracious Speech from the throne, and for your majesty’s having taken effectual care to prevent all immediate danger of an Invasion upon these your kingdoms, by sending your fleet so early into the Sound: and we

449] PARL. HISTORY, 3 George I. 1717. — The Common? Address of Thanh. [45(F

cannot but acknowledge, with the greatest satisfaction, your majesty’s most tender regard to the ease of your people, in giving orders, as ftoon as it was consistent with the public safety, for reducing so considerable a number of the land forces.

. “ We also give your majesty our most humble thanks, for your having communicated to your parliament, your intention to pass an Act of Grace, which we hope will have all the good effects your majesty so reasonably and justly expects from it.

“ And we take this occasion to assure your majesty, that we will, with the utmost zeal and duty, defend and support your majesty’s sacred person and government, against all your enemies both at home and abroad.

The King's Answer.] His majesty’s Answer thereto, was as follows:

“ My Lords, A

“ I thank you kiudly for this very dutiful Address; your zeal and affection to ray person and government, is what, under God, I shall Always principally rely on.”

Mr. Lechmere, moves for an Address, and

^ reflects on Mr. R. Walpole and others for resigning their Places.} The Commons being returned to their House, Mr. Lechmere moved for an Address to his majesty, which not being opposed, a committee was appointed to draw one up.

Mr. Lechmere, in his speech for this Ad-

dress, animadverted upon such of the members as had lately resigned their places, as if they intended to distress the king’s affairs.

Mr. Walpole 'thought fit, in his own vindica-

tion, to say, That persons who had accepted places in the government, had often been reflected on for carrying on designs, and acting contrary to the interest of their country; but that he had never heard a man found fault with, for laying down one of the most profitable places in the kingdom:that, for his own part, if he would have complied with some measures, it had , not been in the power of any of the

Eresent ministers to remove him; but that he ad reasons for resigning his employments, with which he' had acquainted his majesty, and might perhaps, in a proper time, declare them to the House. In the mean while the tenour of his conduct should shew* that he never intended to make the king uneasy, or to embarrass his affairs:and concluded with moving, That the bill, For redeeming the Duty on Houses, * &c. might be read a second time. Upon this

Mr. Secretary Stanhope represented, That several things in that bill wanted to be amended and rectified, and therefore he moved, that the eecond reading of it might be put off to the next day se’nnight; which was ordered accordingly. He likewise made use of that opportunity to take notice tp the House, That he understood it had been the common practice f those concerned in the administration af the treasury, to make bargains for the pub-

Vol. VII.

lie, with the governors and directors of companies, by which some private advantages were generally made:but that, in his opinion, such bargains ought to be made at the bar of the House, by the representatives of all the Commons of Great Britain; and if any advantages could be piade, the public ought to have the benefit of them.

The Commons' Address of .] May 7.

Mr. Lechmere reported the Address to his majesty, as follows:

“ Most Gracious Sovereign;

“We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, crave leave to approach your sacred person, with hearts full of gratitude to your majesty for the many gracious declarations you have been pleased to make to us from the throne.

“ Our duty to your majesty, and our concern for the security of your kingdoms, at a time when the nation was threatened with a desperate Invasion, obliged us to make provision for keeping up such a body of Land Forces, ' as might shew that we were in a posture of defence: but your majesty having grounds to hope, on the arrival of your Fleet in the Sound, that, by the blessing of God, a check will be .put to that design, we must for ever acknowledge, that the early directions you have been pleased to give for reducing such a body of those Land Forces, is the most acceptable pledge you could give your people of your tenderness for them1; and that your majesty has nothing so much at heart as their present and future welfare, and is such an instance of your great wisdom and goodness, as must for ever endear your majesty to all your subjects.

“ We are bound to express our just satisfaction in your gracious intentions of mercy, as being highly conducive to the tranquillity 6f the kingdom, and a convincing proof of your majesty’s desire to reign in the affections of all your subjects.

“ We have so often experienced the happy effects of the confidence vie have reposed in your majesty, that we can never entertain any doubt of the due application of any Supplies granted by us; and do receive, in the most dutiful and affectionate manner, your majesty’s promise to lay the Accounts of such application before us, as a great instance of your justice to the nation.

“ We are truly sensible bow much the ease and prosperity of your subjects depends on the accomplishing that great and necessary work, of reducing the public Debts, and are resolved to carry it on in the most effectual manner, with just regard to parliamentary credit.

“We are likewise fesolved, by the dispatch and unanimity of our proceedings, to convince the world; that we are inviolaLy engaged in duty and affection to your most sacred person and government, on the support of which the welfare and happiness of these kingdoms, under God, entirely depend.”

Mr. Shippen mows for re-committing the

Address.] After the reading the above Ad* dress,

Mr. Shippers moved to have it re-committed; and that an Amendment might be made to that part of it which relates to the Army, which he proposed to be as follows, viz. And

* your loyal Commons have no doubt but your

* majesty will be graciously pleased to make a

* further reduction of the Army, and to conti-

* nue only such a number of forces as hath

* been usually thought, in a time of peace, to

* be sufficient for the security of this kingdom.* To support his motion, he represented the danger of* a standing army; urging, That in Cromwell’s time, a force much less than what will remain in Great Britain after the reduction proposed, had overturned the monarchy, abolished episcopacy, put down the House of Peers, and driven the Commons from their seats.

He was seconded by Mr. Bromley, and backed by Mr. Herne and general Ross; but they were opposed by Mr. Secretary Stanhope, Mr. Robert Walpole, and also by

Mr. Pulteney, who declared. That before

the discovery of the late Swedish Conspiracy, while he had the honour to serve his majesty as Secretary at War, he had received such directions as shewed his majesty’s intentions, at that time, to reduce still a greater numbet of forces, than waS now proposed; and therefore he did not doubt but his majesty would do it as soon as the safety of his kingdoms would admit of it. He added, That, in his opinion, the nation had no. reason to fear any thing from an army, who, for near thirty years past, had given signal proofs of their firm adherence to the Protestant interest, and of their zeal to maintain the liberties of their country; and that if there was any danger at present, it was only from foreign counsels.

At leagth Abe question 'being put upon Mr. Shippen’s motion, it was carried in the negative by a majority of 188 against 80.

Papers relating to the 6,000 Dutch Troops in Scotland.! May 8. Mr. Pulteney acquainted the House, That he was apprehensive of some Mismanagements and Irobezzlements of the public money, in relation to the 6,000 Dntch troops, and the service in North Britain. Upon this it was resolved, to present two Addresses to his majesty; one for an Account of the money given for the payment of the 6,000 Dutch troops, taken into his majesty’s service during the late Rebellion, with the charge of the transportation of the said troops forwards add backwards^distingaisbing each particular under its respective bead; the other for an Account of the distribution of the extraordinaries and contingencies issued out for the service performed in North Britain during the late Re-hellion.

The King's Answer to the Address of Thanks.'] May 9. The House presented their Address of

Thanks to the king for his Speech, who returned the following Answer:

“ Gentlemen;

•* It is with great pleasure that I find the directions I have given, to make a Reduction in the Army, and my intentions to grant an Act of Grace, are so much to the satisfaction of my faithful Commons. I thank you for the hearty assurances you give me of your affections to my* person and government; and shall alwayt make such an use of the confidence you repose in me, as may be most for the advantage of my people.”

Debate on Sir W. Wyndhanfs Motion for Dr. Snape to preach before the House.] May 13. A warm debate arose on a very singular occasion.

Sir Wm. Wyndham having moved. That Dr.

Snape be desired to preach before the House at St. Margaret’s, Westminster, upon the 29th of May; he was seconded by Mr. Shippen, and backed by all the members who bad lately resigned their employments.

Mr. Horatio Walpole, who spoke first after Mr. Shippen, said, That it was unusual, on such occasions, to put the negative bn any man, whom a member of that House had thought fit to name; and that Dr. Snape was not only a person of merit and great learning, but had likewise the honour to be one of his majesty’s chaplains.

Mr. Kobert Walpole said, That he knew Dr. Snape to be a very learned, and a very honest roan:that he bad not only entrusted him with the education of his own children, but also recommended the sons of the duke of Devonshire and lord.Townshend to his care; and therefore he could-uot but think, that he might be trusted with preaching a Sermon before that assembly. %

Mr. Lechmereopposed them, and said. That

he could not but wonder, that a member who had been one of the managers against* Dr.

. Sacheverel, should now speak in behalf of a divine who had asserted the same notions of passive obedience and non-resistance, for which the other had been prosecuted; and who had lately attacked a strenuous and worthy champion of the Revolution and Protestant succession.

Mr. Aislabie answered, That he gave his vote to Dr. Snape because he looked upon him as a learned ana honest man: And as for having writ-, ten against the bishop of Bangor’s [Dr. Hoadley] Sermon, he did not think it a sufficient reason to put upon him a negative, which would be prejudging of a controversy that did not properly belong to their cognizance.

Lord Guernsey also spoke in behalf of Dr. Snape.

Mr. Hungerford said, That if the court bad not interposed, the doctor might have shewn the bishop fine sport; but that the king having ordered his ministers to disband part of th# army, they had, by mistake, disbanded the cotf* vocation. *

458} PAUL. HISTORY, 3 George 1.17 i7. — preach before the Commons, [454

Sir William Wyodham’s motion being thus strongly supported, and Mr. Lechmere being backed only by sir Joseph Jekyll, Mr. Boscawen, Mr. Treby, and a few more, the question was put and carried in the affirmative, by 141 _ voices against 131: and sir William Wyivdbam and Mr. Sbippen were ordered to acquaint Dr. $nape with the desire of the House. *

* As the change in the ministry bad caused

a division among the Whigs, some adhering to those that were in, and others to those that mete out of place, an opposition was formed by those last in conjunction with the Tories, on several occasions. This evidently appeared when nr William Wyndham (who had been discharged) moved, that Dr. Snape should be appointed to preach on the Restoration of king Charles. The doctor was one 6f the king’s chaplains, and master of Eaton-school, but was of high-church principles, and had lately attacked the bishop of Bangor. The controversy mentioned in this debate between the bishop of Bangor and Dr. Snape, was occasioned in this manner: Dr. Benjamin Hoad ley, famous for his steady adherence at all times to the principles of the Revolution, (for which hehad been recommended to the throne by the .House of Commons, and advanced to-the see of Bangor) had lately publisher!, A Preservative against

* the Principles and Practices of the Nonjurors; ’ and soon after preached a sermon before the king, which was printed under the title of,

* The Nature of the Kingdom of Christ.’ To this sermon Dr. Snape published an Answer; and, presently after, the lower house of Convocation (as they had before done with regard to Dr. Samuel Clarke’s Scripture-Doctrine) eutered upon the subject, both of the bishop of Baogor’s Sermon, and of his Preservative. They appointed a committee of six of their members, to examine them, and made their report to the House. The Committee sat and drew up a Representation, in which both the Preservative and Sermon were censured, as tending, < 1. To subvert all government and

* discipline in the church of Christ, and to re-

* duce his kingdom to a state of anarchy and confusion. And 2. To impugn and impeach

* the regal supremacy in causes ecclesiastical,

* and the authority of the legislature, to inforce

* obedience in matters of religion by civil sanc-

* tions.’ This charge was supported by passages taken out of the Preservative and Sermon, and the whole drawn up in the form of a Report, to be laid before the Convocation. But the government, out of regard to the interest of the constitution, in church and state, thought proper to put a stop to these proceedings, by a prorogation to-the 22d of November. As this was industriously represented to be the effect of the bishop’s solicitation, and an argument of his fear, he publicly declared before the world, that the prorogation was ordered, not only without his seeking, but without so much as his knowledge or even suspicion of any such design, till it was resolved. It most be observed, that the

Proposals of the South Sea Company and of the Bank of England, for the Reduction of tha

National Debts?} May 20. The Commons bav-ing resolved themselves into a Committee of the whole House, to consider farther of ways and means for raising the Supply, granted to his majesty, Mr. Secretary Stanhope laid before them the respective Proposals of the South Sea Company, and of the Bank of England, which were read, as fellows:

To the Honourable the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament assembled: The Governor and Company of Merchants of Great Britain, trading to the South Seas, and other parts of America, and for encouraging the Fishery, having under their consideration, how they may be most serviceable to his Majesty and his Government, and to shew their zeal and readiness to concur in the great and honourable design of reducing the National Debts, in such manner as may be consistent with, and for the support of, Parliamentary credit, do humbly propose,

1. That they will be content, and do submit, that their present capital stock of

10.000. 000/. be increased to the sum of '

12.000. 000/. either by subscription or, otherwise, as by their general court shall be thought most expedient.

“ 2. That the 2,000,000l. se to be advanced, shall be paid into his majesty’s exchequer, by four equal payments, the last whereof to be on or before the 24th of December next, and shall be employed towards redeeming the principal and interest charged on the four Lottery Act? of 1711 and 1712, and the Annuities of 3/. per cent, payable for the Bankers debt, contracted in the reign of king Charles 2, and not otherwise.

“ 3. That the present annual sums of 600,000l. and 8,000l. payable to the company, be coutjnued io them, for and in respect of their said 10,000,000l., until the 24th day of June 1718:and that for the 2,000,000l. to be advanced as aforesaid, there shall be allowed to the company an annuity after the rate of 5/. per cent, per annum, from the respective times of payment thereof into the exchequer, until the said 24th of June 1718.

representation was never approved of by the lower-house, so as to be made the act of it: Though many have been led to think it was, by the artifice made use of in the title-page to the printed copy of it. The prorogation of the Convocation did not put an end to the controversy For several of the members, since they could not attack the bishop, as a publio assembly, resolved to take up the cause in a private capacity. Dr. Sherlock, who was one of the committee who drew up the report, seconded Dr. Snape, and these two were followed by many others, insomuch that the tracts published on this occasion, on both sides, are said to be about seventy.” Tindal.

“ Signed by the order of the governor and company of the bank of England. Jo. Ikce, Secretary."

, Debate on the said .] After the

reading of these Proposals,

Mr. Robert Walpole raised objections against them, particularly against that of the South-Sea Company. He was seconded by

Mr, Hutchesonf who endeavoured to shew, That the nation would scarce gain this year 100,000l. by that bargain; and therefore he tyas for putting off this affair till the next session to give the communities time to make more reasonable proposals. He was answered by

Mr. Lowndes, member for St. Maw's, and secretary to the treasury, who said, He had much ado to find out the meaning of the 'member who spoke last; that in the same speech he had advanced, . That the nation would gain nothing this year, and. then owned that the nation would gain 100,000l. That supposing the gain to be no more than the last mentioned sum, yet the.Proposal of the So.uth-Sea Company was not to be rejected, since it would enable the nation to begin to reduce the public debts. That in case the proposals of the communities were not thought reasonable, nothing, in' his opinion, could be more effectual to bring the communities to reason than a vote of that House; and therefore the Commons needed but declare their intentions, and he did . not doubt but the communities would comply therer with. '

After Mr. Hutcheson had replied something by way of explanation, , ,

Mr. Hungerford said, That for his own part,

he ever was of opinion, that the parliamentary faith ought to be preserved untouched and ro-violable; that by keeping up the national credit, England was glutted with money, and was become the general bank of Europe, while roost of the neighbouring states were reduced to streights, and wanted specie. That France bad lost her credit, or rather never had any; and if there was any money in that kingdom, it was in thebands of the regeqt; for what purpose he could not tell. That though the parliamentary faith ought to remain inviolate, yet he did not doubt but the wisdom of the representatives of the nation could find legal ways to reduce the interest of public securities, since the parliamentary faith consisted only in the securing the payment of the capital sums advanced by private persons for the use of the public. That be did not understand wby the public should

pay a higher interest than a private man. That he knew by experience, and in the course of his business, that money may be had at 4/. per, ceut. on good securities; that there was on the floor a member of the House who had lent him 20,000l. at that rate; and therefore it was to be hoped, that the communities, duly weighing all this, would offer to the House more reasonable proposals.

Mr. John Smith backed Mr. Hungerford, and said, That one would have expected, that the communities and monied men, who, to make themselves popular, boast of their zeal for the present government, should orr this occasion, have given convincing proofs of it, by contributing more than they offered to do, towards reducing the public debts, and easing the landed men, who for so many years have born the greatest part of the national burdens. That, in his opinion, it was of dangerous consequence to borrow money of the communities upon the foot of their proposals, since by the granting them a term of years, the parliament debarred themselves of the liberty of taxing public fonds, which they had a right to do, in case of extreme necessity, without violating the parliamentary faith. That, for his own part, he thought the communities ought to be satisfied with one year’s notice; but the season being so far advanced, that there could not be above five months before the next session, he was.for putting off this business till then:and, in t^e mean time, the Communities might maturely consider of it. Hereupon,

Mr. Hop kins, * a person extremely well con-

“ P. What Riches give ns let us then enquire s “ Meat, fire, and clothes. B. What more? P.

“ Is this too little? would you more than live? “ Alas! ’tis more than Turner finds they give. “ Alas! ’tis more than (all his visions past),

“ He was a citizen, whose rapacity obtained him the name of Vulture Hopkins. He lived worthless, but died worth 300,000l. which he would give to no person living, but left it so as not to he inherited till after the secoud generation. His counsel representing to him how mauy years it must be before this could take effect, and that his money could only lie at interest all that tin^p, he expressed great joy thereat, an4

versed in money-matters, and much concerned in the public funds, Spoke in behalf of the communities, and said, in substance, That he had as great a regard to the landed, as to the mo--jiied interest; not only because he had, God be thanked, some land of his own, but also because be was satisfied that the landed and monied interests are entirely the same, since the value of land rises or falls in proportion to the plenty or scarcity of money. That in the course of business, it is usual for those who bprrow, to propose some advantage to the lenders; but thatr on this occasion, the Communities were so far from getting any thing by advancing money to the government, that on the contrary, they sacrificed their own interest to that of the public. That if the' thing was rightly considered, it would be found, that the persons concerned in the South Sea Stock, by contenting themselves with an interest -of 51. per cent, instead of six, to which they are intituled by an act of.parliament, did, in reality, lose 20/. in every 120/. so that the company, by accepting the same annuity for twelve millions which they had before for ten, did in effect present the government with two millions, which being applied to the paying off the Lotteries and other redeemable Funds, great advantages might thereby accrue to the public. That he could not forbear taking notice of what had been suggested by some people without, That the interest of the public funds might be reduced at once -by an act of parliament; but that be hoped no puch thing was ever intended by any that sat in that House; for, in his opinion, it could not be done without violating the parliamentary faith, and giving a dangerous wound to public credit. This speech was answered by

Mr. Aislabie, who took notice, “ That of late

years the Companies of monied men were grown so proud, as not only to treat familiarly with the parliament, but even to pretend to dictate to them; that therefore it was high time to give them a check, and let them know, that the landed ' men, and their representatives, were masters of the main spring and stock of the wealth and strength of the kingdom:and concluded, for putting off this business until the next session." Hereupon,

Colonel Martin Bladen *, Comptroller of the Mint, sheared bow dangerous it w as to delay an affair of so great importance, and he was

said, “ They would be as long in spending, as he had been in getting it." But the Chancery afterwards set aside the will and gave it to the heir at law." Pope’s Works, vol. 3, p. 284, Bowles’s Edit. 1806.

* “ Colonel Martin Bladen was a man of some literature, and translated Caesar's Commentaries. He was uncle to my dear and la* mented friend, Mr. William Collins the poet, to whom he left an estate, which he did not get possession of till his faculties were deranged, and he could not enjoy it. I remember Colons told me that Bladen bad given to Voltaire all that account of Camoens inserted in his I^say on

backed by sir Fisher Tench, member for South- wark. On the other band,

Mr. Rulteney said, He did not know what

private advantage some persons might have in accepting the Proposal of the South Sea Company; but that, in his opinion, no term of years ought to begranted, or, at most, not above three years.

Mr. Secretary Stanhope, being sensible that the opposition made against the Proposals of the Communities, and the reflection of private advantage, were chiefly levelled against him, thought fit to vindicate himself: “ He ingenuously owned his incapacity for the affairs of the Treasury, which were so remote from his studies and inclination, that therefore be, would fain have kept the employment he had before, which was both more easy, and. more profitable to him; but that he thought it his duty to obey' the king’s commands. That, however, he would endeavour to make up, by application, honesty, and disinterestedness, what he wanted in abilities and experience. That hei would content himself with the salary and lawful perquisites of his office; and though he had quitted a better place, he would not quarter himself upon any body to make it up: that he bad no brothers, nor other relations, to provide for; and that, upon his first entering into the Treasury, be bad made a standing order against the late practice of granting Reversions of Places."

Mr. Robert WalpolerM/ho thought himself reflected on in what Mr. Secretary Stanhope had said, replied with great warmth, complaining of breach of friendship, and betraying private conversation. He frankly owned, That while he was in employment, he had endeavoured to serve his friends and relations; than which, in his opinion, nothing was more reasonable, or more just: That as to the granting reversions, he was willing to acquaint the house with the meaning of it: That he had no objections against the German ministers, whom y his majesty brought with him from Hanover, and who, as far as he had observed, had all along behaved themselves like men of honour; but that there was a mean fellow, * of what nation he could not tell, whotook upon him to dispose of employments; that this man having obtained the grant of a Reversion, designed for his son, Mr. Walpole thought it too good for him, and therefore kept it for his own son. That thereupon that foreigner was so saucy as to demand of him the sum of 2, 500/. under pretence, that he had been offered so much for the said Reversion; but that he was wiser than to comply with his demand. And that one of the chief reasons that made him resign his places, was, because he would not connive at some things that were' carrying on.

Mr. Secretary Stanhope answered. Mr. Walpole replied; and some hard expressions having escaped them in the heat of the dispute,

Mr. Hungerford endeavoured to put a stop to it- lam sorry, said he, to see these two great men fall-foul on one another; however, in my opinion, we must still look upon them as patriots, and fathers of their country; and since they have, by mischance, discovered their nakedness, w? ought, according to the custom of the East, as the Scripture tells us, cover it by turning our back upon them. He added, that this unlucky accident had, however, produced some good, in that it had revealed a piece of secret history, viz. the scandalous practice of selling places and reversions; and therefore he moved, That the honourable member who made the discovery, might be called upon to name the person. Nobody seconding this motion.

Sir Joseph Jekyll brought back the attention

of the assembly to the business under consideration, and shewed the danger of putting off till the next winter, the Conclusion of an affair of so great consequence. He was backed by

Mr. Aislabie, who said, That as he never de-

signed, so he would not be thought to oppose any thing that carried the face of public good; and therefore he was for granting to the South Sea Company the term of years that had been mentioned, viz. six years, and a year’s notice.

The question being put thereupon, it was carried without dividing. The Speaker having resumed tile chair, Mr. Boscawen acted the part of a common friend, between Mr. Secretary StanhOpe and Mr. Walpole, saying, That it was melancholy to see that any difference should happen between those two worthy members, unbecoming their own characters, and the dignity of that assembly; but that it would still his a greater misfortune, if they should go out with any resentment; and therefore he moved; That the House would lay their commands upon them that no farther notice be taken of what had passed. Mr. Methuen seconded Mr. Boscawen, whose motion being unanimously agreed to, the Speaker put it immediately in execution.

The Earl of Oxford's Petition to be tried."] May 22. The earl of Oxford presented a Petition to the House of Lords, setting forth: “ That Articles of Impeachment were brought up by the House of Commons against him, the 9th of July 1715, at which time he was committed; and on the 2nd of August additional Articles were brought up; and the 3rd of Sept, the petitioner’s Answer was delivered; and on the 19th of Sept, the Commons joined issue, by Replication: and, after several adjournments, the parliament re-assembled on the 9th of Jan. 1716, and continued sitting until the 26th of June 1716; upon which day his majesty was pleased to, put an end to that session of parliament, by a prorogation; and on the 20th of February last his majesty opened this present session; \and the Petitioner has remained a prisoner since the said 9th of July 1715and

praying, That this House will take the circumstances of his case into their considerw-tion; being assured that their lordships will determine thereupon according to the rules of justice and course of parliament, and that it wap not, their intention that his confinement should.be indefinite.”

Debate whether the Earl's Impeachment was superseded by a Prorogation.] The lord Trevor, who presented the above Petition, spoke in the earl’s behalf, and was seconded by the duke of Buckingham, lord Harcourt, the earls of Nottingham and Abingdon, and lord North and Grey. It was suggested, That the Impeachment was determined by the intervening Prorogation of the parliament; which being opposed by lord Coningsby, a Committee was appointed to search precedents.

May 25th, lord Trevor made his Report front the said Committee, upon which the question was put, Whether the earl of Oxford’s Impeachment Was determined by the intervening Prorogation ? The dukes of Buckingham and Argyle, the earls of Nottingham, Abingdon, Ayles-ford, and Hay, lord North and Grey, were for the affirmative: but the earl of Sunderland and lord Coningsby maintained the negative; and the lords Harcourt and Trevor being of this last opinion, the question was carried in the nega* tive by 87 voices against 45. /

Protest on that eccaston.l Thereupon the following Protest was entered.

u Dissentient’.

1. “ Because there seems to be’no difference . in law between a Prorogation and a Dissolution of a parliament, which, in constant practice, have had the same effect as to determination, both of judicial and legislative proceedings; and consequently this Vote may tend to weaken the Resolution of this House, May 22y 1685 *, which was founded upon the law and practice of parliament in all ages, without one precedent to the contrary, except in cases which happened after the Order made the 19th of March, 1678, which was reversed and annulled in 1685; and in pursuance hereof, the earl of Salisbury was discharged in 1690 *

2. “ Because this can never be extended te

any but peers, for by the statute Edward no Commoner can be impeached for any capital crime; and it is hard to conceive, why the peers should be distinguished and deprived of the benefit of all the laws of liberty, to which the meanest commoner in Britain is intitled; and this seems the more extraordinary, because it is done unasked of the Commons; who, as is conceived, never can ask it with any colour of law, precedent, reason or justice. (Signed) Nottingham, F. Roffen’, North and Grey, Bathurst, Abingdon, Mansell, Hay, Guilford, Dartmouth, Foley, Bruce, ”

After this, the duke of Buckingham moved, for fixing a day for the Trial of the said earl;

468] PARE. HISTORY, S George 1.1717. — Debate on the Bari of Oxford's Trial. [464

upon which a Committee was appointed to search the Journals of the House for precedents of the Lords proceedings in the like cases.

Debate on a Mot ion for fixing a day for the Trial if the Earl of OxfoJ May 27. The lord Trevor, from the Lords Committees, made a Report, containing several Precedents from the year 1666 to 1716, of the Lords appointing the day of Trial upon Impeachments of the House of Commons. The clerk having read the said Report a second time,

The Duke of Buckingham made a speech, wherein, among other things, his grace represented, That it concerned the whole peerage of Great Britain, to put a speedy end to this affair, because the peers are chiefly liable to prosecutions of this nature. That he would not enter either into the merits of the cause, or into the reasons which the Commons had for not prosecuting their Impeachment; but that it was certain, that the peer who occasioned this debate, had been confined about two years; that unless this House interposed, his imprisonment might become perpetual; and therefore, since it appeared by so great a number of precedents as had been laid before them, that the peers have an uncontested right to appoint the day of Trial, they ought, iu his opinion, to make use of that right on this occasion. That he doubted not but all the members of that assembly would readily agree with him as to the thing itself; and if there were any difference of opinions amongst them, it would be as to the day. That considering the advanced season of the year, and the approach of summer, which rendered the being m town very disagreeable and incommodious, he thought not only both houses of parliament, but the king himself, would be glad of a recess, to enjoy the country air; and therefore he was for appointing a short day, and named the 6th of June following.

The Lord Ferrers seconded the duke of Buck-

ingham; but

. The Earl of Sunderland answered, That no man had a greater regard to the privileges of the peerage, or would do more to maintain them than himself: that he had a hearty concern for the sufferings of those who have the misfortune td lie under Impeachments: that he had already complained, in the case of the earl of Strafford, of the delays of the Commons in these prosecutions, because he thought the whole peerage concerned therein: but that there might be just reasons for these delays; and therefore, to preserve a good correspondence between the tyo Houses, he was either for sending a Message to the Commons, to know whether they were ready for the Trial of the earl of Oxford, or to fix the 13th of June for the said Trial.

The Lord Tozcnshend said, That the Saturday before, when another question relating to this affair, was under debate, the House seemed inclined to appoint a short day; that a* noble lord had made a motion for it; and so he was for the 6th of June.

Tfie Duke of Buekingham said, That noble

peer ought not to bring in a motion made before, as an instance of the sense and inclination of the House; urging, That a motion is nothing of itself, unless it be seconded, and afterwards confirmed by a vote; but that any member of that assembly, was at liberty to name what day he pleased. After this The Lord Coningsby made a speech, importing, That it appeared, indeed, by the Report of the Committee, that, in cases of Impeachments, the Lords have the right to appoint the day of Trial; but that it appeared, at the same time, that they had seldom exercised that right, till after they had been acquainted by the Commons, that they were ready for the Trial. That if the peers acted otherwise on this occasion, it might create a misunderstanding between both Houses, which might be attended with dangerous consequences. That the instance of the four peers who were impeached towards the end of the late king William’s reign, which was much insisted on, was an odious precedent, and such as, he hoped, would not be followed at this time. That therefore, before they proceeded farther they should send a Message to the Commons, to give them notice to prepare for the Trial of the earl of Oxford; and then, upon their Answer, the peers might determine what they should think proper. Urging, that this method appeared the more reasonable, because several accidents had intervened, which had interrupted the proceedings of the Commons, and in particular, the prorogation of the parliament. That he would charge no body with such a design; but that he could not forbear saying, that the said prorogation seemed to have no other view, thann to screen great offenders from the justice of the nation; and that this was the more apparent, from the great struggle there was in that House, the Saturday before, to procure a vote. That the Impeachments were superseded by the prorogation. That this, however, was certain, that the Commons had thereby lost the living evidence they had in their hands; one Prior, one Harley, &c. having been set at liberty by the prorogation.

^ Several peers seemed offended at his lordship’s naming persons in that manner; and

The Lord North and Grey said thereupon, That thut noble lord had been so long among the Commons, that he appeared to be very well acquainted with, and much concerned for their privileges; but that he must give leave to those who were born peers, to take care of their own. That the greatest prerogative of the peers was to be the supreme court of judicature; and as they were the dernier resort of justice, so he doubted not but they would ever make justice the standard of their proceedings. That the whole peerage was concerned in the earl of Oxford’* case; and therefore he was for appointing the short day that had been named for his Trial.

The Duke of Buckinghamt, who backed this speech, animadverted upon what lord Coningsby had insinuated about the prorogation, saying, lW such an insinuation was arraigning the

405} PAUL. HISTO&Y, 3 George 1. 17 *7 — Debate on 6000 Dutch Troops; [460

royal prerogative of paefoguing and dissolving parliaments, whenever the crown thinks it con-▼enient, or the king’s privy council, who might advise the exercise of the said prerogative.

. The Lord Har court having shewed the necessity of patting an end to this affair, said, They ought, in his opinion, to give the Commons a longer day than had yet been proposed; that on this occasion, they ought to proceed according to the rules of equity and justice, and even of the inferior courts, who, the longer a cause had been suspended, by unforeseen interruptions, allowed the more time to the counsel to prepare for trial. That it was his opinion, that the longer day, provided it were peremptory, was the shortest way to make an end of, this business; for if they appointed a short day, the same might occasion disputes between the two Hohses, which would take up ar great deal of time: That it was to be hoped, that if the peers allowed a reasonable time for the Trial, the same would not be prevented by a prorogation; especially considering, how long the peer who lay under an Impeachment, had been confined.

The Duke of Buckingham said thereupon. That he did not uuderstand the paradox that was just now advanced, viz. That the longest day was the shortest way to come to a determination of this aflnir: that let the peers appoint what day they think-fit, yet the Commons have still a right to'demand more time, nor can the JfiOrds, iir justice, deny it, if the Commons sj»ew just reasons for their demand. And as £>r the prorogation, which it was apprehended might prevent the Trial, the same entirely depended ou the royal prerogative; and if such a thing should happen, nobody could say any thing to it; concluding, that whatever he had s&idon this occasion, was merely out of regard tt» public justice, and to the prerogatives of the peerage: for, he hoped, no body would suspect him of partiality to the lord who occasioned this debate.

The 13/A of June appointed for the Trial of

the Earl of Oxford.]Then the question being

put, That* the-6th of June be appointed for the Trial of the earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer; it was carried in the negative by 85 votes against 44. Then it was resolved, without dividing, that the 13th of June be appointed; and a message-was immediately sent to the Commons to acquaint them therewith.

May 30. The Commons having taken the sdfti Message into consideration, appointed a Committee to consider of the State of the Impeachment against the said earl. Several members of the Secret Committee, who first pushed Q^i, that prosecution, being called up to the House of Peers, as sir Richard Onslow, the lord Cortingsby, and sir Robert Marshara; some absent, and others grown remiss and indifferent in the matter, it was thought proper tp supply those defects, by adding. to the remaining members of the said Secret Committee, Mr. Carter, sir William Thompson,

you vii.

serj. Birch, seij. Pengelly, serj. Reynolds, and Mr. Guidott. And it was ordered, That the said Committee have power to Send for persons, papers, and records, and to adjourn to such times and places as they should think fit.

Dr. Snape has the Thanks of the House for his Sermon.] The same day, sir William Wyndham moved. That the Thanks of the House be given to Dr. Snape, for the Sermon by him preached before this House the day before, at St. Margaret’s Westminster, and that he be desired to print the same. He was seconded by Mr. Shippen, and opposed by the same party who had opposed the doctor’s preaching, but the question being put, was carried in the affirmative by 86 voices against 70.

June 3. The Secret Committee met for the first -time, and chose Mr. Carter for their Chairman, in the room of Mr. Walpole, who absented himself; and general Stanhope happening at this time to be indisposed^ the Committee met several times without being able to do any business. This was the reason why four other persons were added to the rest, viz. Mr. Addison, Mr. Craggs, jun. sir Nathaniel Mead and Mir. Jessop.

The House, according to order, was to resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, to take into consideration the several papers relating to the Charge of Transportation of the Dutch Troops, to and from Great Britain; and likewise thfe Papers relating to the contingencies and extraordinaries for services performed in North Britain during the Rebellion *: bat the courtiqrs observing, that the Tory-party, now strongly reinforced by the discontented Whigs, had the majority, a motion was made, That the ingrossed Malt-Bill be read a third time. This motion being contrary to order, was opposed, not only by all the Tories, but also by many of the court-party, who were not in the secret of it; so that after a debate of about an hour the question being put was carried in the negative by a vast majority. This preliminary skirmish had, however, the effect the court-party expected, which was only to give time to their absent friends to come to the House. In the mean while, the

court-party having proposed Mr. Farrer to be

Upon this it was resolved to address for an account of the money'given for the pay and transportation of these forces, and of the distribution of the extraordinaries and contingencies for service performed in ScotIand, .duritig l .

chairman of the grand committee, Mr. Walpole put up Mr. Edgcombe in opposition to him; and the rormer doubting their strength, chose rather to yield, than to run the hazard of a disappointment; so that Mr. Edgcombe was accordingly placed in the chair. This done, the Clerk proceeded to the reading of the Papers, that had been laid before the House, relating to the transportation of the Dutch forces, after the reading of which,

Mr. Pultenf.y made a speech, wherein he shewed, That there had been great sums of money embezzled in this Expedition; that he could not fix the fi*aud upon any body; but that it plainly appeared, that the ?ura of upwards of 2,000l. was twice charged for the same service, viz. for transporting the Dutch Forces into Great Britain. This was answered by

Mr. Craggs, who, in particular shewed the

reason, why the respective sums of 2, 045/. and 2, 061/. were charged for Transports. On the other band, lieutenant general Macartney, who had assisted the lord Cadogan in taking care of the marching and embarkation of the Dutch Troops, being examined at the bar, vouched several particulars relating to the provisions and transports. But nevertheless, Mr. Robert Walpole, Mr. Shippen, and Mr. Smith, maintained Mr. Pulteney’s assertion, with a grdat deal of warmth, and made severe reflections on the persons employed in bringing over the Dutch Troops. On the contrary, Mr. Lechmere, gen. Stanhope, Mr. Hampden, sir William Thompson, and Mr. Aislabie, spoke in Vindication of the lord Cadogan.

Mr. Robert Walpole supported Mjv Pulteney’s charge with much vehemence, and at two different times, spoke near the space of two hours, and strained his voice to that degree, that he was taken with a violent bleeding at the nose, which obliged him to go out of the House; but catne back before the question was put. The main stress of his reasoning was, That by the papers that had been read, there was an apparent fraud; though he could not say, but that it might afterwards appear otherwise; and he could not tell, but that the lord Cadogan might produce other evidence to prove his innocence.

. Sir Joseph Jekyll took notice of the inconsistency of Mr. Walpole’s argument; for if the fraud was apparent* it was consequently real; and if such, it was impossible to appear others wise, and consequently for the person on whom the fraud was laid, to prove himself innocent; but that, in his opinion, neither was there any apparent fraud, nor, if there were, could it, with any justice or equity, be charged on the lord Cadogan, who, in all this affair, acted only as a public minister, and not either as a commander, or an agent; concluding with some praises on his lordship, who in military affairs, held the secoudraok, next to that Great'Man to whom every body allowed the first.

Mr. Ixchmere likewise distinguished himself on this occasion; and urged, That this enquiry

was altogether frivolous and groundless: that as it was the result of party pique and malice, so it had no other view than to blacken and asperse a person whose greatest crime was, that he had real bright qualities, that drowned the tinsel merit of others. That this enquiry was of the same nature with those that baa formerly been set on foot against the duke of Marlborough, the lord Townsbend, and an honourable member of that House; and he hoped, would have the same end. That it looked very strange, that the persons who now appeared the hottest in this enquiry, should have been silent about these pretended frauds while they were in place: but that it was still more surprising to hear them exclaim, with so-much rancour and bitterness, against a noble lord, of whom they’ had been heard to say, That the speedy suppressing of the Rebellion in Scotland, was, under God, owing to his activity and indefatigableness; and that if another general had bad the management of that affair, he would have made it a ten years’ war.

Mr. Hungerford spoke in favour of the lord

Cadogan, and said, He wondered there was so much noise made about a Dutch reckoning; that by all that had been laid before them, the lord Cadogan appeared very innocent; and therefore he thought he deserved rather the praise, than the censure of the House.

After both parties had maintained the conflict till near eight in the evening, Mr. Secretary Stanhope, in order to let the business drop, moved, That the chairman leave the chair: Which, upon the question being put, was car* ried in the affirmative by 204 against 194, *

Farther Proposal from the Bank of England.'] June 5. Mr. Farrer reported from the Committee of Ways and Means, for raising a Supply, That the Bank, of England had laid before them another Proposal, as follows:

“ To the honourable the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament assembled.

“ The governor and company of the Bank of England, having understood the Resolutions of this honourable House, in a Committee of Ways and Means, on the 22nd and 24th of this instant May; and having observed the several particulars wherein the said Resolutions do

* “ This was looked upon as a great victory on the court side; for, had the Tories and their new allies, ’ as Mr. Shippen called them, gained their point, it was apprehended, that they designed, not only to have passed a censure on lord Cadogan, but also to have carried the inquiry further, that they might have an opportunity of returning thanks, to th'e duke of Argyle, his rival in the business of Scotland. Most of the Scots members voted for lord Cadogan; but, though Mr. Hungerford spoke in his favour, yet he voted with his ene-., mies; and the lord Finch and sir Thomas Hanmer were absent from the House that day.!* Tindal.

After this it was ordered, That it be an instruction to the gentlemen who were ordered to bring in a bill or bills upon the said Resolutions of the 23d 6f March, and the Resolutions reported from the Committee of Ways and Means, and (as before mentioned) agreed unto by the House this day, that they do bring in a bill upon the said six Resolutions, relating to the South Sea company, which were postponed, and are since agreed unto.

* “ The Proposals of the Bank ami South Sea being agreed to, three Bills were brought in, upon the Resolutions that had been made, in relation /to the Public Debts, and all three passed into laws; namely, the General Fund Act, the Bank Actv and the South Sea Act.

Act recites the several acts of parliament for establishing the four Lotteries of the 9th and 10th years of queen Anne, the terms of years for which those revenues were grapted, and states the annual produce of the several hinds:namely, 135,000l. 186, 670/. 168, 0031.168, 003/. which, together with the

June 7. The Lords took into oonekteratioo the petition of the earl of Oxford, presented the day before, praying, “ That the counsel formerly allowed him by their lordships, might

be continued to him; and that sir Robert Raymond, knight, and Mr. Reeves might be added, to them.” But several lords having represented, that this last demand was irre-

banker’s debt, 39, 855/. 15s. Id. l-5th, and another small sum of about 27, 317/. 11s. 3d. amounting in all to 724, 849/. 6$. lOd. l*5th, which is the General Fund, the deficiency whereof is to b^made good annually, out of the first aids granted by parliament. And to the end that a sure and sufficient security may be settled for the regular payment of all such annuities, as shall be payable by this act; all the duties and the revenues, mentioned therein, shall continue for ever. With a proviso, that the revenues, by this act made perpetual, shall be subject to redemption. Proprietors, who are willing to accept 5/. per cent, redeemable annuities, in lieu of their Lottery orders, shall signify their option by subscribing. And such, as are willing to receive their principal and in- terest in ready money, shall likewise declare their option in writing.

“ As for the Bank Act, it must be observed, the Bank, at that time, as proprietors of redeemable debts, were intitled to an annuity of 106, 501/. 13s. 5d. per annum, in lieu of Exchequer Bills formerly cancelled, amounting to 1, 775, 027/. 17s. 10d|. And the Exchequer bills standing out, on the 22d of March 1716, are stated at 4, 561, 025/. over and above the charge of circulation which was then due to the Bank. The Bank, by virtue of their contracts for circulating and exchanging these bills for ready money, were intitled to Si. per cent, for all these bills, and the bills carried art interest of 2d. a day, which together made 6/. per cent, or the whole sqm of 4, 561, 025/. of Exchequer bilk. There was also granted, on the change of queen Anne’s ministry, the sums of 45,000l. and 8,000l. a year, which make together 7/. 4*. 0d. \ per cent, upon all the Exchequer bills. The annuity payable to the Bank for the cancelled Exchequer bills, together with the whole charge to the public for circulating the Exchequer bills then standing, amounted to above 435,000l. a year. In these circumstances, She Bank Act says, The governor and company of the Bank are willing to accept one annuity of 88, 751/. 7s. 10d. *, being after the rate of 5/. per cent, per annum, or the principal of 1, 775, 027/. 17s. lOd. in lieu of the present annuity or sum of 106, 501/. 13s. 5d. per ann. In the same manner the act goes on, and declares the Bank willing to discharge, and deliver up to be cancelled, as many Exchequer bills as amount to two millions, and to accept •f an annuity of 100,000l. being after the rate of 6/. per cent, redeemable after one fear’s notice, to circulate the remaining Exchequer bills at 3/. per cent, and Id. a day, the former allowances to be continued to Christmas 1717; and, after that, the Bank to have, for circulating the 2, 561, 025/. remaining Exchequer bills, an annuity of 76, 830/. 15s. at the rate of 3/. per cent, till redeemed, over and above the Id. per

day for interest. The Bank is then required to advance a sum nqt exceeding 2, 500,000l. towards discharging the national debts, if wanted, and to have 5/. per cent, for as much as they advance, redeemable by parliament.

“ As for the South Sea Act, the original stock of the South Sea was 9, 471, 325/. but, as the funds granted were sufficient to answer the interest of 10,000,000l. at 6/. per .cent, in the year 1716, the South Sea Company advanced to the government 528, 675/. which completes the sum of 10,000,000l. for which they received an interest or annuity of 600,000l. and likewise 8,000l. a year for management. Now By this act the governor and company declare, they are willing to accept an annuity of 500,000l. in lieu of the 600,000/, with 8,000l. a year for manage, roent. The company, are to continue a corporation till their annuity is redeemed, towards which no less than a million is to be paid at a time. The company is also required to advance a sum not exceeding two millions, towards discharging the principal and interest due on the four Lottery funds, of the 9th and 10th years of queen Anne.

“ Pursuant to these acts, the Bank, which was in possession of receipts out of the Exchequer, amounting to 435, 063/. 16s. Od. \ per annum accept voluntarily of three annuities, amounting to about 304, 531/. Is. 3d. whereby the saving to the public was 130, 532/. 14s. Id. £ per year.

“ The proprietors of the Lottery Orders, amounting to above nine millions, subscribed their orders at the Bank, and accepted bank annuities in lieu of the same.

u Thus though the Bank and South Sea-had agreed to advance 4, 500,000l. towards the payment of those that should demand ready money, not one farthing was ever demanded in money, except very small sums, amounting in the whole to 471/. 4s. All the annuities, that were settled by virtue of these three acts, were Redeemable Perpetuities, granted at the rate of 5/. per cent, per ann, upon a principal of about 25, 869, 247/. the amount of the national Debt at that time redeemed or reduced.

M In the General Fund Act is the clause that establishes the Sinking Fund, as the reduction of the interest to 5/. per cent, would make a surplus or excess upon the appropriated funds, the act declares, That all the monies arising from time to time, as well for the surplus by virtue of the acts for redeeming the funds of the Bank and of the South Sea company, as alro for the surplus of the duties and revenues by this act appropriated to make good the General Fund, and the overplus monies of the General Fund, shall be appropriated and employed for the discharging the princfpal and interest of . such national debts as were incurred before the 25th of December, 1716, in such manner gt

gular, the same was rejected.* The duke oft Buckingham said, however, on this occasion, u That as the whole peerage was concerned in a prosecution of this nature, he would readily give his vote for granting the earl of Oxford's request, if he thought it of any use to him; but that, in his opinion, all those who had impeached him of high-treason were, by this time ashamed of it; except, perhaps, one singly person, who could be ashamed of nothing."

About this time, die Lords addressed his majesty, that he would be pleased to appoint a High Steward for the Trial of the earl of Oxford; in compliance to which address his majesty was pleased to appoint the Lord Cowper, lord high-chancellor.

- Debate on a Motion desiring the Lords to delay the Trial of the Earl of .]

June 12. Mr. Carter reported from the Committee appointed to consider the state of the Impeachment against Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, “ That the Committee had met several times, and made some progress in the matters to them referred; but that the

shall be directed or appointed by any future act of parliament^ to be discharged out of the game, and for none other use, intent, or purpose whatsoever.’ This clause constitutes the Sinking Fund, and shews of what it consists, and te what uses it is appropriated. Though there had been Sinking Funds before this time for the payment of particular debts, yet a Sinking Fund, for diqharging the National Debt in general was first projected and formed in the year 1716, and till that time unheard-of.” Tindal.

* “You will see by the public prints that Monday next, come se’nnight, is appointed for the Trial of my lord Oxford, and that no less than six-and-twenty doughty members are appointed to manage it. The Lords have likewise settled the whole forms of proceedings. My lord has asked, that two lawyers more might be added to his counsel: yet is all this but a farce; for there is not a creature living who thinks he will ever be tried; for they publicly own, that they neither have, nor eyev had, any evidence, and laugh , at Impeachments, and Attainders and party gambols; and say, that all people deserve to be so punished, who presume to dispossess the Whigs of their indefeasible right to the administration. But since he is not to be tried, the next question is, in what manner he is to be brought off, so as to save the honour of his prosecutors ? I think it will be by an Act of Grace. Others say, it will be by the Commons asking more time, and the Lords, of their party agreeing to refuse it. But as we ate wholly ignorant of their intentions, it is sible that neither of these guesses may right, and that they may keep him yet another year in prison; which my lord Marlborough seems passionately to desire.” Erasmus Lewis to Dr. Swift. Swift's Works, vol. 16, p. 166, Ed. 1803.

prosecution of the said Impeachment having been interrupted for so many months by the intervention of many weighty and urgent affairs, which more nearly and immediately concerned the welfare, defence, and security of the kingdom; it was become absolutely necessary for those who should be appointed to manage the 'Said Impeachment, to review, and carefully peruse all the treaties, records, letters, and other papers, proper and necessary for supporting this prosecution; which being very voluminous, it would be impossible within the time appointed for the Trial, to adjust and apply the proper evidence to the several Articles.

Hereupon, it was moved, That a message be sent to the Lords, acquainting them with the reasons why this House could not proceed on the Trial of Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, at.the time appointed; and to desire that the same might be put off to a further day. Upon this there was, for1 two or three minutes, a silence in the House, the members looking one upon another, waiting who snould speak first. At last,

Mr. Hungerford rose up, and took notice of the great hardships which the earl of Oxford had undergone. Then

, Mr. Boscawen expressed his concern, That a prosecution which the Commons had begun in so solemn a manner, and which was thought so necessary to vindicate the honour and justice of the nation, should, at last, be dropped; which, he was sure, would be a reflection on that House. Here again was a deep silence; and Mr. Speaker rising, in order to put the question,

Mr. Tuffnel took that opportunity, to speak as follows:

Mr. Speaker; I have not yet troubled the House upon any of the Impeachments: however, since I have given my assent to every article exhibited against the noble lord, I think it, in some measure, iucumbent upon me, to declare the reasons why I did so. I am sure there is no gentleman in this House, that at any time more unwillingly comes into any thing that has the least appearance of severity towards his fellow-subjects, than myself. And I can, .with a great deal of sincerity affirm, that no personal pique, prejudice, or resentment, ever did, and I hope never will, influence my vote; especially when either the life, the fortune, or the reputation of any man is concerned. What I did, I did out of a disinterested zeal; out of an indispensible.love and duty to my country: and whatever may be the fate of this prosecution, I then thought and still am of opinion, that the ineasdres which this noble lord entered into, as prime minister, have, if I may be excused the impropriety of the expression, laid a foundation for the ruin of his country. I have already declared, that I have, in every part of the accusation, voted against this noble lord. As to the articles of high crimes and misdemeanors, I believe there, is nobody but thinks there was sufficient ground for them; as to the High Treason, where lay

477J PARL. HISTORY, % Giomse I. 1717

die only difficulty, I must freely own, had I consulted only my private opinion) I could scarce have thought it included in the 25th of Edward 3. But when an honourable gentleman, who was then Chairman of the Secret Committee, undertook, in a fact which the House had already adjudged to be High Treason, to bring that matter as home to the earl of Oxfordi, as the Report had done to the then lord Bolingbroke; when he gave us all the assurances imaginable, that they had living and legal evidence to support the charge; such as it was almost the unanimous opinion of the Committee, might be given in Westminster Hall; and he hoped that since the House had thought fit to repose a confidence in them, it would not be expected the evidence should be discovered, lest it might give them an opportunity of being seduced; this, I say, and this alone, swayed my opinion. I then* considered myself acting, not as a judge, but as a prosecutor. And when that very ingenious gentleman, whom I always hear with1 the greatest pleasure, and to whose judgment I always pay the greatest deference, I say, when his honour, his understanding, his veracity, his every thing was so far engaged, the only question with me was, whether it was reasonable to undertake the prosecution, or not? And upon these considerations I. cannot but think I should have been extremely wanting in that duty which I owe to my country, if I should have declined giving my vote to bring an offender to public justice when, at the same time, I was fully convinced that he had betrayed the honour and interest of this nation.

Mr. Bromley taking notice that the dint of this speech was principally levelled at Mr. Robert Walpole, endeavoured to vindicate him by saying, That though he was chairman of the Secret Committee, yet if any thing was done amiss among them, it were hard to lay all the blame at his door, since the whole committee were equally concerned in the Impeachments. As to the matter now under consideration, Mr. Bromley added. That they had bteu told above a year and a half ago, that the evidence was ready; but that they ought not to give the Lords the trouble of going through the whole Impeachment, since, in his opinion, twenty of the articles were altogether vain and needless. Some members resenting this assertion, Mr. Bromley immediately explained himself, saying, That if the two articles that were for High Treason, could be made good, the other twenty would be needless and insignificant.

Mr. Shippcn, Who spoke on the same side,

said, atpong other things, That this Impeachment had been depending so long, that every body expected it would be dropt; and, indeed, unless the two Articles of High-Treason could he made good, lie thought it unreasonable to give the two Houses an unnecessary trouble about the other Articles, by keeping them sitting in the hottest part of the summer: That, pfter til, those who bad first begun the Im-

peachments, ought to be satisfied with having got the places of those that were impeached; which, indeed, seemed to be what they had principally in view: that the truth of this appeared evidently from the behaviour of the gentleman who was the .most forward and active in the Impeachments, (Mr. Robert Walpole) whose warmth was very much abated since he was out of place*. That he did not mention this as a reflection on that gentleman, for whom he ever had a great respect; but that he was afraid this would lessen him in tbd esteem of others: That for his own part, he was not in the least surprised at this conduct: of which he had, of late, observed many instances:but that he, ever disapproved it: that' if he would have been a time-server, he might, as well as other people, have got some good employment; hut that he rather chose to be contented with a small private fortune, than betray his sentiments: And as an instance, he added, he could never be guilty of so much adulation, as to compliment a certain person with the rank of second general (meaning the' lord Cadogan) to the prejudice of an honourable and worthy member of that House, (meaning general Webb) whose glorious actions bad gained him an immortal name.

Mr. Hungerford then said, That for his own part, he ever was against Impeachments, because he had observed that they generally come to nothing; and as for the reflection made by the worthy gentleman who spoke last, be supposed it was meant for somebody else; [looking, as he spoke this, towards sir Joseph Jekyll, who .sat near him, and who had spoken in behalf of the lord Cadogan.]

Sir Joseph Jekyll justified himself, both as to

this, and as to the share he had in the Impeachment of the earl of Oxford; having, from the beginning, been against the Articles for High Treason. After this,

Mr. Walpole made a faint apology for himself, saying among other things, That he had of late looked over some of the most material papers relating to this Impeachment, and he was still convinced in his conscience, that the

* “ We find him, who had spoken with such heat and force of argument against the qiakera of the peace of Utrecht, who bad been the indefatigable chairman of the secret committee, and had drawn up that able report, which brought such heavy accusations against Oxford, now grown languid and lukewarm in the prosecution, absenting himself from the committee so often, that another chairman was chosen in his place, and ironically complimented, by Shippen, that he who was the most forward and active in the impeachment, had abated in his warmth since he was out of place. At length, by his contrivance, a feigned quarrel as to the mode of proceeding took place between the two Houses, and no prosecutors appearing on the. day fixed for the continuance of tie Trial, Pxford was unanimously acquitted.” Coxes.

late ministry had given themselves up entirely, and were ready to deliver up the natron to prance. But having let drop an insinuation, as if many who followed his opinion in the business of the Impeachments, did it rather out Of compliment to his power, than, to his person,

Mr. fuff'nel resenting this innuendo, imme-

- diately repelled the dint of it, by appealing to that honourable member, Whether he ever ptade his court to him ? And whether he had not paid him more respect since he was out, then when he was in place ? On the other hand,

Mr. Lechmre strongly supported the motion for the Message, and, among other things, said, It was no wouder that a certain set of men, who had, at first, opposed the Impeachments, Should now be for letting them drop; and that this was yet the less surprising, in that the same gentlemen had constantly opposed all that had been proposed for the support of the present happy settlement: but that forhis own part, he was of the same opinion he ever had been of, viz. that the nation could not prosper, ‘till they had brought those to justice, who be* trayed its allies in so scandalous a manner, and brought it to the very brink of ruin; and ibat he would venture his life in this prosecution.

After this, it was carried, without dividing, That a Message be sent to the Lords, which was done the same day.

' v The Trial of the Earl of Oxford put off till the 24tk of June.] The Lords having received Che said message, took it immediately into consideration. The edrl of Sunderland, moved to Allow the Commons a fortnight longer, but the duke of Devonshire said, 12 days were sufficient, and so moved, That the Trial be flirt her adjourned to Monday the 2lth of June.” The Lords Trevor, Harcqurt, North and Grey, and some others, insisted, That the Lords having fixed a peremptory day for the Trial, they ought not to grant any further lime:but the question being put upon the duke of Devonshire's motion, the same was carried in the affirmative by a majority of 76 voices against 57.

June 13. The Lords sent a message to the Commons, to acquaint them with the said Resolution; which the Commons having on the 14th taken into consideration, it was ordered, 1. That Managers be appointed to make good the Articles of Impeachment against Robert earl of Oxford and eafl Mortimer. 2. That the Committee who were appointed to consider of the state of the said Impeachment, be the said managers. 3. That the said Committee have power to send for such persons, papers, and records, as shall be thought necessary to be used at the trial of the said earl; and that they have power to'si t die in diem, and to adjourn to such time and place as they think fit; apd they are to prepare evidence, and to proceed in die most speedy and secret way they can, for the advantage of the prosecution. And 4. That Mr. Anthony Cratchrode be appointed Solicitor to attend the . Managers, in prosecuting the Articles of Impeachment against the said earl." ,

Proceedings at the Trial of the Eare of Oxford.] On the 24th of June, being the day appointed by the House for the Trial of the earl of Oxford, the Lords having adjourned themselves to the new erected Court, in Westminster-hall; and the . Managers, and other members of the House of Commons having taken their respective places, the earl of Os-ford was brought to the bar; theu die Articled of Impeachment, the Earl’s Answer, and the Commons’ Replication being read,

The Lord High Steward opened the Trial, with the following speech:

“ Robert Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer;

* It has been usual, before the Commons proceed, to say something from this place to persons in your lordship’s present condition; partly by way of exhortation to a reasonable confidence in the great honour, justice, wisdom, integrity, and candour of their judges, their peers, the House of Lords in parliament as* sembled, and partly by way of direction, to assist them in their behaviour and conduct during die course of their Trial. — But, considering the many great offices your lordship has borne in the state, your long experience and known learning in all parliamentary proceedings, I cannot but think It would seem improper for me to be speaking to your lordship in that manner. — W herefore I proceed barely to acquaint your lordship, and others whom it may concern, with such orders as the Lords have made, which it is fit should be taken nqtice of thus early in this Trial. 1. Your lordship and all other persons who have occasion to speak to this Court, must address their speech to the Lords in general, and not to any lord in particular. 2. Your lordship’s counsel may be present at the bar in order to be heard to any point ol'matter of law, if such shall arise on either of the Articles for High-Treason:and that you may make your full defence by counsel, if you think fit, on the Articles for high crimes and misdemeanours, as well on matters of fact as of law. 3. That your Witnesses are to be examined on oath, as well to the Articles for High-Treason, as those for high crimes and misdemeanours.”

Then the Lord High Steward, with the Lords leave, went down, and havingseated himself by the table, told the gentlemen of the House of Commons, that they might now proceed; hereupon

Mr. Stanhope* said:

“ My Lords; The distance of the Lord High-Steward from this place may have been the occasion that we have mistaken something that fell from thence; we do therefore desire, to avoid'all mistakes (and 1 believe we might be mistaken^ f i>rWe understood by my Lord High Steward,

“ My Lords;

“ The Commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, out of indispensible duty th their country, and zeal for the'preservation df the common liberties of Europe, have brought to your lordships bar, Robert earl of Oxford and'earl Mortimer, late1 High Treasurer and privy counsellor of this kingdom1, charged with the highest crimes and misdemeanours by' him committed and done against the person, crowri and dignity of his sovereign, the peace and interest of this kingdom’, and in’ bleach of the' several trusts reposed in him.

folloWs :*' 1

. . *

JfThe £pmmoa$ having taken into theie consideration your lordships’ Resolution comaauui-cpted to their Managers relating to the. proceedings pri the Trialof Robert Pari of Oxford and earl Mortimer, and being desirous, as for as in them lies/to maintain a good correspondence with ypdr Idrdships, have desired this Conference: anjd have commanded us to acquaint your lofijshipb. that .they conceive it to be tlip undoubted right of the Commons, to impeach a peer, 1 either for ' High' ^reason, or for high crimes and misdemeanors, or, if they see qcca-ston, to mix bo^h dip one and the other in the same accusation! ' ’

f< The Impeachment preferred against Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer is one continued accusation, ' consisting of high crimes and misdemeanors, and alsjo of charges of high treason. The facts bn which the Articles preceding those of high treason are grounded, are" Ibid together in in order of time, nnd follow one another successively, in the manqpr they were committed.

fttAs the Commons thought this the most natural method for exhibiting the Several Articles agaipst the sqid earl, they were 6f opinion, that thpy should proceed iu t he proof of these several facts, after the same method; since it is manifest that in laying open the course of such a wicked administration, the preceding parts of it give light to (hose whiqh follow; and that the proof of the several Articles of high crimes and misdemeanors, .would naturally lead to the proof of those of high treason.

f‘ Tour lordships received these several Articles of Imppacluneut, ' without making any exception against the form in Which they werfe exhibited* The said earl made his Answer to them in the same order, and has no where in sisted to be tried in any other method; so that the Commons are surprised to find a stop put to their prosecution by an objection, which has never been started by the said earl, and Which your lordships had given them so little reason to. expect.

“ To this must be added, that as the Commons only are masters of the evidence, and daL. upon that account they are best able to determine, what to charge first, and what nett; so they are moat proper to determine, in what me* ' thod to proceed for the advantage of the prosecution, in the event of which all the Commons of Great Britain are so highly concerned.

“ To Which they forthef add, That they see no reason hut that yoiir lordships may as well-invert the whole order of the Articles, as prie- scribe to the Commons those particular Ar-’tides on which'they are first to proceed, which; will necessarily produce such a confusion, both m the facts and evidence, as is by no means consistent with that clearness and' perspicuity,

|n which the Commons think this affair ought to appear.

* ‘-The Commons, upon examining Precedents, do find divers precedents of Impeachments for high treason; and other high crimes; and misdemeanors, in the same accusation; and do not find that the Lords ever objected to such proceeding, or ever1 gave judgment upon buy particular Article of Impeachmefit, before ' the Commons had gone through, and concluded their evidence upofi all the Articles, or so many of them as they thought fit; and the Commons are at as great a loss to conceive w'hat arguments, or precedents, can be brought fo support the Resolution of your lordships, to give judgment upon one part of the same accusation *, ; reserving the other part for a subsequent trial! as they are to know what your lordships mean, by admitting the Commons to pfoceed upon the Articles of high crimes and misdemeanors, after the judgment is given upon the articles for high treason, supposing the judgment proper ’’ for high treason should be given against the said earl. ., 9, ,

“ For these reasons, the Commons assert it as their undoubted right, to proceed on the prial of Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, after the method fh which their managers were proceeding, - when interrupted by ypur lordships’ Resolution.* '

The lords* esoheto adhere to their former Resolution, ] The Lords having, the same afternoon, taken into consideration what was offered to them by the Commons at the said Conference, it was moved, and the question put, '

“ That their lordships do adhere to their Resolution, not to admit the Commons to proceed to make good the Articles for high crimes and misdemeanors, till judgment be first given upon the Articles for high treason ; n which v^a* carried in the affirmative. Then another motion was made, and the question put,

‘j That the Lords do ^ive to the Commons the Reasons for their lordships adhering to their ' former Resolution This was also carried in the affirmative:and a Committee of lords was appointed to draw up the s«*id Reasons; not- . withstanding the opposition made thereto by t|ie lord Harcourt, and other peers; wfiq

The LortU »'Heatons insisting that the

Commons shall not proceed on the other Articles till Judgment is given on those for Treason.] June 38. Xhe Lords seat a Message to the Commons, desiring them to continue sitting for some time; with which the Commons Laying readily complied, another Message was, soon after, sent to them from the Lords, to desire a present Conference in the Painted Chamber, upon the subject matter of the last Conference. The Copunons agreed also to this Conference, wherein the Lords delivered their Reasons for adhering to their Resolution, to ti>e managers of the Commons viz.

“ Their Lordships, in order to preserve a good correspondence vrith the House of Commons, -(which they shall always endeavour to do as far as lies in their power) have desired this Conference upon the subject matter of the last Conference: and have directed us to acquaint you, that their lordships judge it a right inherent m every court of justice, to order and direct such methods . of proceeding ', as such .court shall think fit to be observed in all1 causes. depending before them, which can have uo influence to the prejudice of justice; and, where such methods of proceeding are hot’ otherwise settled by any positive rule. The wer of judicature on all impeachments, ing a right unquestionably inherent in their lordships, and it hot being determined by any positive role, whether the House of Commohs may proceed to make good the several Articles exhibited for misdemeanours, in such order as they shall think fit, before they- proceed to make good the Articles exhibited for high treason; and there being no precedent where the Commons, qpon the trial of any such impeachment, attempted to proceed in the first place, to. make good apy of the Articles contained in such impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors; their lordships, considering the nature of the impeachment now depending before them, and the method whprein the managers for the House of Commons were beginning to proceed Upon the trial, to make good the first Article thereof, which is a charge for high crimes and misdemeanours oply; and also considering the very different methods of proceeding on an Impeachment of a peer for piglt' treason, as well before as upon the trial thereof, and the circumstances attending such a trial, thought themselves obliged to pome to their resolution communicated to thp Commons pp the 34th instant, as well for doing justice in the cusp depending before them* as for the preventing a new precedent to he made on this trial; in consequence whereof, a new and 'unjustifiable form of proceeding against a peer upon an impeachment for high treason qpd high crimes, might be introduced at his trial lipon those Articles in which be is charged for high crimes and misdemeanours only; to the of the ppetage 9f Britain ip all

times to come, viz. The trying A Ar-

ticles for high primes apd misdemeanours without the bar, the detaining in custody a peer so accused, and repeated commitments pfliirn to the Tower, during the time of sptfo trial, md isnbjecting a peer to as ignominious circumstances on his trial on articles for misdemeanours as if he was then pn his trip! p; i (artiples for high treason; whereas a peer on hip trial, on articles for misdemeanours only, ought not to be deprived of his liberty, nor sequestered from parliament, and i? entitled to the privilege of sitting within the hair during the whole time of his trial; ip pH which particulars the known rule of proceedings in such cases may be evaded, should a peer he brought to his trial on several articles exhibited. against him for high crimes and misdemeanours; and for high treason mixed together, and the Commons be admitted to proceed to make good the Articles for high crimes and misdemeanours, before judgment be given upon the articles for high treason. Their lordships hevp fully considered the matters offered to them by i the House of Commons at the last conference relating to the proceedings against Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer; and their lordships are fully satisfied, tjiat the resolution they have taken and communicated to the Commons ph the 24th instant, is just and reasonable? and that the House of Commons are up? put. under any real inconvenience thereby, in carrying on their present prosecution. Their lordr ships have commanded u& to let you know, that they do insist on their said Resolution, viz. That the Commons be not admitted to proceed in prder to make good the Articles against Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, for high crimes and misdemeanours, till judgment pe first given upon the Articles for high treason.’ '

A Tree Conference thereupon desired by the Commons, but refused by the Lords.’] Mr* Car.-.-

ter having reported the above Reasons $o the House of Commons, they resolved M> take them immediately into consideration. Then a. Message was sent from the Lords, to acquaint, the Commons, That they iipd ordered the pari, of Oxford tp be brought to tbp bpr of their House in Westminster-Hall, at eleven the next morning, in order to proceed farther on the' Trial of the said ea|i. The Commons thereupon sent Mr. Yonge to the Lords to desire that their .lordships would continue sitting for. some time, which the Lords having readily agreed to, the Commons took their lordships' Reasons into consideration, and then resolved,

4 That a Free Conference be desired with the Lords upon the subject matter of (be last Conference."

June 39. The Lords took the desire of the

Commons, of a Free Conference, into consideration; and, after a long debate, it’ was resolved, That aa the subject matter of thp last Conference, concerned a point of judicature determined by their lordships after the > trial beg#], their lordships did opt think fit tp 1

give a fife Conference on the subject matter of the said Conference, as was desired by the House of Commons.* '

The Lords would have sent that evening a Message to the Commons, to acquaint them with this Resolution; but the Commons having timely notice of it, immediately adjourned till the 1st of July. The Lords having on that day sent a message to the Commons, to acquaint them with the said Resolution, and withal, That their lordships had ordered Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, to be brought to the bar of their House in Westminster-hall that very Monday at eleven in the forenoon, in order to proceed farther on the Trial of the said ear); the Commons thereupon ordered the Serjeant at Arms to summon their members, which done, it was resolved, nem. con. That a Conference be desired with

the Lords open the subject matter of their lordships* message, relating to the Free Conference desired by this House; and it was ordered that the Managers immediately to draw up Reasons to be offered to the Lords at the said Conference. At the same time a Message was sent from the Commons to the Lords, by Mr. Gibbon, to desire their lordships to defer their going into Westminster-hall for sometime; and Mr. Carter having, from the managers, reported the Reasons by them drawn up, the same were agreed to, and Mr. Crags* was sent to the Lords to desire the said Conference. Some time after Mr. Gibbon reported, That the Lords would defer gding into Westminster-hall for a while, as was desired by the Commons; and Mr. Craggs reported also, That their lordships agreed to a Conference, and had appointed the same presently in the Painted Chamber.

- The Commona* Reasons for desiring a Tree Conference.] . Hereupon the Managers of the Commons went to the said Conference, and being returned, Mr. Carter reported, that they had delivered the Reasons directed by the House to the Lords, as follows:

“ The Commons having taken into consideration your lordships* Message, viz. That your lordships did not think fit to give a Free Con- ference on the subject matter of the last Conference, as was desired by the Commons; and they being still desirous, to the utmqst of their power, to preserve a good correspondence with , your lordships, have asked this Conference; and have commanded us to acquaint your lordships, that they are verymuch surprised to find your lordships deny a Free Conference, after your lordships have'already agreed to a Conference desired by the Commons on the same subject matter; and after your lordships have on your parts also desired a Conference upon the same subject: That Free Conferences are the most antient.and established methods, for adjusting the differences that havfe at any time arisen between the two Houses, and as the Commons conceive, is the only method to preserve a good correspondence* between

them on such occasions, which at this time, is of the highest importance, because a misunderstanding on this account would tend to defeat theTrial of the Impeachment of the Commons: That the Commons conceive clearly, that the subject matter of the last Conference is not a point of judicature, but a point relating only to the prosecution of' the Commons, it having arisen before any matter of judgment had come before your lordships upon theTrial; for which Reasons the Commons conceive, that your -lordships ought not to have denied them a Free Conference upon the subject matter of the last Conference. *

Which the Lords insist upon rfusing.'] Then a Message was sent to the Commons from the Lords, That their lordships desired the Commons to continue sitting for some time; which' being readily granted, another Message was sent soon after from the Lords, to desire a present Conference with the Commons in the Painted Chamber, upon the subject matter of the last Coherence. Accordingly the Managers of the Commons came to the Lords com- 1 mittees, who informed them, “ Thai the Lord* did insist upon denying a Free Conference.’ *

Debate thereon in the .]July 1. Mr.

Carter reported, That the Lords insisted upon denying a free Conference. This put the House . into a flame; and it being thereupon ordered. That the said Report be now taken into consideration, several warm Speeches were made on that occasion, by Mr. Secretary Stanhope and Mr. Craggs, immediately after whom

Mr. Tuffhetlrose up, andspoke as follows; ,

“ Mr. Speaker; I Cannot but think the pro- f ceeding of the Lords very extraordinary upon this occasion, that, after having received the . Articles as delivered in by this House, they . should now come to a resolution, ‘That the Commons be not admitted to proceed upon ‘ the high crimes and misdemeanours, till judg-1 inent be first given upon the Articles for high ‘ treason.’ And 'here, though unwillingly, I must observe, that the expression made use of in their lordships* Message to the Commons, to me seems very unsuitable to that candour which they have so remarkably shewn upon all occasions, and. from whence this House might reasonably expect a more becoming treatment. There is another thing which I cannot but take notice of, which is, that after having had Conferences with the Commons on this subject, they should -now refuse a Free Conference, which 1 should have thought, must have been the natural result of the former, as being the most probable way to accommodate matters in ca*es of difficulty. The reason they give for this their adhering to th< ir Resolution is, That this is a point of judicature which solely belongs to their lordships; whereas the Commons say, It is only a matter of prosecution. And yet, if this objection were good, why was it not equally so against their agreeing to the first Conference?

“ Notwithstanding these considerations, if I

could be of opinion with those gentlemen who think, either that the honour of this 'House is to much concerned, or that it is so essential to the rights of the Commons of Great Britain, I should be as unwilling as any one here, to contribute the least towards the betraying of them. But since I do not hear it is pretended that there are any precedents on either side; and I cad, by no means, think it of that consequence which some gentlemen seem to imagine, especially if there be a saving to the ‘ rights and privileges of this Hotise •/ I should be inclined to be of opinion, that it would be better to acquiesce in the method proposed by the Lords, than to let a prosecution entirely drop, which has so universally raised the expectations of mankind. Theh we should see, what that living and legal evidence is, which we have been so often promised from those, in whom the House reposed the greatest confidence; and if there should be any failure in the proof of the high treason, the blame might lie in its proper place.

‘ “ Sir, I am sorry to find there should be such remissness in a prosecution, which was formerly carried on with so much warmth and Vigour. And I could wish to see that spirit of patriotism, which has hitherto animated thisi House; that just resentment for our injured country, once more revived. Where is now that public-spirited, disinterested zeal, which then warmed the patriot's breast ? are all (hose glorious thoughts and heroic sentiments quite evaporated ? now comes it that those who then felt, and made others to feel, such an intense-Uess of heat, such a lively emotion of spirit, are now so calm and undisturbed r that those , who were then so full of beat and flame, are now so cold and lifeless? is the nature of things so far altered, that what was then the most flagrant high treason, is now nothing at all?

“ Mr. Speaker; my concern is for the honour of this House, which has been so far engaged by assurances of Evidence to support the Charge. I must therefore take the liberty to call, upon those gentlemen who gave them, to extricate us from our present difficulties: and, I am sure, we shall not want their assistance in - an affair where their honour is so nearly concerned. I call upon them the rather, because it is a justice which they owe to themselves, it is a justice which they owe to this House of Commons, it is a justice which they owe their country, their poor, unhappy country, which they have so often described, as involved in the greatest difficulties, as labouring under the most ruinous circumstances, occasioned by the ill conduct, the pernicious ceun-eels, and traitorous practices of the noble person now under your prosecution.”

In the middle of this debate, another Message was brought from the Lords, to desire chat the Commons would continue sitting some rime, which the House agreed to. After this, Mr. Lechmerc made a speech, wherein having

lamented the unhappy dilemma, as he called it, to which they were brought, either to see so great an offender as the earl of Oxford escape unpunished, or to acquiesce in proceeding on his Trial in the manner prescribed by the Lords, be said; That he thought the latter the more eligible of the two, with a saving to the rights and "privileges of the Commons; and therefore made a motion for it. He was seconded and backed by Mr. Hampden: but the question being put thereupon, it was carried in the negative.

Motion for a Bill of Attainder against the ' Ear/.] Then a Message was brought from the Lords, to acquaint the Commons, That their lordships intended presently to proceed farther on the Trial of the earl of Oxford in West* minster-hall, of which the Commons took po . notice; but being sensible that the Lords would discharge the prisoner, sir William Strickland moved, That leave be given to bring in a Bill to inflict such Pains and Penalties upon Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, as his traitorous practices and other high crimes and misdemeanours do deserve, and as shall be thought reasonable. Hereupon Mr. Tuffnell rose up again, and said. That he could by no means come into that motion; for that how necessary and reasonable soever such a Bill might be at another juncture, he could not but think it unreasonable now; when, as yet, it was uncertain .what the Lords would do. But that, however, he would freely declare his mind on this occasion, viz. That notwithstanding he was convinced, the earl of Oxford wa9 guilty of the crimes wherewith he was charged, and that no man had ever contributed inorte to the ruin of his country than he had done: yet, since there was a legal prosecution begun; since that noble lord bad submitted himself to public justice; and considering that it is the peculiar glory and happi* -ness of a free-boni people to be governed by known laws; he would never give his consent to a Bill, which, in his opinion, must make the lives, the fortunes, and liberties of the subjects of Great Britain, stand upon so unsettled and precarious a foundation. — Upon which the debate was adjourned to the 3rd of July.

The Lords proceed upon the Earl of Oxford's Trial, and the Commons not appearing^ he is acquitted unanimously.] About 9evea in the evening, the Lords went down to West-, minster-hall, where three several proclamations, were made for the accusers of the eatl of Oxford to appear, and make good the Articles of Impeachment against him. The Commons not appearing, their Lordships went back to their own House, where the Lord High Steward / said,

* My lords; I shall now state the question, ' upon which your lordships are to give' your votes; it is this, ‘ That Robert earl of Oxford < anti earl Mortimer be acquitted of the Artt-

* cles of Impeachment, exhibited against him

4 My lord, your lordship hast heard the Ques- tiod stated ', what says your lordship, is your

The Lords present were all Content.

Then the Lord High-Steward .said, 44 My Lords, upon the question stated, I am content. My Lords; Robert earl of Otford andv earl Mortimer is Acquitted of High-Treason and other high crimes and misdemeanours wherewith he stands charged, by the unanimous vote of your lordships here present."

Add the- Bari being called tb' the' bar, the Lord High-Stewnrd told him, « Robert-enrl of Oxford and- earl Mortimer, I am to acquaint your lordship, that your lordship is"acquitted Of the Articles of Impeachment exhibited against you'for HighnTreason/ and other high crimes and m nderaeawours; by thle H'nlSe of Commons, and' all things therein* contained* and thereupon*Lam to pronounce^this* Judgment; which I proaoance accordinglyc It1 is cbn-4sidered; ordered; .m»4 adjudged by the1 Lordi

However the Com mums did not rest here. For though $ir William Strickland’s bill for inflicting.pains and penalties on the earl was not seconded, yet, to shew their resentment at this proceeding, they resolved that the king should be addressed, to except him out of the Act of Grace, * which' was, intended to be brought into the House.

The lord Castlecomer moved, “ That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, setting forth the many great crimes of which Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer has been impeached by this House; as likewise, the endeavours that have been used by the Commons to bring the said earl to justice; in which proceedings, the unhappy differences that have Arisen between the two Houses have disappointed their just expectations; and likewise, humbly to pray his rojyesty, that he will except the said carl out the Act of Gr^ce, which his majesty has been graciously pleased to promise from the throne; to the end the Commons may be at liberty to proceed against the said earl in a parliamentary way.” — The lord CastlecoYner being seconded by Mr. YOnge, and the question put upon his motion, it was carried in the affirmative, and a Committee appointed to draw op the said Address. Another Committee was the same day appointed to inspect the Lords’ Journals, in relation to their proceedings on the Trial of the earl of Oxford, and to report what they find therein, to the House.

July 4. The h>rd Castlecomer, chairman of the committee, appointed to draw up the Address against the earl of Oxford, reported the same, which being agreed to, it was resolved that the said Address be presented by the whole House.

July 5. The Commons, with their Speaker, presented the said Address to his majesty, which is as follows:

" Most gracious Sovereign,

* We your majesty’s most faithful subjects, ' the Commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, do most humbly represent to your tnajesty, That in our Impeachment exhibited against Robert Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, we did set forth, That lie the said earl did traiterously adhere to, aid, and abet the kite French king, then an enemy to her late majesty, and did begin and carry on a Clandestine and separate correspondence and negotiation with the ministers of the said French king; in consequence of which it is evident, that great part of the Forces, maintained at the expence of so much British treasure, in order to reduce the wer of France; as likewise great part of the bsidies granted by parliament to foreign princes for the same end, were, in reality, made subservient and instrumental to awe the good allies of her majesty into a compliance with the bard terms dictated by France. v

“ The unhappy Catalans were abandoned; the emperor, empire, and king of Portugal, were left to treat for themselves; the kingdom of Sicily was given to the duke of Savoy, as an inducement and reward to him for quitting the common cause, in direct defiance and violation of the grand alliance, and of the declared sense of most of hf r good allies, and especially of the Hutch, who; to this day, have never assented to that condition of the Treaty of Utrecht. A Shameful and dishonourable treaty of peace was at last concluded, by which impracticable terms

Voi. VII.

of trade were imposed on Great Britain; the demolition of Dunkirk, which bad been addressed for by parliament, was eluded by a treacherous connivance, at the making of a new canal at Mardyke; and the security which was proposed by removing the Pretender put of .France, was, in the likp manner, evaded by a treacherous connivance at his residing in Lor-rain.

^ It is owing to your majesty’s unwearied endeavours fur the good of your subjects, and that just regard which is paid to your majesty by foreign princes and states, that we see our-stlves delivered, in a great degree, from the effects of those pernicious measures, which might otherwise have proved fatal to your kingdomss but as we reflect with equal gratitude and admiration ou your majesty’s being able to retrieve such miscarriages* especially in a tima which has been disturbed by public tumults and rebellions:we think it is a gt eat aggravation of guilt in those who gave up so many national advantages, at a time when they laboured undev no such difficulties at home, and when the con? tinued successes of a long and glorious war had

ut them into a condition of gaining the mpst

eneficial terms from the enemy.

“ Your faithful Commons did likewise exhibit several other Charges against the said earl, representing him in many notorious instances, as a person who had abused the trust and confidence, which her late majesty had reposed it) him, and sacrificed the honour of his sovereign and the good of her people, to private views of interest and ambition.

“ Your faithful Commons have not been wanting in their endeavours to bring the said earl to justice; but by reason of the unhappy differences that have, in this proceeding, arisen between the two Houses, wc have found ourselves disappointed of our just expectation, and reduced to the necessity eitiicr of giving up rights and privileges of the highest importance to all the Commons of Great Britain, or seeing this great offender escape with impunity for the present.

* For these reasons, we do most humbly beseech your majesty, that your majesty, will be' pleased to except Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer out of the Act of Grace, which your majesty has been graciously pleased to promise from the throne; to the end the Commons may be at liberty to proceed against the said earl in a parliamentary way.”

The King’s Answer.] To this Address, bis

majesty was pleased to return the following Answer;

“ Gentlemen,

“ I will give directions in relation to tha earl of Oxford, as you desire; and it is with pleasure I observe the sense, expressed in your Address, of my endeavours fur the security, honour, and advantage of these kingdoms.”

. The King’s Speech at the. Close of the Session.] July 15. The King came to tha House of Peers, and a Message was brought to

m

the Commons by the Usher of the Black Rod, commanding them to attend his majesty immediately, which they did accordingly, and {Mr. Speaker presented the Money Bills, to his, majesty; which done, the Lord Chancellor read a Speech delivered into his hands by the |Cing, from the throne, as follows:

« My Lords and Gentlemen; '

u I cannot put an end to this session, without expressing my thanks to, you, for the dispatch you have given to the public business, and declaring the satisfaction I promise myself in meeting you again early the next winter, with the same good dispositions for the service of your country. The measures we have taken in this parliament, have, by the blessing of Almighty God, effectually defeated all the attempts of our enemies, both at home and abroad; and, as the principle on which those measures are founded, are eaually conducive to the supporting the just rights of the crown Sod the liberties of the people, I shall always persevere in them myself, and distinguish those who adhere to them with steadiness and resolution.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons;

“ I thank you, in the most affectionate manner, for the Supplies you have granted me, and for that constancy and zeal which you have Shown in reducing our National Debts, notwithstanding the many incidents and obstructions you have met with in the carrying on of that great work. As you have furnished me with the means of disappointing any designs of a foreign enemy against these my kingdoms, so I cannot but ascribe, in a great measure, the happy prospect of our affairs abroad to that public spirit which has appeared in your proceedings, and has convinced the world, that no insinuations or artifices can divert you from your duty to your sovereign and a disinterested yegard to yoar fellow-subjects.

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

“ It is with great pleasure that I see the tranquillity of the nation so well established, as to admit of an Act of Grace, which I have long desired a fit (Opportunity to grant. I hope that such as shall, by this means, be restored, to the enjoyment of security, and the protection of those laws, against which they have offended, will have a due sense of this my indulgence, and give me the most acceptable return they can possibly make me, that of becoming friends, instead of enemies to their country.”

Then the Lord Chancellor prorogued the parliament to the 12th of August. They were afterwards further prorogued, by several prorogations, to the 21st of November.

• About this time a serious difference took place between the king and the prince of Wales. “ On the $rd of November/' say# Tindal, “ the princess of Wale* was delivered of a prince, at St. James's^ and the king two days after paid her a visit, and returned ie Hamptop-Court. The young prince was bap* tized the 28th of the same month, and die# not long after. This baptism occasioned a# unhappy difference between the king and thf prince. It seeps, the prince had designed the duke of York, bishop of Qsnaburg, the king'# brother, to be one of the godfathers, and had reason to believe the king was satisfied with his choice. But, when the ceremony came to be performed, the duke of Newcastle stood godfather with the king, not as a proxy' for, or representing the duke of York, but for him* self, and ip his own name and person. Thjp the prince took ill of the duke, not m he acted in obedience to his majesty's command, but as if the duke had done, or at leasi seemed officious to do, something which ha was net commanded. This proceeding sensibly touched the prince, and raised hit indignation to that degree, that be oo oot help showing it; but, as soon as the cere* mony was over, spoke some warm words tp the dake, expressing his resentment at whqg he had done. Upon report of these words tp the king, his majesty thought fit to give a sud* den mark of his displeasure, by sending hip commands to the prince to keep his own apart* ment, till his pleasure was farther known; which he immediately submitted; soon afce* this his majesty’s farther pleasure was signified to the prince, that he should leave St. James’s; accordingly he quitted the palace (the princes* going along with him,) and retired to the house of the earl of Grantham, in Albemarie-street; but the children, by the king’s order, remained at St. James's. Soon after this his majesty’s pleasure was signified to all the peers and peeressc# of Great Britain and Ireland, and to all privy* counsellors and their wives, that all persons, who should go to see the prince and princess o Wales, should forbear coming into his majesty's presence. Besides, such as bad employments under the king and prince both, were obliged to quit the service of one of them. Soon after this difference, there was printed in the Am* sterdam Gazette, a letter in French, said to hs written by one of the secretary s of stale tp the foreign ministers, dated'at Whitehall, Pe* cember 24, 1717. giving an account of thf whole affair, of which the author of the Cwu *

u As I have always bad at heart the security Arid ease of my people, so I never kept up any troops but for their protection, and have taken every opportunity tb disband as many as I thought consistent with their safety. I have reduced the Army to very near one half, since the beginning of the last session of parliament, And lessened them to such a number as will neither be a burthen to my good subjects, nor

(a weekly paper) published a translation. The Letter was as follows:

“ Sir; His majesty having; been informed that several reports, for the most part ill groqnded, Are spread abroad concerning what has lately passed in the royal family, he has ordered me to send you the inclosed account of it. — As soon as the young prince was born, the king caused himself to be informed of what was wont to be observed in the like cases, in this kingdom, in regard to the ceremony of baptism; and having found by the records, that, when it was a boy, and the king was godfather, it was the custom for him to nominate for second godfhther, one of the principal lords of his court, who for the most part was the -lord chamberlain; he named for this function, the duke of Newcastle, who now bears that charge; naming at the same rime for godmother the dutch ess of St. Alban’s, first lady of honour $o the princess. Nevertheless, his royal highness the prince of Wales conceived such a dislike at this, that on Thursday last, after the solemnity of the baptism was over, finding himself no longer master of his temper, he drew near to the duke of Newcastle, and gave him very reproachful words, upon supposition that he had solicited that honour in Spite of him. The king waS still in the chamber, but not near enough to hear what the prince said tb the duke. This last thinking himself obliged to inform the king of it, and the prince having confessed the matter to the dukes of Kingston, Kent, and Roxburgh (whom his majesty Sent to him the next day upon this occasion) his majesty ordered him by a second message, not to go out of his own apartment till farther order: bn Saturday the prince wrote a letter to the king, and the next day, (Sunday) another: but, his majesty not finding them satisfactory, and having besides other reasons of discontent at several steps the prince had taken, he caused him to be told yesterday in the afternoon, by his vice-Chamberlain, Mr. Cook, that he should be gone from the palace of St. James^; and to the princess, that she might continue in the palace as long as she thought convenient; but that as ibr the princesses, her daughters, and the young prince, the king would have them remain with him in the palace, and that the princess should be permitted to see them as often as she desired it. However, the princess, being unwilling to leave the rince, her husband, went with him to the ouse of the earl of Grantham her lord-cham-berlatn, where their royal highnesses lay' last

ah encouragement to our enemies to insult them.

“ You cannot bnt be sensible of the many attempts which have been set on fobt to disturb the peace of Europe, and of these kingdoms:they only pretend not to see, who are not afraid of them. But as no application has been wanting on my part to preserve the public tranquillity, 1 have the pleasure to find my good offices have not been altogether unsuccessful, and have reason to hope they will, in the end, have their full and desired effect.

* Gentlemen of the House of Commons;

M I question not but you are very well pleased to find that your endeavours for lessening the National Debts, have at the same time raised the public credit; and that whatever was proposed for that end is actually and completely effected. This success must chiefly be attributed to that just and prudent regard you have shewn to parliamentary engagements.

* It was with the view of procuring and settling a lasting tranqaillity, that I demanded the extraordinary Supply which you granted me last session. The credit, which this confidence reposed in me, hath given us abroad, has already been so far effectual, that I can acquaint you we have a much better prospect than wd bad. I have ordered au Account to be laid before you of the very small pan of that Supply which as yet has been expended; any fal^ ther issues that may be made 6f it, shall be also laid before you: And you may be assured; that every part oY it shall either be employed for your service, or saved to the public.

“ I have ordered to be laid before you a state of the Deficiencies of the present year, and the several Estimates for the service of the next; which you will find considerably diminished. I rely upon your making the necessary provision for them; not doubting of the continuance of that zeal for the good of your country, which hath been so eminently conspicuous in every* session of this parliament.

“ I cannot in justice avoid putting you id mind, that several Arrears of Pay and Subsidy, incurred before my accession to the crown, ard claimed by foreign princes and states: I shall order them to be laid before you, to the end you may put them in a method of being examined and stated; which will very much tend o the honour and credit of the nation.

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

i(I could heartily wish, that at a rime when the common enemies of our Religion are, by all manner of artifices, endeavouring to undermine and weaken it, both at home and abroad, all those who are friends to our present happy establishment, might unanimously concur in some proper method for the greater strengthening the Protestant Interest: of which, as th# Church of England is unquestionably the maiar support and bulwark, so will she reap the principal benefit of every advantage accruing by the union and mutual charity of all Protestants.

“ As none can recommend themselves more effectually to my favour and countenance, than

SOS] PARL. HBTOltY, i Ceoroe I.

by a sincere zeal for the just rights of the crown 'and the liberties of the people; so I am determined to encourage all those who act agreeably to the constitution of these ray kingdoms, and consequently to the principles on which toy government is founded. '

“ The eyes of all Europe are upon you at this Critical juncture. It is your interest, for which reason 1 think it mine, that roy endeavours for procuring the peace and quiet of Christendom, .thould take effect. Nothing can so much contribute to this desirable end, as the unanimity, dispatch, and vigour of your resolutions for the •upport of my government. *

The Lords* Address of Thanks.] His ma-

jesty being retired, toe Lords voted an Address of thanks, ' and the next day waited on the King with the same as follows:

“ Mo«t Gracious Sovereign;

“We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal guhiects, the L< rds spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled, do return your majesty our bumble Thanks Jbr your most gracious Speech from the throne, and for your regard, to the convemency of your subjects, in meeting them so early in parliament; and beg leave to express to your majesty the just sensp we have of your great concern for the ease of your people, in disbanding so considerable a number of your Forces, and of your care, at the same time, in consulting their Safety. We return your majesty our most humble thanks for your unwearied endeavours and application towards reserving and settling the peace and trahquil-ty of Europe, and of these your kingdoms, against the many attempts of all kinds to disturb them; and cannot sufficiently express our satisfaction, that there jsa prospect of success; and do assure your majesty, that, as you have been pleased, in so gracious a manner, to declare your interests ^md those of your people inseparable; so nothing shall be wanting on our parts, at this critical juncture, towards supporting your majesty with the utmost zeal and vigour, till your majesty’s endeavours for the quiet of Christendom and the good of your people have had their full and desired effect.

“ We have a grateful sense of your majesty’s concern for the Protestant Religion, and the Church. of England as by law established; which, as it has always been the chief of the Protestant churches, so it can never be so well supported as by strengthening and uniting (as far as may be) the Protestant Interest.”

The King’s Answer.] To which Address his majesty returned this Answer:

“ My Lords;

u I thank you for this dutiful and loyal Address: the zeal you express, for the support of my government, cannot but have the best effect upon our affairs both at home and abroad.”

The Commons’ Address of Thanks.] Nov. £3. The Commons agreed upon the following Address, and presented it this day to his majesty:

1717.- Addresses of both House*. [50$,

“ Most Gracious Sovereign;

“We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal, subjects, the Common^ of Great-Britain in parliament assembled, crave leave to express our gratitude to your majesty, for your most gracious Speech from the throne.

“ Our minds are filled with the most lively sense of your majesty’s regard to your people in bringing the sitting of parliament into a more proper and usual season of the year. And as your majesty has been graciously pleased to consider the convenience of our private affairs, in this early meeting, we shall endeavour to answer your majesty’s gracious intentions, by improving it, as much as we are able, to the benefit of the public.

“We are highly sensible of the coocern your majesty has shewn for the welfare of your people, by the reductions you have been pleased to make from time to time, of the Land Forces, so soon as the posture of affairs rendered it safe to these your kingdoms. It is our peculiar happiness to.see ourselves governed by a sovereign, who is not influenced by any notions of greatness that are inconsistent with the prosperity of his subjects; and who proposes to himself the ease of his people, as the chief glory of his reign.

“ We acknowledge, with hearts full of duty and gratitude, your majesty’s unwearied endeavours to prevent the many attempts which have been set on foot to disturb the peace of Europe, and the quiet of these kingdoms; and have the more reason to apprehend the ill consequences of such attempts, since there are those who, as they would be thought to see no danger in them, give us reason to believe that they would not be troubled at their success. We are therefore firmly resolved, in the most ef? fectual manner, to support your majesty in such, measures as your majesty, in your great wisdom, shall judge necessary to procure the establish-, ment of the tranquillity of Europe.

“ We receive, with the greatest satisfaction, your majesty’s gracious expressions and assurances touching the extraordinary Supply granted last year: and will cheerfully grant your majesty such Supplies as shall effectually provide for the public service.

“It is with unspeakable'Sorrow-of heart, that we observe the many artifices which are made use of by the common enemies of our religion, to undermine and weaken it, both at home and abroad; and as we have the most grateful sense of the tender concern which your majesty has been pleased to express for the Protestant Religion, and especially for the main support of it, the Church of England as by law established; so we are resolved, on our part, to consider of the most effectual methods for strengthening the Protestant interest of these kingdoms.

“ It is a pleasure to us, that the eyes of all Europe are turned upon us at this critical juncture, since we have thereby an opportunity of shewing the world the just confidence we repose in your majesty, and our unshaken resoiu-

The King's Answer ] To which the King re-

turned the following Answer:

44Gentlemen;

44 L thank you for the repeated assurances you have given me, in this dutiful and loyal Acldress, of your affectionate support and assistance in the present juncture of affairs. I expected no le«s from a.Home of Commons, so affectionate to my person^ and so zealous for the public welfare.’ *

Great Debate in the Commons concerning the Number of the Land .Forces.] December 4. A motion was made for .a Supply for maintaining the Guards and Garrison ^, in Great Britain, for the year 1718, according to the Estimate laid before the House; . This motion was opposed by Mr.Shippen, sir William Wyndham and

Mr. Robert Walpolet which last made a speech, ^herein, besides the common topic of the danger of a Standing Army in a free nation, be insisted on four principal points, viz. 1. That whereas they were given to understand, that the Army was reduced to 16,000 and odd men, it still consisted of above 18,000, which was one third part more than the number of Land Forces'in Great Britain amounted to formerly in time of peace. 2. That there was so due proportion observed, either between the number of horse, dragoons, and foot, or between the number of the officers and soldiers that were kept standing; insomuch, that of about 11.000/. which the pay of a reduced regiment of foot amounts to, near 7,000l. goes towards the pay of the officers, and 4000/. only to the private soldiers. 3. That the keeping up so great a number of officers, was, in effect, the maintaining of an army almost double of what was intended, since the soldiers that were wanting to complete the, companies and regiments, might be raised with a drum in twice four and twenty hours. 4. That the pay of general officers, which amounted to above 20,000l. was an expence altogether needless, and unprecedented in time of peace. All these particulars Mr. Walpole enlarged upon, and made good his assertions by proper vouchers.

Mr. Craggsf secretary at war, answered Mr. Walpole. He said, That in all wise governments, the security of the state is the rule chiefly to be regarded; and that his majesty, both in the augmentation and the reduction of his forces, had not only consulted the safety, but likewise the ease of his people. That. though, as was suggested, the nation paid at present near 18,000 men, yet there were only 16, 347 who could give any jealousy, unless some people should think our liberties in danger, from the chaplains, surgeons, widows of officers, and such harmless, inoffensive persons, who were included in the first number:That therefore there are not much above 4,000 men more now in Great Britain than there were kept up

after the Peace of Ryswick, which number-must be thought very.moderate by all who wisb well to the present happy Settlement, considering that the embers of an unnatural Rebellion, lately extinguished, were still warm, and the discontents industriously fomented by tha enemies of the government; That Che parliament had ever contented themselves with fixing the number of the Foices that were thought necessary to he maintained, but had left to the crown the manner of reducing and modelling that number; and therefore, if they should . now do otherwise, it w mid he but an indifferent retain to that gracious and tender regard which, on all occasions, las majesty has sl-ewn to the security and ease of his subject. That after all, it is no less a piece of justice than matter of prudence, to keep up as great a number of officers as possible; for, besides the occasion'* hiph the nation may have for them for the furure, it is but reasonable to acknowledge the ppst eminent services of gentlemen, who having been brought up to no other trade but war, had no other way to subsist and pro* vide for themselves and families.

. Mr. Craggs was Lacked by Mr. Aislabie, Mr. Hampden, Mr. John Smith, Mr. Coventry, member for firidport, col. Bladen, Mr. Barrington Shute, and sir Joseph Jekyl ), who chiefly insisted oh the necessity of keeping up 16, 00ft men at least, one year longer.

Sir David Dalrymple was of the same opinion, and to that purpose urged, That the discontents run still as high in Scotland as before the late Rebellion; for which he alledggd several reasons.

Mr. Walpole, Mr. Bromley, Mr. Freeman, -general Erie, and some other gentlemen, were of opinion. That 12,000 men were, sufficient; and the debate having lasted till a quarter past six, the question was going to be put whether the number shpuld 16 or 12,000?' When, Mr. Ship pen made the following speech:

44 Mr. Speaker; I congratulate tile honourable person below (general Lutnle^) on his being restored to the good opinion o.f the learned gentleman who spoke last: (sir Joseph Jekyll) for it is not long since he (see p. 467) complimented, I will not say flattered, another at the ex pence of that honourable person, and most of the general officers in this kingdom.

“ But as to the question before us, it is my misfortune to differ from that learned gentleman in all he hath advanced, which, when stripped of some excursions, may be reduced to. these two propositions:‘ 1. That the only danger of continuing the Aimy is the Expense of it. 2. That we ought to coolly with tha number of Forces proposed, because it is de- tuanded by the king, who is the best judge of our necessities. *

441 do not object to the first reason, that the hrase is ambiguous, and that it is difficult to now what lie means by the Danger of the Expence; but, if I understand him, the answer is obvious. For though the Expence is doubtless a (natter highly deserving the consideration

* 07] PARL. HISTORY, 4 Gtoad* L 1*17 [50 *

•f this House, whose business end duty it is to dispose of the public money with the utmost frugality; yet it is by no means the chief, or only argument against keeping up an Army in time of peace. The chief argument, with great submission, is, That the civil and military power cannot long subsist together; that a Standing Army in time of peace will necessarily impede the free execution of the laws of the land. A nd it is therefore very extraordinary that the expence should be thought the only danger, to U9e his own terms, of a Standing Army, by a person whose profession and present station oblige him to make chose laws his first care; and that it should be urged as such in this place, where so many millions have been cheerfully granted for the defence of them.

- “ The second reason is no more conclusive than the first, as i hope to make appear in the sequel of what I have to offer.

“ Gentlemen have insisted much, on the great grace and 'favour shewn in reducing the Army since the beginning of the last session; and I presume not to say, that we were deceived into the Vote then given for maintaining 32,000 men, because we always proceed with the utmost eaution and circumspection, and because the deep designs of the Swedish Plot, which occa-Wooed such terrible apprehensions amongst us have since been fully discovered to the world.

“ But however wisely it was then done, I hope •ever again to see, either the same ’number, or near the same corps, after some artful reductions y coutinued in this nation in time of peace, on any pretence, on any apprehensions whatsoever.

•* i will not trouble you, Sir, with my remarks on the fallacy of those reductions. They have been sufficiently exposed by a gentleman (Mr. R. Walpole) who is better informed of the secret of that affair, and who, I am glad to find, when he is contending for the service of his eountry, is no more afraid than myself, of being ealled a Jacobite, by those, who want other arguments to support their debates.

“ Our present consideration is, whether there are any reasons to induce us, as oor circumstances now stand, to keep up above 16,000 meu, with officers for almost doable that number:an'd whether, if we should consent to keep them up, we should act, as his majesty desires we should, agreeably to the constitution of these kingdoms, and consequently to the principles an which his government is founded.

“ Now in virtue of that freedom of speech we are all intitled to, I beg leave to declare my opinion, That the keeping up tlfe number proposed, is so far from being necessary to our protection^ that it wilt be inconsistent with oor safety, and an excessive burthen to his majesty’s g.>od subjects. Nor do I thiak it possible any arguments can be invented, none I am sure have been yet offered, to incline a House of Common* at this time, when we. are in a profound tranquillity, some domestic feuds ex-oaptod^to submit to that, which every member!

every lover of liberty most own, abstractedly considered, to be a grievance, and sneb a on* as ought never to be submitted to, but in that most desperate and deplorable circumstance, where it is to be chosen as the less evil.

“ I know these assertions interfere with what is laid down in the second paragraph of his majesty’s Speech. But we are to consider that Speech as the composition and advice of . his ministry, and are therefore at liberty to debate every proposition in it; especially those which seem rather calculated for the meridian of Germany, than of Great Britain,

“It is the only infelicity of his That he is unacquainted with our language and constitution; and it is therefore the more incumbent on his British ministers to inform him. That our government does not stand on the same foundation with his German dominions, ' which, by reason of their situation, and the < nature of their constitution, are obliged to keep up armies in time of peace. Nor is it in tmr least to be wondered at, that his majesty, who hath spent the earlier part of his life in those; dominions, should think sixteen, or even 32,000 men, might be continued in. so rich and powerful a nation as this is, without being a burthen to it. But when he shall come to understand, that the smaller number, in time of peace, would be destructive to that security and ease of hi* people, for which he expresses so tender a regard, he will doubtless be convinced, that thosa act must conformably to their duty and his in* terest, who, as true subjects of Great Britain, are against continuing more troops, than have-been usually thought and found sufficient, iff the same situation of affairs, for the support of the crown and the safety of the kingdom.

uI am therefore at a loss, to conceive how gentlemen can persuade themselves, that the complying With this extraordinary demand, would promote his majesty’s service. For it supposes not only a distrust, but a weakness m the government: as if neither the affections of the people at home, nor the Treaties of our .allies abroad, were to be depended on: which is a thought so injurious, so contradictory to some solemn assurances from the throne, that no one will presume to advance it openly in the House or elsewhere; and yet it is all, in my humble apprehension, included in this motion. Nothing, indeed, can alienate the hearts of the people from his majesty; but soch attempts have formerly proved fetal to princes of less consummate wisdom and virtue. Nor! are we to imagine, that the some grievance is not equally mischievous in the reign of a good prince as of a bad one. It is sometimes more so, because less expected, and less guarded against.

“ Surely his majesty will have no just causa to doubt the continuance of that seal for the’ good of our country, which, he is pleased to say hath been so eminently conspicuous in every session of this- parliament, if wC make the fate of other nations a document to-ourselves on-this occasion j if wc thank, shaft she keepiqgep 1

• larger namher of Force?, than is absolutely necessary, boo dangerous au experiment to be often repeated.

“ Let gentlemen look round Europe, and (bey wUl find, That some of the freest and bravest people in it, have by this very method lest their liberties. They will find, that the civil power was from time to time drawn in by pretended exigencies, to allow and maintain an armed force in peace; which, as they at first thought, and were instructed to believe, was intended to add strength to their authority, to secure them in the possession of their religions and political rights $ to watch the ambitious designs of their neighbour nations; and to preserve the balance of power. Glorious intentions, if they had proved real! But though they used all possible precautions; though they made ft the condition of. their establishment, that the forces should be disbanded, when the extraordinary occasion for which they were raised ceased; yet they perceived too late that their condition was not binding; that they had erected a power superior to themselves; that the soldiery, when they had tasted the swests of authority, would not part with it, and, that even their prinoes, after these temporary concessions made to them, began to think, that ruling by an army was a more easy, a more compendious way of government, than aeting under the restraints and limitations of the laws of their country. And now they wear the chains, which they put round their own necks, and lament the loss of that freedom, which they unhappily consented to destroy, and which could never have been destroyed without their consent.

“ But there is no meed Of fetching arguments on (his subject from foreign nations.

Our own is too well acquainted with the effects of continuing an armed force in peace, not to apprehend every thing from it, be the pretence never so specious.

“ It would be misspending your time, to recount the mischiels which bave from hence happened to tins nation > and I will not run back to former reigns. But I cannot forbear observing what [Mr. Snell] my very good friend near me bath already hinted, that it was the great grievance complained of in the Bill of Rights, * and was that from which the Revolution was to deliver us. King William himself, after the Peace of Ryswick, could not obtain •hove 10,000 men, though be bad then a more enterprizing and a more powerful prince to deal with, than any now m this part of the world. And the proceeding of that House of Commons must be ever justified by those, who have the least concern for our constitution, notwithstanding some ungrounded insinuations, that ft involved us in a long and expensive wav Besides, it is every year declared in the Act of Mutiny and Desertion, That the keeping up a standing Army in time of peace is against law; apd as tha freeing as from it was one of the ends of the Revolution, so no doubt the pre-

serving us for aver from an attempt of the like nature, was one of those innumerable glorious advantages proposed by the Act of Succession.

“ But it hath been urged, That the consent of parliament reconciles aU; and that forces, so continued, are not to be accounted a standing army, because they are intended to keep out a Standing army; which with the noble lord*! leave, [lord Molesworth] who makes the distinction, is a notion too fine, too chimerical fo be maintained.

“ I know indeed it is explained both in the Bill of Rights, end in the Act of Mutiny end Desertion* (hat the keeping up a steading army in time of peace is illegal only if done without consent of parliament: now, this in no sort weakens the argument, as to the inconvenience and oppression of which I am speaking. For though the parliament, in these declaratory laws, seems to put in its claim only against the incrpachoients of the crown, from whence ft supposed such oppressions were more likely to come, than from the representatives of the people; yet the eonsent of parliament cannot alter the nature of things, cannot binder the same causes from producing the same (effects. An army, though kept up by the consent of parliament, will, like other armies, soon know its own Strength, will in probability pursue the dictates of self preservation, and rather choose tp dissolve that authority with which it is incompatible, than tamely submit to its own dissolution, t An ardiy, though kept up by consent of parliament, if it bath no enemies abroad, will be apt to make depredations at home; and I wish there hath not been something of that kind done this last year: I wish we bave no complaints from some of our own most considerable parliamentary corporations, of soldiers demanding free quarter, and insulting the chief magistrates for exerting the power we have lodged with them, and endeavouring to redress thft grievances of the poor innkeepers and inhabitants. Nay, the consent of parliament is so far from altering the nature and genius of armies, that a parliament army, consisting of about the number now demanded, once committed greater outrages, and gave a deeper wound to the constitution, than all the armies of the crown have ever done; and that army was the creature of a parliament which had established itself. But if we were to admit for argument's, sake, that the consent of parliament could make armies iqpre tame and ductile than they would otherwise he, 1 think, however, it would not be advisable for a parliament, that intends to act rationally and agreeably either to the principles, on which his majesty's government, or its own power is founded, to famttia-. rise a military force to this free nation. For the very name and terror of it would, without oppression, awe and subdue the spirits of the people, extinguish their love of liberty, and beget a mean and abject acquiescence in slavery.

, Mr. SlMPPEN COMMITTED TO THE TOWER for reflecting upon the King*s' Person and vernment..] The Expressions in the above Speech, which are distinguished by being printed in Italic characters, gave off* nee to several members, and in particular to Mr. Lecb-t mere, who having taken them down in writing, urged, “ That those Words were a scandalous Invective against the King’s Person and Government, of which the House ought to shew the highest resentment, and therefore moved,

- That the member who spoke those offensive

- Words should be sent to the Tower." Mr. Lechmere was seconded by Mr. Spencer Cowper, and backed by sir Joseph Jekyll, and some others: Upon which Mr. Robert Walpole said, *That if the Words in question were spoken by the member, on whom they were charged, the Tower was too light a punishment for his rashness; but as what he had said in the heat of this debate might have been misuuderstood, he was for allowing him the liberty of explaining himself." Mr. Snell, Mr. Hutcheson, and some •thers, spoke also in behalf of Mr. Shippen, intending chiefly to give him an opportunity of retracting dr excusing what he had said, _ which Mr. Shippen not thinking proper to do, a great dispute arose, upon the question, Whether the Words taken down in writing were the same as had been spoken ? A member having suggested, That there was no precedent of a Censure passed on a member of the House, for Words spoken in a Committee, sir Charles Hotham produced instances of the contrary; and, on the other hand, Mr. Shippen having maintained what he had advanced, it was, at last, Tesolved, by 196 voices against 100, “ That the Words taken down in writing were spoken by Mr. Shippen." It was then about nine in the evening, and it being moved and carried, “ That the Chairman do leave the chair;" Mr.Speaker resumed his place, and Mr. Farrer reported from the said Committee,

“ That Exceptions having been taken to usome Words spoken in the Committee, by “ William Shippen, esq. a Member of the “ House, the Committee had directed him to report the Words to the House."

Ordered, That the Report be now read.

Mr; Farrer reported'the Words accordingly, and they are as follow: viz. That William Sbippeu, esq. speaking of the King’s Speech, •aid these Words;

“That the second paragraph of the King’s “ Speech seemed rattier to be calculated lor “ the Meridian of Germany than -Great “ Britain." ? - -

“ That the King is a stranger to oar language u and constitution."

Then Mr. Slijppen was heard in his place, land withdrew. After which, a motion being

made, and the question put, “-That the Wordi -spoken by William Shippen, esq. a member of this Hom.e, are highly dishonourable to, and unjustly reflecting on, his Majesty’s Person and Government, " the House divided: Ayes 175 Noes 81. So it was resolved in the Aftinna. tive; and thereupon it was ordered, “ That William Shippen, esq. be for his said offence, committed prisoner to his inajesty’k Tower of London; and-that Mr. Speaker do issue, his warrants accordingly." *

Further Debate in the Commons concerning the Number of’ the Land F.] D*cemher 5 *

The Commons went again into a grand Committee, to consider farther of the Supply, and Debate arising, concerning the number of men for Guards and Garrisonsin Great Britain, and Jersey and Guernsey only, without including the forces abroad, viz. the Plantations in America, the Garrisons in Minorca, Gibraltar, Placentia and Annapolis, and of the islands Bahama and Providence,

Mr. Jefferies, member for Droitwich, made

the following speech:

“ Mr. Speaker; I shall not waste the time df the Committee in making an apology for meddling in this question; since I apprehend whatever I can yet call my own to be at stake in the event of it. Whether the Army shall be disbanded of continued in time of peace ? Whether we shall be governed by the magistrate, or the soldier? Or, whether we shall be bond or free ? are, in my opinion, questions of the same impbrt. I think myself justified in saying this-, from the examples of most countries in Europei They were once free; but if it be inquired, how, from the state of freedom, they sunk into slavery, it will appear, that their common ruin has proceeded from the continuance of.regular Troops in pay, after, the occasion for which they were raised was over.

. “ That this island has retained its freedom longer than the countries on the continent, has beeu imputed to its -situation, which not being so much exposed to the incursions of its neighbours, there was not the like pretence for keeping up regular troops. But the preservation of our liberties to this time, is, in toy opinion, rather to be ascribed to thedtte sense our forefathers had of the danger the public underwent from intrusting princes with a Standing Force in time of peace; and also to the measure observed by the House of Commons, in giving such Supplies only, as enabled the prince to live in the full enjoyment of his prerogative, without putting it into his power to affect the liberties of the subject.

“ From the first credible account of things In this kingdom, down to king Charles 2nd’s time, I can find no instance, where the crown kept up regular troops in time of peaoe, that of Richard 2 excepted. He lived in a tempestuous age; he had wars abroad, and commotions at home. The first Rebellion, headed by Wat Tyler, was composed without shedding the blood of any one of the rebels, save Tyler himself; the king gave them good words; they laid down their arms, went home, and were all pardoned. Another rebellion of the men of Kent and Essex broke out, which occasioned the king’s raising an army of forty thousand men* The rebels applied by petition to have their liberties and franchises allowed them. But the king spoke to these in a different style; and told them, slaves they were, and slaves they should be. Five hundred of them were cut to pieces in the field, and fifteen hundred of1 them were afterwards executed in cold blood. This severity awed the nation for a while. But, the discontent of the people afterwards increasing, about the 20th year of his reign, a Parliament was called, and to use the historian’s words, lest I should offend any tender ear, all endea-

* vours were used to procure such a parliament, as would concur with the king’s designs.' Before they met, forces were raised to attend

* and guard the parliament; which might at the

* same time be an awe upon any refractory members*.’ Touching the numbers of which this army consisted, history is silent: this only

* “ Richard had taken all necessary measures to have a parliament at his devotion. Some time since, he had changed all the .sheriffs of the kingdom, and suffered none, but what had promised to be subservient to his designs. He had taken the same precautions, with respect to all officers that had credit and power m the boroughs and counties. So by means of the magistrates, and persons in public posts, he had caused such representatives to be chosen as he bad secured beforehand. If any were elected not agreeable to him, the sheriffs were ordered not to return them, but to cause others to be- chosen in their room. Besides, as the House of Commons were the sole judges in the affair of elections, he was well assured that such a parliament would ednfirm or reject whom he pleased. It must not be thought very difficult for a kipg of England to execute such a project. Experience ha9 since confirmed, on numberless occasions, that by the like ways, it is *very possible, to cause representatives to be chosetr devoted to the court. However, historians remark, that it was in this parliament, that such practices were first used. ' But it must likewise be added, that it was one of the principal causes of Richard’s destruction, as will be seen hereafter. And indeed it is impossible that a nation can see their liberties in the hands of men, whom they have not themselves freely chosen, without desiring to be delivered from such an oppression.” — Rapin, vol. 4, p. 59, 8vo. Edit. 1767.

VqL. VII.

we are given to know, that four thousand of them were archers, and that many of them were Cheshire men. It is not to the present purpose to go over the extravagancies of that parliament.

“ Into what a state things were brought by that king’s conduct, appears from an observation made by the same historian, who says,

* That the king having thus established his ‘ power, and put himself beyond all opposition,

* thought himself secure, and an absolute prince.

* But it being laid upon such a foundation, as

* begat many discontents among the people, all

* the fabric proved weak, and was soon fol-‘ lowed with lamentable ruin.’ When that' king’s affairs grew desperate, an oath was required from the duke of Lancaster, (afterwards Henry 4) that he should cause the king to send home the Cheshire guard, which was accordingly done.

“ I observe in the debate, it has been taken for granted, That the crown of England has a right to a number of regular troops, under the denomination of guards. This is a notion I can by no meaas give into. It was not so ah tiquo.

“ The first guards we hear of, the Yeomen of the Guard, whicU were constituted by Henry 7, being of another kind, were in Charles 2nd’s time. That prince immediately after his Restoration, got together a small number of Guards, which at first seemed to be meant only to add to the equipage and splendour of the court. But it soon appeared, that he had other views: the guards, by adding men to troops and companies, and troops and companies to regiments, were insensibly increased; so that in the year 1677, they were got up to 5890 men. Few sessions passed, but they were taken notice of in the House of Commons, and though money was not asked of parliament for their support, yet they occasioned a general uneasiness.

“ About that time there was a prospect of war with France, on which pretence an army was raised. But the war not proceeding, an Act passed, which gave the king 619, 388/. tor disbanding the army. When the parliament met again, they were told from the throne,

* That the Forces were still kept on foot for the

* preservation of our neighbours, who otherwise

* had absolutely despaired, and for preserving

* what was left in Flanders; and that the king was confident no body would repine at the

* employing that Money, which was raised for ‘the disbanding of the army, for the continu-

* ance of it.

“ This did not satisfy the House, and they came to a Resolution, That it was necessary,

* for the safety of his majesty’s person, and

* preserving the peace of the government, that

* all Forces, raised since the 29th of September

* 1677, should be disbanded*.’ Whereupon that parliament, which went under the name of the Pensioner-Parliament, was dissolved.

* See vol. 4, p. 1049.

515] PARL. HISTORY, 4 George I. 1717. — in the Common* on the [516

“ The new Parliament which met on the 6th of March following, had the same apprehensions of regular Troops. Money was given to disband them, and the Act directed, that it should be paid into the Chamber of London; and commissioners of their own were appointed to see it applied to that use. Whatever diffidence of the king this might imply, I do not find that any member lost his liberty for freedom of speech, on that occasion. The opinion that parliament had of a standing army, appears in the Resolution1 they came to, ‘ That

* the continuance of-standing forces in this na-

* tion, other than the Militia, was illegal, and

* a great grievance and vexation to the people.’ ‘ I shall now take leave to consider the arguments advanced for continuing 16, 347 men for the ensuing year, it is said, That there is n disaffected party in the kingdom, which makes an army necessary. If this argument will prevail, it is strange it has not prevailed for 600 years past, since no period within that time can be assigned, wherein this argument was not as stroug as in the present. During the long controversy between the Houses of York and Lancaster, touching the Right of Succession, in which eadh side had its turn of being uppermost, one would think it should have been natural for the prevailing party, in order to their security, to have insisted on the continuance of their regular troops, at least for a time. There was a Pretender to the crown, who had a strong party in the nation, and the government was insecure till the spirit of Rebellion was suppressed. It might then with aa appearance of reason have been insisted on, That the taxes on the disaffected should be increased, that those, who occasioned the expence, should bear the burden tilt the danger was over. Why this sort of reasoning did not then prevail is obvious. They saw it was unsafe to trust any prince, even one of their own setting up, with such a power, which, if ill apr plied, might enslave them,

M Another period of time I shall take notice of is, that of queen Elizabeth’s reign. The disaffection to her in the beginning of it was great, occasioned by the Reformation in Religion, and the application of Ecclesiastical Revenues to secular uses. Many plots there were against her life, Spain, one of the greatest powers in Europe at that, time, attempted an invasion, and a more proper juncture could not have happened, wherein to have asked for an awny. But instead of that, the greatest part of the forces then got together to oppose the invasion consisted of militia, and as soon as the Arinado was scattered, the army was disbanded. That queen being sensible, that the true, the only support of the crown, was the goodwill ami affections of the people.

* Another argument brought for the continuance of the army is, That the denying ir

* does insinuate a distrust of his majesty, ’ How disingenuous mid unparliamentary a way of arguing this is, let gentlemen judge: for to draw that sacred name into a debate! roust put every

body to pain, who takes the other side of the question, in regard it may be construed, that the stronger the argument is, the greater is the distrust. But this reasoning, in my opinion, turns quite another way, and instead of implying a distrust, argues the greatest regard tp the safety of his majesty’s person and government. Who can answer for the caprice of an Army, when once established? Although no man living has a greater esteem than myself for those honourable gentlemen, who have with so much bravery served their country in a military way, nor shall any man go farther in rewarding their services; yet the common experience of mankind demonstrates, That it is not reasons ble to expect an army should be always in the same humour. Augustus Caesar lived in great peace and security with the Praetorian bands, which had put an end to the Romau liberties: bur the case was different with his successors; for of 36 emperors, no less than 16 were pulled to pieces by their own soldiers. Did not the army here in England, in the times of usurpation, if I may be allowed to name them, in a short space change the government into ten several forms ? What treatment did the parliament, who had raised and supported them, meet with from them ? Th£y beset the House, repulsed many members who would have come in, others they dragged out even by the legs, and at length they were all turned out, and the doors shut up. I say this with the more assurance, having had the account from an honourable person, lately dead, who was an eyewitness of it. This army, it is true, which consisted of about 17,000 men, afterwards brought in king Charles the second. But that prince soon disbanded them, being well aware that the same army which brought him in, should their minds change, might again turn him out.

“ This objection, drawn from a distrust of his majesty, deserves another name. It is aa honest, it is a reasonable jealousy of the growing power of the crown, which those that went before us always avowed. May it not with parity of reason be said, that because I will not consent, that the king shall by his proclamation raise money without parliament, that this is a distrust of his majesty ? Because I wiW not consent to give up Magna Charts, apd accept of a new patent at pleasure, may not this likewise be called a distrust of his majesty? But suppose from an opinion of the virtue of the troops; from an opinion, that men in power will not make an ill use ofit; that those who may be masters, will chuse to continue servants; that men under the same circumstances will not do the same things; and that we should consent for ourselves, to deposit our liberties in their hands for a while; will any one say that we have an authority also to consent on the behalf of those we represent? A sum ef money, a jewel, or other vafoable thing is committed to my care; I without the- owner’s consent leave k in the possession of another, although the person with whom I left it, doea

riot actually embezzle the money, or detain the jewel, yet do I break my trust by putting it into his power so to do.

11 It is self evident that, by keeping up such a number of forces, who may, when they are disposed, controul the power of the civil magistrate, the strength and security of our constitution is at an end, and that we have no other rule of government left, than will and pleasure. The notion-I have of slavery is, the being subjected to the will of another; and notwithstanding the rod be not always on my back, or the dragoon in my house; yet, if it 1 is not in my power to prevent its being so, I am no longer free. After Augustus had established his 8,000 regular troops, the Homan constitution was as much at an end, as it was in Nero’s lime. Although the tyranny was not, by Augustus, exercised with the like severity it was by his successors; yet, from the time his power became irresistible, the Romans were foaves.

“ Another argument used for this number of troops is, that there are no thoughts of establishing them; but only dontinuing them for a year. If the notion be true, which no gentleman in the debate has denied, that the number of disciplined men now contended for, are sufficient to dictate to the greatest number of undisciplined; I desire to know who shall dare to bid them go home? It is said, indeed, the parliament will not provide for them t Why may not they then, as others in their circutn-•tances have done, provide for themselves ? Is It reasonable to think, that men will starve with swords in their hands?

“ I am sensible, that I have too much trespassed on gentlemen’s patience. I shall say no more; but that'bodies political as well as natural, have their periods: governments must die as well as men; ours is grown old and crazy; and though she hath survived her neighbour, jet I fear her day approaches.”

Defc. 6. In a Committee of the whole House, on the Supply, the Commons came to several Resolutions; which, together with those of the day before, were reported on the 7 th as follows:

«4. That the number of effective men to be provided for, for guards end garrisons in Great Britain, and for Jersey and Guernsey, for the year 1718, be 16, 347, commissioned •nd non-commissioned officers included. '

S. That a sum not exceeding 681, 618/. be granted to his majesty, for defraying the charge of the said 16, 847 effective men for guards and garrisons, and other his majesty’s fand forces in Great Britain, Jersey and Guernsey, for the year 1718. 3. That the sum of 951, 766/. 5*. be granted to his majesty, for maintaining his majesty's forces and garrisons in the plantations in America, for the year 1718. 4* That foe sum of 57, 613/. 14*. 7 be granted to his majesty, for maintaining the forces and garrisons in Minorca, for the year 1718. 5.

6. That the sum of 13551/. 9s. 5 be granted to his majesty, for provisions for the garrison of Gibraltar, for the year 1?18. 7* That the sum of 1, 558/. 17s. Id. be granted to his majesty, for provisions for the garrisons at Placentia and Annapolis, for the year 1718* 8. That the sum of 2, 858/. 13s. lOd. be granted for ordnance, stores, and provisions, for the independent company in the islands of Bahama and Providence, for foe year 1718. 9. That a sum not exceeding 130, 361/. 5s. be granted

to his majesty, for the charge of half-pay to the reduced officers of his majesty’s land forces and marines, for the year 1718. 10. That a sum

not exceeding 73, 327^. 12s. lid. be granted to his majesty, for the charge of the office of ordnance for the land ‘service, for the year 1718,

11. That a sum not exceeding 29, 645/. 8s. 9d. be granted to his majesty, to enable the treasurer of the navy to make good the payments, which at or before the 24th of June, 1718* may be demanded of him, pursuant to an act of parliament for completingthe funds of608,000/* per annum, payable to the South Sea company *

12. That a sum not exceeding 581, 196/. 8s. be granted to his majesty, to make good the deficiency of the grants for the year 1717.”

The first of these Resolutions being read a second time, a motion was made that the same be recommitted; upon which there arose a warm debate, and most of the members who spoke in the debate of the' 5th, made speeches either* for or against the said motion. Among others, Sir Thomas Hanmer spoke as.follows:

“ Mr. Speaker; I cannot forbear troubling you with a few words upon this subject, though I can neither flatter myself with the hopes of convincing any one, nor pretend to be able to offer any thing to your consideration, which has not in a better manner been urged already* But I am truly concerned for the mischiefs which, I think, we are giving way to; and if I cannot prevent them, it will he a satisfaction to me at least to^protest against them.

u All gentlemen who have spoke in this debate, have, for their different opinions, agreed in one thing, to press very much the argument of danger; and the only question i9, on which side the danger lies; whether to the government* without a military force to support it; or to the constitution and liberties of Great Britain, from that military force, if it be allowed to continue in it.

<l As to the dangers which threaten the government, I think I am not willing to overlook them. But I hope we may be excused, if we cannot he convinced of dangers, which no man, that I hear, pretends to explain to tts* Abroad the state and circumstances of Europe happen to be such, that I think it is herd to suppose a time possible, when there shall be less appearance or apprehension of any immediate disturbance to this kingdom. The three great powers, those which are most considerable in themselves and of nearest concern to us, I mean tilt Empire, France and Holland *

519]

are so far from being at any enmity with us, that they are all of them our fast friends and allies, at least we are told so; and hear very often a great deal of boasting upon that subject, whenever the administration of the government is to he extolled, and the merits of it are to be set forth to us. Upon these occasions we hear of nothing but the wise and useful treaties which have been made, the great influence which we have acquired in foreign courts aud. councils, and the solid , foundations which are laid for our security. But when, in consequence of these great things, we come to talk of reducing forces, then I observe the language is quite turned the other way, then we are in the weakest and most insecure condition imaginable, there is no dependence upon any thing, and we must even be thought disaffected to the government, if we will not believe that we are surrounded tin all sides with the greatest dangers.

“ But in the midst of these contrarieties and contradictions, I think we need not be at any loss what our conduct ought to be; if we will but have regard to those plain rules and maxims which have always been observed in the like cases #with that which is now before us. It would certainly be an endless thing, far an House of Commons to enter into the secrets of state, and to debate upon the different views, and interests, and intrigues of foreign courts; what jealousies are among theraj' and what treaties are on foot to reconcile them. If we take such things into our considerations, to guide us in questions concerning our own guards and garrisons here at home, we shall be in a labyrinth indeed; and must be compelled at last to put an absolute trust in the govern-nunt, because they only know the truth of such matters, and froni.them we must be content to receive whatsoever account they think fit to give us of them. But the only thing proper for us to look to is, what is plain and obvious to the sense of all Mankind, I mean. When are the times of present peace ? There need no refinements of* politics to know that, and I will venture to say, that during such times of peace, no remote Dears, no arguments drawn from contigencies of what may be hereafter, have ever vet brought this nation into a concession so fatal to liberty, as the keeping up of standing forces, when there is no other employment far them, but to insult and oppress their fellow-subjects. I say there has hitherto been no precedent of that kind, and the misfortune of this case is, there will need hut one precedent in it; one wrong step taken, in this particular, may put an end to all your claims of rights and privileges. '

“ And on the other hand I beg it may tiot be taken for granted, that if we dismiss our soldiers, we shall therefore eave ourselves naked, and void of all protection against any sudden danger that may arise. No, Sir, Providence has given us the best protection, if we do not foolishly throw away the benefit of it. Our situation is our natural protection; our fleet is our protec-

Debatein the Commons on the [590;

tion; and if we could ever be so happy as to see it rightly pursued, a good agreement betwixt the king and people, uniting and aeting together in one national interest, would be such a protection as none of our enemies would ever hope to break through.

“ It is a melancholy thing to me to bear any other notions of government advanced here, and that his majesty either from his private or his general council, should ever upon this subject have any thing inculcated to him, bat this great truth, That the true and only sup-‘ port of an English ’prince does and ought to ‘ consist in the affections of his people.’ It is that should strengthen his bands; it is that should.give him credit and authority in the eyes of other nations; and to think of doing it, by keeping up a> number of land forces here at home, such a number as can have any awe or influence over the great powers on the continent, is, I think, one of the wildest imaginations that ever entered into the heart of man. The only strength of this nation must always consist in the riches of it; riches must be the fruits of public liberty; and the people can neither acquire riches, nor the king have the use of them, but by a government founded in their inclinations and affections.

“If this be true, then of consequence it follows, that whoever advises his majesty to aim at any additional security to himself, from a Standing Army, - instead of increasing hit strength, does really diminish it, and undermine his true support, by robbing him^of tba hearts of his subjects. For this I take for granted, that as there are but two ways of governing: the one by force, and the other.by the affections of the people governed, it is impossible for any prince to have them both. He must ebuse which of the two he will stick to, for he can have but one. If be is master of their affectious, be stands in no need of force; and if he will make use of force, it is in vain for him to expect their affections. For it is not m nature, and it can never be brought to pass, that men can love a government, under which they are loaded with heavy taxes; and pay a considerable part of their estates to maintain an army, which insults them in tb*« possession of the rest, and can turn them out of the whole whenever they please.

“ With submission therefore, the argument is taken by the wrong end, when it is said. There are great animosities in the kingdom, the people are disaffected, and upon that* account there is»a necessity of keeping up an army. It concludes much rigbter the other way; that is, dismiss your army, and give no other cause of suspicion that any part of the constitution is to be invaded, and the people will be well-affected. Upon any other foot than this, what minister will ever care, whether be does right or wrong ?it is not his concern whether the people are easy or uneasy; his army is his dependence: nay, and the more by his wicked councils he exasperates and enrages the people, the stronger he makes his pretence far

maintaining and increasing (bat army which supports him.

“ What I have said, I confess, goes upon a supposition, that the numbers contained in (he Estimate, and in the question before you, do make an army formidable enough, and able to enslave this nation:of which indeed there remains no doubt with me. In the manner these forces are constituted, I think, a prince who would wish to be arbitrary, could desire no more:and if he had all the power in his bands, I think, for his own sake be would keep no more.

“ Of what nature the reductions have been, other gentlemen have so fully explained, and I believe it So generally understood, that it will lie needless for me to dwell upon it. But the short Of the case is this, That out of 32,000 men, 13 regiments only have been disbanded, which do not amount to more than 5 or 6,000, besides a few invalids, which were taken from the establishment of the army and put upon the establishment of the hospital. So that there are the corps now subsisting of more than 25,000 men, which corps may be filled up to their entire complement whensoever the government pleases, qnd that even without any noise or notice taken. For the case is very different in that respect, where the regiments are few, and those kept complete: There if the numbers allowed by act of parliament are exceeded, it must be by raising new regiments, which is easily seen and known. But where the corps are kept up with only a few men in them, and some recruits will always be neces-•nry for them, there if the government is willing to be at the charge, they may keep the numbers up to what they please, and it is im- possible to know when- the parliamentary standard is exceeded and when not. Thus therefore stands our account: In the first place, the public is to pay 18,000 men; in the next place, the number of effective men is to be 16, 347; and if those are not sufficient to exercise dominion over us, yet, in the manner . they are kept together, they nre equivalent to

25,000; the charge is inconsiderably less, and the terror, which is the main thing, is not at all abated.

“ For the taking this dangerous step, the only justification 1 hear gentlemen offer for themselves, the only shelter they fly to, is the great confidence which is to be reposed in his majesty’s just and gracious intentions; of those 1 will entertain no doubt: I believe his majesty is too good to be suspected of any arbitrary designs. But yet there is a general suspicion, which I will never be ashamed or afraid to own; because it is a suspicion interwoven in our constitution; it is a suspicion upon .which our laws, our parliament, and every part of our government is founded; which is, That too much power lodged in the crown, abstracting from the person that wears it, will at some time or other be abused in the exercise of it; and can never long consist with the natural rights and liberties of .mankind. And,

17 \7. — .Numberqf the Land [529

therefore, whatever opinions we have of his majesty's goodness, and how much soever he deserves them, we should still consider, that in the place we are under a distinct duty to ohr country, and by that duty we should be as incapable of giving up such an unwarrantable trust, as his majesty, I am persuaded, would be incapable of abusing it, if he had it in his hands. Those we represent will expect, and they ought to expect from us, that they should not only continue to enjoy what belongs to them, as Englishmen; but that they should hold it still by the same tenure. Their estates, their lives, and their liberties, they have hitherto possessed as their rights; and it would be a very great and sad change, and such as shall never have my consent along with it, to make them only tenants at will for them.”

The question being then put on the motion for recommitting the first Resolution, it was carried in the negative, by a majority of 175 voices against 125; and then the first' Resolution was agreed to by the House.

The second Resolution being afterwards read a second time, a motion was made, that the same be recommitted, which occasioned a fresh debate.

Mr. Robert Walpole, who made the, most re-

markable speech, urgpd, That by the method that had been followed in the reduction of the Army, the nation was put to an extraordinary and needless charge. Which he endeavonrea to prove, by entering into the particulars of the regiments that were kept standing; shewing the disproportion between the foot, and the horse and dragoons, which last were most grievous and oppressive to the country; and suggested, That by reducing the army in another manner, the full number of land forces already voted might be kept up, and yet near ✓ 100,000l. saved to the nation, besides, the pay of general Officers, which he doubted not, all gentlemen would readily acknowledge, with him, to be an unnecessary expence. This overture was listened to with great attention, and particularly by sir Joseph Jekyll, who being* desirous to know what Mr. Walpole had to, propose, to save so considerable a sum to the nation, declared his opinion for recommitting the second Resolution above-mentioned, which was carried without dividing. It was also resolved, That the last of the three above-recited Resolutions be recommitted.

Dec. 9. The House resolved itself into a grand committee, to take into consideration the second Resolution, viz. for granting to his majesty the sum of 681, 618/. which hail been recommitted.

, Mr. Craggs, who spoke first, said, That having already agreed to the number of troops, it was but natural and reasonable to grant the sum necessary to fountain those troops: that the Commons had: never entered into the particulars of the regiments, whether horse, dragoons, or foot; but contenting themselves with fixing the whole number, had wholly left

523] PAUL. HISTORY, 4 George I. 1717. — Isaac Newton* s Reports art the [524

the regulating of that matter to the crown-; and therefore he hoped they would not shew less regard to his majesty, or repose less confidence in his wisdom, of which they had seen so many instances, particularly both in augmenting and reducing of the army. Mr. Craggs was seconded by Mr. Aislabie, Mr. Lechmere, Mr. Treby* Mr. Yonge, sir Richard Steele, gen. Carpenter, gen. Wade, gen. Stanwix, and others: But ou the other hand,

Mr. it. Walpole represented, That the best way for tjle Commons of Great Britain to acknowledge his majesty’s most gracious intentions, for the good of his subjects, was to point oat to hith the means of rendering those good intentions Effectual; that this might be done by disbanding or dismounting eight or nine regiments of dragoons, whereby the country would be eased of a great-burden and oppression; and that by this, and some other reductions, of which he made mention, a considerable sum of money might be saved to the nation; as well ashy taking off the pay of the general officers, and other useless contingencies.

Mr. Walpole was backed by sir Jpseph Jekyll, sir Thomas Haumer, sir William Wyndham, Mr. John Smith, and sir Thomas Cross; and, on the other hand, the courtiers endeavoured to shew, either that the Reductions proposed were impracticable, or would not answer the end intended thereby. But some general officers having said, That for their own parts, if their having no pay could any way contribute to make the nation easy, they readily acquiesced. -They were taken at their words:and the question being put, That a sum not exceeding 650,0001. be granted to his majesty, for defraying the charge of 16347 effective men for guards and garrisons, and other his majesty’s land forces, in Great Britain, Jersey and Quern* v sey, for the year 1718, the same was carried in the affirmative, by 172 against 158. And this Resolution was the next day reported and agreed to, by the Uouse, without opposition.

Dec. 11. In a grand committee on ways and means to raise the supply, after some debate Upon the question, whether two or three shillings in the pound be laid upon land, it was by 164 votes against 97, carried for the latter. Theiw were great struggles to save the odd shilling, but it would not do; for the next day Mr. Fairer reported the resolution of the committee, which was agreed to by the House; and a bill wan ordered to be brought in accordingly.

Debate in the Commons on the the

Stiver, end on lowering the Value of the Geld Coins.] Dec. 29. Mr. Aislabie took notice oftbe great scarcity of the Silver Species, which in-nil probability, was occasioned by the ex- povtalieo of Che same, and the importation of gold; nod proposed, That-a speedy remedy might be put to that growing evil, by lowering the value of the gold species. He was seconded by Mr. Caswall, member for Leominster, one of the Sword-Blade Company; but Mr, R, Wal-

pole, who did not expect sneb a motion, said; This was a matter of so great importance, that it ought to be well weighed and maturely considered, before the House came to any Resolution thereupon.” It was accordingly re* solved,

1.“ That this House will, tomorrow morn* ing, resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, to take into consideration the stateoftbe nation, in relation to the Gold and Silver Coin! of this kingdom. — 2. That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, That he will be graciously pleased to give directions, that the Representations made by the officers of the Mint to the Lords Commissioners of theTrea-xury, in relation- to the Gold and Silver Coins of this kingdom; may be laid before this House, ”

Ordered, That the Officers of the Mint do attend this House tomorrow morning.

Dec. 21. Mr. Aislabie renewed the motion he made the day before, relating to the Coin; and was seconded by Mr. Caswall, * who made a speech, on the various and respective values; which at different times, Gold and Silver Coins have born, with respect one to the other, according to the plenty or scarcity of either, and suggested, That the over-valuation of gold in the current coins of Great Britain, had occasioned the exportation of great quantities of silver species; and to that purpose, laid open a clandes* tine trade, which of late years had been car* ried on by the Dutch, Hamburghers, and other foreigners, in concert with the Jews and other traders here, which consisted in exporting Silver Coins, and importing Gold in lieu thereof, - which bang coined into guineas at the Tower, near 15 pence was got by every; guinea, which amounted to about B per cent, and as these returns might be made five or six times in a year, considerable sums were get by it, to the prejudice of Great Britain, which thereby was drained of silver and over-stocked with gold:concluding, that in his opinion, the most effectual way to put a stop to this pernicious trade, was to lower the price of guineas; and all other gold species.

This speech was received with general applause, and it was resolved in the Grand Committee, and unanimously agreed to by the House, “ That an Address be presented to his majesty, to issue his royal Proclamation, to forbid ail persons to Utter, or receive auy of the pieces of Gold, called Guineas, at any greater or higher rate than one and twenty shillings for each. Guinea, and so proportionably for any greater or lesser pieces of coined Gold.” This Address being presented to his majesty, a Proclamation was issued accordingly.^ '

* Mr. Caswall was knighted during the

Session.

f The following is a copy of the said Proclamation:

Reports made by sir Isaac Newton, Master of the Mint, concerning the State of the Gold and Silver Coins.1 This day, Mr. Lowndes presented to the House, the following Reports, made by sir Isaac Newton, master of the Mint, concerning the Gold and Silver Coins:

current coins of this realm, as paid and received, is greater in proportion than the value of gold is So the value of silver in neighbouring nations; and the over valuation of Gold in the current coins of this realm, hath been a great cause, of carrying out and lessening the species of the Silver coins thereof, which is highly prejudicial to the trade of this kingdom:And whereas the Commons in parliament have, by their Address, humbly besought us, That we would be graciously pleased to issue our royal Proclamation, to forbid all persons to utter or receive any of the pieces of Gold, called Guineas, at any greater or higher rate than one and twenty shillings for each guinea, and so proportionably for any greater or lesser pieces uf coined gold, which we have graciously condescended onto. Now, for, and towards remedying the said evil, we have thought fit, with the adviceof our privy council, to issue this our royal Proclamation, hereby strictly prohibiting all and every person and persons whatsoever, to utter or receive any of the pieces of Gold Coin of this kingdom, commonly called Guineas, (which in our mint were coined only at twenty shillings each, but have been by our subjects paid and received at the rate of one and twenty shillings and six pence each) at any greater or higher rate or value than one and twenty shillings for each guinea, and so proportionably for the pieces of gold called halfguineas, double-guineas, and five pound pieces; and the other pieces of ancient Gold Coin of this kingdom, which by their wearing, may be diminished in their weight, at any greater or higher rate or value than as followeth, - That is to say, the piece of gold now received and paid for three and twenty shillings and six pence, to be hereafter received and paid for three and twenty shillings, and no more. The piece of gold now received and paid for five and twenty shillings and six pence, to be hereafter .received and paid few five and twenty shillings, and no more; and so proportionably for smaller pieces of the like gold ooin:at which Rates and Values we do hereby declare the said respective pieces of coined gold to be current. And we do hereby strictly charge and command all our loving subjects whatsoever, that they do not presume to receive or pay the gold coins of this realm, at any greater rates or values than the rates and values aforesaid, upon pain of our highest displeasure and upon pain Of the greatest punishment that by law may be inflicted upon them for their default, negligence and contempt in this behalf.

u May it please your lordships j

“ In obedience to your lordships* order of reference, of August 12th, that I should lay before your lordships a State of the Gold and Silver Coins of this kingdom, in Weight and fineness, and the value of gold in proportion to silver, with my observations and opinion; and what method may be best for preventing the melting down of the Silver Coin; I humbly represent, That a pound weight troy of gold, 11 ounces fine, and one ounce allay, is cut into 44| guineas; and a pound weight of silver, 11 ounces twopenny weight fine, and 18 penny weight allay, is cut into 62 shillings; and, according to this rate, a pound weight of fine gold is worth 15 pounds weight six ounces 17 penny weight and five grains of fine silver, reckoning a guinea at 1 I.Is. 6d. in Silver-money; but silver in bullion, exportable, is usually worth 2d. or 3 d.per ounce more than in coin and if, at a inedium, such bullion of standard-allay, be valued at 5s. 4f d. per ouiice, a pound weight of fine gold will be worth but 14 lb. wt. 11 oz. 12 dwt. 9 gr. of fine silver in bullion; and, at this rate, a guinea is worth but so much silver as would mnke 208rf. When ships are lading for the East-Indies, the demand of silver, for exportation, raises the price to 5s. 6d. or 5s. 8 d. per ounce, or above; .but I consider not those extraordinary cases.

“ A Spanish pistole was coined for 32 rials, or four pieces of eight rials, usually called pieces of eight, and is of equal allay, and the sixteenth-part of the weight thereof; and a Doppio Moeda of Portugal was coined for ten crusados of Silver, and is of equal allay, and the sixteenth-part of the weight' thereof t Gold is therefore in Spain and Portugal of sixteen times more Value than Silver of equal weight and allay, according to the standard of those kingdoms; at which rate, a guinea is mirth 22s. 1 but this high price keeps their Gold at home, in good plenty, and carries away the Spanish Silver into all Europe; so that at home they make their payments in Gold, and will not pay in Silver without a premium:upon the coming in of a Plate fleet the premium ceases, or is but small; but as their Silver goes away, and becomes scarce, the premium increases, and is most commonly about six per cent, ; which being abated, a guinea becomes worth about 20s. Od. in Spain and Portugal.

“ In France, a pound weight of fine Gold is reckoned worth 15 pounds weight of fine silver» in raising or falling their money, their king’s edicts have sometimes varied a little from this proportion in excess, or defect; but the variations have been so little, that I do not here consider them:by the edict of May 1709, a near pistole was coined for fonr new lewisses, and is of equal allay, and 'the fifteenth-part of the weight thereof, except the errors of their mintsy and, by the same edict, fine Gold is valued af 15 times its weight of fine Silver; and, at -tibia

$27] PARL. HISTORY, 4 GeorgiI. 1717. — Sir Isaac Newton’s Reports the [526

Irate, a guinea is worth 20s. 8:I consider

not here the confusion made in the monies in France^ by frequent edicts to send them to the Mint, and give the king a tax out of them: I consider only the value of Gold and Silver in proportion to one another.

“ The ducats of Holland, and Hungary, and the empire, were lately current in Holland, among the common people, in their markets, and ordinary affairs, at five guilders in specie, and five stivers; and'commonly changed for so much Silver-monies in three-guilder pieces and guilder-pieces, as guineas are with us for 21r. 6d> sterling; at which rate, a guinea is worth 80s. 7 \d.

“ According to the rates of Gold to Silver in Italy, Germany, Poland, Denmark, and Sweden, a guinea is worth, about 20*. and 7 5d. or 4 d.for the proportion varies a little within the several governments in those countries. In Sweden, gold is lowest in proportion to silver, and this hath made that kingdom, which formerly was content with copper money, abound of late with silver, sent thither (I suspect) for naval stores.

“ In the end of king William's reign, and the first, year of the late queen, when foreign coins abounded in England, I caused a great many of them to be assayed in the mint; and found by the assays, that fine gold was to fine silver in Spain, Portugal, France, Holland, Italy, Germany, and the northern kingdoms, in the proportions above-mentioned, errors of the mints excepted.

“ In China and Japan, one pound weight of fine gold is worth but nine or ten pounds weight of fine silver; and in East-India it may be worth twelve: and this low price of gold in proportion to silver carries away the silver from all Europe.

“ So then, by the course of trade and exchange between nation and nation in all Europe, fine gold is to fine silver as 14f-, or 15, to one; and a guinea, at the same rate, is worth between 20 s.5d. and 20s. 8; except in extraordinary cases, as when a Plate fleet is just arrived in Spain; or ships are lading here for the East Indies; which cases I do not here'eon-sider: And it appears by experience, as well as by reason, that silver flows from those places, where its value is lowest in proportion to gold, as from Spain to all Europe, and from all Europe to the East-Indies, China, and Japan; and that gold is most plentiful in those places, in which its value is highest in proportion to silver, as in Spain and England.

“ It is the demand for exportation which hath raised the price of exportable silver about 3d. or 3d. in the ounce above that of silver in coin, and hath thereby created a temptation to export, or melt down, the silver coin, rather than give 2d. or 3d. more for foreign silver; ' and the demand for exportation arises from the higher price of silver in other places than in England in proportion to gold; that is, from the higher price of gold in England than in •Iber places in proportion to silver; and there-

fore may be diminished, by lowering the value of gold in proportion to silver: If gold in England, or silver in East-India, could 'be brought down so low as to bear the same proportion to one another in both places, there would be here no greater demand for silver, than fitr gold to be exported to India; and if gold were lowered only 90 as to have the same proportion to the silver money in England which it hath to silver in the rest of Europe, there would be no temptation to export silver rather than gold to any other part of Europe: And to compass this last, there seems nothing more requisite than to take off about 10 d.or 12 from the guinea; so that gold may bear thfe same proportion to the silver money in England, which it ought to do by the coarse of trade and exchange in Europe; but if only 6 d.werq taken off at present, it would diminish the temptation to export, or melt down, the silver coin; and, by the effects, would shew hereafter, better titan can appear at present, what further reduction would be most convenient for the public.

“ In the last year of king William, the dollars of Scotland, worth about 4*. 6\d. were put away in the North of England for 5s. and at this price began to flow in upon us: I gave notice thereof to the lords commissioners of the treasury; and they ordered the collectors of taxes to forbear taking them; and thereby put a stop to the mischief.

At the same time, the lewidors of France, which were worth but seventeen shillings and three farthings apiece, passed in England at 17s. 6d.: I gave notice thereof to the lords commissioners of the treasury; and his late majesty put out a proclamation, That they should go but at 17s.; and thereupon they came to the Mint; and 1, 400,000l. were coined out of them:and if the advantage of £</. in a lewidor, sufficed at that time to .bring into England so great a quantity of French money, and the advantage of three farthings in a lewidor to bring it to the mint, the advantage of 9 halfpenny in a guinea, or above, may have been sufficient to bring the great quantity of gold, which hath been coined in these last fifteen years, without any foreign silver.

“ Some years ago, the Portugal moedors were received in the west of England at 28s. a-piece; upon notice from the mint that they were worth only about 27s. 7 d., the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, ordered their receivers of taxes to take them at no more than 27s. 6d. Afterwards many gentlemen in the west spnt up to the treasury a petition, that the receivers might take them again at 28s. and promised to get returns for this money at that rate; alledging, that when they went at 28s. their country was full of gold, which they wanted veiy much: But the commissioners of the treasury, considering, that at 28s. the nation would lose 5d, a piece, rejected the petition:And if an advantage to the merchant of 5 in 28s. did pour that money in upon us, much more hath an advantage to the merchant of 9£d. in a guinea, or, above, been able to bring into the Mint great

Quantities of .gold, without any foreign silver; and may be able to do it still, till the cause be removed. s

“ If things be let alone till silver money be a little scarcer, the gold will fall of itself; for people are already backward to give silver for gold, and will, in a little time, refuse to make payments in silver without a premium, as they do in Spain; and this premium will be an abatement in the value of the gold; and so the Question is, Whether gold shall be lowered by ithe government, or let alone till it falls of itself by the want of silver money.

* It may be said, that there are great quantities of silver in plate; and if the plate were coined, there would be no want of silver money: But I reckon, that silver is safer from exportation in the form of plate than in the form of money, because of the greater value of the silver and fashion together; and therefore I am not for coining the plate, till the temptation to export the silver money, which is a profit of 2d.. or 3d. an ounce, be diminished; for as often as men are necessitated to send away money for answering debts abroad, there will be a temptation to send away silver rather than gold, because of the profit, which is almost four per cent.; and, for the same reason, foreigners will choose to send hither their gold rather than their silver.

-To the Right Hon. the Lords Commissioners of his Majesty’s Treasury.

. u May it please your Lordships;

t(Irt obedience to your lordships'order of reference of the 19th instant, That an account be laid before y our lordships of all the gold add silver, coined in the last 15 years; and how much thereof hath been coined out of plate upon public encouragements; and what copper money hath been newly coined; it is humbly represented, that since Christmas, 1701-2, to the 19th instant, there hath been coined in gold 7, 127, 885/. in tale, reckoning 44£ guineas to a pound weight troy, and 21s. 6d. to a guinea; and in silver 223, 380/. sterling, reckoning 3/. 2 to a pound weight troy; and that part of this silver, amounting to 143, 086/. sterling, was coined out of English plate, imported upon public encouragement, m the years 1709 and 1711; and another part, amounting to 13, 342Z. was coined out of Vigo plate in the years 1703 and 1704; and another part, amounting to 45, 732/. was coined from silver extracted from our own lead-ore; and the rest, amounting to '21, 220/. was coined chiefly out of old plate melted down by goldsmiths; and some of it out of pieces of eight.

’ u The graver of the Mint has keen hard at work, ever since the last session of parliament, in making the embossments and puncheons for the halfpence and farthings, and taking off a few dies from them: the making of an embossment, and a puncheon, for halfpence, tabes Voi. VII,

up the time of about six weeks; and there have been two embossments, and two puncheons, made for the halfpence, and one for the farthings; and now these are finished, and some dies are made from the puncheons, it will take up a little time to examine the copper, and settle the best method of preparing, sizing, Healing, and cleaning it, and making it fit tor the Mint; this being a manufacture different from that of Coarse copper, and more difficult, and not yet practised in England; and as soon as this method is fixed, we shall begin to coin ia quantity.

This day both Houses qdjourned to the 13th of January*.

January 13, 1718. The House of Commons met, and came to the following Resolutions:

1. “ That this House will not alter the Standard of the Gold and Silver Coins of this kingdom in fineness, weight, or denomination. 2.Resolved That this House will, upon Thursday sennight, resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, to take into consideration the State of the Nation, in relation to the Gold and Silver Coins of this kingdomf

January 16. The Lords met this day, pursuant to adjournment. The prince of Wales went to the House of Peers, which being very full, my lord North and Grey stood up, and “ took notice of the great ferment that was in

* “ It was generally believed this adjournment was occasioned'by some measures that were then taken, in order to reconcile the royal family, which not having the desired effect, it was expected, the king would, on the day of meeting, have come to the Hoqse of Peers, and acquainted the parliament with some matters (of importance; but the court took another course, to the great disappointment of some persons.” — Tiudal.

f “ The lowering the value of gold, which was thought a proper expedient to procure agreater circulation of silver species, had, during the recess, a contrary effect, either, as was supposed, through the covetousness of some monied men, who hoarded np silver, in hopes that the same would be raised; or out of fear that gold would still be lowered; or through the malice of the disaffected, who, by the same method, thought, if oot to distress the government, at least to raise murmurings against it among the common people, upon account of the stop which was thereby put to petty trade. In order therefore to remedy this great evil, as soon as the Commons met, they came to a Resolution, That this House will not alter the standard of the gold and silver coins of this kingdom in fineness, weight, and denomination: the Lords came also to the same Resolution, and ordered a bill to be brought in to prevent the melting down of the silver coin, ” — Tindal.

the nation”----As his lordship made here a

small pause, the Lords began to be very atten-live, and some in pain, fearing his lordship would touch upon matters of a high and nice nature i but his lordship soon eased them, by mentioning only the great Scarcity of Silver, which occasioned a general stop of trade, and very much distressed the poor. Upon which, the Lords resolved to take that matter into consideration on Thursday the 23rd. *

* “ About this time a design against the king’s life was discovered. The author of it seemed to be fitter for Bedlam than Newgate. His name was James Shepheard, a youth of eighteen years, apprentice to a eoachmaker in Devonshire-street. On the 24th of January, he came to the house of Mr, John Leake, a

4 non-juring clergyman, and, not finding him at home, left a letter with the maid, who delivered it to Mr. Leake’s daughter. When Mr. Leake came home, the letter was given to him, who, upon reading the superscription, found it directed for the revereud Mr. Heath; upon which he doubted of its being left for him; but being told by the maid, that it was left for him, and considering that there was no such person as Mr. Heath, a clergyman, in that neighbourhood, he opened the letter, and, having read it to himself, told his maid and dangfr-ter, it was a wicked and villainous fetter, and then read it to them, and afterwards threw it into the fire. But, upon considering the matter, and suspecting that some person might have sent it with a design to get his house searched, and fix an odium upon him, he went to sir Johp Fryer, alderman, the next morning,

' and acquainted him with the matter. Sir John advised him to secure the writer of the letter, if he should call*again at his house, as it seems he had promised to do. According to his promise he called again in three days, when Mr. Leake asked him whether his name was James Shepheard, and if he had left a letter for him on the Friday before ? he answered in the affirmative; upon which he wa3 seized and carried before sir John Fryer; Shepheard owned .to him the bringing of the letter; and being asked, if he had a copy of it ? he answered, he had no copy about him; but, if he had pen, ink, and paper, he could soon write one; which he did, and gave it to sir John; who observing to him, that he had not put his name to it, he immediately subscribed it, affirming, that he believed it to be a true copy of the letter he had left at Mr. Leake’s; and that, if at all, it differed only in some few words: The copy was as follows:

* Sir; From the many discontents visible

* throughout this kingdom, I infer, that, if the

* moved, our king being here, he might be ‘ settled on his throne without much loss of

January 23. The Lords in a grand committee, took into consideration the state of the nation, in relation to the Gold and Silver coins.

The Lord Binaley, having repreisented the

great prejudice that trade received from the scarcity of silver, said, among other things, it was a matter of wonder a remedy had not seasonably been applied to so great an evil, which had visibly been growing for so many months past.

* t6 his majesty, I will, on his arrival, smite the 1 usurper in his palace. In this confusion, if

‘ ment, from one who shall be ignorant of the 1 design. James Shepheard.' ,

“ Sir John Fryer committed him prisoner to the Compter, and afterwards went with him and Mr. Leake, his daughter and maid, 'to the earl of Sunderland’s office, where the copy of the letter was produced and read to him which he owned with the greatest unconcern imaginable. He owned likewise, that, while he was at school at Salisbury, he had imbibed the principles, which he then acted upon, by conversation with his school-fellows, who, in the time of the rebellion in the north, wished the Pretender might have success, and was confirmed in his opinion by reading some pamphlets he saw lying on some booksellers' stalls, particularly, A Vindication of the Bishop of

* Exeter, ’ and especially from the- improvement of the words of St. Paul, That persons

* ought to be obedient to the powers that were 1 set over them, although they were tyrannical.* That he had three years ago resolved upon the design to assassinate the king, and did determine to put it in execution, when opportunity offered. He was brought to his trial on the 6th of March, for high-treason; and the evidence against him was very strong. Being called upon by the court to make his defence, he acknowledged the truth of what had been deposed against him; and owned, that he meant it, that he intended it, and did not think

Lord Stanhope answered him, that the scarcity of, silver species was owing to several .causes; 1st, The encreasing luxury, in relation -to silver plate. 2ndly, To the vast exports of bullion and other plate to the East Indies. And Sdly, To the clandestine trade that had lately been carried on, of exporting silver and importing gold to and from Holland, Germany, and other parts. To prove these particulars his lordship produced several papers, and, among the rest a scheme drawn up by Henry .Martin, esq. inspector general of the exports ^ind imports at the custom house, whereby it Appeared, that in the year 1717, the East India company had exported near three millions of ounces of silver, which far exceeds the imports of bullion in that year; it necessarily followed, that vast quantities of silver species must have been melted down, both to make up that export, and to supply silver-smiths. His lordship added, that it was impossible for those in the administration to remedy this evil, without the interposition of the parliament; and as for the trade of exporting siher, and importing gold in lieu of it, which encreased the scarcity of the iirst, the most effectual method that could he thought of to prevent it, had been already used, viz. the lowering the price of gold, ' which would not have failetl to have in great measure, produced the desired effect, hut for the covetousness of some, or the malice of others, who, by hoarding up silver, thought either to make considerable gains, or to distress the government:so that, upon the whole matter, no fault could be found upon this score with the managers of his majesty’s treasury; but that, on the contrary, it might to their praise be observed, that the public credit never ran so high in any other hands, since the government could now borrow great sums at s£ per cent.

The Earl of Oxford answered the lord Stanhope, and made some reflections’, which the other returned very smartly. Though the lord viscount Townshend, the lord Coningsby, and some other peers, spoke also on this occasion,

Jret their lordships came that day to no Resoution; but the farther consideration of that matter being put off till Saturday the 25th of January. It was on that day resolved, “ That no alteration should be made in the standard of the Gold and Silver Coins of this kingdom, in fineness, weight or denomination which Resolption was, on the 97 th, reported and

there was any harm in it, or any guilt in the fact, if committed. 'Upon this he was condemned, and executed at Tyburn, being attended by Mr. Orme, a non-juring clergyman, who absolved him at the gallows, and was supposed to have penned his speech; which being an invective against the king, the government did not think proper to allow it to be printed; and Mr. Orme was taken into the custody of a messenger. Orme was frequently examined; but, as nothing appeared, upon which it was judged proper to bring him to a trial, he was at last set at liberty." Tindal.

agreed to by the House. The next day their lordships resumed the consideration of that affair; and after having examined the officers of the mint, and the roaster and wardens of the goldsmiths company, ordered a Pill to be brought in, u to prevent the melting down of the Coins of the kingdom."

Debate in the Commons concerning the llalf-Pay Officers.] January 22. The House of Commons, in a committee of the whole House, considered further of the Supply, and particularly in relation to the Half-Pay of the reduced Officers.

Mr. Hutcheson, who had already prepared the minds of the assembly, by causing his book of Abstracts and Observations, to be distributed gratis to most of the members, made use of his own lucubrations and remarks to shew, That the Lists of Half-Pay were charged with many officers who had no right to it; and was powerfully supported by

Mr. Robert Walpole, who, in particular, excepted against the allowing Halt-Pay here, to the officers of the 13 regiments lately reduced in Ireland.

Mr. Craggs answered those two gentlemen

with a great deal of vivacity, and as much strength of reason as the nature of the several particulars objected against would admit of; And because it was suggested by Mr. Walpole, That he had not been long in his office; Mr. Craggs readily owned, That he could not boast of so much experience in affairs as a certain gentleman; but this he was surfe of, that though a novice, he would, ten years hence, be of the same opinion be was of at present, and not imitate them who changed theirs, as they were in or out of place. Hereupon

Mr. Walpole, who could not but perceive

that this bolt was levelled at him, appealed to the assembly, Whether, while he had (tie honour to be in the employment, he had not declared his opinion as freely as he did at present, particularly in relation to the matter now before them? Mr. John Smith, sir Henry Bunbury, and sir William Wyndham, supported Mr. Walpole, and all of them did justice to the Officers who had served their country in the two last wars; excepting only against the abuse which had been made of the national bounty, m granting Half-Pay to those that did not deserve it. On the other hand, Mr. Aislabie, colonel Bladen, sir Charles Hotham, sir Richard Steele, general Wade, Mr. Lowndes, and several others, supported Mr. Craggs; and

Mr. Boscazcen, said, That, in his opinion, the

Officers who had lately served against the rebels in Scotland, and in the north and west of England, had no less merited / than those who had served many years in foreign wars, since by suppressing a most unnatural and detestable rebellion, they had delivered their country from its most dangerous enemies. But though the court party, instead of about 130, 361/. to which the list of Half-Pay for 1713 amounted, would have been contented with 115,0001. yet a mo-

tion being made, and the question put, That the chairman leave the chair, it was carried in the affirmative, by 186 voices against 148.

Jan. 24. The House went into a grand committee to consider farthef^ of the Supply; particularly in relation to Half-Pay; and Mr. Hutcheson and Mr. Walpole chiefly insisted, That the Officers of the 13 regiments reduced in Ireland, ought to have been placed on the establishment of that kingdom.

The Lord Viscount Brod(lord Chancellor for Ireland ), endeavoured to justify the ministry there; and represented how hard the case of those officers would be, if they were struck off the English establishment.

Mr. Walpole replied, That it was matter of surprize, that an end had been put to the session of the parliament of Ireland, without making provision for the said officers.

After this, it was agreed to strike off the List of Half-Pay all the minors under 16; several' Warrant Officers, the officers of the 13 regiments reduced in Ireland, and the chaplains not provided for. Notwithstanding which, the courtiers still demanded 115,000l. for the List of Half-Pay; but the farther consideration of that matter was put off to the next day.

Jan. 25. The Commons went again into a committee of the whole House on the Supply, and the courtiers renewed the demand of 115,000l. for the List of Half-Pay. On the other hand, the opposite party were for reducing that sum to 80,000l. But Mr. Walpole having proposed 94.000/. the same was readily accepted on both sides.

Then Mr. Freeman moved, u That the vacancies in the Guards should be supplied by Half-Pay Officers But the question being put thereupon, it was carried in the negative by 164 voices against 156.

Mr. Farrer immediately reported to the House, “ That the committee had directed, him to move, and it was accordingly resolved, That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, that all vacancies which shall happen in the troops upon the British, establishment, be supplied by Half-Pay Officers, or Officers reduced, in Great Britain, of the same rank, except in the horse and foot-guards, and horse-grenadiers.” .

“ G. R.

Hereupon it was ordered, That leave be

On the following day, his Majesty came to the House of Peers, ami gave his assent to the said Bill. *

Debate in the Commons on the Mutiny .] Feb. 4.' The Commons put off the call of their House till that day sennight, and the order of the day being read, for the House to resolve itself into a Grand Committee, upon the ‘ Bill ‘ for regulating the Forces to be continued in his ‘ majesty's service, and for the payment ef the

* said Forces, and their quarters, and for pu-

* nishing Mutiny and Desertion The Serjeant at Arms was ordered to go with the mace into Westminster-hall and courts there, and court of requests, and. other places adjacent, and summon the members there to attend the service of the House; and he went accordingly:and being returned, it was ordered, “ That it be an instruction to the said Committee of the whole House, That they have power to receive a Clause, to take away unreasonable protections of soldiers from their just creditors, and also to prevent unjust or fraudulent arrests upon them.” Then the House, which was more numerous than had been known for many years past, resolved itself into a grand committee, of which Gyles Erie, esqvwas chosen chairman, a gentleman of bright parts, and equally well versed in civil and military affairs. After the reading of the Bill in question, and of the Articles of War,

Mr. Hutcheson excepted against the clause^ enacting, “ That it shall be and may be lawful to and for Courts Martial to punish Mutiny and Desertion with death; ” urging, that a Court Martial was never allowed of in England in s time of peace, as being inconsistent with the rights and liberties of a free people; and moved, That the offences committed by the soldiery be cognizable and punished by the civil magistrate.”

Sir William Thompson answered Mr. Hutcheson, and the latter was seconded by

Mr. Auditor Harley, who, to shew the danger of a standing army, governed by martial law, quoted, with great commendation, a book written some years ago by a noble member of that House, entitled, (An Account of Denmark/ Hereupon *

* “ As every thing is influenced by party in

England, the Whigs of the company had formed their plan, to chuse under the king Mr. Samuel Shepherd and sir Theodore Jansen: but the Tories laid their measures so well, that sir James Bateman, one of that party, was elected subgovernor, by a majority of 983 against 600, and" the Whigs were forced to be satisfied with chusing Mr. Shepherd for deputy-governor.” Tindal.

537] PARL. HISTORY, 4 George L 1718* — Debate on the Mutiny JB0, [5$S

The lyord Molennorth, the author of that

book, endeavoured to shew, that this was not .a parailei case; 'that the present posture of affairs in Great-Britain was vastly different from the state of things in Denmark at that juncture; and that the Commons having already declared it necessary to maintain standing forces, it was no less necessary to keep those forces within the bounds of duty and discipline, by the ordinary rules of'inartial law, as was ever practised in all civilized nations.

Sir Gilbert Heathcote having backed the lord Molesworth,

Mr. Hungerford, with his usual jocular way,

said, he remembered a remarkable passage in the History of the Revolutions in Sweden, which was, 'that one Bung, a rich burgher or alderman of Stockholm, who had much contributed to the keeping up a standing army, was the first that was hanged by martial law. General Lumley, and some others, were of Mr. Hutcheson’s opinion; and, on the other hand, sir Joseph Jekyll was for keeping up the martial law, at least a year longer. But the main brunt of the dispute fell between Mr. Craggs, Secretary at War, and Mr. Robert Walpole, who said all that the subject could bear, on either side; but who, in the heat of argument, could not forbear letting drop some sharp reflections. After they had done speaking, which was about 6 o’clock in the afternoon, some other members made speeches for and against the motion in agitation; and as Mr. Chancellor of the Dutchy had hitherto been silent, the court-party looked upon the success of this affair as very doubtful. But,

Mr. Lechmere spoke with his usual eloquence and weight; and, among other particulars, confuted what Mr. Walpole had advanced, That a Court-Martial, in time of peace, was altogether unknown in England: shewing to the contrary, that the Court of Admiralty, which is allowed in times of peace as well as of war, has an equal power in relation to seamen, with a Court Martial in relation to soldiers.

At last, about eight in the evening, the question being put, That the Clause relating to the punishment of Mutiny and Desertion .should stand as expressed in the Bill, the same was carried in the affirmative by a majority of 247 against 229; so that there were 476 members in the House, besides three Whigs and six or seven Tories, who happened to be shut out when the question was put *,

Feb. 12. The engrossed Bill, For punishing Mutiny and Desertion, ’ &c. was read the third time, and the question being put, That the said Bill do pass, it was carried in (lie affirmative by 186 voices against 105:This great ma-

into the House of Commons; a favour which, that day, was refused to several British peers.” Political State.

jority was ascribed to Mr. Walpole’s voting with the courtiers, and his having declared to his friends, That though in the debate about this bill, he was for having Mutiny and Desertion punished by the civil magistrate, yet he had rather those crimes should be punished by martial law, than not punished at all.

Debate in the Lords on the Mutiny Feb. 12. An engrossed bill from the Commons, for punishing Mutiny and Desertion, and for the better payment of the Army and their quarters, being read the first time.

Lord Stanhope said. That he wished the same might be thoroughly canvassed and examined in a full House; for he was not like some persons that changed their opinions according a? they were in or out of place.

The Duke of Argyle taking this reflection to be levelled^ against him, smartly answered, That for his own part, he followed the ministry when he thought they were in the right; hut went a contrary way, if he thought they went astray! This skirmish being over, the second reading of the Bill was put off till the Tuesday following; and the next day it was resolved to address his majesty, that the Articles of War, and otbenPapers relating to discipline and payment of the army, might be laid before the House.

Feb. 18. The said Bill was, according to order, read a second time, in a very full House; and a motion being made; That the Bill be committed to u committee of the whole House; the same occasioned a great debate. 1

The Earl of Oxford spoke first, atffl said, That as long as he had breath, he would speak for the liberties of the country; and that he was not only against this bill, because he thought a martial court inconsistent with the rights and privileges of Englishmen, but also against the keeping up so great a number of forces; which being altogether useless in a' time of profound peaoe, could not but raise just apprehensions, that something was intended against our happy and ancient constitution.

The Lord Stanhope answered, That the nation has the happiness to be governed by >a prince, who, since his accession to the throne, nas convinced every body, that he desires no more troops than what are absolutely necessary for the~safety and tranquillity of his dominions; that whoever will impartially consider the present circumstances of affairs, must own, that the number of troops that are kept on foot is very small; that it cannot be denied, that the Pretender has a great many friends both at home and abroad, who watch all opportunities to foment and take advantage of our intestine divisions: that on the other band Great Britain stands guarantee for the neutrality of Italy, which, is now threatened with an invasion:and therefore it was matter of prudence, as well as of necessity, to keep up a competent force, both to suppress any insurrection at home, or to repel any insult from abroad; and to make good our engagements for maintaining the repose of. Europe. Hereupon,

5S9] PARL. HISTORY, 4 Geo&gb I.

The Earl of Strafford said, He was surprized to hear that so great a minister as the ford who spoke last, was not better acquainted with some matters of fact; but that he thought himself obliged to inform the House, that by the Treaty concluded and signed at Utrecht in March 1713, between the ministers of Great Britain and Franoe, the late queen, of glorious memory, was guarantee for the neutrality of Italy, and the islands in the Mediterranean, only during the evacuation of Catalonia, and till the conclusion of a general peace:for the truth of which, hi? lordship appealed to his colleague in that negotiation, the lord bishop of London. He added, That since that time, the state of things was quite altered, and those in the ministry could best tell, what engagements had been entered into, either with the emperor or France. Hereupon,

The Lord North and Grey said, It were necessary to know the contents of those new ^Treaties, and therefore moved to address his majesty, that the same might be laid before the House. — Which address was agreed to, but was never presented.

The Duke of Argyle, who backed the earl of

Oxford, said, among other things, That besides the 16,000 and odd men of regular troops, there was another considerable body maintained under the denomination of Invalids, and that they ought to inquire into their numbers, and where they were quartered. To which

Lord Cadogan answered, He knew of no in-

valids but such as were'in Chelsea College, or in the neighbourhood.

After this, upon a motion of the duke of Buckingham, that the Bill be committed to a Committee of the whole House the Thursday next; it was carried without dividing.

Accordingly, on that day the order of the day was read, for the House to go into a Committee of the whole House upon the said Bill, but the opposers of the Bill being apprehensive that the court party were stronger in voices, and weaker in Proxies, (which are allowed only in a House) endeavoured to stave off the . Bill before it went into a committee. In order -> thereto the lord Trevor moved, That it be an instruction to the Committee of the whole House, to whom the said Bill was committed, That they ^o provide, that no punishment shall be inflicted at any court martial, which shall extend to life , or limb. Lord Trevor was answered by the lord Stanhope, That such a clause would render the Bill ineffectual, banish all manner of discipline from the army, and consequently render it entirely useless. Thereupon there arose a warm debate, which lasted from two till seven in the evening; in which lord Trevor, lord Bingley, earl of Anglesea, duke of Argyle, earl Poulet, lord North and Grey, duke of Buckingham, earl of Cholmondeley, lord Harcourt, lord Townshend, earl of Abingdon, and earl of Ilay spoke against the Bill; lord Stanhope, earl of Sunderland, lord Onslow, duke of Newcastle, lord Goningsby,

171 S, — Debate in the House of Lords [540

lord Cowper, lord Cadogan, and lord Carteret for it. ' '

The Earl of Anglesea endeavoured to shew. That so numerous a force as was allowed by this Bill to be maintained m time of peace, was npt only dangerous in itself to a free nation, Dut was yet rendered more dangerous, by their being governed by martial law, a law unknown to our constitution, destructive of our liberties, and not endured by our ancestors. His lordship was answered by

The Earl of Sunderland, who urged, That among the ancient Romans, the wisest people in the world, and the greatest lovers and assertors of public liberty, martial laws and discipline were invigorated by decrees of the senate, and were in force in times of peace as well as in times of war.

The Duke of Argyle replied, That it was much better to attend domestic than foreign examples; and then shewed by several instances, drawn from the history of Great Britain, that a standing army in the time of peace was ever fatal, either to the prince, or to the nation.

The Lord Onslow said thereupon, That those who are vested with the legislative power ought not, on all occasions, to govern themselves by precedents, but rather by the present situation of atfairs, because it is very didicult to find examples perfectly agreeing with the various circumstances of times: that, in his opinion, the number of troops which the Commons bad thought fit to keep standing, was absolutely necessary for the security and safety both of the government and uation; and thereupon it was no less necessary to make a law, to keep that army within the rules of duty and discipline, unless they would render useless those very forces which must be owned to be necessary.

The Earl Poulet enforced what had already been suggested, about the danger of a standing army made subject to martial law.

The Duke of Newcastle maintained on the contrary, That the forces now on foot were necessary both for the support of the government, and the protection of our allies; that their lordships ought to consider, that when the late Rebellion broke out, we had double the number of regular troops, and yet the government was obliged, not only to send for some regiments from Ireland, but also for a body of auxiliary troops from Holland; and that since the said forces were necessary, the bill in question, which was only to render them useful, was no less necessary.

The Lord North and Grey said, That before the noble peer who spoke last was born, he had seen the time, when the nation was in danger of losing their liberties by a Standing Army; and •ben his lordship endeavoured tc shew, that the power of life and death, which by this bill was given to a court martial, was unnecessary, unusual, and unjust. — It being theu about five in the evening,

The Duke of Buckingham told their lordships, That in his opinion, a great deal of time

Ml]

had been spent to little purpose:for, if their lordships would enter regularly upon the merits of this bill, they ought to be in a committee, where every lord would have an opportunity to speak as often as he thought fit. Notwithstanding this, the debate.still continued, and

The Lord Harcourt urged, That the parliament, which is the representative of the whole nation, were ever extreme jealous of the legislative power, with which they are rested; and that the Lords, in a particular manner, ought to be tender of it, because it is a branch of their prerogative to be the supreme court of judicature; but that by this bill, whereby the / king was enabled to establish courts martial, with power to try pnd determine any offences specified in the Articles of War, the parliament vested a sole legislative power in the crown, which was communicated and delegated to a council of war:That this bill sets aside all other laws, both civil and ecclesiastical, in relation to the soldiery; and gives courts martial a larger jurisdiction than seemed necessary for maintaining discipline in the army, such jurisdiction extending not only to mutiny, desertion, and breach of duty, but also to all immoralities, and other offences, which might be committed by any officer or soldier, towards any of his fellow subjects, whereby the law of the land might either be obstructed or superseded by a court martial: that the officers constituting a court martial did, at once, supply the place of judges and jurymen, and ought therefore to be upon their oath, upon their trying any offence whatsoever; whereas it is provided by' this bill, that they shall be sworn upon their trying such offences only as are punishable by death. That martial courts assume to themselves an arbitrary and unprecedented authority, of which they had a fresh remarkable instance, an en-sigu o(the guards having been sentenced to death without being heard, which was contrary to Magna Charta, and to the birth-rights and privileges of Englishmen; and therefore they ought to restrain so dangerous a power.

- The lord Harcourt was supported by lord viscount Townshend, but was opposed by the lord Coningsby.

Lord Cozoper said, That he had maturely

considered the affair now in agitation, not as a person in a public station, but as a private, unprejudiced man; and that he was convinced an judgment and conscience, that it is necessary both for the support pi the present happy establishment, and the security of the nation, to keep up the forces now on foot: and that he was confirmed in this opinion, by considering .what thoughts the Pretender and his friends bad of this matter, and reflecting, that they have nothing more at heart, than to procure the disbanding of those forces that have suppressed the late unnatural Rebellion:that he doubted not but the whole nobility that made up that august assembly, was inviolably attached to his majesty king George; that his majesty had also the best part of the landed, and all the trading interest; that as to the Clergy, he

would say nothing---- but that it was noto-

rious, that the majority of the populace had been poisoned, and that the poison was not yet quite expelled: that the dangers which seemed to be apprehended firom the present army, may be chimerical, or, at least, easily remedied in any subsequent session of parliament; whereas the dangers with which the nation is threatened from the Pretender and his friends, in case there were no army to oppose them, are real, and the mischiefs that might ensue, upon the success of their designs, irreparable:that if there had been such a standing force as we now have, timely to suppress the Tumults and Riots which were raised soon after his majesty's accession to the throne, in all probability there had been no open rebellion; that, on the other hand, if there had not been troops ready at hand to assist the civil power, in suppressing the late riotous assemblies of the Wool-Combers and Weavers, in the counties of Devon and Somerset, there had, by this time, been another rebellion:That the mentioning Magna Charta was, in his opinion; entirely foreign to the present debate: that the thing now in question, and that wherein they were immediately concerned, was to secure land support the government and the Protestant Succession against vigilant, bold, and restless enemies:and that they had the more reason tq be upon their guard, in that the trumpeters of sedition and rebellion had again forcibly intruded into several pulpits in Scotland.

• T he Earl of Abingdon answered this Speech, and the lord Cadogan having spoken on the contrary side, the earl of Hay, with great eloquence and solidity, supported the lord Trevor's motion, and endeavoured to shew, That a Standing Army in time of peace, weuld rather increase than lessen the enemies of the government. The lord Carteret replied to him with great vivacity: after which the question was put upon the said motion, and carried in the negative, viz.

Protest on rejecting a Clause for providing. That no Punishment, by a Court , shall

extend to Life or Limb ]Hereupon the fol-

lowing Protest was entered.

“ Dissentient’.

1. “ Because the exercise of martial laW, in time of peace, with such power as is given by this hill, to inflict punishments extending to Life and Limb, was not in the first year of this reign, nor hath in any former reign been allowed within this kingdom by consent of parliament, but hath, upon many attempts mado to introduce such a power, been opposed and condemned by parliament, as repugnant to Magna Charta, and inconsistent with the fundamental rights and liberties of a free people.

2. “ Because, after the Peace of Ryswick, and that of Utrecht, in the several reigns of king William and queen Anne, of glorious and ever blessed memories, no such power was

given to any court-martial; and it is well known, that the forces then continued on foot were kept in exact discipline and order.

3. *Because it is not ascertained, either by this Bill, or by any other known law or rule, what words or facts amount to Mutiny or Desertion, or to. an exciting, causing or joining in mutiny; and consequently the judges in a court-martial have it in their power to declare what words or facts they think fit to be mutiny or'desertion, and to take away the life of any officer oi* soldier, by such an arbitrary decision.

4. “ Because, should death be thought the proper punishment, in time of peace, for mutiny or desertion, or even for the least disobedience to any lawful command, yet, as we conceive, the nature of such offences ought first to have been ascertained by this bill, and the said offences being declared capital, the trial thereof ought to have been left to the ordinary course of law; in consequence whereof, the officers and soldiers would, upon such trials, have been in titled to all those valuable privileges which are the birthright of every Briton; nor doth it appear to us, that any inconvenience could thereby have arisen to the public in time of peace, at least, not any such as can justify our depriving the soldiery of those legal rights, Which belong to the meanest of their fellow subjects, and even to the vilest of malefactors.

February 21. The Lords bei^g in a grand committee, those who opposed the Mutiny-Bill began with raising objections against the preamble of it, which suggests, “ That the number of 16, 347 men is necessary :” urging, They did not know from whence that necessity should arise, the kingdom being now in full peace, without any just apprehension, either of insurrections at home, or invasions . from abroad; and thereupon it was moved, “ That the said number of 16, 347 men, be reducedvto

12,000.” Hereupon, there was a great debate, that lasted till about six in the.evening, in which the earl of Oxford, lord Trevor, lord Harcourt, earl of Abingdon, earl of Ilay, duke of Buckingham, lord Bathurst, lord North and Grey, and the lord bishop of Hereford spoke against the bill; the earl of Sunderland, lord Stanhope, lord Cowper, lord Cadogan, lord Parker, duke of Roxburgh, and lord Couingsby for it.

The Earl of Oxford endeavoured to shew, That the keeping up a standing army in time of peace was not the wav to gain the hearts, but rather to increase the disaffection of the people; and that all good and wise princes had ever chosen to depend, rather on the affections of their subjects, than on a military force. This his lordship illustrated by several instances out of our English history, and, in particular, by the fresh examples of the late king William and queen Anne; adding, That none but bad and corrupt ministers have need of troops to maintain their authority and unwarrantable proceedings.

Lord Stanhope thereupon spoke in vindication of the present administration, and, from the posture of affairs, both at home anil abroad, shewed the necessity of maintaining a greater force than in former times. It being suggested, on this occasion. That it was hoped uo minister would advise the kirfg to enter into a war, lord Stanhope readily replied. That he would be the first that should advise him to it, if he thought the honour of the crowu concerned in it. Upon this

The LordBathurst said, he was surprised to

hear such an expression from a person in his lordship’s station, whose principal care one would think, should be rather to discharge the great burthen which has been left upon the 9

445] PARL. HISTORY, 4 George X. 1 '

nation by the two last wars, than to involve it in p new one, which can hardly be maintained without making use of the funds, that have been appropriated for the payment of old debts.

Lord Cadogan having represented, That if the army was reduced to 12,000 men, it were impossible upon any emergency, to assemble a body of 4,000 men in any part of Great Britain, besides London, withdut leaving the sea ports, and other important posts, unguarded.

Lord Cozoper took occasion to suggest, That they ought not to retrench the 4,000 men who Were most necessary.

Hereupon, the question being put, Whether the words ‘ sixteen thousand' should stand part of the clause of the preamble, it was resolved in the affirmative, by 72 voices against 50. After this it being moved, and the question put, That the House be now resumed, it was resolved in the negative, by 74 voices against 48; and then their lordships proceeded to the clause, whereby mutiny and desertisn are made punishable by death; and the question being put, whether the words, death or *, should stand part of the said clause; it was resolved in the affirmative without dividing.

The next day the Lords weot again into a grand Committee on the Mutiny Bill; and it was proposed, That in the clause, which qbliges judges of a court martial to take an oath, when they try criminals for such crimes as may extend to death, to insert after death’ the words ‘ or otherwise.’ But the question being put whether these words should be added, it was carried in the negative, by 68 voices against 43. After this it was proposed to leave ' out the clause, which enables his majesty to constitute and settle Articles of War; and the question being put, whether that clause should Stand part of the bill ? It was resolved in the affirmative by 68 voices against '

Lord Stanhope having suggested, That all the objections raised against this bill amounted to no more than bare suppositions of chimerical dangers; and defied any body to charge the administration with any thing that might give just ground of apprehension for the liberties of the people:Adding, that if the government be now obliged to keep a greater number of forces than formerly, it is partly owing to the situation in which the affairs of Europe have been left by the late scandalous peace.

The Earl of Strafford thereupon said, He could not be silent while a work in which he had so great a share was so openly attacked; but that the peace which some are pleased to call Scandalous, was approved by three successive parliaments, and, in particular, by some peers now in place: that he would venture to affirm, that this* very peace had left the affairs of Europe in a better posture than they seem to be in' at present, at least with respect to Great Britain; that notwithstanding the great advantages which some boast to have obtained by the late treaties, they have yet found the way to lose our trade, to Sweden.:

to .endanger that to Spain and Italy; and to keep a standing army in full'peace; but that time will shew whether three successive parliaments will approve these measures, as well as the peace which is called infamous. At the same time, his lordship animadverted on the late proclamation, for allowing the importation of Swedish iron from ail places other than the dominions of the king of Sweden; which was, in effect, he said, no more than to appoint the Dutch to be our factors for Swedish iron.

Towards seven in the evening, the House was resumed, and the earl of Clarendon reported, That the Committee had gone through the Bill without amendment; upon which it was ordered, That the said Bill be read a third -time on the 24th, and the Lords to be summoned.

Protest against passing the Mutiny Bill.] Accordingly, on the 24th the said Bill was read a third time, and the lord North and Grey made a summary recapitulation of the objections raised against it; but the question being put, That this Bill do pass, it was resolved in the affirmative.

“ Dissentient”

“ 1. Because the number of 16, 347 men is declared necessary by this bill: but it is not therein declared, nor are we able any way to satisfy ourselves, from whence that necessity should arise, the kingdom being now (God be' praised) iu full peace without any just apprehensions, either of insurrections atr home, or invasions from abroad.

“ 2. Because so numerous a force is near double to what hath ever been allowed within this kingdom, by authority of parliament, in times of public tranquillity; and being as we conceive, no ways necessary to support, nay; we fear endanger our constitution, which has never yet been entirely subverted but by a standing army.

“ 3. Because the charge of keeping up so great a force, ought not unnecessarily to belaid on the nation, already over-burtbened with heavy debts; and'this charge we conceive to be still more unnecessarily increased, by the great number of officers now kept on the establishment in time of peace; a number far greater (in proportion to that of the soldiers commanded by them) than hath ever yet been thought requisite in times of actual war.

“ 4. Became such a number of soldiers, dispersed in quarters throughout the kingdom, may occasion great hardships, and become very grievous to the people; and thereby cause or increase their disaffection, and will, probably, ruin many of his majesty’s good subjects on whom they shall be quartered, and wiio have been already by that means greatly impoverished.

“ 5. Because such a standing army, danger-oils in itself to a free people in time of peace, is, in our opinion, rendered yet more dangerous,

2N

547]- PARL. HISTORY, 4 George L 1718 — Deon Trade to Suxden. [54$

by their being made subject to Martini Law; a.law unknown to our constitution, destructive of our liberties, not endured b our ancestors, and never mentioned in any of our statutes but in order to condemn it. '

“ 6, Because the officers and soldiers themselves, thus subjected Xo martial law, are thereby, upon their trials, divested of all those rights and privileges which render the people of this realm the envy of all other nations, and become liable to such hardships and punishments as. the lenity and mercy, of our known laws utterly disallow; and we cannot but; think those persons best prepared, and most easily tempted to strip others of their rights, who have already iqst their own.,

7.Because a much larger jurisdiction is given to courts-martial, by tins Bill, than, tons, seems necessary for maintaining discipline in the army, such jurisdiction extending not only to mutiny, desertion, breach of duty and disobedience to military commands, but also to all immoralities, and every instance of misbehaviour, which may be committed by any officer or soldier towards Any of his fellow-subjects; by which means the law of the land, in cases proper to be judged by that alone, may, by the summary method of proceedings in courts-martial, be obstructed or superseded, and many grievous offences may remain unpunished.

“ 8. Because the officers constituting a court-martial, do at once supply the place of judges and jury-rmen, and ought therefore, as we conceive, to be sworn upon their trying any offence whatsoever; and yet it is provided by this Bill, that such officers shall be-sworn upon their trying such offences only as are punishable by death; which provision we apprehend to he defective and unwarrantable by any precedent; there being no instance within our knowledge, wherein the judges of any court, haring oog-nizance of capital and lesser crimes; are under the obligation of an oath in respect#»f the one, and not of the other.

M 9. Because the Articles of War thought necessary to secure the discipline of the army, 1 in cases unprovided for by this bill, ought, m our opinion, to have been inserted therein, in like manner, as the Articles and Orders for regulating and governing the navy were enacted in the ISth year of king Charles the 2nd, to the end, that due consideration might have been had by parliament of the duty enjoined by each article to the soldiers, and of the measure of their punishment; whereas the sanction oTpar* liament is now given by this Bill to what they have had no opportunity to consider.

10. Because the clause in this Bill enabling his majesty to establish Articles of War, anil erect Courts-martial, with power to try and determine any offences to be specified in such AHjcle9, and to indict punishments for the same, within this kingdom i^ time of peace, doth (as we conceive) in all those instances, vest a sole legislative power in the crown; which power, how safely soever it may be lodged with his present majesty, and how tenderly soever it may

be exercised by him, may yet prove of dangerous consequence, should it be dvhwn into precedent in future reigns.

“ 11. Because the clause in the Bill, alMged to be made for enabling honest creditors to recover their just debts from soldiers, seems to us rather to give a protection to the soldier than any real advantage to his creditor, or ether t person having just cause of action against him; it protects the person of a soldier from execution, as well as the Mesne process, for any debt under 10/.; and it protects the estate and effects as well as the person of-every soldier from' all other suits but for debt, where the cause of action doth not amount to the like sum; and in other cases, where the cause of action exceeds, that value, plaintiffs are in many instances put under such unreasonable difficulties, that, we conceive, before they can be allowed even to commence their suit, their bare compliance therewith may become more grievous to them than the loss- of their debt, or a quiet submission to the wrong sustained; by which means his majesty’s good subjects may be highly injured in their properties, and insulted in their persons by the soldiery, and yet be deprived of the legal remedies appointed for the redress of such grievances.

ty’sresidents in Holland; tied also the Memo--rials which Mr. Jackson presented to the Re* gency of Sweden, and the Answers to them, ! were read: after which Mr. JacksOn being! called in, Mr. Craggs asked him, whether he wasj of opinion, That if the trade were opened with Sweden, our merchants would be upon a better! foot than they are at present? Mr. Jackson an-: swered, That, in his opinion, the contrary i would happen: for now that the Swedes are distressed for Want of obr commodities, par-; ticularly corn and salt, they are inclined to facilitate to us, underhand, the purchase of their iron; whereas if the prohibition of trade With them was taken off, they would immediately provide themselves with'what they want; and knowing at the same time, that there are amongst us a set of men, who make it theirstu-dy and business to embarrass the government, the court of Sweden would be more stiff than ever, and render the purchase of their iron more difficult to us, ”

Some members being offended at Mr. Jack-Son’s expression, viz.“ A set of men, " cried out, “ Custody, Custody." But the more moderate contented themselves with putting him upon explaining .himself: hereupon, Mr. Jackson replied, “ That he meant the Merchants who presented unreasonable petitions." This |>eing by some looked upon rather as an aggravation than an excuse, the ccy of “ Custody, Custody, " was repeated; but Mr. K. Walpole brought him off, by suggesting, “ That that gentleman had lived so long in a despotic government, where Petitions and Representations of that nature, are*accounted capital crimes, that he had forgot the rights and privileges of 4u$ countrymenand therefore moved, that his unguarded expressions might be •excused. Nobody opposing Mr. Walpole, Mr. Jackson withdrew. Then - the Petitioners, and some other merchants being called in, and farther heard, they represented among other particulars, “ That since the prohibition of trade With Sweden, they bought Swedish iron of the Dutch 4/. per ton dearer than before; and that whereas the English were formerly, about 30,000l. pier annum, gainers by the trade with Sweden, they now lost about 00,000l." But this was contradicted by Mr. Craggs, who suggested^ “ That the exports from Stockholm for England had never amounted to 120,000l. in one year; and therefore the difference of the profit end loss could not come up to this last sum." The merchants being withdrawn^ Mr. Heyshatn spoke in their favour, and made a motion, upon which the question was proposed, That an Address be presented to his majesty, to take into his consideration the State of the Trade with Sweden, and that such measures might be taken, that his maj esty’s subjects, and thdse of his allies, might carry on (he said trade in the same mariner. Hereupon there arose a warm debate, in which

Mr. Craggs represented, That such an address would be derogatory to the king’s honour, and even a reflection on the parliament, who

-Debate on the "Forfeited Estates Bill. [330

had desired his majesty to prohibit all commerce with Sweden; and that on the other hand, such an Address was altogether needless, since his majesty’s wisdom would not fail to apply all proper remedies to the evil that was complained of. Hereupon

Sir William Wyndhamsaid, That tire prohibition of trade with Sweden Ji.Aing been thought convenient, when there was spine grounds to fear an invasion from thence; aow that apprehension was entirely over, it would be no reflection either upon the king or his parliament, to take off the said prohibition?; and that he wondered we should distress and endeavour to ruin a prince and nation, who have ever been the support of the Protestant interest, and whom, by treaties, we stand obliged ~ to defend and, protect.

After this it was resolved by a majority of 201 votes against 111, to adjourn the debate till that day month.

The Lords read the fir9t time, the Bill i for vesting the Forfeited ‘ Estates, in Great Britain and Ireland, in ‘ trustees, to be sold for the Use of the ‘ publicand a motion being made, and the question put, That the said Bill be read a second time. The lord North and Grey spoke against the excessive power, which, by this Bill was given to the- trustees, whereby abundance of families might be oppressed and ruined; and his lordship was seconded by the lords Trevor and Harcourt, and the duke of Argyle, who urged, That this Bill by leaving the claims to ‘the Forfeited Estates to the final determination of the trustees, not only clashed with the Act of Union, in that it suspended and set aside, in that respect, the courts of judicature in North Britain, which, by the said Act, ought.to remain entire; but Was likewise derogatory to the privileges and authority of the House of Peers, who are supreme judges in all civil causes. It was also alledged. That by the method that had, been followed, the public would get little or nothing by the forfeitures; whereas, if the schethe proposed by sir David Dalrymple* had been pursued, the same would have yielded considerable sums, without any oppression to the subject. - The earl of Sunderland, the lords Stanhope, Parker, arid Coningsby, answered the objections raised against the bill; and it was, at last, resolved, That the same should be read a second time; and that a Message be 6ent to the Commons, to acquaint them, “ That their lordships, having under their consideration the Bill for vesting the Forfeited Estates of Great Britain and Ireland, in trustees, to be sold for the use of the public, they did desire that the Commons would give leave; that such of the commissioners of enquiry, who were members of that House, as also sir David Dalrymple, his majesty’s advocate-general of Scotland, might attend their lordships’ House, oa Thursday morning next." '

The next day, the Commons proceeded to take the Message before-mentioned into consideration; and appointed a Committee, to search precedents with relation to the said Message. It appearing to the Commons by the report of that Committee, that the like / desire of the Lords had, on some occasions, been complied with, and at other times denied; the Commons, who were resolved to follow the precedents for the latter, lest the Lords should make alterations in a. Money Bill, put off the considerations of the said report till the next day. Hereupon the Lords, who had waited for an answer from the Commons till three in the afternoon, proceeded to the second reading of the bill; and it being moved, that the said BHl be committed, it occasioned a great debate. The lord Har-court, the earl of Ilay, and the duke of Argyle urged several reasons against the bill; and were answered by the lords Cowper, Stanhope, and Coningsby; and after some other speeches for and against, the question being put, upon the motion before mentioned, it was carried in the affirmative by 80 votes and proxies, •gainst 73; and resolved. That the said Bill be referred to a Committee of the whole House the Saturday next following.- In the mean time the Commons having met again on the 7th of March, read only a Petition of the Tanners, in the county of Brecon, and then immediately adjourned till the 10th, to avoid taking into further consideration either the Lords’ Message, or the Report of their own Committee about Precedents.

Debate in the Lords on a Bill for rebuilding St. Giles's Church.] March 8. There was a great debate in the Lords, upon the third reading of a Bill from the Commons, intituled, ‘ An

* Act to impower the Commissioners, appointed

* to put in execution the act for building

* Fifty new Churches in London and West-. minster, to direct the parish church of St.

‘ Giles’s in the Fields, in the county of Mid-*dlesex, to be rebuilt, instead of one of the

* said Fifty new Churches.’ The archbishop of York, and some other prelates, strenuously opposed this Bill, urging, “ That the same was a misapplication of money already granted by parliament for a pipus use.”

Protest oh refusing to, ‘ of pious memory* after the Name of Queen, in the Preamble of the Bill.'] It was also proposed, That, in the preamble of the said Bill, the words ‘ of pious memory, ’ should be added after the name of the late queen; but it was carried in the negative by 54 voifces against 33.

“ Dissentient,

“ Because we cannot but judge these words, 4of pious memory, ’ highly decent and proper to have' been inserted iti a bill, reciting two pious aid gracious acts of parliament, passed in the reign of her Jate majesty, for rebuilding of fifty new churches: a wqrk earnestly recommended by her majesty to her parliament, and by them declared to be so much to the

“ Dissentient ’

1. “ Because ic doth not appear to us from any declaration in his majesty’s name to either House of Parliament, that his royal leave was given for bringing in the said bill, as, we humbly conceive, it ought to have been, for bringing in a bill of this nature.

, 2. “ Because this Bill, in our opinion, manifestly tends to defeat the ends and purposes of two acts of parliament for building Fifty new Churches, and yet at the same time asserts that the intention of the said acts would be hereby answered.

3. “ Because this Bill farther asserts. That the parish of St; Giles’s is in no condition to raise or pay the sum of 3,000£. and upwards, for the repair of its parish church; which we apprehend to be evidently false in fact; and, if itrue, to be no reason for rebuilding the said church out of the fund given for building Fifty new Churches. '

4». “ Because this bill moreover asserts, That the said Parish-church, when rebuilt, and the church which is now building in the said parish, by virtue of the acts for building fifty new qhurches, will be sufficient-for the inhabitants of the said parish; whereas we are credibly informed, and, upon the best calculation, do believe, that there are about 40,000 souls in the said parish; and do think, that three new churches, together with the, present parish-church, will be barely sufficient for that number.

5. “ Because if this precedent for rebuilding old churches, out of the fund appropriated for building new ones, should be followed, and the ends of the abovesaid acts should be thereby in any great measure defeated, we are appre-. hensive, that many thousands of his majesty’s good subjects in and about these populous cities will be left unprovided of churches, whereunto they may resort for the public worship of God; and will thereby remain destitute of the necessary means of being instructed in the true Christiati religion, as it is now professed in the church of England, and established by the laws of this realm. — W.

Protest against passing the Forfeited Estates* Biil.j March 11. The Lords, in a grand committee, read the third time the bill for vesting the Forfeited Estates in trustees, to be sold for the use of the public, and for giving relief to lawful creditors, by determining the claims, and for the more effectual bringing, into the respective exchequers, the rents and profits of the estates till sold. And a motion being made, that the bill do pass, it was carried in the affirmative, by 82 against 76.

“ Dissentient',

1. “ Because, we humbly conceive, that the charges of this commission are a very great and unnecessary burthen on the public, and will swallow up a great part of that fund the commissioners are appointed, to be guardians of; whereas the ends of that trust, which is lodged in them by this bill, might have been more - easily, more justly, and with less expence, attained by the known and ordinary course of the law.

2. “ Because there is erected in this bill a court of judicature with strange and new powers, viz. in a summary way, and without the formality of proceedings in the courts of law or equity, to proceed by, and upon the testimony of witnesses upon oath, Examination of persons claiming, or otherwise interested, upon their oaths; inspection and examination of deeds, writings and records; and by all or any of the said ways and means^or otherwise, according to the circumstances of the case, or of the persons claiming, as soon as conveniently may be, to hear, determine and adjudge all and every claim and claims: Which words seetn to contain the most arbitrary and unlimited authority that can possibly be created; and in particular, the expression concerning the circumstances of the persons is not only unknown to our laws, but prescribes a rule which was never yet thought to be a proper ingredient in the impartial administration of justice.

3. “ Because there is in this bill a penalty laid on the witnesses who shall forswear themselves to support any claim, hut no punishment inflicted on those who shall make false oaths in order to defeat any just demand.

4. “ Because there is nothing in this bill which incapacitates the commissioners, or any in trust for them, to purchase claims on the Forfeited Estates; and yet in case they should

make such purchases, they will become both judges and parties in the same cause, and con-.soquently be exposed to temptations of a great and dangerous nature.

5. “ Because the reversing and making void all.acts and decrees of any court of judicature, passed since the 24th day of June, 1715, con- cerning any right, charge or interest out of any of the Forfeited Estates, and the not saving to all creditors and other claimants such right as they had before the passing this bill, does greatly endanger, if not totally make void the

just demands of such creditors or other claimants, which they have not only in many casey a right to by the ancient laws of their country, but \Uiich are secured to them (at least in that part of Great Britain called Scotland) by the faith of an act of parliament, as a future reward of their dutiful and loyal behaviour to his. majesty and his government, when the nation was threatened with the greatest dangers; which, reward has been confirmed to them by subsequent act.

6. “ Because the time of entering claims on Estates forfeited, or to be forfeited before the 24tll of June, 1718, is allowed no farther than to the 1st of June in the said year; whereby all creditors, claimants, and bona fide purchasers of estates, which may be forfeited between the Island 24th of June aforesaid, ore absolutely and expressly barred and excluded.

7. “ Because the setting up a new court of judicature for claims on Forfeited Estates, in any pare of Great Britain, is wholly unprecedented, and the privileges and jurisdiction of this House are thereby diminished and endangered, but much more so, by the reversing decrees of courts of judicature already made, which, whether they are erroneous or legal, ought (as the constitution of this kingdom now is, and hath hitherto been) to be reviewed, reversed, or affirmed by no other jurisdiction whatsoever, but that which is inherent in the House of Lords.

8. “Because the court of session is by this bill discharged from exercising, their lawful jit* risiiction, notwithstanding that the foundation of the constitution of the united kingdom of Great Britain is the articles of the Union; wherein it is expressly stipulated. That thp court of session shall remain in all time coming as it was then constituted, with the same aur thority and privileges as before the Union; and though the said court' was subjected to regulation, for the better administration of justice, yet the jurisdiction of it wds in no case to be 1 totally extinguished.

9. “ Because the erecting new jurisdictions with such indefinite powers, ' exclusive of the House of Lords; the making void orendangerr ing the rights of great numbers of lawful creditors or other claimants, secured to them by the laws; and the depriving the courts of justice of their judicature as aforesaid, we humbly apprehend, cannot but raise the highest discontents in the minds of his majesty’s subjects.

•, H Dissentient’,

1. <(Because the comprehensive latitude of

this bill is such, that all persons without discrimination, whether well or ill affected to our constitution in church and state, papists as well as protestants, nonjurors as well as those who take this oaths, jews as well as Christians, are nil alike capable of being admitted into the Corporation to which this bill refers; and of sharing all the trusts and powers lodged in the members thereof. ....

2. Because this bill, whilst it complains of the difficulty of finding a sufficient number of proper and well qualified persons to be elected and constituted guardians and officers of the fcaid corporation, and, to avoid that pretended difficulty, lets in dissenters, doth at the same time shut out seventeen church-wardens, who, by a former act, were incorporated therein, ! and who, by the constitution, nave the care of the poor in a special manner intrusted with them.

3. “ Because this bill repeals a law, by which the dissenters were excluded from places and offices in this corporation, and this repeal may hereafter be made use of as a precedent for abrogating other laws, as yet in force, in order

. to the admission of dissenters into all places i and offices whatsoever.

4. Because this bill, by exempting guar- dians and officers thereih mentioned from the ! penalties and forfeitures of the corporation and test acts, doth, in our opinion, very much weaken the force of those acts, which are declared by the legislature to have been made for the security of the church of England, as by law established, and, as such, are, we conceive, ratified and made perpetual by that clause in the Act of Union, which enacts, That the act for the ministers of the church of England to be of sound religion, fend the act for uniformity, and all and singular other acts of parliament then in force, for the establishment and preservation of the church of England, shall remain and be in full force for ever.

The King's Message for an Additional Number of Seamen.'] March 17. Mr. Comptroller Boscawen acquainted the House, That he bad a Message to the House signed by his majesty:which was read as follows:

« G. R.

11 His majesty being at present engaged in several negotiations of the utmost concern to the welfare of these kingdoms, and the tranquillity of Europe; and having lately received information front abroad, which makes him judge that it willgive Weight to his endeavours, if a naval force be employed Where it shall be necessary,

does think fit to acquaint this House therewith; not doubting but that in case he Should he obliged, at this critical juncture, to exceed the nuraberof men granted this year for the Sea-Service, the House will at their next meeting, provide for such exceeding."

Upon ^this, sir William Strickland moved, “ That an Address be presented to his majesty, to return his majesty the thanks of this House, for his unwearied endeavours to promote tiie welfare of his kingdoms, and to preserve the tranquillity of Europe: and to assure his majesty, that this House will make good such eX-ceedingsof men for the Sea-Service of the year 1718, as his majesty in his royal wisdom shall find necessary to obtain those desirable ends." This motion, being seconded and the question put thereupon, was carried without dividing. — It is. remarkable, that the Spanish embassador having about this time expostulated concerning the great preparations for sending a Fleet into the Mediterranean, Mr. Walpole said, That such an Address had all the air of a declaration of war against Spain.

March 18. Mr. Boscawen acquainted the House, “ That their Address had been presented to his majesty; hnd that he was commanded by his majesty to return his majesty’s hearty thanks to this House, and to assure them, that his majesty Shall »think himself obliged, in return of the great confidence they have reposed in him, not only to use the utmost oeconomy that shall be consistent with the real interest of his subjects for this ensuing year; but likewise to apply his most earnest endeavours to prevent future burthens to his people, by establishing a lasting peace and tranquillity."

The King's Speech at the Close of the Session.] March 21. This day, the King .came to the House of Peers, and the Commons being sent for and attending, his majesty gave the royal assent to several Bills. After which, his Majesty was pleased to say;

“ My Lords, and Gentlemen;

“ I have commanded my Lord Chancellor to deliver, in ray name and words, what I think fit should he said to you, on my putting an end to this session of parliament."

•And then the Lord Chancellor read his majesty's Speech as follows:

uMy Lords, and Gentlemen»;

“ I cannot put an eod to this session, without returning my hearty thanks to so good a parliament, for the dispatch which has been given to the public business. You will, I hope, in your private capacities, feel the convenience of an early rfecess; and, I am persuaded, the public Will receive great benefit by the seasonable zeal and vigour of your resolutions in support of any government.

“ Nothing can add so much to the credit and influence of this crown, both at home and abroad, as the repeated instances of your affection tow* This steadiness and resolution ofyougs

will, I hope, enable me to procure* against your next meeting, such Treaties to be concluded, as will settle peace and tranquillity among our neighbours.

u If through the blessing of God my endeavours to this end prove successful ', I shall have the satisfaction to silence even those who will never own themselves convinced; and to letr all the world see plainly, that what 1 have most at heart, is the good and welfare of my people, who may then be eased in their taxes, and enriched by their Trade.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons, uI must return you my particular thanks for the Supplies you have so cheerfully granted, and for the late instance of your confidence in me. I promise you, that my endeavours shall npt be wanting to make use of both to the best advantage for the good of my people. u My Lords and Gentlemen;

The practices which are daily used by a most restless and unhappy set of men, to disturb a-government by whose clemency they are protected, require our utmost attention and vigilance. I must therefore recommend it to you, that in your several stations and countries, you will endeavour to quell that spirit of disaffection, which our common enemies are so industrious to foment."

. Then the Lord Chancellor prorogued the Parliament to the 20th of May ; * after which it was farther prorogued, tp the lltb of November.

FOURTH SESSION of the FIFTH PARLIAMENT of GREAT BRITAIN.

The King's Speech on Opening the Session.] November 11. This day the King came to the House of Peers, and the Commons attending, his majesty delivered the following Speech into the hands of the Lord Chancellor,

* “ About this time there were some changes . in the Ministry. Sir Edward Northey^vas removed, and Mr. Lechmere was made Attorney General in his room. The earl of Sunderland was made President of the Council and first Commissioner of the Treasury. The other commissioners were Aislabie, Wallop, Baillie, and Clayton. Mr. Craggs and' the lord Stanhope (who and lord Cadogan were soon after created earls) were appointed secretaries of state* The earl of Berkley was placed at the head of the Admiralty, with sir George Byng, sir John Jennings, Mr. Cockburne, Mr. Chetwynd, sir John Norris, and sir Charles Wager. The earl of ' Bolderness was made first commissioner of the Board of Trade. In April, the Lord Chancellor Cowper (who had been made an earl) resigned the great seal, and went immediately into the country. Though it had been reported some months that he desired to retire, yet his resigning his employment at that juncture, was a great surprize to the public, and no small grief to all unprej udiced persons, The judges Tracy,

(Parker *) who read the same to both Houses:

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

“ Since your last recess, I have, by the blessing of Almighty God, concluded such terms add conditions of peace and alliance between the greatest princes of Europe, as, will, in all human .appearance, induce others, to follow their example, and make any attempts to disturb the public tranquillity not only dangerous but impracticable.

“ These engagements, I am persuaded, will be so much the more agreeable to all my good subjects, as they bind the contracting powers to support the Succession to these kingdoms in. my family, to which'some were not at all, and others not so fully bound by any former treaties.

“ During the whole course of these uegotia-

Prat, and Mountague, were made commissioners of the greatseal; but, about a month after, the lord Parker was made High-Chancellor.* Tindal.

♦ “ Thomas Parker was born in 1667, and if not a native was long a resident at Derby, where he followed the profession of an attorney. Abilities and interest procured him practice, that practice brought money, and money consequence. These united introduced him into the office of Recorder, which opened a wider field for his talents. He soon became a pleader at the bar, travelled the midland circuit, acquired additional estimation, was denominated the silver-tongued counsel/ and found interest enough in 1705, to cause himself to be returned a member for the borough of Derby with lord James Cavendish. Having now ascended into a political atmosphere, where his talents beamed with more diffusive brightness, he made rapid advances towards preferment. He was knighted in 1705, and appointed queen’s serjeant. The Commons, sensible of his powers, chose him one of their ma--nagers in the trial of Dr. Sacheverell, which he conducted with great ability. In 1710, he was made Lord Chief Justice of the King’s Bench; and refused the Chancellor's seals because his sentiments did not coincide with those of the Harleian ministry* He was created baron Parker in 1716, viscount Parker of Ewelme, in 1718, and then accepted the Seals. In 1721, he was further created earl of Macclesfield, and continued Lord Chancellor till 1725, when he was accused of selling places in Chancery, brought to trial* end fined 30*000/. The king called for the council book, and with a sigh dashed' out his name. Unhappily for his lordship, party rage ran high, and a brand was fixed upon his name which never wore out. It must be presumed, however, that the charges were fully proved, as out of 93 peers who gave judgment, there was not one who pronounced ‘ Not Guilty.' He retired during the last eight years of his life to Derby, where he resigned ni9 earthly existence, April 28, 1732." Orford’s Royal' and Noble Author*. Park's edit, voh 4, p. 145,

tions, a most strict regard has been had to the interests of Spain; and better conditions have been stipulated for that king, than were insisted upon in his behalf even at the Treaty of Utrecht; bat the war in Hungary, which by our mediation is since happily ended, having tempted the court of Spain unjustly to attack the emperor, and the hopes they have since conceived of raising disturbances in Great Britain, France, and elsewhere, having encouraged them to believe, that we should not be able to act in pursuance of our Treaties, for the defence of the dominions invaded by them, nor even to support those other essential and necessary conditions of the Treaty of Utrecht, which provide against the, great monarchies of Europe being at any time hereafter united under one sovereign, they have not only persisted in such a notorious violation of the public peace and tranquillity, but have rejected all our amicable proposals, and have broke through their most solemn 'engagements for the security of our commerce.

; “ To vindicate therefore the faith of our former Treaties, as well as , to maintain those which we lately made, and to protect and defend the trade of my subjects, which has in every branch been violently and unjustly oppressed, it became necessary for our naval forces to check their progress. It was. reason-1 able to hope, that the success of our arms, the repeated offers of friendship, which I have never ceased to make in the most pressing manner, and the measures taken in concert with the Emperor and the most Christian king, to restore the public tranquillity, would' have . roduced a better disposition in the court of pain; but I have received informations, that instead of listening to our reasonable terms of accommodation, that court has lacelv given orders at all the ports of Spain and of the West Indies, to fit out privateers, and to take .our ships.

“Iam persuaded that a British parliament will enable me. to resent such treatment, as becomes us: and it is with pleasure that I can assure you of the ready and friendly resolutions of our good brother the Regent of France, to concur and join with me in the most vigorous measures.

“ The firm confidence I repose m the affection of my people, together with my earnest desire to ease them of every charge not absolutely necessary, determined me, immediately after the exchange of the ratifications of our great alliance, to make a very considerable reduction of our land-forces; nor could I better express, than by so doing, how little we apprehend the attempts of our enemies to disturb the peace of my kingdoms, even though Spajn should think fit to continue some time in war. , Our naval force imployed in concert with our allies, will, I trust in God, soon put a hftppy end to the troubles which the ambitious views of that court have begun, and secure to toy subjects the execution of the many treaties in force relating to pur commerce.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons j

“ I must desire you to grant roe such Sup- ' plies, as will enable me to carry on the service of the year. I have given orders to have the proper Estimates laid before you, whereby yon will perceive I have reduced theexpenceasmuch our circumstances can well admit. I have the pleasure toobserve to you that the funds appropriated for sinking the public debts, have answered above expectation. I must however recommend to you to consider of proper methods for improving them, by preventing the Frauds and Abuses daily committed in the public Revenues, not doubting in all your proceedings you will have that regard to tiie inviolable preservation of the public credit, which may quiet the minds of all those that have 'trusted to parliamentary engagements..

“ Rly Lords and Gentlemen;

“ There never was a time when your unanimity, your vigour, and dispatch, were.more necessary to so many good ends, as those we have now in view. I have done my part. It remains with you to give the last finishing to this great work. Gur friends and our enemies, both at home acd abroad, are waiting the event of your resolutions:and I dare promise myself that the first have nothing to apprehend,

' nor the others to hope, from your conduct in this important juncture, tvho nave, during the whole course of my reign, given such lively proofs of your zeal and affection to my person, and of your love to your country.” ,

Debate in the Lords tm the Address of Thanks.'] The King being withdrawn, and the Commons returned to 'their House, the lord Carteret moved for an Address of Thanks to his majesty, for-his care in preserving the public peace, and the balance of power in Europe; for the considerable reduction jof the land-forces; and for having obtained $9 great and farther securities of the] Successiou to these kingdoms in his royal family; as also to congratulate the seasonable success of his majesty's naval forces; and to assure him, that the House would support him in the pursuit of those prudent and necessary measures he had taken to secure the trade and quiet of these kingdomis, and the tranquillity of Europe. He was seconded by the lord Tenham, but several lords excepted against the congratulating his majesty upon the seasonable success of his Naval Forces, and the promising to support him in the pursuit of those prudent and necessary measures he had taken, because it was, in effect, to approve a sea-fight which might be attended with dangerous consequences, and give the sanction of that august assembly to mesn surcs, which, upon examination, might, appear either to clash with the laws of nations, and former treaties, br to fce prejudicial to the trade of Great Britain; that according to the constant usage of that House, they ought to pro-, ceed with the utmost caution and maturest, deliberation in an affair, wherein the honour, and interest of the nation were so highly concerted.-

5G1] PAUL. HISTORY, 5 George I. 171$. — Debate on the Address of Thanh.

Lord Strafford insisted. That before they

approved die sea-fightf they ought to be satisfied whether the same happened before or after the signing of the Quadruple Alliance, and therefore moved for an Address that sir George Byng’s instructions might, be laid before the House. To this it was answered by

Lord Stanhope, That there was no manner of

occasion for such an Address, since, by his majesty’s command, he bad already laid befose the House the Treaties of which the late Sea-Fight was a consequence, and in particular the treaty for a defensive Alliance between the - emperor and his majesty, made at Westminster the 25th of May, 1716; and the treaty of alliance for restoring and settling the public peace, signed at London the 22d of July, O. S. After this his lordship accounted at large for the justice and equity of those Treaties, which were mainly calculated to preserve, restore and settle the peace of Europe, by rendering the treaty of Utrecht effectual, particularly in preventing the union of the two great monarchies of France and Spain, under one sovereign, and in securing the succession of these kingdoms in his majesty’s royal family. At the same tinie, his lordship she wed how the court of Spain had violated the treaty of Utrecht, and acted against the public faith in attacking t; he emperor’s dominions, while he was tngaged in a war against the enemies of Christendom, and in what manner they had rejected his majesty’s friendly offices, and repeated offers of mediating an accommodation between the emperor and his catholic majesty. To which purpose his lordship gave the House an account of his late journey to, and negociations in, Spain. He added, That it was high time for Great Britain to. check the growth of fhe naval power of Spain, in order to protect and secure the trade of the British subjects, which had been vlo-x’lently oppressed by the Spaniards; to which purpose several letters were rea, d: concluding, that both with relation to sir George Byng’s instructions, and in all other respects, in this whole affair, his majesty had acted by the advice of his privy council; that he was one of that number; and bethought it an honour to have advised his majesty to these measures, because he was persuaded they intirely agreed with the honour and interest of his country; that he doubted not, but, upon the strictest examination, these measures would be approved of by all true Englishmen; and that he was ready to answer for them with his head.

This speech delivered with becoming vehemence, made a great impression on the whole assembly, and though several peers still urged, that the making war before the declaring of it, was a manifest violation of the law of nations; and others raised less material objections; yet the question being put upon the lord Carteret’s motion, the same was carried in the affirmative by 83 voices against 50. The Speakers for the Address were the lords Carteret and Tenham, and the earls of Sunderland and Stanhope; and on the other side, the dukes of Bucking-you VII. *

ham, Devonshire, and Argyle, the earls of Nottingham, Cowper, Oxford, and* Ilay, the lords. North and and Grey/and Harcourt.

The Lords’ Address of .] Nov. 13,

The Lords presented their Address to his Ma*» jesty, as follows:

Most Gracious Sovereign,

* We, your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, do return yonr majesty our humble thanks lor your most gracious speech from the throne:and desire to express to your majesty the true sensethrs House has of your care in preserving the public peace, and the just balance of power, in Europe; and of the tender regard which your majesty has shewn for the trade of your subjects. The considerable reduction of the Land Forces which your majesty has made at'this time, must fully satisfvall your subjects, that you will never desire the continuance of more troop9 than what are absolutely neces- " sary for their safety. In a most particular manner we thank your majesty, for having obtained such great and further securities of the Succession to these kingdoms in your royal family, as will, under the blessing of God, perpetuate the Protestant Succession undisturbed. We most heartily congratulate your majesty upon the seasonable success of your naval Forces; and beg leave to assure your majesty that this House will, to the utmost of their power, stand by, and support your majesty, in the vigorous pursuit of those prudent and necessary measures your majesty has taken, to secure the trade and quiet of these kingdoms, ' and the tranquillity of Europe.”

The King’s Answer.] His Majesty returned this answer:

“My Lords;

“ I thank you for this Address, so full of duty to me, and affection to yourcobmry. I cannot doubt but my endeavours, for the happiness of my people and the tranquillity of Europe, will attain the ends proposed, when' the enemies to both shall see me supported therein by this House with so much warmth and zeal.”-

Debate iif the Commons on the Address of. Thanks.] The Commons being returned to their House, Mr. Craggs, by his majesty’s com- -mand, presented to the House copies, in Latin, of several Treaties, with a List of them; and the title of the copies of the said Treaties were read, and then the lord Hinchingbroke moved,

“ That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, returning the thanks of the House for his most gracious' Speech from the throne, and for the many and great instances which he has therein given to his people, of his constant endeavours for their security and welfare ; . That the House has intire satisfaction in those measures which his majesty has already taken for strengthening the Protestant Succession, and establishing a lasting tranquillity in Europe; and particularly in relation to the crown of Spain; and i» resolved to enable his mtyesty,

in concurrence cwith his allies, not only to re* sent the injuries that crown has already done to the commerce of these kingdoms, hi breach of the treaties subsisting between the two nations, but will likewise support him, in the most vigorous and effectual manner, in such farther measures as his majesty shall judge necessary to complete the public tranquillity, and to check the growth of that naval power, which must otherwise prove dangerous to the trade of these kingdoms, and to the repose of Europe*”

The lord Hinchingbroke was backed by the lord Tyrconnel, sir David Dalrymple, Mr. JLechmere, Mr. Craggs, Mr. John Smith, sir Gilbert Heathcote, sir Wilfred Lawson, Mr. Hampden, Mr. Aislabie, Mr. Boscawen, and colonel Bladen; but the motion being opposed by Mr. Freeman, Mr. lleysham, Mr. Walpole, Mr. Snell, Mr. Hungerford, Mr. Herne, sir Joseph Jekyll, Mr.Cowper, sir William Wyndham, Mr. Shippen, lord Molesworth, and general Ross, a warm debate ensued.

The Country Party strenuously objected sigainst the words, ‘ entire satisfaction in those

* measures which his majesty had already

* taken.’ In order therefore to have these words left out of the Address, it was alledged an the first place, That it was unparliamentary ^aud unprecedented, on the first day of 'a session to enter upon particulars: That the business in question being of the highest import* %nce, viz. peace or war, deserved the matures! deliberation: That before they approved of the measures that had been taken, they ought to examine the Treaties, and the reasons on which those measures were founded, which must needs take up some time; and therefore they ouglit, for the present, according to the usual custom, to content themselves with returning hi* majesty their thanks for his Speech, with general assurances of their zeal and affection for his majesty’s person and government, and then appoint a day to take the said Speech into consideration.

To this the Courtiers answered, that though all applications from the House to the throne differed according to the various circumstances of affairs, yet there were not wanting precedents to support the expressions excepted against, of which some instances were produced; That the measures that had been taken, were grounded on Treaties that had been laid before them, and which might be examined into as soon as the House thought fit; but that it was necessanr, at this critical juncture, when the eyes of all Europe were fixed bn this parliament, early to come to a vigorous Resolution, which would not fail having its due weight abroad. This was warmly opposed by

Mr. R. Walpole, who urged, That it was against the common rules of prudence, and the methods of proceeding in that House, to approve a thing before they knew what it was. That he was thoroughly convinced of, and as ready as any person in that assembly, to acknowledge his majesty’* great care for the ge-fKrai peace of Europe, and the interest of.

Great Britain; but that the giving sanction, in the manner proposed, to the late measures, could have no ether view, than to screen ministers, who were conscious of having done something amiss, and, who having begun a war against Spain, would now make it the parliament’s war: concluding, that instead of an entire satisfaction, they ought to shew their entire dissatisfaction with a conduct that was contrary to the laws of nations, and a breach of solemn treaties. Upon this Mr. Craggt gave the House an account of the measures which the king and his minister* had pursued for restoring and securing the tranquillity of Europe, and said, That upon that view a Treaty of defensive alliance between hi* majesty and the emperor had been signed in May 1716, and by that very gentleman, then m a high station, who how excepted against these measures: That, at the same time, his majesty sincerely desired and endeavoured to maintain a perfect friendship with the king of Spain, and had even proposed a defensive alliance to him, before he made one with any other power; That notwithstanding the engagements his majesty was under, to guaranty the neutrality of Italy, and to defend thte emperor in the pdsses-sion of his dominions, which, upon the invasion of Sardinia, might have justified his majesty’* assisting his imperial majesty against Spain; yet the king chose rather to act as a friendly mediator, and, in concert with the regent of France; endeavoured to find out means of reconciling the interests of the emperor and of the king of Spain, as the only way to put a stop to the war that threatened Italy, and in which all Europe might be involved; that the Catholic king was often solicited by the British minister* at Madrid, to Concur with his majesty’s good intentions, and to give such instructions to thar Spanish minister here, as would put it in hi* majesty’s powter to stand up f6r the interest and advantages of Spain in the ensuing negotiations a that the Catholic king having declined to concert measures with Great Britain, and - demanding, in general, satisfaction for the breoche* he pretended the emperor had made upon the Treaty of Utrecht, the balance of power in Europe, and the security and liberty of the princes and states of Italy, all that his majesty, with the regent’s assistance, could do, was to obtain of the emperor such conditions as were thought most agreeable to his catholic majesty; to wit, an absolute renunciation of the monarchy of Spain and the I ndies, and a very considerable settlement1-in Italy for prince of Spain, particularly the great duchy of Tuscany fc that as the emperor’s pretensions to Sicily were? the principal reasons of his opposing the Treaty of Utrecht, from which he could not afterward* be brought off by the Treaty of Baden, it became necessary, towards an accommodation, to dispose of that island in favour of his imperial, majesty, of whom, upon that consideration, hi* majesty and the regent of France obtained the disposition of Sardinia in favour of the king of Sicily; that these were the principal Article* of

the Treaty of Alliance, for restoring and settling the public peace, commonly called the Quadruple Alliance, which was, a long while depending, and at last signed here, on the 22d of July, 1718: that in order to support the views of this Treaty, and to add weight to the endeavours for restoring the tranquillity of Europe, his majesty acquainted the Commons, towards the end of the last session of parliament, that he intended to employ a naval force when it should be ne-eessay; whereupon this House unanimously resolved to return his majesty their Thanks for his unwearied endeavours to promote the welfare of his kingdoms, and to preserve the tranquility of Europe; apd to assure his majesty, that they would make good such exceedings of men for the sea service for the year 1718, as his majesty, in his royal wisdom, should find necessary to obtain those desirable ends: That this unanimous Resolution undoubtedly implied an entire satisfaction in the measures his majesty was at that time concerting for preserving the tranquillity , of Europe; and if an action has since happened in consequence of those measures, this cannot, with any justice, be called the War of the Ministers, but rather the War of the Parliament: that, however, it was not with design of making war, but only of restoring peace,

< that his majesty sent a strong squadron into the Mediterranean: that, pursuant to this view, as soon as sir George Byog reached the coast of Spain, he wrote a letter to that king, desiring him tp accept his majesty’s mediation, and to desist from the hostilities already begun; offering him his service, either to withdraw his troops, or even to assist him, in case the emperor should not consent to a suspension of arms; which the admiral proposed while an accommodation should be negociated: that the Spaniard, having with haughtiness rejected his mqje^ty’s repeated amicable proposals, and ifbt only persisted in the violation of the public peace, by the invasion of Sicily, but likewise broke through most solemn treaties for the security of our Trade, it became necessary for his majesty’s naval forces tp check these insolent and violent proceedings, as well to maintain the faith of his majesty’s engagements, and prevent the consequences of this war, as to protect and defend the trade of the British subjects, which labours under the heaviest hardships and difficulties. — -To co a firm this last assertion,

Cob Bladen produced a list of many merchant ships, taken or detained by the Spaniards.

, Mr. R. Walpole having made solemn professions of his duty and affection to the king, and of his readiness to acknowledge his majesty’s royal care and constant endeavours for the security end welfare of his people, and the tranquillity of Europe; hut distinguishing between his majesty and his ministers, and shewing an unwillingness to approve the measures pursued by the latter, cotill the treaties on which those measures were founded, had been fully and maturely examined:

Mr. Crpggs readily admitted of the distinction between thejupgandiusn ^

That he observed with a peat deal of pleasure, how unanimous they were all for the king, and, that he should be extremely sorry if the minis* ters should be the occasion of any dglay in the House’s expressing their duty and affection to his majesty; that he owned ministers w$renot infallible; that be bad the honour to be one of his majesty’s servants, and had gone as greag lengths as any in the measures that bad been taken:but that he was so positive, that in the course of this whole affair nothing bad bee% done that was not entirely consistent with tho faith of treaties, and the honour and interest oh - the nation, that he durst promise, both for him self and. the rest of the ministers, that if the House came into this vote, which he thought of the highest importance at this critical juncture, no manner of advantage would be taken of it to palliate any faults, which, through human frailty, might have been committed; add that for hid own part he was ready to undergo the severest examination, whenever the House should think fit to enquire into the conduct of the ministry.

Upon the whole matter, the question being, at last put, upon the lord Hinchingbroke’s motion, it was carried in the affirmative by Sid votes against 155.

’ A Supply granted.'] Nov. 19. The Commons pursuant to their Address immediately voted.a Supply. They allowed for the sea service 13, 500 sailors at 4/. a month each, amounting to 702 000/. Twelve thousand four hundred thirty-five men were voted for the land service, whose pay amounted to 526, 964/. 11s. 8 d.These sums, with what was voted for making good deficiencies, for the ordinary of the navy, and other things, amounted in all to 2, 257, 581/. 19s.

The bills for the land and malt-tax were presented, and both passtd in one day, a dispatch not to be paralleled in any parliament since the Revolution.

Debate in the Lords oh the Bill for strengthening the Protestant Interest.] December 13. After the Lords bad passed a bill ‘ For quieting and establishing Corporations/

The Lord Stanhope stood up and said. That, in his opinion, a thing of greater importance, and becoming the wisdom of that august assembly, yet remained to be done, in order to settle the minds, and unite the hearts and affections of the well affected to the present happy establishment; and that for that purpose, he had a hill to offer to the House, intitled, 4 An Act.for strengthening the Protestant interest in these kingdoms*/ which he de-

* 44 The king, judging by the disposition of the parliament, that it would be a proper time to execute a design, he had long beeu meditating, resolving to attempt it this session. Ever since his accession to the throne he had

sired might be read. It being the privilege of every peer to bring in such a Bill as he thinks proper, without the previous leave of the House, the said bill was read, importing a repeal of part of the Act of the 10th year of her late majesty’s reign, intituled, 4'An Act for preserving the Protestant Religion, by better securing the Church of England, and against Occasional Conformityas also of the act of the 12th of her late majesty’s reign, To prevent the Growth of Schism; and of some clauses in the Test and Corporation acts/ The lord Stanhope having moved, That it might be read a second tithe, the same occasioned a long debate: wherein the lord Stanhope endeavoured to shew the equity, reasonableness, and advantage of restoring Dissenters to their natural rights, and of easing them of the stigmatizing and oppressive laws, made against them in turbulent times, and obtained by indirect methods, for no other reason than because they ever shewed their zealous and firm adherence to the Revolution and Protestant Succession; urging, That this desirable union of all true Protestants, as it would certainly strengthen the Protestant interest, so would it rather be an advantage, than any prejudice to the church of England, by law established, which would still be the head of all the Protestant churches; and the archbishop of Canterbury become the patriarch of all the protestant clergy.

Lord Stanhope was seconded by the earls of Stampford and Sunderland, and some other lords: but the dukes of Buckingham and De-

assured the church of England of his protection, but at the same time declared for a just Toleration, by removing the odious distinction* between churchmen and non-conformists. In the former session he had plainly enough discovered his intention, but the prosecution of it was prevented, by the misunderstanding among the Whigs. The Dissenters, besides the Occasional and Schism Bills, lay under the weight of the Sacramental Test. As they had been zealous asserters of the Protestant succession, they expected to be relieved from these burdens as soon as that Succession took place. To that end consultations had been held the last year, but without any effect. The affair was now resumed, and debated by the Dissenters in many meetings, in several parts of the kingdom. The majority in these meetings were for a general reptaPof the acts that they thought hardships upon them, or leaving matters as they stood. But they were assured that the king had pressed the affair to the utmost with the ministers, and that the lord Sunderland said,

4 It was impracticable, and to attempt a repeal of the Test would ruin all/ Upon this the Test was given up, after assurances that the Test-act should also he repealed in a more proper time. Earl Stanhope therefore was to move for a repeal of the Occasional and Schism Acts passed in the latter end of the reign of queen Anne.” Tiadal.

vonshire, the carls of Nottingham, Aylesford, Oxford, Cowper, and Hay, the lord viscount Townshend, and the lord North and Grey, endeavoured to put off the second reading of the Bill to a long day. They alledged, That this Bill, instead of strengthening, would certainly weaken the church of England; by plucking off her best feathers, investing her enemies with power, and sharing with them civij and military employments, of which church-inen only are now in possession.

. The Duke of Devonshire, in particular, sug-

gested, That it was irregular to bring in a bill of so great consequence without previously acquainting the House; Blit it was readily answered by

Lord Stanhope, that his grace had forgot that about two years before he brought in himself, in the same manner, a bill of much greater consequence. *

The Earl of Nottingham said upon this occasion, That the church of England is certainly the happiest church in the world, since even the greatest contradictions contribute to her support: For nothing could be more contradictory than a bill which is said to be calculated to strengthen the Protestant Interest, and the church of England, and which at the same time repeals two acts that were made for her further security.

The Earl Cowper made also a long speech against some parts of the bill; and, among other things, said, That he had no manner of prejudice against the Dissenters, but rather a tender regard for them; that, as he had been bred in, so he had ever communicated with the Church of England, which he believed to be the best Protestant church, and the most agreeable to the primitive pattern of Christianity; but that, however, if he bad happened to be at Geneva, be would not have scrupled to have communicated with the Protestants there. That he was for giving the Dissenters as much ease, as was consistent with the safety of the constitution in church and state, and would readily give his vote for the repealing of the Schism act; but that he could not but oppose that part of the bill now laid before them, whereby part of the Test and Corporation Acts were effectually repealed, with relation to Dissenters;

• because he looked upon those acts as the main bulwark of our excellent constitution incbucch and ‘State; and therefore would have them inviolably preserved and untouched.

The Earl of Ilay, upon this occasion, said, in substance, That every body knew, he was educated in a different way fr<*n the church of England: hut nevertheless, he could not but be against this bill, because, in his opinion, it broke the Pacta Conventa of the treaty of Union, by which the bounds, both of the church of England, and of the church of Scotland, were fixed and settled; and that he was apprehensive, that if the Articles of the Union

' See the debate on the Septennial Bill, brought in by the duke ef Devonshire, p. 295.

were broke with respect to one church, itmight afterwards he a precedent to break them with respect to the other.

The Lord North and Grey spoke also against the hill, and urged, That this was an affair of so great importance, that it'ought to be maturely considered, and debated in a full House; and a great many members being absent, his lordship moved “That the second reading might be put off for a month; and that the Lord Chancellor be ordered to write circular letters to summon all the lords to attend, upon the severest penalty the kouse could inflict.”

The Duke of Buckingham was of his lordship’s opinion, as to the putting off the second reading to a long d^y; but thought it needless to give the Lord Chancellor, who had business enough upon his bands, the trouble of writing circular letters: and therefore his grace suggested, That every lord, then present, might write to his absent friends, to acquaint ifyem with what was depending in the House; and. he was sure such letters would be more acceptable and effectual than a formal summons.

The court party being unwilling to let this affair cool, by adjourning it so long, the earl of Ilay proposed, “That the second reading might only be put off till Thursday the 18th of December, w which was agreed to without dividing.

Accordingly, upon that day, the bill whs read a second time, and a motion made for committing it to a committee of the whole House; but this being opposed by the earl of Nottingham, and some other peers,

The Earl of Cholmondclysuggested, that be-

fore they proceeded any farther, in an affair wherein the Church was so nearly concerned, he thought it very proper to have, in the first place, the opinion of that venerable bench, pointing to my lords the bishops. This being unanimously assented to,

The Archbishop of Canterbury stood up, and declared against the bill, for which his erace gave his reasons, importing in substance, That the acts which by this bi|l were to be repealed, are the main bulwark and supporters of the established church; that he.had all imaginable tenderness for nil the well-meaning conscientious J)issenters; but he could not forbear saying, that some amongst them made a wrong use of the favour and indulgence that was shewn them upon the Revolution, though they had the least share in that happy event; and therefore it was thought necessary for the legislature to interpose, and put a stop to the scandalous practice of Occasional Cory fotmiiy, which was condemned by the soberest part of the Dissenters them>elves. And as to the Act against Schism; though it may carry face of severity, yet it seemed needless to make a law to repeal it, since no advantage had been taken of it, against the dissenters, ever since it was made.

The Archbishop of Yospoke on the same tide, end said. That the arguments used the other day for this bill, had no more weight with hint, than they bad with his brother of Canterbury. His grace urged, in particular, the danger of trusting the Dissenters, the open and avowed enemies of the church, with power and authority; and endeavoured to account for the acts against Occasional Conformity and Schism, by1 saying, they were only for self-defence and self-preservation, and not for persecution; adding, that Dissenters were never to be gained by indulgence. To that purpose, he quoted a passage out of a treatise, intitled, “ A Persuasive to Lay Conformity, ” written by a prelate, who, it was insinuated, bad, since the writing of that book, embraced and maintained other principles. His grace also took this opportunity to clear the clergy of the Established Church, from the aspersion of disaffection to the present happy settlement, by instancing two divines, who, during the late unnatural rebellion, had given signal proofs of their loyalty and seal for his majesty a person and govern-, tnent.

* Sir William Dawes. “ He was born at Lyons near Braintree, Essex, 13th September 1671. From Merchant-Taylor’s school be went to St. John’s College, Oxford; but about two years after, in consequence of the death of his two elder brothers, and his inheriting the estates of his father, sir John Dawes, bart. he removed to Cambridge, as nobleman of Catharine Hall. Soon after taking his degree of

M. A. he married Frances daughter of sir Thomas Darcy, and at the proper age entered into orders, and in 1696, after being made D. D. by royal mandate, he was elected master of his College. King William, who was pleased with one of his sermons, gave him a prebend of Worcester, and he was afterwards made rector and dean of Booking, Essex, in every situation re-comraending.himself to the good opinion of his neighbours, by his affable, benevolent, and charitable conduct.. On the accession of.Queen Anne, he was made one of the royal chaplains; but a sermon which he preached offeodea some of his ministers, and the see of Lincoln intended for him, was conferred on Wake, 1705. Two years after, however, the Queen named him for the see of Chester, and in 1714 be was translated to York. He died, 30th April 1734.”

answered the archbishop of York, partieolarljr with relation to the passage quoted out of one of his Treatises. He said, He was so far from having altered his principles, that both before and after he had been promoted to the station he held in the church, he had endeavoured to bring over the Dissenters; but that be ever was ojf opinion, that gentle means me the most effecr tual for that purpose. After this he endeavoured to shew at large the unreasonableness and ill policy of imposing religious tests, as a qualification for civil or military employments, which abridges men of their natural rights, dor prives the state of the service of many of it# best subjects, and exposes the most sacred institutions and ordinances to be abused by pro-phone and irreligious persons. He also endeavoured to prove, that the Occasional and Schism Acts, were, in effect, persecuting laws; and that by admitting the principle of self-defence and self-preservation in matters of religion, aU the persecutions of the Heathens against the Christians, and even the popish inquisition, may be justified. As to the power of which some clergymen appeared so fond and so jealous, he owned, that the desire of power and riches is natural to all men; but that die bad learned both from reason and the gospel, that this desire must keep within due bounds, and

He was, however, neglected though made rector of Streatbam, Surrey, by Mrs. Howland, till the reign of George the First, when he was in 1715 raised to the see of Bangor. Party disputes, however, and the fear of his personal enemies, detained him in the metropolis, so that he never visited hfe bishopric. At this time his sermon on this words, ‘ My kingdom is not of this world, ’ produced a violent dispute for many years, known by the name of the Bangorian Controversy, which, though at first attacked the temporal power only of the clergy, soon extended to the righto of princes. In this controversy he had for opponents, Dr. Snape, and the still more formidable William Law, who in some points triumphed in the geoend opinion over hint. From Bangor he was translated to Hereford, and afterwards to Salisbury, and lastly to Winchester, where he continued 36 years. He died 17th April 1761, aged 65, and was buried in Winchester Cathedral, where a neat monument, with a .Latin inscription, written by himself, records the events of his life.

Mot intrench upon the rights and liberties of ear fellow-creatures and countrymen.

The Bishop of Bristol, who spoke next, on the opposite side, chiefly urged, That the late king William having recommended to both Houses from the throne, that they would leave room for the admission of all Protestants that were willing and able to serve; and a clause having thereupon been offered to beinserted in a bill, depending in the Lords' House, to take away the necessity of receiving the Sacrament, to make a roan capable of enjoying any office, employment, or place of trust; the said clause was rejected by a great majority, as wall as another clause (offered also to be inserted in the said bill) to prevent the receiving the Saerament of the LortFs Supper upon any other account, than in obedience to the holy institution thereof: adding, ' that soon after, the Lords addressed to king William, That he would maintain the aburchof England as bylaw established; all Which his lordship applied to the presentt case, and so voted against the bill. He was answered by

The Bishop of Gloucester^who among other

things, 'endeavoured to wipe off the imputation of hypocrisy cast on the Dissenters. He was backed by

The Bishop of Lincoln, J who made an historical deduction of the business in question, and artfully commended the zeal of a noble, earl, when secretary of state, in promoting a comprehension, according to king William's desire. He also took notice, that religion was ever used, by ersifty men, as a blind and pretence to carry on political designs; and he remembered in particular, in the late reign, that while our arms were victorious abroad, the church was in danger at home; but no sooner was a stop pnt to that glorious war, than the church was m a flourishing condition. The Bishop of Lincoln having done speaking,

v The Earl of Nottingham, who was hinted at by that prelate, and who was the promoter of the Occasional Bill, and had opposed the bill now in question, thought it proper to justify his conduct; which his lordship did, by saying be was in those days but a young man, and had wanted opportunities to know the Dis* senters, which be had since, and found them to be an obstinate sort of people, never to be satisfied:after which his lordship entered upon the merits of the bill and voted against it.

The Bishop of London did the same, and urged, That in wise governments, all offices and places of trust are in the hands of those df the national church, which iiis lordship confirmed by what is practised in Sweden.

. The Bishop of Rochester^ spoke also on the same side, and said, in substance, That he -wns not in the House at the first reading of this Bill; but that the last session of parliament he foresaw from the bill about an Alms-House at Bristol, and the bill for applying part of thu fund for the building of new Churches, to the rebuilding of an old one (St. Giles’s) both which he bad opposed, that1 something of this nature would be attempted. That he was sorry he had been a. prophet, since, in his opinion, this bill overturned the foundation of the security of the Church. That this lull even struck at the Act of Uniformity, which was confirmed'by the Act of Union, and so was levelled against the Church of Scotland, as well as against the Church of England: for which reason he hoped those peers who represented the nobility of Scotland would be against this bill, particularly noble lord, who was too great an enemy to priestcraft to suffer himself to be assembly-ridden. His lordship, by way of commination, concluded that we live ia' a changeable country, and the hardships which the Dissenters bring now upon the church, may one day or other be severely and with more justice retaliated upon them.

He was educated at Westminster school, and entered at Edmund bally Oxford, where he applied himself with unusual perseverance to study, and published his Letter from a Student, concerning the approaching parliament, a political pamphlet, which gave great offence to the Whig party. In 1699, he took his degree of D. D. and the next year, unsolicited, was appointed minister of St. Botolph, Aldgate, London.

•uajy for the Bill, and said, in substance, That he did not design to reflect on any of his brethren for speaking against this bill, because he supposed they did it out of a sincere zeal for the Church; that for his own part, he did not believe this bill to be against (he church, but rather for its advantage and security, and therefore he was for it. That he observed from his tory, that the church was most safe and flourishing, when the clergy did not atfect more power than falls to their share, and were tender of the rights and liberties of their fellow-subjects; but that when the clergy promoted arbitrary measures and persecutions, as some did in king Charles the lst’s reign, they first brought scandal and contempt upon the clergy, and, at last, ruin both upon church and state. Then he shewed the abuse of the word Church, which in a true sense, is venerable, and illustrated the matter by the words ‘ holy, ’and ‘ the temple of the Lord/ which were sacred among the Jews; but when those words came to be abused so far, as to countenance rebellion, as in the case of Dathau, Corah, and<Abiram, and other wicked practices, then they rather became words of execration. That in like manner pmongst us, the words ‘ church/ and the

* church’s danger/ had often been made use of to carry on sinister designs, and then these words made a mighty noise in the mouth of silly women and children; but that in his opinion the church, which he defined to be a scriptural institution upon a legal establishment, was founded upon a rock, and could not be in danger, as long as we enjoyed the light of the gospel, and our excellent constitution. After this he gave his reasons tor his being for this bill, and animadverted upon three things that had been advanced by other prelates, viz. 1st, That the

* Dissenters got more than.the church by the ‘ Revolution, though they had the least share in

* it.' For his lordship shewed they only got a toleration, which they might have had under king James, if they would have complied wirhhis measures; whereas the Church secured all she now enjoys, which would have been irrecoverably lost, had not the Revolution happened. 2dly, ‘That the churchmen, and even the

* clergy, shewed more affection to the present ‘government than the Dissenters, during the c late rebellion to which he answered, that by the laws which by this, hill were to be repealed, the Dissenters were then under an incapacity to serve the government, which evinced the necessity of this bill; and as for a clergyman who had given signal proofs of his zeal for the government in the north, that it was well known he was never rewarded for it, hut rather disregarded ever since by his neighbours. 3d)y, As

plated- He wrote the third volume of A Complete History of England, ’ published by the booksellers 1706, besides A Vindication of the Church; A Letter to the Editors of Som-eer’s Treatise of the Roman Posts, &c.; Sermons, &c.

to what had been suggested, ‘ That all office *

‘ and places of trust ought to be in the hands of those of the established church/ he said, be hoped they should never draw precedents from Sweden. Concluding, with returning thanks to the lay-lords, for bearing so long and so pa* tiently with that bench, leaving the issue of this debate to their judgments; and only taking notice, that as the wisdom of Solomon never more eminently appeared, than in discovering the true mother of the child, so their lordships might easily know the reason, why some persons spoke with so much tenderness for the acts which by this bill were to be repealed.

The Bishop of Chester was of the contrary, opinion, and in particular, excepted against a clause in the bill; whereby a punishment of* censure was to bf inflicted on such clergymen, •as should refuse to administer the sarrament to any that desired to receive it, which he said was against the canons of the church. The spiritual lords having done speaking,

Lord Lansdown fstood up, and spoke as follows:

* Dr. Francis Gastrell.

jy ‘ Lord Lausdown, who descended from a family which traced its ancestry to the first duke of Normandy, was himself grandson of the famous sir Bevil Granville, who lost his life so heroically at the battle of X>ansdown in 1643; He received his first tincture of education in France under the tuition of sjr William Ellis, is man of letters. In 1677, in the tenth year of his age, he was entered at Trinity college, Cambridge; and in 1679 recited a copy ot his own verses to the princess Mary d’Est£ of-Modena, then duchess of York, when she visited the unn versity. In 1680 he was admitted to the den gree of master of arts, and left college soon afn ter. At the accession of James the 2nd he addressed the new monarch in three short metrical panegyrics, which were commended by Waller, whose praise auimated the young poet to breathe a rapture of acknowledgment,

“ Iu numbers such as Waller’s self might use."

“ He had early imbibed principles of loyalty, and was with difficulty prevented from taking up arms in defence of his sovereign, both at the time of Monmouth’s rebellion, and at the Revolution. On the latter occasion he expressed his manly feelings in a letter to his father, which has been printed by Dr. Anderson. Having no public employment, and possessing but a contracted fortune, he lived in retirement dur*? ing the reign of king William, devoted to literary avocations, the fruits of which appeared in his plays and jioems. By a laudable economy he preserved himself at the same time from those embarrassments which in more advanced life he is said to have incurred. Having received a considerable addition to his finances by the death of his father and uncle, he became a representative for Fowey, in Cornwall, in 1702, and continued to serve iu parliament till 1710, when he was made secretary at war in th *

“ X always understood that the toleration was meant as an ease to tender consciences, and not an indulgence to hardened ones. The not to prevent Occasional Conformity corrects only a particular crime of particular men; it concerns no other set of Dissenters, but those followers of Judas, who came to the lord’s Supper to sell and betray him; this crime, however palliated or defended, even by some reverend fathers of the church, is no less than making the God of Truth, as it were in person subservient to acts of hypocrisy; no less than sacrificing the mystical body and blood of our Saviour to worldly and sinister purposes.

On the accession of George the 1st he was. removed, from his offices, and his Tory connexions prevented his being employed in that or the succeeding reign.

In 1719 he made an ardent speech against the practice of occasional conformity, part of which

He now appeared at court, where he was well received by queen Caroline, to whom and to the princess Anne he presented his splendid volumes, with verses on the blank leaves, which concluded his poetical labours.

“ It is very surprizing to hear the merit of Dissenters so highly extolled and magnified within these walls; for who is he amongst us, that cannot tell of some ancestor either sequestered or murdered by them. It is notoriously known, that they brought the Royal Martyr to the block; but to extenuate that guilt in favour of the Presbyterians, it seems to be insinuated by a very learned, lord, that they performed good offices at last, and were instruments of the Restoration. What offices, what instruments, upon what terms did they resort to the king? Upon no better than their brethren the Scot6 bad iirvited him before, to have an insignificant tool of a king, a cypher of a king, to walk in their leading-strings. To restore themselves, not him to dominion, was their only aim: they groaned under the oppression of other sectaries, after having been themselves the greatest oppressors of mankind: nor bad they any other means of arriving at deliverance (or revenge rather) but by recovering royal power under a nominal king. This, general Monk well knew, who was privy to their in* trigues, and hence arose all the difficulties that incumbered him in the prosecution of his own scheme: he was lender a necessity of making use of their discontent, and could neither intirely trust or throw them off: hut that the monarchy was restored free and independent, the Church re-established pure and undefiled, was owing to his virtue and good conduct: uo thanks to the Presbyterians.

“ Nor was king Charles scarce warm in his throne, before they broke out into a new rebellion, and continued incessant disturbers of his whole reign, some)iiues with sham plots, and sometimes with real ones..

“ It was like* ise observed by the same learned lord, that they were hardly used, fined, banished, and imprisoned. Be it so, but it was not upon a religious account; they might be punished for breach of the law, disturbing the public peace, for illegal meetings and assemblies, and other state crimes; but what was there more in that than the present case of the Non jurors?

. “ The clemency of that reign, even to Dissenters, has been sufficiently vindicated by a noble earl, (the earl of Nottingham) who was called up, by some reflections which fell from a reverend prelyte, to give an account of the intended comprehension. The Church opened her arms, the clergy and prelates, the king condescended-to invite jbem with all the temptations of indulgence and Christian chaFity; but what was the return ? Nothing but a morose haughty deportment, severe contradictions or sullen evasions; they scorned to enter our churches its brethren and fellow-Christians,

but as conquerors and plunderers; they have no grace but what is founded in dominion. Their behaviour in the subsequent reign of king James, is fresh iif every one's memory; that unhappy prince was undone by giving attention to iheir Addresses, and depending uj>on their promises.

“ But it is said they-have been not only quiet since, but have appeared zealous for the present establishment, and no wonder: for who but themselves or their favourers, have been thought worthy to he countenanced.

* A noble lord inquiring into the reason of the present universal discontent (for such I find it is agreed to be oh all hands) has been pleased to impute it to misconduct in the administration; a bttle unluckily, I confess, since it was answered, That at the time when that discontient most flamed, his lordship himself was at the head of the administration.

“ Another noble lord very deservedly in a high station, charged it upon fate, the malignity'of the stars, a certain unaccountable disposition in the heavens, for which there is no apparent reason nor remedy.

“ But tl/ reason is plain, flagrant and notorious; the early impatience and presumption of Dissenters, their insolent and undissembled expectations, their open insults of the clergy, their fixing bills on our churches with this scandalous Inscription, A House to be Lett Their public Vindication of the murder of king Charles; their vile reflections on the memory of queen Anne, for ever dear to the people of England; besides-many other indecent arrogant provocations (too many to enumerate) was too much to bear, ay that the violences that ensued let the aggressors answer for: but then their acting all this Hot only with impunity, but with a reward out of the public treasure, was more than a sutficidht ground for jealousy.

uA noble duke seemS ^Ith some warmth to have taken offence, that the Roman Catholics and Dissenters have been mentioned in the debate upon the same level, whereas their religion is lii^h treason. But I never yet understood (hut their religion was high treason; indeed I have heard that it might fee high treason to make converts to it; and by the same reason the reformed religion may be high treason in Popish countries. But if we may compare them with the Dissenters, upon a fcot of merit with respect to the government, the Catholics, as far as has been yet made to appear, have infinitely the advantage. To whom do we owe our Magna Charta ? To our ancient barons unreformed; and were there not as many strucgles for liberty before the Reformation as since ?

“.To whom do we owe the Revolution hut to Catholic powers ? Even the Pope himself united to encourage and support the prince of Orange in his undertaking.

“ To whom do we owe bur present security in the Protestant establishment, but to the most potent, the most arbitrary, the most famous for persecution of all tlve Popish powers, the most inveterate and implacable enemies of

the Protestant persuasion, France, Savoy, and the Emperor? And have not the ministers, one after another, assured tts, that these mortat enetnies to our souls in another world, are out only guarantees for our salvation in this ?

“ Our Protestant brethren, the States, were neither consulted nor intrusted, but seeni to have been* left like slaves to follow the dictates of Great Britain and France, and to accede implicitly at their peril; they have however thought fit hithertor to contmue' Dissenters, though perhaps theymay in time occasionally conform, as circumstances may happen to press. But till then, our only trusty allies are our good Catholic friends.

“ If any man can say as much for the Dissenters, let him speak; the reverend prelates who have exerted in this debate, having been •prepared to fulminate against the Test, without being admitted into the secret of withdrawing the question, have untortunately employed their quivers in the air.

“ One indeed there is, who must not be forgot, who wandering beyond the rest in a long historical collection, from pamphlets and libels, has let himself loose against the sacred memory of the royal Martyr; ne has accused him, if not of all popery, of half popery, very near popery, almost alt popery; why would he not speak out ? For what means thisj school distinction, betwixt almost all a papist, and quite. Hard fate of the best of men and of kings !

“ He who renounced the purple to preserve the lawn, who died for the Church, and who is commemorated as a martyr for the Church, is yet exposed within an age after his descent from the scaffold to the grave, to be murdered over again in fame, even in the supreme court of judicature, by a successor in that venerable order, that very episcopacy, for which be sacrificed his liberty, his life, his crown !

“ The execrable wretch who severed his head from his body, performed the inhuman office in a mask; but this holy executioner, who cuts what the axe could not hurt, what the regicides could not take from him, his good name, has not been ashamed to attempt it bare-faced. It grieves me that this animadversion should fall to my lot, to the lot of any private lord:I was in hopes a general indignation would have warmed this noble assembly, to have made it their own act to reprehend such irreverend slanders, as would have much better become a descendent from Bradshaw, than a successor of Laud:but I ask pardon, this unlucky reflection may have transported roe too far. In a word, that I may not appear prejudiced-to merit in any man, I will conclude, with this motion, that a list be laid before us of such Dissenters by name, as have in any kind merited from the public, and I will most'readily come into any measures that may distinguish them and their particular service. God forbid but. that they should all have their deserts.”

A little past six in the evening, the question was called for, and as some other Temporal

Lords were going to speak to it, the eftrl of Aylesford njoved for adjourning the debate till the neat day, which was agreed to.

Dec. 19. The Lords resumed the adjourned debate; and the House being cleared of all strangers, the earls of Aylesford, Nottingham and Cowper, the duke of .Devonshire, the lord viscount Tpwnshend, the lord Trevor, the lord-archbishop of Canterbury, the lord bishop of .Rochester, and some other's, made speeches against (he bill; but were answered by the earls of Sunderland and Stanhope, dukes of Newcastle, Kent, and Roxburgh, the lord Chohnon-deley, the bishop of Norwich ; * and the question being at last put, whether the Bill be committed, it was carried in the affirmative by a majority of 86 voices against 68, viz.

, Content - - 67 Npt Content, 50; Proxies, - - 19 — 86 Proxies - 18 — 68

Dec. 20. The Lords, in a grand committee examined and went through the Bill, paragraph by paragraph, and the reasons offered by vearl Cowper, and some other peers, had so much •weight, that some clauses derogatory to the Test and Corporation acts were agreed to be left out. Then the question being put, That this Bill, thus amended, be reported the Monday following; it was carried in the affirmative T>y 55 voices against 33. Accordingly, on the 22d, the said amendments were reported, agreed to, and the Bill ordered to be’engrossed; and the next day it was read the third time, passed, and sent down to the Commons, after which the Lords adjourned to the 7th of January.

The King's Message on declaring War with

Spain.] Dec. 17. Mr, Boscawen, by his majesty’s command-, acquainted the House, “ That •all his majesty’s endeavours, and those of the most Christian king, to procure redress of the many iqjuries done to the subjects of Great-.Britain by the. king of Spain, to the unspeakable detriment of the trade of these kingdoms; ar even to obtain a discontinuance of the unjust hostilities carrying on by that crown, baying proved ineffectual, his majesty had found it necessary to declare War with Spain.”

_ Debate in the Commons on the War with After the reading of this Message,

Mr. Trebymoved, “ That an humble Address •be presented to his majesty, to return his majesty the most unfeigned Thanks of the House for having communicated to them the necessary resolution of declaring War against Spain; and to asspre his majesty, that this House will, with the greatest cheerfulness and with the utmost vigour, assist and support his majesty in the war with the king of Spain, until Spain, is reduced to accept of reasonable terms of peace and to agree to such conditions of trade and commerce, as this nation is justly intitled to by their several treaties.”

member for Sudbury, but Mr. Shippen, Mr’ Freeman, sir TtiQinqsHanmer, and some others’ excepted either against the, motion or against some expressions in it, which occasioned a warm debate. Some members alledging, “ That they did not see the necessity of declaring war against Spain, and that they rather were inclined to believe that the grievances complained of by our merchants might have been redressed in an amicable manner, ”

Colonel SlanAape, member for Derby, told the House, that he had bad the honour to serve his majesty as his envoy to the king of Spain, and he could assure them, that he hud present-^ ed at least five ancf twenty Memorials to tlis^t court, in relation to. the complaints of our merchants, without any success. Hereupon

Mr. Methuen, member for Brackley, inter-

posed, and accounted for the dilatorines6 of the court of Madrid in the dispatch of commercial affairs, occasioned by the different regulations and judicatories in the several kingdoms, provinces, and ports of Spain; which might be the reason why the grievances complained of by our traders had not been redressed so soon as might have heen expected.

A member having hinted that the. ministers had shewn no great concern for the trade and interest of the nation, since it appeared by the Answer, from a Secretary of State, to the Marquis de Monteleone’s Letter, that they would havep&ssed by the violations of theTraties of Commerce, provided Spain had accepted the terms of the Quadruple Alliance:that his majesty did not seek to aggrandize himself by any new acquisition, but was rather inclined to sacrifice something of his own to procure the general quiet and tranquillity; that nobody could yet tell how far that sacrifice was to extend, hut certainly it was a very uncommon piece of condescension;

Mr. Shippen went yet farther, and insinuated

that this war seemed to be calculated for another meridian. But wrapt up the innuendo so dextrously, that no exception was taken at it.

Mr. Horatio Walptte also found faulf with the Treaty of Quadruple Alliance, particularly as to the disposition of Sicily in favour of the emperor, which was a breach of the Treaty of Utrecht; and his brother

Mr. Robert Walpole Exclaimed against the injustice of attacking the Spanish fleet before the Declaration of War.

They were answered by Mr. Craggs, Mr. Lechmere, Mr. Aislabie and Mr. T. Broderick.

Sir Joseph Jekyll said, That some weeks before, when this affair was first mentioned in the House, he was shy of giving his opinion, because be bad not then examined the several steps that had been taken in it; but that now he was fully convinced, that if there was any injustice, it was on the side of the king of Spain; and that the conduct of his majesty and his ministers was entirely agreeable to the law of nations and the rules of justice and equity. Was it just, added lie, in the king of

PARL. HISTORY, 5 George

Spain to attack the emperor's dominions [meaning Sardinia] while he was engaged in a war with the Turks, without any declaration of war? Was it just in the same prince to invade the dominions of one of our allies, the king of Sicily, without the least provocation? And was it not just in his majesty to .vindicate the faith of his Treaties, and to defend and protect the trade of his subjects, which had been violently oppressed ?

Then the question being put upon Mr. Treby’s motion, the same was carried in the affirmative by 178 against 107; and it was resolved, That the said Resolution be laid before his majesty, by the whole House; which being done accordingly his majesty gave the following Answer:

“ Gentlemen;

“ This seasonable and loyal. Address, will, I trust in God, contribute effectually to what you desire. I return you true Thanks for it.”

The Lords1 Address on the Declaration of War with Spain.] Dec. 16. Earl Stanhope, having communicated to the House of Peers the like Message, relating to the Declaration of War, and moved for an Address of Thanks to his majesty thereupon; he was seconded andl backed by several lords. A poble peer only suggested, That before they gave sanction to a step of so nice a nature, and of so great importance, it were proper to consider whether the same was consonant to treaties; and therefore moved that a day might be appointed for that purpose. To this my lord Stanhope answered, That he had five weeks before; by his majesty’s command, laid the several Treaties relating to this affair, before the House, so that all the members of that noble assembly had sufficient time to peruse and examine the same: But, however, after the Address, which lie had moved, had been presented, he would readily give his Vote for appointing a day to consider of the said Treaties. And he durst answer before hand, that upon the strictest examination it would be found, that his majesty and his ministers had done nothing either against the faith of Treaties, or the honour and interest of the nation. Hereupon, it was carried, without any further opposition, and without dividing, That an Address of thanks be presented to his majesty; which Address was, accordingly, immediately drawn up, and, the same day, presented to his majesty, as follows:

“ Most G racious Sovereign;

a We your majesty’s moat dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in parliament assembled, do return your majesty our most humble Thanks, for having acquainted vs with the Resolution your majesty has taken of-declaring War against Spain: And as this House has already promised your majesty, that they would stand by and support youin the vigorous pursuit of those prudent and necessary measures, your majesty has taken to secure the trade and quiet of theye kingdoms; and

the tranquillity of Europe, so, upon this occa* sion, we beg leave to give your majesty the strongest assurances of our firm and steady re? solution to assist your majesty with the utmost zeal in the prosecution of the present war against Spain.”

The Kingfs Answer.] To which his majesty

returned this Answer:

“My Lords;

“ I return you my hearty thanks for this Address, and for the assurances you give me, of your steady resolution to support and assist me in the prosecution of this War against Spain.”

Debate in the Commons on the Bill for strengthening the Protestant Interest.] Dec.

24. The engrossed Bill from the Lords, intir tied, ‘ An Act for strengthening the Protestant ‘ Interest in these Kingdoms, ’was brought down to the Commons, who read it the first time, and ordered it to be read a second time, on the 7th of January, to which day the House then adjourned.

January 7, 1719. The Commons read a second time the engrossed Bill from the Lords, intitled, ‘ An Act for strengthening the Protes-‘ tant Interest in these Kingdoms: And then so much of the act, Against Occasional Con-*formity, * as was intended to be repealed by the said Bill, as also of the act, ‘To prevent the ‘ Growth of Schism, * &c. both which were passed in the 12th year of the late queen Anne, were read. After which, upon a motion made to commit the said Bill, there arose a very warm debate, that lasted from one o’clock, till half an hour past nine in the evening*. Mr. Hampden, treasurer of the navy, spoke first in behalf of the Bill, and was seconded by -Mr* Cartwright, member for Bossiney. The other members who spoke for the committing of the Bill, were Mr. J. Chetwynd, sir Tho. Palmer; Mr. Yonge, Mr. Carter, sir William Thompson, Mr, Boscawen, Mr. Barrington Shute, sir William Lowther, sir Joseph Jekyll, sir Gilbert Heajhcote, Mr. Cruggs, Mr. Lechtnere, and the lord Castlecomer. Against the commit? ting of the Bill; Mr. Graham, Mr. Ward, Mr. Richard Hopton, col. Strangeways, Mr. Blun-del, sir William Wyndham, Mr. Jefferies, Mr. Shippen, Mr. Horatio Walpole, sir Tho. Han-mer, Mr. John Smith, Mr, Snell, Mr. Robert Walpole, and Mr. Lutwyche.

Sir William Thompson urged, That the Schism Bill deprived parents of their natural right of, educating their children as they think proper; to which

Mr. Shippen answered, That it was somewhat strange to see so able a lawyer inconsistent with himself: For when the twelve judges were

consulted, in a case relating to a great family,

* “ It is impossible to relate all that was offered on both sides on this occasion; the rather because, excepting his royal highness the Prince of Wales, and some noble peers, no strangers were this day admitted into tho House.” Political State,

(the Prince of Wales’s children) he was of the opinion of ten of them, ' ‘ That children may be

* taken from their parents, and educated as the

* good of the nation required/ To this

Sir William Thompson replied; That as he never was conshlted, so had he never declared his thoughts in the nice case hinted by that gentleman, and therefore he could not, with any colour of justice, be said to have changed his opinion: but that the member who taxed him with it, and whp thereby declared against the opinion of the ten Judges, if he would be consistent with himself, must now be for the Bill that repeals the Schism act, which restores parents to their natural rights.

After some personal altercation between Mr. R. Walpole and Mr. Leehmere, the question being put upon the motion for committing the Bill, it was carried in the Affirmative by 243 votes against 202, and the Bill was committed to a committee of the whole House. The following is

the going info a Committee of the whole House upon the Bill from the Lords, For strengthening the Protestant Interest, * &c. the lord Guenisey moved, “ That it be an instruction to the said Committee, that they have power to receive a Clause, That any person when he comes to tpkethe Oath of Abjuration and other baths; subsequent to the receiving the Sacrament, in order to his qualification, shall acknowledge that the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament were given by Divine Inspiration, and shall acknowledge his firm faith and belief in the ever-blessed Trinity :* but the previous question being put, that the question Jbe now put upon the said motion, it passed in the negative, by 90 voices; several members who voted against the Bill, For strength- ening the Protestant Interest, * &c. having, notwithstanding their opposition to that Bill, voted also against thei amendment proposed by lord Guernsey. Then the House resolved itself-into a grand committee upon the said Bill, went through thfe same, and resolved to pass it without aray amendment, by a majority of 221 votes against 170.

Jan. 10. The Bill was read the third time* passed, and sent back to the Lords.

Debate in the Lords on the State of the Peerage.] February 28. The Duke of merset r6se, and represented, that the number of Peers being, of late years, very much increased, especially since the Union of the two kiugdoms, it seemed absolutely necessary to fix the same, both to preserve the dignity of Peerage, and to prevent the inconveniencies that may attend the creation of a great number of Peers to ierve a present purpose, of which they had a remarkable instance'in the late .reign:he therefore moved for the bringing in a Bill to settle and limit the Peerage, in such & manner, “ That the number of English Peers should not be enlarged beyond six above the present'nuin her, which upon failure of male issue might be supplied by new creations:That instead of the Sixteen elective peers in Scotland, 25 be made hereditary on the part of that kingdom, whose number, upon failure of heirs male, should be supplied by some other Scotch peers.

The Duke of Argyle seconded this motion; which wns also backed by the earls of Sunderland and Carlisle; hut the last of these added. That this was a matter of so great importance, that it became the wisdom of that aUgust assembly maturely to consider of it, before they came to any Resolution; and thereupon his lordship moved, “That a day may be appointed, for the House to be in a Committee, to take into consideration the present State of the Peerage of Great Britain.* ’

The Earl of Oxford excepted against the duke"

of Somerset’s proposal, and among other things, said, That as it tended to takeaway the brightest gem from the crown, it was matter of wonder to see it supported by those, who, by the great employments they enjoyed, sec med under

‘1719. — on the State of the Peeragei i- [590

the strictest obligation to take care of the royal prerogative; that therefore there must be a secret meaning in this motion; that for his own part, 'though be expected nothing from the crown, yet he would never give his vote for lopping off so valuable a branch of the prerogative, because this would put it out of the power of the crown to reward merit and virtuous action^. To this

The Earl of Sunderland answered, That though the number of peers were limited, yet the crown would still be the fountain of honour, and preserve its prerogative of creating new Peers, nppn the extinction of old titles, for want of male issue, which happened frequently; and that those extinctions would give the prince on the throne sufficient opportunities to bestow honours upon commoners of distinguished merit and abilities. His lordship concluded with backing the earl of Carlisle’s motion, and no member opposing it, the debate was adjourned accordingly, till the second of March; for which day the Lords were summoned.

The King's Message relating to the .]

March 2. Earl Stanhope delivered to the House the following Message from the King.

« G. R.

“ His majesty being informed, that the House of Peers have under consideration the state of the Peerage of Great Britain, is graciously pleased to acquaint this House, that he has so much at heart the settling the Peerage of the whole kingdom, upon such a foundation, as may seoure the freedom and constitution of arliament in all future ages, that he isr willing is prerogative stand not in the way of so great and necessary a work.”

Further Debate in the Lords on the State of the Peerage.] Then a motion, being made

for an Address of Thanks for the said Message, ;

The Earl of Nottingham excepted against-it, saying, It was unusual for the king to take notice of any thing depending in parliament, before the same was laid before his majesty in a parliamentary way.

The Duke of Buckingham overruled this objection, and said, It could not be supposed, that the king alone should be ignorant of what every body else knew; and that since his majesty was pleased, for the good of his subjects, to suffer his prerogative to be restrained, they ought readily to accept, and thankfully to acknowledge so great and so gracious a condescension.

Hereupon it was agreed, without dividing, to present an Address of Thanks to his majesty; but some words having passed between the earls of Sunderland and Oxford about this extraordinary Message, the House thought fit to interpose, and require from them, that the whole affair should go no farther, and the intended debate was adjourned to the next day.

591] FARL. HISTORY, 5 Georob I. 1719. — respecting the Peerage. [&2

March 3. The Lords, in a committee of the whole House, of which the earl of Clarendon was chairman, took into consideration the present State of the Peerage of Great Britain.

The Earl of Sunderland ran over the several changes that have happened in the Peerage since the reign of queen Elizabeth to this time; urging the necessity of limiting the number of peers, and demonstrated the advantage of the scheme proposed by the ‘duke of Somerset.

Earl Cozvper endeavoured to shew, that what

was intended to be done, with relation to the /Scots peerage, was a manifest violation of the Treaty of Union, and the highest piece of injustice; for it was no less than to . deprive persons of their right without being beard, and without any pretence of forfeitqre upon their part, urging, That the Scots peers, who should be excluded from the number of the twenty five hereditary, would be in a worse condition than any other subjects, since they would neither be electing nor elected, neither representing nor represented, which could not fail of raising dangerous discontents amongst them; that, besides, it would be a breach of trust in those who represented the Scots peerage, wholly to divest their principals of a power, with which they had entrusted then! only for a few years; and therefore his lordship was of opinion, that the Scots peers ought to have been consulted, before any steps were made in so nice and so important an affair.

These objections were replied to by the earls of Sunderland and Stanhope, Cholmondeley and Poulet, the dukes of Buckingham and Newcastle, the bishop of Gloucester, and some Other English lords, who were supported by several Scots peers, particularly the dukes of Roxburgh and Montrose, the marquis of Annandale, and the earl of Hay. In the first place, it was alledged, That the settling the eerage in the manner proposed, was rather a enefit than a disadvantage to the Scots peerage, whose representatives were thereby increased by nine, and all made hereditary; and as for those peers who for the present would be excluded, they, would afterwards have a chance to come in, upon failure of any of the twenty five:That yhis regulation could not be looked upon as a> violation of the Union, two things only being made unalterable fundamentals pt that contract, viz. religion, and the pro-

portion of public taxes: to prove which, several Articles of the Act of Union were read: and that the consulting of the Scots peers in this affair, would be altogether improper and unparliamentary, and attended with great inconveniencies.

The Earl of Hay, in particular, represented, That the bringing in a number of peers into that House by election, was certainly derogatory to the dignity of that august assembly, and of the highest tribunal in the united kingdom; and therefore he had long before wished to see this defect in the Union rectified, and the Scots pears freed from that ignominious mark of dis-

tinction, which made them be looked upon as dependent on the court and ministry, and not at liberty to vote, like the other members, for the good and interest of their country.

The Earl of Nottingham and the lord Townshend declared. That they were not against limiting the peerage, but only against the doing it in a manner, which, in their opinion, w as unjust, and might be attended with dangerous consequences.

Resolutions of the Lords in relation to the Peerage.] But after a debate that, lasted till near seven of the clock in the evening, by a majority of 83 votes against 30, their lordships came to the following Resolutions, viz.

“ 1. That in lieu of the 13 elective peers, to sit in this House on the part of Scotland, 95

Eeers to be declared by his majesty, shall have ereditary seats in parliament, and be the peers on the part of the peerage of Scotland.

“ 2. That such 25 peers shall be declared by his majesty, before the next session of parliament.

“ 3. That 9 of the said 25 shall be appointed by his majesty to have immediate right to such hereditary seats in parliament, subject to the qualifications requisite by the laws now in being.

“ 4. That none of the remaining 16 so to be declared by his majesty, or their heirs, shall become sitting peers of the parliament of Great Britain, until after the determination of this present parliament, except such are of the number of the 16 peers now sitting in parliament on the part of Scotland, and their heirs.

“ 5. That if any of the 25 peers so to be declared by his majesty, and their heirs shall fail, some one or other of the peers of Scotland shall be appointed by his majesty, his heirs and successors, to succeed to every such peer so failing; and every peer so appointed shall be one of the peers on the part of the peerage of Scotland, in the parliament of Great Britain, and so, toties quoties, as often as such failure shall happeu,

“ 6. That the hereditary right of sitting in parliament, which shall accrue to the 25 peers of Scotland* to be declared by his majesty, shall be so limited as not to descend to females,

“ 7. That the number of peers of Great Britain, on the part of England, shall not be enlarged, without precedent right, beyond six above what they are at present; but as any of the said preseut 'peers, or such six uew peers, in case they be created, shall fail, their numbers may be supplied by new creations of commoners of Great Britain, born within the kingdom of Great Britain or Ireland, or any of the dominions thereuuto belonging, or born of British parents, and so, toties, us

often as such failure shall happeu.

“ 8. That no person be at any time created by writ, nor any peerage granted by patent, for any longer estate than for the grantee, and the h$irs mala of his body.

u 9. That there be not any restraint upon the crown, front creating any of the princes of the blood, peers of Great Britain, with right to ait in parliament.

* 10. ThatwIJenever those Lords now sitting in parliament, whose sons have been called by writ, shall die; then it shall be lawful for his majesty, his heirs and successors, to create a peer to supply the number so lessened.

“ 11.* That every creation of a peer hereafter to be made, contrary to these Resolutions, shall be null an<jl void to all intents and purposes.”

The Peerage Bill brought in.] March 5. The Earl of Clarendon reported these Resolutions to the House, which being agreed to, the Judges were ordered to bring in a Bill thereupon; which they did accordingly on the 14th, when the said Bill was read the first, and ordered to be read a second time.

March 18, the Lords, in a grand committee, took the said bill again into consideration, but adjourned it to the 90th.

April 9. It being moved in the House 1 Lords to receive the report from-the committee of the whole House upon the Bill for settling the Peerage of Great Britain, the same was put off to the 6th, when the Amendments made to the said Bill were agreed to, and the Bill ordered to be engrossed. But on the 14th, the day appointed for the third reading, lord Stanhope^observed, That this Bill had made a great noise, and raised strange apprehensions; and since the design of it had been so'misrepresented, and so misunderstood, that it was like to meet with great opposition in the other, House, he thought it advisable to let that .matter lie still, till a more proper opportunity: And thereupon the third reading of the said Bill was, put off to the 98th of th&t month:by which Resolution the'said Bill was dropped for the present session. *

♦ Mr. Coxe, iq his Life of Sir Robert Walpole has preserved the following “ Memo random on the Peerage Bill, ” by lord chancellor Middleton:

« When the duke of Bolton first spoke to me about the matter, then under the consideration of the House of Lords, for restraining the number# of Peers, I did not relish the scheme; but refrained expressing myself more against it at that time, being told the king was acquainted with it, and that the ministry thought it very good for the kingdom; besides, he either had not then, or did not shew me the Resolutions which were intended to be moved in the House of Lords, so I was much in the dark. After the Lords had passed their Resolutions, I waited on him again, and continued of the same mind, but expressed myself determined not to debate or vote against a matter thought of such consequence; but could not be convinced of the reasonableness of the thing.

“ On the 6th of March, lord Sonderland qt Mr. Boscawen’3, desired me to see him on the Sunday morning, that he might discourse with me on this subject. At St. James’s, he explained to me the motives and inducements the ministry had to push this matter; and I then shewed my not comprehending the reason or necessity for bringing in the intended biU; but expressed myself resolved (considering my being in the king's service) not to speak or vote against the bill. His lordship seemed to think more would be expected from me; and used words of the king's being obliged to change hands, &c. but whether he meant, that he nwt! be obliged to change the ministry, if (fie bill

The Kings Speech relating to an Invasion from Spain.} March 10. The King went to the House of Peers, and the Commons attending, lie was pleased to say, That he had given orders to the Lord Chancellor to declare to both Houses, in his name and words, a matter his majesty thought of the greatest importance; whereupon the Lord Chancellor read the following speech:

“ My Lords and Gentleman,

«« Having received from our good brother and ally, the most Christian king, repeated advices, that an Invasion will suddenly be at-, tempted from Spain against my dominions, in favour of the Pretender to my crown, I have judged it convenient to make you acquainted with it, and shall, on my part, take all the necessary measures to defeat the designs of our enemies.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons, u This attempt, if it 'proceed, must engage me in some farther expences by sea and land than provision has been made for. I must therefore recommend it to you that I be enabled, in such manner as you shall judge convenient, to make the necessary dispositions for our security; and you may depend upon it, that I shall upon this.and all occasions have as much regard to the ease of my people, as shall bd consistent with their safety.

The more I consider this matter, the more I am confirmed in my opinion, that the Bill brought, into the House of Lords on 14th March, commonly called the Peerage Bill, is of that nature, that the Commons ought not 'to pass it; and after having heard the arguments offered by the duke of Bolton, lord Sunderland, lord chancellor, and all that was offered in the House of Lords, to induce them to come to the Resolutions, on which the Bill is founded, without being convinced, I think I m* not like to alter/ ’

The Kings Answer.] His Majesty’s Answer was as follows:

w My Lords; u I thank you kindly for this seasonable mark of your zeal for my person and government, which cannot fail of heartening our friends, and discouraging our enemies.”

* “ The squadron which had been fitting out some time for this expedition, sailed from Cad.is towards England, consisting of ten men of war and transport-ships, with 6,000 regular troop# on board, mostly Irish, with arms for 10 or

12,000 men. The duke of Ormoud was the conductor of this undertaking, with the title ef captain general of the king of Spain. He was to publish, in the proper places, a declaration in that king’s name, wherein, he said. That for many very good reasons, he had resolved to send part of his land and sea-force# into England and Scotland, to serve as auxiliaries to king James: what had confirmed him his resolution, was the certain advices he received, that many of the two nations, notwithstanding their strong inclination to acknowledge that prince for their sovereign, durst not openly declare for him, because they not see him supported by any of the state# Europe, who had either power or will assist them; that, to remove this difficulty, and . others that might arise, he declared he was determined to nse all his power for the restoration of a prince, in a country belonging him by undeniable right: That he hoped Providence would favour so just a cause j hut, that the fear of ill success might not hinder any person from declaring readily for him, he promised a secure retreat in his dominions, to all that should join him, and, in case they were forced to. leave their bountry, declared, that every sea or land officer should have, the same rank as be enjoyed in Great Britain, and the soldiers should be received and treated like h»s own. ’

“ These preparations had not been so secret, but the king had received timely notice tq take the necessary precautions: The duke of Orleans, in return for the same favour, had acquainted him with all he could discover, A

Debate in the Commons on the King's .]

The Commons being returned to the House, it was moved, “ That hn humble Address be presented to his majesty, to return him the dutiful and unfeigned thanks of this House for haying graciously communicated to his parliament, that he has received intelligence of an Invasion intended from Spain against these kingdoms; and to assure his majesty that this House will support him with the utmost vigour and efforts to defeat so extraordinary an attempt; and to desire that his majesty would give the necessary orders to strengthen and augment his forces by sea and land, in'such manner as be, in his great Wisdom, shall think fit; assuring his majesty that this House will effectually make good any increase of expence that shall arise from such an augmentation, and effectually enable his majesty not only to disappoint the designs of his enemies, both at home and abroad, but by the blessing of God turn them to their own confusion.”

None of the members did directly oppose the motion, only

Mr. Robert Walpole took this opportunity to find fault with the administration: particularly with respect to the sending a fleet into the Mediterranean, whilst Great Britain was left

Proclamation was published against the duke of Ormond, and the other lords that were with him, with a reward of 5,000 for seizing the duke, and of 1,000l. for each of the rest, and of 500/. for every gentleman. As the rumour of the Invasion increased, some forces were ordered into the north and into the west ofEng-land': The States General had notice to have

9,000 men ready to transport into England when occasion required; and were at the same time desired, not to suffer the suspicious embarkations of ammunition and men that were making at Amsterdam, which they agreed to, notwithstanding the endeavours of the Spanish ministers to the contrary. Above all, the naval armament against the Spanish squadron was hastened. The king’s speech had all the effect the king could expect or desire. Both Houses assured him of their support; and the Commons desired him to augment his forces by •ea and land, in such manner as be should think fit, promising to make good any increase of expence on that account. With ^hese assurances of the parliament, the king had the satisfaction to see his allies exert their zeal in Ms defence. The States sent over the 2,000 men; and the marquis de Prik, governor of the Austrian Netherlands, six battalions of Imperialists. The duke of Ornleas offered no less than 20 battalions, bat it was not thought proper to accept his offer. These precautions taken by the king were very just, but as, it happened they proved needless. The Spanish fleet came with a fair wind as far as cape Fi-nistere, when a violent storm arose, which lasted two days and two nights. The fleet was entirely dispersed, and disabled from pursuing their course.*’ Tindal.

naked, arid exposed to the insults of a pro* voked enemy abroad. He also reflected on some steps, whereby the discontents had been much encreased at home; and, among others, took notice of a bill lately brought into the House of Lords, [meaning an Act for settling the Peerage of Great Britain] which could not; fail making most-of the Scots peers implacable enemies. He added, That though he could hot forbear blaming the conduct of the minis* ters in some particulars, yet he still retained the same thoughts with respect to his majesty, and would readily concur with the House, in giving him the most hearty proofs of their zeal and affection for his majesty’s person and go* vernment; and even go so far as to give his vote] for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act, in case of necessity; but that in his opinion, it became the wisdom of that House, to know whether the advices his majesty had received1 of an intended invasion, were well grounded be *, fore they either alarmed the public, or engaged the nation in needless expences. This speech was answered by

Mr. Craggs, who said, That as to what has been suggested about the.Peerage Bill, that affair being yet depending in the other House, it was unparliamentary to take notice of it, before, it came regularly before them:But that how* ever, he would before-hand venture to say, that; as it was a most gracious condescension in his majesty, to suffer a branch of his royal prerogative to be restrained, in order to secure the, liberty of parliaments, so he doubted not, that; when that bill came down to ^hemit would be unanimously approved. That as to the advices the king had communicated to his parliament of the Invasion with which his dominions were threatened, though it was unusual for the sovereign to declare his intelligence, yet his majesty had been most graciously pleased to tell them from whence he received his in^dation.. ' That therefore it would be want Ortfespect, to question his majesty’s intelligence^- 'and he was sure no member of that House bad authority to do it. That he hoped there was no great danger from the Invasion with which they were 'threatened:but that it would be the highest piece of imprudence not to take all the necessary precautions to repel.any insults from the Spaniards, and to defeat all the designs of his majesty’s* and the nation’s enemies, both at home and abroad. And as to the conduct of his majesty’s ministers, on which that member was pleased to reflect, if a motion were made for appointing a day to inquire into the same, he would readily second it.

After this, the ^notion, for an Address to his majesty passed into an unanimous Resolution, and without losing time in drawing it up in form, it was farther resolved. That the said Resolution be laid before his majesty by the whole House; which being done accordingly tha next day, the king returned this Answer.

Mr. Freeman*t Motion for adjourning the Call of the House.] April 14. Upon reading the Order of the day for the House to be called oyer:

Mr. Freeman made a speech importing, That some weeks before, he thought it necessary that the absent members should be summoned to attend the service of the House, in order to oppose some dangerous alterations [meaning the Peerage Dill then depending ip the House of Lords] which were intended to be made; and that he observed, with a great deal of satisfaction, that the summons had not1 been ineffectual, since there was so great and so unusual an appearance of members; which shewed that all true patriots were resolved to exert their zeal and efforts in defence of our excellent constitution: But that he hoped, that by this time the danger was pretty well over, and that the contrivers of that project began already to repent it; that therefore the trouble k unnecessary to give the members he thought of calling over the House; and since they had dispatched all the public business that lay before them, they had best adjourn themselves to the 17th.

Accordingly the Call of the House was adjourned to that day; to which time likewise the House adjourned themselves.

Resolutionogainst the issuing Money out

of the Chamber of London touching £lection$.] April 17. In the House of Lords a Report was made from a committee, appointed to ex a-; mine what sums of money have been issued, or ordered to be issued out of the chamber of London, for the prosecuting, defending, or maintaining certain causes or Writs of Error in this House, " or any other causes of the like nature, for such time passed as the committee should think proper, and by what warrant or authority, and on whose application. And after debate had thereupon, the question was put, <* That it is the opinion of the House, that the Common Council of London, having issued great sums of money out of the chamber of London, iir maintaining several suits of law between citizen and citizen, relating to controverted elections-, have abused their trust, and been guilty of great partiality, and of a gross mismanagement of the oity treasure, and a violation'of the freedom of Elections in the city.” It was resolved' in the affirmative by 46 nguoslif.

Protestagainst the said Resolution.] The following Protest was entered on the Journals: “ Dissentient ’

. 1. Because no proof upon oath was made befbre the Committee, of any one of the facts mentioned in.the report; and we conceive, that without a due proof, upooLontb, being first

made, so heavy a censure ought not to b# passed on any person .whatsoever, much less o» so considerable a body as the Common Council of the city of London, who have been, on many pressing occasions, eminently serviceable to the public.

“ 2. Because the Common Council of the city of London have never been heard to the several matters of which they stand condemned by this resolution, nor have they been any way made acquainted, as far as appears to us, that they stood accused before this House of any misbehaviour whatsoever.

“ 3. Because the several matters or offences specified in, this resolution, are properly cognizable in courts of law or equity; and this resolution may, we fear, be construed as a determination of such matters as may possibly hereafter be brought again before this House judicially, by writ of error or appeal.

“ 4. Because the several sums of money mentioned in the report.to have been issued by. the Common Council out of the chamber of the City of London, in relation tp controverted elections, * might possibly, had the Common Council been heard, have appeared to have been so issued by them, in defence of their ancient rights and privileges, and io order to prevent any incroachment thereupon.

' The King's Speech at the Close of the Session.} April 18. The King came to the House or Peers, Aid, after passing- several Bills, put anf end to the session, wkh the following speech which the Lord Chancellor read to both Houses.

“ My Lords, and Gentlemen;

“Inn now come to put an dnd to this session, in which you have shewn many great and seasonable proofs of your duty and affection to my person and government, and of your care for the safety and welfare of your fellow subjects.

<* By the blessing of God on our endeavours, we have hitherto disappointed the ill designs of our enemies, who flattered themselves with success frpm our unhappy divisions.

“ We perceive, by the rash and wicked, councils which have lately prevailed in the. court of Spain, that the desperate and extra-, vagant projects, of one ambitious man, though not capable of giving fears to their neighbour*, . -may occasion to them some expence and trouble.

v “ That court, being influenced by counsels . odious and destructive to the Spaniards, who find themselves neglected apd oppressed, aftea having endeavoured to foment conspiracies and: seditions, both here and in France, and stooped to practices unusual, accompanied by manifest toes of a stile unheard of among great princes* has at last proceeded to acknowledge the Pre- tender.

etived by •vary good Briton with indignation and contempt.

“ His our happiness at this juncture, to find ourselves assisted by the greatest powers of Europe against, an enemy that has no allies, but those who would betray the governments under which they live and are protected.

* Gentlemen of the House of Commons';

« I thank you very heartily for the supplies you have granted me this year; The manner in which you have raised them, without any new burthen to my people, the great addition ynu have made to the fund for sinking the debts of the nation, the discharge Of the Exchequer Bills, and; the provision you have made to pay whatever remains justly due to foreign states and princes, are the strongest proofs of your wisdom, as well as of your zeal for my service, and the good of your country. You may observe, I have hitherto been very cautious of making use of the power you have given me, to increase our forces by sea and land. If our enemies should oblige me to a greater expence, it shall be employed for your service. This is what the trust you repose in me requires at my hands, and what I owe to •o dutiful and affectionate* a House of Commons.

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

u There being nothing more desirable, at all times, than a firm union between Proiestauts; I reflect with satisfaction upon the law you have, passed this session, which will, I hope, prove effectual tp that purpose. As it is a signal instance of moderation and indulgence in Our Established Church; ao I hope it will beget such a return of gratitude from all dissenting Protestants, as will greatly tend to her honour and security; both which I shall ever have near at heart.

«I have always looked upon the glory of a sovereign, and the liberty of the subject, as inseparable; and think it is the peculiar happiness of a British king to reign over a firte people. As the civil rights therefore, and privi? leges of all my subjects, and especially of my two Houses of Parliament, do justly chum my most tender concern; if any provision, designed to perpetuate these blessings to your posterity, remains imperfect, for want of time during this session, maturely to discuss and settle matters* of so great importance, I promise myself, you will take the first opportunity to render my wishes for your happiness complete and effectual, and to strengthen the union, which is of so much consequence to the welfare of this kingdom.

vIf the circumstances of my affairs shall allow of my going abroad this summer, I shall take the same care of your interest as if I remained here. The many negotiations which will be oa foot to restore the peace of the -North, in which the trade and tradquillity of this kingdom may be very much concerned, will make my presence there of great use to $fie my dominions; And, as in that case I

design, by the blessing of God, to meet you early next winter; I will only recommend to yon most earnestly, that, laying aside all animosities, you would, in your several countries and stations, nse your utmost endeavours to preserve the public peace, and see a due execution of the laws.”

Then the Lord Chancellor prorogued the parliament to the 19th of May following; and it was afterwards, by several prorogations, farther prorogued to the 83d of November*.

FIFTH SESSION of tub FIFTH PARLIAMENT of GREAT BRITAIN.

The Kings Speech on Opening the Session.] Nov. 23. The King went to the House of Peers with the usual state, when the Lord Chancel* lor, by his majesty’s command, read the following Speech to both Houses:

u My Lords and Gentlemen;

M Hie satisfaction, with which I always meet you, is very much increased at this time, when it has pleased Almighty God so to strengthen the arms of Great Britain and our confederates, and so to prosper our several negotiations, that, by his blessing on our endeavours, we may promise ourselves to reap very soon the fruits of our successes. I am* persuaded it will be accounted, by all my good subjects, a sufficient reward for some extraordinary expence, that all Europe, as well as these kingdoms, is upon the point of being delivered from the calamitiee of war by the mfluence of British arms and counsels. One Protestant kingdomf has aK-

* “ Soon after the prorogation ', the king declared his intention of going to Hanover, and appointed for Lords Justices, in his absence^ the archbishop of Canterbury, lord chancellor Parker, the dukes of Kingston, Argyle, Newcastle, Bolton, Marlborough, and Roxburgh, the earlsof Sunderland, Berkeley, and Stanhope* and secretary Craggs. The prince and princess of Wales, not being appointed regenu, retired into the country, and appeared no more till the king’s departure, a few days after which they came to St. James’s to see the young princesses, who kept a levee twice a week: Ana to them it was, that the Lords Justices, and a numerous appearance of foreign ministers, nobility, and gentry, made their compliments oa the king’s birth-day, Who was entered into the 60th year of his age.

“ After six months absence, the king.returned to London, the 14th of November, move respected than ever, on account of the great things he bad done for the welfare and interest of his dominions. He was received with demonstrations of the liveliest joy, and tbosowho were not forward to shew it were punished bj the populace, and the windows broken that were not illuminated. Whilst in Germany, he bad sent orders for the meeting of the parliament on the 23rd of November.” Tind&JL

ready been relieved by our seasonable interpoU l •ition; and such a foundation is laid by oar late Treaties for an. anion amongst other great Protestant powers, as will very much tend to the security of oar boly religion.

“ I believe you cannot but be surprized at the continuation of a war, where our enemies have nothing to hope, and so much to fear.. It is indeed difficult to frame any judgment of those counsels, which hare broke out of late in so many rash and ill-concerted measures: If they depend upon our divisions at home, I doubt not but in a very short time, their hopes, founded upon this expectation, will prove as vain and ill-grounded as any of their .former projects.

“ In congratulating with you oo this happy posture of affairs, I must tell you, that as I have been very just and faithful to my engagements, so I have met such frank and powerful returns of assistance from my allies, as will, I doubt not, establish a lasting friendship among us.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons;

“ You will see, by the accounts I have ordered to be delivered to you, how moderate a use I have made of the. power entrusted with me to augment my forces by sea and land. I depend upon the eminent duty and affection you have always shewn to my person and government, that you will be vigorous iu dispatching the necessary Supplies for the year: to which purpose I nave ordered the Estimates to be laid before you./ And, at the same time, I must desire you to turn your thoughts to all

Sroper means for lessening the Debts of the Fation.

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

“ Yob all must be sensible of the many undeserved and unnatural troubles I have met with during the course of my reign. Our divisions at home have gone magnified abroad, and by inspiring into some foreign powers a false opinion of our force, have encouraged them to treat us iu a manner which the crown of Great Britain shall never endure while I wear it. The trouble and expence which this hath brought upon us have been the most loudly eomplained of by those, who were the occasion of mem. But with your assistance 1 have hi-thefto got through all those difficulties, and by the continuance Of your help, I hope very soon to overcome them, since the hand of God hath so visibly been with, us in all our undertakings.

“ If the necessities of my government have sometimes engaged your duty and affection to trust mo with powers, of which you have always with good reason been jealous, the whole world must acknowledge they have been so used, as to justify the confidence you have reposed in me. And as I can truly affirm, that no prince was ever more zealous to increase his own authority, than I am to perpetuate the liberty of diy people, I hope you will think of all p/oper methods to establish and transmit to your posterity the freedom Of bur happy constitution, and particularly to secure that part which is most liable to abuse. I value myself upon be-

ing the first who hath given you au opportunity* of doing it; and I must recommend it to you, to complete those measures which remained imperfect the last session.

“ So far as human prudence can foretell, the unanimity of this session of parliament must establish, with the peace of all Europe, the glory and trade of these kingdoms on a lasting foundation. I think every man may see the end.of our labours.1 A ll I have to ask of you, is, that you would agree to be a great and flourishing people, since it is the only means by which I desire to become a happy king.”

The Lord? Address of Thanks and tion.1 As soon as the King was withdrawn and the Commons were returned to their House, the duke of Manchester made a motion for an Ad- dress of Thanks and Congratulation to his majesty; and being seconded by the earl of Hob< derness, the same was unanimously agreed t<ty the archbishop of Canterbury only desiring that a clause might be added to the said Address, to acknowledge his majesty's seasonable interposition in favour of the Protestants abroad, which was readily complied with. The Address was as follows:

“Most Gracious Sovereign:

“ We, your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Loids Spiritual and Temporal in parliament assembled, beg leave to congratulate your majesty, on your safe and happy return to this kingdom, and upon the great success with which it has pleased God to bless the Wise measures taken by your majesty, to procure and establish peace in Europe.

M It is with the .utmost pleasure and satisfaction, that we see the present happy union between your majesty and the jother great Protestant powers, which dobs so visibly tend to the security of our holy religion:and We desire-to express the deep sense which we have of yonr majesty’s seasonable interposition, for the poor persecuted Protestants abroad; and we humbly beseech your majesty, that you would be pleased to continue your powerful protection and offices in favour of them.

“ We also beg leave to assure your majesty, that we will, to the utmost of our power, stand by and support your majesty, id.the prosecu^ tion of such measures as you shall think farther necessary to take, for the completing the great ends your majesty has in view, for the security df trade and glory of these kingdoms, and the general tranquillity of all Europe: and we promise ourselves, that the whole world will soon be convinced with how little foundation the enemies of your majesty and your kingdom# have flattered themselves to reap any benefit from our inte tine divisions.

“ We should be wanting in our duty to yottr majesty and our country, if we did not return your majesty our most hearty Thanks, for that tender and unprecedented care an'd colicem your majesty has been pleased to express, in youf most gracious Speech IroortHe <hrone, for the liberties df your people; and the freedom of

our happy constitution; which must necessarily draw all suitably returns of the utmost gratitude from all your majesty’s faithful subjects, who have a true value for such inestimable blessings.”

The Kings Answer.] To this Address the King gave the following Answer:

“ My Lords; *

“ The sense you express, in this dutiful Address, of my endeavours for the common good, is most acceptable to me. The assurances of your support will very much contribute towards bringing about the great and good ends we have in view; and you may depend upon the continuance of my best offices every where, in behalf of the Protestant cause and interest.”

Debate in the Commons on the King’s .] The Commons being returned to their House, the earl of Hertford moved for an Address of Thanks, Though this motion was carried without dividing, yet it did not pass without opposition.

Mr. Shippers in particular said, “ That no man was more ready than himself to concur in giving his majesty unfeigned assurances of the Mai and affection of that House to his person and government, iu returning him Thanks for his care and endeavours to procure the tranquillity of Europe, and in congratulating his safe return amongst us; bu he could not forbear observing that his majesty’s Speech contained many heads, of different nature, and of great importance; and as he remembered that this House had formerly been reflected on, for approving the measures of the ministry by the lump, and without knowing what those measures were, he therefore was of opinion, they ought to proceed with caution in this juncture, the -rather, because mention was made in his majesty’s Speech, of a tiling of the highest consequence, viz. the altering some part of our constitution; that it was plain enough that thereby was meant the Bill of Peerage; but it was surprising, that this affair should be brought again upon the stage, after it had miscarried the last session in the other House, and that the major part of this House had expressed such an aversion to it; concluding with a motion to congratulate his majesty upon his safe return, and to give him Thanks for part of his Speech, and appoint a day to take the rest into consideration.”

Mr. Herne hereupon seconded Mr. Sbippen; but

Mr. Hungerford foreseeing, that if the House ahould divide, <a negative was like to be put upon Mr. Shippen’s motion, said, That Addresses of this nature were but customary compliments; but he hoped that in the course of this session .they should have opportunities enough to inquire into the grievances of the nation, and the conduct of the ministry; that as to the Bill of Peerage in particular, since the court seemed to have it at heart, he doubted not but it would soon pass the other House, and

be sent down to them, and then, and no sooner; he hoped to see a great division in that House* Hereupon Mr. Sbippen waved his motion.

The Commons’ Address of Thanks and gratulation.] November 24. The Commons presented their Address to his majesty, as follows:

“ May it please your Majesty:

“We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, do return our most unfeigned thanks to your majesty for your mbs* gracious Speech from the throne, and assure your majesty, that our hearts are filled with unspeakable jpjr, upon your safe and happy return to these your kingdoms, and with the most just and grateful sense of your unwearied labours for our welfare, and the security of the Protestanc religion.

“ We heartily congratulate with your majesty on the success of your British arms, and return the thanks of this House in the most dutiful manner, for such measures taken by, the influence of British counsels, as afford the nearest prospect of a general peace abroad, and of enjoying with glory the benefit of trade and tranquillity. /

“ And we crave leave to assure your majesty, that we will, on our parts, by the'vigour of our resolutions for the support Of your government, and by the dispatch which we will give to the necessary Supplies, convince the world, that if our enemies have conceived any hopes from our divisions at home, this hath been the vainest of all their projects. And we will enable your majesty, in concert with your allies, effectually to support and perfect those just and equitable measures which have been taken to establish a general peace.

“ And we further assure your majesty, That we will apply ourselves to find out the best means for lessening the Debts of the nation, and supporting the public Credit; and will concur in all proper methods to establish and preserve the freedom of our happy constitution, for which your sacred majesty has.given so many tender proofs of your care and affection.”

The King's Answer. 1 To which Address the King returned the following Answer:

“ Gentlemen;

“ This loyal Address deserves my best thanks. It contaius the most dutiful and affectionate expressions to my person and government; and yoa shall perceive my sense of them, by the endeavours I will always use to procure'your welfare and prosperity.”

Debate in the Lords on Me Peerage Bill.*] November 25. The duke of Buckingham brought into the House of Lords the Bill of Peerage, 'which was read the first time; and

being read a second trtoe the next jay, upon a motion that the same be committed,

Earl Camper said, That besides the reasons

that induced him last session to be against this biH, he had now another that weighed no less with him than all the rest, viz. The ear* neatness with which it was recommended, and die eagerness with which it was brought before them, at the beginning of a session; that he bad observed, both from history, and his own experience, that in affairs of moment, precipitation was ever dangerous, and, in many cases, to be Suspected; and, for his own part, he could not help being of opinion, that if tjhere were no secret meaning in this bill, some men would not be so pressing for it. To this

The Earl of Sunderland answered, “ That it could not with any justice be said, that any precipitation had been used in this affair, since the bill in question had been brought in the

draw the Peerage Bill, at the moment of certain success in the House of Lords. In vain the pen of Addison had been employed in defending the Bill, in a paper called. The Old Whig, against Steele, who attacked it in a pamphlet intitled The Plebeian; and whose arguments had greater weight with the public. Walpole also published a pamphlet on the same side of the question, ‘ The Thoughts of a Mem-

* ber of the Lower House, in relation to a

* project for restraining and limiting the power

* of the Crown in the future creation of Peers/ In this publication, he explained the nature of the bill, and exposed the views of those who introduced it, with a perspicuity of argument, and simplicity of style adapted to all capacities, and calculated to make a general impression.

u The minister, however, did not relinquish his darling bill. During the interval between the prorogation and meeting of parliament, he exerted every effort to engage a majority in its favour. Bribes were profusely lavished, promises and threats were alternately employed, in every shape which his sanguine and overbearing temper could suggest. He affected to declare, that it was the king’s desire, and not the act of the ministry; he did not attempt to conceal that it was levelled against the future government of the prince of Wales, whom he represented as capable of ‘ doing

* mad things’ when he came to the throne. He declared that the necessary consequence of its rejection would be the ruin of the Whigs, and the introduction of the Tories into the confidence and favour of the king; expressed his surprise that any person who stiled Jiimself a Whig should oppose it; and'exerted himself in the business with so much heat and violence, that in endeavouring to persuade Middleton, lord chancellor of Ireland, who Infused to support the measure in the British House of Commons, the blood gushed from his nose.

“ These efforts were attended with such suc-ctUi that at a meeting held by the leaders of the

last session, and then thoroughly examined; that he doubted not but every member of that House was fully apprized of it, and ready to give his vote for or against it: that the Teason why it was brought in so soon at this time, he conceived to be, that it might give no interruption to the othefr important affairs, which the king had recommended to his parliament: and as for any secret meaning in this bill, his lordship solemnly declared, that he knew of no other, but what his majesty bad been pleased graciously to intimate in his speech, viz. the securing the freedom of our constitution, by pre* venting, for the future, the abuse of one branch of the royal prerogative, of which they bad a fatal instance in the last reign, and which had given just offence, and terrible apprehensions to all sober men.”

To this it was replied, That if it was foreseen that bill might interrupt the other im-

Whigs, in opposition, at Devonshire-House* Walpole found the whole body lukewarm, irresolute or desponding» several of the peers secretly favoured a bin which would increase their importance; others declared, that as Whigs, it would be a manifest inconsistency to object to a measure tending to prevent the repetition of an abuse of prerogative against which they had repeatedly inveighed; those who were sincerely averse to it, were unwilling to exert themselves in hopeless resistance, and it was the prevailing opinion that the bill should be permitted to pass without Opposition. Walpole alone dissented, and reprobated, in the strongest terms, ‘ this resolution as dastardly and impolitic. He maintained that it was the only point on which they could harrufis administration with any prospect of success; that he would place it in such a light as to excite indignation in every independent commoner; that he saw a spirit rising against it among the Whigs, and particularly-among the country gentlemen, who were otherwise not averse to support government. He said, that he had overheard a member of the House of Commons, a country gentleman, who possessed an estate of not more than 800/. a year, declare to another, with great warmth, that although he bad no chanoe of being made a peer hitnself, yet be would never consent to the injustice of giving a perpetual exclusion to his family. He was convinced, he added, that the same sentiment would have a strong effect upon the whole body of country gentlemen; and concluded his animated remonstrances, by declaring, that if deserted by his party, he himself would singly stand forth and oppose it. This declaration, urged with uncommon- vehemence, occasioned much altercation, and many persuasions were made to deter him from adopting a measure which appeared chimerical and absurd; but when they found that he persisted, the whole party gradually came over to his opinion, and agreed that an opposition should be made to it in this House of Commons.” Coke’s Walpole.

portant affairs, it had been adviseable to keep it unjtil the middle, or towards the end of the session, and to begin with the king’s business.” But

The Duke of- Buckingham compromised the matter, by saying, That, for his own part, he apprehended no danger from this bill, and if it was attended with any inconveniences, as all human affairs are apt to be, time, would discover it; and then, as in all other cases, they

- might apply a remedy to it. As to the time of; bringing of it in, his grace thought it no mate-

- rial objection, since this House had no other . business to go upon: but that he foresaw, that

whatsoever dispatch they made in that bill, it . would not get so quick a passage in the other, House.

The Peerage Bill passes the House of iorefe.] Hereupon the Bill was committed to a committee of the whole House, who went through it the next day; and on the 28th, the earl of Clarendon, chairman of that committee, having made his report, the same was agreed to, and the Bill ordered to be ingrossed. On the 30th of this month, the Lords read the said Bill the third time, passed the same, and ordered it to be sent down to the Commons.

Debate in the Commons oil the Peerage Bill.] December 1. Upon a message from the Lords, by the lord chief justice King, and the lord chief baron Bury, that the Lords had passed a Bill, in titled, * An Act for the Settling ' ‘ the Peerage of Great Britain:’ to which they desired the concurrence of the Commons, the said Bill was read the first time, and a motion being made, That the said bill be read a. second time the Friday next ensuing, the same was opposed by a great many members, who moved, That this important affair might be put off to the 18th of this month; which last motion, after a long and warm debate, was carried by m majority of 203 against 158.

December 18. The, engrossed Bill from the Lords, intitled, An Act for the Settling the Peerage of Great Britain, ’ was read a second time, and a motion being made by the lord William-Paulet, teller of the Exchequer and member for Winchester, for committing the Bill, which was seconded by sir Charles Ho-. tham, the same occasioned a warm debate, which lasted from one o’clock in the afternoon till near nine at night. The members who. spoke for committing the Bill, - were lord William Paulet, sir Charles Hothara, col. Moreton, Mr. Hampden, Mr. Craggs, Mr. Plummer, Mr. .Lecbmere, Mr. Aislabie, serjeant Pengelly, and Mr. Hungerford; against committing it, Sir .Richard Steele, Mr. Pitt, sir Wilfrid Lawson, Mr. Horatio Walpole, Mr. Wykes, sir John Packington, Mr. Methuen, Mr. Herne, Mr. Tuffnell, Mr. R. Walpole, and Mr. John Smith.

, Sir Bichard Steele spoke first against committing the Bill as follows:

the worst of all tyrannies, that of an aristocracy, which is the most likely consequence to attend such a law as this would be:the whole tenor of the Bill is very unfortunately put together, if any thing, but an addition of power to the peers, is intended by it.* All mankind must

* “ It so happened that (1718-19) acontro-, versy was agitated with great vehemence between those friends of long continuance, Addison and Steele. It may be asked, in the language of Homer, what power or what cause should set them .at variance. The subject of their dispute was of great importance. The earl of Sunderland proposed an act called the Peerage Bill; by which the number of peers should be fixed, and the king restrained from any new creation of nobility, unless when an old family should be extinct. To this the Lords would naturally agree; and the king, who was yet little acquainted with his own prerogative, and, as is now well known, almost indifferent to the possession of the crown, had been, persuaded to consent. The only difficulty was found among the Commons, who were not likely to approve the perpetual exclusion of themselves and their posterity. The Bill therefore was eagerly opposed, and among others by sir Robert Walpole, whose speech was published.

“ The Lords might think their dignity diminished by improper advancements, and particularly by the introduction of twelve new peers ac once, to produce a majority of Tories in the last reign:an act of authority violent enough, yet certainly legal, and by no means to be compared with thdt contempt of national fight with which, some time afterwards, by the instigation of Whiggism, the Commons, chosea by the people for three years, chose themselves for seven. But whatever might be the disposition of the Lords, the people had no wish to encrease their power. The tendency of the Bill, as Steele observed in a letter to the. earl of Oxford, was to introduce an aristocracy; for a majority in the House of Lords, so limited, would have been despotic and irresistible.

“ To prevent this subversion of the ancient establishment, Steele, whose pen readily seconded his political passions, endeavoured to alarm the nation, by a pamphlet called The Plebeian. To this an answer was published by Addison, under the title of The Old Whig, in which it is not discovered that Steele was then known to be the advocate for the Commons. Steele replied by a second Plebeian; ahd, whether by ignorance or by courtesy, confined himself to his question, without any personal notice of his opponent. Nothing hitherto was committed against the laws of friendship or proprieties of decency; but controvertists cannot long retain their kindness for each other. The Old Whig answered the Plebeian, and could not forbear some contempt of “ littlg Dicky,

“ whose trade it was to write pamphlets.” Dicky, however, did not leave his settled veneration for his friend; but contented himself

allow, that the only plausible reason for this law, was what happened in the last reign, when twelve peers were made in one day; but the Preamble assigns no such reasons, but saiys,

* That sixteen peers of Scotland, by reason of

* many new creations since the Union, are not a

* sufficient and proportionable representative *-of that nobility/ And therefore they shall hereafter not be represented at all; but, ‘A

* thing much more suitable to the peerage of

* Scotland ought to be done for them/ to wit,

* That twenty-five of them should, at all times

* hereafter, have hereditary seats in parliament'.

“ I always imagined that no man could judge what was suitable to him hut himself; and tfyat it could be no manner of comfort to one who has any thing taken from him, that the possession of it is more suitably placed in another. How is it suitable to the peerage of Scotland, that instead of having a representative of sixteen sitting by their election, they are hereafter to be favoured with having 25 there instead of them, and not one there in their behalf? It must be confessed, that the peers of Scotland cannot complain of any thing like being tricked; but their potential seats in parliament are barred and taken from them, not by. poliuston and double dealing, but by the most unreserved and candid usurpation imaginable:but though this is done with so much ease, and no reason given but that they who do it, are pleased to say it is most suitable; it is to be presumed, that those, whose consent is necessary for the divesting innocent men of their liberty and honour, will desire some better account of the matter, before they deprive their fellow-subjects of their undoubted rights. I cannot but, from a natural detestation of injustice, say, that is the highest wrong done to the indulgence mentioned in the preamble, to expect it will be granted in favour of any men in wrong of any other; and I doubt not but this House will alarm that benignity from being employed to the destruction of itself, or oppression of others.

with quoting some lines of Cato, which were at once detection and reproof. The bill was laid aside during that session; and Addison died before the next, in which its commitment was rejected by 265 against 177.

“ Every reader surely must regret that these t|ro illustrious friends, after so many years past in confidence and endearment, in unity of interest, conformity of opinion, and fellowship of study, should fioally part in acrimonious opposition. Such a controversy was ‘ Bellum

but of his too great goodness: happy the sore* reign and happy the people, wheo excessive grace is all that can be feared of him.

“ The Peers of Scotland have an indefeasible right, by the Acfof Union, to be elected and serve in parliament as peers of Great Britain, in the maimer therein stipulated, and it would be but more cruel, not more unjust, to take from them their lives and fortunes, than this honour and privilege, which their ancestors purchased by the frequent hazard of theirs: the terms of the Union are plain and absolute; nor can any privilege, liberty, or property secured by it to the meanest subject of either nation, be vio*: lared or altered against his will, and no satisfactory reparation done him, without infringement of the whole act, and leaving the persons so injured, at liberty to aveuge by force what was done by it: for protection and obedience are reciprocal, and withdrawing the one, discharges the other. v What then is the condition of these unhappy men, who are to be divested of their, rights and privileges of subjects, and yet, no doubt, to be deemed traitors, should they fly to any foreign power, -or invader of thqe nation, which has in the dearest and greatest considerations, those of honour and distinction, made them foreigners? The terms of the Union cannot be revoked without disuniting the kingdoms; for when that is done they are no longer held together by the law, but by force; ami the power which then, keeps us together matt he arbitrary, not legal; or if legal, not righteous; for a law, not supported by justice, is in itself null and void; nor are the makers of it legislators, but oppressors. It appears, without any possible contradiction, that the parliament of Great Britain cannot exclude the peers of Scotland from the benefit of the 23d Article in the Act of Union, * without becoming an at* bitrary power, acting with an indifference to good and evil, or the foundation of might only.

“ We are safer under the prerogative in the king, than we can be under an aristocracy. The prerogative is a power in the sovereign, not ex-, pressed or described in the laws, but to be exercised in the preservation of them by the rule of the general good: and if it could be proved, that, the business of the twelve gentlemen, (meaning the twelve lords created by queen, Anne in the time of the earl of Oxford’s ministry) was purely done to save the nation, and that it was done for the good of the whole, thie statesman, who advised it, would deserve the thanks of all mankind, for exposing himself to the misrepresentation and resentment of future parliaments, for the good of his fellow-subjects.

“ 1 will not pretend to doobt but those noble personages have, under the hands and seals of all and every of their electors, the peers of Scotland, full power and authority for this alteration, without which their proceeding could not be reponciled to common honour: and if the thirty odd, who are to be ennobled by this Bill, are

• See vol. 6, Appendix, p. ccxii, *

CIS]

t<» be made up by present members of th6 House of Commons, such members are to climb te honour through infamy.

“ The Bill seem9 to me to be calculated for nothing but an aristocracy, and indeed, has not so much as the appearance of any thing else; for' though a man of honour and conscious integrity knows, that he is a peer for the sake of his fellow-subjects, and that this right is vested in him and his family for the sake of society, not for himself and successors only, yet is there no part of society considered in this bill, but merely the peers and nobles. The Lords exercise a power in the last resource: and an appeal lies to them from all the courts of West-roister-lndl, for determining all the property of Great Britain, and yet they are willing to have ar law, which must necessarily disable them from being a capable court of justice for the future; for the Bill even provides for their insufficiency as to this purpose; and there is a clause, which, instead of looking out for gi*eat and knowing men, i? very careful to leave the power in the king to give titles, in case of extinctions, to minors:much of the same stamp is the partiality of the'Bill, that females are excluded from their future right; as if a lady of good sense were not as capable of bringing into the world a man of sense, as a boy, under age, is of becoming a man of justice and honour from the mere recommendation of his fortune; for it is not to he doubted hut that would be his best pretensions; but lords have thought it more eligible to have in view the providing rich husbands for their daughters from among the Commons, than the leaving it to their female heirs, to make Lords of the dependents of meritorious commoners.

- “ Thus the aristocracy is?set out by this bill; for all the provisions and limitations of it regard only the titles and honours of the peers, and prodigious care is taken, that no one should •offer from possible contingencies and distant incidents among themselves, but no regard had to the known immediate present rights of those who do not sit in their House, but have title of election into it: there is no difficulty of destroying those whom they know to have titles, but they are prodigious tender of hurting those who may have titles, of which they do not know: the lords will be judges, and give and fftlmit to whom they please incident claims; bat extinctions are to be supplied only by the king, and he might possibly give them to persons they should not like. The restraint of the peers to a certain number will make the most powerful of them have the rest under their direction; and all the property'disposed before them will be bestowed, not by judgment, hut by vote and humour, or worse. Judges so made by the blind order of birth will be capable of fio othet way of decision.

“ It is said that power attends property; hut it is as true, that power will command property; and according to the degeneracy of human nature, the Lords may as well grow corrupt another men-; and if they should do so,

[€I4

how will this be amended, but by the consent of those, who shall become so corrupt? What shall1 we say then? Shall we expose ourselves to probable evils, with the foresight of impossible remedies against them?-

“ It is hardly to be read seriously, when the Bill in a grave stile and sober Contradiction has' these words, viz. ‘ The twenty five peers ou ‘ the part of the peerage of Scotland as if they who were made instead of the peers of Scotland, could, without a banter, be called peers on the part of the peerage of Scotland; the true description of them is, peers made when the peers of Scotland were no more to be peers; for the title resting in their families, without hopes of succession in tl>e peerage and legislature, is only a bar against any participation of power and interest in their country; it is putting them into the condition of papists convict, as to what ought to be most dear to them, their honour and reputation. It is held by true politicians a most dangerous thing to give the meanest of the people just cause of provocation; much more to enrage men of spi» it and distinction, and that too with downright injuries.

“ We may flatter ourselves, that property is always the source of power; but property, * like all other possessions, has its effects according to the talents and abilities of the owner; and as it is allowed, that courage and learning are very common qualities in that nation, it seems not very advisable to provoke the greatest, and, for ought we can tell, the best men among them. Thus we are barred from making this law by prudential reasons, as well as from tha inviolable rule of justice and common rl^ht, with relation to the Scots Peers.

“If we consider the matter with regard to the king's prerogative, this law will diminish it to an irreparable degree; and it is a strange time to take away power, w heu it is in the possession of a prince, who uses it with so much^nodern-tion, that he is willing to resign it; hut we are to consider the prerogative as part of the estate of the crown, and not consent to the taking it out of the crown, till we see just occasion for it., His majesty's indulgence makes it safe in hia royal breast; .and we know of nothing, any other of the family has done, to alter it for fear of him.

“ The Prerogative can do no hurt, when ministers do their duty; but a settled number of Peers may abuse their power, when no man is answerable for them, or can call them to an account for their incroachments. It is said, and truly too, that the manner of their power will be the same as now; but then the application of it may be altered, when they are an unchangeable body: schemes of grandeur and oppression can be formed to invade the property, as well as liberty, of their fellow-subjects; which would, according to the present estab- ' lisbment, be vain to undertake, when they are subject to an alteration, before their project could he ripened into practice and usurpation.

“ As for any sudden and surprizing way of

creation. That'lies before the legislature for censure; and the great diminution which all ' creations bring upon the king’s authority, is a sufficient defence against the abusive employment of that authority this way:For when the king makes peer ^, he makes perpetual opponents of his will and power, if they shall think fit; which one consideration cannot but render frequent creations terrible to the crown. This Constitution has subsisted in spite of convulsions and factions, without restraining or repressing the exient of the legislative powers; nor is it possible for any mao, or assembly of men, to circumscribe their distinct authorities: No, they are to be left eternally at large; and the safety of each part, and the good of the whole, are to be the rules of their conduct: And as it is impossible to foresee all the circumstances which must arise before th^m, there is no safe way but leaving them at large, as vigilant checks upon each other, unconfined, but by reason and justice.

" If there was any outrage committed in the case of the. twelve gentlemen, the peers should have then withstood the receiving of them, or done what they thought fit atv another season for their satisfaction; and not, when it is too late, -instead of asserting their liberties, mediate their future security in unreasonable concessions from the crown, ' and discouragements upon the merits of the Commons: and can the gentlemen in present power reasonably think, that the consummation of the English glory and merit, is to dose and rest in their persons ?

"After the Bill has sufficiently provided for the aristocracy over these dominions, it goes ' into a kind of ceconomy and order among themselves, which relates to their nobility and not to their Peerage. We plain men and Commoners will not dispute about any thing which we know to be merely trifling and ornamental; mid if they will be satisfied with a power in them as peers, they shall be dukes, marquises, earls, or whatever other words they please, without our env^ or opposition:But when we come seriously to consider what we are going to do, we rou>t take the liberty to be very jealous, at the last time, that it may be in our power to tnakd a stand for ourselves and posterity; and noblemen cannot blame commoners, who are as shy in bestowing, as they are importunate in urging, the gran^of such a power in themselves, which can be of no use or advantage but to themselves:at the same time one cannot resist observing to them, that, with respect to the prerogative; the peerage of Scotland, and the' rights of the whole body of the people of Great Britain, they cannot be more exorbitant in the . use of ibis Bill, should it become a law, than in the circumstances under which they send it to ais for our concurrence; and it is not thirst of power, but moderation in the demands made of it, which can recommend men to farther trust; *nd I cannot but apprehend that what is founded on usurpation, will be exerted in tyranny.

" It is to be hoped, that this unreasonable Bill will be entirely rejected, since none can pretend

/

y. — ‘Debate in the HouseqfVomrhons _ [616 '

to amend what is in its very nature incorrigible; for it would be in vaiu to attempt a good superstructure, upon a foundation which deserves nothing but indignation and contempt.

" It is a melancholy consideration, that under the pressure of debts, the necessities of a wajr, the perplexities of trade, and the calamities of the poor, the legislature should thus be taken up and employed in schemes for the advancement of the power, pride, and luxury, of the rich and noble. It is true, this affair ought to be treated in a most solemn manner, by reason of the awful authority from whence it conies; but we must not, on such occasions, be oppressed by outward things, but look to the bottom of the matter before us, divested of every thing that can divert us from seeing the true reason of what passes, and the pretensions to what is asked.

"If this Bill is required for preventing the creation of occasional peers, why, at the same time, are 25 Scots, and; 8 English, to be now made? H not this the same thing, as to say, if you will let us -make so many this one time, under the sanction of a law, we will make no more, for we shall have no occasion for any more ? The latter end of this Bill seems to* have some compassion towards the prerogative, and enacts something gracious towards the’dependents of the sovereign, before the commencement of the Aristocracy, viz. Provided 1 always nevertheless. That nothing in this act

* contained, shall be taken or construed to lay ‘ any restraint upon the king’s majesty, his heirs 1 or successors, from advancing or promoting *. any peer having vote and seat in parliament,

‘ to any higher rank or degree of dignity or ‘ nobility; nor from creating or making any:

is conferred on those of it, who are not yet intitled to that honour, it is to he presumed, that nothing vested in others of them will be .assaulted; but that whatever becomes of this Bill, their present estates, their then remaining estates, will be still inviolable.

" Since there is so full a House at this debate,

I doubt not but it will infallibly end according to justice; fori can never think the libeityuf Great Britain in danger at such a meeting but for my part, I am against committing of this bill, because I think it would be committing of sin.’ ’

Mr. Pitt, member for Old Sarora, spoke next against the projectors of this Bill, whom he taxed with mean obsequiousness to foreigners, and with design^ against the liberties of their countrymen.

Sir Wilfred Lawson, and Mr. Horatio Wat-

pole, who spoke on the same side, were answered by colonel Moreton.

Sir John Packington spoke as follows:

Mr. Speaker: We have all the reason in the world to acknowledge the good intentions his majesty has been pleased to express in his Speech for the good of his subjects and the liberty of our constitution; but, in my opinion, his majesty is not rightly informed of the manner of making his subjects feel thfe effects of those gracious intentions; and in particular, the Bill now before us is a very improper return to all the demonstrations of duty, zeal, and affection, which his faithful Commons have given since his majesty’s happy accession to the throne. When the king and his ministers thought fit to enter into a strict alliance with Fraoce, and thereby give that ancient and almost irreconcilable enemy of England, an opportunity to retrieve the extreme low and desperate condition of their affairs, the Commons did not oppose those measures. When his majesty judged it necessury, either for the good ofiiis subjects, or to secure some acquisitions in Germany, to declare war against Sweden, and to send strong squadrons into the Baltic, his faithful Commons readily provided for those great expences. When afterwards it was thought proper to deprive his majesty’s subjects of the beneficial trade to Spain, by declaring war against that crown, and sending a-fleetinto the Mediterranean to serve as ferry boats for the emperor’s troops, the good oatured Commons approved those wise counsels: After all these $nd several other instances of obsequiousness and complaisance, which this House has shewn for the ministers, it is matter of wonder we should, ' at last, be no better rewarded, than by a Bill, visibly calculated to exclude the Commons from titles of honour, and to raise the dignity and power of the peers.' It seems to have been the principal desigp of the ministry, since the beginning of this reign in particular, to give one family the absolute disposal of all honours and favours. For my own part, I never desire to be a lord, but I have a son, who may one day have that ambition; and I hope to leave him a better claim to it, than a certain great man (meaning general Stanhope) had, when he was made a peer. It is, indeed, an extraordinary and unexampled condescension in his majesty, to part with so valuable a-branch of his roygl prerogative, as is the bestowing marks of honour and distinction on such as have deserved them, by their eminent virtues and services to their king and country; however, considering what equivalent is given by this bill to his majesty, no body will wonder at this concession, if it reached no farther than his majesty: but I hope this House .will never concur in depriving of so bright a jewel of the crown, the prince, who, in his proper turn, is to wear it; and who is so worthy of it'by all the royal virtues that shine in his person; and which, during his regency, h ive gained him the hearts and affections of all true Englishmen. And if some persons have, through their indis-

’ .1719. — on the Peerage Bill. - [61S

cretion, occasioned an unhappy difference, I am apprehensive, that ^if this Bill, so prejudi-ciaf to the rights of the presumptive heir, should pass into a law, it may render that division irreconcileable; end^therefore I am against the committing this Bill *

Mr. Hampden answered one of the most material objections against the Bill, viz. That it would give the peerage an aristocratical authority; and endeavoured to shew on the contrary, That the limiting the number of the peers would rather diminish than increase their power and interest, since these. were mainly owing to the constant addition of riches which the peerage receives by the ennoblingjof wealthy commoners.

Mr. Craggs spoke on the same side, and urged, That his majesty, since his accession to the throne, had had no other view than to procure the good and happiness of his subjects and to secure their rights and liberties. That having, ' in his royal wisdom considered the abuse that was made, in the last reign, of that branch of the prerogative, relating to the creating of peers, which abuse had brought the liberties of Great Britain, and of all Europe, into imminent danger; , his majesty through a condescension worthy of a prince truly magnanimous, had graciously been* pleased to consent, that such bouuds be set to, that part of the prerogative, as may prevent any exorbitant and dangerous exercise of it for the time to come: That it was only in the reigns of good princes, that legislators had opportunities to remedy and amend the defects to which all human institutions are subject; and, that, if the present occasion of rectifying that apparent flaw in our constitution were lost, it might perhaps never be retrieved.

Mr. Methuen answered Mr. Craggs, and shewed the danger of making alterations in the fundamental laws and ancient constitution; urging the comparison of a building, in which the removing one single stone from the foundation may endanger the whole edifice.

Mr. Herne spoke on the same side.

Mr. Lechtnere owned, That he did not like this bill, as it was sent down to them, yet he did not doubt but it might be made a good one, provided the Lords would give the Commons au equivalent, and suffer them to share several privileges and advantages, which their lordships enjoy. Therefore he insisted on the committing of the bill, that they might make amendments to it; and as to the ^objection, that it was dangerous to make any innovations in the constitution, he alledged several instances, particularly, the act for limiting the. Succession and the Act of Union, which, indeed had altered, but, on the other band, had rather improved and strengthened, than prejudice^ the original constitution.

Mr. Robert Walpole next rose, and spoke a#

follows:

“ Among the Romans, the* wisest people upon earth, the Temple of Fame was placed

y

61$} PAUL. HIST. 6 George I. 1719. — De&aie ip. the House of Commons .[620

behind the Temple of Virtue, to denote that there was no coming to the Temple of Fame, but through' that of Virtue. But if this Bill is passed into a law, one of the most powerful incentives to virtue would be taken away, since there would be no arriving at honour, but through, the winding-sheet of an old decrepit’ lord, or the grave of an extinct noble family; a policy very different from that glorious and enlightened nation, who made.it their pride to hold out to the world illustrious examples of merited elevation *

* Patere honoris scirent ot cuncti viara/

“ It is very far from my thoughts to depreciate the advantages, or detract from the respect due to illustrious birth; for though the philosopher why say with the poet,

* Et genus et proaros, et quae non faciraus ipsi,

* Vix ea nostra voco; *

yet the claim derived from that advantage, though fortuitous, is so generally and so justly conceded; that every endeavour to subvert the principle, would merit contempt and abhorrence. But though illustrious birth forms one undisputed title to pre-eminence, and superior consideration, yet surely it ought not* to be the only one. The origin of high titles was derived from the will of the sovereign to reward signal services, or conspicuous merit, by a recompence which, surviving to posterity, should display in all ages the virtues of the receiver, and the gratitude of the donor. Is merit then so rarely discernible, or is gratithde so small a virtue in our days, that the one must be supposed to be its own reward, and the other limited to a barren display of impotent good-will ? Had this hill originated with some noble peer of distinguished, ancestry, it would have excited less surprize; a desire to exclude others from a participation of honours, is no novelty in persons of that class: Quod ex

* aliorum mentis sibi arrogant, id mihi ex meis

* ascrihi nolunt. ’

“ But-it is matter of just surprise, that a bill of this nature should either have been projected, or at least promoted by a gentleman *, who was, not long ago, seated amongst us, and who, having got into the House of Peers, is now \ desirous to shut the door after him.

“ When great alterations in the constitution sure to be made, the experiment should be tried for a short time before the proposed chance is finally parried into execution, lest it should produce evil instead of^ood; but in this case, when the hill js once sanctioned by parliament,

. there can he no future hopes of redress, because the upper House will always oppose the repeal of an act, which has so considerably increased their power. The great unanimity with which this Bill has passed the Lords, ought to inspire some jealousy in the Commons; for it must be obvious, that whatever the Lords gain, must he acquired at the loss of

* Lord Stanhope.

the Commons, and the diminution of /the regal prerogative; and that iu all disputes between the Lords and Commons, when the House of Lords is immutable., the Commons must sooner or later, be obliged to recede.

“ The view of the ministry in framing this bill, is plainly nothing hut to secure their power in the House of Lords. The principal argument on which the necessity of it is founded, is drawn from the mischief occasioned by the creation of twelve peers, during the reign of queen Anne, for the purpose of carrying an infamous Peace through the House of Lords; that was only a temporary measure, whereas, the mischief to be occasioned by this bill, will be perpetual. It creates 31 peers by authority of parliament; so extraordinary a step cannot be supposed to be taken without some sinister design in future. The ministry want no additional strength in the House of Lords, for couducting the common affairs of government, as is sufficiently proved by tire unanimity with which they have carried through this bill. If, therefore, they think it necessary to acquire additional strength, it must be done with views and intentions more extravagant and hostile to the constitution, than any which have yet been attempted. The bill itself is of a most insidious and artful nature. The immediate creation of nine Scotch peers, and the reservation of six English peers for a necessary occasion, is of double use; to be ready for the House of Lords if wanted, and to engage three times the number in the House of Commons by hopes and promises.

“ To sanction this attempt, the king is induced to affect to wave some part of his prerogative; but this is merely an ostensible re* nunciation, unfounded in fact, or reason. I am desirous to treat of all points relating to the private affairs of his majesty, with the utmost tenderness and caution, but I should wish to ask the House, and I think I can anticipate the answer; has any such question been upon the tapis, as no man would forgive the authors, that should put them under the neces-. sity of voting against either side ?* Are there any misfortunes, which every honest man se» cretly laments and bewails, an<J would think the last of mischiefs, should they ever become tho* subject of public and parliamentary converse tions ? Cannot numbers that hear me testify, from the solicitations and whispers they have met with, that there are men ready and determined to attempt these things if they had a prospect of success ? If they have thought, hut I hope they are mistaken in their opinion of the House, that the chief obstacle* would arise in the House of Lords, where they have always been tender upon personal points, especially to any of their own body, does not this project enable them to-carry any question through the House of Lords ? Must not the twenty-five Soots Peers accept,

--------^ — — > — — i

upon any terms, or be for ever excluded ? Or will not twenty-five be found ip all Scotland, that will ? How great will the temptation be likewise to six English, to fill the present vacancies ? And shall we then1, with our eyes open, take this step, which I cannot but look upon as the beginning of woe and confusion; and shall we, under‘these apprehensions, break through the Union, and shut up the door of honour? It certainly will have that effect; Bay, the very argument advanced in its support, that it will add weight to the Commons, by keeping the rich men there, admits that it will be an exclusion.

“ But we are told, that his majesty has voluntarily consented to this limitation of his prerogative. It may be true; but may not the king have been deceived ? Which if it is ever to be supposed, must be admitted in this case. It is incontrovertible, that kings have been overruled by the importunity of their ministers to remove, or to take into administration, persons who are disagreeable to them. The character of the king furnishes us also a strong proof that he has been deceived; for although it is a fact, that in Hanover, where he possesses absolute power, he never tyrannised over his subjects, or despotically exercised his authority, yet, can one instance be produced when heever gave up a prerogative ?

* If the constitution is to be amended in the House of Lords, the greatest abuses ought to be first corrected. But what is the abuse, against which this bill so vehemently inveighs, and which it is intended to correct ? The abuse of the prerogative in creating an occasional number of peers, is a prejudice oply to the Lords, it can rarely be a prejudice to the Com-- toons, but roust generally be exercised in their favour; and should it be argued, that in case of a difference between the two Houses, the king may exercise that branch of his prerogative, with a view to force the Commons to recede, we may‘reply, that upon a difference with the Commons, the king possesses his negative, and the exercise of that negative would be less culpable than making peers to screen himself.

“ But the strongest argument against the bill is, that it will nbt orily be a discouragement to virtue and merit, but would endanger our 'excellent constitution; for as there is a due balance between the three branches of the legislature, it will destroy that balance, and consequently subvert the whole constitution, by causing one of the three powers, which are now dependant on each other, to preponderate in the scale. The Crown is dependent upon the Commons by the power of granting money; the Commons are dependent on the Crown by . the power of dissolution:the Lords will now bemade independent of both.

“The sixteen elective Scotch peers already admit themselves to be -a dead court weight, yet the same sixteen are now to be made hereditary, and nine added to their number. These twenty-five, under the influence of corrupt 0 . i

ministers, may find their account in betraving their trust; tqe majority of the >Lords may also find their account in supporting such ministers; but the Commons, and the Common* only, must suffer for all, and be deprived Of every advantage. If the proposed measure destroys two negatives in the crown, it gives -m. negative to these twenty-five united, and confers a power, superior to that of the king himself, on the head of a clan, who will have the power of recommending many. The Scotch commoners can have no other view io supporting this measure, but the expected aggrandiae* ment of their own chiefs. It will dissolve the allegiance of the Scotch peers who are not amongst the twenty-five, and who can never hope for the benefit of an election to be peei* of parliament, and almost enact obedience from the sovereign to the betrayers of the constitution.

“ The present view of the Bill is dangerous the view to posterity, personal and unpardonable; it will make the Lords masters of the king, according to their own confession, when they admit, that a change of administration renders a new creation of peers necessary; for by precluding the king from making peers in future, it at the same time precludes him from changing the present administration, who will naturally fill the vacancies with their own creatures; and the new peers will adhere to thfe first minister, with the same zeal and unanimity as those created by Oxford adhered to him.

" If when the parliament was made septennial, the power of dissolving it.before the end of seven years had been wrested from the crown, would not such an alteration have added immense authority to the Commons ? And yet, the prerogative of the crown in dissolving parliaments, may be, and has been oftener abused, than the power of creating peers.

“ But it may be observed, that the king, -for his own sake, will rarely make a great number of peers, for they, being usually created by the influence of the first minister, soon become, upon a change of administration, a weight against the crown; and had queen Anne lived, the truth of this'observation would have been verified in the case of most of the twelve peer* made by Oxford. Let me ask, however, is the abuse of any prerogative a sufficient reason for totally annihilating that prerogative? Under that consideration, the power of dissolving par-liameots ought to betaken away, because that power has been more exercised, and more abused than any of the other prerogatives; yet in 1641, when the king had assented to a law that disabled him from proroguing or dissolving parliament, without the consent of both Houses, he was from that time under subjection to fh* parliament, and from thence followed all the subsequent mischiefs, and his own destruction, Ic may also be asked, Whether the prerogative of making peace and war has never been abused ? I might here call to your recollection the Peace of Utrecht, and the present war with i r

: 623] PARL. HIST. <5 George L 1719. — The Peerage rejected the Commons. [024

Spain. Yet who will presume to advise that the power of making war and peace, should be taken from the crown ?

“ How can the Lords expect the Commons to give their concurrence to a bill by which they and their posterity are to be tor ever excluded from the peerage? How would they, theunselves'receive a bill which should prevent a baron from being made a viscount, a viscount an earl, an earl a marquis, and a marquis a duke? Would they consent to limit the number of auy jrank of peerage ? Certainly none; unless, perhaps, tire dukes. If the pretence for this measure is, that it will tend to secure the freedom of parliament, I say that there are many other steps more important and less equivocal, such as the discontinuance of bribes and pensions.

“ That this bill will secure the liberty of parliament, I totally deny; it will secure a great preponderance to the peers; it will form them into a compact impenetrable phalanx, by giving them the power to exclude, in all cases of ' extinction and creation, all such persons from their body, who may be obnoxious to them. In the instances we have seen of their judgment in some late cases, sufficient marks of partiality may be found to put us on our guard against the committing to them the power they would derive from this hill, of judging the right of latent or dormant titles, when their verdict would be of such immense importance. If gentlemen will not be convinced by argument, at least, let them not shut their ears to the dreadful example of former times; let them recollect that the overweening disposition of the great barons, to aggrandize their own dignity, occasioned them to exclude the lesser barons, and to that circumstance may be fairly attributed the sanguinary wars which so long desolated the country.”* I

“ Mr. Walpole’s performance in this debate,

I have heard, for L was not then come into parliament, was very great, and had as much of natural eloquence and of genius in it as had b6en beard by any of the audience within those walls. His topics were popular, and made for those he hoped to bring over. He talked of the honours of peerage as the constitutional reward of great qualities and actions only, in the service of the commonwealth, and to he kept open for that purpose. That the usual path to the temple of honour had been through the temple of virtue; hut by this bill it was now to be only through the sepulchre of a dead an-cessor, without merit or fame. In this strain he bore down every thing before. him, even against very able performances, by many very considerable persons who spoke on the other side of the question." Speaker Onslow’s Re-

Mr; Aislabie, Chancellor of the Exchequer,

stood up next, and answered a material ob~ jection that had beeh raised against the bill, viz.< That it was dangerous to uaake any in- novations in the constitution; ’ and made it appear, that several alterations had been o>ade in the original constitution by Magna Charta, the Habeas Corpus Act, and several other laws made for the benefit of the subject; and upon the whole was for committing the hill. He was backed by serjeant Peugelly, but they were opposed by v

Mr. Smith, who urged, That the foundation of this bill being wrong and faulty, there was no room for amendments, and therefore he was against committing it.

Mr . Hungerford, who brought up the rear, was for committing the hill.

The Peerage Bill rejected by the Commons.] At about a quarter past eight in the evening, the question being put upon lord William PaU-let’s motion, the same was carried in the negative, by a majority of 269 voices against 177, so that including the two ^tellers on each side, there were 450 members in the House. After this the prevailing party, to signalize'their victory, moved, and it was resolved without a division, “ That the Bill he rejected."

First Proposal of mat Sovth 8s* Cose *

PANY* FOR REDUCING THE PUBLIC DEBTS.] Jan. 22, 1720. The Commons, in a grand committee, took into consideration that part of bit majesty's Speech at the opening of this session, which relates to the Public Debts, and read rite

* “ The South Sea Company owed its origin to a chimerical project, formed by Harley in 1711, for the purpose of restoring public ere* dit, which had beeu greatly affected by thedis* mission of the Whig ministry, and of establish* ing a fund for the discharge of the navy and army debentures, and the other parts of tho floating debt, which amounted to 9, 471, 325/, ] and was afterwards increased to 10,000,000/# With a view to settle a fund for paying the in* terest of 6 per cent, on these arrears, which amounted to the annual sum of 568, 979/, all the duties upon wines, vinegar, tobacco, India goods, wrought silks, whale fins, and a few other duties, were rendered permanent. Ini order to allure the creditors with the hopes of advantages from a new commerce, the monopoly of a trade to the South Sea, or coast of Spanish America, was granted to a .company composed of the proprietors of this fundedf debt, which being incorporated by act of par* liament, took the appellation of the South Sea Company. The great advantages to be derived from this commerce, had been exaggerated from the time of our first voyages to Spanish. America, in the reign of Elizabeth, and still farther increased by the reports of the buccaneers. The considerable riches which France bad brought from America, since the establish* ment of Philip the Fifth on the throne of Spain, had contributed to raise the sanguine expectations, of the British merchants: a ruwQur, industriously circulated, that four ports on the cqast of Peru and. Chili, were to be ceded by Spain, inflamed the general ardour; the prospect of exchanging gold, silver, and rich drugs for the manufactures of England, were plausible allurements for an enterprising and commercial nation; and the mines of Potosi and Mexico, were to diffuse their inexhaustible, stores through the medium of the new company.:-

“ The famous act of parliament, which incorporated the subscribers of the debts, under the name of the governor and company of merchants of Great Britain trading to the South. Seasand other parts of America, was. called the earl of Oxford's master piece, and considered, by his panegyrists as the sure means of firing* ing an inexhaustible mine of riches into England.. But in fact this scheme was settled on a false foundation; for by the peace a£ Utrecht, Spain and the Indies being conformed to Philip the Fifth, that monarch was too jew lous to admit the English to.a free trade in the. South Sea, and instead of the advantageous commerce which Oxford had held forth, the company obtained only the Ass Lee to contract, ' or the privilege of supplying the Spanish colonies of negroes fox 30 years* wi#

Acoobne of those Debts, osthey stood at the 1U chequer, at Michaelmas, 1719; as also a Proposal of the South Sea Company* towards the Redemption and Sinking of the said debts:which Proposal is as follows;

To tbt honourable the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament assembled.

The Corporation of the governor and Company of1 merchants of Great Britain, trading to' the South Sea and other parts of America, ferftd for encouraging the fishery, having under their consideration how they may be most serviceable to his majesty and his government; and to shew their zeal and readiness to concur

v the permission of sending to Spanish America On annual Ship, limited both as to tonnage and value of cargo, of the'profits of which the king of Spain reserved one fourth, and 5 per cent, on the other fourths. This disappointment was attempted to be counteracted by the declaration made by Oxford, that Spain had permitted two ships, in addition to the annual ship, to carry merchandize, during the first year to the northern coasts of Spanish America, and a pbmpons nomination of the several ports where the company had leave to trade, ana settle factories. But the grand benefits of this commerce were never realised. The first voyage of the afonuarship was not made till 1717, and in the following year, the trade was suppressed by the rupture with Spain. Their effects, factories, and servants were seized and detained, notwith* standing the agreement in the Assiento, which allowed, in case of a rupture, 18 months for the removal of their effects.

* “ such was the state of the South Sea Company; when the ministry, instead of attempting to lessen the national incumbrances, by‘the only just and successful means, a Clear and in-. viokble sinking fond, adopted the visionary schemes of projectors, and gave to - the Company the power of fascinating the minds of the public, and spreading an infatuation similar to that which had recently involved France in a national bankruptcy. The grand point which government had in view, was the reduction of the irredeemable annuities, created in the feigns of William and Anne, for a period of 89/ 98, and 99 years, amounted nearly to 800,0001; per annum, ' as na effectual'measures could be adopted to lessen the public debts, whilst these annuities remained irredeemable.

“ In order to effect this liquidation, the minister accepted proposals from the South Sea Company, for reducing the debts to a redeemable state: as the Object of the ministers, who h'ad previously and secretly arranged the scheme Withthe directors, was to surprise the House of Commons into the measure of granting this ei-fonske privilege tar the South Sea Company, and of preventing competition, they entertained the most sanguine hopes of success, ifronf the specious advantages, "Which they~held forth to the public, of the necessary conscience*^ Coxe's Walpole,

in the great and honourable design of reducing the NatitrfiabDebt*. in such manner at may ha consistent with, and for the support of parliamentary credit, do humbly apprehend. That if the Public Debts and Annuities mentioned in the anneied Estimate were taken into, and made part of the capital stock of the said Com* pany, it would greatly contribute to that most desirable end; which debts and annuities may be comprehended under the general heads following, viz.

Therefore they do humbly propose. That the said company may be permitted to iniarge their present capital, by taking in the said annuities, and debts at any time or times until Lady-day 1721, on the terms and conditions following; viz.

1. That the said annuities be taken into' the said company, either by purchase, or voluntary subscription of the proprietors thereof, and without any compulsion on them, at such price and prices as shall be agreed 'between the company, and the proprietors of those annuities.

Si. That for the annuities for 99 years, or 96 years, for every five pounds per annum taken into the company, there be 5/. per annum added to the company’s present annuity, and 100/. to their capital stock, being after the rate of*20 years purchase.

3. That the residue of lottery 1710 be estimated1 at 14 years purchase, for the 23 years due on them from Michaelmas 1719; and tlias the annuities of 9 per cent, per annum be also estimated at 14 years purchase, for the 224 years due on them from Christmas 1719; and there be an addition to the stock and annuity

4. That She said redeemable debts be likewise taken into the said company, either by purchase, subscription, or paying them off by the asid company.

5. That, for all the said redeemable debts,

there be added 100/. to the capital stock of the said company, for every 100/. so taken in by them:and the like annuity added to the company’s present annuity as is now payable for the interest of those debts.

6. That the company be allowed, for charges of management for their thus to be increased capital, so much as it now costs the government Ibr the charges of paying, assigning, and accounting for . the said debts; or such a proportion thereof as the sum which shall be taken in by the company shall bear to the whole of those debts.

7. That the present annuities for the company’s present capital, and the annuities ibr the thus to be increased capital, be continued, at the rates aforesaid, (ill Midsummer 1737; and that, from and after that time, their theo annuity for their whole capital stock shall be actually reduced to per cent, per annum, and likewise be thenceforth redeemable by parliament.

8. That the company’s present and to be increased allowance, for charges of management, do continue till their capital be redeemed, as their present allowances for management are.

9., That the annuities to the company, for their thus to be increased capital, be paid them' weekly, as their present annuities are; and be'charged on the funds now appropriated to the said debts and annuities so taken into the company.

10. That for the liberty of increasing their, capital stock, as aforesaid, the , company will give and pay into his majesty’s exchequer, for. the service of the public, and to be applied fort paying off the public debts provided for by parliament before Christmas 1716, the sum three millions and an half, by four equal quarterly payments, whereof the first payment to be at Lady-Day 1731.

11. That though the company’s capital is proposed nqt to be redeemable until Midsummer 1737, yet they do submit, that so much as shall, arise by the sinking funds before that time, may (from and after paying off such part of the public debts as may be redeemed within that time, -and Which shall not be taken into the said company) be applied at the end of every year, ; towards paying off, in even hundred thousand, pounds, that part ol ttye company’s capital which carries5/. per cent, pet annum.

13. The said company do farther submit, . that for such of the present exchequer-bills, a* the parliament shall continue, and for such new ones as they shall impower the lords of the treasury to issue and circulate (without the subscription or contract of any persons or corporation) the company will be obliged (from and after Midsummer 1730, until the reduction of the annuities for their whole capital, to per cent, per ann. aqd no longer) to pay such proportion of money and interest as shall be found. necessary by the lords of the treasury, or trustees to be appointed by them, SO circulate the: same, as the sum of one million shall bear to. the total amount of such exchequer-bilb:the. company having the like proportion of the benefit of the interest which shall be saved on such bills, during the time they shall be in the hands of any public officer, or in the exchequer.

This Proposal coming short of what was Expected, and the friends of the Bank of England having represented, in behalf of this last corporation, the great and eminent services they had done to the government, in the most difficult times, and which deserved, at least, That if Any advantage was to be made by any public bargains, they should be preferred before company that bad never done any thing for the nation, the farther consideration of that important affair was put off, till the 27th.

• First Proposal of the Bane, op England for reducing the Public Debts.] Jan. 27. The Commons, in a grand committee, considered farther of the Pqblic Debts; and the Bank of England having laid their Proposition before (he Committee, whereby it appeared, that they offered about two millions sterling more to the government, in less time than the South-Sea Company had done; it was thought fit to give the said Company some time to consider farther'on that matter; which was thereupon put off 'till the 1st of February. The said Proposal of theBank of England is as follow*:

To the Honourable the Commons of Great*" Britain in Parliament assembled. — The humble Proposal of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England.

1. That in case they may have a power granted to them by parliament to purchase or take in, by way of subscription, the several Exchequer-annuities, of 99 and 96 years, commonly called the Long Annuities; and amount* ing together to the sum of 667,000 per annum or thereabouts, from the several proprietors of. the said annuities, in such manner as the said proprietors shall voluntarily agree, and at any lime before the 24th day of Jdne 1721.

And also, that they may have added to tha present capititl stock of the said governor and company, such a principal sum as all the said, annuities do amount to, being computed at the rate of twenty year's purchase, which will ba 13, 354,000l. or thereabouts.

And that the several funds granted for payment of tha said annuities, may be charged >

’ with the payment, of an interest at the rate of.

The Commons, in a committee of the whole House, took into consideration that part of the king’s Speech which relates to the Public Debts; as also the second Proposals, both of the South-Sea Company, and of the Bank of England, which are as follows:

To the honourable the Commons of Great-Britain in Parliament assembled.

The corporation of the governors and company of merchants trading to the South-Seas, and other parts of America, and for encouraging the fishery, haring, on the^Tth of January last, presented their humble Proposal to this honourable House, for enlarging the capital stock of the said company, by taking thereinto the several annuities and public debts therein mentioned, on the terms and conditions in the said Proposal also mentioned; in which Proposal such advantages were offered to the public, as the said corporation did humbly hope would have been to the intire satisfaction of this honourable House, and most conducive to the certain discharging and paying off the whole debt of the nation, and to which Proposal they humbly crave leave to refer. But the governors and company of the Bank of England, having the same day also delivered a Proposal to this honourable House, for enlarging their capital Stock, by taking-in the same annuities and debts, on she terms mid conditions ia their Preposal also meutioned.

This corporation therefore, farther to manifest-! heir zeal and earnest desire to contribute their utmost to the reducing and paying off the public debts, crave leave to offer the following explanations and amendments to their said Proposal

1. Aa to the 6th article of their said former Proposal, wherein they harve'hambly desired to he allowed for charges of management, for their to be increased capital, so much as it now costs the government for charges of paying, assigning, and accompting for the said debts, or such proportion thereof, as thesurawhich shall be taken in by the company shall bear to the whole of feseifch *

They now offer, by way of explanation of that article, that’the allowances therein tnenv tinned, are not to exceed proportion to tha allowance they have now, by act of parliament, on their present capital for that purpose.

2. That whereas in the 7th article of their said Proposal it is mentioned, that the annuities for the company^ present and to be increased capital, be continued at Jthe rates therein mentioned till Midsummer 1727. And that from and after that time their then annuity on their whole capital shall be actually reduced to 4/. per cent, per annum, and likewise be from thenceforth redeemable by parliament

They do humbly offer, that if this honourable House do think is more for the interest of the public, that in lieu of the said 7th article, all the sums to be taken into the company’s capital, in pursuance of their Proposal, shall be rev deemable by parliament, from and after Mirk-summer 1724, in sums not less than 500,0007. at a time, they do consent thereto.

3. And whereas by the 10th article of their said former Proposal, they offered, for the Ik berty of increasing their capital stock, as is therein aforesaid, that they would give and pay into his majesty’s exchequer, for the service of the public, the sum of 3, '500,000

They now humbly offer, that over and abeve the mid 3, 500,000l. they will farther give and pay into his majesty’s exchequer, for the use of the public, by four equal quarterly pay* ments, on the day9 mentioned in their mid former proposal, 500,000l. more, certain, and also upon all the said annuities for certain terms oT years, which this company shall take into their capital stock, before the 1st of March, 1721, after the rate of four years and half purchase, by four quarterly payments, which if all the said, annuities be taken info the said company, will amount to the sum of 3, 567, 5Q3/. or thereabouts; to which being added the said 3, 500,000l. and the said farther sum of 500,000l. will amount in the whole to the sam of 7, 567, 500/. or thereabouts.

4. That whereas in the 11th article of their former proposal, they did submit^ that~so much as shall arise by the Sinking Fund before 'Midsummer, 1727, may, from and after paying off such part of tie public debts, asi may be redeemed within that time, and which shall not be taken in this company, be applied at the end of every year towards paying off, in evear 100,000/, that part of the company’s capital which curries 5/. per cent, per annum..

They do humbly offer, in lieu therereof, that if this honourable Houm think fit to make their to be increased capital redeemable at Midsummer, 1724, that the said Sinking Font! may, untH that time, be applied, half yearly, to the paying off that part of the company’s* capital, which is to carry 5/. per cent pW annum.

This company do farther humbly offer to give and pay ioto his majesty’s exchequer, for the service of the public, by four equal quarterly payments, one year’s purchase upon all such of those annuities as shall happen «ot to come into the said company’s capital, within the time aforesaid.

And whereas this company, is very sensible, that the prosperity of the nation doth greatly depend upon the discharging the public debts, a motive, which induced them to make the first propositions of this public and beneficial nature, they do humblysubmit these explanations and amendments to this honourable House, flattering themselves, that thqt readiness and cheer* fulness that engaged them so much earlier than any other society, to endeavour to reduce that great debt, unaer which this nation is oppressed, will intitle them to the favour and preference of this House, since they are willing, and do hereby declare, they are ready to undertake this great work upon whatever terms may be offered by any other company.

The Second Proposal op tSe Bank of England, FOR REDUCING THE PUBLIC DEBTS.] The second Proposal of the Bank of England is as follows: ...

The Governor and Company of the Bank of England do humbly offeri the following Explanation of the Proposal they delivered to this honourable Committee, the 27th of January last.

1. Whereas in the 3rd proposition it was computed, that the redeemable debts at 5/. and 4/. per cent per annum, would amount to 15, 900,000l. or thereabouts, for which they offered 20/. per cent.

. They novT find that several of the said debts do arise to a very considerable sum more than was calculated, and will consequently increase the total sum of this offer.

As for instance, If the said debts do amount to 600,000l. more, in such case, the total of their Offer will be 3, 300,000l. upon that head.

^ 2. Whereas they say, in their 5th proposition, that all the several sums that shall accrue by their proposal to the use of the public, may be applied to the discharge of that part of the fond of the Bank, that stands now redeemable at one year’s notice, their meaning is, that what shall remain over and above sufficient for the discharge of that fund, may be applied to the discharge of any of the funds of 5/. per annum to be purchased by virtue of this proposal,

' 3. In the 11th proposition, where they mention the long annuities, they mean as well those for 33 years as the longer terms.

4. And whereas in the 1st and 2nd propositions, it is implied, that the three years purchase offered to the public, is not to be paid on such of the annnuities as shall not be taken in or agreed for, the said governor and company beg leave to observe to this honourable committee, that they have good reason to believe they shall be able to accomplish this undertaking.

However, that no doubt may remain of their sincere intentions, they are content to b« obliged to offer to the several proprietors of the annuities to 96 and 99 years, 1, 700/. bank stock, far every 100/. per annum, who shall voluntarily agree for the same, on or before the 25th of June, 1720, and the like proportion for the remainder of the shorter terms.

And whereas in the 4th proposition, the •aid governor and Company do offer to have the several funds to be now purchased, redeemable on the 24th of June, 1734, they do submit to the honourable committee this alternative, that the said funds be actually reduced to 4/. per cent. Girthe 24th* of June 1727, and to be thenceforth redeemable by Parliament.

By order of the genera) court of the governor and company of the Bank of England.

Feb. 1, 1719. David le Gaos, Secretary.

The Commons resolve to accept the of the South Sea Company.] These two different Schemes occasioned a debate, in which Mr. Robert Walpole was the chief person who stood up for the Bank; but Mr. Aislaby, chancellor of the Exchequer, made it appear that the Proposals of the South Sea Company were more advantageous to the public; and it was at last resolved, “ That the Proposals made by the South SOa Company be accepted.

A Bill for securing the Dependency of -land.*] Feb. 22. A Bill intituled, ‘ An Act for the better securing the Dependency of

* During this session, a Bill, for better securing the dependency of Ireland upon the crown of Great Britain, passed both Houses. This bill took its rise, from an appeal to the House of Peers in England, by Maurice An-nesley, against a decree of the House of Peers, in Ireland:which the British House of Peers received, and ordered the barons of the exchequer in Ireland to cause Mr. Annesley to be forthwith put in possession of certain lands in the county of Kildare, of which be had been dispossessed by virtue of a decree of the House of Peers in Ireland. Pursuant to this order, the barons of the exchequer in tha, t kingdom, issued out an injunction to Alexander Burrows, sheriff of the county of Kildare, and. set several fines upon him, for refusing to put if in execution; which the House of Peers in Ireland discharged, and voted, that Jeffery, Gilbert, lord chief baron, of the exchequer, John Pocklington, and sir John St. Leger, the other barons, of the exchequer in Ireland, had acted in manifest derogation to the king’s prerogative, in his high .court of parliament ih Ireland, as also of the rights and privileges of this kingdom, and of the parliament thereof.' These barons were also ordered- to be taken into custody of the usher of the black rod.

* The House of Peers in Ireland drew up a ‘ long representation to be transmitted to tins king, setting forth their right to tbq fibal judicature of causes in that kingdom; and the duke of Leeds, in a protest against a vote passed in the House of Peers in England, gave fifteen reasons to support the claim of the House of Peers in Ireland. But the House of Lords in England resolved* That the barons of the'exchequer in Ireland had acted with courage according to law, in support of his majesty’s prerogative, and with fidelity to the crown of Great Britain and ordered an Address to the king, f for confertiri| on them some marks of his royal favour as may be a recoin pence for the ill usage they have received, by being unjustly censured, and illegally imprisoned for doing their duty.’ Then it was that the Bill for securing the Dependency of Ireland was brought in.” / Tindal,

* Great Britain ; f was read a third time in the House of Lords, passed and carried down to the Commons.

March 4. The said Bill was read a second time:and a motion being made for committing it to a committee of the whole House, it occasioned a debate. Mr. Pi tt first spoke against the Bill, saying, It seemed calculated for no other purpose than to increase the power of the British House of Peers, which in his opinion, was already but too great. He was seconded by Mr. Walter Plummer, who excepted against the preamble of the bill, as incoherent with the enacting part, which was partly owned by sir Joseph Jekyll, who, in the main, spoke for the bill. Mr. Hungerford, on the contrary side, endeavoured to shqw, that Ireland was ever independent, with respect to courts of judicature: And, he was supported by the

lord Molesworth, the lord Tyrcdnnel, and some other members: But Mr. Philip Yorke, having backed sir Joseph Jekyll: and the question being put upon the motion, it was carried in the affirmative, by 140 against 83, and so the bill was committed to a committee of the whole House; and was passed on the 26th. *

* “ 'About this time a misunderstanding happened between Mr. Lechmere, attorney-general, and sir William Thompson, solicitor-general, which was carried so far in a grand committee of the Commons, the 16th of March, thaLsir William charged Mr. Lechmere with breach of his oath, trust, and duty, as a privy-counsellor; urging, that he acted as counsel; and received sums of money for his advice, in matters to him referred by the privy couoci ), as attorney general/ After this, he proceeded to the reading of several reports, made either by the attorney general or himself, but was interrupted by Mr. Craggs, who said, They were not there to examine, who was the best lawyer; but that, a heavy accusation having been raised against a gentleman of distinguished merit, and in very eminent stations, it was incumbent upon the accuser to produce clear evidence to make good his charge.' Upon this, Mr. Lechmere stood up in his own defence, and said, he had the honour to be a privy counsellor chancellor of the duchy, attorney general, a member of that House, and a gentleman; and therefore such a heinous accusation could not but fall the heavier upon him: That he owned himself liable to a great many human frailties and imperfections; but as his conscience intirely acquitted him of the crimes laid to his charge, so he defied all the world, and the worst of his enemies, to prove him guilty of corruption or unwarrantable practices: That though htV was thus wrongfully accused in so solemn a m anner, yet, as a good Christian, he did heartily t'orgive his accuser* and was willing to believe, th; 't he was prompted to this rash action* rather l/*y mistake, or ignorance, than by malice; <x'»duffing> with desiring that honourable assembly to sift and weigh the

Debate on a Clause to be added to the Sotdk Sea Bill.] March 23. Upon the reading of the order of the day, for the House to resolve itself into a grand committee, upon the Bill for enabling the South Sea Company to in-‘ crease their Capital Stock, &c/ It was ordered. That the accounts relating to Annuities, Lotteries, and Army Debentures, be referred to the said Committee. After this a motion wat made, “ That for rendering effectual and certain to the public, the undertaking of the South Sea Company to take the annuities lor certain, terms of years, it be an instruction to the said committee, That they should have power to receive Proposals from the South Sea Company, whereby it might be fixed and determined what share or shares of and in the to be increased ‘ capital stock of the said company, the proprietors of the said annuities should be entitled to have and enjoy, who should voluntarily subscribe the samy into the said stock, or how many years purchase in money they should have and receive upon subscribing, at the choice of the proprietors; and that the committee should have power to receive ft clause or clauses accordingly/’ This motion occasioned a very warm debate, that lasted from one of the clock in the afternoon, till near seven in the evening, in which Robert* and Horatio Wtl-

whole matter with their usual candour, impartiality, and equity, and to excuse any unguarded expressions, that might escape him, in vindicating his innocence/ After this, several witnesses were stoorn, and eight or nine of them examined; but, their depositions amounting to no more than that Mr. Lechmere had taken nothing but his usual fees, as chambet>counsellor, the accusation laid against him appeared groundless to the committee, and was declared by the House to be malicious, false* and scandalous." Tindal.

* “ The Bill was warmly opposed by Walpole, who spoke in favour of the Bank, la vain he displayed the fallacy of the South Sea Scheme, and the great difference between that and the Bank, by shewing, that the company was not limited in the price they were to put on the Stock made over to them; whereas the Bank oifered a specific sum of 1, 700/. stock, for every hundred pounds in the long annuities^ and the same proportion for the wort annuities. In vain he urged, that it couatenanced the pernicious practice of stock jobbing, by diverting the genius of the nation from trade and industry; that it held out a dangerous lure for decoying the unwary to their ruin by a false prospect of gain, and to part with the gradual profits of their labour, for imaginary wealth. In vain he insisted, that if the Proposal of the South Sea Company should be accepted, the rise of their stock ought to be limited. In vftin he dwelt on the miseries and confusion which then prevailed in France, from the adoption of similar measures. In vain he urged, that an the whole success of the schema must chiefly depend on the rise of the stock, (he great ptifr>

pole, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Gould, air Richard Steele, and some other members, spoke in favour of the annuitants, who lent out their mo-

. ney, for the support of the -government, with hazard and uncertainty; and having made a contract with the legislature, and purchased yearly rents for valuable considerations, ought not to be left at the mercy of a private company. It was alledged, on the other side, by

__ Mr. Thomas Pelham, Mr. Yonge, sir Joseph

* Jekyll, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, and some other gentlemen, That the obliging the South $ea Company to fix a price upon the annuities, might endanger the success of so beneficial an undertaking: that as it was the interest of the company to take in the said an-

• nuities, so no doubt was to be made, but they would use all :beir endeavours for that purpose; and would offer such advantageous conditions to the annuitants, as would encourage them to come in voluntarily: that therefore they ought to allow the said company a competent time to try what they could do; and if id a subsequent session of parliament it should appear, that the conditions they had offered to the annuitants were not reasonable, and consequently had proved ineffectual, the Commons, in such a case, might give what direction they should think proper about that matter. These, and other reasons that were urged on the same side, had so much weight, that the question being put upon the motion beforementioned, it passed in the negative, by a majority of 144 voices against 140. Then the House having; resolved itself into a grand committee, made eome progress in the bill *

ciple of the project was an evil of the first magnitude; it was to raise artificially the value of the stock, by exciting and keeping up a general infatuation, and by promising dividends out of funds which would not be adequate to the purpose. In vain he predicted, that if the estab-

_ lishmeot succeeded, the directors would be-eome masters of the government, furm an absolute aristocracy in the kingdom, and coutroul the resolutions of the legislature; . or if it did .not succeed, the failure would cause a general discontent. He closed his speech by observing, that such would be the delusive consequences, that the public would conceive it a dream. His arguments and his eloquence were oino avail. He was compared by his friends to Cassandra, predicting evils which would Only be believed when the event proved their reality, and only deprecated when they were felt; and he whose speeches, in patters of Jinance, occupied the House with more' than jlisaal attention, was now scarcely heard. The preference was given to the South Sea, and the biU was afterwards carried by a majority of more than 3 so 1.” Coxa’s Walpole.

The Lord North and Qrey spoke first against the Bill, and said, That in his’ judgment, it was unjust in its nature, and might prove fatal in its consequences; since it seemed calculated for the enriching of a few, and the impoverishing of a great many, and not only made way for, but countenanced and authorised the fraudulent and pernicious practice of Stock-jobbing, which'produced an irreparable mischief, by diverting the genius of the people from trade and industry. His lordship was backed by

The Duke of Wharton, who endeavoured chiefly to evince. That the South-Sea project might prove of infinite disadvantage to the nation; first, as it gave foreigners an opportunity to double and treble the vast sums they had in our public funds, which could not but tempt them to withdraw their capital stock, with their immense gains, to other countries, which'might drain Great Britain of a considerable part of it$ gold and silver. Secondly, that the artificial and prodigious rise of the South-Sea Stock was a dangerous bait, which might decoy many unwary people to their ruin., and allure them by a false prospect of gain, to part with what they bad got by their labour and industry, to purchase -imaginary riches. And in the thira place. That the addition ef above thirty millions new capital, woulfJi give such a vast power to the

minute, from their agents and friends in Westminster:but as soon as it was known, that the Clause offered to cramp the South Sea Company’s project, had been rejected, the stocks of that company, which, since the Commons had accepted their scheme, were gradually risen from 130, to above 300, advanced to near 400; but, after some fluctuation, settled at about 330; in which condition, with little variation, they continued till the end of this month. We must however take notice, That this prodigious rise of the South Sea stock was not altogether owiqg to patural causes, but was rather the result of very artificial engines, and secret springs that were set to work, both at borne and abroad, by those who had no small concern in the success of this affair.” Political State.

South-sea Company, as might endanger the liberties of the nation, and, in time, subvert our excellent constitution; since by their extensive interest they might influence most, if not all the elections of the members, and consequently over-rule the Resolutions of the House of Commons'.

Earl Cowper spoke also against the Bill, and

said, That like the Trojan horse, it was ushered in, and received with great pomp and acclamations of joy; but was contrived for treachery and destruction^ His lordship urged in particular, That in all public bargains, it is a duty incumbent on them who are intrusted with the administration, to cake care that the same be more advantageous to the state than to private persons; but that a quite contrary method seemed to have been followed in the contract made with the South Sea Company s for if the stpeks were kept up to the advanced price to which they had been raised up by the oblique arts of Stock-jobbing, either that company, or its principal members, would gain above thirty millions sterling, of which they gave but one fourth part towards the discharge of the national debts. That though this Scheme carried 'the.face of public good, yet nothing could be 'so, that was founded on injustice, as his lordship took this bill to be: that he apprehended, in particular, that the main public intention of it, viz. the repurchase of annuities, would meet with insuperable difficulties; and that, in such a case, none but a few persons, Who are in the secret, and had early bought stocks at a low rate, and afterwards sold them at a high price, would, in the end, be gainers by this project.

The Duke of Buckingham, and some other Peers, spoke on the same side but

The Earl of Sunderland answered most of their objections: and, among other things, said, That they who encouraged and countenanced, the scheme of the South-Sea Company, had nothing in their view, but the easing the nation of part of that heavy load of debt it labours under; That on the other hand, the managers for that Company had, undoubtedly, a prospect of private gain, either to£themselves, or to their corporation; but thttj, when that scheme was accepted, neither dne one or the other could foresee that the stalks would have risen to the price they were now advanced: That if they had continued as they were at that time, the public would have had the far greater share of the advantage accruing from that, scheme; and if the stocks were kept up to the price they had been raised to, which was not unlikely, it was but reasonable that the South-Sea Company should enjoy the profit procured to it by the wise management and industry of its directors, which would enable it both to make large dividends among its members, and thereby to compass the ends intended by this scheme. After this the question for committing the Bill being' put, it was carried in the affirmative, by a majority of 83 voices against 17.

The South Sea Bill passes the ] April 6. The Lords, in a grand Committee, considered

bf the said Bill, went through it, without any amendment, and without dividing; and on Thursday the 7th of April, 'read it the third time, agreed to it, and sent a message to the Commons to acquaint them therewith.

The King's Message relating to erecting Corporations for insuring Ships and .]

May 4. Mr.Aislabie, Chancellor of the Exchequer, presented to the House of Commons, the following Message fr.mn the King,

“G. R. '

“ His majesty having received several Petitions from great numbers of the most eminent merchants of the City of London, humbly praying, that he would be graciously pleased to grant them his letters patents for erecting corporations to insure ships and merchandize ; *' and the said merchants having offered to advance and pay a considerable sum of money for bio majesty's use, in case they may obtain letters patents accordingly; his majesty being of opinion, that erecting two such corporations exclusive only of all other corporations and societies for insuring of ships and merchandize, <under proper restrictions anckregulations, may he of great advantage and security to the trade and commerce of the kingdom, is willing and desirous to be strengthened by the advice and assistance of this House, in matters of this nature and importance; he therefore hopes for their ready concurrence to secure and confirm the privileges his majesty shall grant to such corporations, and to enable him, to discharge the debts of his civil government, without burdening his people with any new aid or supply:”

Hereupon a Bill was ordered to be brought in, to enable his majesty to grant Letters of Incorporation to the uses and purposes mentioned in his majesty's Message.

May 6. Mr. Henry Pelham made a motion for an Address to return his majesty the thanks of this House, for his gracious condescension,

- . — — — — — — - i

* Several projects were now set on foot, particularly for establishing the two companies of the Royal Assurance, headed by lord Onslow, and of the London Assurance by the lord Cket-wynd. The projectors had been very industrious to bespeak the Countenance of the House of Commons, for which they had causecf two letters to be printed and given to the members. But, these and all other solicitations having proved ineffectual, the managers for the two Companies had recourse to other methods, and being informed that the Civil List was considerably iu arrears (fur which no provision had been, or could conveniently be made by the parliament, because the grarnd committee of Supply had been inadvertently dismissed) they offered to the ministry '600,000l. towards the discharge of that debt, in case they might obtain the king’s charter, with the parliamentary sanction for the establishment of their respective companies. The ministers, being at a loss for means to pay the civil list debt, readily embraced the offer.” Tiridal.

in desiring the advice of this House upon a matter of such importance, as the insurance of ships and merchandize, and to acknowledge his majesty’s goodness in applying the advantages arising to him from such proposals, to the use of his civil government, for the -support of the honour and dignity of the crown, without burdening his people with any new aid or supply:ana to assure his majesty, That this House would most readily concur to make his majesty’s most gracious intentions effectual, for the ease, security, and welfare of his trading subjects. Mr. Pelham being seconded by Mr. Robert Walpole, * it was resolved *o present the said Address, and a Committee was appointed to draw it up.

The Commons* Address thereon.] May 7. Mr. Boscaweu acquainted the House, that the k, ing had given directions, pursuant to the desires of the House, expressed in those two Addresses; and, in the afternoon, the Commons, in a body, waited on his majesty with their Address of thanks for his majesty’s Message as follows:

“ Most Gracious Sovereign;

“ We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, return your majesty our bumble thanks, for communicating to this House

* “ On the 6th of May, Walpole seconded a motion, made by Pelham, for an Address of thanks to the king; on the 4th of June he was appointed Paymaster General of the Forces, and on the 11th, Townshend was nominated President of the Council. Previously, however, to this arrangement, Walpole had, in conjunction with the duke of Devonshire, been . the principal means of effecting a reconciliation •between the king and the prince of Wales, whose misunderstanding had arisen to so alarming a height, as to threaten a disturbance of the public tranquillity. The honour of effecting \ the reconciliationun the royal family was prin-

• cipally due to Walpole. In a conference which lie held with Sunderland, to arrange the plan of a joint administration, the minister, who was averse to the union of the two courts, endeavoured to detach him from the prince, and offered him any conditions for himself and friends, provided he would consent that the prince should remain in disgrace. But Walpole rejected these overtures, and insisted on the reconciliation, as an indispensable preliminary, before he would listen to any terms of coalition. Having extorted this concession, he, with the assistance of the duke of Devonshire, ‘disposed the prince of Wales to write a submissive letter, in which permission was requested to wait upon the king. He was accordingly admitted to a private' conference, and on his return from the palace to Leicester-'house, where he had taken up his residence, was attended by a party of guards, and from that time the father, and son appeared to be reconciled.*’ Coxe’s Walpole.

the application made to yoar majesty for oh# taining the Charters for insuring of Ships end Merchandizes. Your majesty being graciously pleased not to take any steps, in a matter of such importance to the trade and commerce of the kingdom, without the advice and concurrence of your parliament, is au instance of so much condescension, as deserves the highest returns of duty and thankfulness.

“ We acknowledge your majesty's goodness, in applying to the use of the civil government the advantages arising to your majesty from such proposals. It is a great satisfaction to your Commons, to see the honour and, ' dignity of the crown supported under the difficulties, which the necessity of your majesty’s affairs may have occasioned, without lay ing the burden of any new aid or supply upon y our people.

“ And we beg leave to assure your majesty, that this House is resolved to render effectual your majesty’s gracious intentions for the ease, security and welfare of your trading subjects.”

The Kings Answer.] To this Address the King returned the following Answer:

u Gentlemen;

« I receive this Address as a particular mark of your affection to me. It is a new proof to me, and all the world, how much I can always depend upon it. I thank you for it in a particular manner.”

The Kings Speech at the Close of the Session.] June 11. The King came to the House of Peers, and the Commons being sent for and attending his majesty, gave the royal assent to several public and private bills. After which, the Lord Chancellor, by his majesty’s commands, read the following Speech to both Houses:

* My Lords and Gentlemen;

“ I am now come to put an end to this session, which though it hath advanced so far into the summer, dannot be thooght a tedious one, when we consider how much business hath been done, and the great advantages that may be expected from it.

“Your seasonablevigour and perseverance to support me in the measures I have taken with my allies, for restoring the tranquillity of Europe, have produced most of the effects I could desire; much the greatest part of Christendom is already freed from the calamities of war, and by what hath happened both abroad and at home, my people must be convinced, that ~ their welfare is inseparable from the strength and security of my government.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons;

u I return you my thanks for tl»e Supplies you have raised for the service of the current ' year, and it is a particular satisfaction to me, that a method has been found out for making good the deficiencies of my Civil List, without laying any new burthen upon my subjects. The good foundation you have prepared this session for the payment of the National Debt«, and the discharge of a great part of them, without

the least violation of the public faith, will I hope strengthen more ?.nd more the onion I desire to see among all my subjects, and make our friendship yet more valuable to all foreign powers.

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

“ You will see the good effects which our steadiness hath produced; there remains but little on our part, to satisfy the world, that more credit, security and greatness, is to be acquired by following the views of peace, and adhering strictly to just engagements, than by depending on the advantages of war, or by pursuing the.measures of ambition. To com* plate what remains unfinished, 1 propose very speedily to visit my dominions in Germany, boping^to put an end to those troubles in the North, which are now reduced to a very narrow compass. >1 flatter myself, that my presence this summer in those parts will prove use* ful to our poor protestant brethren, for whom you have expressed such seasonable and charitable sentiments.

“ I doubt uot but to meet you again next winter, disposed to put a finishing band to aU those good works which, by your assistance, 1 have brought so near to perfection. I could wish, that aU my subjects, convinced by time and experience, would lay aside those partialities and animosities which prevent them from living quietly, and enjoying the happiness of a mild legal government: it is what I cbu&a to recommend at this time, when I am sensible, that all opposition to it is become vam and useless, and can only end unfortu-tunatefy for those who shall still persist in Struggling against it. I am persuaded that, during my absence, every otae of you will take particular, care to preserve the peace in your several countries, and that I shall find you, at my return, in such a state of tranquillity, as will shew mankind how firmly my government is established; which I chiefly desire, because I think the security and preservation of my people, and of this happy constitution, depends entirely upon it.”

Then the Lord Chancellor, by his majesty's command, prorogued the parliament to the 98th of July: after which it was by several prorogations farther prorogued to the 8th of Pedfember.

year: to whom were added the lord Townshend (who was declared likewise lord president of the council) and the duke of Devonshire., The king in the same council, conferred also several honours and preferments: the earl of Dorset was created duke of Dorset; the earl of Bridgewater, duke of Bridgewater; the lord viscount Castleton, earl Castleton, in the county of York.; Hugh Borcawen, baron Boscawen, and viscount Falmouth in the county of Cornwall J John Wallop, baron Wallop of Wallop, and viscount Ly icing ton in the county of Southampton.

On the lfitb of June, the king embarked at Greenwich, on board the Carolina yacht, and landed the next, morning at Helvoetsluys, from whence he proceeded to Hanover.

Whilst the king was employed abroad in hearing and settling the grievances and interests of the nations and their sovereigns, particularly those Of the protestants of Germany, the Regency were no less employed at home in curbing the excessive desire of gain, which the progress of the South Sea Company had raised, and in curing the despair which attended its fall. As these are the most considerable events of this reign, and such as will never be forgot by Great Britain, they deserve to be related at Urge.

When the Bill passed in favourof the South Sea Company, it was expected, the stock would ' have greatly advanced, but the contrary hap- pened; for the day after it fell from 310 to 290. In order to raise it, a rumour was spread,

that earl Stanhope had received overtures iq France to exchange Gibraltar and Port-Ma-hon for some places In Peru, for the security and enlargement of the English trade in the South Sea; which had its effect in Exchange-alley. For, on the 12th of April, five days after the royal assent was given to the biJb the directors -opened their, books for a subscript tioo-of a million, at the rate of 300/. for every 100/. capital. Such was the concourse oSf persons ef all ranks, that this first subscription was found to amount to above two millions of original stock. It was to be paid at five payments of 60/. each, for one share of 100/. In a few days the stock advanced to 340, and the subscriptions were sold for double the price of the first payment To raise the stock still higher, on the 21st of April it was declared ip a General Court, that the Midsummer dividend should be ten per cent, and all subscriptions should be entitled to the same. These Resolutions answering the end designed, the Directors, to improve the infatuation of the monied men, opened their books for a second subscription of one million, at 400/. per eeat. In a few hours* no less than a million and a half was subscribed at that rate; and so great was the confidence which was placed in the Directors, that many deposited in their bands their annuities, without knowing what price the company would allow for them.

On the 19th of May, the Directors thought fit to settle the terms and prices for the lmig

#33] PARL. HISTORY, 6 George I. 17SO. — Progress of the South {654

and short annuities, which'Had been subscribed; and the stbek being that day 375/. per cent. it was resolved to allow, for every 100/. per annum of the long annuities, TOO/, in the capital stdck (which at 375/. per cent, amounted .to 2, 025/.) and 575/. in bonds and money: So the total for each 100/. per annum amounted to 3, 200/. or-thirty-twO years purchase. For every 90/. per annum of the snort annuities, they agreed to allow 350/. in the capital stock, ^vhich at 375/. percent, amounted to 1312/. 10s. and'in bonds and money, 317/. 10s. which together made 1530/. or'seventeen years purchase.

These offers occasioned at first great mur-raurings among the Annuitants, who, having" expected ten years, found they were to have but eight years and a quarter's purchase. Upon which some withdrew their orders, and others -resolved not to subscribe. But the South Sea managers having found means' to raise their Stock to 500/. per cent, most of the annuitants appeared easy; so that it was computed, that, by the 29th of May, almost two thirds of the annuities were subscribed.

The arts of the stockjobbers drew a great (Concourse of persons of all ranks into Exchange alley, by whose unexampled eagerness of laying out their money in a fund, that promised so plentiful a return of gain, that stock, which about the latter end of May, was at about 550, fose On a sudden so prodigiously, that on Thursday, - the-'Sd of June, it came up to 690. Many cautious persons being willing to take this Opportunity to secure their great profits, there appeared the next day so many sellers in the alley, that, by two or three o'clock in the afternoon, the ptock fell to 640; at which the Chief Directors of the South Sea Company, being alarmed, set their agents to work, by whose artful management the stock was the same evening advanced to 750; about which price, with some small fluctuation, it continued till the closing of the Company's books on the 22d of June. In the mean time, the South Sea stock suffered a considerable shock. For many persons, who were to follow the king to Hanover, and others, who found a difficulty of making their second payment to the first subscription, were both equally desirous to turn their stock into money; so that, for some days, the number of sellers exceeded that of buyers. Wherefore the managers of the Company formed two expedients: the first was their lending out money, or notes, to the proprietors of their capital stock, to the sum of 400/. upon 100/. original stock (which shewed it to be worth above that sum) at the rate of 4/. per cent, per annum. The second was their giving public notice, “ That all persons possessed of any of the Company's bonds, which fell due ou the 25tty of June, might then have their ihoney for the same of the Company’s cashier: and that the bonds would be taken in on the •econd payment for the 2, 250,000l. South Sea •tuck, sola by subscription after the rate of 300/. for each 100/." original stock." By these

means money being plenty, and the stock* jobbers in good humour, the South Sea Company opened their books for a third subscript lion, at the rate of 1,000l. for each 100/. capital stock, to be paid in ten equal payments, one in hand, and the ether nine half-yearly. But some men in power haring taken this opportunity to oblige their friends, their lists were so foil, that the Directors enlarged it to four millions capital stock, which at that price amounted to forty millions sterling. And, what is more strange, these last subscriptions were, before the end of June, sold at above' per cent, advance, and, after the closing of the transfer-books, the original stock rose to above 1,000l. per cent. At the same time the first subscriptions were at 560, and the second at 610 per cent, advance, the Bank at 260, and East India at 440.

The whole nation was Become stock-jobbers. The South Sea was like an infectious distemper, which spread itself in an astonishing manner. Every evening produced new projects, which were justly called Bubbles, new Companies appeared every day. These were countenanced by the greatest of the nqbility. The prince of Wales* was governor of the Welsh Copper; the duke of Chandois, of York Buildings; the duke of Bridgewater formed a company for building houses in London and Westminster. There were near a hundred different kinds of prbjects or bubbles; and it was computed/ that above a million and a half was won and lost by these unwarrantable practices, by which many unwary persons were defrauded and impoverished, and a few crafty men enriched, to the great detriment of domestic trade. Tb* king had, jhe same day the parliament rose, published a Proclamation, ']' declaring all these unlawful projects should be deemed as common nuisances, and prosecuted as such; with the penalty of 500/. for any broker to buy or sell any shares in them. Notwithstanding this

* “ The Speaker and Mr. Walpole could not dissuade the Prince from being governor of this Copper Company, - though they told him he would be prosecuted, mentioned in parliament, and cried in the Alley, upon the foot of Onslow’s Insurance; Chetwynde'S Bubble, pripce of Wales's Bubble, &c. he has already got 40,000l. by it.” Coxe's Walpole. Correspondence; secretary Craggs to earl Stanhope ^

f “ This Proclamation put a stop to the lata pernicious projects and undertakings, which to the number of about' a hundred, were first set on foot and promoted by crafty knaves; then pursued by multitudes of covetous fools; and, at last, appeared to be in effect, what their vulgar appellation denoted them to be, viz. Bubbles, or mere cheats. It was computed, that near one million and a half sterling, was won or lost by these extravagant and unwarrantable practices, whereby many tmwarr persons were defrauded and impoverished, ana §. few busy upstarts enriched, to the great de* triment of domestic trade.” Political State. *

1. ..

In London stands a famous pile.

And near that pile an Alley,

Where merry crowds for riches toil.

And wisdom stoops to folly.

Here sad and joyful, high and low.

Court Fortune for her graces;

And as she smiles, or frowns, they show Their gestures and grimaces.

2.

Here stars and .garters do appear,

Among our lords the rabble:

To buy and sell, to see and hear The jJews and Gentiles squabble.

Here crafty courtiers are too wise

For those who trust to fortune; ’

They see the cheat with clearer eyes,

Who peep behind the curtain.

Our greatest ladies hither come,

* And ply in chariots daily;

Oft pawn their jewels for a sum,

To venture in the AJley.

Young harlots too, from Drury Lane, Approach the 'Change in coaches.

To fool away the gold they gain By their obscene debauches.

4.

Long-Heads may thrive by sober rules. Because they think, and drink not;

But Headlongs are our thriving fools. Who only drink, and think not.

The lucky rogues, like Spaniel dogs, Leap into South Sea water *

And there they fish for golden frogs.

Not caring what comes a'ter.

5.

' Tis said, that Alchymists of old Could turn a brazen kettle.

Or leaden cistern into gold.

That noble, tempting metal:

But if it here may be allowed

To bring in great and small things.

Our cunning South Sea, like a god.

Turns nothing into all things.

6.

What need have we of Indian wealth.

Or commerce with our neighbours ? Our constitution is in health,

And riches crown our labours.

Our South Sea ships have golden shrouds, They bring us wealth, 'tis granted;

But lodge their treasure in the clouds,

To hide it till it's wanted.

7.

O Britain, bless thy present state,

Thou only happy nation;

So oddly rich, so madly great,

Since Bubbles came in fashion! Successful rakes exert their pride.

And count their airy millions;

Whilst homely drabs m coaches ride. Brought, up to town on pillions.

8.

Few men, who follow reason's rules, Grow fat with South Sea diet;

Young rattles and unthinking fools Are those that flourish by it.

Old musty jades, and pushing blades, Who’ve least consideration,

Grow rich apace; whilst wiser heads Are struck with admiration.

A race of men, who t'other day Lay crush’d beneath disasters.

Are now by Stock brought into play. And made oar lords and masters.

8th of July, resolved to open their books for taking in subscriptions of the lottery tickets, and other short annuities, to the amount of six millions sterling: But, though they did not then think fit to declare at what rate they designed to take those effects, yet the proprietors entirely trusted to their integrity, and readily subscribed the 'same on the 14th and 15th of that month. After which the books were shut up. From that time to the end of July, the stock fell gradually from about 1000 to 900, including the Midsummer dividend. In the mean time, it being confidently reported, that the capital stock was to be inlarged by a fourth subscription in money, some persons in eminent stations desired the principal managers to put off the subscription, till the proprietors of the remaining part of the long annuities had subscribed, since the taking in of those public debts, in order to make them redeemable, was the main view, upon which the ministry and the parliament thought fit to encourage the South-Sea project. Some pretend, that the men in power made this step, not only to free themselves from the importunity of many, who sued to be set down in their lists, for a share in the next subscription; but also, in order to reserve part of the to be increased capital stock, till a new set of directors were choserfi'who should have a share in the profits of future subscriptions, in case the humour of buying up the same at an advanced price should last so long. However that be, in a -committee of the Directors the 27th of July, it being considered that several persons, admitted as subscribers to the third subscription in money, had not yet made their first payment, it was resolved, . That none but the Proprietors of their capital and increased stock should be admitted into the next subscription in money, at the rate of 20 per cent, so that a proprietor of 1,000l. capital stock should be intided to subscribe 200/. In this Resolution, they twho hitherto bad carried on this great project, with equal skill and success, had undoubtedly two things in view; first, to allay the murmurings of many of the old proprietors, who complained, that the directors and. great men at court had ingrossed for themselves and their dependants most of the profits of the three first subscriptions. And, secondly, That, in case the eagerness of buyers should abate, which was to be apprehended from the daily sinking of the price of South-Sea stock, the

company might be assured, that the new sub* scribers would make the several payments, to which they should submit themselves, and for which their capital stock would be a sufficient security. On the other hand, many of the old proprietors were so far from looking upon this Resolution as a favour, that on the contrary, they did not stick to say, That the directors, having had cream for themselves, would now ‘ give the proprietors the sour milk/ This complaint seemed to be the better grounded, because it was well known that those, who had got most by the South-Sea, daily endeavoured to sell out, and secure their vast profits; and, in particular, that the principal projector of this scheme had bought considerable estates in Norfolk and other counties. *

Pursuant to what had been desired, it wa* resolved on the 3d of August, at a Court of Directors, to receive subscriptions of all the remaining Long and Short annuities, Lottery Tickets, and other Public Securities, both redeemable and irredeemable. For which purpose the Books were opened the next day at the South-Sea house, and continued so till the 11th of August. The day after, the Directors published the terms they intended to allow to the proprietors. For every 100/. a year of the Long Annuities, they offered 400/. in the .capital stock which at 800/. per cent, (the' price then of stock, exclusive of the Midsummer dividend) amounted to 3, 200/., and in bonds or money 400/. making in all 3, 600/. or 36 years’ purchase. For every 90/. a year of the’Short Annuities they allowed 200/. stock, which at 800/. per cent, amounted to 1, 600/. or 17 years’ purchase, and 7-ninths. The redeemable Annuities and debts (as well those at per cent, as those at 5 per cent.) were to be taken in at 105 per cent, and allowed for the same in capital stock at the rate of «00/. percent, exclusive of the Midsummer dividend.

Many of the Annuitants were not satisfied with these offers, which, they said, put so great a disparity (no less than near half by half) between them and the former subscribers; for, by the resolution of the Directors of the 19th of May, there was allowed, for every 100/. a year of the Long Annuities, 700/. in the capital stock,

* IIow great the general infatuation or thirst of gain was, appears from the following instance: A proposal was offered ‘ For carrying ‘ on an undertaking of great advantage, but

* nobody to know what it is.’ The projector formed a scheme for half a million, by which every subscriber, paying down two guineas for subscribing, was to have 100/. a year for every 100/. so subscribed. But how this was to be done did not appear in the proposals, where it was also said, that in a month the particulars of the project should be laid open, and the money subscribed was then to be paid in. As extravagant as this scheme was, the projector in a forenoon received 1000 subscriptions, with which, amounting to 2,000 guineas, he went off in the afternoon.

663] PARL. HISTORY, 7 George

besides 10/. per cent, for the Midsummer dividend, and, in bonds or money, 57 all which (computing the stock at 800/.. per cent. ae.it was given to the present subscriber# of the like annuities) amnuuted to 6, 735/. whereas, by these last Resolutions, there was allowed, for-the same Annuities, only 3, 600/. For this reason some of the la&t subscribers went to the South-Sea house, in order to withdraw their effects; , but they were told by the clerks, that Ibere was no order from the directors for delivering them back; so the affair rested, for Some time, uudetermined.

The uneasiness of the Annuitant?, put a fresh damp upon the South-Sea stock; but what affected it more was the boldness of many persons concerned in the illegal projects, who, in open defiance to the late acts of parliaments, to the king's proclamation, and to the orders and prohibitions of the Lords Justices, carried them on. Some of these companies, authorised either by charters or acts of parliament, did considerable prejudice to the South-Sea, by endeavouring to procure subscriptions. Upon . this, the principad Directors of the South-Sea applied to those at the helm, and obtained an Order against them from the Lords Justices, which was published in the Lontlon Gazette of August the 30th, and which greatly affected the stocks of the York-Buildings Company, the Lustring Company, the English Copper, and the Welsh Copper and Lead, and of other illegal projects. This very much alarmed the person# concerned in these companies, some of, whom sustained considerable losses, and all of them saw their extravagant hopes and expectations entirely vanish. Upon the murmurings " occasioned by their disappointment, the Lords Justices ordered the Directors of these Companies to attend them at a general council, the 23d-of August, where they condescended to tell them the reasons, that had obliged them to order a prosecution against them. The Directors, both of the Royal Exchange, and of the London Assurance, attended likewise, and were cautioned to keep strictly to the limitation of their charters, that no complaint might lie ' against them.

The Companies ordered to be prosecuted, Uhving recovered their fright, and consulted able lawyers, seemed resolved to stand trial, and assert their rights of managing their own affairs as they pleased. The Welsh Copper miners were yet more bold and refractory, for 4that very day (August 23) they opened their books, and made transfer of their stock.

• Before the Lords Justices had caused their order to be published, they sent a compliment to the prince of Wales, to acquaint him, that, the Company of English Copper, of which he had been pleased to be chosen governor, being illegal, they were obliged to involve it in the order; upon which the Prince sent a messenger - to the Company, desiring them to choose another governor.

All this while the Sonth-Sea Stock continued sinking; so that on the 17th of August, it fel|

to 830, including the Midsummer dividend which having given the directors no small un- . easiness, some of their agents were immediately detached into Exchange-Alley, to buy a coiw siderable quantity of stock, which thereupon. rose to 880/. But, the humour of selling out continuing the two following days, the stocks. fell again to 820, at which price the transfer books were opened on the 22d of August. That day, apd the next morning, there was a great croud at the South^Sea house; and the directors observing, that great quantities of stock had been bought at a thousand, pnd even at higher rates, for the opening of the books, . and that many persons would be obliged to sell -out, in order to pay the difference, which could not fail of sinking the stock yet lower, they, ' came to a sudden and unexpected resolution to shut the transfer books; and the next day to open other books, for taking in a money subscription of one million, to the capital stock, at the rate of J,000l. for every 100/. capital stock, to be pqid in five payments, 20/. per cent, in hand, and the rest in four equal payments. Accordingly the subscription books were opened the 24th of August; and there was such a crowd of subscribers, and amongst them not a few of^.ie prime nobility, that, in less than three hours, more than the intended i sum was subscribed; and that very afternoon this fourth subscription was sold in Exchange Alley at 30 or 40 per cent, advance. The next day the principal directors, having consulted together about their future management; came to several Resolutions, of which, that very evening, they informed the public by the fob-lowing Advertisement:

South-Sea, Aug. 25, 1720,

‘ The court of directors of the South-Sea Company give notice; that the transfer books

< of the company will be shut from the 31st day ‘ of August to the 21st of September, in ordjgr ‘ to the admitting as well the proprietors of the

* prietors of the stock for all the Long Aqnui-‘ ties, 9 per cents, and Tickets of Lottery f710,

* vised to be subscribed -into the capital stock, , ‘ and also the proprietors of the first, second,

* will be excluded the benefit of the subscrfp-

* lion. ’

The next day (August the 26th) the transfer-books tverc opened again; but, the South-sea stock, instead of advancing, being by tins time fallen under 800, the directors, who had now large sums of money ii\ their hands, thought fit to lend to their proprietors 4000/. upon every 1000/. stock for six mouths, at the rate of 4* per cent., which enabled some of those, who had Ijought stock at a higher price, than the present, to satisfy their creditors. What still embarrassed the directors was the case of the Annuitants and others, who had lately subscribed their public securities, and %vho thought it a great hardship to have the stock given them at 800/. per cent, when it was now little above 700, exclusive of the Midsummer dividend. In order to silence these and the like tnurinurings, o long consultation, on the 30th of August, after the directors came to a resolution, “ That 30 per cent, in money should be the half year’s dividend due at Christmas next; and from thence for twelve years, not less than 50 per Cent, in money should be the yearly dividend on their stock/’ What effect this resolution had, was soon after manifest; for, though it raised the stock to about 800 for the opening of the books, yet it soon sunk again, and in about three weeks fell gradually below 400.

The Directors, having resolved the future dividends, thought it time to procure the sanction of the whole corporation; for which purpose they appointed (Sept. 8.) a General Court to be held at Merchant-Taylors-Hall, declaring, That this assembly would be ooe of the half-yearly general courts appointed by the charter, and to chuse a committee of seven, to inspect the by-laws.

On the appointed day, the friendsofthe Directors took care to repair betimes to Merchant-Taylors-Hall, which, by nine o’clock in the irtorning, was filled; and many proprietors and annuitants, who endeavoured to get in, could not gain admittance. The directors having taken their seats between eleven and twelve o’clock, sir John Fellows, sub-governor, acquainted the assembly with the occasion of their meeting; read to them the several Resolutions of the Court of Directors:and gave them an account of their proceedings; of the taking in both the redeemable and unredeemable funds, and of the subscriptions in. money. This done, Mr. Craggs^enior, made a short speech, wherein be commended the conduct of the Directors; and' urged, that nothing could more effectually contribute tit the bringing this scheme to.perfection than union among themselves; and concluded with a motion, for thanking the court of Directors for their prudent and skilful management, And for desiring them to proceed in such methods, as they should think most proper for the interest and advantage of the corporation.

Mr. Craggs was seconded, by Mr. Hunger-ford, who said, / That he had seen the rise

* and fall, the decay and resurrection of many

‘ communities b*f this natufe, but that, in hrs Opinion, noire ever performed "such wonderful

* things in so short a time, as the South-Sea ma-‘ nagers had brought about: that the'y had donfe ‘ more than the crown, the pulpit, and the fnn-

* gistrate could do: for they had reconciled all

* parties in one common interest, and thereby ‘ laid asleep, if not wholly extinguished, otir ‘ domestic jars and animosities: that by the

* rise of their stocks the monied-men had vastly

* increased their fortunes:the country gentle-‘ men had seen the value of their lands doubled

* and. trebled in their hands; and they had, at

* the same time, done good to the church, not a

* few of the reverend clergy havirt£ got great 1 sums by this project: that, in short, they had

* inriched the whole nation; and tie hoped they

* had not forgot themselves.’ One or two members of the assembly having offered to speak in favour of the annuitants, to censure the conduct of the directors, they were presently hissed to silence; and Mr. Hungerford, resuming his speech, continued justifying and applauding the directors, and concluded with supporting Mr. Craggs’s motion. The duke of Portland spoke on the same side, and said, that he did

* not know what reasons any body had to be

f dis-satisfied ; ’ and gave in a draught of the motion for returning thanks to the directors; which being read by the clerk, it Was unanimous) v approved. It was likewise agreed, that, according to the Resolution of the Directors, “ the next Christmas dividend on the stock and subscriptions in money should be 30 per cent, and that a dividend of not less than 50 percent, per annum be made from Christmas next, in halfyearly payments, for not less than twelve years, upon the whole stock and sub* scriptions.” They likewise agreed with the Court of Directors, to omit the 20 per cent, subscription in money, which had been intended for the proprietors of the original stock and former subscriptions. After which a motion'' was made, “ That the last subscribers, both of the redeemable and irredeemable funds, should have the alternative, either to withdraw their orders, or accept the terms offered them by the Court of Directors.” But, the question being put, it was carried in the negative, three or four voices excepted. Then, upon the earl of Orkney’s motion, the general court was adjourned. (

But, though the Directors carried their main point in the general court, yet the negative put upon the motion, in the behalf of the last subscribers, highly increased the public discontent, and raised such a distrust of the honesty of the managers, that the same day (Sept. 8.) the stocks fell to 640, and, on the morrow, to 550. Upon this, the directors resolved to open the transfer-books the Monday following, which having thrown some damp upon the Stock-jobbing in the Alley, the South-Sea rose that day (Sept. 9,) to 640. On the other hand, several of the last subscribers of annuities went with a public notary to the Sonth-Sea House, to demand their orders; and upon the refusal of the officers to

• . / \

C67] PARL. HISTORY, 7 George I. 1720. — Principal Occurrences: [CC8

deliver them, the proprietors made their . protests in due form, and resolved to seek their remedy at law. In the mean time, they loudly, complained of the unfair manner, in which they were drawn in to subscribe their annuities, for, it seems, at the top.of every page of the subscription-book, 'there was a short letter of attorney, whereby tl>e subscribers impowered three persons, therein named, to accept such terms, as the company should think lit to give them for their effects; which they alledged to be a mere trick, not one in a hundred of the subscribers having read the insnaring preamble.

On the 10th of September, the directors caused the following advertisement to be published:< The court of directors give notice,

* that the .dividends for Christmas next, and

* afterwards, voted by the general court on the ‘ 8th of September, which shall become due on ‘ the four money subscriptions, already taken ‘ for the sale of the stock of the company, will

* be allowed in part of the payments, which shall

* become due on the subscriptions; and that 1 the 10 per cent, stock for the last Midsummer 1 dividend, on the first; second and third of the

* money subscriptions, will be intitled to the

* like dividends, and be allowed in further part 1 of the payment on those subscriptions. And

* whereas the transfer-books of the company ‘ were advertised to be shut from the 31st of

* August last, to the 21st of September, in order ' ‘ to the making the subscriptions of 20 per

* cent, intended for the proprietors; and the

* general court having since agreed, that this

* subscription be omitted, the court of directors

* give notice, That the transfer-books will be '

* opened on the 12th instant, and will continue

* open as usual. ’

Some of the managers vainly expected, that this advertisement would have contributed to the keeping up the stock; but, as it continued sinking, they were obliged to have recourse to more effectual methods. They made some secret advances towards an union with the East-India company; but, a secret Committee of that company, appointed to consider of their offers, not having thought proper to accept them, they were forced to court the assistance of their rival, the Bank of England. At the earnest desire, and by the zealous interposition of Mr. Secretary Craggs, several conferences were held between a select number of the directors of those two corporations; which raised so great an expectation, that on the 12th of September *, in the morning, upon a report,

mercy; those whoe doe nott, are to be opprest in such manner, as shall make what is due to them of Httle use; and all this, I suppose, they are to be supported in, having engaged the. House of Commons soe far in their interest, by wayes obvious to every body, that I thinke the nation will bee to beare such part of the losse sustained by private persons, as the company shall thinke fitt; whilst the gaine Obtained by fraud and vi.llanous practices, is to turne to their advantage. I foresaw this from the beginning, and have as many witnesses of itt, as persons I converst with; but I owne, I thought they would have carryed on the cheat somewhat longer. Various are the conjectures why they suffered the cloud to breake soe early, I made noe doubt butt’twould doe soe when they found itt for their advantage, which nott being the case just att this time, some other reason must bee found; and the true one I take to bee, stretching creditt soe far beyond what ’twould beare, that specie proves deficient for supporting itt, by circulating paper. It is observable, that many of their most considerable men, with their fast friends, the tories, jacobites, and papists (for these they have all along hugged) have drawne out, securing themselves by the losses of the deluded thoughtlesse numbers, whose understandings were overruled by avarice, and hopes of making mountains of mole hills. Thousands of familyes will be reduced to beg-gery, what the consequences of that will bee, time must shew; I know what I thought from the beginning, and feare ’tis very near att hand.

The consternation is inexpressible, the rage beyond expression, and the case so desperate, that I doe nott see any plan or scheme, so much as thought of, for averting the blow, soe that I can’t pretend to guesse att what is next to beo done.

“ Sept. 27. The Company have yett come to noe determination, for they are in such a wood, that they know nott which way to. turne, butt ’tis, given out (I suppose by direction) that they will lower the price of the third and fourth subscriptions, and offer more reasonable termes to the redeemables, leaving to their option the^ acceptance, or returoe of their severall securities, these to remain on the foote they are, till discharged by payment ih mony; noe doubt att first they intended nothing lesse, but as Mr. Budgell told them in the general! court, since the mountain would nott come to Mahomet, hee must goe toe the mountaine.

but in the afternoon, as soon as that report was. known to? be groundless, the stock fell again to 580; the next day to 570, and so gradually to 400; which increased the murmurings and complaints of the last subscribers, and exposed several of the directors to public insults.

Mr. Robert Walpole, who was paymaster of the army, and lived the greatest part of that summer in the country, to avoid giving offence to those that had, with the directors, the management of the South-Sea affairs, being then thought to have great credit and influence with the Bank, was sent for out of the country, and importuned to use his interest to induce the Bank to agree to a Proposal made by the

“ Your remark is very just, that if this great Leviathan intended to have been directors of the whole national affairs, as well as of the company doe fall, itt will necessarily occasion, such a convulsion, as noe honest man desires; but I think there remains a middle way between the two extremes, by supporting their creditt, as far as in reason, itt ought to bee supported, distinguishing between what ought properly to bee call’d creditt, and chimerical! calculations, and the one is certainly practicable, without running into the other. A great many goldsmiths are already gone of, and more will daily. I question whether one third, nay a fourth can stand itt; the cause of which, is this, those whoe had either originally, or buying with mony . gott by taking differences, run into pretty considerable quantityes of stock, nott being therewith content, butt resolving to sitt down with nothing Jesse then hundred thousands, in order to obtaine which, gave vast premiums to the goldsmiths for mony, pawning their stock, some att four, others att five and six hundred, this being lookt uppoa as good as land security: the money thus lent by the goldsmiths was in cash notes, which whilst paper had creditt, answered the end as well as specie; butt assoon as a run was uppon them, they found (by reason of the stocks sinking) their pledges would nott produce cash to answer their notes, and thus one after another are they every day going of.

* From the very beginning, I founded my judgment of the whole affair uppon this unquestionable maxim, that ten millions (which is more then our running cash) would not circulate two hundred millions, beyond which our paper ere-1 ditt extended; that therefore, when ever that should become doubtfull, bee the cause what itt would, our noble state machine must inevitably fall to the ground, or att best bee brought within soe. much a narrower compasse then what was projected, that our most Sanguine people would find nothing more appositely expressive of their vain hopes then

“ I endeavoured, with an honest and friend-

South-Sea Company, for circulating a number of their bonds.

It is to be observed that nothing of this kind arose from the Bank, or was at their motion:and, as far as it appears, nothing but an apprehension of the people’s resentment, with which they were loudly threatened, could have prevailed with the Bank to have treated at all with the South-Sea Company, and involve themselves in their calamities! But the clamour was irresistible, and the Bank, out of necessity, hearkened to the Proposals of the South-Sea Company; for from them every step and motion proceeded.

The first expedient was for the Bank to circulate bonds of the South-Sea Company to a certain value for a time to be agreed upon, and a proposal to that effect was, on the 16th of September, sent to the Bank by the Sub and Deputy Governors of the South-Sea Company.

This not being relished immediately, it was proposed, that there should be a meeting of a Committee, consisting of five of each Company, at the post-master’s house, where were likewise present, lord president, Mr. Secretary Craggs, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr. Craggs, post-master-general f. The meeting was on

ly intention, to persuade as many of my friends as I conversed with, to secure the main chance, and nott dip (at least) out of their depth, in case they should resolve to goe with the current. Some few were prevailed uppon by such arguments as 1 thought well founded, whose hearty thanks and acknowledgments I have receiv’d; butt the far greater part concluding (as I must own I did) that the. thing would have been car-ryed on for some longer time, have on this supposition, run themselves aground, which they dearly repent: into this they were generally ! lead by assurances from the gent, whose nose bled, and whoe himselfe was certainly duped by the honest directors from whom hee receiv’d information, whilst they were all the time (underhand) selling out as fast as they could. That he was duped, I thinke past doubt, from his having by his influence, brought all his particular friends, and even his owne family and nearest relations, soe far into the mire, as that few of them will, during their lives, surmount the losse, others of them are soe totally undone, a9 to bee beyond possibility of retrieving itt. Possibly, before the end of next session, I may bee called a South Sea-man, for I shall nott join with those whose losses have soe far exasperated them, as to bee desirous, out of revenge, to run into extremes, which may . endanger the nation.

19th of September, three days after the Proposal.

This conference lasted many hours, with great reluctance on the part of the Bipik, but was pressed with so much, eagerness and authority on the other side, th^t the Ra&k was prevailed upon to yield.

It was thought proper, before they parted, that something should be reduced into writing, as a minute of the substance of what had beeu under consideration, and to serve as a foundation of a future agreement or contract between the. two companies.

There was some little dispute who should draw the Minute, hut it being the general desire of the company, that Mr. Walpole should do it, in the presence.of the whole meeting, he ^>ut down in writing what has ever since been galled, The Bank Contract, and which was in the following words: That the Bank of Eng-

* land sb, dl undertake to circulate three mil-

* lions of South-Sea bonds for one year, at a

* premium to be agreed upon by t.he two com-‘panics; a subscription to be taken, for , ena-

4 bling the Bank tp parry on the circulation, —

' percent, to be paid down by every subscriber,

* and — per cent. supon every call at a fbrt-night’s notice; the contract with the sub-

‘ senbers to be made in the nature and form with ‘ former contracts, for circulating Exchequer

* bills, and the charges of circulation to be borne

* by the South-Sea company. That, in consideration of this undertaking, the South-Sea 4 company shall pay the 3, 700,000l. to he

* paid to the Bank, by notice of parliament, in South-Sea stock, at a price to be agreed on

* between the t>vo companies ’

This Paper (which was all that Mr. Walpole ever wrote relating to the affair; for at the .other meetings he was never once present) had .no title or preamble, signifying what it imported: the premium for circulating, and what was to be paid down for the circulation, was left blank, and the most material part of the whole, at what price the Bank was to take the South Sea Stock for 3, 700,000l. was referred to a subsequent agreement. So it could not, with any propriety, be ended a Contract, but rather a rough draugiit of an agreement, void of all form or any manner of obligation.

The next day after this meeting ($ept. 20) there was a General Court of the South Sea Company, at Merchaut-Taylpr’s-hall, where sir John .Fellows, the sub-governor, acquainted the pi, ‘ That, since their last meeting, their stock having taken an unexpected turn to the 4disadvantage of the company, the directors, 4had been consulting what might be most for ‘ the benefit of the corporation; and considering ‘the great credit the Bank of England lu\d . 4Justly gained, both at home and. abroad, they ‘ had thought it for their interest, to treat with t

* that company for the circulating their bonds, 1 ‘ and to4 grant them stock at a moderate price ff in lieu of the 3, 700,000l. which the South-Sea

* Company was, to pay tjiem , at j-ady^day pod Michaelmas, 1721, And tha^frjpq.!

4 of the meeting they had the night before with

* some gentlemen of the Bai.ik, and some per-‘ sons of the first rank, they doubted not but

* such an agreement might soon be perfected/ HereupoirMr. Dawson moved, That the di-

* rectors be impowered to agree with the Bank of England, or any other persons, to circulate

* the company’s bonds, op make any other agreement with the Bank, which they should

4judge proper:* and he was seconded by sir John Eyles. Hereupon Mr. Hungerford moved' for amending the latter part of the question, by making express mention of that other agreement. But Mr. Pulteney spoke for the question, and thought it best to use a latitude of expression, and so leave the directors at liberty to act as they should think proper for the interest of the company. He added, 4 That it ‘ was a matter of surprise to see what a panic had seized upon the minds' of the people, at a 4 time when the nation was in profound peace,

4 and had nothing to fear, either at home or from abroad. That, indeed, a rumour had been universally spread, as if the armament

* of the Spaniards was designed either against Port Mahon or Gibraltar; hut that he took

* that report to be altogether-false and ground-/ less, and only intended to scandalize that potentate, and to terrify the people here; for (he himself had seen ana perused a copy of a ‘ letter, written by the express command of the king of Spain by his secretary of state to the British minister at Madrid, absolutely denying,

* in the strongest terms, any designs of the Spanish forces against any of his Britannic

* majesty’s dominions. That he was as much concerned in the company as most people;

4 but that notwithstanding this general and terri-‘ ble alarm, he had not disposed of any part of his stock; for he would think it a scandal to be ‘ rich, if the nation were ruiued. That, how-4ever, |ie hoped the case would be quite other- wi$e; and he doubted not but the company would soon be restored to its former flourishing condition, since it was like to be supported by the Bank of Englartd, a corporation, who by wise, though slow and cautious measures, hqd

* established its credit, not only athome, biit ‘.even among foreigners/ Upon this the question was unanimously agreed to. Sir John Fellows then farther acquainted the assembly, 4 That,

‘ the proprietors of the several annuities lately

* subscribed, as vyell as those interested in the two last money-subscriptions, being very much ‘dissatisfied, fearing thereby to be great losers,

the directors had thought it proper, that the terpos should be lowered to make them ‘.easy/ Whereupon sir Matthew Decker moved, ‘ That power be given to the director *

‘ to relieve the annuitants, vyho came in upon ‘ the last subscription: as likewise the proprietors of the third and fourth money-subscrip-‘ tions.’ He was seconded by Mr. Craggs, Senior, who among other things, said, 4 That iio —

4 thing could he more reasonable sind just, than ‘ to give satisfaction to people who. had trusted ‘ th^r.fprtapes and es^a^ with the coqippy *

* and that it would be a notorious robbery to

* take any advantage of their confidence in the honour and integrity of the.directors.’ Tins gave occasion to Mr. Budgel* to reflect in a speech, on the prodigious leap, from a subscription of 4 00/. to one of 1,000l. which left such a gap in the building, as would at last bring it to the ground. He then observed, that the fall of the stock was owing to the malicious rumour, that two or three of the very directors had basely betrayed the trust reposed in them. When he had done speaking, Mr. Chester, one of the directors, spoke in vindication of his brethren, and said, That he knew of no proceedings among them, but what were intended for thegood of the jvhole company: thatforhisown part, he had not sold any of his stock, nor reserved to'himself any more of the subscriptions

* than what was allowed tp each of the directors; and that his fortune would have been as large, if he had not been a director; that as to the great gap between the second and

* third subscription, in money, which was objected as a wrong step in the management of

* the company's affairs, he could assure them, 4 that it was none of the directors fault, since they designed to have made the third subscription at five or six jmudred; bur, the hu- mourand eagerness of the people having run up the South Sea Stock to seven or eight

* c Let Budgel charge low Grub-Street on his quill,

* t And write whate’er he pleased, except his Will."

44 The last line alludes to Tindal’s Will: by which, and other indirect practices, Budgel, to the exclusion of the next heir, a nephew, got to himself almost the whole fortune of a man entirely unrelated t6 him. Respecting the circumstance hinted £t, of Eustace Budgel having forged Dr. Tindal’s Will, the reader might perhaps wish to have soma further account. Dr. .Tindal, of All Souls College, Oxford, of notorious character, the Author of Christianity as old as the Creation, left the following AVill,

“The reverend Nicholas Tindal, . his nephew, author of the Continuation of Kapin, declared his suspicion that this Will was forged. This was generally credited, and Budgel, in 1737, threw himself out of a boat and was drowned. He wrote several of the Spectators; the History of the Boyles, earls of Shannon, &c. and a weekly pamphlet called the Bee. The cause of his death was supposed to have been in relation to this Will."

4 hundred, they could not in prurience open- a 4 subscription, at less thnu a thousand.’ The assembly seemed to be very well pleased with Mr. Chester’s speech; but pinny wondered, that none of his brethren took that opportunity to clear themselves, as he had done. Upon the whole matter, the court unanimously agreed to the question for relieving the last subscribers,

1 and then adjourned.

Two days after, Sept." 22, there was a General Court of the Bunk of England, when tire governor acquainted them, that this «as one of their quarterly and half yearly meetings, and that their directors had come to a resolution to declare the last half-yearly dividend at four per cent; to which the court hav ing unanimously agreed, the governor proceeded, saying, 4 He presumed, none could be ignorant there had of late been divers meetings and conferences between the directors of .4 tins company and the directors of the South Sea, under the influence and interposition of some persons of the highest figure and station .

4 that- tfiey had made no agreement yet with tiie South Sea; hut that tiie directors bad -‘ thought fit to cotne to a resolution upon the matter.' Then the resolution was read; and, without any person’s speaking to it, was immediately formed into a question to this elfect:

' * That, for the better support of the public ‘ credit, the directors, of the bank of England ‘ be i in powered to agree with the directors of the South Sea, to circulate their bonds to what sum, and upon what tferms, and for what ‘ time, they shall think proper; and to make .

4 what other agreements with the South Sea,

I 4 they shall judge to be for the interest of this I 4 corporation:’ which question was instantly agreed to with great unanimity. Then the Governor Acquainted them, that he believed hooks would be ready for a subscription to he taken in, the next day, for.the purpose afore- ' said, and that it would be ou the usual terms, lol. per cent, deposit, and 3/. per cent, premium, and 51.per cent, interest, and then the court adjourned.

The Directors of the two Companies being thus empowered, a Committee of both met on the 23rd of September, and a Proposal was made by one of the directors of the South Sea Company, 4 That the 3, 700,000l. (which the South ‘ Sea Company was to repay to the Bank at Lady-Day, and Michaelmas 1721) should he subscribed by the Bank into the stock of the South Sea Company, for which the Bank was 4 to have such shares as the funds would produce, the stock being valued at 400/. per cent. ’

This Proposal was the next day reported at a court of the directors of the Bank; and, being agreed to, was the same day communicated, by a director of the Bank fo the court of directors of the South Sea Company.

This, in short, is the History of the fanrfous Bank Contract, which has made so. rauclj noise. The substance of all which is, that, in •»' the dav of distress, the Bank was thought the

only resource to support the sinking state of the South Sea Company. Every one that was thought capable of giving any assistance was called iu: at the first conference Mr.' yValpoie assisted, and the Bank was persuaded to undertake what was proposed to .them:the first part of the proposition, and, indeed, the original proposal for circulating the bonds, upon which the first conference was held, was dropped by the South Sea Company; and the last article of taking South Sea stock at 400/. per cent, was carried on and accepted by a committee of the Bank:and this example, it was hoped, by the managers of the South Sea affairs, would fix the price of South Sea stock at that rate: but they were soon convinced by the daily fall of the stock, that this expedient would not answer: and the Bank quickly found, they had been prevailed upon to consent to what they were not able to perform, as will presently be seen.

When the Books were opened at the Bank, for taking in a subscription for the support of public credit, the concourse of people, who readily brought in their money, w«s at first so very great, that it was judged the whole subscription, (which wasintended for three millions) would have been filled that very day: but it happened, that the fall of the Sooth Sea stock, and the discredit of that company’s bonds, occasioned a run upon the most eminent goldsmiths and bankers, some of whom having lent out great sums upon South Sea stock, and other public securities, were obliged to shut up their shops and abscond. The Sword Blade Company (who hitherto had been the chief cash-keepers of the South Sea Company) Being almost drained of their ready money, were forced to stop payment, and set up at their office written bills, giving notice, ‘ That

* they would pay any part of their notes in « South Sea stock at 400/. per cent, or pay

* part in cash on the Monday following, and (give five per cent, interest on the rest till

* paid; and that they would take their own

* notes in payment of the monies they had ‘ lent/ This, being looked upon as a kind of Bankruptcy, increased the public, calamity, and occasioned a great run upon the Bank, who were obliged to pay out money faster than they received it upon the subscription. But the festival of Michaelmas, on which the Bank was shut of course, gave it some breathing time.

In the mean time. Sooth Sea Stock continued sinking till Michaelmas-Day, when it was about 150, at which pricfe it was on the tnd of' February, the day after the House of Commons accepted the Proposals of the South Sea Company, whose low credit appeared yet more plainly, in that their bonds, payable on Michaelmas 1721, were now at above 25/. per cent, discount:

Pursuant to a former Resolution for relieving the last subscribers, a general court was held the 30th of September, wherein, after the agreement with the Bank was ratified, it was resolved that the proprietors of the redeemable debts, tqken

in on the last subscriptions, should be allowed, for their several interests in the funds, the same terms, in all respects, as the Bank; and that the last subscription of the Long Annuities should be valued at 32 years purchase; and of the Short at 47 years purchase ; * to be paid for in stock at 400 per cent, and be intitled to the last Midsummer dividend: And that all the Annuitants should be allowed the interest of their annuities to the 29th of September. It was also agreed, that the third subscription, which was taken at 1000 per cent, should be reduced to 400 per cent, and the subscription receipts given out accordingly. That the 100 per cent, already paid, should be taken in part of the payment; and that the remaining 300 per cent, should be paid in nine payments, whereof the three next payments to be at 40 per cent, each, and the other six payments at 30 per cent, at six months distance, from each other; the first payment of 40 per cent, to be die 2d of July 1721. It was also agreed, that the fourth subscription, which was taken at 1000 per cent, whereof 200 per cent, was paid down, should be also reduced to 400 per cent, and that the remaining 200 per cent, should be paid in eight equal payments of 25 per cent. ; each, the first of which was lo be the 26th of September, 1721, Rod the remaining payments, at six months distance from each other. That interest should be allowed to the company from Michaelmas, 1720, after the rate of 5 per cent, per ann. to the respective times of payment of the said third and fourth subscriptions: And that the 10 per cent, dividend at Midsummer, should be also allowed on the third and fourih subcriptions. That tha proprietors of the receipts of all the mouey subscriptions, should be allowed, in part of

their payments, the several, dividends that should be made on the stock of the company, till their payments were completed. That five per cent, interest be allowed on all the company’s bonds from the 99th instant till they should become due; and that any of the company's bonds should be taken as money in the fourth payment of the first subscription, which would Become due on the 14th October.

These Resolutions gave no satisfaction to the Annuitants, nor put the least stop to the fall of the South Sea Stock. The Bank finding they were not able to stem the tide, without exposing the properties of their own principals and ad* venturers to be carried away and lost in the common deluge, they wisely kept themselves out of the general inundation, and did not care to be drowned with those they could not save. They resolved to drop an agreement, which they were under no obligation to perforin (had it been possible) and to which the South Sea had no power to compel them. On the 10th of November, the governor of the Bank reported from the Committee, appointed to treat with the South Sea Company, that the transactions between the Bank and that Company had been laid before council, on behalf of the Bank; and that, the South Sea Company pressing for an answer of what had been done therein, the governor of the Bank had acquainted the deputy governor of the South Sea Company, that the Committee did npt think fit, for the present, to proceed further in that affair, and had delivered to him in writing the following Answer.

4 When the proposition was offered by the f lords, at the meeting of the Committees of both Companies, as a suitable expedient for the support of public credit, the court of directors of the Bank shewed their readiness to join in any measures, that might tend to the service of the public.

4 But, some difficulties appearing to the Committee of the Bank, they have consulted with their council, and they are advised, that

* considering the nature of this transaction, it will not be safe for them to proceed upon the proposition without consent of parliament. 4 However, they think it reasonable, that, in the mean time, the Committee of the South Sea should give the Committee of the Bank some account of their estate, for the satisfac- lion of their principals/

About a week after, the following paper was sent to the Bank from the Lords of the Treasury:4 My lords desire, that the difficulties which have arisen (and upon which, they say, they have consulted their own council)

* concerning the late agreement between them and the South Sea Company, may be put in writing, and delivered to their lordships, as soon as possible, > that their lordships may receive the opinion of the king’s council/

To this the following Answer was given: 4 The Court of Directors of the Bank have, 4 with the utmost deference, considered the. 4 meemgs in writing, which your lordships were

4 pleased to send them, and they humbly ap-‘ prehend, they cannot better explain them-

* selves, than they have already done, in the manner they have given to the South Sea Com-

* pany, acopy whereof was delivered to your lord *

4 ships, which contains the substance of what they consulted with their council thereupon/

Thai ended the transactions between the two Companies, which (as it has been suggested) were carried on by the authors and promoters of them, with a design to take ad* vantage of the first rumour of this supposed agreement, and draw in unwary persons, who desirous to retrieve their losses, were induced to buy stock at the price the - Bank had, agreed to take it. Those who had countenanced and Tun into every part of the South Sea Scheme, and were consequently deeply involved, were justly suspected of having contrived and taken advantage of the Contract, by which means great numbers of deluded people were undone.

Thus, in the space of eight months, were seen the rise, progress, and fall, of that mighty fabric, which, being'wound up by mysterious springs to a wonderful bright, had fixed the eyes and expectations of all Europe, but whose founds* tioubeing fraud, illusion, credulity and infatuation, fell to the ground, as soon as the artful management of the projectors was discovered* The ebb of this swoln fluctuating credit re* turned with greater violence than it flowed, and carried every tiling before it with that precipita-’tion, that the application of the ministers of state, and the directors of the great companies jointly and separately to stop it, were ineffectual*. Express after express was sent to Hanover, te* give the king information of the state of affairs^ which was so urgent, that the king set out for England sooner than he intended, and arrived at London the 11th of November.

The South Sea stock, which was 200 at the king’s arrival, fell again upon the prorogation of' the parliament, from the 25th of November to the 8th of December, to 135; but, on a report that the ministry had agreed with the principal directors of the South Sea, the Bank, and East India Company, upon a project which would very much conduce to the restoration of the public credit, it rose again to 210.

SIXTH SESSION of the FIFTH PARLIAMENT of GREAT BRITAIN.

The King's Speech at the Opening of the Scs~ sion, ] December 8. This day the King came to the House of Lords* when the Lord Chancellor, by his majesty’s command, read the following Speech to both Houses:

44 My Lords and Gentlemen,

44 Since we last parted, the face of our affairs abroad is become more favourable: the peace in the South only wants the form of a Congress, and that of the North is brought much nearer to a conclusion. I shall, at a proper time, order the several Treaties I have made to be laid before you; by which you will perceive the success of our endeavours to establish a peatee

67‘J] PARL. HISTORY, 7 Georgr J

throughout Europe, and to secure and support, the Pro’testant religion: at the same time, I can never sufficiently express my concern for the unhappy turn of affairs, which has so much, affected the Public Credit at home;

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons,

“ I do most earnestly recommend it to you, that you consider of the most effectual and speedy methods to restore the National Credit, and fix it upon a lasting foundation. You will, I doubt not; be assisted in so commendable and necessary a wprk, by every man that loves his country, and especially by the several great Societies of this kingdom. I hope you will, on this occasion remember, that all your prudence, your temper, and resolution, are necessary to find out and apply the proper remedies to our misfortunes: which will, if you succeed, serve to increase that reputation you have so justly acquired, particularly, if you-shall be able, notwithstanding these difficulties, to discharge ✓ a part of the Public Debt.

“ I have ordered the several Estimates to be laid before you of the expence of the ensuing year; apd must desire you-to dispatch the Supplies nedessary for them.

* . “ My Lords and Gentlemen,

u 1 am glad to observe to you, that our trade does appear to have been more extended this year than-in the preceding one; we have the most flourishing nayy of any nation whatsoever to protect it:-, and I hope you will turn your thoughts to the best methods for the security and enlarging of, our commerce. You may depend on ray hearty concurrence to’all such provisions, as sballappear to you necessary for the good of my people."

The Lords1 Address of Thanks.] The Lords immediately agreed to the following Address:

Most Gracious Sovereign, u We, your'majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled, beg leave to return your majesty the Thanks of this House, for your knost gracious Speed) from the throne; and to congratulate your majesty upon the near prospect of a general peace being established throughout Europe: and we do acknowledge, with the greatest gratitude; your majesty’s care and endeavours for the security and support of the Protestant religion; towards the attaining which .great ends, yuur majesty may depend upon our utmost support and assistance.

“ We cannot sufficiently express to your majesty hpw much we are concerned at the present unhappy state of Public Credit: and we do, lipon this occasion, assure youf majesty of our zealous and ready concurrence in all such methods as shall be most effectual and speedy to restore it, and fix it upon a lasting foundation; and also in all othejpneasures that may tend to the securing arid sfifilarging the commerce of »these kingdoms.’ *

The King’s Answer.] To this the King gave the following Answer;

. 1720. — Debate in theCotnmons [080

“ My Lords;

“ I thank you for this dutiful and loyal Ad- (dress; and I persuade myself, that your zeal lor the good of your country, your temper, wisdom, and unanimity, will greatly contribute towards extricating os out of our present difficulties/’- '

Debate in the Commons on the Motion for an Address.] The Commons being returned to their House,

Mr. Pulteney moved, “ That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, to return him the thanks of this House for his most gracious Speech from the throne; to express the satisfaction of his faithful Commons at the near prospect there is of peace being established throughout Europe ', by the success of his majesty’s endeavours; to acknowledge his-rnajesty’? great goodness in his tender concern for the misfortunes of his people, occasioned by the unhappy turn of affairs, that hath so much afi-feeted the Public Credit of this kingdom; to assure his majesty, that this House will, at this critical conjuncture, wherein his majesty’s government and the interest of his people are so highly concerned, proceed with all possible care, prudence, and temper, to inquire into the causes of these misfortunes, *

* “ Dec. 10. Upon Wednesday night, about a hundred members met at the Secretary’s office, when (according to custom) the king’s Speech was read, and a Resolution was proposed for an Address of Thanks. One of th<t company said, he thought the directors of the South Sea Company ought by name to be represented, as the persons to whom the loss of credit ought to be imputed, but condemning persons unheard (however obnoxious) was not reasonable; but that the end might be attained by general words, to wit, ‘ to enquire into the ‘ causes of these misfortunes.’ This was very vigorously opposed by some few, and a great man said it would, instead of retrieving, occasion (probably) an utter loss of it, for that the directors would run away; but this did not obtain. For my own part, I thought the words fully agreed to, when on a sudden it was whispered about, that they were omitted, which gave occasion to a friend of yours, to call to Mr. Secretary, who was reading a subsequent paragraph, to know whether the amendment proposed were inserted, to which he answered no; ‘for you know, ’ says he, *1 am to ob-‘ serve directions, and members calling out,

‘ read on, read on, I proceeded so to do, with-‘ out inserting them.* The other replied, ‘1

* thought the words agreed to, and consequent-*ly inserted, for surely half a dozen near you ‘ are not to think of determining for so'great a

* number: we meet here as I apprehend to en-‘ deavour so to understand each other, as to be ‘ of one mind in another place; 1 think it ‘ therefore incumbent on me to speak plainly.

‘ This resolution is to be proposed to the House,

‘ where the words you, have thought fit to omit.

GS1]

and apply the proper remedies for restoring and fixing Public Credit upon such solid and lasting foundations, as may effectually give ease and quiet to the minds of his majesty's subjects; and that this House will, with readiness and cheerfulness, grant ‘the Supplies necessary for the service of the ensuing year, and consider in what manner the Trade and Commerce of the nation may be best secured and extended."

Mr. Henry Pelham seconded this motion, but

Mr. Shippen offered a clause to be added after the words, for restoring and fixing Pub- lie Credit/ viz.4 as far as it is consistent with the honour of parliament, the interest of the nation, and 'the principles of justice.' Mr.

* may be offered, and I do promise you upon my word they will be so, when they will be fully debated, and if occasion be, the ques-

* tion determined by a division/ Mr. Secretary then said, propose your words, which being done, they were without more ado inserted.

“ The motion being yesterday made, gentlemen let themselves into the most bitter invectives against the mis-execution of the act of parliament, and indeed in great measure against the act, as vesting too large powers in a set of men who are now called miscreants, the scum of the people, and worse names'if possible. Thus are we ashamed of what many of us contended for last year with the greatest eagerness, and that upon motives not fit to be mentioned. The more moderate few (for that was what but very few had a right to call themselves) laid the stress upon mis-execution; but even upon this head, they went great lengths, particularly sir Joseph Jekyll, who said, that he could not but think, at least hope, that all the Directors w ere not equally culpable, but sure he was, that some were highly crituiual who werq not directors. .Another said, the ministry with only a frown had been able to put a stop to all the little Bubbles, in order to deepen the water for the great one, whence profit was to arise. A third concluded thus: This parliament begun with a Secret Committee falling upon a precedent ministry; and why may it not conclude with doing so to another? What your friend said Wednesday night, prftves to have been well judged, for upon reporting the address yesterday, sir J. J. moved an^ amendment, by inserting what you see therein, of punishing the authors, which went without opposition. Others took exception to it as' too tender; this pot being a party cause, arrows in full vollies are let fly from every quarter.

Coxe's Walpole. Correspondence: Mr. Thomas Brodrick to lord Chancellor Middleton.

Shippen’s reasons for this addition, were, That mi order effectually to remedy the present misfortunes, (meaning the fatal South Sea Scheme) it was absolutely necessary to maintain' the honour and faith of parliamentary engagements, and to shew the highest resentment against those, who, abusing the trust reposed in them, had given so fatal a wound to public credit, and enriched themselves by the plunder of the nation:that, in his opinion, the managers of the South Sea Project were not the most criminal, since there were those above’them, whose duty it was to overlook and direct their proceedings; and had those at the helm interposed in the affair of the South Sea, as they did in the case of other projects, they would have prevented that dismal calamity which has since befallen the nation.

Mr. Shippen was seconded by Mr. Bromley.

Sir William Wyndham said. That it would be a disgrace to a British House of Commons, to shew, on this occasion, less vigour and spirit than the parliament of Paris, then sitting at Pontoise: that that parliament was justly N

looked upon as the shadow of an English parliament; and yet that very parliament bad, by their firmness and resolution, carried their point so far, as to get that person removed from the administration, whom they looked upon as the author of the present misfortunes of France.

The Lord Molesworth? who spoke on the

* 44 Robert, viscount Molesworth, descended from an ancient family in Northamptonshire’, was born December 1656, in Dublin, where his father, who died before his birth, had settled as a merchant. He was educated at Dublin, and displayed so much zeal and patriotism at the Revolution, that James's Parliament sequestered his property. The victorious William, however, rewarded his fidelity, made him one of his privy counsellors, and sent hiuiashi* ambassador to Denmark. After a residence of three years Molesworth offended the Danish Court, by not sufficiently respecting the customs and the privileges of the country, and left the place abruptly, and on his return to England published An Account of Denmark.". The book, though well received and translated into several languages, offended prince George of Denmark, by representing the Danish government as tyrannical, and a memorial of complaint was presented to king’ William, and an answer prepared to it by Dr. King. But Molesworth disregarded these measures, safe in the public approbation and the friendship of Shaftesbury. He was member of the House of Commons in several parliaments, but rendered himself obnoxious to the clergy, by an affectation of popularity, and by profane insinuations that religion is a pious craft, an useful state en- . gine, but far inferior to the principles which, in the school of Athens and Rome, incited their attentive youth to the love of their epunrry, and to the practice*of the moral virtues. As he strongly supported the Hanoverian succes-

same side, run over the king’s Speech from the throne, and said. He was glad they were told, that the peace in the Squth only wanted the fortn of a Congress, which gave him liopes, that the difficulties started by Spain, in relation to Gibraltar, were, at last, surmounted, and that we were like to preserve that important conquest of the preceding war, together with Port Mahon, which would make us some amends for the great expence of blood and treasure we had lately been at, to conquer Sicily for the House of Austria. And speaking of the South Sea calamity, he said, That before they considered of the proper remedies, they ought to enquire into the cause and nature of the distemper: that it is with the body politic, as with the body natural; and therefore they ought to imitate skilful surgeons, who, iu order to cure a wound, begin with probing it, and, when they find it necessary, make incisions and scarifications to get the venomous core out of it, before they apply healing plais-ters; and that they who follow a contrary method are but mere empirics, who, by using palliatives, make the sore rankle and fester, and endanger the life of the patient. He owned it bad been by some suggested, that there was no law to punish the Directors of the South Sea Company, who were justly looked upon as the immediate authors of the present misfortunes: but that, in his opinion, they ought, on this occasion, to follow the example of the ancient Romans, who having no law against parricide, because their legislators supposed no son could be so unnaturally wicked, as to embrue his hands in his father’s blood, made one to punish so heinous a crime, as soon as it happened to be committed; and adjudged the guilty wretch to be thrown alive, sewed up in a sack, into the Tyber. Concluding, That as he looked upon the contrivers -and executers of the villainous South Sea Scheme, as the parricides of their country, be should be satisfied to see them undergo the name punishment.

Sir Joseph Jekyll said, That as he doubted not but among the South Sea Directors some might be inaocent, and others criminal; so he was of opinion, there were those, who were not Directors, no less, if not more criminal, than the Directors themselves; and who therefore deserved an equal, if not a severer punishment. Adding, That upon extraordinary emergencies, where the laws are deficient, the legislative authority may and ought to exert itself; and be hoped a British parlia-liatnent would never want a vindictive power to punish national crimes.

members, spoke also for the clause offered by Mr. Shippen:but, on the other hand, it was represented by Mr. Craggs, Mr. Philip Yorke, and Mr. Robert Walpole, That such a restriction did but ill suit with an Address of Thanks; which, in their opinion, ought to ran in the usual form, and answer, in general terras, the several heads of the Speech from the throne: that as to the main drift of that clause, they thought it inconsistent with the rules of prudence, to begin this session with irritating inquiries: that if the city of London were on fire, they did not doubt but all wise men would be for extinguishing the flames, and preventing the spreading of the conflagration, before they inquired into the incendiaries» that in like manner. Public Credit having received a most dangerous wound, and being still in a bleeding condition, they ought to apply a speedy remedy to it; and that afterwards they might inquire into the cause of the present calamity. Mr. Walpole declared. That he had never approved the South Sea Scheme, and was sensible it had done a great deal of mischief: but since it could not be undone, be thought it the duty of all good men to give their helping hand towards retrieving it: and that with this view, he had already bestowed some thoughts on a Proposal to restore Public Credit, which, at a proper time, he would submit to the wisdom of that House.

Hereupon, the question being put for inserting the clause before-mentioned, it passed in the negative, by 261 against 103.

Dec. 9. Upon the Report of the Address of Thanks, a motion being made by Mr. Milner, member for Minehead, for inserting the words,

The Commons’ Address of Tfomfa.] Dec. 10. The Commons, with their Speaker, waited on his Majesty with the abovementioned Address, which is as follows:

Most Gracious Sovereign,

“We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, beg leave to return your majesty our most dutiful and hearty Thanks for your most gracious Speech from the throne.

“ We can never sufficiently express our gratitude to your majesty, for your constant' care of the true interest of your subjects, nor the satisfaction of your faithful Commons, ia seeing that the just influence of your majesty’s councils abroad, has procured so near a prospect of a general peace throughout Europe: which is a fresh instance to them, that your majesty places your greatness only in the prosperity and happiness, of your people.

“ If any thing could more effectually endear your majesty to us than the mildness of your government, it would be that tender and affectionate concern you express for the present misfortunes of your people, occasioaed by the

unhappy tarn of affairs, that hath so much affected the public credit of this kingdom.

u But your faithful Commons are met together with minds fully, disposed to take the most just an defies tual methods, and to do every thing that becomes an affectionate parliament, at this critical conjuncture, >vherein your majesty^ government, and the interest of your people, are so highly concerned, to restore and fix the credit of this nation upon such split! and lasting foundation, as may effectually give ease and quiet to the minds of your majesty’s subjects; and we flatter ourselves, that our undertaking will be the more easy, since we are determined to proceed with all possible prudence, temper, and resolution, to inquire into the causes of our present misfortunes; and with the maturest deliberation, apply ourselves to And out the most proper measures for redressing them, and for punishing the authors of them.

“ The improvement of our Trade is of so public a concern, and so necessary for the support and power of this kingdom, that we will employ our utmost endeavours .to consider in what manner the commerce of the nation may be best secured and extended.

“ And we beg leave to asstlre your majesty, that we will, with all cheerfulness and unanimity, grant the Supplies which shall be necessary for the service of the ensuing year, and the support of your government, upon which the happiness of the nation, the liberty of your subjects and the security of our religion so Entirely depend.”

The King's Answer.] To which the King returned the following Answer:

“Gentlemen;

“ I return you my hearty Thanks for this Address; and as I depend on your applying a speedy remedy to the present distress, I am persuaded you will take the most prudent measures to make it effectual.”

Debate on ordering the South Sea Company to lay an Account of their Proceedings before the Commons.] Dec. 12. The Commons in a

grand committee, considered of the motion to grant a Supply to his majesty, which was unanimously agreed to. After this, Mr. Grey Neville moved, “ That the Directors of the-South Sea Company should forthwith lay before the House an Account of their Proceedings:” He was seconded by Mr. Pitt, and backed by lord Molesworth. The courtiers being surprised at this unexpected motion,

Mr. Craggs thereupon endeavoured to shew, That it was preposterous; and that the House having already appointed a day to resolve into a grand committee, to consider of the present State of the Public Credit of this kingdom, the same would naturally bring on the inquiry into the conduct of the South-Sea Directors. Mr. Craggs was seconded by lord Hinchinbroke and by

Mr. Horatio Walpole, who owned indeed, That the South-Sea Scheme was weak in its

projection, villainous in its evocation, and calamitous in its end; but that, in his opinion, they ought to begin with applying a remedy, to the evil.

Mr. Robert Walpole added, That as he had already declared, hie had spent some time upon a Proposal for that purpose; but was apprehensive, that if they weat on in a warm, passionate way, the said scheme might be rendered altogether impracticable; therefore he desired that the House would proceed regularly and calmly, lest by running precipitately into odious inquiries, they should exasperate the distemper to such a degree, as to render all remedies ineffectual.

Sir JosephJekytl on the other hand, set forth

the necessity of examining, without the least delay, into the conduct of the South-Sea Company; to see whether they bad made good their engagements, and strictly followed the rules prescribed to them by the act passed last session of parliament in their favour; urging, That this was the most natural way of proceeding in an affair of so great importance:that on the contrary, it seemed absurd to attempt the cure of a distemper before they were acquainted with it: but that as soon as it was thoroughly discovered, he hoped that wise assembly should not want Schemes to apply proper remedies to it.

Mr. Gilford Lawson having supported Mr. Neville's motion, the courtiers thought fit no longer to oppose it; so that the same was .agreed to without a division *, and it was accordingly ordered,

* “Dec. 18. The motion of Saturday (which ^mentioned in my last,) was yesterday put into better form, as you will see by the votes s *the first question moved, was in very strong terms opposed by three or four; for as I remember, that was the number. On the other fodnd, numbers spoke with the freedom becoming a. British House of Commons. The first who spoke on the side of the question, was my quondam colleague (sir Richard Steele) he indeed set the matter in a clear light, by telling us, that a nation of more wealth and greater \ credit than any in Europe, within less than two years, was reduced to what we see, and too sensibly feel, by a few cyphering cits, a species of men of equal capacity in all respects (that of cheating a deluded people only ex- cepted) with those animals who sdved the capitol, who were now to be screened by those of greater figure, for what reason they best know, others were at liberty to judge. Ano* ther (in answer to an argument against the question, that this vindictive justice so much contended for, would not attain the end proposed, for that you would not be able to come at the estates of the delinquents) said he thought all the laws against bankrupts being enacted into one against the Directors (for so he would always call them, as what carri&d more of obloquy than any other word could express) would, in his opinion, attain' the end pro-

by the House, and was seconded by sir Joseph Jekyll:but sir Theodore Janssen, member for Yarmouth, and one of the South Sea Directors, having-assured them, that the next day part of the Papers called for would be laid before them, the House acquiesced.

The' said Accounts presented to the House.] *Dec. 15. The Sub-Governor and Deputy-Governor of the South Sea Company presen fed to the House several Papers, with a Schedule of them, which was read. Hereupon it was ordered, “ That the said Papers be referred to the Committee of the whole House, who were to take into consideration the present State of the Public Credit of this kingdom.” Then the House resolved itself into the said Committee; and after the reading of those Papers, which lasted untill about four in the afternoon, Mr. Sloper, Mr. Plummer, Mr. Milner, sir Richard Steele, and Mr. Lawson, made several exception's to the conductof the South Sea Directors; and, in particular, to their lending out vast sums of money belonging to the Company, .without being duly authorised for that purpose:but a6 the Committee could not regularly proceed in that matter without exact Accounts of these Loans, the farther consideration of the present State of the Public Credit was adjourned to the 19th; and, in the mean time it was ordered, that the Directors of the South Sea Company should lay before the House several Papers relating to that affair.

Resolutions on the Supply.] Dec. 19. Mr. Farrer reported to the House the Resolutions of the grand Committee on the Supply, viz.

“ 1. That 10,000 men be allowed for the service of the year 1721, beginning from the 1st day of January 1721. 2. That 4/. per man

per month be allowed for maintaining the said

10,000 men for 13 months, including the ordnance for sea-service. 3. That 219, 019/. 14#. be granted for the ordinary of the navy for the year 1721, including half-pay to sea-officers.

4. That 50, 200/. be granted for extra-repairs of the navy for the year 1721. 5.

Land-Forces, now on foot, might well be spared, and the saving sum applied towards repairing the public calamity; and therefore be moved, That the said 5th Resolution be re-committed.

He was hacked by Mr. Bromley, sir William Wyndham and Mr. Hungerford; but was op-

Sosed by Mr. Robert Walpole, and his brother lr. Smith and some other gentlemen, who endeavoured to shew, That the number of our forces was so moderate, that it could hardly be lessened, even although a general peace were concluded, without exposing the nation either to foreign insults, or to domestic factions; and therefore it were highly imprudent to, make any reduction in the army before the conclusion of the peace: that on the other hand, the sum that might be saved by disbanding 3 or 4000 'men was very inconsiderable, and ought not to cdme in competition with the advantage of being in a posture of defence: Since nothing contributes more to the public credit of a free nation, than the being in a condition not to fear any thing, either at home or abroad.

The question being put upon Mr. Shippers motion, it passed in the negative, without dividing.

Debate in the Commons on the Stale of the Public Credit.] The Commons being in a grand

Committee to take'into farther consideration the present State of the Public Credit of the kingdom,

Sir Joseph Jekyll moved, That a select

committee be appointed to inquire into all the Proceedings relating to the Execution of the South-Sea-Act, and was secouded by Mr. Gil-frid Lawson. But

Mr. Robert Walpole, having represented, That the proceeding.’in that manner would take up a great deal of time, and that the public credit being in a bleeding condition, they ought to apply a speedy remedy to it; that motion -was not insisted on. After this

Mr. Sloper shewed, That the present ca-

lamity was mainly owing to the vile arts of Stock-Jobbers, whereby^ the public funds were wound up far above their real value.

Which being readily assented to, the Committee came to this Resolution, viz. “ That nothing can tend. more to the establishment of Public Credit, than preventing the infamous practice of Stock-Jobbing.” Then,

Mr. Robert. Walpole acquainted the Com-

mittee, That as he had hinted some days before, he had spent sometime upon a Scheme for restoring Public Credit; but that the execution of it depending upon a position, which had been laid down as a fundamental, be thought it proper, before he opened the said scheme, to be informed, whether he might rely on that main foundation, viz. Whether the subscriptions of public debts and incumbrances, money subscriptions, and other contracts made with the South-Sea Company, should remain in the present state?

This question being stated, occasioned a

Vol. VII. I

warm debate, tohtch lasted till near eight in the evening, when it was at last resolved by 259 voices against 117, ‘‘ That all the subscriptions of public Debts and iucumbrances, and other contracts made with the South-Sea Company, by virtue of an act made last session, remain in the present state, unless altered for ' the ease and relief of the proprietors by a ’General Court of the South-Sea Company, or set aside by due course of law.

Dec. 20. Mr. Farrer reported the Resolution of the grand Committee on Public Credit; which with some amendments, was agreed to by the House, viz. u That it will very much contribute towards the establishing public credit, to prevent the infamous practice of Stockjobbing and a Bill was ordered to be brought

in thereupon *

Then a motion being made, That the House do agree with the Committee in the second Resolution, there arose a very warm debate, that lasted from three o'clock till half an hour past six in the evening.

• Mr. Robert Walpolet who, with his usual eloquence, spoke for the motion, set forth the views with which the South-Sea act was made; to wit, to consult the landed and trading interest of the nation, by lessening its incumbrances and public debts, and putting them in a method of being paid off in a few years; which could not have been done, unless a way had been found to make the Annuities for long terms redeemable; which had been happily effected by the South-Sea Scheme, without a breach of parliamentary faith; and if they should now unravel what had been done, they should not only rain the South-Sea Company, but instead of alleviating, aggravate the present misfortunes. In answer to this.

Sir Joseph Jekyll urged, That in order to remedy the present distemper, and restore public credit, they ought, in the first place, to resolve and assert public faith, equity, and justice, which the South-Sea managers had notoriously violated, with respect to the first and second subscribers of annuities and other public debts: For the former had not the stock, to which they were intitled, delivered to them, till six months after they had subscribed their effects, and when the stock was fallen above half in its price; and the latter had not the option either to accept or reject the terms that were offered them.

Mr.. Walpole having, among other things, replied, That if any injustice was done to the subscribers, they were, by the Resolution in question, left at liberty to seek their relief by law:

Mr. Lechmere, chancellor of the duchy, an-

swered him, and insisted, That if the South-Sea company, whom the parliament bad appointed trustees for the public debts, had not duly executed drat trust, in relation to the annuitant ^, the latter could seek for relief no where but iu parliament, and that it was a duty incumbent on the legislature to relievo them.

Mr. R. Walpole presents his Scheme to the

House, J’or restoring Fublic .] Dec. 21.

Mr. Lowndes presented to the Commons several Accounts und Estimates; alter which, the House resolved itself into a grand Committee on the Supply, and came to several Resolutions thereupon. *Theu the members in VVest-miuater-hall, court of requests, and places adjacent, having been summoned to attend, the House resolved itself into a grand Committee, and Mr. Robert Walpole laid before them a new Scheme to restore Public Credit, which was, in substance, to ingraft nine millions of South-Sea stock into, the Bunk of England,

* “ Having thus gradually smoothed his way, and obtained the avowal of the Commons, that the subscriptions of the proprietors of the debt should be considered as valid, Walpole brought forward his scheme; it was, in substance, to engraft nine millions of stock into the Bank of England, and the same sum into the East India company, on certain conditions; the remaining twenty millions were to be left to the South Sea Company. In his speech, recommending this plan, Walpole studiously avoided the introduction of any speculative topics, or any assertions which were not proved by papers before the House; He promised, and frequently repeated, that he founded his calculations on the veracity of those statements, and by his prudence in that respect, silenced many cavils which must necessarily have arisen from assertions less closely connected with obvious and attainable proof. After a few objections, made by Hutcheson, and some other members, it was-ordered, -that proposals should be received from the Bank of England, and the East India Company, for restoring public credit. It met however with a warm, but fruitless opposition from the three companies, because neither derived from it any peculiar advantage; their proposals were presented to the House, and a bill framed accordingly. In its passage through the Commons, it was in some respects altered and. amended; but the principal features went preserved. The chief management of the business was committed to Walpole, and though it was violently opposed in its. progress, yet his prudence and discretion either gave way to the general clamour, or submitted to various amendments, er his weight and eloquence, aided by the influence of government, obtained a majority in its favour: it passed the House of Lords, and received the royal assent.” Coxe’s Walr pole.

Mr. Hutcheson, and other members, made some exceptions to that Scheme, but none offering a better remedy for the present misfortunes, Mr. Farrer, the chairman, was directed to move the House, and it was accordingly ordered, “ That the said Committee have power to receive Proposal* from the Bank of England, the South-Sea Company, and the East-India Company, towards restoring Public Credit.”

The Lords appoint a Day to consider the Start of the jVafifm.] On the 13th of December, die duke of Wharton took notice of the present calamitous State of the Nation, occasioned by the South-Sea Project, and gave several instances of the unfair management of the Directors; and ' moved that a day might be appointed to consider of the present State of the Nation. Dec. 20th was accordingly appointed.

Dec. 20. The Lord North and Grey stood up, and animadverted on some licentious and prophane writings, that struck at the very foundation of the Christian Religion. His lordship then took notice of the South-Sea Projeet, which, as he bad foretold eight months before, [p. 64d] had been attended with such dismal consequences. He was seconded by the earl of Aylesford.

The Duke of Wharton spoke on the same subject, and among other fraudulent practices of the South-Sea managers, instanced in soipe collusory bargains about stock, between the Sword-Blade Company and Mr. Knight, treasurer of the South-Sea Company, concluding, He hoped that' noble assembly would exert their power in punishing the villainous projectors and executers of the Sortth-Sea Scheme. Then the consideration of the State of the Public Credit, wart-eferred to a Committee of the whole House.

Dec. 21. The House ordered'the several Accounts relating to the South-Sea Company to be laid before the House; and adjourned to the 9th day of January.

Debate in the Commons on the Mutiny January 4, 1721. Mr. Treby moved for bringing in a Bill, ‘ To prevent Mutiny and Desertion, ’ &c. and was seconded by the lord Can-penter. Hereupon,

Sir Joseph Jckyll said, He could not but be surprised to see a bill moved for so early, which seldom or never used to be brought in until towards the end of a session: that 6ueh a hurry-seemed to be intended to stop the prosecution: of the authors of the present misfortunes:that they all very well knew that their days weres numbered, and that as soon as they bad dispatched the money bills and the bill now moved for, they should immediately be dispatched home: that therefore he . was for staying those; bills, until they had done justice to the nation, who called aloud for it.

Mr. Craggs said thereupon, He wondered to see any opposition made to a bill so necessary

for the safety ©t the government, especially by a person who had received signal favours from the crown. Upon this

Lord Moleswoi'th stood up, and said, Mr. Speaker, Is it come to this, th.t every man who has a place must do all the drudgery that is enjoined him ? This may be true of some underlings; but I don’t believe it, I am sure it is false, of king George: he commands his servants nothing, but what is according to the laws, and for the good of his subjects. Then Sir Joseph Jekyll added, That he was as eealous as any man for the service of the king and his government: but be *as of opinion, that the doing justice to the nation, and punishing those who had brought it into the present calamitous condition, was the most effectual way both to serve the king, and at the name time to discharge their duty to their injured country concluding, however, that he did not oppose the bringing in of the Bill in uestion, which was thereupon ordered to be rought in.

Sir Joseph Jekyll resuming his Speech, represented, That before they proceeded any farther, they ought to secure the Persons and Estates of those they had reason to look upon as the Authors of the public misfortunes; and therefore he moved, “ That leave be given to bring in a Bill to restrain the sub-governor, deputy-governor, directors, treasurer, under-: rea-KBurer, cashier, secretary, and accountant of the South-Sea Company, from going out of this kingdom for the space of one year, and until the end of the next session of parliament; and for discovering their estates and effects, and for preventing the transporting or alienating the same.'" He was seconded by

Mr. Horatio Walpole, who gave some instances both of the unfair methods by which «the South-Sea Directors, and their officers, had got immense riches, and of their pride and insolence.

' Serjeant Pengelly, sir Robert Raymond, sir Philip Yorke, Mr. Spencer Cowper, and Mr. Jefferies, having likewise supported sir Joseph Jekyll’s motion, it was carried nem. con. and ordered, That the said Bill be brought in accordingly. Upon this

Mr. Shippen expressed his great satisfaction, to see a British House of Commons resume their pristine vigour and spirit, and act with so great unanimity for the public good. He owned the necessity of securing the persons and estates of the South-Sea Directors, and their officers: but said, That, in his opinion, there were Some men in great stations, whom, in time, he would not be afraid to name, who were no less guilty than the Directors.

Mr. Craggs being somewhat nett led, at this, said, That he was ready to give satisfaction to any man that should question him, either in that House or out of it. This expression gave no-small offence; and thereupon the

Lord Molesworth replied* That lie had the honour to be a member of that House upwards of thirty years, and never before now knew any man bold enough to challenge the whole House of Commons, and all England besides: That for his part, though past sixty^ he would answer whatever Mr. Craggs had to say within the House, and hoped there were young members enough, that would not be afraid to look him in the face out of the House. Upon this

Mr. Craggs Seeing the House in a great ferment, got up again, and said, That by giving satisfaction, he meant clearing his conduct.

A Committee of Secrecy appointed to inquire into the Proceedings of Directors.] As soon as this was over, the House debated in what manner they should proceed in the intended Inquiry, whether in a Grand ora Select Committee. After long disputes on both sides, it was resolved, nem. con. “ That tr Committee of thirteen, to be chosen by ballotting, be appointed to inquire into all the Proceedings relating to the Execution of the South-Sea Act.” This done, the lord Hinch-ingbroke represented:That it was to he feared, that before the Bill ordered to be brought in against the sub-governor, deputy-governor, and directors of the South-Sea Company, was gone through both Houses, the most criminal amongst them might withdraw themselves out of the kingdom; and therefore hi^ lordship moved, that they might be immediately ordered into custody: But Mr. Lechmere, having shewed the inconveniences that might ensue thereupon, that motion was dropr. — Accordingly* on the 11th, serjeant Mead reported the Names of the Committee appointed to inquire into all the Proceedings relating to the Execution of the South-Sea Act, viz. Mr, Thomas Broderick, Mr. Hutcheson, sir Joseph JekvN, Mr. Wortley, sir Thpmas Pengelly, Mr. William Clayton, Mr. Jefferies, lord Moles worth, col. Strangeways, Mr. Sloper, Mr. Lechmere, general Ross, and hon. Mr. Dixie Windsor. These persons, or any five of them, were to report their proceedings from time to time to the House, and. to have power to send for persons, papers, and records; and the several Books and Papers which had been laid before the House by the South-Sea Company, were referred to the said Committee.

The Commons take into Consideration the Proposals from the South-Sea Company, for ingrafting nine Millions of their Stock into the

East-India Company, and nine more into the Bank.] Jan. 5. In a grand Committee, the Commons took Into consideration the Proposals laid before the said Committee by the South-Sea Company, for ingrafting nine millions of their stock into the East-India Company, and the like, sum into the Bank of Eng-

land, as also the Proposals of the EaSt-India Company and the Bank, for taking in the said Stock, and after some debate, it was resolved, by 173 voices against 130, that an Ingraftment of part of the capital of the South-Sea Company into the capitals Of the Bank of England and the East-India Company, pursuant to the several Proposals of the said Companies, will contribute very much to the restoring and establishing public credit. Mr. Speaker having resumed the Chair, the Court Parly moved, that Mr. Farrer, the chairman of the grand Committee, should the nett day report the said Resolution j but this motion was strenuously opposed, and the question beiDg put thereupon, it passed in the negative by a majority of 153 ' votes against 140; after which it was ordered, that the said Report he received on the 10th.

Jan. 10. The Sub-Governor of the South-Sea Company presented to /the House several States and Accounts that had been called for, and then air Joseph Jekyll presented to the House a Bill,

* To restrain the Sub-Governor, Deputy-Go-‘ vernor, Directors, Treasurers, &c. of the

* South-Sea Company, from going out of this

* kingdom/ &c. which was read the first, and ordered to be read a second time the next morning. After this, Mr. Farrer reported from the Committee of the whole House, the Resolution above-mentioned, about the Ingraftment of nine Millions of South-Sea Stock, upon the respective Stocks of the Bank and East-India Company; and amotion being made

* that the said Resolution be re-committed, it occasioned a warm debate, that lasted five hours. Mr. Sloper, Mr. Clayton, sir Joseph Jekyll, and

• some others, represented, That the project before them was more like to prove a dangerous palliative, than an effectual remedy to the present distemper; and being founded on injustice, would rather farther hurt than restore public credit. Mr. Hutcheson urged. That this scheme seemed to be calculated with the same view as the former, the ill effects of which they intended to remedy, and raised several other objections to the new Scheme, and insinuated, that if the Resolution in question were recommitted, he might propose Something better for the restoring of public credit. Mr. Robert Walpole answered all objections, and being strongly supported by Mr. Craggs, sir Robert Raymond, sir Philip Yorke, and by several other members; the question was put upon the radtion for re-

' committing the Resolution about the Ingraftment, which was carried in the negative, by E67 voices against 134. Then the House agreed to the said Resolution, and a Bill was ordered jto be brought in thereupon. *

* “ During the period in which this scheme was' carrying through both Houses of Parliament, the loudest and most violent clamours were excited as well against the directors, as against the ministers, who had promoted the, South-Sea act, which was considered as /he sole cause of the national distress.

pany was forgotten; and the frenzy of stock-jobbing was not taken into consideration. All the managers were indiscriminately involved in the same guilt; the very name of a director was synonymous with every species of fraud and villainy. Petitions from counties, cities, and boroughs, in all parts of the kingdom, were presented to the House, crying for justice due to an injured nation against the villainy of these peculators, and the sufferers looked up for indemnification from the confiscation of their property, or for vengeance in the punishment of their guilt. All those, who'like Walpole opposed extreme severity and indiscriminate punishment, were exposed to repeated insults aryl virulent invectives; . they were devoted, both in anonymous letters and public writings, to the speedy vengeance of a much injured people."

Debate in the Lords on the State of the Public Credit.] January 9. The Lords .being met, pursuant to adjournment, the Sub-Governor and Deputy-Governor of the South Sea Company laid before them several of the Papers called for; and the next day their lordships went into a grand Committee to consider of the State of the Nation, with relation to Public Credit.

. The Lord Stanhope said, “ That the Estates of the criminals, whether Directors or not Directors, ought to be confiscated to make good the public losses.”

. Lord Carteret spoke to the same effect.

The Earl of. Sunderland owned, that he bad been for the South Sea Scheme, because he thought it calculated for the advantage of the nation, in order to lessen the Public Debts, and in particular to fake off the heavy incumbrance of Long Annuities; that no man couldiroagine that so good a design could have been so perverted in the execution, as to produce quite contrary effects; but that, in his opinion, no act of parliament had ever been so much abused as the South Sea Act, and therefore he would go as far as any body to punish the offenders.

The Duke of Wharton said, with becoming vehemence, “ That they ought to have no respect of persons; that for his part he would give up the best friend lie had; that the nation had been plundered in a most flagrant and notorious manner, and therefore they ought to find out the offenders, and then punish them with the utmost severity.”

The Lord North and Grey and the earl of Abingdon urged also the ill effects of the South Sea Project, which the bishop of Rochester justly compared to a pestilence.

that therefore the case was no more or other then committing or requiring bail from a criminal uppon confession, according to the nature of the offence; that from the notoriety of the thing, as well as from the national prejudice sustained thereby, the legislature were now doing what in ordinary cases the magistrate might and ought to doe. The House were, from q coolenesse of temper, wrought up to a great heighth, and that (in my opinion) by the earnestness of some gentlemen, whoe att last were forct quietly to give up the point. I have seen strange tilrnes, but I thinke this matter incapable of one: what a considerable man be-, gan his first speech with (for hee spoake with great vehemence a second time) is certainly true, that saying any thing which might bee interpreted as favouring' a South Sea Director, would be very ill beard, and putt the speaker under great disadvantage. I will nott goe abroad (being a good deal feavourish) till I . thinke I can doe itt without great hazard, though I own I shall be very uneasy till I can attend ray doty.

“The Bill is ordered to the Lords. That House have had several brokers before them this day; a gentleman is just gone from mee (the Lords bung sitting late as it is) to lett me know

\

The Earl Cooper spoke likewise on the same ' side, and blamed those who, by the act of par* liament, were appointed to overlook and check the South Sea Directors; and who, in discharge of that trust, ought to haye prevented their, jumping from a subscription at 400 to 1000, which was the main cause of the misfortunes that ensued.

The Earl of Sunderland finding himself, and the other lords of the Treasury, thus attacked, spoke in his own and their vindication; and said, “ That by the South Sea Act they were directed to appoint such persons, as they should think fit, to be managers on the part of the Treasury, for the due execution of the said Act; that as they had reason to look upon those persons, who had the principal share in framing this Scheme, as the most able and proper to execute it, they had accordingly appointed some of the South-Sea directors to be managers and directors for the Treasury: concluding, that in this they had followed former precedents.”

The 'Lords resolve, That the Commissioners of the Treasury appointing the Directors of the South-Sea Company to be managers for executing theSouth-SeaAct t ous legal.]Hereupon the ques-

tion was proposed, “ That the Constitution from the Commissioners of the Treasury, dated the6tb of May, 1720, appointing the Directors of the’South-Sea Company to be managers and directors for performing such matters and things as, by the Act for enabling the said Company to increase their present capital Stock, are directed, has been conformable to precedents, and legal.” This occasioned a great debate, but the lord Harcourt having declared his opinion for the affirmative, the question was carried by 63 voices against 28. I

that those sparkes have confessed so much, that their lordships thiuke they will scamper, uuless taken into custody, with a Declaration and Message sent to the House ofCommobs, acquainting them here with; and that when and as often as the Committee shall send for them, their officer shall attend with them; desiring to know my opinion, whither the House (whom they would avoyd in any wise disoblidging) may looke uppon this as thq least obstruction to tho enquiry. My answer was, that I could enely speake as a private roan, and as such, did freely own my thoughts, that this proceeding, thus circumstantiated, could nptt bee thought in any sort an obstruction to our enquiry. That I knew the Committee had, in several instances, avoided doing things which possibly might administer cause to people without doors to hope for disputes between the Houses, nothing being more in their desire then avoiding such. . That

I verily believed, the House were of the same mind. For which reasons (though I desired itt 'might bee remembered, I tooke uppon mee to speake onelyas a private man) I was of opinion, noe exception would bee taken to this proceeding.” — Coxe’s Walpole.

Protest against the said Resolution."] Jan.

10. The Report from the above Committee being read, it was resolved, That the House do agree with the Committee in the above Resolution.

“ Dissentient."

4i 1. Because the Act of the last session of parliament for enabling the Soulh-Sea Company to increase their capital stock (upon which act the legality of the Constitution in question must wholly depend) hath vested the Directors and managers, to be appointed by the Commissioners of the Treasury, with such trusts and powers, and required such things to be done by them, as, we conceive, could not be ihtrusted to the Directors of the South-Sea Company to execute, according to the true intent and meaning of the said Aet.

w 2. Because we conceive it to be inconsis-

tent with the said Act, that the Directors and Managers appointed by the Commissioners of the Treasury (who by the Act are intrusted to ascertain what Annuities shall be tak^en in, and what debts paid off by the said Company; what additions, in respect thereof, shall be made to the capital stock of the said Company; how much is to be paid by the said Company into the Exchequer for the use of the public; what new allowance is to be made to the same corporation for charges of management; to enter iuto books the prices to be agreed on between the Company on the one part, and the proprietors of the Public Debts on the other part; to adjust the accounts of the Debts and Annuities taken in by the Company; and to certify and transmit duplicates of the accounts so adjusted, among others, to the Directors of the South-Sea Company) should be the Directors of the South-Sea Company, and they only.

u 3. Because the said Directors of the Company appear to us plainly to be concerned in interest, so as to incline them to execute the said powers or"trusts partially for the Company, unless restrained by a great degree of honesty; and if there should be any mistake by them committed, wiifully or otherwise, to the advantage of the Company and disadvantage of the said proprietors, in any matters intrusted to the said Directors and Managers, we do not find any provision in the said act to rectify the same, nor conceive how it can be tjone, unless by application to, and by consent of the said Directors and Managers, who are the Directors of the South Sea Company, and no other, which, we think, could never be the meaning of the act, but that the intent thereof must be, that the said trusts of Directors and Managers should have been executed by impartial and indifferent persons.

u 4. We conceive, that the said act expressly requires the commissioners of the treasury, to appoint fit persons to be Directors and Managers fot* executing the powers and trusts above specified; and therefore, if the above-mentioned reasons did not sufficiently prove the Con--Aatution in question not to^be agreeable to the >iid act, yet it seems very clear to us, that the

Directors of the Soath Sea Company were, of all others, the most unfit for such a trust, and consequently not sach persons as are expressfy required by the said act.

“ And we cannot agree, that the Baid Constitution is precedented.

* ' 1. Because the precedents produced are att in time before the passing the act of parliament, on which the present question did arise; and therefore, in out opinion, can be of no weight in determining any question that depended on the construction of the said act, unless such precedents bad been founded on some former act or acts of parliament, the -same, in all material points, with the act abovementioned; which it appears to us, neither the said Charter, nor Commissions or Appointments produced as precedents were.

“ 2. All the cases relied on as precedents (except the last) are, as we conceive, widely differing from the case in question; that marked No. 1. is dated before the erection of the South Sea Company, and therefore did not, nor could confer any powers on the Directors of the Company, which was not then in being, but is directed to the members of other corporations, divers great officers, and very many otbef persons, in order to the erecting the South Sea Company; the five following from No.

2 to No. 6, included, are indeed to impower the Directors of the South Sea Company, but it is only to take subscriptions of tallies, orders, debentures, and the like government securities, and to compute the interest due thereon, in order to the admitting the proprietor into the company at the rates stated in the acts of parliament, to which the charter and commissions relate; but none of them impower the Directors of the South Sea Company, to enter, adjust, or certify, or to do any matter relating to contracts to be made, whereto the company was to be made a party, as in the present case.

“ 3. And as to the said last case, cited as a precedent, marked No. 7, which comes the nearest to the present, the Directors of the South Sea Company being thereby appointed Directors and Managers (which they are not by any of the former) to execute all the powers given to Directors and Managers by the act of the fifth of his present majesty, for redeeming the fund appropriated- for the payment of the lottery tickets, yet neither by that appointment, or the act referred to, had the Directors of the South Sea Company any authority to do any thing in relation to contracts or bargains to be made, wherein the company .was to be made a party; ami therefore not to be compared in the present case.

“ 4. But if the said last and only precedent, not before taken notice of, had been a precedent in point, yet it bearing date no longer ago than the 4th of May, 1719, and being signed by four of the five commissioners of the Treasury, who have signed the appointment -which it is brought to justify, and having passed under silence, no occasion having happened to draw the validity thereof into question, it

T013 . PARL. HISTORY, 7 Georg* 1.1721 Ldrdt pG2

could be, as we conceive, of no authority to support the said last appointment when it was drawn in question, and ordered to be considered by the committee of the whole House ap-:pointed to inquire into the causes of the late:unhappy turn of affairs, which has so much^ affected the public credit at home.

“ For the aforesaid reasons, and lest it might be deemed to be a prejudging of a matter, | that may possibly be brought judicially before us.

The Director* *of the South Sea Company examined by the Lords.] The same day, it was ordered by the Lords, That all the Directors of the South Sea Company, as are not members of the House of Commons, together with the Treasurer, Under Treasurer, Accountant General, and Secretary, of the said Company, do attend this House on Thursday next.

Jan. 16. The Lords ordered. That the judges do forthwith prepare, and bring in, a Bill, to incapacitate the Sub Governor, Deputy Governor, and Directors, of the South Sea Company, from holding or exercising any office longer than t<rthe time of the next election of Directors of the said Company; and that provision be made in such Bill, to incapacitate the said Sub Governor, Deputy Governor, and' Directors, from bearing 'any office in the East India Company, or the Bank of England.

Jan. 21. A Petition of the Sub Governor, Deputy Governor, and the Directors of the South Sea Company, being read, praying to he heajrd by their counsel, as to the Bill brought up from the Commons, for restraining the petitioners from going out of the kingdom, &c. the said Bill was read a seeond time, and committed to a committee of the whole House for Monday. Then it being proposed, That the intent of the Bill being to prevent the petitioners from withdrawing their persons and effects, for making satisfaction and for punishing them for the notorious breach of trust, which they have already appeared guilty of, or which they*do not deny or excuse in their Petition, that therefore the Petition be rejected; and the question being put upon the said proposition, it Was resolved in the affirmative.

After this it was ordered, That the Brokers, do lay before the House an account of all the stock and subscriptions bought or sold by them, for any of the officers of the Treasury or Exchequer, or any in trust for them, or any of them, to the best of their knowledge, and belief since Michaelmas, 1, 719. By this account it appearing that large quantities of South Sea Stock had been transferred to the use of Mr. Aislabie, one of the Lords of the Treasury, t-he duke of Wharton said, He hoped some great men would produce some good fruit, else they would break out into blotches, that would stick upon them, like the leprosy of Naaman the Syrian on Gehasi.

Jan. 24. The Lords, in a grand committee, examined Mr. Joye, Deputy Governor, who made a Very ingenuous confession of several important matters.

Upon a motion made by lord Stanh6pe, sir William Chapman, Mr. Houlditch, Mr. Hawes, Mr. Gibbon, and Mr. Chester, five of the Directors, after being examined, were ordered into the custody of the black rod.

Jan. 26. The Lords examined Mr. Astell and sir Harcourt Masters, who made very ingenuous and large discoveries, and named several persons both in the administration, and in the House of Commons^ to whom large sums, in South Sea'stock, had been given fot procuring the passing of the South Sea Act. After Which, upon a motion made by the earl Stanhope, and seconded by the lord Townshend and earl Cowper, their lordships unanimously resolved, “ That the taking in of stock, the transferring of stock to the South Sea Cqpipany, the giving credit for the same without a valuable consideration actually paid, or sufficiently secured; or the purchasing stock, by any Director or Agent of the South Sea Company, for the use or benefit of any person in the administration, or any member of either House of Parliament, during such time as the late Bill relating to the South Sea Company was depending last year in parliament, was a notorious and dangerous corruption.”

Jan. 31. The Lords, in a grand committee, examined Mr. Waller, son-in-law to Mr. Aislabie, and Mr. Astell, severally, in relation to a great quantity of South Sea stock which ap? peared to have been transferred to, and negociated by the said Mr. Waller, who pretended not to have kept Minutes of what he had done in Exchange-alley. This some Lords looked upon as prevarication, and the said Examination being over, their lordships resolved, “ That the Directors of the South Sea Company, having ordered great qaantities of stock to be bought for the service of the Company, when stock was at very high prices, under pretence of keeping up the price of stock; and at the same time several of the Directors, and other Officers belonging to the Company, having, in a clandestine manner, sold their owtl stock to the Company, such Directors and Officers were thereby guilty of a notorious fraud and breach of trust; and their so doing was one great cause of the unhappy turn of affairs that has so much affected the Public Credit.”

Feb. 3. The Lords, in a committee, examined Mr, Hawes, one of the late Directors.

Sir John Blunt examined by the Lords.] Feb. 4. Sir John Blunt* was examioed by

the grand committee. The particulars of his Examination are as follows:

Sir John Blunt being called in, and the book of the account of stock sold, being shewn to him, he was asked if* it contained a true account; he said, he never saw a true.account of stock sold, and in one place his name being mentioned, be says, he does .not know he sold that stock.

And being asked if he was of the Committee of the Treasury; he answered, he was not; then being asked if he was of the Committee for taking care of the Company’s interest, in . relation to the bill; he desired to refer himself to the books of thb Company. Owned he 'might possibly be at the Court of Directors, when the book of stock sold was brought to them from the Committee of Treasury, but it was not read over there.

Asked if he ever sold any of the stock, to any person %of the administration, or any member of either House of Parliament; and thereupon insisted, it was the right of an Englishman not to accuse himself, if it was a criminal matter, if not, he would give the best answer be could.

He was directed to withdraw.

Proposed he be called in again, and told he roust answer the question; and thereupon he was called in, and asked accordingly; and says, he is sensible of the weight of falling

“ Sir John Blunt, originally a scrivener, was 1 one of the Projectors of the South Sea Cotn- pany, and afterwards one of the Directors and chief Managers of the famous Scheme in 1720'. He was also one of those who suffered most severely by the Bill of Pains and Penalties on the said Directors. He was a Dissenter of a most religious deportment, and professed to be a great believer. Whether he really did credit the prophecy here mebtioned is not certain, but it was constantly in this very style he declaimed against the corruption and luxury of the age, the partiality of parliaments, and the misery of party spirit. He was particularly eloquent against avarice in great and noble persons, of which he had indeed lived to see many miserable examples. He died in the year 1732.” Pope; Epiitk to Alien lord Bathurst.

under the displeasure of this House; but being required either peremptorily to answer, Or withdraw, he acquainted the Committee lie had been under a strict examination already before the Secret Committee of the Commons, and answered several questions long and various, and would not be thought to prevaricate, having no copy of what he had before sworn.

He then owned he bad disposed of two sum9, 6,000l. to col. Monroe at 275, and 1,000l. to Mr. Banks at 310, both of the House of Commons; be took Mr. Banks's note for payment of the money, and gave him a note that the st^ck should be delivered, and the money, was paid soon after it became due, and be gave it to Mr. Knight; fie, this examinant, did not tell him yvhose stock it tras, wherefore Mr. Banks thought it was his own, he believes; but has told him since the session, it was the Company’s stock.

Sir John being asked if he offered to put another name in his stead, he believes he did, and that Mr. Banks said, it might stand in his own name; he likewise said, he believed the colonel did not know it was the Company’s' stock, he having never told him it was, as hd remembers.

Asked if the practice of taking the stock, was resolved on by the Directors; and answers, he cannot say it, but owned they might have consulted about jt.

He was directed to call to memory all such as he transacted for, of what any other of the Directors did of that kind.

And says, it is impossible for him to recollect; repeated, that he has been under examination before to this matter in another place, and therefore hopes to be excused answering, lest his evidence should differ.

And being required to give an account if other Directors did not consult him about matters , of this nature; heSnade the same excuse, as to his being examined in another place, and declined to answer.

He is again directed to withdraw.

Proposed to call him in again, and. ask him if he did not take stock in for any person in the administration, he naming before only two of the House of Commons; and being called in and asked accordingly, says, he does not remember he did sell or take in any stock for any person in the administration.

The last question but one being asked him, says, he would be very loth to offend this august body, and would be glad he could get a copy of what he had sworn in another place; whereupon he was told, if he did not answer, it would be reported so to the House; he hoped he should have indulgence, declaring he would do nothing to create offence.

Asked if he had any other reason for his refusal than that he has already given; and says, no other than his being examined by the Committee of the Commons; but it being insisted on he should answer, he still hoped for indulgence, in referring to his former examination.

He was then asked, if any person had ftd *

Vised or* directed him, diitectly, or indirectly, to refuse to give an account of what he was before asked, as to his taking in, or selling stock to any in the administration, or .members of either House, and says, no.

Asked whether he knows of any other directors, or their officers, that have sold or taken in stock for any in the administration, or members of either House; and says, lie has before given an account, and again desires to refer to his examination before the secret committee of the Commons.

• Asked whether he knew or heard of any stock taken in, or to be taken in, for any person in the treasury: and declining to answer, he was peremptorily asked, whether he would answer or no; and says, he was sensible of the danger of falling under their lordships* displeasure, and would gladly be excused.

Then it being insisted on he should withdraw, be Withdrew accordingly.

• Proposed this Matter lie reported to the House, also proposed sir John Blunt be again called in, whereupon a motion being made, and the question being put, That the said sir John Blunt be now called in, '

It was resolved in the affirmative.

Called in accordingly, and asked the last question; and says, he did not sell stock to any of them, nor knows of any sold to any person of the Treasury, and it was a hard thing to be put to speak upon hearsay.

He is again directed to withdraw.

Then a debate arose how to proceed in this unprecedented Case, and severe reflections were made against those in power by the duke of Wharton, who observed. That the government of the best princes was oftentimes made intolerable to their subjects, by ill ministers, which his grace illustrated by the example of Sejanus, who made a division in the. imperial family, and rendered the reign of the emperor Claudius odious to the Romans. This reflection was highly resented by the earl Stanhope, * who

* My lord Stanhope spoke with so great vehemence, that finding himself taken suddenly with a violent head-acn, he went home and was cupped, which eased him a little. The next morning, he was let blood; and continued pretty well till about six o’clock in the evening, when falling into a drowziness, his physicians thought fit to order him a glysfcer; but as he was turning himself to receive it, he fell on his face, and was instantly suffocated. The news of his death being brought to-the king, his majesty was so sensibly touched with.it, that he could not eat his supper, and his majesty retired for two hours into his closet, to lament the loss of so able and so faithful a minister, of whose service his majesty had so great need, at' this critical juncture.” Political State.

took upon him to vindicate his colleagues; and brought several instances from the Roman history, particularly that of the great patriot,

• Brutus, who, in order to assert the liberty ot Rome, and free.it from tyrants, sacrificed hie own degenerate son. This skirmish being over, the Lords adjourned the farther consideration of that matter to the 14th, when sir John Blunt was ordered to attend again, also the directors and their officers, as was likewise Mr. Waller.

Feb. 7. The House proceeded to take into consideration the behaviour of sir John Blunt, at the bar on Saturday, 'and came to the following Resolution, “ That sir John Blunt having been asked several questions, by the com-, mittee of the whole House, upon oath, and having not only prevaricated in such Examination, but having refused to give any answer to several material questions, and being thereupon required to be examined before this House at the bar, and there, out of some evil intention, obstinately refusing to take his oath, in order to his examination, is guilty of the highest contempt of this House, manifestly tending to de* feat all parliamentary inquiries and examinations, and, of dangerous consequences to the constitution.”

Mr. Knight, Cashier of the South Sea -pant/, makes his Escape to .] Jan. 23. Mr. Serj.Pengelly, from the Committee of Secrecy, acquainted the Commons; That Mr. Robert Knight, Cashier of the South Sea Company,

guards, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, in 1694; was a member of the House of Commons from 1700 till created a peer; served a volunteer in 1702 in the expedition to Cadiz, . and next year in Portugal; was made a brigadier-general in 1704; envoy extraordinary to, Charles 3, in 1706; major general in 1707; and commander in chief of the forces in Spain, 1708. Thq same year he subdued Minorca; and in 1710 commanded the English forces at the battles of Almanza and Saragossa. He was constituted first commissioner of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer, April 11, 1717; created viscount Stanhope of Mahon, July 24; secretary of state, March 21, 1717-, 18; earl Stanhope, April 9, 1718; and was sent the same year to France and Spain, to conclude the negociations for a general peace; was one of the lords justices in 1719; was twice io France, where he brought the king of Spain to accede to the Quadruple Alliance; and on his return \vas again one of the lords justices. He was suddeuly seized with a dizziness in his head, occasioned by the vehemence of a debate in the House of Peers, Feb. 4, 1720-1: and died next day.” .

Hereupon it was resdlved, netn. con. to present two Addresses to the king, “ To isstle a Proclamation, with a reward for discovering, -apprehending, and1 detaining the said Robert Knight, thathe may be brought to justice. 3, To give orders forthwith to stop the ports, and to take effectual care of the coasts, to prevent the said Mr.' knight, or any other Officers of the South Sea Company, from escaping out of the Kingdom.” These Addresses were directly carried to the King by Mr. Methuen, and his majesty returned for Answer, that he would immediately give the necessary orders according to the desire of the House: accordingly a Proclamation was published, with 3,000l. Reward for apprehending Mr, Knight.

' Several of the Soutk-Sp* Direeten eeeured and expelled the House.] The Commons having ordered their doors to be locked, and the keys laid on the table, summoned sir Robert Chap* lin, bart. sir Tbpodore Janssen, bart. Mr. F* Ryles, and Mr. Sawbridge, to attend in their places immediately; then general Rom ao« quainted the House, “ That they had already discovered a train of the deep* frM *

Mr. Sawbridge, and sir Theodore Janssen* being come into the House, a motion was so* verafiy made; “ That they were guilty of a no-

fit to retire out of the kingdom; and having on Sunday the S2d absented himself from his house, embarked on Monday morning in the river, on board a vessel, that carried him the same evening to Calais. The same morning; a’ porter delivered to Mr. Surman the following Letter, directed to the South Sea Company:

‘ Gentlemen:

• ‘ I write this from a true sense of the obliga-

* gation I am under to make up my accompts

* with the Company, and tb pay them their full.

‘ demand: And though self-preservation has obliged me to withdraw myself from the re-

* sentment against theDirectors and myself; yet I ‘am not conscious to myself, of having done any ‘ one thing thatl can reproach myself for, so far as

relates to an finest, sincere intention and zeal ‘ for the Company; - but I can, and do charge 4‘myself with a great many indiscretions, and ‘ am (besides the concern I must be under for ‘ leaving my own family, friend ^, &c.) very sen-‘ sibly touched with what you are like Jo suffer

* on this account; and it will be the more, I am ‘ afraid, from your want of unanimity, which I ‘ heartily recommend to you for the future, and, ‘lam sure, wish you as well as you wish your-•* selves.

‘ I write this at a distance from home, and ‘ under a great deal of concern, so cannot be ‘ so particular as otherwise I would have been.

‘ I nave herewith sent Mr. Surman the key of ‘ my desks, who knows so much of the state of the cash, as to be able to make it up. There ‘ are pgood many Bills Of Exchange, aod other ‘ payments to write off, and the weekly receipts ‘ to write on. . There is cash in the Bank, in ‘ the company’s book, wbjch, together with the

* notes taken op the third and fourth subscriptions, tind the company’s bonds, will make

* up the balance, as I do believe. But if it fall .. ‘ short, I have 3,000 equivalent stock, 1,000

‘ Bank stock, 2,000 India and South Sea slock, -‘ over and above what I-owe the.company on the loan, as will be sufficient to make it up: 4 with money owing on securities on my pur-:

‘ ticular account. The company need not de-‘ liver or be answerable for the subscription ‘ receipts or stock op the third and fourth sub-, A scriptions, unless these notes are paid.; so l‘ the loss can only be the difference between*.

‘ the subscriptions, and money in value. And,

‘ I think, it would be bard for me to bear the :* loss, because the clerks took by far the *

‘ greatest part of them, as thinking them better-'* than none. And. most of them would have* A been non-payments, if they had been refused.

Jan. 24. The Commons resolved, nem. eon. to address the King, to give directions to his ministeVs, at foreign courts, to make application for Mr. Knight, if he should shelter himself in any of their dominions, to be surrendered tip in order to be brought to justice; Which directions his majesty gave accordingly,

Jan. 28. Sir Robert Chaplin, bars, and Mr. Francis Kyles, Directors of the South-Sea company, attending in their places, they were both likewise; for their offence, expelled the House.

February 3. Mr. Robert Walpole presented to the House a bill, “ For ingrafting part of the Capital Stock and fond of the 8outn-Sea Company into die stock and fond of the Bank of England; and another part thereof into the .stock and fund of' the East India Company which was read the first time, find ordered to be read a second time on the 7th.

Feb. 7. The said Bill was read a second time, and amotion being made for committing it to a committee of the whole House, it occasioned m high debate, in which Mr. R. Walpole, Mr. Heath, and some others, insisted for the affirmative; and Mr. Milner, Mr. Sloper, Mr. Clayton, and sir. Joseph Jekyll, for the negative; and it was at last carried for the former by 237 voices against 139.

Feb. 8. Mr. Hungerford presented to the .House a bill, ‘ For the better Establishment of

Debate in the Lords on a Report of Mr. Knight’s being apprehended.] Feb. 9. Lord Cowner took notice to the House of the report of Mr. jktoight’9 being .taken and in custody, which being a matter in which the public was highly concerned, he desired those in the administration to acquaint the House, whether there was anyground for that report ?

The Earl of Sunderland having upon this informed the House in what manner Mr. Knight bad been apprehended and secured; a motion <%aS made to address his majesty ', to order his ministers abroad, to use the most effectual instances to have him delivered up, and sent over. Hereupon

* Lor d Camper represented, That the person, who at present took care of his majesty’s affairs «t Brussels, being a foreigner, it were therefore proper for the 'House either to send a messenger ef their own, or to desire his majesty to send

a special messenger to bring over Mr. Knight *, who was so material in evidence in the present inquiry into the villainous frauds of the late ‘ South-Sea Directors, and their abettors.

The Lord Towmhend said thereupon, Thpt either of these would imply adistrust of his majesty’s care m this affair, which they had-all the reason in the world to be satisfied in:that upon the application made to his majesty, for using his endeavours to get Mr. Knight secured, twelve expresses were immediately dispatched for that purpose to his majesty’s minister# abroad; and that these orders had been executed with such diligence? by the secretary of his majesty's resident, at Brussels, that Mr. Knight was actually apprehended, and in safe custody:concluding, . That it became the wig- dom of that august assembly, to express their grateful acknowledgements to his majesty for his past care, and to rely on his future endeavours for getting Mr. Knight delivered up, and sent oyer.

Accordingly? the same day an Address was presented, to which his majesty returned for Answer, That he would give the necessary orders, and use his utmost endeavours to have Mr. Knight secured and brought over.

A similar Address was also agreed , to by the Commons.

Petition from the South SeaCompanyfor uU loving them farther Time for Payment of the. Money due from them to the Public.] Feb. 13. Upon the reading of the order of the House, for going into a grand committee upon the Bill, For in ‘ grafting Part of the Capital Stock and Fund of the South-Sea Company; &c.* A Petition of the South-Sea Company was offered to be presented to the House, and the members in Westminster-Hall, Court of Requests, and places adjacent, having been summoned to attend the service of thp House, the said Petition was brought up and read, praying the consideration of the House, in relation to the payments of the several Sums . of Money, which by the act of parliament of the last session, th'e said Company are subject and liable to, for the usa of the public, at the times, and in the manner by the said act directed, and praying sach relief, as to the House should seem meet.

Hereupon, a motion was made, and insisted on by Mr. Sbippen and several others, That the said Petition be rejected; but they being opposed by Mr. Robert Walpole, and all the Court party, and the question being put thereupon, it was. carried in the negative, by 233 Voices against 166; however, the said Petition was ordered to lie on the table; and then another motion was made by the country party, that it be an instruction to the said Committee^ that they have power to receive a clause for excluding the Directors of theSouth-SeaCompany, East India Company and the Bank of England, from being elected members, or sitting and voting in any future parliament: but, after some debate, the question being put there-

This Message was referred to the consideration of a Committee of the whole House the Friday following:and then a clause wa9 ordered to be inserted in the Bill, For ingrafting part of the Stock and Fund of the South Sea Company, to restrain the Corporations of the Bank'of England, of the South Sea Company, and of the East India Company, from lending any sum of money to their proprietors upon their stock exceeding 100/. for 100/. capital stock.

trust reposed in them. 4 At the entrance into, their enquiry they observed the matters referred to them were of.great variety and extent. Many persons were entrusted with different parts in the execution of, this law, and under the colour thereof acted in an unwarrantable manner, in disposing of the properties of many thousands of persons, amounting to many millions of money.

fictitious entries, with blanks, erasures, and alterations, and in some, the leaves were tom out. Some books had been destroyed, others secreted. ' 1

“ Before the South Sea Bill was passed, and •with a view to promote it, the Directors, to whom the secret management was principally intrusted, bad disposed of a fictitious stock of 574,000l. This stock was noted as sold at several days, and at various prices, from 150 to 325 per cent, amounting in the whole to 1, 259, 325?* it was to be esteemed as holden of the Company, for the benefit of the pretended purchasers, though no mutual agreement was then made for the delivery or acceptance of the stock at any stated time; no money was deposited, and no security given for the payments By this Contrivance, no loss codki have been sustained, if the stock should fall, and the gain would be received, if it should rise...

“ As this, fictitious stock was designed for promoting the Bill, the sub and deputy governors! Sir John Blunt, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Chester, Mr. Holditqh, and Mr. Knight, the cashier, bad the chief disposal of it, and it was distributed atf follows: .

To the earl of Sunderland, at the «£. request of Mr. Craggs, sen. - - 50,000

“ It also appeared, that Charles Stanhope had received a difference of 250,000l. through the hands of sir George.Caswal and. Co. but that his name had been, partly erased from their books, and altered to Stangape. That Aislabie, Chancellor of the Exchequer, had an account with Turner, Caswal, and Co. to the amount of794, 451/. and that he had advised the Company to make the second subscription 1, 500,000/, instead of a million, by their own authority, and without any warrant. That of the third subscription, Aislabie's list amounted to 70,000l. Sunderland's to 160,000l. Craggs’s to 659,000l. and Stanhope's to 47,000l.

7181 PARL. HIST. 7 George I. the South Sea Company.[71#

In the progress of their enquiry your Committee found it attended with many difficulties.

In some of the Books produced before them, false , and fictitious entries were made; in . ethers, entries with blanks; in others, entries with razures and alterations; and in others, leaves were torn out. They found farther, that some books had been destroyed, and others taken away or secreted; nevertheless, your Committee are enabled to lay some matters of importance before the House for their present consideration.

The first matter that offered itself to the consideration of > our Committee was a scene of iniquity and corruption, the discovery of which your Committee conceived to be of the highest importance.to the honour of parliaments, and the security of his majesty’s government.

.Your Committee observed, in the account .laid before the House by the court of directors of the South Sea Company, pursuant to your order the 13th day of December, that the Company were therein supposed to have re-. ceived the sum of 1, 259, 335 /.upon account of stock sold to the amount of 574, 500/. stock: whereupon your Committee ordered the Company's cash book to be laid before them, and upon inspection thereof, they found (at fol. lsqT^and 121) the several entries of stock, as styKf for the Company, annexed at the end of this repbrt, No. 1. the total of . which entries amount to the said sums of 574, 500 I.in stock; and of 1, 259, 325/. in, cash; but it is very observable, ibat from the . article.of the 4th of February, 1719, .untp that:of the 12th of April, 1720, both inclusive,

• there is no mention made of the name of any, person whatsoever to whom the stock is supposed to be sold.

t The whole accounts comprehended in these - two pages of the cash-book, and entered in this concealed manner, appear, nevertheless, to have Been stated and balanced by the . Company’s committee of treasury, without expressing the day when' such accounts were stated, and are-subscribed.by sir John Fellows, then sub-governor, Mr. Charles »Joye, then deputy-governor, sir Lambert Blackwell, sir Robert Chaplin, sir Theodore Janssen, Mr. Jacob. Saw bridge, and Stephen Child, then directors all of them of the said Committee, and sir Robert Chaplin, sir Theodore Janssen, and /Mr. Sawbridge, at that time members of this House.

Yoor Committee, upon this occasion, take the liberty to remind the House of a remarkable 'period in the last session of parliament; that upon the 2nd o.f February, 1719, the House . agreed to the report of the Committee of the whole House, appointed to consider of that part of his majesty’s speech which related to the public debts, that the proposals made by tha South Sea Company should be accepted,

. and ‘ordered a bill tp be brought in pursuant to the said resolution, which bill having passed ibis House, and afterwards the House of Peers,

bad the royal assent upon Thursday the 7th of

April, 1720.

' Your Committee, surprized to see so large an account of stock disposed of by the Company, before the passing the bill to enable the Company to increase their capital stock and fund, and befqre any subscription or redemption could be made, whereby their capital stock was increased, proceeded to examine Carefully into that transaction.

, And upon examination of the late sub and deputy-governors, and the late directors of the South Sea Company, Mr. Robert Knight, then cashier, Mr. Robest Surma a, then deputy-cashier, Mr. John. Grigsby, then accountant, Mr. Charles Lockyer, their 2nd accountant, and Mr. Mtuthew Weymondsold, broker, it manifestly appeared to your Committee, that the Company at that time was not possessed of such a quantity of stock, whereof they could then make an actual sale and transfer; the Company having at that time, in their own right, only a small quantity of stock, not exceeding 25,000l. or 30,000l. at the most. And upon the inspection of the transfer books of that time, as well as upon examination of. the before-mentioned persons, your Committee cannot find any .transfers made by the Company, of any part of that great quantity of stock, at the times specified in the cash-book, (excepting to the duke of Portland, the lord Delawar, and the honourable John West, esq.; who sold their annuities to the Company) and no account of any transfers of such stock has as yet been given into thin House, although by your order of the 17th of December last it was expressly required.

Upon farther examination of the persons before-mentioned, your Committee discovered that this supposed sale of stock was colourably entered in the book for the benefit of persons, whose names were designed to be concealed, with intentinn to make an interest in- favour of the Company, and to facilitate the acceptanow of the South Sea Proposals, and the passing the bill, which were at that time depending in parliament. And to that end, the late sub and deputy-governors, sir John Blunt, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Chester, and Mr. Holditch, late directors, who had the care of soliciting the passing the bill, together with Mr. Knight, the cashier, had the power of disposing of this stock.

And the general method by which this practice was carried on, was thus:

This stock was set down, as sold at several days and at several prices, from 150/. per cent, to 325/. per cent, and was from those times to be esteemed as taken in, or holden by the Company, for the benefit of the pretended purchasers, Although no mutual agreement was then, made for the delivery, or acceptance of the stock, at any certain time, and although no money was paid down, nor any deposit, or other security, given to the Company for payment, by the supposed purchasers: so that if the price of stock bad fallen, as inight be expected) if the scheme had miscarried, no lake

\

msi PAR!* HISTORY, 7 George L 1721. — Fir* Proceedings ^719

.£<¥*14 have been sustained by them; but if the price of stock should advance (as it actually •did by the success of the scheme) the differ--ence by' the advance price was to be made mood to the pretended purchasers: and accordingly the account of such stock was made up, and adjusted with Mr. Knight, and the money arising by the difference of the price, between the times; of such taking in, or bolding of the ' stock, and the making such adjustments, was ' paid, or allowed, out of the company's cash, to the pretended purchasers; but no, eatries of such adjustments, or of names of the persons . with whom the said were made, appear to yonr Committee in any. of the books of the Company.

Sir TheodoreJansten affirmed, that when the -said account in the cash-book was laid by Mr. Knight before their Committee of treasury, to be passed and signed, an objection being made that blanks were left for the hovers of this stock, the late sub-governor, and Mr. Knight, said, .there were reasons for passing the account in .that manner, and that the stock was disposed of to persons whose names were not proper to

• be known to a great many, hot at a fit time a '.perfect account thereof should be made tip, " and that if the bill did pass the stock would be

• wall sold.

Mr. Robert Surman declaredJ that about the , Sd bf April, 1720, Mr. Knight the cashier, shewed him that account of stock sold in the kash-book (fol. 120, and 121) and told the examinant, that there was a Committee appointed to look into the state of the cash that night, .and. that he, Mr. Knight, having thereby charged himself with the value of so large a quantity of stock sold, would appear to have a .great sum of money in his hands, which he ' realty had not, and'therefore said, he would . write off a supposed sum of 800,000l. as lent by . the Company to sundry persons upon400,000l. •lock, and Mr. Knight did then accordingly an ter the -same with his own hand, (fol. 180) of the said cash-book, in the following words,

“ 1720. April 3. By loan to sundries on security of 400,000l. South-Sea Stock, -at an interest of 6/. per cent, per annum. 800,000 /.

That Mr. Robert farther declared,

be did not know that any part of the said .money was really lent, but the entry was made to that effect by Mr. Knight, with an intention’ to answer, in part, the account of stock sold: be believed also that the entry in the same book was written by Mr. Knight, as follows, .(fol. 121.)

• April 14. By account of. loan on South-Sea

Stock, lent to sundries on security of 100,000l. stock at 250, at an interest of 5 per cent, per annum, 250,000l."

As to the greatest part, if not the whole of

• that ram, k was entered with the same view; and the examinant at that time took it, that this stock entered as sold in the cash-book, was not ' paid for, and for that reason Mr. Knight entered these sums of 800,000l. and 250,000^ as ‘•dually disbursed, to help to moke a balance

upon the-amount, - as it now stands infoe cash -book. '

That the examinant observing the said entry of stock sold, Mr. Knight told him, that it was a transaction of a private nature, and that » great part of it was disposed of to persons of distinction.

Mr. Aetellf one of the late directors; likewise declared, that he believed the said article of loan of >800,000l. on 400,000l. stock was entered as a blind to answer the account of receipts on the other side of the cash-book, for that be could not find any minute thereof in the other books of the company.

Mr. -StephenChild said, that he took the

articles of stock bought and sold in the cashbook, to be fictitious, and to be entered in that meaner merely to make a balance.

' Whilst your committee had this matter under examination, viz. upon the 27th day of January last* the court of directors (pursuant to yoer order of the 17th of December preceding, requiring a particular account of mis stock sold, and by whom, and to whom transferred) laid before this House a'book, containing an account of stock sold, as they received it from their committee of treasury, without mentioning that any partof such stock was actually transferred.

And your committee examining into (bat account, sir John Blunt (from whom year committee received the first material informations) the late sub and deputygovUrnofls, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Astell, Mr. Chester, late directors, and Mr. Robert Surman, informed them, that they believed, and that it was generally so understood among foe directors, that the said account laid before this House, k not a true account; and that there are many fictitious names therein, as the names of several brokers and others, which are made use of to cover the names of other persons, who bad the real benefit of such stock, and who nevertheless are net mentioned in that account, but that the names of persons of distinction or condition therein contained ard real.

Mr. Astell declared, that pressing Mr. Knight upon the repeated orders of Cbe directors to make up the account-of this stock, Mr. Knight answered, that he could adt comply with these orders, without giving up forty or fifty of the Company's best friends.

Mr. Robert Surman gave your committee a ferther explanation of the framing foie account as follows.

That since the order of the House requiring this account, he assisted Mr. Knight m preparing a draught thereof, and by Mr. Knightfs direction, he wrote down several ntuftes, which Mr. Knight read to him out of a book with a green cover, wherein Mr. Knight had kept an account of this stock entered in foe cash-book of the Company, and also of subscriptions, bet believed Mr. Knight did not give him all the true names, because Mr. Knight sometimes turned over a leaf or two without giving him a name, although there were- m-footoleavesaimtee

/of persons wish whom an account was there entered. And Mr. Surman farther said, that he remeinhered, that in the saaae book, at the head of a large account, wherein the debtor side came near to the bottom of the, page, he saw, the name of John Aisjabie, esq. late chancellor of the exchequer, but Mr. Knight turned over that leaf, and did not give him that oame to iasert in ib» account.

That at the head of aaether account, in the same book, he saw the name of James Craggs,

C*That at die head of another account in that book, he saw the name of Charles Stanhope, esq.

All which were accounts of stock and subscriptions, but Mr. Knight left out all these names in this account; and after it was. thus drawn out from the green book, and from some letters which Mr. Knight then delivered to this examinant, the sums not coming right, Mr. Knight; made several alterations in the names and, prices, and inserted other names and .prices to frame the account in the manner: it now appears.

< Mr. Francis Ha»est one of the late directors,

likewise declared, that about the time of making the last Midsummer, dividend; Mr. Knight informed him, that he (Mr. Knight) held stock for John Aislabie, esq, and that he had an account of stock depending with Mr. Aislabie, and the examinant believed that such stock had been.taken in seme time before, and that Mr. Knight held such stock with the Company's money.

And the examinant added, that he believed the reason of entering the 974>, bOQL stock sold, in the cash-book, was to give persons an opportunity of having stock at low prices, and thatgreat part of the stock sold, was disposed of for the forwarding the bill.

Yojnr committee proceeding to examine sir John Slant, concerning the- disposal of the fictitious South-Sea Stock before-mentioned, be acquainted them, that the-latter end of February, or the beginning of March last, Mr. Knight (old Him, and:(as he remembered) the late deputy-governor, Mr. Gibbon, and Mr. Chester, that Mr. Craggs the post-master desired to have 60,000l. stock bought, or taken in at the current price, viz. AO,000 /.for the ‘earl of Sunderland, or his; friends, and the remaining 60,000l. for. Mr/ Graggs, or hisfriends: that this request was complied with, and 80,000l. of the company's stock was directed to be applied accordingly, which the examinant takes to be part of the sum of 118,000l. entered into the company’s cash-book as sold on the 27th day of fWto-qury- 1719, at 175/. per cent. That no money appears to have been paid for the above-mentioned 80,000l. But sir John Blunt •aid/, that' some rime in March Mr.’ Knight shewed him a note for the 50,000l. stock, signed Bttrtddrlandy which Mr. Knight said was the earl of Sunderland's hand, and the examinant' behoved it to- be so, havingseen his lord-dripfc' hadd to .trbMUKy-ww&ote.aad -orders;

The note, to the best of his remembrance, wa»r to the effect following. That whereas Mr. Knight had bought several parcels of South-Sen Stock for the earl of Sunderland, ; the particu- -lars of which were therein specified, amounting in the whole to 500,000 Lstock, at several prices, i the money payable for which amounts to more than 80,000 Lhis lordship promised to pay the -said money, with interest, at a certain tithe < therein mentioned: that since the beginning» of this -session of parliament, the examinant and Mr. Knight discoursing about the company's’fictitious stock, and> particularly concerning the’ earl of Suaderland's part of it, the examinant asked how he would conceal that ? Mr. Knight replied, be would go through -thick and thin rather than discover it. That the examinant i does not know of any money paid, or note, or other security, given- by Mr. Craggs for the 80, 00Ok residue of the 80,000l. stock,

Mr. Edward Gibbon, another of the lath di* rectors, said, that Mr. Knight told him, that some time in February, 1719, he was to supply: and formshtbeearkof Sunderland, with 50; 000/. stock, at between 170 and 180/. per cent, which was the'price of stock at that time.

Mr; Joye, late deputy-governor, declared*’that Mr. Knight, about ten or eleven months since* told him, that 100,000/; stock must be reserved for Mr. Craggs of the Post-office, intrust for others; thereupon the examinant> asking, WbatJ for my lord' Sunderland; he replied, not for himself, but his friends. Mr.' Joye said farther, that Mr. Knight told hitn since the inquiry began, that the sum promised to Mr. Craggs was but 30,000l.

The before named James, esq. being '

examined, said, that he never did apply to Mr.' Knight, or any other person whatsoever, to have any of the Company's $tock, or to have any stocktaken in for bitn by the Company.

Mr. Richard Holditcht another of the late directors, said, that he was told by Mr. Knight; That 50,000l. of the company's stock, said to ' be sold, was held for a-noble lord in a high station. That he apprehended and believed’that by the lord in a high station, Mr. Knight meant the earl of Sunderland; but Mr. Knight being since asked aboat it, said, }hat it did not go. that way, but it went another way, or words’to that effect.

Your Committee in the course of sir Jdhn Blunt's examination asked him, whether he -knew of any more of the Company's stock disposed of, in order to facilitate the passing the bill ? He answered, that he believed the’dutchess of Kendal, her two nieces, and the countess of- Platen, were the. persons for whose ! benefit 36,000l. stock was entered in the Company's cash-book, as sold on the 4th of February, 1719.

That some time after the 4th day of February^ 1719, and while the said scheme, or bill, was depending in the Hotfse* Mr. Secretary Craggs, in Westminster-hall, spoke to him/ and tothe late sub-and deputy-governors, add to Mr. 5 Chester, on the behalf of the persons, above *

named) and s^id, he really'thought it was for the interest of the Company to engage persons of their rank to be concerned in it, of* words to that effect; whereupon it was agreed, that they should have 36,000l. of the Company’s stock at the price mentioned, which was 150 per cent, although the market price, as he be* fieved, was then somewhat bigger: That he took it for granted the agreement was since made good.

That Mr. Knight had the management of this affair, and used to keep an account of the stock thus disposed of in a book of his own; but he then apprehended the duchess of Kendal, and the countess of Platen, did not either of them know that the other was to have any stock.

Sir John Fellows, late sub-governor, on his examination said, that whilst the proposals from the South Sea Company, or the Bill in the House of Commons was depending, Mr. Knight told him, that- Mr. Secretary Craggs proposed, that 12,000l. of the company’s stock should be disposed of to' the duchess of Ifcndal, 12,000l. to the countess of Platen, and 12,000l. to the duchess’s two, nieces. The examinant agreed they should have the stock, paying the market-price, which was then above 150 per cent.; But Mr. Knight telling the examinant, , that he thought they were entitled to, the stock from the first application made for it, et which time the price was about 150 per cent.; this examinant consented that they should have it at that price. He added farther, that Mr. Secretary Craggs did at his office . recommend the above-mentioned proposal, and said that it would be for the service of thfe company to have such persons proprietors. He said likewise, that the same proposal was at another time made to him and others by Mr. Secretary Craggs in Westminster-hall. That the examinant and the deputy-governor waited on the duchess of Kendal, and acquainted her with the proposals, and that Mr. Knight should have orders to follow her directions, and desired her good offices on the Company's behalf; that the duchess received them civilly, and thanked them for it. The examinant said also, That a letter was wrote by Mr. Knight to the countess of Platen, signed by the examinant, and the deputy-governor, to acquaint her with the said proposal, and that she wrote an answer, signifying her acceptance, but that he had lost the letter.

Mr. Edward Gibbon, another of the said directors, being examined, declared, That whilst the Soutb-Sea bill was depending in the House, he was at a conversation in Westminster-hall, at which were present Mr. Secretary Craggs, the sub and deputy-governors, and Mr. Chester, where Mr. Secretary proposed, that about 30,000l. stock should be disposed of to certain Jaidies, whose having stock would be of service to the Company, or to that effect, which was consented to; and be believed they were foreigners, but did not know their names.

Joye, the late deputy-governor, informed

the Committee that soin'e time before the above-mentioned conversation in Westminster-hall, Mr. Knight told him, Mr. Secretary Craggs had mentioned to him, that it would beadvise-able to bave some great ladies concerned in the Company’s stock, and that they should have it at 150 per cent. That soon after sir John Fellows, Mr. Knight, and himself, being at Mr. Secretary Craggs’s office, the same proposal was again renewed by the secretary, and was consented to by sir-John Fellows, Mr. Knight, and himself; he did not exactly remember the proportions in which the stock was to be provided, but on the best recollection he could make, be thought the duchess of Kendal was to have 10,000l. stock, and the countess of Platen the like sum, and the duchess’s nieces 5,000l. each.

Mr. Joye said also, That there was a conversation with Mr. Secretary Craggs in Westminster-hall, concerning the aforementioned proposal; That he could not recollect what then passed, but remembered that soon after sir John Fellows and himself were introduced to the duchess of Kendal, by Mr. Secretary Craggs, who interpreted between them; that they acquainted her with the offer, and that directions would be given to Mr. Knight, to transfer the 'stock on payment of the money; that the duchess seemed well pleased with the offer, thanked them, and wished them good success.

He farther said, that talking with Mr. Knight, since this inquiry began, he said, that neither the duchess of Kendal, nor her nieces, had any stock transferred to them, but that the oountess of Platen had; to which Mr. Joye replied, that he did toot believe him.

Mr. Robert Chester, one of the late directors* being examined likewise about the said conversation in Westminster-hall, concurred, in substance, with what sir John Fellows has before declared.

Sir John Blunt said likewise, that after this examination oii Friday the 27th of January last, Mr. Joye came to his lodgings, and asked 'him touching what had passed in his examination before your committee. That sir John Blunt told him, he had said nothing of the ministry: What! says Mr. Joye, nor of the ladies neither? To which sir John replied, that he had not.

That oh Saturday the 28th of january last* soon after sir John Blunt had been again examined by your committee at the Soutb-Sea house, Mr. Joye came to him, and asked bit* what had passed; that sir John told him be was under an obligation of Secrecy; that he loved bim very well, and that the best way wax to tell the whole truth:What, says Mr. Joye, of the ladies, and all ? Yes (says sir John) the examination is vary strict, and nothing but the truth will do.

Mr. Joye being examined by your -committee to the al>ove- mentioned conversation. between bim and sir John Blunt, did adtaHt that the substance ot it was true.

Mr. Hnlditehalso informed <your Committee

that Mr, Knight told him, that %Q, 0QQL of tb *

Company’s slock, said to be sold, was for a certain person, whtf had deserved well; and that some other person, or.persons of distinction at court (or words to that effect) were to have 40 or $0,000l. of the Company's stock reserved for them. ' -

Sir John Blunt being again examined, in-

formed your committee, that Mr. Knight had the chief management of the disposal of the Company's Stock; and, that whilst the South-Sea hill was depending in the House of Commons, Mr. Knight acquainted him, that Mr. Charles Stanhope, one of the secretaries of the treasury, desired to have 10,000l. stock bought, -or taken in, for him, at the market-price, which was then about 250/. per cent, but the said Mr. Stanhope did not absolutely agree to have the ftock at that time; but the same day, or the day following, Mr. Knight shewed sir John Blunt a letter, signed Charles Stanhope, where he desired to have the said '10,000l. stock bought, or taken in, for him, and sir Jolrn BLuut consented that he sbould'have it accordingly-

, That on the strictest enquiry your Committee cannot discover, that the said Mr. Stanhope ever paid, or gave any security to pay, for the said stock, or that any actual transfer was made to him of it.

Mr. Richard Holditcli being again examined, said, he understood by Mr. Knight, that 10 or 12,000l. of the Company’s stock, said to be sold, was held for Mr. Charles Stanhope of the treasury.

That Mr. Knight told him, that the .said Mr. Stanhope was undetermined in the morning, when he first mentioned k, whether he would havek or no, but in the evening agreed to have k.

bYour Committee find upon inspection of the account, of cash kept by the South-Sea Company with the Bank of England, that by notes drawn upon the Bank by the cashier of the South-Sea Company, che sums following, amounting to 51, 736/. 13s. were paid to Charles Stanhope, esq. one of the secretaries of the treasury, out of the cash of the South Sea Company, at the days following, viz. May the 7th, 6, 662/. 13s. May the 12th, 600/. June the 18th, 40, 609/. September the 10th, 4, 865/.

. Gpos the examination of Jacob Sawbridge, esq. late one of the directors, and of the Committee of treasury of the South-Sea Company, and^also a copartner with Elias Turner and company, with whom part of the cash of the South Sea Company had been usually kept, till amtbin tbnefe or four months past, and upon perusal of their books, yoar Committee discovered a disposition of 50,000l. of the Company’s stack, (as it was then called) unto the said Turner, Sawbridge, and sir George Caswall, whtch'suaa oow appears in the account of stock tedd, laid before this House, viz.

: March 81. Tamer, Caswall, and Company, (60,000l. 850) 120,000l. r Ditto. tOflQQl. (870) 2r,000 ' Thp particular of which affair, w far as k r«-Voi* VIL

lates to the mid 50,000l. your committee do now lay before the House; and for the better information of the House, they have annexed in the Appendix to their Report, No. II. exact transcripts of their several articles and accounts contained in the several books of Turner.and company, unto which thei r Report has reference.

Sir Jacob Sawbridge being examined, as to his passing and signing the account of stock sold, entered in the cash-book of the South-Sea \ Company, without the names of the persons to, v whom it was sold; and also the disposition*^ thereof, acknowledged that he allowed and signed the said account, and made no objection thereto, Mjv Knight saying, that the account was right; but the examinant said he could not tell to whom that stock was sold, ?• Mr. Knight not giving the committee of treasury any particulars thereof; but at length Mr. Sawbridge owned that he had 50,000l. part of the 68,000l. stock mentioned in the cash-book to be sold the 31st day of March 1719, at 250/. per cent, and said that when the' charter of Turner and company was ordered to be laid before the committee, appointed the last session of parliament, to enquire into and examine the several subscriptions for fishery, and other projects, the said Turner and company were obliged to sell 50,000l. South-Sea" stock more than they had, (which he called Selling the ‘ bear') and hearing that the South-Sea Company were selling stock, he bought (as he said) this 50,000l. stock of the Company, but admitted that he did not pay down auy money for it, and that there was no agreement iu writing re- >. lating thereunto, but if the price of stock bad fallen, he said he most have stood to the loss of it; that this stock was not then delivered to him, but was delivered to him, or his order, by Mr. Robert Surman, upon the 11th of June 1720, at which time he paid the money for it, amounting to 125,000l. that the price of stock was then advanced to 750/. per cent, so that at the- market-price this 50,000l., stock comes to 375,000l. and that he entered in his book

125, 00 01:paid to the South Sea Company, and entered 250,000l. as paid to his own cash, bud did not receive any money.

That he directed this account of stock to be entered in a fictitious name, that their servants might not know it to be the proper stock of Turner and company, and earned it to the account of stock iii their books, where it ip blended with the rest of the stock.

But Sir John Fellows said, that he did not know of any particular parcel of stock holden for Turner and company, till lately; and said he did not remember the disposal of the 50,000l. stock, to them; that Mr. Knight used to transact with them, and he (the examinaqt) believed, the Company did not intend to give them the benefit of so much stock.

Your committee proceeding to inspect the hooks of Turner and company, and to examine Daniel Watkins, one of their clerks, and alsq Mr. Jacob Sawbridge, do find, that upon the 11th of June, 1720, this 50,000/, stock and the 3 A

improved value thereof, amounting to 375,000l. was regularly placed to the account of Charles Stanhope, esq. in the several stock ledger books of Turner and company, mentioned in the Appendix, under the following letters, viz. in the stock ledger book, letter A, fol. 99, and in the stock ledger, letter B, fol. 7, and 62. The entry in the ledger, letter A, is in these words on the debtor side.

account of all notes issued and paid by Turner and company are duly entered, it appeared by the note book, letter F, fol. 100, and by the cash note ledger, letter A, fol. 289, and 299, that upon the 11th of. June, 1720, one cash note of the said Turner and company was re- ' gulnrly made out for 202, 230/. payable to the said Mr. Charles Stanhope, and another cash note of Turner and company was also regularly made out the same day for 47, 770/. payable to Mr. Charles Stanhope, which last note in the note book, letter F, fol. 100, is entered, Robert Surman; both which notes were regularly entered, paid, and satisfied, unto Mr. Charles Stanhope, by Turner and company, upon the 12th of December, 1720, in the note book of Turner and company, letter G, fol. 70, and their cash note ledger, letter H, fol. 77, and by another book of Turner and company, called the drawing cash ledger, letter I, fol. 758, it appears, that upon the said 11th day of June, 1720, when the said notes were issued, the sum of 47, 77Cfl. being the pontents of one of the said notes, was charged to the account of Mr. Robert Surman, deputy cashier of the South Sea Company, as paid that day out of the cash kept by Turner and company, unto the order of the said Robert Surman; Robert Surman being examined thereunto, upon inspection of cash-draughts kept by Turner and company, in nis name, wherein it appears, that he is charged with the aforesaid sum of 47, 770/. paid by Turner and company, the 11th of June, 1720, out of the cash kept with them, by Mr. Knight, as cashier of the South Sea Company, and for which Surman was accountable to Knight, did verily believe, that the said sum, accordingly paia by them, by order of Mr. Knight, was given to the examinant out of the said cdsh, and was no part of the examinant’* proper cash.

Your Committee in this place observe, that the two sums of 202, 230/. and 47, 770/. amount to 250,000l. which being added to the 125,000l. the supposed price of the said 50,000l. stock, amounts to the whole sum charged in the said stock ledger, viz. 375,000/; as the produce of the said stock upon the 11th of June, 1720, and deducting out of the 375,000l. the sum of

125,000 for the prime cost of the said stock, there remains a clear difference of 250,000l. accruing to the person for whose benefit the 50,000l. stock was charged, as sold in the Company’s cash book, which is the exact amount of the said two cash noteSf-tnade payable to Charles Stanhope, esq. and accordingly entered, paid, and satisfied unto him, the 12tu of December, 1720.

In confirmation of which payment, it ap-

And this account was upon the same 11th of Jnne 1720, regularly entered in their book, called the general or clearing-book, letter C. fol. 110, and was placed to Charles Stanhope, esq. accordingly.

Daniel Watkins declared, that be at first wrote those several entries in the said book, in the name of Charles Stanhope, esq. by the direction of sir George Caswall, one of the copartners with Turner aod Sawbridge, or from some other account, and believed, that he had seeh the said Charles Stanhope, esq. at the office of Turner and company, once or oftener, in or about the months of May or June last, coming there to receive money, that he was then told Mr. ^Stanhope’s name by some clerk in the office, and upon his examination described Mr. Stanhope to be k tall thin man, of a black or brown complexion, according to his remembrance.

The said accounts mentioning 28,000l. stock, part of the said 50,000l. to be adjusted with Joseph Stokes at 172, 770/. your Committee sent for the said Joseph Stokes, and for Joseph Stanborough his partner, who acted for Turner and company, in the selling of stock, who being examined, and producing their account book, and comparing-it with an account in the said ledger of Turner and company; letter Dr fol. 86, kept with the said Joseph Stokes, for the produce of this 28,000l. stock, at 172, 770/. John Stanborough said, that he transacted*this affair for Mr. Sawbridge, and that the said 28,000l. South Sea stock, was sold, or disposed of by him or Joseph Stokes, upon the 10th of June, 1720, or a day or two before, together with another sum of 1,000l.

Your Committee examined John Mount and John Maddy; cashier to Turner and company, as well before as since the new co-partnership, Richard Fenton their book-keeper, and also Jacob Sawbridge, jun. son of Jacob Sawbridge, esq. the said Robinson Knight and Henry Blunt, who, before the 25tl» of June, 1720, were assistants in the office of Turner and company, relating to the several books and entries, and to the transactions therein contained; and John Mount, John Maddy, and Richard Fenton declared, that they verily believed, that all the said accounts and entries of receipts and payments, and of issuing and paying notes, were true; and that the respective suras rpentioned therein to have been received and paid, were really received and paid; and that the notes therein mentioned to have been issued, and paid, were actually issued and paid according to the import of the several entries; and that those two notes for 202, 230/. and 47, 770/. were actually issued, payable to Mr. Charles Stanhope, upon the 11th of June, 1720, in the usual and regular manner; the note for the 202, 230/. being entered and filled up by the said Henry Blunt, and the other note for 47, 770/. being entered and filled up by Jacob Sawbridge, jun. by the direction of Jacob Sawbridge, sen. esq. and both the said notes, signed by Robinson Knight, then entrusted by Turner and company to sign notes for them, as Jacob Sawbridge, jun. Robinson Knight, and Henry Blunt did acknowledge; and that Turner and company, did thereby become chargeable with the payment of the money mentioned in the, two notes, which were actually paid and satisfied upon the 12th of December, 1720, according, to the entries thereof, made in the same books out of the cash, amounting to 1, 166, 875/. 4s. Id. really paid and answered by Turner, Caswall and Sawbridge, into the new co-partnership, which Henry Blunt and Robin-, son Knight, the new co-partners, did likewise confess, and that the two notes being then discharged, were delivered up to Turner and company.

The Committee observing, that in the stock-ledger, book (A) and (B ), the name as it now stands at) the head of accounts there, and also in the accounts in the said book-ledger, letter (B) fob 7, is (Stangape, ’ although in the alphabets or indexes of the said books, referring to the true folios, the name still remains Stan- hope/ and also that in the said general or clearing book, the name now appearing in the account of the said 50,000l. stock, .is Stangape/

and that the said books had been razed, and the letters altered; did examine Jacob Sawbridge, esq. and Daniel Watkins, one of the clerks of Turner and company, upon the fact. Mr. Sawbridge acknowledged that the name at first entered in the said books was Stanhope/ and said it was entered in a fictitious name, that their servants might not know of it; that he gave directions to Daniel Watkins, about two months past, to make the several razures and alterations in the sir-name, and to turn it into ‘ Stangape/ but owned, that his name referred to the name Stanhope/ mentioned in the alphabets and in the other books, and that it meant the same person.

Being asked whether there was any other fictitious name made use of irr the books of Turner and company, besides the name Charles Stanhope or Stangape, esq. he said, that there was no other fictitious name in the whole book, to his knowledge.

Daniel Watkins being thereupon sent for,

and examined, did declare, that about the 14th day of December last, he made the several razures and alterations in the name Stanhope/ which was the name he had first wrote down in the books and altered the same to Stangape/ as it now appears, by the direction of sir George Caswall, who then told the examinant, that it was an anonymous name (as the examinant expressed it) and that it ought to have been ‘ Stangape ' at first; that Mr. Sawbridge was not present at that time, and believed Mr. Sawbridge did not know of it till afterwards; but Watkins likewise owned that there is nq other fictitious name in any of the said books.

Mr. Jacob Sawbridge attending in a room next adjoining, was called in again, after Watkins was withdrawn, and did then say; that upon recollecting himself, he desired sir George Caswall to give directions for the alterations.

But Mr. Robert Surman (who was well ac-‘ quainted with Turner and company, and had about two years since been a clerk to them) and the present cashiers and- clerks of Turner and company, viz. John Maddy, John Mount, and Richard Fenton, did ail of them declare, upon their examinations, that they never knew nor heard of any fictitious name made use of by Turner and company, in any of their books, and John Maddy, one of the cashiers, said, that in the nature of the affair, fictitious names could not be made use of.

Your committee thinking it might be of use to have a sight of the notes themselves, ordered John Maddy to search for them in the proper place, and to bring them before your committee. who being returned, acquainted them, that he had searched the files, kept for that purpose, at the office of Turner and company, and although he had foupd other notes, which were entered to be paid on the same 12th of December last, and upon other days before and after that day, preserved as usual upon the file, yet he could find neither of the said two notes; and that enquiring of Daniel Watkins, what was become of tha said notes, .he was informed

727] PARL. HISTORY, 7 Gbohcr I. 1721. — Fsrvf VrOc&dtkg* [723

by him, that he well remembered, that when he entered these two notes, paid the 12th of December last, he took them up and cancelled 'them, and that they being.much worn by having been carried in a pocket, he had destroyed them. The examinant said farther, that he did not know or remember that any other notes delivered up, had been destroyed.; but that the ‘method observed in their business, had been to tear off the name of the person signing them, and to preserve the notes upon a file kept for that purpose in the office of Turner and company.

Daniel Watkin* being thereupon examined, confessed, that the said two notes were delivered up to him, upon the 12th day of December 1720, by Jacob Sawbridge, esq. and that after he had examined them with the books, ' and found them to be of the same numbers, dates, and sum9, with such two notes then outstanding, he on the same 12th of December cancelled and destroyed them, and believed he burnt them, but had do direction so to do, his order from Jacob Sawbridge, esq. being to discharge them in the books, and that the only reason for his destroying them, was, because the files being removed out of their usual places, he could not find the proper files, whereon these notes ought to have been put, and also believing that no other person bad any property or interest therein, besides Turner,

, Caswall, and Sawbridge, to whose proper account he then had placed them.

Being asked, - if he ever had destroyed any other notes, delivered up-to Turner and company, upon payment thereof; he answered, that he could not remember that he had ever destroyed any other note, so delivered up; but that other notes, after they were so delivered, have been preserved upon files.

Henry Blunt said, that the note for 202, 230/. was filled up by himself, and being signed by Robinson Knight, was delivered to Jacob Sawbridge, esq. who immediately cancelled the said note, by tearing off the name of Robinson Knight, fearing (as the examinant supposed) that he might lose it, and then put the said cancelled note in his pocket, but the examinant did not know the reason of Mr. Sawbridge so tearing such notes.

Your committee hereupon cannot but observe the dangerous Consequence of such extraordinary acts of rasing and altering the name of a gentleman of distinction, in books belonging to a society of bankers and in an article of so very great value, and of the destroying these two notes, from the inspection, whereof, more full, and more direct evidence might have been laid before this House, especially considering that both these facts were committed after an enquiry into the proceedings of the directors of the South-Sea Company was begun by this House, and the raeure made in the account of books of stock was about the same time, when the general account of stock sold by the South-Sea Company was delivered into (his House, and.when the subsequent order

df this House, of the 17th of December last, was made, thqt the directors of the said Company should lay before this Hottse a particular account of the said 574, 500/. stock, sold by the said Company, with the respective prices and parcels, and the persons by whom it was sold; and by whom, and to whom transferred.

Your committee further observe, that Daniel Watkins upon his first examination, did not mention any thing concerning the property of this 50,000l. stock, although his examination did naturally lead thereunto; but upon his subsequent examination on another day, hb said, he believed this 50,000l. stock was bought by Turner and company, or one of them, of the South-Sea Company, or of Mr. Knight, for their proper accoaut, and directed to be entered in Mr. Stanhope’s name, to prevent their servants knowing that it was their own stock; but being asked what reason he. had for such his belief, he only answered, because he was ordered by Mr. Sawbridge, upon the 12th of December last, to place these notes to the proper account of Turner and company, and that from the nature of the account, and from Mr. Turner insisting to have credit for the 11,000l. South Sea Stock from the co-partnership, which he could not otherwise have, and from all the circumstances he bad any knowledge of, he could not find that any other person had any property therein.

Mr. Robert Surraan said, he remembered, that there was 50,000l. (which, be believed, was part of the 68,000l.) stock, mentioned in the cash-book to be sold the 21st of March, 1719, at 350/. per cent, sold to Turner and company; and before it was adjusted, sir George Caswell acquainted him with it, and left with kirn a cash-note for 125,000l. to be delivered to Mr. Knight, saying Mr. Knight knew what it meant, and: soon afterwards, the. s(ock was adjusted between Mr. Knight and sir George Caswall, and the fexaminant delivered the said note to Mr. Knight, and had, after that time, seen such cash note in Mr. Knight’* custody, but did not remember any thing of the payment of the said note.

Being shewn the entries before-mentioned, in the stock-ledgers, letter (A) and (B ), and the general or clearing-hook, letter (C ), he said those entfies imported Turner and company, their paying to the person therein named (Stanhope or Stangape) the money therein mentioned, the examinant having formerly been cleric to Turner and company, and negotiating their stock for them; He said moreover, be never knew or heard of the name (Stangape) till after Mr. Sawbridge’s examination, but knows Charles Stanhope, esq. of the treasury j and that about six, eight, or nine months before his examination, (which was upon toe 14th of January last) he had frequently seen him at the South-Sea bouse, and that he saw him them near two months past, and not since, at which several times, Mr. Stanhope and Mr. Knight were writing together, and seemed to be settling accounts.

729] PARL. HISTORY, 7 Geom* I.

-Upon Saturday the 21st day of January last, before noon, your committee Sent for Mr. Robert Knight the cashier, to examine bim particularly about this disposition of stock in the Company's cash-book, who said, that this 50,000l. was part of the 68,000l. stock, charged in the cash-book to be sold the 21st of March 1719, at 250/. per cent; that about that time he was ordered by thS sub and deputy-governors, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Chester, Mr. Hol-ditch, 'and sir John Blunt, to deliver this stock to Turner and company for their own use, (as he believed) and that about the latter end of May, 1720, (as he remembered) it wa9 delivered to them, by an adjustment of stock made with them, and that lie received the whole money of them, for such stock, at the price of 250/. per cent. He owned there was no agree* ment in writing made, nor any time limited, when the stock should be delivered, because the Company had not the stock at that time, hut Turner and company might call for it when the price was advanced to 750/. percent, upon paying 125,000l. and thereupon the stock was to be delivered without making any allowance to the Company for forbearance of payment. That EliaS Turner, sir George Caswall, and Jacob Sawbridge, were obliged in honour to pay the money, and to stand to the loss, if the stock had fallen, but that stock continued to rise, and was never under 250/. per cent, after this bargain.

Your Committee proceeding to examine Mr. Knight farther, concerning the disposal of the stock entered in the cash book in blank; and enquiring of him, from wheuce the account of stock then prepared by him, and intended to be laid before this House, was taken; he answered, That before he entered this stock in the cash book, he shewed the Sub and Deputy Governors, sir John Blunt, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Chester, and Mr. Ilolditch, upon a paper, the method in which he- proposed to enter, it, and had their approbation thereof, and in that paper, the several names of the persons who were to have the benefit of this stock were mentioned. That he disposed of about half of that stock, and put down the names of the persons to whom it was disposed of, and that the Sub and Deputy Governors disposed of some, and Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Chester, and sir John Blunt disposed of other ' parts, and gave him the names of the several persons to whom it was disposed of by them; that he had not seen that paper lor about six months, but made up an account of this stock to be laid before the Houses with t|ie particular hames, from his memory, and some letters, and by enquiry from several of the directors, brokers, and clerks, and that the 50,000l. stock to Turner and company was part of the stock ' which the directors disposed of. That the cash book was passed in blank by the Committee, and he believed that no objection was made to it, nor any such reason given, as that the persons names were not proper to be made public at that time; and denied chat he said, ; hat if the bill pasted, the Stock would be well disposed

1721« — of the South Sea Company, [780

of; but owned, that he did not think it proper to enter the names of the members of parliament who had any part of this stock in the cash book; and that it was the general opinion of the gentlemen then. present, that it was not proper the names should be mentioned; and he said, that suck members did not know that it was the Company’s stock; that the names of all the members of parliament, who had part of this stock, are not set down in this account framed by him, because he Was not certain who the persons were; tjiat it was declared by the directors, that the Sub and Deputy Governors should have the care of the scheme, with a liberty of taking to their assistance such others of the directors as they should think fit.

Mr. Knight being here pressed to produce his letters and papers, and to declare more particularly, what he knew oi the disposition of this stock, desired leave to attend the House of Peers, according to their order, the time appointed being come, and not having his papers in readiness then. YoUr Committee intending to proceed farther in his examination on the Monday following, and to give him time to collect his papers and accounts, did thereupon permit him to go to Westminster; but Mr. Knight withdrawing himself that' Saturday evening, prevented any discovery of this irn-, portant affair from his farther examination.

Your Committee farther represent, that they have discovered great dealings in South-Sea stock by John Aislabie, esq. with one broker, Matthew Weymohdsold, and which account is annexed to this report, No. III.

And your Committee finding that Turner, Caswall, and company, had great transactions with the South-Sea Company, upon farther inspection of their books, among other remarkable passages in the said books, they fonnd very great sums of money received by Turner and company, for the account of Edmand Waller, esq. (son-in-law of John Aislabie, esq. late Chancellor of the Exchequer) and paid out to him, or his order, between the 28th day of March last, and the 21st day of November following, amounting to 794, 451/. 15s. 9 and your Committee also found a considerable quantity of South-Sea stock bought and sold ip the name of the said Mr; Waller; and in the general accounts of stock of Turner and company, it appears, that there was a balance of 77, 600/. due to the said Mr. Waller from Turner and company; fur securing which sum, Turner and company entered into bonds the 26th of November last, for 12 months, from the 24th of September then past; that is to sav, one bond for 44, 6^0/. to the said Edmund Waller, and one other bond to Thomas Weddell, esq. for 33,000l. Whereupon your Committee ordered Mr. Waller, ana Mr. Weddell, to attend them: but they bare not, as yet, had an opportunity of examining Mr. Waller, by reason of his indisposition; but Mr. WedtfeH* attending your'Committee was examined, and did inform them, that about the Ond of October, or beginning of November fast, Mr. Wab»

731] PAUL. HISTORY, 7 George I. 1721. — First Report bn the Proceedings[732

ler desired him to take in 10,0001. South-Sea stock for him, and in three days afterwards told him, he had accordingly transferred it to the examinant, and desired him to go to Turner and company, and gave them a defeazance for transferring that stock upon their paying 33,000l. That the examinant did accordingly accept a transfer of the said 10,000l. stock from Mr. Waller, and gave a defeazance for transferring that stock to Turner and company, who gave the examinant their bond for payment of the said 33,000l. That Mr. Waller acquainted the examinant, that this was in trust for John Aislabie, esq. and he was afterwards told so by Mr. Aislabie himself, and says, that he has Turner and company’s bond for the said 33,000l. which is the proper money of Mr. Aislabie; but Mr. Waller’s indisposition has prevented your Committee from laying before the House in this report, a mere fall account relating to the sum of 794, 451/. 15s. 9 before-mentioned.1

Here your committee must observe, that in the account of stock sold, laid before this House, they found the names of several members of this House and of the House of Peers, not concerned in the administration, or in the management of the public revenue, whose cases your committee could not particularly examine, but must wait for the consideration and direction of the House, in what manner each examination shall proceed. In the mean time, your committee think it proper to acquaint the House, with divers practices made use of to raise the nominal value of South-Sea stock, to that extravagant rate to which it was afterwards advanced, above the real and intrinsic value thereof.

% Your, committee find, that by computation made bydirection of your committee it appears, that the directors of the South-Sea Company, might have raised the whole sun^ stipulated for the public, with a profit of near one million and an half for the benefit of the proprietors of the old stock, without setting their stock to sale at any higher price than 150/. per cent.

That after the said directors had taken in the first money-subscription at 300/. per cent, and the second money-subscription at 400/. per cent, and the first subscription of the long and short annuities at 375/. per cent, the value' of 100/. South-Sea stock was but 120/. or thereabouts, supposing the whole money of the said first and second subscriptions (amounting to 12, 750,000l.) had been all paid in.

That the said court of directors did afterwards proceed to take in a third and fourth money-subscription at the rate of 1,000l. per «jpot. and a second subscription of the long and short annuities, and a subscription of the re* deemable debts at the rate of 800/. per cent, after which the value of 100/. South-Sea stock was but 332Z. or thereabouts, supposing the whole money of the said four money-subscriptions (amounting to 68, 750,000l.) had been all paid in.

That if all the remaining public debts had been taken in, apd. all the remaining stocks of

the Company sold, on the terms which the said directors pretended to expect, 100/. South-Sea stock would have been worth but 547/. or thereabouts, supposing the money of the said four subscriptions, and the money for the remain* ing stock, (which together would have amounted to 205, 039, 401/.) had been all paid in.

That on the 30th day of August last, the court of directors of the South-Sea Company came to a resolution (which on the 8tb day of September last was confirmed by a general court) to declare a dividend of 30/. per cent, to be made at Christmas, 1720, and of not less than 50/. per cent, per ana. for not less than 12 years to come from that time.

That soon after this Resolution, (viz. at a general court held the 20th day of September last) the sub-goveruor acquainted the general court, that the affairs of the court, in relation to the price of their stock, and subscriptions, had taken an unexpected turn, and thereupon proposed their giving a power to the court of directors to relieve the last subscribers of the public debts, ^and the proprietors of the two last money-subscriptions, which was accordingly granted; and at a court of directors held the 29th day of September last, it was resolved, that the said subscribers should have the same terms with the Bank, viz. that their subscriptions should be reduced from 1,000l. and 800/.

Eer cent, to 400/. and that they should also, avethe benefit of the Midsummer dividend of 10/. per cent, which was.accordingly confirmed by a general court held the 30th day of the same month; upon which your committee observe that it appears to them very extraordinary that the directors on the 8th day of September (when the said high dividend was der dared in a general court) should have had no foresight of the turn which so soon after (viz. on the 20th day of the same month) happened in their affairs.

That on the said 8th day of September, the sub-governor acquainted the general court, that their directors bad been unanimous in all their proceedings, which among other things, includes the before-mentioned several subscriptions by them taken in, except the first; and upon the examination of the directors it doth not appear to your committee that any one of them protested against, or declared any public dissent from any of the said proceedings: and it appears that all of them took their shares and proportions of the subscriptions, which were allotted for the respective directors to dispose of.

And your committee have been informed by sir Theodore Janssen, that there was a meeting at the house of sir John Fellows, betwixt sixteen of the court of directors, Mr. Secretary Craggs, and Mr. Aislabie, at which time it was proposed, that a subscription should be taken in at 300/. per cent, which was approved of by Mr. Secretary Craggs, and Mr. Aislabie; ana that, when the said company broke up, it was agreed, that every person should use their best endeavour* to promote d; which is also coa-

733] PARL. HISTORY, 7 George I. 1721_of the South Sea Company. [734

firmed by the information of sir Lambert Blackwell.

And at a court of directors, held the 13th day of April last, it was resolved, to take in a subscription for two. tnillioqs, at the rate of 300/. per cent, but the; same was afterwards increased, without any previous resolution to that purpose, to 2, 250,000l. and your committee observe that the imaginary value of the said subscriptions rose very fast; and that those who had the benefit of the said additional subscription, if they sold, and disposed of the same, made very great gains thereby.

That at a court of directors held the 28th day of April last, it was resolved to take in a second money-subscription, at the rate of 400/. per cent, for 1,000,000l. but by the accounts delivered into this House, it appears, that the Said subscription was for 1, 500,000l. yet it.does not appear that there was any previous Resolution of the court of directors for the addition of 500, 00b/. nor was the said addition declared till the 8th of Sep tender last, at which time the sub-governor acquainted the general court therewith; upon which your committee cannot but observe the great distance of time between the taking in of the second subscription at 1,000,000l. and the 8th of September, when the same was reported'to the general court at 1, 500,000l. during which interval the imaginary value of that subscription was excessively increased, whereby the persons who had the same, had the advantage of that extraordinary rise.

That at a court of directors, held the 15th day of June last, it Was resolved to take in a third money-subscription at the rate of 1,000l. per cent. one tenth part whereof was to be paid down at the time of subscription; and at a court of directors held the 23d day of the same month, the sub-governor acquainted the court, that the said third money subscription was completed, without mentioning to what sum: but at the before-mentioned general court, held the 8th day of September last, he declared the same to be for live millions; and Mr. Knight, late cashier of the South Sea Company, by an article dated the 20th day of June, last, in the cash-book, fol. 125, charges the said sum of live millions as received; which account was passed, and allowed by the Company's committee of treasury, on, or some time after, the4th day of August last; and yet in the account of the third money-subscription delivered into this House, it is staged at 4, 400,000l. only, the remaining sum of600,000l. being entered on the credit side of the said cash-book on the 19th of December, 1720, as a supposed deficiency of the payment on this subscription; although it appears to your committee upon the evidence of Mr.. Lockyer and others, that not only the whole sum of five millions, but even a considerable exceeding thereon was paid in; that a great deal of money was repaid back to reduce the subscription to five millions; and that they had money enough paid in for near eight millions.

That at a court of directors, held the 12 th day of August last, it was resolved to take in a fourth money-subscription for one million, at the rate of 1,000l. per cent. And at a court of directors, held the 25th of the same month, it was declared, that upon casting up the books, it was found the s, aid fourth money-subscription, instead of one million, was increased to 1, 250,000l. which was occasioned by taking the said subscription in several books; and at the beforementioned general court, held the8th day of September last, the subrgovernor declared the fourth money-subscription was com-pieated to 1, 250,000l. and Mr. Knight the cashier hath, in an article dated the 30th day of August last, and entered in the cash-book, fol. 128, given the Company credit for the first payment, made on the 4tn subscription, vis. for 2, 500,000l. which account was passed, ao<t allowed by the committee of treasury, on the 4th day of October last; and yet in the account of the said fourth money subscription delivered into thi£ House, it is stated ac 1, 200,000/: only:That upon the examination of Mr. Knight, and several of the directors, in relation to the deficiency of the said third and fourth money-subscriptions, their answers were very unsatisfactory: And your committoecan-not but observe, that as by the before-mentioned additions to the first two money-subscriptions, some persons made great gains, whilst the price of the.said subscriptions continued high, so when the price of the subscriptions fell, many other persons were favoured, by having their subscriptions withdrawn, '* which was the cause of the deficiency.

That on the second money-subscription each director was allowed for himself and friends, 26,000l. and that the remainder of the million at first resolved to be taken in, was at the disposal of the sub and deputy governors; but for whose benefit the additional subscription of 500,000l. was intended, your committee have not yet been able to discover.

That on the third money-subscription each director was allowed 54,000l. for himself and friends, and that several large lists of thenatnea of persons were sent to the sub-governor, to t be admitted into the said third subscription;

1 viz. by the earl of Sunderland, first lord commissioner of the treasury, a list amounting. to 167,000l. By John Aislabie, esq. late chancellor of the exchequer, another of the lords of the treasury, a list amounting to 75, 300/. By James Craggs, esq. one of his majesty’s principal secretarierof state, two lists, amounting to 695,000l. and by Charles Stanhope, esq. one of the secretaries of the treasury, a list amounting to 49, 700/. which four last mentioned lists amount to 987,000l.

That upon examination, it appears, that other lists have been given in, as well on the third as on the second subscription; but the same being lost or mislaid, as your committee have been informed, they ere thereby disabled at present, from making any report thereon.

They find 25,000l. of the second subscript

tion bath been given unto John Aislabie, esq. about eight or ten days after the opening of that subscription, at which time'the subscriptions were at an advanced price, of about 40/. per cent, and soon after rose vastly higher.

That it doth not appear to your committee that any of the persons, who had the honour to serve his majesty in the treasury, or any other part of the administration, used any endeavours to prevent the directors of the South-Sea Company from taking in subscriptions at the aforesaid extravagant prices; but, on the contrary, it doth appear, that some of them, by the lists they gave in aforesaid, did not only encourage and promote the said subscriptions, But did greatly enlarge the same.

Your committee observing that sir John Fellows, late sub governor of the South-Sea Cora-pany^did at a general court of the said Company, held the 21st day of April, 1720, acquaint that court, that the design of the government's million of Exchequer bills to be lpnt to the Company, by virtue of the late act of parliament for issuing Exchequer bills, to be circulated at or near the Exchequer, was to enable the Company to lend money upon their stock; raid finding that by order of the court of directors of the said Company the same had been so leot out, your committee proceeded to enquire into this affair.

And on examination of Mr. Robert Knight, late cashier of the said Company, he declared, that he did not remember that any application was made by the directors to have those bills issued; but that the first discourse of this matter was by John Aislabie, esq. then chancellor of the exchequer, a week before the proposals of the South-Sea Company were offered to this House; that Mr. Aislabie. said, it would be more acceptable to have those bills circulated at the Exchequer, than to send them to the Bank or elsewhere, and that the company might' afford to circulate them for nothing, they being to be lent to the Company to enable them to execute their scheme. That the examinant believed, the intention of lending the said bills upon stock, had been communicated to Mr. Aislabie, (and that be the examinant) on his attending at the treasury to solicit the issuing of these bills, did mention that design, and never heard that the treasury disapproved of it.

That sir John Blunt declared, it would be beljcr to employ those bills in the lending upon stock, than in paying off the redeemables, which would take up mom time.

Hereupon your committee examining sir John Fellows, be said, that be and others of the directors treated with Mr. Aislabie and others at the treasury, about the issuing the said Exchequer bills; but that it was first proposed to Mr. Aislabie, end the examinant believed, it was at first mentioned by sir John Blunt, in a committee of the directors, nod that it was the general opinion of the directors.

Yosr cmmmtMe examining eir John Blunt upon this transection, be declared, that be spoke to Mr. AisMbif to hasten the issuing of the

said bills; and that himself, or some other of the directors acquainted Mr. Aislabie, as be believes at the treasury, with the Company’s design to lend them upon stock; that it did not, at first, arise from the directors, but that it was intimated tp them before, or very soon after the Company’s proposals were laid before the House, by some of the treasury, and on recollection, the examinant said it was by Mr. Aislabie, to enable the Company to carry on their scheme, and thereby to raise the price of their 6tock, the borrowers being enabled to buy stock..

That by the book of loans delivered into this House, it appears that the% sum of 9, 039, 936/. lls. was lent to several persons o* the security of 2, 563, 117/. 17s. bd. stock: and that the farther sura of 2, 219, 089/. was lent on the security of 773, 600/. subscription-receipts; the money so lent, and still remaining due, amounting in the whole to the sum of 11, 259, 025/. 11s..

That by several resolutions of the court of directors of the 21st of April, the 20th of May, and the 9th of June last, for three several loans, it appears, that the sum resolved by them to be lent on stock from the 21st of April, to the 21st of May, was limited to 500,000l. in the whole, and that not more than 5,000l. should be leot to any one person, and such loan to be only at the rate of 250/. on 100/. stock; that from the 20th of May to the 9th of June, the rule of lending was at the rate of 300/. on 100/. stock, and that not more than 3,000l. should be leot to any one person; and from the 9th of June, the rule of lending was at 400/. on 100/. stock, and that not more than 4,000l. should be lent to any one person.

That on examination of the book of loans, it appears, that on the first loan, the roles of lending were greatly exceeded, viz. That there was lent in the whole 943, 631/. more than the sum of 590,000l. to which the said loan was confined. That the excess above 250/. on 100/. stock, amounts to 316, 740/. and the excess above 5,000l. to one person, amounts in the whole to 779, 231/. That on the second Joan the exoess above the rate of 300/. on 100/. stock amounts to 30, 750/. and the excess above 3,000l. to one person, asnouDts in the whole to 169, 025/. And that on the third loan, the excess above 400/. on 100/. stock amounts to 59, 413/. and the excess above the rate of 4,000l. no one person, amounts in the whole, to 1, 447, 677/. For the particulars of aU which, tyour committee refer to the book marked No. 4, in which the same are distinctly expressed, and the resolutions of the general court, and court of -directors, in relation to loans, are transcribed.

That your committee do not find any resolution, either of a general court, or a court of directors, for lending money on subscription-receipts; but by the examinations which they have taken, it appears that Mr. Knight, 1W late cashier of the South-Sea Company, and his under cashier and clerks, -by his directions *

did lend money on the subscription-receipts, by. venbal orders from; the directors of the said, company, and under colour of an order of a general court, made the 21st of Apri] 1720, to empower the court of directors from time to time, as they shall see for the interest of the company, to lend any sum or sums of the com* pany’s money, on the company's present, and to be increased, capital stock; and to do all speh matters and things, as they should judge most for the good of the company.

But your committee find, that by the second by-law of the said company, relating to the keeping the cash of the company, it was ordained* that the cash of the corporation should from, time to time be kept under three several locks, with different wards, the keys of which to be kept, one by the cashier, and the other two by such of the governor, sub-governor, deputy-governor, or directors, as the said court should from time tq time appoint, except such sura or sums as the court of directors should think necessary to let remain in the custody of the cashier; and no money relating to the trade or affairs of the said company should be disposed of, without an order of the said dourt of directors; and that the interest and all other advantages, arising and growing* upon the cash of the said company, should be brought to the account of the said company. However, it appears that the said loans on subscriptions were generally known, and never objected against; by any of the directors in a general court, or in any court of directors.

That on the said loans on stock, the-stock was transferred to persons for that purpose nominated, in the same manner as if the same bad been absolutely sold, without any defeazance on the part of the company, qr of the persons to whom the stock was transferred, for retransferring the same, on repayment of the jnoney, nor w'as hny covenant or other security taken, for repayment from the borrowers, except the stock so transferred; nor doth there appear any distinction between the said transfers on loans, and the other transfers, which were made of stock absolutely purchased, on account of the company; upon which your committee observe, that it was io the power of the persons to whom the said pawned stock was transferred, to dispose thereof at any time, as they thought fit, when the price of stock was high, and to replace the same when it fell.

And your Committee do find, that on the 19th day of October last, the said Mr. Knight, to whom the said pawned stock was transferred, did, pursuant to an order of the Court of Directors, transfer stock to the amount of 2, 141, 867/. 17s. 5 d.to sir Harcourt Masters, col. Hugh Raymond, Edward Gibbon, and John Gore, -trustees, for that purpose, nominated by the Court of Directors, in whose names the same now remains; but the sum is 421, 250/. short of the aforesaid sum of 2, 563, 117/. 17*. 5d. which is mentioned in the said book of loans, to have been pledged for the security of the repayment of the aforesaid sum of 9, 039, 930/. VOL. VII.

1721 .--of the South Sea Company, [738

11s. from which it is evident, that the said sum of 421, 250/. of the stock mortgaged or pawned on loans, as aforesaid, has been sold, or otherwise disposed of, by the trustees, or agents of the South Sea Company; and till replaced, cannot be re-transferred to those, by whom the same '

' was pawned or mortgaged: Upon which your ' Committee observe, how easy it was for the trustees, of the company to have sold the said stock when it was at high prices, and to have replaced the same again when it fell; for on examination it appears, that there was no. distinct and separate account kept of the said mortgaged and pawned stock, nor was the same any ways distinguished from the other stock of those persons, to whom it was at first transferred.

* That as .to the said sum of 2, 219, 087/. lent on 773, 600/. subscriptionjreceipts, 'it appears by 'the aforesaid book of loans, that the general rule of lending was at the rate of 300/. on 100 subscription receipts; hut excluding from the said loans on subscriptions the two great loans, the one to the million-bank, and the other to Turner and company, the loans, to the other borrowers, will at qn average come out above 300 per cent. It appears that on the first subscription receipts, at the time of the. said lending, there was paid in only from 90/. to 120/. per cent, and on the second subscription receipts generally 40/. and on some few 80/. per cent, but how much more there hath been paid in since, or whether all the said subscription receipts, on which money was lent, be now remaining in the custody of any person for the security of the company, your Committee cannot at present discover; , the receipts nothav- v ing been as yet produced to them.

That it appears that Turner and company were employed by the directors, to lend oat' 500,000l. on subscription receipts, and that they accordingly lent 150,000l. on such receipts, after the rate of 190/. per cent, on the first subscription, and 40/. per cent, on the second. But such rates being by the said directors thought too low, the said Turner and company were ordered to proceed no farther in disposing of the remaining part of the said 500,000l. and were told at the same time, that by lending at such low rates on subscriptions, they were ruining the stock. And it also appear ^, that Mr. Knight did issue a considerable sutn to be disposed of by. brokers, for the refusal of South Sea stock .at certain times, at very high prices; and likewise, that on the declension of the price of the stock, large suras were issued to purchase atock on account of the company, at very high prices; add part of the stock then bought, appears to have-belonged to some of the directors of the said company: and although your Committee are not yet prepared to set thus matter in a full light, they cannot but observe, (that the said directors, in all their proceedings' in the execution of their scheme, appear to have had chiefly in view the raising ana supporting the imaginary value of the stock, at an extravagant and high price, for

Di

the benefit of themselves, and whose who were in the secret with them.

That as to the aforesaid loans-on subscription receipts, it appears, there were no defeazances executed by those with whom the veceipts were deposited, for a re-delivery of the same, on repayment of the money, nor any security given by the borrowers, besides the receipts by them so delivered; nor doth anything else appear to distinguish thereceipts so pledged, from -such receipts as were, or might have been, absolutely sold to the .company; for all the said receipts were made out iu one name, viz. Joseph Safford, and by his indorsement the bearer became intitled to the property thereof; upon which your Committee observe, the security of the company, as to the money lent on the said subscription receipts, is more precarious than the loans on stock; for by the transfer book it might appear by whom such stock was •transferred; but it hath not yet appeared to your Committee that any books have been kept, or-entries made, of the names of the persons to whom such loans have been made on subscription receipts: and your Committee do farther observe, that it was in the power of the persons ', tfith whom such subscription receipts were deposited, td sell the same at high prices, and to replace them again when the price fell. And upon the whole it doth appear to yourCommit-tee that the said loans on stock and on subscriptions have been managed with the utmost negligence, with respect to the interest of the company, and were contrived for the raisipg and keeping up the price of stock at an extravagant height.

Before your Committee conclude this report, they think it proper to observe, that ‘ it has appeared to them throughout their examination, thatrMr. Knight, cashier of the South Sea Company, was principally concerned in their most Secret transactions. And your Committee have been informed by sir Theodore Janssen, soon after Mr. .Knight’s withdrawing himself, that upon his pressing Mr. Knight, Iwo or three days before he went away, to make a discovery of whatsoever he knew relating to the whole proceedings; Mr. Knight answered, that if he should disclose all he knew, it would open such a scene as the world would be surprized at.

Your Committee having made this progress in their enquiry, have thought themselves obliged to lay this report before the House; and will proceed in' their farther examination of the matters referred to them, with the utmost diligence.

To this First Report was annexed an Appendix, the most material parts of which are, as follow:

Robert Surman also did confess, that those entries did import, and might be understood as explained above by John Maddy; this examinant and Mr. Knight having used to subscribe, and deliver out such notes ', for South-Sea stock to be accordingly delivered; but said, that such entries might likewise imply, that the person, named Charles Stangape, had notes for stock to that value, given by Turner and company t6 the examinant, and to Robert Knight; which

741] PARL. HISTORY, 7 George I. 1721. .• [742

sort of notes Mr. Knight frequently accepted from Turner and company, and delivered out as stock, instead of making actual transfers.

The said Report was ordered to be printed, and taken into consideration, on the 18th instant.

Resolutions of the Commons on the Petition of the S.mth-Sea Company.] Feb. 17. The Commons, in a committee of the whole House, considered of the king's Message relating to the South-Sea Company’s Petition, and came to the following Resolutions, viz. l.“That the payment of the. sum of 4, 15G, 306/. 4s. lid, due to the public, by the South-Sea Company, by virtue of the Act of the last session of parliament, and made payable within oneyear, by four quarterly payments, commencing the 25th March, 1721, be farther postponed to the year 1722; and that farther provision be made for the more effectual payment thereof. 2. That the repayment of the sum of 1,000,000, which was lent to the South-Sea Company, on the 7th of June, 1720, be postponed to the 7th June 1722.” — These Resolutions were agreed to by the House; and it was thereupon ordered, that it be an instruc-sion to the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Ingrafting Bill was committed, that they have power to receive a clause or clauses pursuant to the said Resolutions.

, Resolutions of the Commons on the First Report of the Committee of Secrecy.] Feb. 18; The Serjeant at Arms was ordered to summon the paembers in the. places adjacent, to attend the service of the House, why then proceeded to take the Report from the Committee of Secrecy into consideration; and after some speeches on the several parts of it, the House came unanimously to the several following Resolutions, nt(m. con.

“ 1. That the late sub-governor, deputy governor, and directors of the South Sea Company, and their officers, and their aiders and abettors, in lending out the Company’s money, opon stock and subscriptions, without taking sufficient security for repayment thereof, have been guilty of a notorious breach of trust, and have thereby occasioned great loss to the Company, for which they ought to make satisfaction OUt«f their own estates, v

“ 3. That the selling or disposing of stock, or subscriptions transferred or deposited, as a security for the repayment of the money so lent, was a notorious breach of the trust reposed in the said sub-governor, deputy governor, directors, and their officers, and a fraud on the proprietors, in order to enriqh themselves, for which, they ought to make satisfaction out of their own estates.

“ 3. That the taking in or holding of stock . by the South Sea Company, for the benefit of any member of either House of Parliament, Or person concerned in the administration, (during the time that the Company’s proposals, or the bill thereto relating, were depending in

parliament) without any valuable consideration paid, or sufficient security given for the acceptance of, or payment for such stock; and the Company’s paying or allowing such persoq the difference arising by the advanced price of the stocks, were corrupt, infamous, and dangerous practices, and highly reflecting on the honour and justice of parliaments, and destructive of, the interest of his majesty’s government.

“ 4. That any of the Directors of the South Sea Company, selling their own stock at high, prices, to the Company or others, at the same time that they gave orders for buying stock upon account of the Company, under pretence of keeping up the nominal value of the said stock, was a scandalous practice, tending to inrich themselves, to the great loss and detriment of the Company, and of others of his majesty’s subjects, for which they ought to make satisfaction out of their own estates.

“ 5. That the declaring a dividend of 30 per cent, for Christmas last, and not less than 50 per cent, per annum for not less than 12 years after, was an infamous contrivance to give his majesty’s subjects false notions of the value of the said stock, that the late directors might more easily dispose of their own stock at exorbitant prices.

“ 6. That the setting the stock of the South Sea Company to sale, by subscriptions at high prices, above the intrinsic value of the same, by the la, te sub-governor, deputy governor, and directors of the said Company, was a gross and notorious fraud, and has been one great cause of the sinking of the public credit, and bringing upon the nation the disr tress it at present labours under.

“ 7. That the advising the lute sub-governor, and directors of the South Sea Company, to set the stock of the said Company to sale by subscriptions at high and extravagant prices, or to declare the high and extravagant dividends for Christmas last, and 12 years after, by any persons in the administration, was a notorious breach of the trust reposed ip them, to the prejudice of his majesty’s government, and the interest of this kingdom.”

Then the farther consideration of the said Report was adjourned to the 21st following, wheo, after some time spent therein, the Commons came to the further unanimous Resolutions that follow:

* 8. That the entry ip the cash-book of the South Sea company of574, 500/. stock pretended to be sold for 1, 213, 575/. between the 4th of February, 1719, and the 12 th of April following, wps contrived with a design to conceal the names of persons, for whose benefit stock wae taken in by the said Company.

“ 9. That every person for whom stock was taken in or held, such stock being part of the ' 574, 500/. pretending to be sold by the South Sea Company, from the 4th day ot February* 1718, to the 12th day of April following, without money paid, or sufficient security given, for the acceptance of, and payment for such stock, be obliged to pay to die said Company

all such sums of money as have been received by way of difference, or otherwise, for such stock taken in or held as aforesaid.

* 10. That the addition of 250,000l. to the first mouey subscription, after it had been declared to have been opened for twrf millions, ' and the addition of 500,000l. to the second money subscription, after it had been declared to be opened for one million, were fraudulently contrived to give corrupt advantages to particular persons, and were injurious to public credit.

“ 11. That a Bill be brought in for the relief of the unhappy sufferers in the South Sea Company.”

Second Report of the Committee of Secrecy on the Proceedings of the South Sea Company.] Feb. 25. Mr. Brodrick, Chairman of the Committee of Secrecy, acquainted the Commons, That the Committee, since their former Report, had come to a farther knowledge of some matters therein mentioned; and were ready to lay a farther Report before the House, , at such time as the House should appoint to receive the same. Hereupon it was ordered, That the Report be now received. Mr. Brodrick accordingly read the same Report in his place, and afterwards delivered it in at the table, where the same was again read, and is as follows:

Second Report of tub Committee of Secrecy on the Proceedings of the South Sea Company.

The Committee of Secrecy, appointed to inquire into all the Proceedings relating to the Execution of the Act, parsed the last session of parliament, intitled, “ An Act for enabling the South Sea Company to increase their present capital stock and fund, by redeeming such public debts and incumbrances as are therein mentioned; and for raising'money, to be applied for lessening several of the public debts and incumbrances; and for calling in the present Exchequer Bills remaining uncaucelled; and for making forth new bills, in lieu thereof to be circulated and exchanged, upon demand, at or near the Exchequer; 2* have made some further progress in the matters referred to them:

Upon the Examination of Mr. Matthew Wymondesold, broker, and of John Falcon-bridge, his book-keeper, touching the particulars of stock bought by Wymondesold, for John Aislabie, esq. late Chancellor of the Exche-

Jjuer, specified in the Account annexed to the ormer Report of your Committee, it appears, That, amongst other great sums, in stock, bought by Wymondesold on Mr. Aislabie’s account, the sum of 20,000l. South Sea stock, was, on the 12th of Feb. 1719, delivered to Mr. Wymondesold, by Mr. Robert Surman, than deputy-cashier of the South Sea Com- pany, by order of Mr. Hawes, at the rate of 190/. per cent, fop the use of Mr. Aisfobie;

which was about 40 per cent, below the market price, as appears by the account of stock sold, laid before the House. '

Upon this your Committee sent for Mr. Hawes, and examined him as to this 20,000l. stock. He said, He remembered, that Mr. Wymondesold applied to him for this 20,000l. stock; and the examinant told him, He had no orders for the delivering such stock:but the examinant could not remember whether he went to Mr. Aislabie, and had his directions to send Mr. Wymondesold to Mr. Surman; or whether he the examinant, did nbt tell Mr. Wymondesold to go to Mr. Surman for it. But that if'he did send him to Mr. Surman he had Mr. Aislabie’s directions for that Jjurpose.

John Falconbridge'mformed your Committee, That, on the 9th of February 1719, he did take in the said 20,000l. stock of Mr. Surman, for Mr. Aislabie’s use at 130/. per cent.; and that the examinant, on the 12th of the same month, wrote off this stock from Mr. Surraan’s to Mr. Aislabie’s account. But your Committee ex- amining Mr. Surman as tQ this natter, he said, He did not remember his transferring the said stock; but said, That he bad a great quantity of stock, in his name, intrust for Mr. Knight, and transferred the same on verbal orders only; and that this 20,000l. (if it was transferred) 'was transferred by Mr. Knight’s directions.

Your Committee also found, on the examination of the said Mr. Wymondesold, and John Faulconbridge, that several parcels of South Sea stock, amounting to 20,000l. stock, were bought by Mr. Weymondsold for Mr. Aislabie, on the 1st of March, 1719, at several prices, amounting in the whole to 35, 357/. 10s. And that Mr. Knight, late cashier of the South Sea company, paid the examinant the money for such stook, and placed the same to Mr. Aislabie’s account. Mr. Weymondsold produced to your committee a letter from Mr. Aislabie to him, dated the 1st of March 1719, whereby he-directs Mr. Weymondsold to buy this 20,000l. stock, and adds, that he would desire Mr. Knight to pay him the money for the said stock; which letter, the examinant said, is of the haudwriting of Mr. Aislabie, and was received by the examinant oh the said 1st of March; and the examinant returned an answer to Mr. Aislabie the same day. . That on the 4th of March last, Mr. Knight adjusted the said stock with the examinant, who delivered the stock to Mr. Knight for the use of Mr. Aislabie, and Mr. Knight paid the examipant the money for such stock.

John Faulconbridge (who was concerned in entering and making out the accounts kept of this stock) being examined, said, that about a fortnight since, and after Mr. Weymondsdd’s first examination before the House of Peers, and his delivering in an account of stock bought for Mr. Aislabie, to your Committee, Mr. Aislabie requiridg the particulars of the stock bought and sold for him by Mr. Weymondsold, the examinant, by Mr, Weymon4 *

I

745] PAUL. HISTORY, 1 Ceorcb I.

sold, directions, attended Mr Aislabie with the particulars thereof: That Mr. Aislabie then objected against the said 20,000l. stock bought the 1st of March, and with execrations not fit to be repeated, declared, he knew nothing of it; and bid the examinant tell Mr. Weymond-sold, That he (Mr. Aislabie) must declare the same upon oath at the bar of the House. The examinant then told him, that he happened to object against an article, which was the plainest in his account, for that this very 20,000l. stock was taken in for him, and paid for by Mr. Knight; v and that the examinant had shewn the same article to Mr. Waller, (Mr. Aislabie’s son-in* law) in an account made up and settled with Mr. Knight long since, which Mr. Waller (who was then present) said was true; and the ex* aminant, the next day, attending Mr. Aislabie with an explanation of the account, on sight of it, Mr. Aislabie expressed himself thus, viz. Ay, this makes it plainer; now 1 can recollect something of it. (

The said Mr. Weymondsold farther informed your Committee, that there were dealings between Mr. Aislabie and Mr. Knight; and that the examinant had seen a green book in Mr. Knight’s custody, wherein the account of Mr. Aislabie was kept; which green book your Committee apprehended to be the same book, mentioned in the examination of Mr. Surmah, taken notice of in their former report.

Mr. Hawes farther acquainted your Committee, that be bad dealings in stock with Mr. Aislabie for a considerable time, and kept an ' account of the same in a book, of which Mr. Aislabie bad a duplicate. That the accounts in the said books was continued till some time in November last; and that upon every adjustment, Mr. Aislabie and the examinant usually signed each others books; that (among other things) the said books contained account of quantities of South Sea stock bought and sold by the examinant for Mr. Aislabie. That, some time in November last accounts were finally settled and adjusted between them; and thereupon the examinant was ordered by Mr. Aislabie, to bring the book, which the examinant was unwilling to do, saying, that he ought to keep it for his own justification. But Mr. Aislabie told him, that the accounts being then tnade up between them, he would have the book up, that nobody else might see it. And Mr. Aislabie gave £he examinant a receipt in full of all demands, and the examinant delivered him the book. Mr. Hawes farther said, that he never was desired so bo do, nor ever did the like to any person ftith whom he had dealing of this nature.

Your Committee have been informed by Mr.. Robert Surman, that several sums of money were paid out of the Company’s cash to John Aislabie, esq. and by the book of draughts, kept by the South Sea company, and the Bank, and also by the said Mr. Surman’s examination, your Committee find that on the 8th of April, i 7 20, a bill for 27, 878/. 19s. 6d. was drawn by Mr- Knight, then Cashier of the South Sea cora-

721*of. the South Sea Company. [746

pany, upon the Bank of England, payable to the said Mr. Aislabie, and the entry of that bill v in the cash draught book has been since rated by Mr. Knight’s directions, who told Mr. Surman, that he had taken that bill back again in payment (as the examinant believed) from Mt. Aislabie. That' a bill for the farther sum of 6,000l. was drawn the 11th of June 1720, and paid by the Bank, out of the cash kept there in the name of the South . Sea Company, to Mr. Aislabie, on the 10th of September last; and the sums of4, 700/. and 86/. were in the like manner drawn the 20th of September last, and paid to the said Mr. Aislabie on the first of October following.

Your Committee are still proceeding Open the matters referred to them, in-order to lay the same before the House.

The Commons take into Consideration that Part of the said Report which relates to Mr. Charles Stanhope.'] ' As the above Report related chiefly to great quantities of Stock and Subscriptions, which appeared to have been taken in for Mr. Aislabie, late Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Charles Stanhope, one of the Secretaries of the-Treasury, both of them thereupon insisted on:their innocence, and pressed, That a short day might be appointed to examine the matter, that they might have an opportunity to clear themselves.

_ Mr. jB rodrickrepresented thereupon, That

though the Secret Committee had a great deal of Evidence to support the charge against those two gentlemen, . yet they wanted a material witness, viz. Mr. Knight, late Treasurer of the South Sea Company, who was in safe custody, and, in all probability, would soon be brought over; and therefore the Committee hoped the House would not hurry an affair of so great importance.

Mr. Stanhope urging, how heavy an imputation, of so heinous a nature, lies upon a mss who knows himself to be entirely innocent, which, he said, was his case; and renewing his instances for examining into it; the 28th of February was appointed for that purpose.

Feb. 28. The Commons resumed the farther consideration of the Report from the Committee of Secrecy, some parts of which relating to Mr. Charles Stanhope -vdre read; after which, the Examination of sir John Blunt, Mr. Holditch, Mr. Jacob Sawbridge, sen. Mr. Henry Blunt, ' and others, before the' Committee of Secrecy, were severally read, and they were severally called in and examined, as were also Mr. Elias Turner, and others. The charge against Mr. Stanhope consisted of two articles. 1. That 10,000l. South Sea Stock was taken in for his benefit, by Mr. Knight, without any valuable consideration; and that the difference arising by the advanced price thereof was paid him out of the cash of the South Sea company. 2. That Turner and Company had bought 50,000l. stock at a low pried of the South Sea Company, in the name and for the benefit of Mr. Stanhope, the dif-

717] PAUL. HISTORY, 7 George 1.1721. — Stanhope > [745

fere nee of the advanced price whereof, amounting to 250,000l. bad beeu paid to the said Mr. Stanhope, by sir George C as wall and Company. To prove these Articles the Secret Committee caused the examinations before-mentioned, and the persons above-named, to be examined; but some of the latter rather weakened than corroborated their former depositions; sir John Blunt, in particular, owned, as to the first Article, that Mr. Knight had showed him a letter, which he told him was signed by Mr. Stanhope, desiring him to take 10,000l. stock for him; but that he did not know whether that letter was genuine, nor what was become of it; and as for the 50,000l. stock transferred to the Sword Blade Company in Mr. Stanhope’s name, Mr. Sawbridge and Mr. Turner had the modesty and good nature to take the whole charge upon themselves, and owned that they had made use of Mr. Stanhope’s name, without his privity or consent. '

These fexanunations, together with the animadversions of the members of the Secret Committee thereupon, lasted until eight in the evening, after which Mr. Stanhope Was heard in his place. As to the first Article, lie said, “ That for some years past he had lodged all the money he was master of in Mr. Knight’s hands, and whatever stock Mr. Knight had taken in “ for him, he had paid a valuable consideration for it: and as to the second, that he could not answer for what had been done without his consent.”

Mr. Stanhope cleared.] When he was withdrawn, a motion being made and the question being put, That it appears to this ; House, that during the time that the Proposal made by the South Sea Company, and the Bill relating thereto, were depending in this House, 10,000l. Stock was taken in, or held by Mr. Knight, late cashier of the said Company, for the benefit of Charles Stanhope, esq. a member of this House, without any valuable consideration paid, or security given for the acceptance of, or payment of the said Stock; and that the difference, arising by the advanced price thereof, was paid to the said Charles Stanhope, esq. out of th# cash of the South Sea Company, ” it was carried in the negative by a majority only of three voices, yiz. 180 against 177.* *

Juences it may have I cannot imagine; these think will be more or less by what, shall be done tomorrow, when Mr. Aislabie’s case comes on. Lord Stanhope (son to lord Chesterfield) carried off a pretty many, by mentioning in the strongest terms the memory of the late lord of that name: between forty and fifty who could not bring themselves to give negatives, were however persuaded to withdraw before the question. On the other hand, a great many of the affirmatives are gone out

Resolved* “ That the making use of the name of Charles Stanhope, esq. (a member of this House) in the Entries of the Books of Turner and Company, in order to conceal 50,000l. stock, supposed to be bought of the South Sea Company, was an unjustifiable and unwarrantable practice.”

The order of the day being read, for taking into further consideration the Reports from the Committee of Secrecy; those .parts of the first of the said Reports which related to John Aislabie, esq. a member of this House, were read; and then the Second Report from the'said Committee was read; and a Letter from the said Mr. Aislabie to Mr. Weymondsold, dated l*st March, 1719; and also, several Examinations of Mr. Weymond-sold before the said Committee; and the Examination of Mr. Robert Surman^ taken the 31st of January last; and the Examination of Mr. Francis Hawes before the said Committee, taken the 24th of February last, were read.

of town in the utmost rage, many of them not really displeased at what had happened, since it affords but too good a handle for fomenting greater discontent in the country. I own, I think it a very bad piece of policy, for the whole kingdom are enraged against the South Sea scheme, and not less so, against those who support their abettors. You will soon see, by reading the advertisements, the reason of sending the inclosed paper; Mr. Walpole lives opposite to B. Spars, the Swedish minister. The two brothers were remarkably the most zealous advocates, and perhaps may*prove so tomorrow, Quos Jupiter vult perdere de-

be thought)- will not be forgot, things may for a time be carried with a high haqd, but such violences cannot be long supported; a scalled head is soon broken. You will see by youc abstract of the report, that the proof was full as strong as the nature of the thing (Knight being gone) would admit of, and supported by many concurrent circumstances. Sir J. Blunt’s evidence was to be vilified, for further reasons* which you will easily guess at; every body sees through that.” Coxe’s Walpole. Correspondence:Mr. Brodrick to lord Middleton.

Afr. Aislabie expelled and committed to the

Tower.] But what was deposed against* him by Mr. Hawes, viz. That he had caused the Book of Accounts between them to be burnt, -and given him a discharge for the balance, amounting to about 842,000l. appeared so heinous, and so home a proof, that after he was withdrawn, the House came to the following Resolutions, viz.

4t Resolved, nem. con. i. That it appears to this House, that 22, $00/. South Sea stock was bought by Mr. Robert Knight, late cashier of the South Sea Company, upon the 3rd and 19th days of December, 1719, for the use and on the account of John Aislabie, esq. a member of this House, 'then chancellor and undertreasurer of the Exchequer, and one of the commissioners of his majesty’s Treasury.

“ 2. That from the 30th day of January, 1719, to the 4th day of March following inclusive, 70,000l. South Sea stock was transacted by Mr. Matthew Weymondsold, broker, by the direction and on the account of the’ said John Aislabie, esq.

“ 3. That 20,000l. South Sea stock, part of the said 70,000l. stock, was delivered to Mr. Matthew Weymondsold, broker, on the 12th of February, 1719, by Robert Sunn an, late deputy-cashier of the South Sea Company, at the rate of 130/. per cent, by direction of Robert Knight, late cashier of the said Company, for the use and benefit of the said John Aislabie, esq.

u 4. That several parcels of South Sea stock, part of the «aid 70,000l. stock, amounting to 20,000l. stock for 35, 357/. 10s. were bought by Matthew Weymondsold, broker, oil the 1st of March, 1719, by the order of the said John Aislabie, esq. and that the said 20,000l. stock was delivered by the said Matthew Weymondsold, on the 4th day of March, 1719, to Robert

Knight, late cashier of the South Sea Company, for the use and benefit of the said Mr. Aislabie; and that the said Robert Knight did then pay the said 35, 357/- 10s. for the same.

“ 5. That the aforesaid 20,000l. South Sep stock, was stock taken in and held by the said Robert Knight, for the benefit of the said John Aislabie, esq. after the proposals Of the South Sea Company were accepted by this House, and a bill ordered to be brought in thereupon, without any money paid or security given by; the said Mr. Aislabie for the said stock.

“ 6. That the taking in and holding the said 20,000l. South Sea stock, by the said Robert -Knight, with the privacy and for the benefit of the said John Aislabie, ety. was a most notorious, dangerous, and infamous corruption in the said Mr. Aislabie.

“ 7. That it appears to this House, that between the 20th of March 1720; and the 21st day of November following, there was an account between Turner and company and Edmund Waller son-in-law of the said John Aislabie, esq. amounting in the whole to the sum of794, 451/. 15s. 9 d.and that mere was also an account of Sooth Sea stock depending between the said Turner and company, and the said Mr. Waller, on the balanee of which last mentioned account there was 77, 600/. due from the. said Turner and company, ' for securing whereof the said Turlier and company, entered into bonds the 26th of November last, for 12 months from the 24th day of September then past, viz. One bond for 44, 600/. to the said Edmund Waller, and one other bond to Thomas Weddal, esq., for 33,000l. in* trust for the said John Aislabie.

“8. That the said John Aislabie, esq. was privy to, and did approve and consent, that the million of Exchequer Bills, lent by the Treasury to the South Sea Company, should be lent out by the said Com'pany upon their stock, and accordingly the same was done.

“ 9. That the said John Aislabie, esq. at a ipeeting with the said sub-governor and several of the directors of the South Sea Company, did advise the taking in the first money subscription at 300/. per cent, and agreed to promote the same.

“ 10. That the said John Aislabie, esq. gave in a list to the late Directors of the Sooth Sea company, of the names of persons to be admitted into the third money-subscription, at 1,000l. per cent, for several sums of money amounting to 75, 300/. and did thereby promote and encourage the said subscription.

“ 11. That the said John Aislabie, esq. has \ encouraged and promoted the dangerous and I destructive execution of the late South Sea 1 scheme, with a view to his own exorbitant J profit, and has combined with the late Directors of the South Sea Company in their pernicious practices, to the detriment of great numbers of his majesty’s subjects, and the ruin of the public credit and the tn\de of this kingdom.

South Sea stock taken in, and held by, Robert Knight, for the use of Elias Turner, Jacob Sa'wbridge, and sir George Caswall, a member of this House, was read:and a Transfer in the South-Sea Company’s transfer-book, dated the 18th of February 1719.

* “ March 9. Yesterday night past twelve, Mr. Aislabie’s fate was determined, as you will see by the votes, . almost the whole time being taken up in examining numbers of witnesses (late directors) called by him. The questions proposed was the same to them all, viz. Whether they knew or had beard of any fictitious stock taken in, or held for him, or of any stock bought for his use with the Company’s money, to every of which they all answered roundly in the negative, from whence he argued the certainty, and as he expressed himself even to a demonstration of his innocence, for that it was not to be conceived, but they ihust have known the thing. As to the proceedings of the .Directors (to whom he gave all the hard names be could think of) his plea was ignorance. To the charge of having great dealings in stock (pending the bill) he said nothing, otherwise .than by insinuation, thatdoing so with his own money, he hoped would not be criminal. His concerting with the directors, taking in the 1st subscription at 300 per cent, he dropt, not saying one word to the charge; but an inoident happened which gave great disgust to the House. The second Report takes notice of great dealings in stock between him and Mr. Hawes, (formerly his clerk, as Treasurer of the Navy) who had informed the Committee, that those accounts were finally adjusted in November last, when Mr. Aislabie insisted upon having Mr. Hawes's book (of which he had a duplicate) delivered him, that no one might see it, which was done accordingly upon his giving IlaweB a general release. On Tuesday, a motion was made for his laying that book before the House as yesterday, which he opposed,

Then Mr. Mount was called iii and produced the Night Cash-book of Turner and Co. and for the lOtband 12th of Dec. 1720, which was read, and he was examined. Then the examination of Mr. Jacob Sawbridge, sen. taken before tbd Committee of Secrecy the 20th of January last; and also Mr. Knight’s examination taken before the said Committee the 21st of January last, were read. And then Mr. Surman was again called in and examined. And then Mr. Elias Turner, and Mr. John Mount were severally called in and examined; and the Cash-Book o(Turner and Co. of the 18thof February last, 1719, was read. After this,

Sir George Caswall was heard in his place, and, in his Defence alledged, Thathehad made a lawful bargain for the stock in question with Mr. Knight, and |>ad several times offered to pay the value of it, but was put off, from time to time by Mr. Knight, who. told him, he was not at leisure to make up accounts with him; and that Mr. Knight had sufficient security in his hands. To prove which sir George called several witnesses. Hereupon three or four members spoke in his behalf, and among other things said they were satisfied be had given safficient security: but the question being put whether he had or not, it was carried in the negative by 227 voices against 92. Then

as. what the House could not demand, for that it related only to his own private account with Hawes, but was overruled by the House, and ordered to.bring in the book; wherewith not complying, notice was taken of it in the House. He then desired Mr. Hawes- might be examined, who said at the bar, that when he delivered up the book, both that and the duplicate (in Mr. Aislabie’s hand) were burnt, of which Mr. Hawes made no mention when examined by the Committee, nor did Mr. Aislabie oh Tuesday; from whence it was concluded that this was an after thought, and the books burnt (if at all) ex post facto. He had on Tuesday imprudently enough said, that if the Committee should have depnauded those books, he would have burnt them before their faces.

“ After his defence, the questions went without other opposition, than what was very slender, by Mr. Minshal and Mr, Fuller; sir Richard Steele said a little, not very plain in effect (as I understood him) that the examinations did not sufficiently support the question proposed, but it did not obtain. Mr. Walpole’s corner sat mute as fishes. Mr. Fuller, upon one question demanded a division, which was very artfully turned off by the Speaker, and generally understood with design to obviate the difficulty those in employment might lie under, . on whatever side they should divide. Thus the matter ended, and in return for the fatigue the House underwent, we got a play day, adjourning till to morrow, when I think sir George Caswell will have the same fate.” Cnxe’s Walpole.

Sir Qttorgc Caszoall stood up again, and expressed his great sorrow, that he bad the misfortune to fall under the displeasure of the House; which lay the more heavy upon him, because be was -not conscious of any crime, unless it were the extraordinary zeal and affection be had shewn for the support of the present happy settlement, having assisted the government with vast sums of money, at three per cent, when they could get it no where else: for the truth of which he appealed to the members of the House, who were then commissioners of the treasury. Hereupon Mr. Clayton stood up, and witnessed to the truth of his allegation:

the House came to the following Resolutions, viz.

1. That it appears to this House, That, during the time the Bill for enabling the South* Sea Company to enlarge their Capital stock and fund, was depending in' parliament, 5O,000^.-stock, being part of the 574, 50 fictitious stock, entered in the cash-book of the Company; as sold for 1, 259, 325/. was taken in or sold by Robert Knight, late cashier of the said Company, for IJlias Turner, Jacob Sawbridge, and sir George Caswall, (a member of this House) without any valuable consideration paid, or sufficient security given for the accept^ ance of, or payment for, such stock.

Sir George Caswall expelled and committed to the Tower.*] But his past services not being thought a sufficient atonement for the great share he had in the fraudulent management of the South-Sea Scheme, after he was withdrawn,

* “ March 11. Yesterday sir George Caswell had Mr. Aislabie’s fate, with this further addition, of refunding 250,000l. as you will see by the votes. The day was long enough, though not so bad as the other; for we rose just after eight o’clock. Our time was taken up by an insignificant defence, endeavouring to prove that company losers by the South-Sea. The only material thing insisted upon by him, was a pretence of having given sufficient security for the 50,000l. stock, taken in by Knight for them, in order to get clean of a former resolution.

• “ The case (as himself opened it,) stood thus: in January or February 1719, (for we can never fix them to certain times in any instance) he and company pawned 70,000l. stock to the South-Sea Company, borrowing 105,000l. upon it. The first of March following, Knight takes in the 50,000l. fictitious stock for them; upon which, two questions arose. First, whether the pawned stock could (without agreement of parties) remain a farther security for the 50,000l. stock taken in by Knight, even suppose it would in value have answered both; - secondly, whether it would have been sufficient security. The master of (he rolls differed from his brethren upon the first; insisting that before they should have been let into the redemption upon payment of the 105,000l. they would have been obliged in equity to have paid for the 50,000l. Stock taken in by Knight. I must here observe, that long after, and at the bar said to* be the 13th of May, (though no witness upon oath before the Committee would fix the-time) a note under Caswell's hand was sent to Mr. Knight for 125,000l. the price of the 60,000l. stock* at 250/. per cent. As to the second point, it was urged (and generally agreed to) that if the South-Sea scheme had failed in our House, the 70,000l. stock would not have been near a sufficient security for the 105,000l. -lent thereon. The master’s differing from us, was, in my opinion, what led the managersinto tbs demand of a division upon the first question;

Vot. VH.

but they soon saw their error, the yeas being 228, the noes but 92. You will easily believe, the subsequent questions were given up upon seconding; if I mistake not, the first question was battailed to avoid the consequence of our last question, that of refunding. For it is gene- rally thought, this stock was in trust for others, and this was in plain terms spoke strongly to in the debate. Even the master of the rolls declared freely his being of that opinion; going yet farther, that he did not see how any member could justify buying stock (pending the bill) although he should even have paid ready money for it. It is not to be conceived what satisfaction these two days work have given, and indeed it is well it so happens, for the rage was grown to such height upon the acquittal of Stanhope, that no man can tell when it would have ended. Bonfires were made in the city the day Mr.^Aislabie went to theTower.

“ It is said, an attack upon the Committed was talked of in private, and intended, but we have acted with such caution and candour as to bid defiance. Should any thing of that kind be attempted, they must have a better posse than appears at present. Our credit throughout the kingdom will sufficiently support us. Let them look to themselves, they stand on a sandy foundation. In debating the motion for a bill against Mr. Aislabie, Mr. Walpole said, impeaching (not billing ministers) was the way of parliamentary proceeding in time of our ancestors*; which was very smartly animadverted upon, particularly by the master. He observed (saying that gentleman very well knew) that the course of parliamentary proceedings was altered, quite inverted, by rendering all prosecutions, by way of impeachments ineffectual; 4 that no greater instance need be given than in the present case, wherein the Lords had by way of art* ticipation entered into the examination of whdt properly belonged to the Commons, in order to come to a resolution of the legality of that constitution, made by the treasury ', appointing the directors judges, where they were beyond possibility of denial, parties; by which means all the public creditors were imposed upon and defrauded, and which in truth, was the first and chief source of the misfortunes which have happened.” Coxe’s Walpole.

sary, for the further information of the House, that the several witnesses who had been *•* amined by the committee, might be examined at the bar, since possibly they might not cornu up, in every particular whereof they had in* formed the committee, or might so far explain their meaning, as to give a very different turn from what the words of their examination might possibly import. We very well foresaw gaining a night was chiefly in view, and it had, in my opinion, its effect, for when they came to he examined, upon cross questions, every one of them strengthened the report; among tbn rest ordered to attend, sir John Blunt was one, but his lordship's advocates did not think fit to call him in. The abstract of the report which you have, will evince the strength of the case, which I own I think fuller proved, and so t said, than any of the three cases which had been under consideration.

The defence made, was entirely different from what I expected, there being, as I appro* hended, no room left for, denying the fact, wherefore I concluded the sufficiency of the so* curity, his lordship's note, sworn to have bee shewed sir J. Blunt, by Knight, would have been insisted upon, but that point was given up, and his lordship's denial of any stock taken, or net* given., was the subject of three hours debate, after all the papers read, and witnesses examined; by way of negative proof, Mr, Pel* ham, brother to the duke of Newcastle, and Mr. Walpole, informed the House, that hid lordship had empowered them to declare, that no stock had ever been taken in for him by Knight, or note given, so that the question m truth, was neither more or less than whether we should give credit to that assertion, or sir Joha Blunt’s oath. A good deal of pains was taken to falsify the oath, by asking the witnesses at the bar, whether Knight had told them of thin stock being taken in presence and hearing o sir John Blunt, as he had Sworn, they owned Knight's telling them of the stock so taken in for lord Sunderland. One of them said he was alone with Knight when he told him of it; two others owned sir John’s being in the room when> he told it them, but did not believe bitn within hearing of what Knight said. Such trifling stuff never surely was insisted upon in any other case, end would in any other have been the strongest proof of the fact. It wa9 foreseen too well, that such a defence was not to be robed upon, and therefore the sheet anchor was lord Oxford’s play.

March 20. Mr. Methuen acquainted the House, that their Address, relating to Mr. Knight, having been presented to the king, his majesty bad commanded him to lay before the House, several Letters and Papers, containing advices from Flanders concerning him, and at the same time, to acquaint the House, that his . majesty had not received any advice from thence relating to Mr. Knight; that as soon as any -should come to his majesty, they should be laid before the House: hereupon several Letters from Mr. Leathes, his majesty's resident at Brussels, to the Secretary of State, were 'read, importing m substance. “ That pursuant to his orders, he had made the most pressing instances with the marquess de Prie, for the delivering up of Mr. Knight: but had been answered, that the said marquess had not received any instructions from Vienna about that matter;

but tell truly and in short the whole case. I

- take it for granted we are over the material parts of both reports, if what I heard this day in the House prove true..

that, in the mean time, he was apprehensive ' that the same would meet with great difficulties. That the Greffier, or Secretary, of the States of Brabant, had been twice with the said marquess, to represent to him, that according to one of the articles of the Joyful Entry of Brabant, which was granted them by the emperor Charles 5, and has been sworn to by all his successors, and which they look upon as their Magna Charta, no person charged with, or apprehended for any crime, can be removed to be tried out of their province; and that the Deputies of the States insisted upon that article, of which the resident had enclosed a copy in French, which was also read in the House.”

Most of the members appeared surprized at the unexpected difficulties about the delivering up of Mr. Knight, which was started in the name of the States of Brabant; dnd lord Molesworth said thereupon: That it was to be hoped, they should have a more satisfactory answer from Vienna, thao they had from Brussels:but if they had not, it would, in his opinion, be proper to call for the Treaties lately entered into with the House of Austria, to know upon wfiat motives we have been at so great an expence of blood and treasure, and have sent our men of war to rot and be worm-eaten in the Mediterranean, to conquer kingdoms for the emperor ? Adding, That if that pretended Privilege of the States of Brabant, should be insisted upon, they might remove that obstacle, by addressing his majesty to grant his pardon to Mr. Knight, in order to have him brought over: but that it was proper not to make any farther step in that affair, till they were acquainted with the success of colonel Churchill’s Negotiation at Vienna.

. March 22. Mr. Methuen 'acquainted the House, That his majesty having, the day before, received a Letter from colonel Churchill^ directed to the lord viscount Townshend, dated Vienna, the 4th of March, 1720-21, had commanded him, pursuant to the Address of the House, to lay a copy thereof before the Hou*e, which he presented to the House accordingly. The Copy of that Letter was thereupon read, importing in substance, Thdt he was just arrived at Vienna, and would not lose one moment, in making the most pressing instances to the imperial court, for the delivering up Mr. Knight; and that he did not doubt success, unless the Privileges of the States of Brabant interfered:severaksmart reflections were made by lord Molesworth, 'upon the frivolous pretence that was made use of, to bafflle his majesty's endeavours to bring over Mr. Knight: but'the House did not think fit to come to any resolution thereupon. The same evening colonel Churchill arrived from Vienna, which occasioned an universal surprize.

March 24. Colonel Churchill being come into the House, it was expected that an account of his Negotiations would, this day, have been' laid, before the Commons; but they were only given to understand; that as soon as the dis-

fS9J PAUL. HISTORY, 7 Geo»oi I. wn. — Petkimifor Jtatke m the (MS

•patches be brought from Vienna could be translated, they should be laid before the House, vrbo thereupon adjourned till the 27th.

Farther Debate on M. not being delivered tip.] March 27. Mr. Methuen acquainted the House, that his Majesty had commanded him to lay before them* copies of several Letters and Papers relating to Mr. Knight, which he presented to the House accordingly, with a Schedule of them. The copies of the said Letters were read, and among them a Letter from the Emperor to the king of Great Britain, expressing his imperial majesty’s inclination and readiness to comply with his Britannic majesty’s desires, as to the delivering up Mr. Knight; but that the States of Brabant having and claiming particular Privileges, which his imperial majesty was engaged to maintain, it would be necessary to make application to the Said States; and his imperial majesty, on his .part, would not fail to support such instances as should be made. Tor which effect prince Eugene wrote a Letter to the Marquis de Prie, which was also read. Several smart reflections ' were made, by lord Molesworth, on the former of those two> Letters:but this affair being equally nice and important, it was resolved to \take into consideration the several Letters and Papers relating to Mr. Knight, which his majesty had communicated to the House, in a grand - committee on the 29th.

(March 29. The Commons, in a grand committee took into consideration the said Letters . and Papers. After the reading of some of those Papers,

Mr. Hutcheson opened the debate, representing, * How much, on the one hand, the public " was concerned, in having the authors of the 'present distress fully discovered and brought to condign punishment; and how impracticable it was, on the other hand, to proceed in this important inquiry, so long as the principal agent •f the late South-Sea Directors, and their ac- complices, was kept out of the way; that in the mean time, the public calamity encreasing every day, the nation called aloud for justice:and therefore, if the means already used for bringing over Mr. Knight, proved abortive, it ' were advisable to have recourse to more ' speedy and effectual methods.

6ir Joseph Jekyll, and the lord Molesworth, strongly supported Mr. Hutcheson, and in particular shewed, That it was incumbent on some persons in the administration to have Mr. Knight brought over, in order fully to clear ' their own innocence; otherwise, though acquitted, they would still be looked upon as criminal.* Urging, That it was matter of wonder that so frivolous a pretence, as the privileges of the states of Brabant, should be made use of to put a stop to so important an inquiry, espe-, dally considering how little those privileges had been regarded in more material points; and what obligations the House of Austria lay under ' to the British nation.

Sir Richard Steele offered something against

obliging Mr. Knight to be an .evidence, whether he would or no:but no great stress was laid upon it. On the other hand,

Mr. Leckmerc represented, That in all probability the court of Vienna had not, at first, * fully considered the importance of the instances that were made to them in his majesty’s name, and at the desire of the Commons of Great Britain t but that it was to be presumed that when so wise a prince as the present emperor, should be apprized, that the welfare and safety of England, to whom his imperial majesty has so great obligations, depended, in some measure, on the delivering up of Mr. Knigiit, he would readily comply with their desires.

Another Address to the King .] Here-

upon, Mr. Lechmere moved, “ That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, returning the Thanks of this House for the instance* he has been pleased to make, by a Letter under his royal hand to his imperial majesty, for obtaining the delivering up of Mr. Knight, pursuant to the Address of this House; and for communicating to this House, the steps which have been taken relating thereto: and to represent to his majesty, tire dissatisfaction which his Commons have at the obstacles which they find have been raised, under the pretence of the Privileges of the'States of Brabant, agaioSt a compliance with his gracious endeavours, and also to represent, that this House is evety day more and more convinced of the high importance it is to the justice due to his majesty’s people, that effectual measures be speedily taken for bringing over Mr. Knight: ana (earnestly to beseech his majesty, to employ his most pressing endeavours, in such manner, as in his great wisdom shall be thought proper, for attaining the just desire of his Commons.”

Nobody offered to oppose this motion, which, after Mr. Speaker had resumed the chair, Mr. Broderick'reported to the House; and the same being agreed to, nan: con. it was resolved, That the said Resolution be laid before his majesty by the whole House.

The King's Answer.']March SO. The Commons, to the number of above 300, with their Speaker, went to St. James’s, and presented the said Resolution to the king; to which his majesty returned the following Answer; (

u Gentlemen;

uI am very well pleased, that the instances which I have made for obtaining the delivering up of Mr. Knight, have given you satisfaction; I shall coutinue to employ my utmost endeavours for obtaining what you desire, ~and hope they will prove effectual.”

Several Remarkable Petitions for Justice on the Authors of the present Calamities.] About this time many Petitions were presented to the House of Commons, praying for Justice on the Authors of the present Calamities:of which, the following are the most remarkable; .:. *

#6lJ PARL. HISTORY, 7 George I. 1721.-*Authors of the Present Calamities. [7

To the Hon. the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament assembled i The humble Petition of tbo Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled. *

« Sheweth, That your petitioners think it their duty most humbly to represent to this 'honourable House the present state of the City of London, so considerable a part of the kingdom, now filled with numberless objects of grief and compassion, the sad effects of the mismanagement, avarice, and fatal contrivances of the late directors of the South-Sea Company, their aiders, abettors and confederates, in the des-trnction of their country.

“ Nor is it the case of this great city alone your petitioners lament, but the general decay of trade, manufactures, and oLpubliccredit, whereof this honourable House have been always so extremely tender; as also of the ho- nour' of the British name and nation.

“ Your petitioners beg leave to return their most humble thanks to this honourable House, for the great pains they have taken to relieve flie unhappy sufferers, by compelling the offenders to make restitution; as likewise for their continued application to lay open this whole scene of guilt, notwithstanding the iudus-trious artifices of such sharers in the common plunder, as have endeavoured to obstruct the detection of fraud and corruption. And your petitioners doubt not, but the same fortitude, impartiality and public spirit, wherewith this honourable House have hitherto acted, will still animate them in the pursuit of those truly great and noble ends.

“We are too sensible of the load of the public debts, not to wish that all proper methods may be taken to lessen them: 4n<* it is an infinite concern to us, that the payment of a great sum towards them (which was expected from the late scheme) is now rendered extremely difficult, if not impracticable; and yet is a cloud hanging over the heads of the present unfortunate proprietors of the South-Sjea Company, and a great damp to public credit. We will not presume to mention in what manner ' relief may be given in this arduous affair, but . most humbly submit it to the consideration of this honourable House.

“ Your petit ioners therefore most humbly pray this honourable House will be pleased to take such farther measures as they, in their great wisdom, shall judge proper, that trade may .flourish, public credit be restored, and justice done to .an injured people. And your petitioners shall pray, &c.”

' The bumble Petition of the justice* of peace, grand' jury, gentlemen and freeholders, assembled at the quarter-sessions of the peace, holden the 17th of April 1721, for the county of Hertford:

“ Sheweth, That your petitioners being truly sensible of their happiness, under the best of ''Constitutions, beg leave (among other of their

fellow-subjects) to lay before this honourable House the great miseries they labour under hf the decay of trade, manufactures, and public credit.

“ We are amazed to think to what an extra* vagant height the late directors of the South Sea Company, their aiders and confederates, had fatally wrought up the credit of their stock by their -wicked arts and delusions, to the in* jury of the public, as if purposely designer} to destroy their country, and, under a pretended zeal to his majesty and his family, to lay such a foundation of prejudice, by the poverty of the people, as should even stagger those whose loyalty has been ever most conspicuous.

“ Your petitioners having a just sense of the earnest endeavours of this honourable House to relieve the unhappy sufferers thereby, are persuaded that the subtle contrivance of those who so justly dreadt the discovery of their guilt, will at length be defeated by the courage and resolution of this honourable House; and that the secret springs of such who concurred with the directorajn those designs, will be made appear, and laid before the whole world, to their utter confusion.

“ Your petitioners are persuaded, from the firmness and vigour of this honourable House, that no difficulties will obstruct the glorious steps they are pursuing, to bring to punishment the authors of ail this misery, let the offenders be ever so distinguished, by the greatness of their stations; and as their crimes are of the blackest dye, (even a determined resolution to destroy this once most flourishing kingdom) so we hope, from the justice of this honourable House, such examples willl»e made, as shall free us from the terror of such apprehensions for the future.

“ We are too truly affected with the great debt the nation labours under, not heartily to wish all proper methods were found out to lessen the same: But as the late scheme of the South Sea Company (upon which our hopes were built for an immediate relief of a considerable sum) has proved abortive, by the avarice of the late managers thereof, so we fear the consequence of insisting upon that contract with the. South Sea Company, towards the discharging of the public debts, would be the lost of the little credit that remains.

“ Your Petitioners, in full confidence of the wisdom of this honourable House, most humbly pray, that no artifices whatsoever may be able to divert you from those just measures which you are taking to restore Public Credit, make trade flourish, and do justice to a most injured nation. And your Petitioners shall ever pray, &c.”

The humble Petition of the justices of peace, grandeury, clergy, gentlemen, and fres-hold-ers of the county, of Kent, at the genera} quarter-sessions of the Peace, holden at Maidstone, in, and for the said county of Kent; the 18th day of April, 1721.

“ Sheweth; — That the county of Kent, late* ly one of the richest and most flourishing in the

Dy ,

kingdom, is at present, by the execrable fraud •f the late wricked South-sea Directors, and their more wicked accomplices, reduced to a most unhappy condition, which your Petitioners beg leave to represent to this honourable House, which hath always been ready to hear the voice of an injured people, and fully avenge them of their enemies.

“ It is with the utmost indignation, that we tee this honourable House struggling with unexpected opposition; and labouring under unaccountable difficulties; and we can never sufficiently express our resentment, when we behold the king of Great Britain, in vain demanding the person of a man, inconsiderable for every thing, except his crimes; who, as he was-no doubt prevailed on to fly his country, to obstruct justice upon greater offenders, is still denied on pretences too weak to give satisfaction to so wise a prince, and so discerning a people.

“We should be very much wanting in gratitude to this honourable House, if we had not the deepest sense of the endeavours they have used to relieve ns under our present distress:happy! if those endeavours had not been> iu some measure, obstructed by the contrivance of those miscreants, who, as they have art enough to cover their iniquity, flatter themselves, that they have power sufficient to be screened from justice. But we doubt not, this honourable House, the constant guardian of our rights, will think it Decoming their great wisdom to shew those conspirators their mistake, who vainly imagine, tlrat by thus plundering their fellow-subjects, they bave so far weakened them, as to render their Very resentments impotent and ineffectual.

“ The city of London have so fully expressed our sense of the load of Public Debts, and of the manner of being eased therefrom, that to •ay more, would be a vain and useless repetition. And therefore, for our speedy and effectual relief (entirely depending on your wise and just deliberations,) Your; bumble Petitioners shall ever pray.* '

The humble Petition-of the mayor, bailiffs and

burgesses of the borough of Leicester,

“ ShewethThat though by indulgent providence, your Petitioners are clear of South-Sea projects, and neither tainted with the guilt of contriving, nor hurt by giving credit to the late cursed impostures; yet we are sharers in the national calamity, which involves all, the wicked authors only excepted; whose successful crimes have raised tuem above the reach of ordinary justice, and left them nothing to fear dr ns to hope, but from the legislative power. With utmost resignation therefore to the justice and wisdom of this honourable House, our most deplorable state and condition is represented.

“No sooner had the South-Sea Directors, and the vile emissaries they detached over the kingdom, to propagate lies and forgeries, so imposed upon the honest credulous people, as to draw •U their ready money aad treaaue into their in-

famous hands*but we saw trade instantly struck dead, our manufactures disregarded, our combed-wool (once the staple and glory of qub industrious corporation) he neglected in our workhouses, our poor increasing for want of employment; many who cheerfully paid taxes towards-supporting out happy government, reduced by want of trade to a miserable exemption fronx them.

“ And, as if these did not amount to ft sufficient measure of evils, we are alarmed with yet more to come, and threatened that the sole relief to an almost despairing people, the singla recompence for all their sufferings, shall be attempted to be wrested from them, viz. the seven millions due by contract from the South-sea company towards payment of the Public; Debts, and relaxing part of those taxes which the people have long borne, and now weakened and impoverished by South-Sea scheme?, are unable to sustain, shall be sacrificed to that Company, to raise high again their fatal credit* revive stock-jobbing, and pour out the last drop* of the nation's blood to' be licked up by this cannibals of Change Alley.

“ Such a project (were it possible it could Succeed) for confirming perpetual debts, mortgages and taxes, upon a people deploring already their hard fate under undeserved miseries* would give (we humbly apprehend) an incurable wound to trade and national credit, heighten their griefs into despair, shock their steady affections to this good government, and Unimate its enemies to farther attempts.

“ But under the protection of so just and wise a parliament, the scourge of wicked avarice* we have nothing to fear from such wild and destructive schemes, and nothing to petition for, but that this honourable House will proceed with the spirit and justice they have begun, to disappoint every mischievous enterprize and avaricious design, and bring to condign punishment all who should be found conspiring to enrich themselves by the uudoing of their country.

“ So shall public faith and credit be re-established on their foundations, justice, and strict^ observance of Contracts; honest trade, released from heavy impositions, which have so long depressed it, raise its head, and contend with success against its knavish rival stock-jobbing; poverty, and with it, discontent vanish; our gracious sovereign king George reign over an once more prosperous and happy people, as able as willing, by large supplies, to promote both his majesty's glory and safety. And your Petitioners shall pray, &c."

<(That divine Providence hath removed some #f the actors in this black tragedy, and sharers of the spoils of their fellow subjects, beyond the reach of human power, but their estates are left behind. And your petitioners do with great sa.^faction confide in the justice and wisdom of this honourable House to complete the great work, they have with so much honour, courage, and impartiality begun and pursued, in order to compel notorious criminals to make a restitution for the relief of the present unhappy proprietors of the South Sea Company, as ample and extensive as the many instances of discovery, and the qualities of the persons concerned will permit.

“ Your Petitioners therefore do, with the greatest deference and submission, pray the consideration of this honourable House, with tespect to that part of the South Sea scheme, which relates to the public debts of the nation, and other the premises, in order to revive our languishing trade, to restore public credit, to remove the discontent, and, as far as is practicable, silence the complaints of an injured nation, by such ways and methods, as they, in their great wisdom, shall see meet.

u In obedience to your order of the 27th of March last, whereby the said several duplicates of the inventories and particulars were referred to the consideration of a. Committee,

“ Your Committee, for that purpose appointed, in pursuance of the said order, have employed some part of theirtime in the inspecting and considering several of the said inventories and particulars: And, finding all or most of them to contain different methods in the computations of the said estates; and setting forth' generally the particulars of their several estates as they were upon the first day of June last: and then carrying on a diary, or journal account; of their several transactions, from that day tq the time they delivered in their .inventories to the barons of the exchequer, pursuant to the act of parliament in that behalf.

“ Your Committee found it impossible, or at least exceedingly difficult, to represent to the House the just balances of their respective aoi counts, over and besides the debts, and other engagements, wherewith their estates are sai4 to be charged and affected:

“ Thereupon your Committee, the better to

781] PARL. HIST. 7 George I. 1721.-

clear up thisdiffisulty in the most expeditious and certain" way, and to put this matter in the fullest light that could be, for the information of the House, made several-orders, whereby the said sub-governor, deputy governor, directors, deputy cashier, and accountant, were ordered to lay before your Committee an account of the present estimate, or value, in mo-4>ey, of their several real and personal estates, contained in the said inventories or particulars, in the most summary manner; and that, in such estimate, or valuation, they should estimate, or value their Bank stock, South Sea-stock, and East India stock, at 150 per cent, one with another; their Bank and Lottery Annuities, lottery tickets, exchequer orders, East India and South Sea bonds, at par; their Long Annuities at 510 years purchase; their Short Annuities at 14 years, purchase; and their other stocks and securities as they were currently sold for, or valued at, upon the 525th day of March last:

“ That, in pursuance of the aforesaid Orders, the said sub-governor, deputy-governor, directors, and deputy-cashier, attended your committee, and left with them abstracts, in writing, of the estimated Values in money, of their several real and personal Estates, comprised and mentioned in their said respective inventories and particulars; and have balanced the same in such manner as that the said several balances may be taken as clear money, over and besides what they severally owe, ot are indebted; except some contracts for lands, and other things, which are under contest; and over and besides such settlements and provisions as they allege to have been made for their respective families: and Mr. Grigsby, not being able to attend the committee, sent his abstract, and balance, in the same 'form as the other: all which balances, amounting, together, to the sum of 2, 014, 123/. 16s. 7 your committee have inserted in a schedule, and annexed the same to this their report, shewing what each person’s particular balance amounts to.

“ Youccommittee craves leave to inform the House, that sir John Lambert having attended them, on the third day of April, with the abstract of his estate, and thereby stated his balance to be 72, 508/. Is. 5d. he afterwards, on the 6th of April, attended again, and alleged, That he was mistaken in his said abstract; and desired your committed to deceive a supplemental paper, by which he would have reduced his balance, so delivered in as before, 22, 610/. 8s. 4 d.; and thereby the said balance of 72, 508/. Is. 5d. would have been not more than 49, 897/. 13s/Id.: but, your committee, foreseeing the inconveniencies that might probably arise to them from others, by their receiving such paper, thought fit to reject the same, and to take only a minute thereof, to enable them to represent the Act to the House.

M/As to the other part of your order, whereby your committee are directed-to make their observations upon the said inventories and particulars; your committee crave leave to in-

Your Committee, in a former Report, acquainted the House, That the indisposition of Edmund Waller, esq. had prevented their laying before the House, iu that report, a more particular account relating to the sum of 794, 451/. 15s. 9 d.received and paid, by Turner and Company, upon the account of the said Mr. Waller, between the 28th of March 1719, and the 21st of November following: And, having since, viz. on the 22d of March 1720, examined Mr. Waller, he saith.

Your Committee afterwards received a letter from the said Mr. Waller, dated the 19th "of April instant; wherein be desired to be again examined, to clear up any mistakes, if , there were any, in his former examination, and to give the Committee the best information he could: Whereupon your Committee did take his further examination; winch is as follows;

He says, That, in February or March 1719, when he began to deal in stock, lie had of the money of his mother, his brother, his own, and his wife’s fortune, about the suin of 20,000l. of which his wife’s fortune was 5,000l. which he had in bank notes; that he employed the said 20,000l. in buying stock. That he cannot tell how much of this 20,000l. was his own money. That he never kept any account in writing of that part of the said 20,000l. which belonged to his mother and brother, but that he has told them, whut belonged to them.

And your Committee inform the House, that the said Mr. Waller, upon his said farther examination, did declare, that there was not in the said book any article relating to Mr. Aislabie; but this appearing to be in direct contradiction to what he had said in his first examination, your Committee did not insert the same in this subsequent examination, sigped by the said Mr. Waller, but think it proper to represent this matter to House the.

Your Committee having, in a former report, taken notice, that James Craggs, sen. esq. had 30,000l. South-Sea stock taken in for him, or his friends, they sent for an account of transfers made to the said Mr. Craggs, which was accordingly laid before them, a copy of winch account is hereunto annexed in the Appendix, No. 1, by which your Committee find, that (among other great sums) there was on the 28th of March 1720, a sum of 30,000l. stock transferred by Mr. Jacob Sawbridge (one oF the partners of Turner and Company) to the said Mr: James Craggt.

And your Committee proceeded to examine the following persons concerning the tranfsrs.

Mr. Jacob Sawbridge (late one of the directors of the South-Sea Company, end a partner

* &5) PARL. HISTORY, 7 George I.

with Tamer and Company) says, that in the beginning of February 1719, by order of Mrf Robert Khight, late cashier of the South-Sea Company, or Mr. Robert Surman his deputy, Turner and Company took in 30, 900/. South-Sea stock, and gave Mr. Knight, or Mr. Surman, a note for the same, at which time Mr. Knight paid into Turner and company 67, 020/. Is. 8 upon the general cash account between the said Turner and company, and Knight or Surman as cashier of the South-Sea Company; and that on the 28th of March following, the examinant, by order of the said Knight or Sdrman, transferred the said stock to James .CYaggs, sen. esq. deceased, without receiving any money, or consideration from him for the same, and at the same time took up his said note, and believes it was upon the file, as other notes usually are. That he did, by the direction of this Committee the night before this examination, (which was on the 19th of April instant) search upon the file, and not finding it there, be went to sir George Caswall to enquire after the said note, and acquainted him that in searching for the note on the file, he could hot find it there; whereupon sir George told the examinant, that he himself had the note not long ago, and believed it was in his scrutoire, and accordingly sent his lady to search for it; who returned while this examinant was there, and (as the examinant believes) brought several papers; upon which sir George Caswall told the examinant, he would look for the note, and send it to him the next morning, before be attended the Committee, if he could find it.; but the examinant said, he had not then received it, nor had heard from sir G. Caswall.

- Hereupon your Committee sent for sir George Caswall, who being examined says, that about six weeks since, James Craggs, sen. esq; the post-master, desired the examinant to look upon the files of Turner and company, for a note for the delivery of 30,000l. South-Sea 6tock, which had been signed by Jacob' Sawbridge, "(another of the partners ofTurner and company, on account of himself and company) in\ these words, or to this effect:

* I promise to deliver to Robert Knight, or

* his order, or bearer, 30,000l. South-Sea stock

* for value received and, (as he believes) was dated the 6th day of February, 1719, which note Was Cancelled, the stock therein mentioned, having been transferred to the said Mr. Craggs, according to the import of the said note. That tiie examinant did desire the servants ofTurner and company to look out this note, which (hey accordingly did, and found it cancelled, and on the file, and gave it to the examinant, who delivered it to Mr. Craggs, supposing he would only have read and returned it; but be kept it; faying, it might be of some use to him upon an occasion, upon which the examinant left it with him. That Mr. Craggs, nor any body by his -order, never returned this note, to the examinant, nor has the examinant seen it, till the morning on which he was examined; that as be mas coming, the nporning be was examined; to

1721. — of the South Sea Company. [?S6

attend the Committee, to be examined, about Somerset-house, brigadier Richards called out to thp coach, which stopped, and he came to the coach side, and Mr. Huggins with him, and Mr. Huggins then shewed the examinant the said note, with other papers annexed to it; .but what those'papers were, the examinant does not know; wheieupon .Mr. Huggins said, that he did not know but the examinant might be asked something about that note, and there it was; that the examinant very well remembers it to be the same note which he had before delivered to Mr. Craggs as aforesaid, it being signed by Mr. Sawbridge, and the body of the note of the hand-writing of Mr. Knight; and Mr. Huggins then took the note out of the examinant’s hand, 1 and gave it to brigadier Richards, and told the examinant that he might tell the Committee that the brigadier had it, and would produce it; that two or three day? ago Mr. Sawbridge inquired of him where this note was, and he not then recollecting whether it was in his custody or no, did give directions to his wife to search for it in his 6crutoire, and found that he had it not, and. says, that he knows nothing of his own knowledge of the transaction of this 30,000l. stock.

The said Mr. Surman being examined, says, that it appears by books Of Turner, Caswall, and company, ' that sfrom the beginning of February 1719, to the 7th of March following, there was an account, kept by them in the examinant’s name, of sundry parcels of South-Sen stock, amounting to 125,000l. stock, for the use, and upon the account, of Mr. Knight, which account he believes to be true. *

That by this account it appears, that upon the 5th of February 1719, Mr. Knight paid, to the said Turner and company the' sum of 67, 020/. Is. 8 d.which he believes might be accordingly paid out of the cash of the South-Sea company; and at the same time Mr. Knight received from Turner and company, a promis-sary note, to transfer 30,000l. South-Sea stock, value received. '

That James Craggs, esq. of the post-office, sent for the examinant about six weeks ago, and (as he believes) after Mr. Craggs had been examined before this Committee, and told him, he believed, that he (the examinant) would be examined in relation to 30,000l. stock, which he (Mr. Craggs) had of Mr. Knight; and be then produced an account, between himself and Mr. Knight, of South-Sea stock bought or taken.in for him/; by which it appeared that he was to have, upon balance, of Mr. Knight, 30,000l. South-S^a stock, for which Mr.Knighr, instead of making a transfer himself, gave him a note under the hand of Jacob Sawbridge, to transfer 30,000l. stock, value received; which note Mr. Craggs shewed him cancelled, and (as the examinant believes) he had since this enquiry began, got it from Sawbridge, which is not customary, notes being always, when discharged, delivered up to the person, under whoso hand they are, and should remain with them as vouchers,

The examinant says, he verily believes the said note of 30,000l. shewn him by Mr. Craggs, was the same note which Mr. Knight received from Tamer and company, upon his paying then) the before-mentioned sum of 67, 020/. Is.

8 d. That during the time that the proposals of the South-Sea Company, and the bill thereto relating, was depending in parliament, be observed the said Mr. Craggs more frequently with Mr. Knight, than any body else; and believes he influenced Mr. Knight in many things relating to stock and subscriptions. That Mr. Craggs never mentioned this 30,000l. stock to the examinant, till since the said Mr. Craggs’s examination before the Committee. He says, he had not any dealings with Mr. Craggs upon Kis own aceount, but that such transfers of Stock, as he has made to Mr. Craggs, were fnade by Mr. Knight’s directions; and particularly a sum of4,000l. stock transferred the 4th of March 1719, (being part of the sums mentioned in the said Appendix, No i.) That he does not know that Mr. Craggs paid any money for this stock, and whether it was Mr. gnight’s or the Company’s stock, the examinant cannot tell.

Sir John Blunt being examined, says, that he

was not privy to any of Mr. Craggs’s transactions, but has very often seen him at Mr. iKnight’s. As to the 30,000l. stock mentioned in the account now produced to him, and said to be transferred to Mr. Craggs by Mr. Saw-bridge, he says, he can give no account thereof, save that be believes k is the same sum, mentioned in his former examination, to be held for the said Mr. Craggs. That he believes the paid 30,000 I.stock was bought by Mr. Knight, ♦be 8th day of February 1719, upon his own account, and is not charged to be sold by the Company, till the 27 th day of February; (which is the time thet Mr. Craggs desired the quantity 1>f stock, as the examinant has said in his former examination) from which time, till the 23th of March following, he believes it was held by the South-Sea Company, for the benefit of Mr. Craggs, to whom it appears to be transferred by Mr. Saw bridge on the said 28ib of March. That Sawbridge and Company, were common names made use of by several persons, as trustees, to conceal the true buyers or sellers of South-Sea stock.

Mr. James Grammer being examined as to the sum of 2,000l. South-Sea stock, transferred by him to James Craggs, sen. esq. on the 4th day of February, 1719, he says, that he did on the 3d or 4th of February, 1719, sell 2,000l. South-Sea stock, and that sir George C as wall paid him the money for it. That upon inspection of the transfer books of the South-Sea Company, on the day of hisexamination (being the 19th of April instant) lie finds that he transferred the said 2,000l. stock to Mr. Craggs.

Your committee further represent to the House, that they have discovered that the said Mr. Craggs had very considerable dealing in South-Sea stock, with Mr. Matthew Weymoud-

sold, a broker, between the SOth ef January 1719, and the 30th of May following, amounting to 45,000l. stock; an account whereof, as the same has been delivered to your Commhtee, by. the said Mr. Weymondsold *, is hereunto annexed in the Appendix, No. II. And your Cohm mittee examining the said Mr. VVeymondsold, he says, that on the 26th of February 1719, James Craggs, sen. esq. gave the examinant< direction to buy 20,000l. South-Sea stock for him; that the examinant did. accordingly buy on that day 10,000l. South-Sea stock, for Mr* Craggs, for 17, 422/. 10$.; 4000/. of which waa transferred by Mr. Surraan to Mr. Craggs, tha 4th of March 1719, by order of the examinant^ for which stock the examinant received of Mr. Craggs the sum of 6, 945/. and paid tha sum to Mr. Surman, and the other 6,000 stock the examinant delivered to Turner and corns pany, by the order of and for the use of the? said Mr. Craggs; and Turner and company paid the examinant, by Mr. Craggs’* order# 10, 305/. for the same: That the examinant not buying the whole 20,000l. so soon as Mr. Gragg* expected, the said Mr. Craggs told the examin naat, that Mr. John Humphreys had bought for him the other 10.000/. I hat the exarntt nant did, on the 4th of March 1719, by order of the 9aid Mr. Craggs, deliver ts Mr. Knight# another sum of 10,000l. South-Sea stock, for the use of the said Mr. Craggs, and that Mi> Knight paid the examinant 17, 00Oi. for thq same, that twe or three days afterwards* tha examinant, by directions of the said Mr* Craggs, took of Mr. Humphreys the said 10,000l. South-Sea stock, which he had bought for Mr. Craggs, and paid him 17, 500/. tha said stock, being the money which he (the examinant) had before received of Mr. Knight at aforesaid.

Your committee, in the course of their eat quiry, finding it necessary to be informed what quantities of stock James Graggs, sen. esq. dev ceased, had in his own right, at the time of hia death, directed the proper officers of the South* Sea Company, East-India Company, and Bank of England, to lay before them accounts thereof respectively, to the end your Committee might put what relates to the said James Craggs in at dear a light as possible, before‘this Hornsey, which accounts are as follows, via.

Stock in the South-Sea Company, 87,000l.

Stock in the East-India Company, 34,000l.

Stock in the Bank of England, 1,000l.

Amounting in the whole-to 122,000l. capital stock: Accounts whereof are hereunto annex* ed in the before mentioned Appendix No. I, and in the Appendix No. III.

Your Committee finding that several broker* and others had been concerned in partnership with Mr. Knight, in buying and selling grant quantities of South-Sea stock, and hi giving out money for refusals, your Committee pnooeeded to examine the several persons following, relating thereto.

Mr. Edward Owen being examined, says, that he was eoaceraed jointly with Mr. Uoldtuah

and Mf. Knight, in buying about 20,000l.

. South-Sea stock, in December 1719, which he believes at the time of buying was to have been equally divided among them j but in a few days altering their miud, the same stock was sold -Out at 85/. loss.

That Mr. Knight some time after told the examinant, he had bought some stock for himself, and if the examinant would have a part of it, Mr. Knight said, he would deliver it to hitn at the same price he paid for it, and the exami. aant did accordingly take of Mr. Knight6,000/ at 134 to 135, and 4,000l. at 177 to 178, which several prices he paid Mr. Knight by adjustment.

That Mr. Knight told the examinant be had bad a transaction in South-Sea stock (as the examinant believes) by which Mr. Knight gain-«d 9, 500/. or thereabout^ and that he paid the examinant 1, 215/. 10s. 6d. for his own use, telliag the examinant, that it was his share of that profit.

He says, that at the shutting of the books, in December 1719, it was a general talk, /that something would be done to mend the South-Sea stock, and that be then heard it was likely some proposals would be offered to the House of Commons relating to that matter: Being asked from whom be heard it, says, be believes he might have heard it from Mr. Knight, and probably from some of the directors.

That some time before Christmas 1719, there was a quantity of South-Sea stock bought and sold, in which this examinant, Mr. Knight, and Mr. Strode, were concerned with Turner and company, by which transaction the examinant gained for his part (to the best of his remem* brance) between and 500/.

That after the shutting of the South-Sea books, in December 1719, Mr. Strode bought large quantities of Soutlt-Sea stock, at different prices, some of which stock was sold, and the remainder taken andpaid for; that these transactions wete on the account of the examinant, Mr. Strode, Turner and company, and Mr. Knight, who were equally concerned: Thpc in the month of February, they oame to an adjust* ment, and upon making up the whole account of stock bought and refusals given, the examinant received 10, 500/. South-Sea stock as his share, upon payhig Mr. Strode 6,000l. or thereabouts: And as to the particulars of such transactions, he refers himself to Mr. Strode, who kept the account.

The said Samuel Strod, being examined, •ays, that he did on the 96th of February 1719, buy of George Steed 1, 500/. stock at 170J, of Thomas Carbonnel 9,000l. at the same price; of Abraham Cordoso 2,000l. and of Moses Barrow, 14, 500/. at the same price, which sums were so bought by him on account of Elias Turner, sir George Caswell, Mr. Sawbridge, and the examinant, who were partners therein, an' equal four parts *

That oa the 31st of March 1730, Mr. Tes-tard, a broker, bought by this examinant’s direction, and far his ipe^the following sums vis.

the South Sen Company* p9G

1,000l. at 304 per cent. 5,000l. at 305, 2,000l. at 306, 6,000l. at 308, and 6,000l. at 310; and the same day the examinant bought himself for hi9 own use 901/. at 309, of Edward Adderly, 200/j at 308, of James Round; that he paid for all these suras by money or adjustments.

And this examinant says, that he did on tha 95th of March 3 720, buy of Mr. Knight 1,000l. South Sea slock, for his own use, at the rate of 310/. per cent. And the examinant says, that he was concerned in buying-and selling several large quantities of South Sea stock, and in giving out money for refusals of- stock, iu partnership with the said Turner, Caswall, and Saw-bridge, Mr. Knight, and Mr. Owen, via. tha said Turner, Caswall, and Sawbridge, and tha examinant in one half, and Mr. Knight, andx Mr. Owen, ib the other half; the total of tha stock, bought by them, and money given for refusals, amounting to about 695,000l. stock, accounts whereof are to this examination annexed, and signed by him, which accounts, ha says, are true.

Mr. Bichard HoldUch , a late director, being examined, says, be was one concerned in buying and selling 15 or 90,000l. South Sea stock, and says be was concerned another time with Mr. Knight, in Holland, in buying stock there, and selling it again, of which his part was about 26,000l. stock, by which the examinant gained about 5,000 I.and says he knows of no other transaction with Mr. Knight, or Mr. Owen, either in stock or subscriptions, since Michaelmas 1719.

Your Committee being informed, that Joseph Shaw, broker, had been very much concerned, in buying and selling South Sea stock for Msw Knight, they sent for the said Shaw, who being examined, says, that he had very large transactions with Mr. Knight, but Mr. Knight charged him not to keep any account in his books, nor has the exhminant any cash account with Mr. Knight, entered in any of his books, but gave it in, from day to day, on sheets of paper; that he always paid or gave notes or bills on goldsmiths for the stock and subscriptions which he from time to time, sold for Mr. Knight, and which was delivered; that Mr. Knight was very angry with this examinant, on his giving into the House of Lords an account of stock sold by him for Mr. Knight; that he desired the examinant to defer giving in the said account to the Lords, and that he would give him the names of persons for whom the stock was sold, which he should insert in that account: But this examinant did not receive such names from him. That this examinant was with Mr. Knight several times, two or three days before he went away, and Mr. Knight desired to see the account which this examinant intended to give in to the House of Lords, of stock bought and sold for him: that about the Thursday before Mr. Knight went away, this examinant inquired, at the treasury office, where Mr. Koight was; and was told, he was gone to the other end of the town; by which he understands, to some in the ministry, or the treasury; produced

his ledger-book, in the alphabet of which, Mr, Knight’s name is entered; bat the three leaves, to which it refers, are torn out: Says, Those leaves were torn out by him, before the sitting of parliament, by Mr. Knight’s direction, in the treasury, or some other room in the South Sea house: Says, There might be something and some other names, in those three leaves, which are not in the paper produced by him at his examination:That he knows of no lord, nor commoner, named in those three leaves, save what are in the said paper produced; which paper, he says, be took from his journal, from which the entries were posted into the said three leaves of the said ledger; but cannot say, that the same is an exact copy: produced several other books, several of the leaves of which are torn out, which concern Mr. Knight: That this examinant never kept a cash-book in his life: That all stock, bought and sold, is transferred or posted from his journal, produced at his examination, into his said ledgers: but the journal does not contain all the matters concerning money, that are entered in his ledgers: That page 80 and 81 are torn out. of one of his ledgers ? That page 9, 10, 'and 11, are torn out of another of his ledgers: That page 1, 2, 9, 4. 8, and 9, are torn out of another ledger, marked 3.: as also page 7, defaced; all which ages, he remembers, contained accounts of liv Knight; and are referred to in the several alphabets of those ledgers: That all these

ledgers b< gin in January 1719.

Your Committee have other matters under their consideration, upon which $iey are proceeding; and will, in a short time, lay die tame before the House.

The said Report was ordered to be taken into consideration upon this day t'evennighr.

Delate in the Common* on the State of the Public Credit^] April 25. Mr. Shippen stood up, and took notice, That the House had sate a long while, and nothing had yet been done towards the restoring of Public Credit: that, indeed, a. member of great parts and abilities had, at first, proposed a Scheme for that purpose; but that, instead of proving an effectual remedy, it appeared at last to be a mere palliar five, which had rather inflamed than alleviated the distemper: that by this time, a whole injured nation called aloud for vengeance; and if they neglected to bear the voice of the people, it would look as if they had a mind to provoke them to do themselves justice. That it was. ever his opinion, that the only effectual means to restore Credit, was to call those to a strict Account, who had ruined it; and, in particular, all such as had applied any part of the public money, iotrusted in their hands, in stock jobbing, and had raised vast fortunes by robbing the Public. And so be moved, “ Thatit be an instruction to the Committee of Secrecy, that they inquire what public money had been employed by any treasurer, cashier, collector, receiver, or other officer concerned in the receipt or payment of the public money, or of any

other part of his majesty’s revenue, or by any^ in trust for them, or by their order, in buying stock .or subscriptions m the Sooth Sea, or any other company, or in annuities, or other parliamentary securities, or otherwise making use of, or employing the same, to tbpir private advantage, since the 1st of December, 1719.”

Sir William Wyndham seconded this motion; adding withal, “ That there was reason to apprehend, that the public money bad not been administered with due (economy, particularly is relation to some foreign Troops* that were in the pay of England and Holland, daring the last war, to whom great sums had of late bees allowed, on account of pretended arrears, after they had separated from the English general: and therefore he moved, That the late Commissioners appointed to examine, »taiex and de* termine the Debts due to the Army, and ts examine and state the demands of several foreign princes and States, for subsidies, during the late war, be ordered to lay before the House Copies of the several warrants and sign-manuals, by virtue of which they issued any certificates.” Hereupon,

Mr. R. Walpole said, That he wondered to hear of such a motion, when a little after tho king’s coming to the crown, an act of parliament had been made for payment of those arrears; and that^the commissioners of accounts had, undoubtedly, acted according to the intent, and meaning of that act. To this

Mr. Lechmere replied. That he was not against the motion that sir William Wyndham had made, neither on the other hand, was be. about to justify it: but he would freely tell the gentleman (meaning Mr. R. Walpole) who opposed it. That while the nation was under the pressure of heavy debts, he most expect that many such motions would be made, in order to find out methods to ease the public burden. That as that gentleman was now in a higher post than formerly, so a great deal more was expected from him; the rather because the Scheme which be had proposed atthe beginning of this session, for the raising the stocks, and restoring public credit, bad not had the desired effect.

Mr. R. Walpole replied. That it was known to every body, that he ever was against tho South Sea scheme, and had done all that i» hie power lay, to hinder its taking place:but now the mischief was done, and things were brought to such extremities, he thought it his duty, and therefore was willing to try the best method he could think of, to extricate the nation out the difficulties into which they were plunged t that he did not pretend to work miracles; but only to use his utmost endeavours towards retrieving the late misfortunes: That with thin honest intention, he had promoted & scheme which bad been laid before him, and appeared tbg most plausible of any then proposed, for restoring public credit: That it could not be denied, that'while that scheme was pursued, it had done some good, and kept up the price of stocks; and that they fell since it . had been?

laid aside. That, however, he never intended to raise stocks above the intrinsic value, for that would bring us again into the same unhappy circumstances which the raising of them ban before occasioned. He afterwards lamented the ill disposition of some persons, who, instead of concurring with others in remedying the present distempers, used all possible means to irritate and exasperate the minds of the people: and concluded with amotion “ That a day be appointed to consider of the State of the Public Credit of the Kingdom.” This motion was unanimously agreed to, and that day seven-sight appointed for that purpose.

The Comment take into Consideration that Pari of the Reports of the Committee of Secrecy which relates to Mr., sen:] April

88. The Commons proceeded to take into consideration those parts of the Reports of the Committee of Secrecy, as related to James Craggs, esq. deceased, late Post-Master-General, which having been read, Mr. Broderick moved, That the said Mr. Craggs having taken 40,000l. South Sea stock, without paying for it, or giving sufficient security for the payment of the same, his estate might be made liable to the same forfeitures with those of the late Directors. Hereupon

Mr. Grey Neville desired, That the gentlemen concerned in this affair, two of whom were members of the House, might first be heard by their counsel, and produce what witnesses they had, before the House came to any resolution in this matter.

Mr. Robert Walpole seconded him, and in particular, said, He hoped the House would not break their known rules, which were, not to condemn any one without first hearing them; and sure they would not deny this piece of fustice to their own members.

Mr. Horatio Walpole spoke to the same purpose; and then

Mr. Trefutis, member for Penryn, stood up,

and said, That neither he nor Mr. Newsham were at all prepared, not expecting that this affair would have come on this day, because there was another part in the Report before it, and therefore he desired the House would give them time to get their witnesses: He added, He never had been used to speak in the House, or hut very rarely, and his brother-in law, Mr. Newsham, member for Lestwithiel, not at all, which he hoped the House would take into consideration, and allow them counsel to speak for them:That by Mr. Craggs’s death, his estate was ‘devolved to them and Mr. Elliot, in right of their wives, the deceased’s three daughters: That there was no manner of crime laid to their charge; and since Mr. Craggs was dead, 1 and could not answer for himself, he hoped die House would allow them time and counsel.

This was opposed by sir Joseph Jekyll: but

Mr. Robert Walpole said, That since the two gentlemen concerned had not been used to speak lathe House, and therefore were not likely to

make so good a defence as otherwise they might, he thought it reasonable to allow them, counsel, and give them time to prepare. To> this

Mr. Lechmerereplied, That it might, indeed *

seem somewhat bard to deny counsel to gentlemen who were not used to speak in the House; but he doubted not but that good natured gentleman that spoke last, who had so good a capacity, and was so able to advise them, would sit by them, and by his assistance be as useful to them, as if they had counsel, as he had been to several others in the like case.

No return was made to this reply, upon whick the motion for allowing counsel was dropt.

The Commons resolve that the Estate of the late Mr. Craggs be applied to the Relief " South Sea Sufferers.] >May 1. The order of the day for'taking into consideration those parts of the Reports from the Committee of Secrecy, which related to Mr. James Craggs, deceased, late postmaster general, being read, and several evidences being examined, the House came to the Following Resolutions:

1. uThat it appears to the House, that James Craggs, esq. late postmaster general, did, in February 1719, during the time that the proposals of the South Sea Company were depending in parliament, with a corrupt intention, apply to and solicit Robert Knight, late cashier of the said Company, for a large quantity of South Sea stock, to be held by the said Company forhis own use and benefit.

2. “ That on or about the 27th of February, 1711, a sum of 30,000l. capital stock of the South Sea Company, which bad been taken in, an^ paid for out of the cash of the said Company, was, upon, the solicitation of the said James Craggs, held by the said Company for the use and benefit of the said James Craggs, which said 30,000l. stock was afterwards, on the 28th of March, 1720, transferred to the said James Craggs.

5. “ That all the Estate, real and personal, of which the said James Craggs was seized or possessed from and after the 1st day of Dec. 1719, (over and above what he stood seized or possessed of on the said 1st day of December) be applied for and towards the relief of the unhappy sufferers, in the Sooth Sea Company, and for deterrin^all persons from committing the like wicked practices for time to come, ”

Debate in the Commons on the State of the Public Credit.] May 9. The Commons, in a Committee of the whole House, took into consideration the Public Credit of this kingdom, and after reading the Proceedings and Resolutions of the general court of the South Sea Company, held the 23rd of December, 1720, as also the Resolutions of the general court of the said Company, held the 9th and 18th days of March, 1790, relating to the four money-subscriptions,

Mr. Sloper opened the debate, and took notice, that one of the principal causes of the ruin of Public Credit, was the fraudulent dealing of the South Sea directors, with the proprietors of the redeemables, and other public debts, and with the money-subscribers. He was seconded by the Master of the Rolls, and backed by Mr. Hutcheson and the Chancellor of the Duchy, who all concluded, that some relief ought to be given to the said subscribers.

Mr. Milner was of the same opinion, and thereupon moved, that the seven millions due from the South Sea Company to the government be remitted. This was strenuously opposed by

Mr. Smithy who shewed how absurd it was, to pretend to retrieve Public Credit, by remitting, that is by taking from the public, so great a sum, to give it to private persons: be owned that they who had suffered by the fraud and mismanagement of the late South Sea directors, were worthy objects of compassion; but that they ought to be relieved out of the estates of those who bad occasioned their losses, and not out of the public money.

This was answered by Mr. Horatio Walpole, Who was for Mr. Milner’s motion; as were also the lord Tyrconnel, Mr. Pulteney, Mr. Robert Walpoje; col. Bladen, and some others, and though they were opposed by Mr. Shippen, aerjeant Pengtlly, and a few more, yet the question being put, .upon Mr. Milner’s motion, it was carried in the affirmative by 221 voices against 194. *

Papers relating to Mr. Knight presented.] May 6. Mr. Methuen, by the king’s command, laid before the House copies of several Letters and Papers relating to Mr. Knight, which: were read; particularly, a Letter from Mr. Leathes, the British resident at Brussels, Containing an account of the excuses and pre-

* “ The most remarkable passage in this day’s debate, was Mr. Sbippen’s naming a

Great Lady, who hail a considerable quantity of South Sea stock given her; and afterwards telling a story of Alice Pearce, a celebrated mistress of king Henry III. who having made a breach between the king and the Black Prince, was twice removed from court, by the interposition and solicitation of the then Speaker of the House of Common*^ This story being looked upon as implying an odious parallel, col.

fences made use of to elude his instances for the delivering up of the said Mr. Knigbfc Those excuses were thought so frivolous, that m motion was made for prohibiting the importation of aU commodities of the growth and maw nufacture of the Austrian Netherlands, particularly lace and lawn, till such time as Miv Knight had been delivered up and seat over t but it was thought more proper, that a Committee be appointed to consider of the State of the Trade between this kingdom and the Austrian Netherlands, and to report the same, as it should appear to them, to the House; which Committee was appointed.

A Motion in favou r of Mr. Aislabie rejected.'] Then a motion was made, that it might be an instruction to the Grand Committee on the Bill, ‘ For the relief of the unhappy sufferers/ &c. that they should receive a clause, that the

fraternal estate of Mr. Aislabie might not bp-iable to the same forfeitures with the other park of his estate; but though this motion wab strongly supported by three members, yet it wab rejected with general indignation.

Mr. Vernon expelled the Houset for a Cor~ rupt Application in favour of Mr. Aislabie.} May 8. Sir Joseph Jekyll, master of the rolls, acquainted the House, that he was directed bj the Committee of Secrecy to acquaint the House, of an application made to a member of the said Committee, relating to a matter depending before this House, and thereupon named the hon. general Rosse, as the gentleman to whom such application was made i whereupon

General Rosse acquainted the House that that morning, while lie was at the said Committee, he received a note, that a gentleman was at the door to speak with hirc^and he went out, and found there Thomas Vernon, esq. a member of this House, who desired him to go into a little room near, whither he went; and Mr. Vernon acquainted him, that be had something to say to him, which be desired might go no farther; whereupon general' Rosse told him, he hoped he had nothing to say to him which might be improper for him to hear; after which, Mr. Vernon told him, there was a disposition in the House to be favourable to Mr. Aislabie, in the Bill upon which the House was to be. in a Committee that day, and that it waa in his power to do him service, and. for the same, Mr. Aislabie would make him any acknowledgment, and ia any manner be should think fit; upon which Mr. Rosse, from what he first said, concluding it was upon some corrupt matter, left bite in passion, and thought it his duty to acquaint the Committee of Secrecy therewith* and the said Committee thought it was proper to- have2 the matter laid before the House. To this matteir Mr. Vernon was heard in his place, aad owned the skid Words and circumstances; withal declaring, That he did not mention or intend any thing of money, or any other corrupt raattoyaad begged the panic* of thege *

tlernan and of the House, if he had committed any offence, he saying the words without any corrupt iaseutioa, and only on account of friendship, being nearly related to Mr. Aisla-feie, aad then Mr. Vernon withdrew.

Hereupon it was resolved, “ l.-That it appears to this House, that Thomas Vernon* esq. a member of this House, hath made a corrupt application to general Rosse, a member of this House, and one of the Committee of Secrecy, in relation to a matter depending before this House. 8. That the said Thomas Vernon, esq. be for his said offence expelled this House.v It was also ordered, u That tbd thanks of this House be given to general Rosse, for the jusr tie* he had done to thi6 House and to his country, in laying the application made to him by Thomas Vernon, esq. before this House/' And Jdr, Speaker gave him the thanks of the House accordingly.

After this, the Commons, in a grand committee, made some progress in the Bill for relief of the unhappy Sufferers in the South Sea Company, &c. and added Mr. Aislabie’s name and estate.

. Fourth Report of the Committee of Secrecy on the Proceedings of theSouthSer Company*] May 22. Mr. Clayton, Chairman <of the Committee of Secrecy, during the indisposition of Mr. Rrodrick, delivered to the House the following Report:

^ Fourth Report of th* Committee of Secrecy on the Proceedings of the South Sea Company. ,

The Committee of Secrecy appointed to enquire into all the proceedings relating to the Execution of an Act, passed in the last session of parliament, intitled, “ An Act for enabling the South Sea Company to increase their present capital stock, and fund, by redeeming such public debts and incumbrances as are therein mentioned; and for raising money, be applied for lessening several of the public debts and incumbrances; and for calling in the present Exchequer Bills remaining uncancelled; and for making forth new Bills, in lieu thereof, to be circulated and exchanged, upon demand, at or near the Exchequer ; n since their former Report, having had intimation given them,

’ That several large sums of money had been Jem to divers persons mentioned in the book of loans, formerly .laid before this House by the late Directors of the South Sea Company; tfor security whereof no stock hath been actually transferred; they did, by their order bearing date the 24th day of April last past, xkrect the present Sub Governor, Deputy Governor, and Directors, of the South Sea Company, to lay before them an account of the names of all persons who are mentioned in 4he said book of loans to have borrowed money tea stuck, and the sums by them respectively borrowed, for security wheredf no actual trans-

fer ofstock had been made; pursuant to which order, upon the 19th day of May'instant, th* said court ef Directors did lay before your Committee a book, by them intitled, An Ac*/ ‘ count of the names of such persons to whom:

‘ loans have been made on South Sea stock;

‘ who, at the time when such loans were made,

* do not appear, by any hooks, to have trans-

* ferredstock to the South Sea Company, forth *

‘ security thereofAnd the court of Director* have added to the said title the words following,

* But, as all or most of the money lent was by

* granting permits to any name without distinc-

* tion, or. any regard had by whom the stock ‘ was transferred; it is doubted, that this ac-

* count may be very defective; and it is pro *

‘ bable, that many of the names herein may

* be fictitious, and thdt many others may be ‘ able te shew how, and by whom, the stock

* for the money lent them respectively was

* really transferred, if they should be called ‘ upon so to do/ And your committee observe, that the last mentioned book contains' the names of several persons mentioned in the aforesaid book of loans, to have borrowed money upon stock, to the amount of 9, 181, 9442. 11s. upon the security of 578, 8882. stock, which doth not appear to have been transferred to the use of the Company,

And in relation to this matter your Commit* tee proceeded to examine, in the most solemn manner, the several persons following, and do now lay before the House, the examination by them taken, in the words of the examinatione themselves.

Mr. Charles Lockyer, accountant to the South Sea Company, says, that be hath carefully examined the books of loans, and the books of transfers of the said Company, by order of the Committee of Secrecy; and upon the inspection of the said books does find, that the sum of 2, 181, 914/. 11s. has been lent by the said Company, at several times, to the par* ticular persons mentioned in an account drawn out by this examinant, upon the sum of 578, 888/. stock, supposed to be transferred to the use of the said Company, as a security for such money; but this examinant, upon the strictest examination of the books aad accounts belonging to the South Sea Company, cannot find or discover, that any of the said persona, or any ether for them, at the respective times of the loans made to them, did make, or cause to be made, any transfer of such stock, upon which the said loans are entered to be made, or of any stock whatsoever, unto nr for the use of the Company, for securing the repay* ment of the money then borrowed, amounting in the whole to the aforesaid sum of 9, 161, 9442. 11s. And this examinant does Dot know that any stock was transferred by, or for the said persons, for the security of the said money, or any part thereof.

Sir John Blunt being examined, says, he takes it, there was a good deal of money lent to the persons who had bought stock; and ia such case the real borrower* were not the

TUt)J PARL. HIST.'7 George I. 1721. — Debate concerning the'Estate*. [500

transferrers, but the persons of whom they had bought, transferred the stock to Mr. Knight, Surman, or Powell, for securing the money lent by the Company. He says, he Really believes that Mr. Knight generally made good the stock which he has charged the Company to have lent money upon, though be has heard1 that some persons are charged with bor-. rowing money, who never did borrow any. He says, he believes there is a considerable quantity of stock on which money is said to he lent, where no stock is transferred; and the examinant apprehends that great part of that deficiency will be found among the 574, 500 fictitious stock, said to be sold, which he believes has been transferred to the loan account.

Mr. Robert Surman, being examined, as to the account of loans where no transfers appear to be. made, pays, that he believes that Mr. Knight, having accounts of stock with several persons, he carried their stock to the account of loans. He says, when the loans were at first began to be made, there were several waste books kept, wherein the sums lent out were first entered, and all the papers and memorandums relating to the loans were given to Mr. Clayton, a clerk in the South Sea house, but he does not remember whether he has seen those books siuce the enquiry began or no. He says, that the ledgers of the loans (he believes) were made up about: a month before Mr. Knight went away: Says, he believes that several of the persons who had the ficti|ioas stock, had money lent upon it on the Company's account; and in such cases no transfers could be made; and he believes that part of the 578, 888/. stock, on which money has been lent without transfers (appearing in the account now produced to him) is part of the 574, 500/. fictitious stock.

The said Christopher Clayton, being hereupon examined by your Committee, says, be and the clerks under him, did, by direction of the committee of loans, and of Mr. Knight, make up the account of loans from books which he now believes are at the South Sea house, in thecustody of Mr. DeGols; that the instructions given him, were to make the ac* coant from the copies of the journals: that Mr. Knight perused this account when made, and examined it, and corrected it .by the journals and other books of his own; that Mr. Knight had the custody of the original'journals; and before the copies from which this examinant took the account were made, the examinant believes that Mr. Knight made some additions to the original journals from his own books. Says, that he never had any instructions or x>rder from Mr. Knight, or any other person, to make this account in such a manner, as not to exceed the regulations of 400/. per cent.

After reading the said Report, Mr. Clayton acquainted the House, that the Committee were preparing a draught of a Report, relating

to several members of both Houses, mentioned vin the account of stack sold, laid before this House, and relating to a(l other members of this House mentioned in -any examination taken by the said committee, and desired the House to appoint a day for receiving such Report:whereupon it was ordered, that the said Report be received upon that day fortnight.

Debate in the Commons concerning the Mloth-ances to be given to the South Sea Directors out of their Estates.*] May 23. In a grand Committee, a farther progress was made in the Bill, For the Relief of the unhappy Sufferers in the South Sea Company; * and the chief matter in debate was, what allowance should be given to the late directors out of their estates ?

Mr. Lowndes proposed an eighth part; to which it was objected, That it would be too much for some who had the most- bulky estates, and consequently bad been deepest in the guilt; and too little for others that had but small estates, and were only passively criminal, by not entering their dissent to' the fraudulent management of the rest.

May 25. The Commons, in a grand Conn mitte, on the South Sea Sufferers’ Bill, resumed the consideration of the Petitions of the late Directors of the South Sea Company. The debate began with sir John Fellows, the subgovernor, m whose behalf

Mr. Sloper moved, That since it .did not appear that he had been so active in the late vile and pernicious practices as some others had, he might be allowed 20,000l. out of his estate.

Mr. Hungerford reduced it to 15,000l. others to 12,000l. and Mr. Robert Walpole having at

* “After all the pains that have been taken to detect the villainies of the Directors and their friends, I am afraid they will at last slip through their fingers, and that nothing further will be done as to confiscation, hanging, &c. There certainly is a majority in the House of Commons, that are willing to do themselves and the kingdom justice; but they act so little in concert together, that they are constantly baffled by a set of men whom guilt, money, &c. have linked in the closest bond. _ It is impossible to tell you of what infinite consequence the absence of a friend of yours, is at this time, and how uneasy the generality of mankind is at it. He is, without compliment^ the spring that gives motion to the whole body; and the only man that either can or will set matters in a true light, and expose and baffle the schemes of the Skreen, &c. — The House were five hours in a committee last Friday upon the director’s bill, and were amused and bantered the whole time by questions and amendments proposed by the Skreen, &c. so that they rose at last without coming to any resolution.” Coxe*s Walpole. Correspondence: Mr, St, John Brodrick to lord Middleton,

last proposed 10,000l. the same was agreed to without any division. Mrr Joye, deputy-governor, appearing to have been deeply concerned in the guilt, it was agreed to 'allow him only 5,000l.

Then the Committee proceeded alphabetically to the directors, and it was unanimously agreed to allow Mr. Astell 5,000l.

A debate arising, whether to allow sir Lam-, bert Blackwell 5,000l. or 10,000l. and he having many friends in the House, it was, upon a division, carried for 10,000l. by 112 votes against 108.

After this, there was a long debate about cir John Blunt; Mr. Laurence Carter moved to allow him only Is.; lord James Cavendish 1,000l. and Mr. Plummer 5,000l.; sir Joseph Jekyll moved for 10,000l.; and was seconded by general Ross, lord. Molesworth, Mr. Jefferies, and Mr. Windsor, who all spoke very warmly on his behalf; alledging, that he had been more ingenuous in his examination before the Secret Committee, than any of the late directors; and had let them into a great many secrets, which otherwise they could not have known. To this it was answered, by Mr. Sloper, Mr. Milner, Mr; John Smith, and Mr. IJoratio Walpole, “ That he had been the chief contriver and promoter of all the mischief, and therefore ought to be most severely punished/' ff Mr. Sloper added, That he was grown to V; t^at height of pride and insolence last summer, l.that be could not give a civil answer to persons > far above him. And thereupon instanced in his r-behaviour one day, at the treasury, of which he K'was himself witness, when a relation of a great f man, asking sir John for a subscription, the 1 upstart knight, with a great deal of contempt, 4/hid him go to his cousin Walpole, and desire, ' i him to sell his stock in the Bank, and by that | means he might be supplied. Hereupon

•Mr. Robert Walpole shewed, That sir John Blunt was a projector of many years standing; and had been the author of several fallacious schemes, by which unwary people had been drawn in to their utter ruin. And to this purpose, iustauccd a project for a linen manufactory; but

. Mr. Horatio Walpole said thereupon, That was not his first; for there was a gentleman that sat next to him, [meaning Mr. Jessop] whom sir John had drawn into a project for bringing Water* to London from a great distance, which was to out-do the New River Water, by which the subscribers lost all their money, though sir John himself got some thousands by it.

This was confirmed by Mr. Jessop himself; nevertheless, the

Lord Hinchingbroke moved for allowing sir

John Blunt JO,000l. urging, That the Secret Committee had promised him favour for his openness in his examination; upon which General Ross desired, That the noble member who spoke last might explain himself, since be seemed to intimate, as if the Secret Committee had used underhand dealings. Adding,

You YIL

that for his part he kneyv of' no promise ever made to sir John Blunt upon that account; that be was sure he never made aqy; and he believed he could auswer for all the rest, that there never was any such thing intimated tc sir John.

The Lord Hinchingbroke replied; that if that honourable member would repeat his words as he spoke them, he would ex plain'himself: .

Upon which the matter dropped. Then the question being put, for allowing sir John Blunt 1,000l. it was carried in the affirmative, by 138 votes against 94.

It was observed, that Mr. Lechmere, .Mr. Hutcheson, and serjeant Pengelly went oat of the House, before the debate about particular persons came on; and that Mr. Lechmere only took notice, “ That the late directors were all equally guilty of a breach of trust, and therefore ought all to be punished; but that their crimes not being equally flagrant, he thought there ought to be a difference in their punishment.”

Fifth Report op the Committee op Secrecy on the Proceedings of the South-Sea Company.] May 26. Mr. Clayton, from the Committee of Secrecy, reported to the House, That.it appeared to the said Committee that Mr. Christopher Clayton, a Clerk in the treasury office of the South-Sea Company, bad endeavoured, by Threats and Menaces, to suppress the Evidence which Samuel Watts, another clerk in the said office, was able to give to the said Committee; which report he read in his place, as follows:viz.

Fifth Report of the Committee of Secrecy on the Proceedings op the South-Sea Company.

That the Committee of Secrecy appointed to inquire into all the proceedings relating to the execution of an Act passed the last session of parliament, intiiled, “ An Act for enabling the South-Sea Company to increase their present Capital Stock, and Fund, by redeeming such public Debts and Incumbrances as are therein mentioned; and for raising Money, to be applied for. lessening several of the public Debts and Incumbrances; and forcallingin the present Exchequer-Bills remaining uncahcelled; and for making forth new Bills, in lieu thereof, to be circulated and exchanged, upon demand, at or near the Exchequer; Having, on the 25ih of May instant, examined, in the most solemn manner, Samuel Waits, a clerk in the Treasury-Office of the South-Sea Company; he says, That, sorhe time in January last, about a fortnight afte^the first meeting of the Secret Committee, at the South-Sea House, Mr. -Lockyer came up into the Treasury-room, from the Secret Committee, and said. They wanted Mr. Christopher Clayton, then a clerk to the South-Sea Company:Who not being there, he asked for the examinant; who said, “ Here am IAnd then Mr. Lockyer inquired of the examinant, Who the

clerks were that made out the Books of Loans:and the examinant acquainted him, that himself, James Ottey, George Wol-ley, and Stephen Crisp, were clerks em-’ ployed in making out those books; and then' Mr. Lockyer went down stairs, and desired the examinant not to be out of the way:that, soon after, the said Mr.’Clayton came in; and the examinant told him, The committee wanted him below stairs:Clayton then asked him, if the examinant knew for what the committee wanted him:the examinant replied, he did not know; but that Mr. Lockyer bad desired him to attend:upon which Clayton said, He had heard the examinant had given Mr. Lockyer the names of the clerks who assisted him in making out the books of Loans: upon this, Clayton said, with a curse, “ What had jou to do to tell their names? If you had a mind to bring yourself into a premunire, why should you bring them ? Am not I sufficient to give an account for them ?" And, walking about the room in a passion, said, That the examinant had nothing to do to discover any thing; especially to Mr. Lockyer, who was a rogue, and a villain, and had discovered all:and that he would therefore be despised, and pissed upon, by every, body: and then said, That, if this examinant was summoned before the Committee of Secredy, he was to answer. That he knew nothing, but that the examinant was subordinate to him; and that what the examinant had done, was by his directions, and he was answerable for it; and, laying his hands violently on this examinant’s face, squeezed his jaws very hard, and- said, if the examinant discovered any thing, he would be the death of him:

That Clayton then asked the examinant, What he did know:to which the examinant replied, He knew enough j and that, when he was examined before his betters, he would tell the truth:Clayton asked again, what the examinant did know; to which the examinant answered, lie should know in time.

Your Committee are proceeding in the further Examination of the Matters referred to them; and will speedily lay the same before the House.

Resolution thereon.] The House immediately camel to this Resolution, <* That Mr. Christo-pheHClayton, a clerk in the Treasury-Office of the South-Sea Company, by endeavouring to prevail with Mr. Samuel Watts, another clerk m the said office, by threats and menaces, to suppress the Evidence which he was able to give to the Committee of Secrecy, was guilty of a high Crime and Misdemeanour and it was ordered, t(That the said Mr. Christopher Clayton be, for his said offence, committed Prisoner to his majesty’s prison of the Gute-House.”

Complaint made against certain Seditious Libels in Mist’s Journal.] May 28. Mr. I.echtnere having made a Complaint to the House, of a Paper printed by N. Mist in

Great Carter-Lane, London, intitled, Tfc* “ Weekly Journal, or Saturday’s Post, with “ freshest advices, foreign and domestic;" Saturday, May 27, 1721 ; * the same was brought-up to the Table, and several Paragraphs in the said printed paper were read as follow; viz.

O Socii (neque enim ignari sunuts ante malofum)

O passi graviora ! Dafiit Deus his quoque finem.

“ Friends! Britons! Countrymen!

uGive me leave to salute you with these tender appellations, whilst 1 endeavour to prepare you for the due solemnization of that approaching festival, which commemorates the greatest blessings that Were ever poured forth on this or any other nation.

“ For ever shall the 29 th of May be regarded as the day on which we were delivered from the greatest evils a people had ever laboured under. After wickedness had received its utmost perfection in the destruction of the king; we groaned under the oppressive force of a cruel, ill-bred, uneducated Old Tyrant, and the drivelling fbol his son, whilst the royal progeny wandered from court to court to find protection; their servants at home were enjoined to abjure their title, and swear to afford them no aid. Solemn leagues and covenants were hatched to make the people abjure God as well as the king. To be qualified to serve in Church and State, it was required to deny Religion and Government. Every man would be ruled after his Own model, and have a religion of his own con* trivance. Those who had a little stock of Greek, revived the damnable errors of Simon *M»gus, Arius, Macedonia, &c. whilst tinkers,

* " Whilst the affair of the South-Sea was depending in parliament, Petitions from counties, cities, and boroughs were sent up, crying for justice, and pamphlets were daily published, exasperating the minds of the people against the South-Sea directors and their abettors. But the loudest cries for justice were contained in Letters directed to the Author of the London Journal, and supposed to have been mostly penped by Mr. Gordon, under the borrowed name of Cato. A Committee was appointed to inquire into the authors, printers, and publishers of seditious libels. They sent for Mr. Peele, publisher of the London Journal, and for the reputed author of the Letters, but they bothkep out of the way. Mist, the printer and publisher of a Weekly Journal, was, for reflections cast on the king for his interpositions on behalf of the Protestants in the Palatinate, sentenced to stand in the pillory, to pay a fine of 5Of. and after three months imprisonment to give security for his good behaviour seven years. His Journal was carried on under the title of Fog’s, and two months after (May 27) was censured again by the Commons as a traiterous libel, tending to alienate the affections of his majesty’s subjects, and excite rebellion. However, the Journal continued may years afterwardi.*r Tindal.

coblers, and taylort, made shift to botch and patch up a religion, of their own pure invention. By public authority'we were commanded with fasting and prayer, to implore the divine power to assist in perpetrating the greatest villainies; and when the permissive providence of God had suffered any exemplary roguery to succeed, they did not fail to return him solemn thanks for it. Thus was God's holy name seriously blasphemed, and all who had submitted to the Usurper became.members of a Hell Fire Club.

' * The Tyrant behaved like a knavish guardian, and not like a natural father of the people. He knew not how short his time might be, therefore made the best of it. He pillaged all that came in his way; but as it was impossible to ruin the nation without the assistance of part of i£, he licensed little rogues to strip their neighbours, so thtyrlhey shared the booty vith him. The royal palace was crowded with trulls and scoundrels who would disgrace Bridewell and Newgate. Sach miscreants trod on the coronets of our nobles, revelled on the national spoil, and triumphed in our affliction; whilst the Usurper encouraged this mad riot, acting like a rogue who had taken possession of another’s estate he had no title to, and did not care, what waste he made in another man's grounds. Our lords and gentlemen were made to bleed in wanton sport, for treason committed against his mock majesty.

“ Under these, and innumerable other evils, we were involved. When Rebellion had almost lost its name in a settled and successive usurpation, then we beheld day to break in upon us from afar, when least expected. Then we saw the restoration of the monarchy in the royal house of Stuart, in the person of a prince endowed with a thousand shining qualities. Then those great names, Ormond, Clarendon, and Southampton, honest hearts, and able heads, presided at the helm of affairs. The college of b&hops was filled more worthily than in any nge since the apostolical one. They were all .Christians ! pious, learned, orthodox confessors. Arts and sciences revived, joy diffused itself over every honest countenance, and gloomy dejected looks confined themselves to their proper district, the faces of rogues and .villains: who returned to their lurking holes, from whence, like snakes and vipers in a time of contagiou, when the whole mass of air is as infected as their nests, they had crawled .abroad.

“ What can be more pleasant than to behold the triumphs of oppressed honesty, over pros* perous villainy ? What more ravishing, than to hear every muse sweetly celehrating the victory ? Now learned judges were placed upon the bench who never enquired what the plaintiff or defendant .was, but what was his cause; the pulpits were rescued from nonsense and blasphemy, and filled with learned and sober divines, and it was no crime to be learned and innocent.

“ St, Augustine being asked what he would wish to have seen, of alT that that had been be-

held by mortal man ? replied Christ in the flesh, Paul in the pulpit, and Rome in its glory. Next to this wish, which is uot to be equalled in any proportion, I would desire tQ see the Restoration. It is impossible to have a notion of the pleasure, of observing the countenances of the people, when they look, with a mingled aspect of shame and joy, upon him they had so long injured; or, of observing that kind forgiveness, that benignity, that complacency in the countenance of the Prince, upon seeing his servants returning to their duty without actually beholding it.

“ Upon the Restoration, preaching, history, poetry, philosophy, eloquence, &c. were carried to higher pitches than they arrived to, in apy age since the Auvustan. There was a universal change, from all that was wicked and detestable, to all that was good and desirable. This change was effected ip a most miraculous manner, with very little human interposition:they who wished well to it, were kept back from assisting the promotion of it, that the hand of God might appear more visibly in it: they who wished ill to it were restrained from obstructing its advancement. For such great, such conspicuous mercies! Let us offer up to God on the approaching festival, the sweet smelling sacrifice of unfeigned praise and thanksgiving.

“ But I may be asked, is this a time for joy, when we labour under such irretrievable calamities ? Shall we return thanks for a deliverance . from rogues with swords in their hands, when we are ruined by footmen, pimps, pathicks, parasites, bawds, whores, nay, what is more vexatious, old ugly whores ! such as could not find entertainment in the most hospitable hundreds of old Drury? The Psalmist complains of their insultings who called upon them to sing the sweet .songs of Sion in their Babylonish captivity. If he could not sing, who was enslaved by a* great and potent people, it is barbarous to invite us to chaunt lays of praise, who are become a prey to rascally peddling Jews, to petty brokers, to the scum, the’ off-scowering of foreign nations, and the dregs of our own. No, no, let us bumble ourselves in sack cloth and ashes, and supplicate the Almighty to take away the >great cause of all these evils from among us.

“ To this I answer; have we not received good from the hand of the Lord, and shall we not also receive evil ? The surest way to drawr to us future mercies, is to be grateful for those we have already received; the ungrateful sinner therefore, is a greater foe to his country than a South Sea Director.

“ Atheism, rebellion, adultery and murder, with every other vice, have had their impious advocates, except ingratitude. None have been so whimsically wicked, so impudently abandoned, as to stand up in defence of this vice. What is therefore so universally condemned, must be superlatively odious. The greatest benefits are received from Ged, who heaps them upon us without our least deserving.

807] t>ARL. HISTORY, 7 George I.

God is slow to punish, and ready to forgive: All the ‘ good we receive flows from him, the inexhaustible foundation of all goodness. The evils we endure, are the natural consequences of our own faults and follies; that he permits them to fall upon us is, that they may awaken us from our dream of vice. If we examine into the birth of our present misfortunes, we shall quickly find, they take their rise from ourselves. Whilst the world is wicked, it must be miserable; such is the order of things, that effects will follow their causes, unless the regular course of nature could be inverted.

“ The very chastisement of God are mercies, for which we are in duty bound to praise him:if his judgments then are to be praised, how much more his benefits ! Let every man among us return undissembled thanks to the Almighty -for the good things he has bestowed upon us. and our fathers ‘ and he may then confidently say, when he beholds our present calamities, in the words of holy David:The Lord, who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear ', he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.

u I once more beg a place in your Paper, to add something, by way of supplement, to a most popular pamphlet-called Cataline, or the Case Of the Conspirators. This author has said little of Marcus Crassus, who has been always in my judgment the worst of that accursed gang; though I have formed my notions of this man from a thousand little, mean, infamous, ungrateful actions his history is dwelled with.

I apprehend, 1 need only to select one instance out of them, to draw those who are unacquainted with history into my opinion.

“ Those who have read Cataline must remember into what wretched circumstances those detestable traitors ha'd brought the people. Marcus Crassus his son in law, his manumitted slaves, and other dependants, being the principal agents in the hellish conspiracy; we must not imagine Crassus, whose darling passion was money, would be without a large share of the plunder, consequent upon the treason of his followers.

u When the senate was labouring to close the gaping wounds of the public, the city was alarmed at a cause brought into the forum, by several builders, against the wealthy Crassus. The city had built a palace for Crassus, upon a tiiumph he obtained, which cost as many Roman talents, as amount to 300,0001. of our money. Crassus had for several years after the erecting of his palace been adorning it, which brought on a charge of 70,000l. more. Some of the workmen he employed sued him for their wages; the praetors gave sentence against Crassus, who from them appealed to the senate, affirming, that whatever expence he Could lavishly throw away upon his palace, by virtue of a decree of the senate, it was to be answered out of the public coffers.

1721. — The said labels, [S0$

u Cruel and barbarous Crassus! who, whilst he had five millions lodged among the Venett, the Belgae, the Ligurians, every penny of which, was the spoil, the plunder, or the gift of the public; was so inhuman as to demand the payment of his debts out of the treasury, then not so full as his own private.purse: at a time, when the cries of poverty were universal, when Crassus was in a habit of body incapable of relishing any one pleasure of life, and when he bad no son to inherit his ill acquired pelf.

“ It is to me a wonder that the senate did not use him as they did Q. Annius. It is however a piece of justice to continue the infamy of traitors through all ages, please to publish this letter, and thousands' will know that Marcus Crassus, the wealthiest of the Roman; Senators, was a mean spirited, abandoned villain, who never heard of him beforfe.

The said Libels censured, and Mist committed to Ncugale.] After the reading of these Libels, sir Joseph Jekyll, sir David Dalrymple, Mr. Yonge, colon’el Bladen, Mr. Puheney, the Attorney General, serjeant Pengelly, sir Wm. Thompson, Mr. Sloper, Mr. Iltingerford, and some others, animadverted, with indignation, upon the vile, scandalous, and false insinuations contained m them; and thereupon the House unanimously resolved, u That the paper intitled The Weekly" Journal, or Saturday’ *

* mestic, Saturday, May 27, 1721/ is a false, malicious, scandalous, infamous, and traitorous Libel, tending to allieoate the affections of his majesty’s subjects, atod to excite the-people to sedition and rebellion, ' with an intention to subvert the present happy establishment, and to introduce popery and arbitrary power.”

And it was ordered, “ That N. Mist, the printer and publisher of the said paper, be for his said offence, committed a prisoner to his majesty’s gaol of Newgate:and that Mr. Speaker do issue his'warrants accordingly.”

It was also resolved, nem. con. That aa humble Address be presented to his majestj, expressing the Commons’ utmost abhorrence of the scandalous, infamous and traitorous Libel (intitled The Weekly Journal, or Saturday’s 4 Post, with freshest advices, foreign and do *

809] PARL. HISTORY; 7 George I. 1721. — committed to Newgate, ' [8101

to find out and discover the' authors of such wicked, seditious and traitorous Libels.”

After this a Committee was appointed to enquire into the authors, contrivers, printers and publishers! of the said seditious and traitorous Libel; and of all other seditious. Libels, which tend to raise discontent and disaffection in the minds of his majesty’s subjects; and that they have power to send for persons, papers and records. It was also ordered, That the said printed paper, mtitled The Weekly

* Journal, or Saturday’s Post, with freshest

* advices* foreign and domestic, May 27, 1721/ be referred to the said Committee.

May 31. Mr. Comptroller reported the king’s Answer to the Address of the Hpuse against Mist’s and other Libels, which was to this effect, viz. “ That his majesty thanked this House for their most dutiful and loyal Address, and would immediately give the necessary orders for prosecuting and punishing the authors, printers, and publishers of all scandalous and seditious libels.”

1 In the mean time, endeavours were used to / prevent Mist’s being committed to Newgate:to which purpose, that very day, a Petition of David Crawford, esq. marshal of the prison of the court of King’s Bench; was presented to the House and read, setting forth, That Mr. Mist (printer of the Weekly Journal) was in his custody, in execution upon a Judgment, givea against him by the said court; and that he bad been also charged in his custody with an action of debt for 500/.; and that he having notice of the Order of this House, for committing the said Mr. Mist, to his majesty’s gaol of Newgate, was ready to pay all due obedience to this House; but that Mr. Mist being a Prisoner in execution and for debt, the petitioner humbly prayed, That lie might be indemoified in such maimer, as to this House should seem meet.

vlle/eupon it was ordered, “ That the said N. Mist, the printer of the said seditious and traiterous libel, do stand committed close prisoner to the said prison of the court of King’s Bench during the pleasure of this House, as also, That it be referred to the Committee appointed to enquire into the authors, contrivers, printers and publishers of all seditious and traitorous libels, which tend to raise discontent and disaffection in the minds of his majesty’s subjects, to examine precedents, in what manner persons who are prisoners in execution have been examined before this House, or anyCom-mittee thereof, and to report the same to the House with all convenient speed.”

June 3. The lord Hinchinbrooke reported from the Committee, appointed to enquire into the authors, contrivers, and publishers of the above seditious and traiterpus libel, &c. That the Committee had searched, and found several precedents of persons who, being in execution, bad, nevertheless, been brought to the bar of the House of Commons; and his lordship delivered in the said, report at the table. The said Report was read; and then Mr. Speaker

acquainted the House, That an intimation, had been left at his house that morning in writing, that Mr. Mist was to have his liberty that night by the consent of the marshal of the prison of the court of King’s-Bench, in order for his going to France; and that the said Mist’s wife was moving her goods. And the House was also informed, That the said Committee, in the Course of their examination, had likewise intimation, that it was apprehended that the said Mist would endeavour to escape, and that his wife was disposing of his goods. And the House being informed that the marshal of the prison of the court of the King’s Bench was above in the Speaker’s chamber, he was called down, and at. the bar examined touching the manner in which the said Mist was confined. And he acquainted the House, That the said Mist was kept in one Mulling’* house, being the next house to, the King’s Bench prison, and where he usually keeps the king’s prisoners: and that he was there under locks in the day time, and two keepers attending in the night: and then he withdrew. Hereupon it was ordered, “ That Mr. Speaker do issue his warrants to the Serjeant at Arms, attending this House, and alsd to the marshal of the prison of the court of King’s Bench, to bring the said N. Mist to the bar of this House immediately.”

Accordingly Mist was brought in to the bar of the House, by the serjeant at arms; and pertinaciously refusing to be examined, under pretence that he understood there was a prosecution intended against him, he was directed . by Mr. Speaker to withdraw; and it was ordered, “ 1. That the said N.Mist be committed prisoner to Newgate, there to be kept in close custody during the pleasure of the House;

2. That the said Mr. Mist be not admitted the use of pen, ink, or paper, and that no person be admitted to come to the said Mist, without \ the leave of the House. 3. That Mr. Speaker do isssue his warrants accordingly; 4. That the keeper of Newgate prison, do bring the said

N. Mist to the said Committee, appointed to inquire into the authdrs, printers, and publishers of seditious and traiterous libels, from time to time, when he shall be required so to do by the said Committee; and 5. That the said Committee be empowered to examine any person, they shall think fit, in the most solemn manner.” >.

A few days after, N. Mist was brought before the said Committee, and being examined about the author of his Journal, gave unsatisfactory auswers. On the other hand, some bold expresssiofis and insinuations in Cato’s Letters, published in the London Journal^ having given no small offence to some men in power, the same Committee thought fit to send for I. Peele, the publisher of that paper, who thereupon absconded. Hereupon the Committee sent for Mr. Gordon, the reputed author of Cato’s Letters, who being indisposed thought proper likewise to keep out of tl^e way.

Sixth Report of the Committee of Secrecy oh the Proceedings of the Sooth Sea Company.] June 5. Mr. Clayton reported, from the Committee of Secrecy, some timber matters as they appeared to the said Committee; and which they had directed him to report to the House; and he read the Report in his place, as follows:

Sixth Report of the Committee of Secrecy on the Proceedings of the Sooth Sea Company.

That the Committee of Secrecy* appointed to inquire itoto all the proceedings relating to the execution of an act, passed the last session of parliament, intituled, “ An Act for enabling the South Sea Company to increase their present capital stock, and fund, by redeeming such public debts and incumbrances, as are therein mentioned; and for raising money, to be applied for lessening several of the public debts and incumbrances; and for calling in the present exchequer bills remaining uncancelled; and for making forth new bills, in lieu thereof, to be circulated and exchanged, upop demand, at or near the Exchequer; ” observing the instruction given them by the House,

That they should proceed in the farther examination of the particulars of the 574, 500/. South Sea Stock, supposed to be disposed of between the 4th of February 1719, and the 12th of April following; they have accordingly proceeded therein.

And your Committee examined, in the most solemn manner, William Compere, one of the persons mentioned in the account of the said 574, 500/. stock:and he declares, That he did not buy the quantities of stock, in the said account charged to be sold to him, neither oi the South Sea Company, Mr. Knight, Mr. Surman, or any other person concerned for the Company, to his knowledge; nor had he any such stock taken in, or held, for him, by any of the persons aforesaid.

And the several other brokers, and persons, mentioned in the Appendix, Letter A, who are also inserted in the said account, as buyers of other parts of the .said stock, having been examined by your committee, have, in like manner, denied their buying such stock, or having the same taken in, or held for them; and have declared, that their names ar ^, in the said account, made use of without their knowledge or consent: and your Committee observe, That the several sums mentioned in the said Appendix A, amount to 339, 500/. South Sea Stock.

And from hence it is evident, that the names of the said persons have been fictitiously made use of, iu order to conceal the persons for whose benefit such stock was really disposed of.

Mr. Carbonnel, a broker, in the said account mentioned; is in Holland, as your Committee is informed, and they have had no opportunity

of examining him, or the other persons mentioned in the Appendix, letter 13, hereunto annexed; and the said stock charged as sold to them, amounts to 32,000l.

As to the Lords of Parliament, and members of this House, named in ths said account of stock sold, which account of stock amounts in the whole to 124,000l. the particulars of which are mentioned in the AppendixKC; your Committee lay before the House all the examinations by them taken relating thereto, in the words of the examination themselves.

Mr. Roiert Surman being examined, and

shewed the said accounts of stock sold, as to the. several articles of 30,000l. and 2,000l. stock to lord Chetwynd, of the 15th and l/tb February, 1719, at the rates of 179 and 182/. per cent, says, that when he was (by Mr. Knight’s direction) preparing the said account of stock sold, to be laid before the House, Mr, Knight read those sums to him out of the green book; (mentioned in his formfer examination) wherein this examinant at (he same time saw the lord Chetwynd’s name, at the heap of an account therein kept between his lordihip and Mr. Knight; and the examinaot verily believes, that his lordship’s name and the aforesaid sums, and all other names and sums which were read out of the said green book, are real, . and that such persons bad such stock actually held for them; and that these two sums were really held by Mr. Knight for lord Chetwynd’s benefit, who had the power over so much stock, and had a right at any time to demand the difference, in case of a rise; and the examinant never heard that hi* lordship either paid any money or gave security for paying for the said .stock.

were all read to this examinant by Mr. Knight, out of the said green book, and are of the same nature; and touching these sums, he says the same as he has said concerning the first mentioned sums of 30,000l. and 2,000l. charged to be sold to the lord Chetwynd.

As to the article of the 15th of February, 1719, of 4,000l. stock, and charged to be sold tolieut. gen. Pepper, at 180/. per cent., This examinant says, it is of the same nature as the first mentioned sums; and farther, this examinant believes that gen. Pepper had such stock taken in for him by Mr. Knight.

Mr. Knight some time after the said 15th of February, told the examinant, that he had sold it for the general, who was angry at his selling of it so soon, *stock soon after rising higher; and the examinant believes, if there was any difference, the same was paid or accounted for by Mr. Knight to gen. Pepper.

As to the article of 4,000l. at 276/. per cent, and 3,000l. at 300/. per cent of the 23rd and 25th of March, charged to sir William Gordon, the examinant says, they are of the •ame nature as the first mentioned sums; and farther, that he had several times seen sir William Gordon with Mr. Knight, and verily believes the account of the said sums were adjusted between them.

As to the article of the 15th of February, of 20,000l. to lord Gower, he says, That that was a transaction of Mr. Gibbon’s, who brought to Mr. Knight a paper, containing the names of persons to whom he had disposed of the Company’s stock, saying, ‘ Here is the ac- count of the stock which I have disposed of/ That he believes the following names and sums,

, £

Ld. Gower for the said 20,000 at 180 Feb. 15. Lord Lansdown for - 5,000 at 180 Mar. 1. His lordship more - - 5,000 at 176| ditto, were contained in the paper of Mr. Gibbon, find from that paper were entered b^ the examinant in the said account of the stock sold, that he does not know these names were in the green book, but believes an account was kept between Mr. Gibbon and Mr. Knight in the said green hook, the examinant having seen M^r. Gibbon's name in that book, at the head of an account, and believes that these sums were held or taken in for the use of the said lord Gower and lord Lansdown.

That the following entries in the account of stock sold, viz.

1.000 to sir Cop. Bampfield, at 275 per cent.

, March 22.

1.000 to Mr. J. Bampfield, at the same price

and time.

1.000 to sir John Bland, at the same.

1.000 to sir Thomas Seabright, at the same.

1,000. to Henry Bracks, esq. at 260/. same day.

1.000 to Charles Longueville, esq. at 325/.

March 25.

1.000 to sir William Carew, at 800/. Mar. 81. were all brought by Mr. Chester to Mr,

Knight, in a paper containing an account of the stock disposed of by him, in the same manner, as Mr. Gibbon brought his particular sums, and from that paper the examinant, by Mr. Knight’s direction, entered these sums in the> account of stock sold.

That in discourse with Mr. Knight since this enquiry began, Mr. Knight has often expressed . a' great deal of uneasiness on account of stock sold and bought for the Company, saying, he had in these affairs obliged several persons, whom he did not care to name.

Your Committee, at the request of the said Mr. Forrester, examined Mr. John Mark, banker, and as to the article of the 23rd of March, 1719, of 1,000l. South Sea stock charged to be sold to the said Mr. Forrester at 272/. per cent, he says, he did about this time boy at market for Mr. Forrester, 2,000Z. or 3,000l. South Sea stock, at ov about that price, and that Mr. Forrester being disappointed of money to pay for 1,000l. of it (sir Lambert Blackwell, who had bought an annuity of 100/. of him, not paying for it, because of an objection to the title) Mr. Forrester applied to the examinant to lend him money upon the 1,000l. stock, for two or three days, which the examinant not being able to do, he desired him ta get it for him of a friend; upon which the examinant applied to sir Lambert Blackwell, and he told him. he would ask -Mr. Knight to do it, which Mr. Knight, by sir Lambert’s desire, accordingly did, upon the examinant’s engaging to pay him the money in a few days, and the examinant named Mf, Forrester to sir Lambert Blackwell.

The examinant afterwards told Mr. Forrester, he had got the stock taken in for him for a few days, but did not tell him by whom; that in a short time afterwards, Mr. Forrester paid the examinant the. principal and interest, and the examinant paid Mr. Knight.

Mr. Mark, in a subsequent examination, ' say8, that, to the best of this examinant’s remembrance, the 1,000l. stock mentioned in his former examination, was by Mr. Forrester’s direction, transferred to Mr. Sambrooke by this examinant, before this examinant paid Mr. Knight the money mentioned in hi9said former examination.

Sir Lambert Blackwell being likewise examined, at Mr. Forrester’s request, says, that about February or March, 1719, Mr. Mark told the examinant, that he had bought 1,000l. stock for Mr. Forrester, and that Mr. Forrester wanted money for a few days to pay for it} Mr. Mark desired the examinant to speak to Mr. Knight to advance the money, (which the examinant accordingly did; and the examinant afterwards told Mr. Mark, that Mr. Knight did advance the money) upon his agreeing to repay it; and that he, Mr. Mark, repaid it with interest, very soon after it was so borrowed. *

Mr. John Edwin being also examined, at the desire of, Mr. Forrester, says, he never’heard of the said 1,000l. till the account of

€15] PARK. HISTORY, 7 George I. 1721.- — Sixth Report the Proceedings [816

stock sold was laid before the House: That since that time he met Mr. Forrester at a tavern, who seemed to be much, surprised at the charge of ’1,000l. stock to him, and declared, that he knew nothing of it; and be gave the examinant, and the rest of the company there, such a relation of the matter, as induced them to believe he was clear of the affair, but the particulars of this relation this examinant cannot remember.

As to the article of 2,000l. stock charged to sir Montague Blundell (now lord Blundell) your Committee, at his lordship’s request, examined William Chetwynd, esq. Charles Col-bourne, and Mr. Robert Surman. Mr. Chetwynd says, that on or about the 28th day of March, 1720, the said lord Blundell desired this examinant to transfer 500/. South Sea stock, which the examinant had in trust for lord Blundell, to Mr. Knight, as an additional security for 1,000l. stock taken in by him for lord Blundell, at 316/. per cent, amounting to 3, 160/. which the examinant #accordingly did.

That the examinant thinking the said 500/. stock, together with the said 1,000l. stock, more than'a sufficient security for the said 3, 160/. did apply to Mr. Knight, to take in 1,000l. stock for him (the examinant) upon the said 5,000l., of additional security, at 320/. per cent, or thereabouts, which Mr. Knight complied with, at the sole request and desire of the examinant.

That neither this examinant nor lord Blundell, have received any manner of profit or advantage by either of the said 1,000l. stock; for the said 2,000l. now remains in the hands of Mr. Knight, or his agents; together with the 500/. stock additional security, which they in all probability must lose in this affair.

The said 2,000l. stock are distinct accounts; for this examinant did transfer to the said lord BlutideU’s use, 256/. stock, being his share of the additional security aforesaid; and this examinant did believe, when this matter was transacted, that it was an account with Mr. Knight only, wherein the Company was no wavs concerned.

The said Charles Colebourne being examined, says, he did on or about the 26th of March 1720, buy 1,000l. South-Sea stock by the direction of Mr. Thomas Holdip, and Mr. Wil-liam-Chetwynd, or one of them, but for the account of the said lord Blundell, at the rate of 316/. per cent, which stock was paid for by Mr. Surman, by order of Mr. Knight, on or about the 28th day of the said March 1720, and at the same time 500/. more stock was transferred by the said Mr. Chetwynd to the said Surman, which (as the said Chetwynd then informed this examinant) was so transferred, for, and as a farther security for the repayment of 3, 160/. thfen paid for the said 1,000l. stock, at the said rate of 316/. per cent, with interest lor the same.

The said Surma* being examined says, there

was 2,000l. stock charged to lord Blundell,

4

read to the exatqinant out of the green book, as he has said in a former examination.

That about the 26th of March, 1720, William Chetwynd, brother-in-law to lord Blundell, transferred 500/. stock to this examinant, which he understood was an additional security for stock taken in by Mr. Knight; that after the enquiry began in parliament about the South-Sea affairs, Mr. Chetwynd came to the examinant to know how that 500/. was applied; and the examinant told him that it still remained dUe from him to Mr. Chetwynd, and at that time1 Mr. Chetwynd told him, the examinant, it was a. security taken in by Mr. Knight, for lord Blundell and himself; and this examinant believes lord Blundell was then with Mr. Chetwynd, by reason the examinant^ through the hurryj of business, had neglected, to take directions from Mr. Knight how to apply it.

The said Mr. Robert Surman being at the request of Thomas Wynn, esq. farther examined by your Committee, as to the said stock, said to be sold by him, says, he can say no more concerning that matter than he has said in his former examination.-

Sir John Blunt being examined the 26 th of

January, 1720, says, he - was privy to the selling of stock for the Company; that he did himself dispose of 6,000l. part of the Company’s said stock, to col. Monroe, a member of parliament, at 275/. per cent, that to the best of the examinant’s remembrance, col. Monroe desired some stock to be taken in for him, (that is, to have the money advanced for him for so much stock) that he sent one Lopez a broker, to him, to take it in; but this examinant had leave from some of the governors and directors, to let Mr. Monroe have so much of the Company’s stock; and upon that, this examinant told the broker, he would take it in for him, and sell it himself, that there was no stock transferred, but this examinant gave Mr. Knight an account of so much of the Company’s stock sold to Mr. Monroe; that in April last (to the best of his remembrance) col. Mouroe, or his brother, desired his stock might be sold, and upon that, this examinant referred him to Mr. Knight to deliver it; that he does not know that col. Monroe gave any security to the Company to answer the 275/. per cent, other than the said agreement made be* tween this examinant and the said broker.

That he also disposed of 1,000l. other part of the Company’s said stock, to Jos. Banks, esq. (a member of this House) at 310/* per cent, who desired this examinant to sell him so much stock at the market price, and t« take his note, payable in a month or six weeks, for the money, which lie accordingly did, which was paid about May following, at which time, the stock was advanced in value; and this exa- minant paid that money to Mr. Knight for the company’s use, soon after he refceived it.

Blunt gave Mr. Banks a note to transfer the quantity of stock, and took Mr. Banks’s note for the money:Some dine after these notes were given, and after the money paid, Mr. Banks dired to borrow 4,000 /.(as he believes) 0« this stock; and he believes Mr. Knight took this examinant’s note as so much stock: that he believes Mr. Knight Jeot him 4,000l. accordingly, in June last; that be had no view 'towards the facilitating the bill in the disposal of this stock, the said Mr. Monroe and Mr. Banks being inclined to pass the bill, before the stock was disposed of to them (as they, bad declared to him.) Your committee, at the desire of the said col. Monroe, examined Gabriel Lopez, a broker, as to the said 6,000l. stock charged to be sold to col.. Monroe; and he Says, that about the middle of March 1719-20, the said col. Monroe sent for him to Gar raw ay’s coffeehouse, and gave him a letter directed to sir John Blunt, in which (to the best of the epaminant’s remembrance) col. Monroe desired-him to take in. for him 6,000l. South-Sea stock at interest, and that he would repay him again in a month. At the same time, col. Monroe ordered the examinant to buy for him the said sum ef 6,000l. South-Sea stock, which the examinant did at the same time, of sir John Blunt, at 9T&L per cent* which was 'the then market price: and sir John Blunt did at the same lime, agree to place the said sum of 6,000l. South-Sea stock, tp col. Monroe’s account:and says, that within a month afterwards, col. Monroe ordered him to sell the same 6,000l. Soutb-Sea stock again; which be accordingly did, to Mr. Patterson, at cent. And Mr. Patterson and Mr. Surman, by Order of sir John Bluut, did adjust the said stock with col. Monroe, who did (to the best of lps remembrance) pay about 80/. for interest, and sir John Blunt gave the examinant commission for selling the said stock.

. The said Thomas Patterson beiag hereupon examined by yonr Committee, at the.desire of the said colonel Monroe, he says, that at the latter end of March, 1719-20, colonel Monroe . desired the examinant to lay out some money for him in South Sea Stock:upon which the examinant gave the colonel'a letter of credit on Mr* Lopez, (who transacted nao tly the examinant’s business) to act for the said colonel Monroe, to the value of 20,000l. In a day or two after (the examinant say*) the col»nel in-treated him to take in 6,000l. South Sea stock

for a month, which stock he would purchase; the examinant being much out of cash, which prevented his complying, he went with the colonel to tl»q Sword Blade Company, and proffered himself as a farther security to sir George Caswall, if he would take in the said stock. Sir George acquainted them, he had disposed of all the money he could spare, and the then examinant came frqm the Sword Blade office, with (he colonel to Garraway’s coffeehouse; sir John Blum! being in the coffee-room; the examinant said to the.colonel, you are acquainted with sir John Blunt, ha is a monied man, Vol, VII.

ask him to lend the money on 6,000l. South Sea stock, and tell him, I will be a farther so* . curity for seeing the money repaid. Upon this the colonel went to sir John Blunt, and in a little-time after the examinant went to them, and told sir John Blunt he would be bound for any money he should lead the colonel on stock, which sir John Blunt did not object to, and from that time the examinant thought himself bound to see the money repaid, which sir John Blunt should lend the colonel on stock; and in a few days after, the colonel acquainted tha examinant, that Lopez had bought for him

6, 00 01.South Sea stock, at 267 per cent, and that sir John Blunt had lent the money, aod desired the examinant to be ready to answer the difference if any should happen; the examinant told the colonel he was ready when sir John Blunt should demand it. That in the beginning of April, sir John Blunt at the South Sea house, told the examinant he should want his money before the 1st of May, 1720, and thereupon the examinant assured him he might depend, on its being repaid, for he would sell the stock and see it performed. Accordingly the examinant sold the stock in April, and sir John Blunt sent the examinant’s broker to Sun-man to deliver the stock. He says the money with interest was repaid Surman, on the delivery of the stock, and that he did not know sir John Blunt sold the stock, or that it was the Company’s, till January last, for the transaction appeared to the examinant as if it had been upon sir John’s own account.

Your Committee having received a letter frqm Mr. Banks, desiring that sir John Blunt might be. farther examined as to the said 1,000l. stock: yonr Committee accordingly again examined him, and he says, that be never did tell Mr. Banks that this was the Company’s stock till ahout Christmas last, and be believes till that time Mr. Banks did not know that it was so: that about Christmas last, after this enquiry began, the examinant went to Mr. Banks, and told him, this 1,000l. was the Conw pane’s stock :'’at which Mr.'Banks was very much surprized, but said that it signified nothing to him, or to that effect: the examinant says, he also (by the direction of Mr. Knight) offered to leave Mr. Banks’s name out of the list, which Mr. Banks refused, saying, as he had bought it, and honestly paid for it, and more than be could afterwards haxe bought it for, he would not- have his name cancelled, or to that effect: that Mr. Banks also, a day or two afterwards, wrote the examinant a letter to this purpose, which letter be has at present mislaid.

Your Committee likewise, at Mr. Banks’s request, examined Mr. Joseph Banks, jnn. his son:who says that he was not present either when his father Joseph Banks, esq. bought the said 1,000l. South Sea stock of sir John Blunt, or paid him 9, 100/. for k, on the 6th of May 1720, bilt was informed thereofby his father, who talked of it publiely, not as a favour done him, nor u thing to be concealed, hat as

an accidental bargain, and often said, he could have bought it soon afterwards near 500/. cheaper in Exchange alley.

. That about the 9th or 10th of June, when stock was 750/. per cent, and the South Sea Company were making a loan of400/. per cent, on their stock, the examinant desired his father either to borrow or let him borrow 4,000l. on that stock; which be consented to, but told the examinant, that sir John Blunt (to save the charge of a transfer and being in a burry) had only given him a note for transferring the said stock, and then gave the examinant the said note, of which he kept a copy, and the same is in the Allowing words:

. ‘ May 6th, 1720.

. I promise to transfer to Joseph Banks,

* esq. or order, 1,000l. South Sea Stock, value

* received. John Blunt/ I

Which note the examinant, on the 10th of June, carried to the South-Sea House, and enquired for sir John Blunt; and after some time round out the room at the bottom of the great > stairs, where he was with several other gentlemen, and was called in, and shewing him the note, told him, that he was come to have the said 1,000l. stock transferred to Mr. Banks, which sir John Blunt said he would do immediately; but there being then a great crowd, he desired the examinant to stay a quarter of an hour! which the examinant accordingly did, but the crowd still continuing, sir John Blunt refused to go; at which the examinant being angry, and not willing to wait any longer, sir John said, he would desire Mr. Knight to do it for him, and that be would transfer the like sum to Mr. Knight another time; which the examinant consented to, and gave him up his said note, taking of him at the same time another note in the following words.

* June 10th, 1720.

* I promise to transfer to Robert Knight,

* esq. or order, 1,000l. South-Sea stock, value

€Banks, esq. ♦John Blunt. ’

Which note the examinant immediately conveyed to Mr. Knight, in a room up stairs, at the South-Sea House; and having acquainted him with the matter, gave him sir John Blunt's last mentioned note, upon which he made an entry in a book, which the examinant says, he thought was transferring it, but the examinant did not sign any thing, but received from Mr. Knight 4,000l. for his father's use, as a loan , upon the said stock; which Mr. Knight very readily paid him without taking any note or security for it, from the examinant, .save the delivering up sir John Blunt’s note as aforesaid.

That there was not one word passed from sir John Blunt to Mr. Knight, as if that stock hs^d been the Company’s stock, nor did1 the examinant think, or in the least suspect it to be so; that the said 4,000l. is not yet repaid, but remains due upon the said stock, for ought he knows.

Your Committee, at the request of col. Scott, examined Charles Asgill; who savs, that on or about the 1st day of April, 1720, he did, by order of Mr. Thomas Patterson, buy of Matthew Weymondsold, 1,000l. South-Sea stock, at 509/. per cent, to be paid for on the 4th of the same month; that applying to Mr. Patter-’ son for the money, to pay for the same, he ordered this examinant to go to Mr. Knight, in the name of col. Joints Scott, to borrow it; that the examinant accordingly went, but Mr. Knight would lend no more than 2, 500/. on thfe said 1,000l. stock, being after the rate of 250/. per cent, of which this examinant acquainted Mr. Patterson; who approving thereof, gave this examinant 590/. to reduce the said 1,000l. stock from 309, to 250/. per cent, which being done, the said 1,000l. stock was, on the said 4th of April, 1720, transferred by Mr. Surman, by Mr. Knight’s order, at 250/. per cent.; that tni3 whole affair was transacted by the direction of Mr. Patterson, and the examinant did not know col. Scott till a considerable time after.

The said Mr. Asgill being plso examined, at the request of col. Montgomery, as to the said 2,000l. stock charged to be sold- to him; ' says, ' that on or about the 29th of March, 1720, this examinant, by the order of Mr. Thomas Patterson, .went to Mr. Robert Knight, in the name of col. Montgomery, to borrow money on 2,000l. South-Sea stock, which Mr. Knight complied with; but said, he would lend no more than 5,000l. on 2,000l. stock, being at tho rate of 250/. per cent, unless 500/. stock more waf transferred to him, or his order, as a farther security, and then he would lend 6, 300/. being' 'after the rate of 315/. per cent, the then’ market price; but told this examinant, that if the gentleman had not bought the said 2,000l.’ stock, not to let him buy it, for that he (Mr; Knight) would sell it'him, rather than puzzlo his accounts with transfers, and being at the trouble of raising the money; of which this' examinant acquainted Mi1. Patterson, who approving thereof, ordered the examinant to buy the said 2,000l. stock of Mr. Knighr, which he did accordingly at 315/. per cent, and Mr. Knight agreed to continue the said 2,000l. stock in his own name, on condition that the said 500/. stock was transferred, as a farther security for the taking of the said 2,000l. stock, and payndent of the said 6, 300/. being 315/, ' per cent, agreed to be paid as aforesaid with interest, which 500/. additional stock was accordingly transferred to Mr. Surman by Mr, Knight’s order, on the same day, or the day following? That this whole affair was transacted by Mr. Patterson’s direction, and that he did not know col. Montgomery till a month after, or longer.

. Your Committee examining the said Patter-sou, at the request of the said col. Scott, and cob Montgomery, he says, that about the latter end of March 1719, col. John Montgomery and col. James Scott, desired the examinant to buy some South-Sea stock for their use, and

upon theif account, which the examinant Contented to; and. thereupon sent for Mr* Asgill a broker, and gave him directions to buy 3,000l. South-Sea stock, viz. 2,000l. for col. Montgomery, and 1,000l. foe col. Scott, and told Asgill he would give any security that should be demanded by any person, who would take in the said 3,000l. stock. Asgill then said to the examinaht, he would go and .propose it to Mr. Knight; and Asgill returned to the examinhnt in half an hour, and acquainted the examinant, Mr. Knight would take in 2,000l. stock for col. Montgomery, if 500/. more stock was transferred to him for securing the same: And that Mr. Knight would lend 2, 500/. money on 1,000l. Stock for col. James Scott, both which the examinant approved of, and ordered Asgill to buy the .1,000l. stock for col- James Scott, and gave him money to reduce the stock to 250/. per cent, and the examinant transferred the 500/. stock ta Mr. Knight for col. Montgomery.

Sir John Blunt being examined, and asked whether he did not know, or believe that the said 574, 500/. stock, or any part thereof, was disposed of to facilitate the passing of the bill in parliament ? He says, that the first parcel (to the best of his remembrance) of the said stock which was disposed of (as this examinant was informed by Mr. Gibbon, one of the directors) was about the sum of 20,000l. or 30, 00<X. sold or disposed of by the said Gibbon (to the best of his remembrance) that the intention thereof was for the service of, and to make more friends for the Company, and he does not know at what price: That he does not know whether any money was, or was not paid to the Company for the said stock, nor does he know any thing more relating to the said transaction.

Your committee examining the said Mr. Gibbon, as to the account of slock entered in the cash-book to be sold, he says, lie never saw any account of it, but what is in the book, until a paper drawn up by Mr. Knight was shewn hiip, after the order of the House of Commons, and he looked upon it but cursorily.

He says, that about the latter end of February last, Mr. Knight said to him, it would be for the Company's advantage to sell some stock, it being then at a good price, between 170 and 180/. per cent, and if the bill did not pass, it would be well sold, and if it did pass, the rest would sell at a better price; that he does not know that the Company had then stock to dispose of.

That Mr. Knight said, he was to take upon himself the transacting that stock, and the persons to whom it was to be delivered were to be accountable for the price; but that he was to transact this on behalf of the Company; and that the persons who were to haye it, might either have it transferred to them, or take the difference.

He does not know of any stock disposed of to any member of either House of parliament, except what is mentioned to be done by him, in the account delivered in to the House; and does not remember any one else desired stock.

1721. — of the South Sea [$9#

He believes that Mr. Knight told him, that Mr. Holditch and Mr. Hawes disposed of stock to members of the House of Commons, who are not named in the account delivered in to the House.

As to the 20,000l. charged in the account to lord Gower, he says that lord Gower sent to him about the latter end of February last, tO help him to buy 20,000l. stock, which this ex* aminant said he would try to do, and believed he could do it; that the same day* or the next day, this examinant spoke to Mr. Knight, and asked him to undertake to deliver this stock, at three months time, at 180/. per cent, which ho complied with; and this examinant took Mr. Knight’s note for so much stock accordingly; and it was understood that the stock was to be delivered three months after, it being not paid for before, with the<interest in the mean time:that he gave lord Gower his own note* for the delivery of this 9tock in three months, and took his lordship’s note to~accept it, and pay the money in three months time with interest; in the mean time, that there was 4,000l. South-Sea stock transferred to this examinant by a steward of the duke of Rutland, and lord Gower told the examinant, that the said 4,000l. should be transferred to him asf farther security, and that the duke of Rutland was concerned*in the bar-, gain; says, that the stock was accordingly transferred to him a few days afterwards; arid lord Gower told him, some part of the 20,000l. stock wa3 afterwards sold at about 300/. per cent. (as. he believes) and this exjaminant said, that Mr. Knight received the money, and kept the account of it, and believes that lord Gower did not know that Mr. Knight transacted it; and says, that this.examinant’s agreement with Mr. Knight for the delivery of this stock, was absolute in all events; when Mr. Knjght afterwards, upon making up. the account of stock sold, told this examinant that this 20,000/, was Company’s stock, and must be put down so; the examinant said, then he must give him his own name and the name of bird Gower, to whom it was disposed of; believes, that other part of this stock was sold at 350/. per cent, and the other part at 400/. per cent, apd that no part of the money was paid by lord Gower till after the first parcel of the stock was sold, which was much sooner than the time of payment, and the account was made up by Mr. Knight about the end of the three months.

As. to the two sums of 500/. stock each, changed in the.account to lord Lansdown, this examinant had a note from his lordship for acceptance and payment, and his lordship agreed to give security, but the price of stock rising, this examinant did not insist upon it.

He believes that both parcels of stock were 9old in about a month’s time, and that part of it was transferred to lord and lady Lansdown, aud-the account of it was made up, and the money to be paid atyowed with interest:that this examinant believes lord Lapsdown had no knowledge of this being the Company’s stock; , that he gave lord Lapsdown two notes for dc *

livery of the stock, and depended upon Mr. Knight for it; and believes Mr. Knight intend-. ed to charge the said lord Lausd own’s stock to the Company's account, if he could get it allowed, otherwise he was to answer it himself. And this examinant took a note from Mr. Knight to himself for delivery of the said tO,000l. stock, and also of the said two 500/. stock; and that lord Lansdown’s name was in-eerted in the account, in the same manner as lord Gower's.

. Mr. Chester being examined, says that the Stock he disposed of to members of parliament, they actually bought of him, and he believes knew not that such stock was the Company's. After such members bad bought the. stock of iriro, this examinant went to Mr, Knight* and bought so much stock of him, and ordered him to deliver it to those gentlemen, to whom he had so sold it; and after he had agreed with Mr. Knight, the examinant referred them to Mr. Knight, with whom he believes they transacted it.

tr. That the dates entered in the accounts of Stock arc not true, as be believes.

- That that the parsons to whom be sfld the stoat, were

Henry Bracks, esq. - - 1,000 at 260

Sir Copp. Bampfield - - 1,000 at 275

John Bampfield, esq. - 1,000 at 275

Sir John Bland - - - 1,000 at 275

Sir Thomas Seabright - 1,000 at 275

Charles Longueville, esq. 1,000 at 325

Sir William Carew, kot. 1,000 at 300 which two last, (by reason of the price) he believes, were after the bill passed.

That as to Mr. Dracks, the examinant says, there had been several years' dealing between him and Mr. Dracks, the examinant seldom ltceiving less than 4,000l. per ann. on Mr. Bracks' account, and there was a running account between them at the time of this transaction j that Mr. Dracks some time after the baying the stock for him, did pay the examinant 2, 600/. for it, and the examinant forthwith paid that sum to Mr. Knight, or Mr. Sur-raan, for the same.

As to sir Copp. Bampfield, Mr. Bampfield, sir John Blend, and sir Thomas Seabright, the examinant says, he had letters from them Tor the acceptance of such stock; and particularly from sir Copp. and Mr. Bampfield, and some time after stock being fallen SO or 40 per cent. Mr. Bampfield came to the examinant, and fold him that sir Copp. and himself were eeady to take the stock whenever he pleased ^, and about the same time sir William Carew made him the said offer.

Sir John Bland's stock was afterwards (as he believes) sold for himself by Mr. Knight.

That Mr. Longueville came to the-exami-ffant, and offered the money for his stock; and the examinant acquainted him, that he had transacted it'with Mr. Knight, and sent Ms. Longueville to him, and he paid the money to Mr. Knight (as the examinant verily believes).

The examinant says, be does not know that the stock so disposed of by him, was part of the fictitioos stock, said to be sold by the Company; but as to his belief be cannot answer; that at the tube be bought this stock of Mr. Knight, he really believed it .was Mr. Knight's own private stock, and did not know, nor had heard, that Mr. Knight sold or tram* acted any of the Company's stock at that time or before.

That when he wanted to buy stock, he sometimes bought it of Mr. Knight.

- That when be thus disposed of the aforesaid stock, he had a considerable quantity of hi# own stock, but he did not sell the said gentlemen his own stock, but bought it of Mr* Knight for them ns aforesaid: that h6 did not know that this was the Company^ stock, till about the time he saw the account of stock sold, prepared by Mr. Knight, to be laid before the House; and then Mr. Knight told him, that the stock which he had sold him was part of the stock sold by the Company.

Sir Robert Chaplin being examined as to the 1,000l. South-Sea stock sold to him and £d-ward Rolf, esq. by Mr. Knight in February, 1719, at 174£/. per cent, says the agreement with Mr. Knight for this stock was verbal, and neither the examinant nor Mr. Holt gave any note to pay for it; that neither he nor Mr. Rolt knew it was the Company's stock, bat thought it was bought with Mr. Knight's money; that Mr. Knight and be going into a coach together to Westminster, the examinant complained he had not money, upon which Mr. Knight offered to buy 5,000l. stock for him; that at Westminster Mr. Rolt made the same complaint of, want of money, and the examinant told him what had passed betweeu him and Mr. Knight; and then Mr. Rolt and the examinant agreed to have 10,000l. stock in partnership, Mr. Knight agreeing to get it for them:that Mr. Rolt and he afterwards agreed, to sell this stock at 197/. per cent, and Mr> Knight paid them the difference Of the ad-1 vanced price.

Sir John Fellows being examined ns to ther fictitious stock sold, says, that he heard that Mr. Rolt, of Hertfordshire, had some stock held for him by the-Company: and says, that he did not pay the money for it, (as this examinant believes) that he has also heard Mr. Wynn, a member of parliament, had some stock held for *Iiim in the same manner, without paying-lot it (as he believes): That be believes he has lately heard, that lord Lansdown and lord Gower i.ad/some of this stock held for them in the same manner: And that these things were generally transacted by Mr. Knight, and that he should rather believe that no money was paid by them for it.

Mr. James Colebrookbeing examined, says,

that in December, 1719, he became acquainted with sir William Gordon (one of the commissioners of the army accounts) the examinant having then a memorial depending before the said commissioners: That he was told by

* 35] VAffiL. ftlSTORY, VGeoSg* I. 1121. — ike SouA Sea Company. (88 *

Mr., Dent, a clerk there, that sir William seeing that memorial, asked him if it was the examinant’s? Which Mr. Dent said it wasthat the warrant upon it was signed, and sir William came to the examinant the next day, and told him he had signed his warrant, and desired Some of the subscription, which the examinant then took in; and he desired to hare 5,000l. of it; the examinant told him, he would speak to some of the managers, which he did; and thereupon sir William Gordon bad $,000l. of that subscription; and' the examinant gave him $,000l. of his owo; that this was the beginning of his acquaintance with sir William Gordon; that on or about the 17th of February, 1719, sir William Gordon, (whom your Committee observe charged in the said account df stock sold, to have bought 7,000l. part thereof) gave the examinant orders to give out IS gdineas per cent, for the refusal of South-Sea stock, for three months, at the rate of 200/. per cent. And tjie examinant, the next day (as he remembers) informed sir William by letter, that he had accordingly done it for 5,000l. stock; that his partner, Mr. Ruck, signed the contracts for $, 600/. part of it; and the examinant indorsed a contract made by Mr. Boys of Kept, for the remaining 4,000l. About the middle of May, sir William demanded a performance of this bargain, which was accordingly completed, and he believes sir William gained considerably thereby.

That in February, or the beginning of March, 1719, on or about the day when the House of Commons was in a Committee about the South-Sea bill, sir William Gordon came to the examinant, and desired him to lend him some thousand pounds on South-Sea stock, he believes, a sum to purchase no less than 4,000l. South-Sea stcck, which the examinant told him did not suit his conveniency to do, and the examinant refused it; he was very pressing: Upon this he desired the examinant to go with him to Mr. Knight, but the examinant cannot remember whether sir William Gordoajpr he first mentioned Mr. Knight’s name: This examinant accordingly did go along with him, And they found Mr. Knight and Mr. HnWes together, in the treasury-room, at the Soyth-Sea House. Mr. Hawes came to the examinant, and asked him, who that was with him ? He told him it was sir William Gordon, Mr. Hawes asked what he wanted? The examinant said he wanted money, which it did not suit his convenience to supply him, or words to that effect. Upon this Mr. Hawes went to Mr. Knight, and Mr. Knight came to sir William, and the examinant told Mr. Knight what sir William Gordon wanted; then Mr. Knight and sir William went to the other end of the room, and the examinant believes that Mr. Knight then let air William bare some of the South-Sea Company’s stock at the market price, without paying any money for it, hut does not know what •urn; his reason for his belief in this matter is, because in conversation with sir William Gor-

don, in May following, he told the examinant, that he had made up with Mr. Knight the stock which Mr. Knight had accommodated him with, which the examinant now believes was the Company’s stock, which Mr. Knight had let sir William have in February or March, 1719, at aforesaid; that he thinks sir William mentioned his thus making it up by way of regret, that he should have made it up so soon, the stock soon afterwards rising higher than it was at that time.

The said William Dent being examined, says he did apply several times to have Mr. Cole-brook’s debentures signed; that be spoke to all the commissioners, particularly to sir William Gordon; that at the same time, sir William asked the examinant, whether Mr. Cole-brook was the same person that was concerned in the undertaking, called Ram’s and Cole* brook’s insurance ? The examinant told him be was: Upon which sir William said be must have some of it; and sir William desired the examinant to meet him in the city, for be wanted to speak to Mr. Colebrook; that the examinant acquainted Mr. Colebrook thereof and sir William and the examinant met hie accordingly; *but the examinant cannot say whether they met at Mr. Cole brook’s house or at a tavern; nor does he remember the. conversation, or whether the debenture was signed before or after that time; that some time between Christmas and the expiration of the commission, on the 10th of March, 1719, Mr. Colebrook told the examinant (to the best of his remembrance) that he had let sir William Gordon have 5,000l. of the receipts of the said insurance, 2,000l. whereof was Mr. Colebrook’s, and 5,000l. he bought in order to accommodate sir William.

Mr. Francis Hawes being thereupon exa-

mined, says, that he remembers sir William Gordon came with Mr. Colebrook to the Sooth Sea house, to the examinant; and that Mr. Colebrook spoke to the examinant to recommend sir William Gordon to Mr. Knight, and the examinant believes, upon that application, he did recommend sir William to Mr. Knight, but the examinant cannot remember upon what account.

And yoor Committee farther acquaint’ the House, that in the book mentioned in their former report to have been delivered in to your Committee, by the present directors of the South Sea Company, (intitled, An Account of the names of such persons to whom loans haye been made on South-Sea stock, who at that time, when such loans were made, do not appear by any hooks to have transferred the stock to the South-Sea Company, for the security thereof) your Committee do find the names of several of the persons mentioned in this their report, contained in the said account, of whose names, as also the [/articular sums borrowed, and the stock supposed to be transferred by them, your Committee transcribe out of the said books, as followeth, vis.

Farther Debate concerning the Allowances to he given to the South-Sea Directors out of their Estates."] June 1. In a grand committee of the South-Sea Sufferers’ Bill, the Commons resumed the consideration of what Allowances should be given to the late Directors out of their Estates; and, continuing in the alphabetical order, began with sir Robert Chaplin. Lord Molesworth, and sir John Eyles, having spoke in his favour, it was agreed, without dividing, to allow him 10,000l. and the same allowance was given to sir William Chapman, Mr. Chester, and Mr. Child.

A motion being made to give Mr. De la Porte the like sum, the lord Molesworth was for reducing it to 7,000l. but upon the question, whether to allow him 10,000l. or 7, 00 it was carried for 10,000l. by 150 votes against 69.

Mr. Eyles’s case appearing in a favourable light, he was allowed 20,000l. without dividing; and Mr. Edmonson’s estate amounting to little more than 5,000l. it was moved to allow him the whole, and to leave him out of the bill; but after some debate, it was agreed to allow him only 3,000l.

Then the question was put, whether to allow Mr. Gibbon* 15, 0CK)/. or 10,000l. and it was resolved for the latter without dividing.

* This Mr. Edward Gibbon was the grandfather of our celebrated Historian, who, in the Memoirs of his own Life and Writings, has given us the following interesting account of his ancestor:

“ The successful industry of my grandfather raised him above the level of his immediate ancestors; he appeared to hate launched into

various and extensive dealings; even his opinions were subordinate to his interest; and I find him in Flanders, clothing king William’s troops, while be would have contracted with morq pleasure, though not perhaps at a cheaper rate, for the service of king James. During his residence abroad, his concerns at home were managed by his mother Hester, an active and notable woman. Her second husband was a widower, of the name of Acton; they united the children of their first nuptials. After hif marriage with the daughter of Richard Acton, goldsmith in Leadennall-street, he gave his own sister to sir Whitmore Acton, of Aldenr; ham; and I am thus connected, by a triple alliance, with that ancient and loyal family of Shropshire baronets. It consisted about that time of seven brothers, all of gigantic stature; one of whom, a pigmy of six feet two inches, confessed himself the last and least of the seven; adding, in the true spirit of party, that such men were not born since the Revolution. Under the Tory administration of the four last years of queen Anne, (1710 — 1714) Mr. Edw. Gibbon was appointed one of the commissioners of the customs; he sat at that board with Prior; but the merchant was belter qualified for hit station /than the poet; since lord Bolingbroke has been beard to, declare, that he had never conversed with a man, who more clearly understood the, commerce and finances of England In the year 1716, he was elected one of the Directors of the South Sea.Company; and his books exhibited the proof that, before his acceptance of this fata) office, h4 had acquired an independent fortune of sixty thousand pounds.

“ But his fortune was overwhelmed in the shipwreck of the year twenty, and the labours of thirty years were blasted in a single day. Of the use or abuse of the South Sea scheme, of the guilt or innocence, of my.grandfather and his brother Directors, I am neither a competent nor a disinterested judge. Yet the equity of modern’ times must condemn the violent and arbitrary proceedings, which would have disgraced the Cause of justice, and would render injustice still more odious. No sooner had the nation awakened from its golden dream, than a popular and even a parliamentary clamour demanded their victims; but it was acknowledged, on all sides, that the South Sea Directors, however guilty, could not be touched by any known laws of the land. The speech of lord Molesworth, the author of the St^te of Denmark, may shew the temper, or rather the intemperance, of the House of Commons.

‘ Extraordinary crimes (exclaimed that ardent

It was proposed to give Mr. Hawes 1,000l. but sir Nathaniel Gould having observed, that be was very active in the late vile practices, and bad occasioned the ruin of many people, particularly of some gentlemen he had been under in the Navy-Office, Mr. Docminicque moved thereupon, and it was agreed, without dividing, to allow him only 3l£ being the odd money.of the particulars of hi* estate.

lord Hmcbinbroke and sir Robert Rich spoke in favour of Mr. Horsey, and moved for allow-

ing him 10,000l. which was carried without dividing; after which it was debated, whether to allow Mr. Holditch 500/. 1,000l. or 5,000l. the voices were equally divided, viz. 80 and 86. upon which Mr. Clayton, the chairman, gavtf the casting vote for 5,000l.

June 2. The Commons, in a grand Com* rnittee, proceeded on the same affair, and began with sir Theodore Janssen: Mr. Horatio Walpole and sir Richard Steele having spoke in his favour, they were answered by general Ross

* a sack, and cast headlong into the river; and ‘ I shall be content to inflict the same treat-‘ inent on the authors of our present ruin.’ His motion was not literally adopted; but a bill of pains and penalties was introduced, a retroactive statute, to punish the offences, which did not exist at the time they were committed. Such a pernicious violation of liberty aind law can be excused only by the most imperious necessity; nor could it be defended on this occasion by the plea of impending danger dr useful example. ‘ The legislature restrained the per*ons of the Directors, imposed an exorbitant security for their appearance, and marked their characters with a previous note of ignominy; they were compelled to deliver, upon oath, the strict value of their estates; and were disabled from making any transfer or alienation of any part of their property. Against a bill of pains and penalties it is the common right of every subject to be heftfd by his counsel at the bar; they prayed to be beard; their prayer was refused; and their oppressors, who required no evidence, would listen to no defence. It had been at first proposed that one-eighth of their respective estates should be allowed for the future support of the Directors; but it was speciously urged, that in the various shades of opulence and guilt, such’an' unequal proportion would be too light for many, and for some might possibly be tod heavy. The character and conduct of each man were separately weighed; but, instead of the calm solemnity of a judicial inquiry, the fortune and honour of 33 Englishmen were made the topic of hasty conversation, the sport of a lawless majority; amf the basest member of the committee, by a malicious -word or a silent vote, might indulge his general spleen or personal animosity. Injury was aggravated by insult, and insult was embittered by pleasantry. Allowances of twenty pounds, or one shilling, were facetiously moved. A vague report that a Director had formerly been concerned in another project, by which some unknown' persohs had lost their money, was admitted as a proof of Jus actual guilt. One man was ruined because he had dropt a foolish speech, that his horses should feed upon gold; another because he was grown so proud, that, one day at the treasury, he had refused a civil answer to persons much above him. All were condemned, absent and unheard, in arbitrary fines and forfeitures, which swept away the greatest part of their substance. Such bold

oppression can scarcely fie shielded by the om- nipotence of parliament; and yet it may be seriously questioned, whether the judges of the South Sea Directors were the true and legal representatives of their bountry. The first par-- liament of George the 1st had been chosen (1715) for three years; the term had elapsed, their trust was expired: and the four additional years (1718 — 1722 ), during, which they continued to sit, were derived not from the people, but from themselves; from the strong measure of the septennial bill, which can only be paralleled by ‘ il serar di consiglio’ of the Venetian history. Yet candour will own, that to the same parliament, every Englishman is deeply indebted: the septennial pet, so vicious in its origin, has been sanctioned by time, experience, and the national consent. Its first operation secured the House of Hanover on the throne, and its permanent influence maintains the peace and stability of government. As often as a repeal has been moved in the House of Commons, I have given in its defence a clear and conscientious vote.

“ My grandfather could not expect to be treated with more lenity than his companions. His Tory principles and connections'rendered him obnoxious to the ruling powers; his name is reported in a suspicious secret; and his well-known abilities could not plead the excuse of igoorance or error. In the first proceedings against the South Sea Directors, Mr. Gibbon is one of the few who were taken into custody; and, in the final sentence, the measure of his fine proclaims him eminently guilty. The total1 estimate which he delivered on oath to the House of Commons amounted to 106, 543/. 5#.

6d., exclusive of antecedent settlements. Two different allowances of 15 and of 10,000l. were moved for Mr. Gibbon; but, on the question being put, it was carried without a division, for the smaller sum. On these ruins, with the ‘ skill' and credit, of which parliament had not been able to despoil him* my grandfather at a mature age erected the edifice of anew fortune; the labours of sixteen years were amply rewarded; and I have reason to believe that the second structure was not much inferior to the first. He had realized a very considerable property in Sussex, Hampshire/Buckinghamshire, and the New River Company; and had acquired a spacious house; with gardens and lands, at Putney, in Surrey, where he resided in decent hospitality. He died in Dee, 1736, at the age of seventy.’ ’

and sir Joseph Jekyll; but Mr. Trenchardmov-ing for allowing him 50,000l. and the question being put thereupon, it was carried in the affirmative, by a majority of 134 votes against 118. v

Sir Jacob Jacobson being one of those who had the least share in the management of the fraudulent scheme, Mr. Hungerford moved to allow him 11,000l. which was all his estate, except 481/. 4s. which was agreed to without a negative.;

Mr. Ingram’s case being much the like, Mr. Pulteney moved for allowing him 12,000l. near three fourths of his estate, and being seconded by lord Hincfainbroke, it was carried without dividing.

The next was sir John Lambert: some members were inclined to believe him innocent, as to the first projection of. the villainous scheme, and thereupon a motion was made to give him SO,000l. some would have'reduced it to 10,000l. pome to 5,000l. and some to 3,000l. But at last the question being put for 5,000l. it was carried without dividing.

Then it was moved, and carried without opposition, to allow sir Harcourt Master 5,000l. and in the same manner Mr. Morley bad 1, 800/. allowed him.

A Member having moved to allow Mr. Page 10,000l. another would have reduced it to 5,000l., but the question being put, which of the two sums should be given him, it was carried for 10,000l. without a division.

. Col. Raymond was. next; and his case appearing favourable, Mr. Heyshain moved for allowing him 30,000l. and being seconded by Mr. Tuffull, sir Robert Raymond, and Mr. Hunger-ford, do opposition was made to Mr. Heysham’s motion.

After this, Mr. Sloper moved for allowing Mr* Read 10,000l., and, being backed by sir Jphu Ward and Mr. Docininicque, the same was carried without any debate.

In the like manuer the sum of 14,000l. was allowed to Mr, Reynolds.

June 3. Mr. Hungerford having moved for allowing Mr. Sawbridge 10,000l. he was opposed by Mr. Lowndes, lord Moles worth, sir AdolphusOughton, and Mr. Horatio Walpoles but at last, a member moving for 5,000l. it was agreed to without dividing. Ia the same manlier, the sum of 15,000/, was allowed to Mr. Tillard, and 800/. to Mr. Turner, which was pear his whole estate.

Having gone through with the Directors, the Committee proceeded $o Mr. Surmen, the Deputy Cashier, whose case occasioned a debate ef about an hour and a half.

Mr. Grey Neville, who spoke most in his be-

half, represented, That in the course of the whole affair he had only acted as a servant, and by the command either of' Mr. Knight, or of the Directors, and therefore strenuously insisted, that he might be left out of the bill.

Mr. Arthur Moore spoke likewise in his fa-^oqr, apd moved to allow bin* 30,000l.

Mr. Hungerfor^ vould have reduced it t* 80,000l.

Mr. Lechmere to 12,000l.

Another member to 10,000l. and another to 5,000l. AU these were opposed by sir Joseph Jekyll, serjeant Pengelly, and Mr, Horatio Walpole, who would not have allowed him above 20/. or 30/. At last the question being put for allowing him 5,000l. it was agreed to without dividing. ! . '

June 10. The Commons, in a Committee of the whole House; considered farther of the South Sea Sufferers’ Bill, particularly with relation, to the Allowances to be given to'Mr. Grigsby,

Mr. Arthur Moore moved to allow him 10,000l. but

Another member said, That since that upstart was once so prodigally vain, as to bid fiis coachman feed his horses with gold, no doubt but he could feed on it himself; and therefore he moved, That be might be allowed as much gold as he could eat, and that, the rest of his estate might go towards the relief of the sufi» ferers.

. After this a motion being made for allowing him 2,000l. it was carried without a division.

Mr. Aislabie’s case came next under consideration.

Mr. Robert Walpole moved, that sp much of his estate might be allowed him, as he was possessed of towards the end of the year 1719, before the South Sea bill was brought in, * and

* That Mr. Aislabie took an active part in behalf of the first Proposal of the South Sea Directors, [See p. 626.J in January 1720, appears from the following extract of a letter from Mr. Thomas Brodrick to the Lord Chancellor Middleton.

“ Friday (the day of great expectation) the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in pretty general terms, opened the South Sea Company’s scheme of a proposal for putting the National Debt in such a way of payment as might effect it in the shortest time possible: This he gave us to understand, would be 25 years; but Mr. Lechmere, in the subsequent part of the debate, eked it out to 26 years. After Mr. Aislaby had spent above an hour in his harangue, the secretary got up ', congratulated him upon the clear and perfectly intelligible light he had put the matter in, and the nation on the prospect they had hereby of fiuding them-, selves out of debt sooner than was generally expected: concluding, that no other regular motion could be made, than that the chairman should report our having made soeqe progress,

and desiring leave to sit again: for that he took for granted, every gentleman’s being ready aad willing to receive a proposal from the South Sea Company, upon the foot of what bad been so well opened. A profound silence ensued for a full quarter of an hour: every body expecting who would first rise.; when the secretary getting up to make his motion in foon, I

this motion was backed by Mr. Erie, sir Charles Hot ham, Mr. Lowndes, Mr. Lecbmere, Mr. Ward, and Mr. Palmer. On the other hand, Mr. Freeman moved, that all he bad got since the year 1714, might be confiscated and applied to the use of the public; and he was supported by

- Sir Joseph Jckyll, who urged, That it was in the power of the fords of the treasury to have prevented the mischief that had been done by the Directors.

Mr. Brpdrick, Mr. Slopes, sir William Wynd-hain, and some others, spoke on the same side, , and the question being put, That, all the estate which Mr. Aislabie was possessed of in the year 1719, be left for him and his family; the same, upon a division, was carried in the negative by a majority of 18 votes. Then another motion was made, and the question put, for allowing him and his family ai! the estate be was possessed of on the 20th of October 1718, which was carried in the affirmative by a majority of 113 voices agaicst 95.

' rose, and was pointed to.. I readily agreed with the two gentlemen who bad spoke, that till the national debt was discharged, or at least in a fair way of being so, we were not to expect making that figure we formerly had. I said, I could go farther, making use of the expression of a gentleman (Mr. Hutcheson) who told us in a former session, that till this was done, we could not (properly speaking) call ourselves a nation; that therefore every scheme or proposal tending thereto, ought to be received and considered. But that the occasion of my now speaking was, that the first gentleman who spoke, seemed to me to recommend the scheme not only in opposition, but even exclusively of all others:and that the next had chimed in with him; that I hoped, in order to make the best bargain we could, every other company, nay any other society of men might be at as foil liberty to make proposals as the South Sea Company, since every gentleman must agree this to be the likeliest way to make a good bargain for the public.

“ Our great men looked as if thunderstruck, and one of them in particular, turned as pale as my cravat. Upon this ensued a debate of above two hours. .Our ministers (as they might in a committee) spoke again and again; for their auxiliaries proved faint hearted. Mr. Aislaby, in heat, used this unguarded expression; Things of this nature must be carried on with a spirit; to which sir Joseph Jekyll, with a good deal of warmth, took very just exception; This spirit, says he, is what has undone the nation; our business is to consider thoroughly, deliberate calmly, and judge of the whole upon reason. not with the spirit men-

tioned. Mr. Aislaby desired to explain; said he only meant that credit was, to be so supported; which caused some smiliag. Mr. Walpole applauded the design, and agreed in general to the reasonableness of the scheme, wherein however something wanted amendment, and others (although but few) were unreasonable; but concluded strongly for hearing all, as indeed every body did, three or four only excepted. Mr. Lechmere answered him but little, God wot, to the matter in band: for quitting that, he fell into invectives against Walpole's former scheme, giving great preference to this. The town says, the bargain with dm South Sea company was agreed at nu chambers, between Mr. Aislaby, sir George Caawel ), and three or four other South Sea men; since which they say Mr. Aislaby has bought 87,000 stock.

“ We often observe how far passion carries men beyond reason, and certainly interest has generally the same effect; for Walpole being irritated, rose again, and began with shewing, by papers in his hand, how very’unfairly Lechmere had represented facts, then proceeded to shew his fallacious way of reasoning, and concluded with going more particularly into the scheme, which in several material parts he exposed sufficiently. Lechmere rose up, but he took time to consider, whilst -another had spoke, in order to reply; .but this was prevented by the whole committee rising at once, and going into the floor; the chairman tore his throat with “ to order, hear your member/' but all to no purpose^ other .than to mortify Lechmere, by the members crying out, “ we bave heard him long enough."

' Resolutions of the Commonsfor the re-establishing of Public Credit.] Mr. Farrer reported from the Committee of the whole House, tp whom it was referred to consider of the State of the Public Credit of this kingdom, the Resolutions they had directed him to report to the House, which are as follow, viz.

1. “ That it is the opinion of this Committee, that, for the re-establishing of the Public Credit and quieting the minds of his majesty’s subjects, the several properties and interests now depending ana concerned with the South-Sea Company, be ascertained and settled.

2. *That in order to put an end to all disputes between the South-Sea Company and the proprietors of the redeemable funds subscribed into the said Company, and for the further relief of the said proprietors, and the proprietors of the second, third and fourth money subscriptions, who have now Stock allowed them at the rate of 400 per cent, with the last Midsummer dividend of ten per cent, in stock, in addition after the rate of 33/. 6s. 8 stock upon every 100/. stock already allowed, be given by the South-Sea Company to the proproprietors of the said redeemable funds, and to the proprietors of the second, third and fourth money subscriptions.

' 3. That the sum of 4, 156, 341/. with the four years and half, and one year’s purchase, payable to the public by the South-Sea Company, be remitted, so as from the 24th June, 1722, two millions of the capital stock of the said Company be reduced and annihilated, and a proportionable part of their Annuity or yearly fund, in respect of the said two millions, from that time cease.

4. u That the second subscription of the irredeemables, as well the Long Annuities as the Annuities of nine per cent. Prize Lottery Tickets and Blank Lottery Tickets, be made equal to the first subscription of the like Annuities and Tickets, by an addition of stock at 150 per cent.

5. il That all the capital South-Sea Stock, belonging to the Company in their own right, which, after the proposed distribution made, shall remain undisposed of, be divided among all the proprietors of the said Company, in proportion to their several and respective interests therein; and that credit be giverf them for the same in the books of the said Company.

6. “ That all demands for money borrowed

Of the South Sea Company, for which there is actually pledged stock, after the rate of400/. or under, for each 100/. stock, with the last Midsummer Dividend, or on subscription receipts after the rate of 300/. or under, for each subscription receipt for 100/. be discharged, and the property of the said stock and subscription receipts be absolutely vested in the said Company, aivd that the said Company do accept this slock of the said Company after the rate of 300/. per cent, in repayment of any sum or sums ofmoney borrowed of the Said Company, on stock, or subscription receipts, at any price exceeding the rates aforesaid, the same being tendered within a time to be limited/ ’

The first and second of these Resolutions was readily agreed to. The Third occasioned a long debate; many members, particularly Mr. Huugerford and most of the courtiers, insisting to have the whole seven millions remitted; but they were opposed by' Mr. Sloper and several others, and upon a division it was carried by 166 voices against 155, to agree with the Committee, in the said Resolution. The 4th and 5th were also approved without opposition; but the 6th occasioned another warm debate; and, among the rest, Mr. Dominicqne said, with indignation, He wondered fcny body that bad

* borrowed money, and refused to pay it, could

* look any body in the face.’ Another member proposed, That the borrowers should pay ten per cent, on all the money borrowed, over and above the stock pawned; but it was at last resolved, That the said 6th Resolution be recemf-mitted.

June 12. The Commons in a grand Committee, considered further of the State of the Public Credit, and came to the following Resolutions, which were agreed to by the House, as follows, viz.

1. That such persons as have borrowed money, from the South-Sea Company upon South-Sea Stock, actually transferred and pledged at the time of borrowing, to or for the use of the said Company, shall, upon payment of 10 per cent, upon the respective sums so borrowed, at a time or times to be limited, and not otherwise, be discharged from all further demands of the said Company iu respect of the-monies so borrowed:and that all the stock so transferred and pledged, together with all dividends and profits thereto belonging respectively, be absolutely vested in the said Company.

2. “ Tfiat such persons as have borrowed-money from the South-Sea Company upon subscription receipts actually pledged to the said Company at the time of borrowing, shall, upon, payment of ten per cent, upon the respective sums so borrowed, at a time or times to be li-’ mited, and not otherwise, be discharged all further demands in respect of the monies so borrowed:aud that all the subscription receipts so pledged, together with all dividends and profits thereunto belonging, be absolutely vested in the said Company.” .

mittee of Secrecy on the Proceedings of the South Sea Company.] r June 16. Mr. Broderick made the seventh and last Report from the Committee of Secrecy, which he read, ns follows.

Seventh and last Report of the Committee of Secrecy on the Proceedings Of the South Sea Company ^

That the Committee of Secrecy appointed to inquire into .all the proceedings relating to the execution of an Act, passed the last session of parliament, intitled, — An Act for enabling the South Sea Company to increase their present capital stock and fund, .by redeeming. such public debts and incum-f brances as are therein mentioned; and for raising money, for payment of several of the public debts and incumbrances; and, for calling in the' present Exchequer Bills .remaining uncancelled:and for making forth new bills, in lieu thereof, to be circulated and exchanged, upon demand, at or near the Exchequer; pursuant to the instruction given them by the House oo the 25th of April last, That .they should inquire what public money hath been employed by any treasurer, cashier, collector, receiver, or other officer concerned in the receipt or payment of public money, or of* any other part of his majesty’s revenue, or by any in trust for them, or by their order, in buying stock, or subscriptions, in the South Sea, or any other Company, or annuities, or other parliamentary securities:or otherwise making use of, or employing, the sarnie to their private advantage, since the 1st day of December 1719, have accordingly proceeded to inquire into that matter; and have examined, in the most solemn manner, the following persons; and do lay before the House the Examinations by them taken, relating thereto, in the words of the Examinations themselves.

Mr. Francis Hawes, being examined, says, That in the months of February, March, or April, 1719-20, about 25,000l. part of the money received for the service of his majesty’s navy, was laid out in purchasing 11,000l. South Sea Stock, by the order, and for the use of Richard Hampdeq, esq. then treasurer of the navy.

That 5,000l. part of the said 11,000l. stock, was sold for the benefit of the said Richard Hampden, esq. in a very short time.after it was bought, that it was bought at about 164, and sold at about 199 per cent, that the remaining 6,000l. stands in the name of Mr. .Thomas Hawes, in trust for the said Mr. Hampden.

That there were farther sums paid out-of the money received for the service of his majesty’s navy, by the order, and for the use of Mr. Hampden, viz. For the three several payments on 3,000l. first subscription, about S, 600/. For the first payment on 3,000l. second subscription, 1, 200/. which last mentioned sub-scrjpUpn was spld for the same oqoney it cost

1721. — of the South Sea Company* [838

for the use of Mr. Hampden. For the first payment on 1,000l. third subscription 1,000l.

Mr. Thomas Hawes, being examined, says, that 5,000l. SouthSda Stock was bought about the middle of February, at about 164/. per cent, by the order and for the use of Richard Hampden, esq. then treasurer of his majesty's navy, and paid for by his order out of the cash then in the hands of the examinant, as cashier to the said treasurer of the navy; and the said A,000 Lstock was sold about the beginning of March following, at about 199/. per cent, for the use of Mr. Hampden. — That, the farther sum of about 6,000l. South Sea Stock was bought and paid for in like manner, at about 925/. per cent, which is now in the examinant's hands, io trust for the said Mr. Hampden. — That 3,000l. in the first money, subscription, 3,000l. in the second money- subscription, 1,000l. in the third money subscription, and 5,000l. in the fourth money subscription, were bought and paid for out of the public cash of the navy, by order and for . the use of the said Mr. Hampden as aforesaid.

Your Committee directed sir Harctaurt Master, late receiver general of the land tax foe London and Middlesex, to lay before them an account of what public money he bad laid out instockor subscription, or otherwise appliedr to his own private use; and thereupon he laid before your Committee a paper to the effect following, viz. — That he had, in obedience to the order of your Committee, used his best endeavours to distinguish particularly, what sums of the public money he had laid out in stock or subscriptions, or bubbles, or applied to any other purpose, for his own or any other erson’a private account; .but he not having ept any accounts of the government’s^ money distinct and separate frofn other monies that-were his own, or others, that passed through his hands, he found it impracticable for him to give an account thereof so particularly as was required. — That he truly. believes be was so " unhappy as to lay out the whole debt due from him to the crown, being 37, 280/. 7s. 2 £, (as

it is set forth in the particular of his estate, delivered to one of the barons of the court of exchequer) in South Sea Stock, and in the third and fourth South Sea subscriptions, on his own account, by which he is a very great loser.

Your Committee, ^since thdir Report mads to the House, the 22dday of May last, concerning the loans made by the South Sea Company upon stock and subscriptions, have made a further progress in that part of their enquiry, and do now lay before the House such examinations as they have taken since that Report, in relation to that matter, in the words of the examinations themselves.

Mr. Samuel Watts being examined, says, that from the 1st of June, 1720, he has served as xlerk in the treasury office of the South Sea Company, under Mr. Christopher Clayton, in making out the several books relating to loans upon stock and subscriptions, the account of which had- been at first enteret} in three ori-

S39} PAUL. HIST. 7 GrEORtiBl. 1721. — Seventh and last Report on the Proceedings [840

ginal journals, two of them containing the loans on stock, and the last containing the loans on subscriptions*; all which journals, and all other books relating to the loans, were kept Under Mr. Clayton's care; but Mr. Sur-inan had the power of taking and inspecting them when he thought fit. That from those three original journals, five ledgers were made, chiefly by the examinant, and partly by Clayton, or some other clerk; but the examinant bad instructions for what he did from Mr. Clayton, and no other person; that these ledgers were marked, A. B. C. D and £. — That -he has sometimes had the said original journals in his custody for a day pr thereabouts, and the examinant observed there were many razhies and alterations made in them. That the examinant1 himself did, at several times, snake many alterations in the said ledgers, both in the names and sums, according to several papers and instructions, from time to time given him by Clayton, who afterwards took such papers from him; and the last time be made any such alterations, was about the middle of November last.1 — That he made a copy of the said original journals of loans on •nbscriptions, winch copy now remains in a peat chest marked No. 2.a^ the South Sea /bouse, where the examinant has seen it since the new directors were chosen. — That after that copy was made, two leaves were torn out •f the said original journal, but by whom the examinant cannot tell; and the examinant saw Mr. Clayton writing names out of those leaves, and he called to the examinant, and told him be believed be must tear out a leaf from the copy, in order to bring in fictitious names. — That in one of the said leaves torn out, there -was an entry, To sundries 26,000l. which the examinant, by Mr. Clayton's order, entered in the said copy in 26 fictitious names, at 1,000l. each:and there being'hnother entry of 1,000l. without any name to 'it, the examinant likewise entered that sum in a. fictitious name, by Clayton's direction. — That in the same leaf there was set down 11,000l. stock to lordCas-tlemain, and 4,000l. stock to lord Londonderry, which Clayton directed {he examinant to alter and enter in fictitious names; but the examinant could notdo it, the paper being wet,

That about the beginning of November last, the said five ledgers, marked A, B, Cj D and E, were copied alphabetically into four new ledgers, which are now kept in the office for *j»ublic use; and if any disputes arise in searching into them, the clerks have recourse to the paid first ledgers.

That Mr. Clayton did, a little before the meeting of the parliament, bring into the treasury office a book, which the examinant believes was Mr. Knight's private cash-book, t^e examinant having often seen it, in which, at she head of an account, he saw the name of Charles Stanhope; and this examinant says, that Clayton, with a white handle pen-knife, erased the letters in the name Stanhope, in order to make it Stangape; but whether Mr.

Clayton altered the letters with his own hand* or the examinant by his order, the examinant does not now remember, but says it was accordingly altered to Stangape. That this book had a green cover, was about a foot in length, and about two thirds as broad, aqd an inch and an half thick *

The said Mr. Clayton being hereupon examined by your Committee says, he believes there are alterations made in the original journals of the loans; that all the alterations which the examinant, or any other clerk by his order made in those journals, were madg by the direction of Mr. Knight; that Mr. Surman once, by Mr. Knight's order, directed the examinant to alter four names. — That the examinant directed the altering several largesums into lesser sums; and that he was informed by Mr. Knight, that such alterations were made at the request of the persons to whom ^uch large suras were charged. — That lie does not know that such names were altered into fictitious names, but that there were 16 or 21 fictitious names added to the original journals; that Mr. Knight gave the examinant a list of such names, and told him any names would do. — 1That all the alterations made in the letters of any names, were made by Mr, Knight's order. — That he does not remember that he ever gave directions to any clerk to insert fictitious names, save the said 16 or 21 names.

That he knows not that the name of any ipember of parliament was altered to any-other name; but Mr. Knight told the examinant that a large sum being set down to lord Castiemain, his lordship said, that part of such sum was on the account of other persons, (a list of whose names his lordship gave to Mr. Knight) and the sum at first set down to lord Castiemain, was accordingly split into lesser sums, and set down to those persons.

That he saw the original Journals in Mr. Knight's custody about three days before he went away, but has not seen them since. — That he has seen Mr. Knight’s green book; but he never made any rasure or alteration in it, either in any name, or any letter, or part of a name in that book, nor ever directed any, to be made. '

That he does not remember he ever saw the name (Stanhope) in the said green book; and denies, that he ever rased any letter, or' part of a letter, or made any alteration in the name (Stanhope) in the said green book. That he cannot be positive, whether the name (Stanhope) was ever rased or altered in any other book whatsoever. But he does not know or remember, that he did direct any such rasure or alteration made in the said name (Stanhope). — That he remembers he did orice alter a i figure in an account in the said green book, i when Mr. Knight and a gentleman were set-[tling an account in that book; but who the; gentleman was, the examinant cannot tell.

That he does not know but the name of at 1 William Tompson might have been altered to:Mr. William Tompson, and thinks it was aK

841] PARL. HISTORY, 7 Georgs I.

tered.- That he has heardxMr. Knight say, that sir William Tompson complained, that there was a mistake in his account of the loan, and the examinant remembers he saw sir William Tompson with Mr. Knight in his closet

That the first ledgers of the loans were begun to be made from the joarnals in several books, and m October 1720, those ledgers not being ruled in a proper manner, there were mew ledgers provided, and the examinant believes sir William Tompson’s name Was altered in both the spiel original and new ledgers.

That the original journals were made up partly by the receipts taken at the transfer book, and partly by direction of Mr. Knight, and adjustments made with him.

That the nombers of the subscription-receipts, on which money was lent, were entered in the. journals; but the examinant believes there were some errors therein.

Mr. Clayton being farther examined as to the particular alterations made in the journal of the loans, says, the name (Brazier) was altered, and he believes, that person borrowed the-money for lord Rosse. And that there was a letter sent by his lordship, to desire an alteration might be made in that name, and it was accordingly made by Mr. Knight’s order. — That the name, (George Baker) was altered to (Baber) about the 30th of August, or the beginning of September 1720, by Mr. Knight’s order.- — That he believes the aim charged td colonel Amot was'altered and made les», and part of the sura at first set down to him, charged in other names. — That the sum charged to John Burridge, esq. was likewise altered, and made less, Mr. Burridge telling Mr. Knight that the money lent, was part of it on the account of Mr. Bowdige of lime. — That the sum charged to John Barber was lessened, and part of it set down to other persons. — That lord Carpenter’s, colonel Murray’s, and Pearse and company’s sums were altered, there being errors in their accounts. — That the sum charged to sir Caesar Child, was lessened.

That he does not remember, that there were any leaves torn or taken out of the original journals of the loans; and says, he did not take or tear out any. But opcm farther-recollection, he says, there were one or two leaves taken out; but such leaves did not (as the examinant believes) contain names of any persons, but only a computation of the totals of the loans. — That he does not remember that he ever mentioned to Mr. Watts, that a leaf or leaves must be taken out of the journal, or the copy of the journal, in order to insert fictitious names, or for any other purpose. — That after the loan was closed, Mr. Francis Eyles (one of the late directors) applied to the Committee of hoans, and had a direction for adding 18,000l. Sts a loan to him, that sum having been forgot, and that sam was accordingly added1 to the loan, vi*. 14, 080/* rathe name of the said Mr. Bytes, and 4,000k in the name of Lucy Barnton. — That he'verily believes the sums charged to lord Lonsdale) and lord Litchfield, were lent

1721. — of the South Sea [S'12

their lordships, before the loan was closed, and that they transferred stock for securing the money so lent.

The said Mr. Christopher Clayton being farther examined, says, that Mr. Samuel Watts was employed as a clerk in making oat the accounts of the loans, and was under the direction of this examinant, till the Committee of loans was appointed. — That he has nothing to object against Mr. Watts’s credit.

And being confronted with Mr. Watts, who affirming what he has said in his former exami-: nation, as to the rasure and alteration of the j name (Stanhope) into (Stangape) in Mr. Knight’s green book, and Mr. Watts relating to Mr. Clayton several circumstances at the time of such alteration, and Mr. Clayton having beard Mr. Watts’s examination read, he denies that (to, the best of his knowledge) he ever did erase •any letter or part of a letter in the name (Stanhope) in the said green book, or make or direct to be made any alteration in the name (Stanhope) in that book. — That (to the best of his remembrance) he never drd alter the name (Stanhope) into (Stangape) in any other book or direct any soch alteration to be made.

Your committee having shewn the aforegoing examination to the said Samuel Watts, and examining him farther in relation to this matter, in the presence of the said Christopher Clayton, Mr. Watts persists in, and affirms, what he has said in his former examination ', as to the alteration of the name (Stanhope) into -(Stangape); and farther says, that when he fi st saw' in the minntes of the House of Commons, that the name (Stanhope) had been altered into (Stangape) he verily believed it. had been the alteration made in Mr. Knight’s green book, as aforesaid, and, not in the books of Turner and company, as he has since heard.

Mr. John Handsard being examined, says, he became concerned, in the South Sea house about the 21st of July 1720, and was at first only employed to number the 3d subscriptionr receipts. That about the middle of December last, he was one of the eight clerks, who wefe employed in copying four ledgers of the loans, into other new ledgers; and that he observed many rasnres and alterations in the leidgers from which they transcribed them, bat he cannot remember the particular alterations. — That there wfere several loose sheets, which fie believes were copies of the original journal of the loans, to which he and the other clerks employed to copy the said ledgers, had recourse upon any mistakes; and in those loose sheets, the examinant observed many. razures and alterations. — That after the present session of parliament began, Mr. Knight gave the examinant directions to draw out a list of the exceeding? upon the loans, which he did from the. ledgers. — That Mr. Christopher Clayton was in great intimacy with Mr. Knight, and was appointed clerk of the loans, and had the principal direction in making out the books of loans* — That be knows Mr. Samuel Watrs, (who was a clerk concerned in the loans under

343] PARL. HIST. 7 George I. 1721. — King’* Message for a Subsidy to Sweden. [844

Mr. Clayton) and takes him to be a person of great-integrity.

Mr. Robert Surman being examined, says, that since the enquiry began, the examinant has seen the original journals of the loans at. the South-Sea house; that Mr. Clayton was the clerk appointed to take care of the loans, and these journals were properly under his care. — That he believes there were several alterations made in these original journals, but he believes all such alterations were made by Mr. Knight’s direction given to, Mr. Clayton ' as the first clerk, who directed the other clerks to make the alterations, or else made them himself. ' -

That these journals were wrote by several clerks: That all loans, as well as adjustments, were (as the examinant believes) entered in these journals. — That the examinant has not seen these journals since - Mr. Knight went away. — That the original journals were not made alphabetically, but from day to day, as the money was lent out. — That the examinant remembers in two or three cases, he had orders from Mr. Knight to direct Mr. Clayton to make alterations iiv the journals, which the examinant takes to be where there was a large sum charged to particular persons, exceeding the regulati(>ns of the loans.

That Mr. Knight had the custody of the subscription-receipts on which money was lent for the months of June, July, and. August, 1720, and until the committee of loans was appointed; and the examinant believes the numbers of those receipts, were entered in the journals of loans. — That some of the first and second subscribers not making their first payment, Mr. Knight laid down the money for them, and took their receipts for his security, which (as the examinant had heard Mr., Knight say) brought his cash under difficulties; but nevertheless such subscribers bad a right to borrow, and often did borrow of the Company 300/. per cent, ou such subscriptions. — That the examinant has bad Mr. Knight’s orders, to direct Mr. Clayton to enter fictitious names in the journals of the loans on stock, the first commencing at the beginning of the loan and continued to May, 1720 ', the second carried on to Midsummer, and the third to the end of the loan, there being put xme original journal for the whole loan upon subscriptions. — That the said original journals were copied alphabetically, some time after the conclusion of each journal. — That he remembers he has seen Mr.' Knight and Mr. Clayton together, making alterations in the said original journals of the loans, and has heard Mr. Knight direct Clayton to make alterations therein, and enter fictitious names.

Mr. George Wooley, Mr. James Ottey, and Mr. Stephen Crisp, being examined, say, they were employed under Mr. Christopher Clayton, in making out the ledgers of the loans, which they accordingly did from foul.journals, which they do not believe were the original journals, nor did they ever see the originals, to

their knowledge:That Mr. .Clayton was the person who had the principal direction in making out the account of the loans. — That the examinants did, by Mr. Clayton’s direction, make several alterations in the said foul journals.

That the Paper annexed to their examination, (the three columns of which are intitled. Alterations made in names on the loan, alterations made in sums on the loan, names and sums added to the loan, which were not in the copy of the original journal) contains a full and true account of all such alterations made in the said four journals, as they can iiow. remember, a copy of which Paper your committee have annexed in an Appendix to this their Report.

Mr. Charles Clark being examined by your Committee (at the request of George Baker, esq.) says, that George Baker, esq. member of parliament, set out from London to the county ot Durham, on the 23d of February 1719, where (the examinant verily believes) he continued till November 1720; which the examinant can the better depose, because on the said 23d of February, 1719, Thomas Conyers, esq. and this examinant, were witnesses to the execution of an agreement by the said Mr. Baker; and this examinant very well remembers that he dined that day with Mr. Baker, and afterwards saw him take post; and the examinant corresponded weekly’with the said Mr. Baker, from that time till August 1720; when this examinant likewise .went •into the county of Durham; and there was frequently in company with the said Mr. Baker till the latter end of October 1720.

And now your Committee find themselves under a necessity of closing their Inquiry into the matters referred to them, by reason ' of the absence of Mr. Knight; who appears to have been principally, and in many instances, solely entrusted in the execution of this black and destructive South-Sea Scheme.

The King's Message for a Subsidy to ,

4-c.] June 16. Mr. Methuen delivered to the House the following Message from his majesty:

«G.

u His majesty having taken the first opportunity upon the death of the late king of Sweden, to renew the ancient Alliances between this kingdom and Sweden, and having stipulated by a Treaty to pay a subsidy to that crown, hath ordered that gTreaty to be laid before the House of Commons, and hopes from their known xeal and affection for the Protestant religion, and the true interest of their country, that they will enable him to make good the engagements he has entered into upon this occasion.

“ His majesty being informed that -two ships called ‘ the Bristol Merchant, ’ and Turkey Merchant, ’ now lying under quarantine, did arrive from Cyprus, and other parts of Turkey, infected with the plague, and have cotton, wool, and other goods on board which are dangerous to spread the infection; and conceiving

8151 PAUL. HISTORY, 7 Geo rob I. 1721: — Debate on the Commons thereon.[S I 6

it necessary; for the preservation of the health of his subjects, that the said ships and their ladings be burnt and destroyed, and that a reasonable satisfaction be given to the owners, hath, by advice of his privy-council, caused the value thereof to be computed by his majesty’s officers, and ordered those computations to be laid before the House of Commons, that provision may be made for satisfying the same.”

Debate in the Commons .] Most of

the members, who expected a Message of another nature and that they were to be acquainted with the near prospect of a peace in the North, were not. a little surprised at this demand of a Subsidy for Sweden: hereupon the consideration of the said Message was put oft* to the next day.

June 17. The House proceeded to consider the king’s Message, which was again read by Mr. Speaker. The copy of the Treaty between Great Britain and Sweden, January 21, 1719-20, and of its separate Articles, were also read. And a motion being made, “ That a supply be granted to his majesty, to make good :the Engagements be bad entered into with the crown of Sweden; and to give a reasonable satisfaction to the owners of the ships called,

4 The Bristol Merchant, ’ and the Turkey Merchant, ’ in case it were found necessary for the preservation of the health of his majesty’s subjects that the said ships and their ladings should be burnt and destroyed.” This motion < occasioned a long debate.

Mr. Shippen, sir Wm. Wyndham, sir Joseph Jekyll, lord Molesworth, and Mr. Butler, member for Sussex, who were against the motion, desired to know, Whether we were to give 72,000l. to Sweden, besides the maintaining a great fleet with 6,000 seamen in the Baltic, which they thought a sufficient charge to the nation, without paying so great a subsidy ? Urging, That before this last Treaty with Sweden, there had been a rupture between the two nations; and hostilities and great depredations committed by the Swedish privateers on our merchants; so that before any Subsidy be . given to that crown, accounts ought first to be stated and settled, and it might appear upon the balance, that Sweden is indebted to us.

To tins it was answered, by Mr. Robert Walpole, Mr. Horatio Walpole, Mr. Lech-mere, lord Barrington, and other courtiers, That the Subsidy allowed to Sweden by this •last Treaty, and the squadron sent to their assistance, was no more than had been stipulated ty former engagements:but that the said subsidy was not like to be demanded any more, the preliminaries of the peace between the Czar of Muscovy and the crown of Sweden, being iu a manner settled. Neither did the king desire any new tax for it, the Land and Malt-tax being sufficient to answer all this year’s expences.

Mr. R. Walpole added. That he was ex-‘ tremely glad, lv could at the same tune acquaint the House, that jus majesty ’s endeavours

to procure a general peace had been so successful, that an advantageous Treaty with Spain was actually agreed on and signed.

Hereupon, the motion for a Supply being carried without a division, the next question was, That the Houle go into a committee tar consider of that motion: The country party would fain have put it off to a long day; but the courtiers having moved for the 19th, it was carried without dividing.

June 19. The Commons went iDto a committee of the whole House to consider of the motion for a Supply; and at the same time took into consideration both his majesty’s Message, and the late Treaty with Sweden, upon which there arose a very warm debate.

Sir W. Wyndham declared himself against the Subsidy to Sweden, as an unnecessary charge.

Lord Molesworth went to the bottom of, and laid open, the whole affair of the northern war. His lordship said. That he would go as far as any man to maintain and support the honour and dignity of the crown of Great Britain; but that, on the other hand, he was not for squandering away unnecessarily the small remainder of the wealth of the nation. That by our late conduct we are become the Allies of the whole world, and the babbles of all eur allies: but when we have occasion for our allies, we are obliged to pay them well; and to that purpose his lordship instanced in the Dutch troops, that came over to our assistance in the late Rebellion. He added, That as to our alliances with Sweden, it was a matter of great intricacy and nicety; because the treaties which England has, in divers'times, made with Sweden, are partly contradictory; and thereupon his lordship entered into a detail of the treaties of Roschi'J and Travendall, made in the reigns of king Charles 2, and William 3. That the engagements lately entered into with the crown of Sweden were likewise, in some measure, contrary to the treaties subsisting with Denmark; particularly as to the securing to the duke of Holstein the dutchy of Sleswick; and directly opposite to the measures formerly concerted with the czar of Muscovy, in order to engage him to check the fierceness and ambition of the late king of Sweden. That, after all, it seemed unreasonable to expect that the czar should restore his conquests, whilst other princes kept the spoils of Sweden:- and therefore in order to engage the czar to yield what he had gained, it were but just that the king of Prussia should give up Stetin, and the elector of Hanover, Bremen, and Werden. His lordship owned, that the distressed condition to which the Swedes had been reduced, was really worthy of compassion:but that, on the other band, it must be considered, that they had been, in great measure, the authors of their own misfortunes, by their tame submission to a despotic, tyrannical prince, and by sacrificing their whole substance to enable him to carry on his unjust, rash, tmd ambitious designs; and that any nation who'followed their example

y

847] PARL. HISTORY, 7 George L

deserved the same fate. To this purpose, his lordship took notice of the hard usage of (he subjects of Mecklenburgh from their prince, which by the way, he shrewdly insinuated to have beeu one of the causes of the late rupture with the czar; but that after all, England ought not to intermeddle with the affairs of the empire, that the getting naval stores for our shipping was the main advantage we reaped from our trade in the Baltic: and'he owned that hemp was a very necessary commodity, particularly at this juncture, [At this expression there was a general laugh] but that, in his lordship’s opinion, if due encouragement were given to some of our plantations in America, we might be supplied from thence, at a much cheaper rate than from Sweden or Norway.

Mr. Robert Walpole, and Mr. H. Walpole answered lord Molesworth; who being supported by sir'Joseph Jekyl ), Mr. Lechmere replied to the latter; and the question being put, “ That a Supply be granted to his majesty to enable him to make good the Engagements he has entered iato with the Crown of Sweden ?” It was carried in the Affirmative, by 197 voices against 136. Then another question being put, “ That a Supply be granted to his Majesty, to be apptied to the satisfaction of the mastery, owners, and freighters of the ships Bristol Merchant/ and Turkey Merchant, ’ which are intended to be burnt and destroyed for preservation of his majesty’s subjects against the plague; it was carried without opposition.

June 20. Mr. Farrer reported the two Resolutions before-recited for granting a. Supply to his majesty* for the purposes thereto-mentioned, which were agreed to.

June 21. The Commons, in a grand committee, considered of the Supply, and resolved to grant to his majesty, 1. “ A sum not exceeding 72,000l. to enable him to make good the Engagements he had entered into with thee crown of Sweden. 2. A sum not exceeding 23, 935/. to be applied to the satisfaction of the owners of the two slaps, which were to be burnt and destroyed, for the preservation of his majesty’s subjects against the plague.”

Mr. Grey Neville's Speech in the House of Commons in favour of Mr. .] June 26.

Mr. Clayton reported the amendments made in a grand committee to the South-Sea Sufferers Bill, one of which being disagreed to, sir Thomas Cross moved, that the consideration of it might be put off till the Wednesday next following. This motion was seconded by Mr. Budge, deputy-governor of the South-Sea Company, and thirded by Mr. Freeman, who suggested, That it would be more advantageous to mulct the late Directors in a round sum of money, to be levied among themselves, than to confiscate their estates; and put them in the hands of trustees:that by the former method, 12 or 1500, OOP/.1 might be raised by the lamp, which was more than could be got the other way, and with less trouble and charge. But the House not seaming to relish the motion; it

1721 — iWr. Grey Neville's Speech [S4S

was dropt, and agreed to consider the report immediately.

The House hereupon began with the preamble of the Bill, in relation to which two points were strenuously debated: The first, was, that the words seven millions and upwards/ should be altered into these words, an im-- ‘ mense surawhich was moved by Mr. Robert Walpole, andsuppoited by the chancellor of the dutchy, and Mr. liungerford; but being opposed by sir Joseph Jekyll, and some other members, it was carried without dividing, that the words seven millions and upwards* should stand.

The next point was in relation to Mr. Aislabie, who in the preamble of the Bill is charged with breach of the great trust to him reposed, and that with’ a view to his own exorbitant-profit, he had combined With the late Directors of the South-Sea Company, in their pernicious practices, and had been guilty of most dangerous and infamous corruptions, &c. with other allegations that' are made the ground of his panishraent, to the enacting part. . j&r. Giles Earl moved, that these hard epithets might either be left out, or at least softened; Urging, among other reasons, that the. same would leave an indelible blot upon his son, a worthy gentleman, andamember of that House, and his family, to whom the House had thought fit to allow a considerable estate.

Mr. Grey Neville spoke yet more at large in favour of Mr. Aislabie as follows:

“ Sir, the charge in the bill before us against the honourable person who is the subject of this debate, consists of these two. articles-: Breach of Trust and Corruption. The breach of trust is grounded upon the 8th, 9th, and 10th resolutions of this House, upon which the bill was ordered to be brought in. These articles contain the several accusations of his having been privy to the loan of the Exchequer bills upon stock; his advising or approving the first money subscription at 3,000l. per cent, his encouraging the third money subscription by sending to a list.

“ I shall not enter into any dispute, whether these facts can be proved or not; but taking them for granted, I am extremely at a loss to find’any breach of trust in the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for having had any share in those matters.

“ Does the act of parliament direct the treasury to take care in what manner the Company employed the Exchequer bills ? There is not one word in the act relating to it. Does the act direct the treasury to take care what subscription the Company took in, and at what rates? If the act bad reposed such a trust in the treasury, this honourable person, and every other officer in it, would have been highly to blame, if they had not kept a watchful eye Upon the Company in these transactions: But if the act leaves these matters entirely to the management of the Company, whose concern done it was; where can the breach of trust be in the treasury f The Directors and the Coot-

pany acted under the authority of an act of parliament; has any body ever heard, that a chancellor of the exchequer, or the lords of the treasury, or a lord-high-treasurer, bad power to controul or dispense with, or give directions contrary to an act of parliament ?

“ If any body had a power to controul them, we had, and we alone, I mean the whole parliament then sitting: The Exchequer bills were issued and lent by the Company, and the first and second subscriptions taken in, long before the House rose: We saw what they were

doing, did we find fault with it? No, quite contrary: we approved of the two first subscriptions by another act of parliament, even in the same sessions; and is this honourable person now to be punished in a most severe manner for what the Directors did, by virtue of a law of our making, and confirmed by another law after those matters were over; if there Was any breach of trust aoy where, it was certainly in us, who alone had the power of putting a stop to any pernicious practices of the Directors, whilst we ourselves were sitting.

* But, Sir, we were not to blame for not having obstructed what they did at that time, nor was the treasury to blame, or were the Di-tectors themselves to blame, or guilty of any breach of trust on these accounts; the taking in subscriptions and the raising their stock, was lawful in itself, and absolutely necessary to execute the scheme, from which the public was to reap so great advantage: But the breach of trust, the pernicious practices from whence all these calamities have flowed, were the making use of the many millions of money that they had got, only to raise their stock to an imaginary height, by lending it out to gamesters and favourites, and even without any reasonable security at all. They who advised and tncouraged these practices, have been the Directors in their own wrong, and to the manifest Wrong of many thousands of families. But upon this head this honourable person is not accused by any body whatever.

“ The second accusation in this bill brought against him, is the charge of Corruption, which is grounded upon th£ resolution that declares*' Mr. Knight held 20,000l. South Sea Stock for this honourable person, whilst this bill was depending, without any money paid, or security given for the same. As for this article, I must own I am under great concern for the dignity of this House; it is certain that the zeal which has been shewn to do justice upon offenders, and to relieve unhappy sufferers, is very commendable:but whether that zeal has not carried us something too far in this matter, I confess I very much fear: It is not to be expected, that when this honourable person made his defence, what he said in his own justification could be perfectly understood, especially on this bead, it being the result of levers if accounts, ' which very few people can carry along with them in a debate: I must own I was not capable of doing it. and I could not

Vol. VII.

help being extremely surprised to find, when that matter came to be staled in the votes, that by those very resolutions upon which this honourable person was condemned, his innocence of this crime is as clear as it is possible to make it. This I believe every one, though ever so prejudiced, must be satisfied of, that takes but the pains of considering two or three of the resolutions together.

By the first Resolution we declare, Mr. Knight bought in December 1719, 22,000l. South Sea Stock for this honourable person, who paid him, as appears by the same account, 27, 800Z. for it.

“ By the third Resolution we declare, Mr. Knight, in February 1719, by the hand of Surman, and the broker, sold 20,000l. of the same South Sea Stock at ISO/, per cent, for the use and benefit of Mr. Aislabie; so that then Mr. Knight had 26,000l. of Mr. Aislabie's money in his hands, and likewise the remaining 2,000l. South Sea Stock, mentioned in the first resolution, which at 175, the then market-price, was worth 3, 500/. both sums together making 29, 500/. which sum was certainly a sufficient security for the 35,000l. paid by Mr. Knight on the 4th of March following, for the 20,000l. South Sea Stock, remaining in his bands, till the honourable person paid him tha rest of the money, about 6,000l.

“ There could not possibly be' any accident by fall of the stock, that could render this a bad security. But it is very well known, that this was not all that tbo honourable person proved, Mr. Knight had in his hands, at the time he paid for This 20,000l. South Sea Stock. Mr. Surman proved at the bar of the House, that Mr. Knight had 10,000l. East India Stock belonging to the honourable person at that time, which Weymondsold proved he bought for him, 9,000l. of which Mr. Surman sold on the 9th of March for 18, 900/. the whole at that time, being worth 21,000l. But, Sir, I have for my information stated all these matters together in a regular manner, and I will beg leave to read it to you, gentlemen, that if I am mistaken in any point, I may be set right.

uBy this Account it appears, Sir, as plain as figures can .make it, that Mr. Knight paid for this stock with this gentleman's money, and had at that time, or in a few days alter, a balance over and above in his hands, due to the hon. person, above 15,000l.

“ But, Sir, there is still another evidence upon our votes, which is stronger, if, possible, than this, and which convinced me more that this stock was bought with this gentleman's own money; and that he alone was to run all the hazard relating to it, than any living evidence whatever that could be given about it: I mean the'letter by which the hon. person ordered Mr. Weymondsold to buy this stock for jbim; which order is mentioned in out* fourth .resolution, and the letter itself is upon your table: This letter was undoubtedly writ before this inquiry could be thought of; this letter was writ by a great officer to a common ' broker. At that time, certainly there could be no-occasion of any art or management betwixt these two persons on this account. If any thing can give us the clearest light into this transaction, it roust be this letter: Give me leave to read it.

* Sir; I received yours, and did not write to Mr. Knight as you fancied, but left it all to

* you; if you can make it up 20,000l. I would ‘ stop there, since it has risen upon us so fast.

(I am yooes, J. A. March 1, 1719. P. S.

* I will desire Mr. Knight to pay you the

* money. '

“ By this evidence produced by the Secret .Committee against the hon. person, it plainly appears to be his stock; and by this letter he |s bid under an obligation to accept and pay for it, whether it had risen or fallen; and this is law, and this is practice. In the next place, .it proves it to be the gentleman's own money, and not the Company’s; because he restrains the broker from.buying more, because thestock lose so fast, which is not a reason to be given, if the Company had been to run the risque, and not the hon. gent, but the contrary. But what is mere convincing that it was not done In concert with Mr, Knight, is, that the hon.

person says, He did not write to Knight, as he fancied, but left it all to Weymondsold.

“ Thus, Sir, it is plain, that unless we unvote what we voted, item. . in pur first resolution, and what we voted in the third resolution, and unless we disprove this letter just mentioned, and unless Mr. Surinan were in the castle of Antwerp, it will be impossible for us to go about to make good this charge of corruption against the hon. person; but every account, every circumstance, every evidence we shall produce against him, wiU be very strongly for him. . '

“ Therefore, I hope, gentlemen will consider what they are going to do. "I am satisfied, in the present temper people are, every step we shall take towards the relief of the unhappy sufferers, will be applauded by thousands and ten. thousands; but m a little time the fury will certainly abate, when we have done all we can for them, and, perhaps, that all not satisfy many.

“ It behoves us to carry our views forward, and to consider how we shall look our country in the face if we cannot justify our actions, when they shall come to be considered calmly. And who, indeed, will be able to justify the destroying a gentleman's reputation, and tearing his estate from him, and putting him under the most cruel torture, the severest penalties and incapacities, not only without evidence of the crimes laid to his charge, but contrary lo the strongest evidence of his innocence.

“ Are we to take away a man’s reputation and estate for a breach of trust in matters that were not in any manner committed to his care; for confederating with people who all deny they ever communicated their counsels or measures to him in any of their unwarrantable practices ? For corruption, when by our own state of the case there is no appearance of corruption in that transaction, but quite the contrary ?

“ This would not be punishment, but cruelty; it would not be restitution, but, in my opinion, downright robbery. This would be an act of violence and tyranny unheard of in any British parliament. And as the thing itself is unheard-of and unprecedented, so is the manner of coming at it. Whoever heard of a bill of attainder (enacting all the punishments that can be inflicted except loss of life and limb) tacked to another bill ? Neither is it .a single tack, but a chain of bills linked together, of the condemned and accused, of the dead and the living: but I will confine myself to the person whose case is now in question; and pray let us see how that case stands.

“ First, a bill is ordered to be brought iu against that hon. person, to prevent him from going out of the kingdom and alienating his estate, that both his person and. his fortune may be liable to parliamentary justice, if lie should be found guilty of the crimes laid to his charge. This bill is read twice, and then ordered; to be committed: upon the motion, for commitment, some gentlemen are apprehensive, that dap

t$5S] PARL. HISTORY, 7 George I.

l»ill, singly "by itself, may chance not to pass the House of Lords:to prevent any such accident, - the Committee is directed to consolidate this bill (which as I have already said, is a bill in order to bring a man to trial) with a bill to punish thirty-five persons already convicted of great offences, by two several acts of parliament.

“ Is this all ? No. As some gentlemen were jealous that the Lords would not pass this bill singly, which was to make the hon. person to discover his estate; other gentlemen 'were as doubtful whether matters might not take such a turn, and circumstances he so much altered, that in another session the Lords might tie as unwilling to take his estate away -when discovered; and therefore as nothing is like the present time for doing of business, and all delays are dangerous in things of this nature, by another instruction to the said. Committee, the hon. person's estate is to be confiscated; and lest it should meet with great difficulties elsewhere, as has been already observed, this punishment is to be tacked to the former punishment, which was before tacked io the bill against the directors.

“ Any body would imagine that here certainly would be an end; but, no. Why, what nan be done next ? What, is he to be hanged ? Indeed hanging would have been a very safe way of wooing, and would have effectually

Krevested this gentleman, who is known to avesome talents, from making use of them at any time hereafter against thosp, who he may imagine have dealt very hardly by him; but something else is proposed that answers just the same purpose, and that is, a disability in the hon.' person from receiving any favour from the crown, and from sitting or voting in either House of Parliament This severe, this dangerous punishment, for the reasons above-mentioned, is likewise tacked to the last mentioned punishment, which was tacked to a former punishment, and so on.

. u Was any thing like this ever heard of in ~anj age before ? was ever any Englishman used in suc)i a manner ? a gentleman is locked up in a prison, at a great distance from his friends, at a great distance from the knowledge of what •passes in this House, comparatively to what it would be if he had his liberty: and here are we taking away his reputation, taking awayhis estate, putting him under cruel and ignominious incapacities, not by the summary way of a bill, but by a new invented and more summary way, by a clause incorporated into another hill in a ‘.Committee.

“ Is this onr boasted liberty ? is this our happy constitution, that is such a harrier to -our lives ami properties ? — No, Sir, this is not - the constitution of parliament; this is what •our ancestors never heard of: the several

forms that all hills ought to pass through, have been wisely provided, to give time and opportunity for application on one side, and consideration on the other; and without these ’'forms, a man may be hurried out of his life,

1721. — in favour of Mr. Aislabic.

his liberty, or his estate, in as tyrannical a manner as under the government of Pet^r Alexowitz.

“ When leave is given to offer a clause, nobody can tell exactly what that clause will he, till it is in the Committee: and before tl\e person that is to suffer by it can he fully apprized of it, the clause is passed, and there is no opportunity of opposing it, but upon the re-

fort, or at the third reading ’/ and every body nows how difficult the one is, and how vain the other:all the unfortunate person's friends can do, is only, like Job’s messengers, to acquaint him from time to time with some fresh calamity that has befallen him.

“ Sir, I freely declare, I value our constitution above all things on earth; and, I think, those rebels that fought at Dunblain and Preston to destroy it, and who, by setting a popish higotted tyrant upon the throne, would have deprived us of our religion and liberties, as well as our estates, greater criminals than those who used indirect arts last summer to get our money from us: nay, I think them greater criminals than even those guardians of orphans and infants who flung their wards into the stocks, when they themselves sold out at excessive high prices; and by leaving those unhappy wretches in that gulph of perdition, made a golden bridge for themselves to escape upon. Obliging these hypocrites to make restitution to those most unhappy sufferers, would be a piece of the highest justice, both in the sight of God and man. But my just concern for those miserable creature^ has carried me a little from my subject.

* When I sayt Sir, that* I value our constitution so highly, it is because of its being se strong a fortress against all the sudden irruptions of arbitrary, power in every shape: it consists in this, that no man can suffer loss of life, or limb, or reputation, or liberty, or estate, but upon a fair trial, and by the judgment of his peers in nil common cases; and in the most extraordinary cases, where the legislature interposes, the trial is to be by a bill; in such a case, leave must be first given to bring in that bill; then it must he read a first, and then a second rime, afterwards committed, then reported, and read a third time; after which, it goes through all the same forms in the House of Lords, where a man has all the same opportunities of making his defence *, and their lordships have as free a liberty of judging, as the Commons had before.

“ In the last place, it comes to the royal assent, and there is room for application for mercy, and the bill may be, after all, rejected.

' “ But, Sir, if instead of all these checks upon the sudden resolutions of the judges, and all these opportunities of defence of the person accused, a man may be destroyed at once, by a clause offered in a Committee, and(tacked to a money bill, or any other bill of a more popular kind, .which the whole nation may expect should pass, and consequently both the Lords and the «rowa be deprived of their freft

judgment; and by that means be struck out of the legislature, I do not see bow our constitu* tion can be more effectually subverted. This would be tearing up parliaments by the roots, and destroying, at one blow, all that our ancestors and we have been so long struggling to preserve. An act of this nature would be a greater iniquity than any of the directors did or could commit, and would obliterate their offences, by conveying down to posterity greater crimes than they were ever guilty of.

“ I hope, Sir, we shall not do them such a service at our own expence, and therefore I am for leaving the hon. person out of this bill, and for going on against him, as we at first set out, in just fair parliamentary way, to the end, that if he has been guilty of any faults, he may be punished for them; but I am not for punishing him for other persons' faults, much less am I for punishing him in such a monstrous, in such a violent manner, as will declare to all the world, that we could not make good our charge against him, but yet were resolved to sacrifice him, and even the constitution itself with him/ '

Mr. Neville was answered by sir Joseph Jekyll, Mr. Spencer Cowper and Mr. Freeman, who insisted, that though the facts mentioned in the preamble could not be legally proved, yet the House being satisfied in -their consciences of the truth of those facts, from the evidence that bad appeared before them, the same was sufficient for that House. Sir Joseph having spoke with some vehemence upon that head, Mr. Neville made some smart reflections upon him:but though Mr. Robert Walpole and Mr. Lechmere spoke likewise in behalf of Mr. ALlabie, yet were they not able to stem the tide which run so strong against him, that it was carried without dividing, to let the words in the preamble, relating to him, continue.

Debate in the Commons concerning the forfeited, Estates of the South Sea Directors."] Juue 28. The House went through all the Schedules of the Estates of the late Sub-Governor, Deputy-Governor, Directors, &c. of the South-Sea Company, and agreed with the Committee, as to the allowances given them, (See p.834) except Mr. Astell’s, to whom they gave 10,000l. sir Lambert Blackwell, who had 15,000l. sir John Blunt, who got 5,000l. and Mr. Hawes 5,000l. It was moved to reduce sir Theodore Janssen's allowance to 30,000l. but upon a division, it was carried in the negative by a great majority.

Then a Clause was offered byjcolonel Earle to be added to the Bill, in favour of Mr. Ais-labie, viz. for excepting from the forfeiture, his country bouse, gardens, £i)d park, as also his lady’s jewels and houshold goods; which was brought up and read, and a debate arising' thereupon, the same was adjourned to the next day, when if was agreed to without any division.

This being over, the remainder of the sitting

was spent in a debate of near three hours upon the question. Whether as the Bill stood, to vest the forfeited Estates in trustees, or to mulct the late Directors and others, at a certain sum? A clause for the Mulct was offered by Mr. Hutcheson, who proposed a million and half sterling, sir Thomas Cross moved for 1, 400,000l. but. not agreeing upon the sum, the debate was adjourned to the 3d of Juiy.

July 3. The House resumed the adjourned debate upon the Clause offered to be added to the Sufferers' Bill, viz. That the Estate of which the late Mr. Craggs, sen. was possessed in Oct. 1719, be vested in the hands of the trustees appointed by this Bill to dispose of the estates of the late Directors; which being strenuously opposed by the court party, was upon a division carried in the negative, by 10, 4 voices against 90.

Then sir John Eyles, bart. proposed that clause for vesting the estates of the forfeiting persons in themselves, and only laying a mulct upon them, might he read, which being done accordingly, sir Thomas Cross spoke to it, and suggested, “ That it were more advantageous to the public, either to mulct the Directors, or to allow them 15 per cent, out of their estates for prompt payment, ” but this being warmly opposed by Mr. Jessnp, Mr. Milner, sir Nathaniel Gould, and lord Molesworth, the motion for reading the said clause a second time was rejected without a division.

The South Sea Sufferers' Bill passes the Com-

mons.] July 6. The engrossed Suiferers' Bill was read a third time ifcith a new title, viz. A Bill, for taising mom y upon the F.states of the late Sub-Governor, Deputy Governor, 4 Directors, &c.’ which, with other amendments, was passed and sent up to the Tords by Mr. Clayton. It is observable, that after the third reading over the whole Bill, which took up above two hours, Mr. Milner proposed a rider to be added to it, importing, That the houshold goods, plate, linen, &c. of the Directors, might be excepted out of the Bill; but this motion was rejected with disdain.

The King’s Message relating to the Civil Debts.] July 11. Mr. Methuen acquainted the Commons, that he had a Message signed by his majesty, which was read by Mr. Speaker as follows:

“ G. R.

“ His majesty finds it necessary to acquaint his loyal House of Commons with the difficulties he labours under, by reason of Debts contracted in his civil government, which being computed to Lady-day last, do amount to more than 550,000l.

“ If the provision, made by an act of the last session of parliament, for discharging this Debt, had not hitherto proved in a very great degree ineffectual, his majesty had not been under a necessity of applying again to parliament upon this occasion; but being resolved to cause a retrenchment to be made of his Civil last expences for the future, and finding that

657] PARL. HIST. 7 Georcb I. 1721 — Debate thereon. [85S

such a retrenchment cannot well be effected, without discharging the present arrears, has ordered the Accounts thereof to be laid before the House, and hopes he may be impowered to raise ready money for tjbat purpose, on the Civil List revenues; which, to avoid the laying any new burden on his people, his majesty proposes shall be replaced to the Civil List, and reimbursed, by a deduction to be made out of the Salaries and Wages of all offices, and the pensions, and other payments, from the crown.”

Debate in the Commont .] After the

reading of this Message,

Mr. Shippen stood up, and took notice of this new and unusual method of asking for money, not from the throne, and, at the beginning of a session, as it had always been the custom in former reigns: hut now, by a message, towards thp end of the session, when most of the members were gone home: look round about the Home, gentlemen, said he, and see how few members are present, when a business of this consequence is to be debated. But besides the unseasonahkness of the time, Mr. Shippen observed, That this Message was no less extraordinary as to another circumstance, for whereas the Ways and Means of raising supplies were always left to the Commons; here not only the sum, but the way of raising it, w as pointed out to them, which was making the House a perfect parliament of Paris. That if things were brought to that pass, it might be easy for any king, whenever he thought lit. to make himself arbitrary, and absolute master of pur liberties and properties: concluding, he was sure, that the gentleman, who had advised the asking for such a sum, in that manner, (meaning Mr. Kobert Walpole) would have been of a quite contrary mind four years ago; but that it was usual lor men’s judgments to alter as their interests lead them. — But Mr. Shippen not being seconded, it was resolved to take the King’s Message into cons idem t ion the next day, in a committee of the whole House.

July 12. The Commons, in a grand Committee, took the said Account and Message into consideration; and Mr. Shippen having jipoke much to the same purpose, as he did the day before, was answered by

Mr. Robert Walpole, who shewed the o«»-casion, and reasonablenessofthe king’s Message, the tenderness and regard hi' majesty expressed in it for the ease of his subjects, and the necessity o%f complying with his majesty’s gracious desires and intentions. He was seconded by

Mr. Lowndes, who said, That six-pence in

the pound on all the Civil List Funds, would •nswer the purpose; but Mr. Pulteney, and air Joseph Jekyll, were of opinion that it would »ot do, and therefore they moved for one shilling in the pound; adding, That if this were too much for the present occasion, the overfills might go towards the discharge of the Public Debts.

v, Ut. Sloper, upon this last consideration,

moved for one shilling and six-pence id the pound, and that the tax might extend to all military officers, whose pay was above tea shillings a day.

This being opposed by Mr. R. Walpole, Mr. Sloper answered him, and Mr. Lowndes replied to Mr. Sloper, whose motion was backed Dy Mr. Arthur Moore, and Mr. Herne: bu^ Mr. Walpole, and Mr. JLiwndes, having again replied, Mr. Sloper’s motion was dropt.

Then the’ question was put, whether one shilling, or six-pence in the pound be laid on all payments out of the Civil List; and it was carried for one shilling, by one voice only, viz. Ill votes against 110. After this the main question was put, That one shilling in the pound be given on all payments out of the Civil List; towards a fund for paying the interest of 500,000l. and for sinking part of the National Debts, which was carried by 153 voices against 63.

July 14. Mr. Farrer reported the Resolution of the said Committee. Upon which Mr. Lowndes moved, That the House do not agree with the Committee in the said Resolution, and that the said tax be altered to sixpence in the pound Hereupon

Mr. Hungerford took notice, That this tax was inconsistent with the resolution taken this session for a land tax, importing, That three shillings in the pound, and no more, be laid on all lands, salaries, pensions, &c. That there was, indeed, an instance of such a tax in the late queen’s reign, when 500,000l. were raised much in the same manner, lor the Civil Lists but that this was then called Robinisni, (the earl of Oxford’s name, who was then prime minister, being Robert) and he feared this would bear the same name.

Mr. Treby answered Mr. Hungerford, at Mr. Clayton did Mr. Treby, who was answered by Mr. Henry Pelham, and the latter by lord Sianbope. Hereupon

Mr. Robert Walpole answered most of the objections that had beeu offered on the opposing side. But

Mr. Pulteney observed, That he had not always beeu of the opinion he now seemed to be of; that his mind altered as be was in or out of place: and as he might be out in a twelve-month’s time, so he might then be of another opinion. T«» this

Mr. R. Walpole, replied, That it was possible, indeed, he might be out again: but whenever that happent d, he should be glad to resiga to a person of so much merit as Mr. Pulteney. The latter returned the compliment; after which, sir Joseph Jekyll spoke for the motion of one shilling in the pound; but the question being put thereupon, it was carried in the uegntive, -by a majority of 132 voices against 8$.

And then it was resolved, without dividing. That his majesty be enabled to raise any sum not exceeding >500,000l. to discharge the arrears and debts upon the Civil List, by causing a deduction not exceeding sixpence in the pound, to 6e made oat of salaries, wage *

pensions or other payments from the crown. And a Bill was ordered to be brought in accordingly; which Bill was passed on the 21st and sent up to the Lords.

Debate in the Lords on the South Sea Sufferers Relief Bill.] July 10. A Bill from the Commons, For raising money upon the

* Estates of the late Sub-Governor, Deputy- Governor, and Directors of the South Sea 4 Company, ’ was rend a first time and ordered a second reading; after which a Petition of John Aislabie, esq. was presented to the House, praying to be heard.by his counsel; but the receiving of it was' vehemently opposed by the lord Townshend, who said, 44 He had done more mischief than any man in the nation.” Some other lords spoke more favourably of Mr. Aislabie, particularly the earl of Sunderland, though not directly, and so rite Petition was received, and ordered to lie on the table.,

Then the earl of Clarendon presented two Petitions of sir John Fellows and .Mr. Joye, Upon which arose a debate on the question, Whether any Petitions from the Directors should be received ? The earl of Sunderland suggested, that if they were all to be heard to every particular, they should sit till next year: but though the lords Trevor, North and Grey, and Bathurst, urged, That there was as much reason for receiving these Petitions as Mr. Aislabie’s, yet upon the question, they were both rejected without dividing. Then there was another Petition presented in behalf of the late Mr. Craggs’s daughters, which, after a •hort debate, was received, and ordered to lie on the table.

> A Conference between both Hovsesf relating to Mr. Aislabie and the late Mr. sen.] July 12. The Lords sent a Message to the Commons, to desire a present Conference in the Painted Chamber, upon the subject matter of the Bill to raise Money upon the

* Estates of the late Directors, ’ &c. which being readily agreed to, and the managers on both sides rnet, the lord Carleton, from those of the Lords signified to those of the Commons, 44 That their lordships had commanded them to acquaint the House of Commons, that they had received the Bill before-mentioned from them, and found iu it a charge against John Aislabie, esq. and the late James Craggs, sen. esq. and though they hod read the Bill twice, yet their lordships could not find in it the Reasons that induced the Commons to insert their names, in the said Bill, and therefore desired this Conference, to know the matters of fact upon which the said Bill was grounded, so far as the same. related to Mr. Aislabie and Mr. Craggs.”

Mr. Sloper having reported to the House of Commons the said Conference, they resolved, That such Members as were of the'Committee of Secrecy, be appointed a Committee to state the Matters of Fact, on which those parts of tbt Bill for Relief of the Sooth Son Company

were grounded, relating to Mr. Aislabie, and the late Mr. Craggs.

The Commons’ Reasons for punishing Mr.

Aislabie.] July 14. Mr.- Clayton; from the said Committee, delivered to the Lords at a Conference, the Commons’ Reasons for inserting the name of Mr. Aislabie in the said BHI, as follows:

“ Your Lordships having desired at a Conference, that the Commons would acquaint your Lordships with the Mutters of Fact, upon which the Bill, intitled, 4 An Act for raising Money upon the Estates of the late Sub-Go- vernor, Deputy-Governor, Directors, Cashier, 4 Deputy-Cashier, and Accomptant of the Souih Sea Company, and of John Aislabie, 4 esq. and likewise of James Craggs, sen. esq. 4 deceased, towards making good the great loss and damage sustained by the said Company, and for disabling such of the said Persons as are living to hold any office or place of trust under the crown, or to sit or vote in parliament fur the future; and for other purposes in the said Act expressed, so far as the same relates to the said John Aislabie, and to the said James Craggs/ was grounded.

44 The Commoos have commanded us to acquaint your lordships, that the said Matters of Fact, so suggested in the said Bill, are relative to the Matter of Fact suggested in the former part of the preamble of me said Bill, and will be explained thereby; and for your lordships' farther satisfaction we are-commanded by the Commons t6 acquaint your lordships, that the Bill, so far as it relates to the said John Ais-iabie, besides the notoriety of facts, was grounded, as well upon proof, as the- confession of Mr. Aislabie.

44 As to the confession of Mr. Aislabie, we are commanded by the Commous to affirm in their names to your lordships, that Mr. Aislabie did in his place confess, that upon the 3rd and 19th days of December, 1719, 22,000l. South Sea Stock was brought by Mr. Robert Knight, late cashier of the South Sea Company, for him the said Mr. Aislabie; and Mr. Aislabie delivered in to the Commons a paper of the hand writing of Mr. Knight, containing part of an account in the words following.

“ We are also commanded to acquaint your lordships, that the Commons having received information, that Mr.. Francis Hawes, one of the late Directors of the Souih-Sea Company, had uegociated very large sums for Mr. AisU-bie, and had had dealings for a considerable time past in South-Sea Stock with the said Mr. Aislabie, and that an Account thereof was kept in a book, of which Mr. Aislabie had a duplicate; which accounts were continued in that book until some time in November last: the Commons did, on the 7th day of March last, order that the said book should be laid before them the next morning; at the making of which order Mr. Aislabie was present in his place, and did not object or offer any thing to the House that the same could not be complied with. But the next day Mr. Aislabie attending in his place to make his defence to the several matters objected to him, an obedience to that order being required, Mr. Aislabie declared, that Mr. Hawes, if called in, would tell the House, that Mr. Hawes, with his owu hand, committed the laid book to the fire; upon which Mr. Hawes being called m and examined, said. That the said book was, in the beginning of November last, upon Mr. Aislabie’s pressing instances, de-bverea up by him to Mr. Aislabie; and that the same book, and also the said duplicate thereof, kept by Mr. Aislabie, were both then burnt together, part by Mr. Aislabie, and part by himself, at Mr. Aislabie's instance, and that the proposal for burning them came from Mr. Aislabie; and Mr. Hawes farther said, that he had not any duplicate or entry of what was contained in the said book.

“ We are farther commanded to acquaint your lordships, that upon the 20th of January J719-20, the Commons resolved, That their House would, upon the 22nd of that month, resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, to consider of that part of his majesty’s Speech which related to the Public Debts, which the House did accordingly; and that afterwards, on the 27th of January, the House again resolved itself into the said Committee, and the committee did then receive Proposals from the South-Sea Company for paying the Public Debts.

“ As for proof, the several persons following, viz. Mr. Robert Surman, Mr. Francis Hawes, Mr. Matthew Weymonsold, Thomas Weddall, esq. sir Theodore Janssen, sir Lambert Blackwell, Mr. Webster, Mr. Robert Knight, sir John Fellows, sir John Blunt, Mr. John Faulcon-bridge, Edmond Waller, esq. Mr. Edward Gibbon, and Mr. Charles Joye were examined, and did, in the opinion of the Commons, make out the allegations in the said Bill relating to Mr. Aislabie.”

As to the late Mr. Craggs, the managers of the Commons acquainted those of the Lords, “ That the Commons bad positive Evidence, that great quantities of South-Sea Stock were taken in for him, without his paying for it, or giving sufficient security.”

. Furthtr Proetisding* tkc JLords

Mr. Aislabie, Sfc.] Lord Carleton having reported this Conference to the House, the Lords ordered it to be taken into consideration the next day, which being done accordingly, their lordships, after some debate, made the following orders, viz. — 1. “ That John Aislabie, esq. beheard at the bar of the House on Tuesday next, if be thinks fit, — 2. That the lieutenant of the Tower do bring Mr. Aislabie to the bar of the House on Tuesday. — 3. That the Serjeant at Arms attending the House of Commons, do bring up sir John Blunt at the same time to be examined as a witness. — 4. That a Message be sent to the Commons to desire they would give leave that any of the witnesses, that are members of that House, may be examined in behalf of Mr. Aislabie. — 5. That the other witnesses *that are not members of the House of Commons as also, — 6. That Edmond W alter, esq. do then attend to he examined.”

Then the Petitions of the Executors of the late Mr. Craggs being read, it was ordered, That the said Petitions be>eferred to the Committee upon that Bill, and that they be then severally heard by their counsel.

Then a Petition of Mr. Robert Surman, late Deputy-Cashier of the South-Sea Company, was read, and rejected:after which it was ordered, That an Address he presented to his majesty, praying, That the several Papers relating to the affair of Mr. Aislabie, may belaid before the House.

July 18. The Lords went into a Committee upon the Directors Bill, and great debates arose in relation to Mr. Aislabie, how, and in what manner he and his witnesses should be, examined ?

The Lord Harcourtmoved, That according

to the established rules of justice and equity, every one of them might be examined distinctly to every article:but this was warmly opposed by

Lord Townshend, who alledged, That such

a method would take up so much time, that it might endanger the loss of the bill, which was of the greatest importance, not only to the kingdom, but to the king himself; for if the bill should miscarry, no than could tell what might be the consequence. This was supported by

The Earl of Sunderland, who likewise urged the necessity of passing this bill, to quiet the minds of the people.

Then Mr. Aislabie was called in, and, at his desire, Mr. Weddal, Mr. Surman, sir Lambert Blackwell, sir John Blunt, sir Theodore Janssen, Mr. Faulconbridge, Mr. Joye, and Mr. Hawes were severally called in, examined, and confronted with him. Sir John Fellows declared he knew nothing of the questions that were put to him by Mr. Aislabie; and sir John Blunt being asked who was the contriver of the South-Sea Scheme f Answered, - it was none of hit contriving, but the House of Comtnous: bqt sir Theodore Janssen being examined about the same matter, said, < That he always took

663] . PARL. HISTORY, 7 George I. 1721. — Mr. Aislabie*s Defence [804

»ir John Blunt to be the contriver, as certainly he was the chief manager of the South-Sea Scheme; and that, for his own part, he never was let into the secret of that affair/ Mr.

. Hawes being examined as to the burning of the Books of Accounts, ingeniously owned the fact; but said they were only books of private accounts between Mr. Aislabie and himself;

; and which no wise concerned the public, or any other private person, besides them two:

Upon which, Mr. Aislabie said, He thought there was no Hurt in burning accounts that were made up and cancelled, and in which no body had any concern, but Mr. Hawes and himself.

These Examinations being over,

Lord Onsloa/ stood up and asked, Whether, in the opinion of their lordships, any mischief had happened to the public? And being an- swered by another lord, Yes, without doubt, *a great deal:*' but, added lord Onslow; it seems nobody has done it; sir John Blunt is innocent, sir John Fellows knows nothing of the matter, none of the Directors were let into the secret, Mr. Aislabie has done no hurt: therefore, my lords, I move to adjourn; which was done accordingly.

July 19. The Lords went again into a committee upon that part of the Directors Bill relating to Mr. Aislabie; and

The Lord Trevor said, “ That from any evidence that had yet appeared before them, he Could not see that there was sufficient ground to insert Mr. Aislabie’s name in the Bill, and to involve him in the same punishment jvith the Directors; and therefore, before they proceeded farther, he thought it necessary to send to the Secret Committee, to lay before them their whole evidence/

This motion was seconded by lord Harcourt; but the same, if carried, being like to embroil both Houses in dangerous disputes, the lord Falmouth moved for adjourning during pleasure, which was agreed to. After a short adjournment, their lordships agreed to call in and examine Mr. Surman and Mr. Weymonsold, the former of whom deposed, and the other confirmed, that Mr. Aislabie had South-Sea Stock transferred to him several times, to the value of above 30,000l. for which .they knew dot that he ever paid any thing; Then

would have indulged me so far, to have heard me by my counsel in the usual manner, in a case where ray property, my liberty, and, for ought I know, my life, may be concerned.

“ I must own, my lords, I come very ill prepared to make my Defence against such parts of this long and perplexed Bill as seem to relate to me: it hath received so many alterations in the tedious passage it made through the other House, that it was impossible to learn how far I was affected by it, till it was past; and it hath made iso quick a progress in this House, that I have scarce been able to get a copy of it, before I am brought before your lordships to make my Defence against it.

“ It was some surprize to mte, my lords, after what had passed in the House of Commons, and after a Bill had been ordered, and was brought in, to make me discover my effects, and to re* strain me from going out of the kingdom; I say it was some surprize to me to find myself translated all on a sudden into this Bill against the Directors, under the new-fashioned term of Consolidation, without any new offence given, or cause assigned, that is fit to be mentioned in this place. However, my lords, I now find my* self tacked to them and their unhappy fate.

“ My lords, it concerns me much to know the cause of this extraordinary proceeding, the reasons of these cruel and new-invented punishments, and the facts that are to make out the crimes alledged against me in the preamble of this Bill. 1 have carefully perused and examined it, and enquired into all the steps it has taken since I was heard in my place in the House of Commons against a charge contained in the Report of the Secret Committee, and I find nothing but what is new and extraordinary throughout the whole. I was heard, my lords, I Bay, upon the Report of the Secret Committee, containing man^ loose and uncertain facts as to me, and, as it seems, innocent, or ineffectual to any one besides. I thought I had given entire satisfaction to that assembly of my innocence; when I found it was the pleasure of the House that I should withdraw before any question was moved, or stated upon paper, as is usual; it was impossible therefore to know my crimes, or the facts upon which they were grounded, so as to be able to make a proper Defence there before I withdrew, though I had been very well prepared to do it, as I think I was.

“ But, my lords, as this never happened to any Commoner before; so, my lords, in the warrant by which I was committed to the Tower, I find no Cause assigned for my commitment/ as has always been practised in the like cases.

“ Thus far, my lords, I was at a loss even for my crimes; but the next day the votes of ibe House of Commons presented me with a view of many extraordinary crimes contained in several resolutions: crimes which my soul abhors, and of which, my lords, I do in this place, and at this Bar, declare I am entirely innocent. I saw in the same votes an order for a Bill to be brought in, to enquire into my estate, &c. I

Mr. Aislabie’s Defence at the Bar of the House of Lohds.] Mr. Aislabie was call- ed in, and ordered to make his Defence, which he did in the following Speech;

u My Lords:

u I appear at your lordships bar, by your permission, to be heard, in my own person-, against that part of the Bill now depending before your lordships, which affects myself. I have been long confined, by order of the House of Commons, under whose displeasure I am unhappily fallen, for want, perhaps, of proper falente to explain and support my own innocence j for which reason, I wish your lordships 8

* 65] PAUL. HISTORY, 7 G*or« *

1 perceived that Bill to make a slow progress for some time, till from some fresh displeasure conceived against me, it changed its shape at once, and became a Bill of punishment, and not of enquiry, or at least of inquiry as in cases of felons convict, though I had never had any trial. Tfiis way of dealing with an English subject, is unknown to the laws of England; I say, my lords, fir$t to punish, and then inquire, the law abhors. t

“ However, my lords, I thought myself sure of the eleven Resolptions contained in the Votes of the House of Commons, as the ground of the Charge against me; Resolutions that have been sent abroad, and have made me the object of. public odium throughout the kingdom. I had prepared myself to answer to this charge upon every Article. But here, my lords, I found myself again disappointed; and these very Articles for which I had been branded, expelled, and committed to the Tower for so many months, disappeared at once, and were (if fame be not a liar) rejected by one of the very persons that moved them, as so mpny loopholes through which an innocent man might escape.

* So here, my lords, I am at a loss again; the punishments are enacted, the most cruel torturing punishments, before any charge is made, or any facts alledged, and at last it is sent up to your lordships with a charge of crimes, without any facts at all to support that charge. Give me leave, my lords, to say, that this, above all the other extraordinary steps, is most new and unprecedented. An attainder, like this, without any legal charge in it, tacked to another Bill that must pass, is a complicated mischief:an attainder of itself is uncommon, and generally abhorred:an attainder tacked is entirely new and unparliamentary:an attainder without facts ascertained, is not only new and dangerous, but against the very principles of justice, !and the laws of the land m all cases. For this reason, my lords, I have humbly represented to you the difficulties I lie under in respect to my defence, from the uncertainty of my charge, for want of facts stated to _ support It, and without which it is properly no charge at all.

* Your lordships have thought fit? to desire, at a Conference with the Commons, to have this defect supplied; and they have accordingly delivered to your lordships a paper, a copy whereof you have been pleased to give me, in order to my Defence, which I therefore take leave to read to your lordships. [Here he read the Rea-soqs delivered by Mr. Clayton to the Lords at thd Conference. Sedp. 860.] My lords, upon perusal of this Paper, I find only two facts, mentioned, which, if proved, are no crimes, and of no relation to the preamble of the Bill. For as in the preamble there were crimes alledged without facts, so in this Paper there are facts without crimes: your, lordships upon this extraordinary occasion desired this Conference with the Commons, in order to he informed of the facts that were the ground of their charge. They have been pleased to refer your lordships

VouVIL

1721. — Mr. Aislabitfs [£6f

to that part of the preamble relating to the Directors, 'by which they say the charge against me is to be explained. I have examined this part of the preamble, and am entirely at a loss to find one fact stated in it; the whole is general and most uncertain, and amounts to no charge at all: that part of the preamble relating to me, is so far from being explained by it, that it is made more perplexed and uhintelHgi- '

“ My lords, it is a strange circumstance that attends my case: I stand here accused, and ready to make my Defence before your lordships my judges. Your lordships are at a loss to know upon what facts to try me; you have enquired of the Commons my accusers, and are no better informed; but on my part, my lords, it is yet more extraordinary; the accused is put under a necessity to find out facts to support the charge’of his accusers. Was any proceed^ ing like this ever known before ? No, my lords, the Bill of Attainder against my lord 'Strafford was extorted from the legislature by force and violence, and, in some respect, like this, under colour of appeasing the deluded people. Vain imagination ! This concession of your ancestors made way for all the miseries that followed. But cruel and unjust as it was, there were facts stated in that Bill to charge that noble lord, and his accusers came like men to this Bar to make them good; bnt where are my accusers, ovy lords ? Where are their facts? ‘And where is their evidence? Was there ever any accusation that proceeded from a Secret Committee before, that was not made good rit this Bar by those who are supposed to know the facts best, and who have obliged the public with their discoveries ? Why do they decline1 to give your lordships and the public this satisfaction ? My \ lords, I find, to save this trouble, they refer you to the notoriety of the facts: strange notoriety of fapts, that are not yet revealed, and to which there is no evidence! Was this expression ever used before at any Conference ? In any act of parliament? .Or did it ever approach this Bar before ? Pray, my lords, what does it mean ? If it means common fame or public clamour, thanks to the arts of my enemies, I have had my full share, 'and felt the cruel effects of it: but if fame is to be a guide injudicial proceedings, and in criminal cases, there is ho head safe; we are all in the power of whisperers and defamers. But has public fame ever been thought sufficient to conviction ? No, my lords* public fame has been said to be a ground Hi inquiry, but never of condemnation. 1$e Commons, in the case of the duke of Buckingham, Anno 1 Car. 1. did, at the instance of Dr. Turner *, declare, that common fame was a good grouud of enquiry or presentment; but as this was complained df by the crown as ap unparliamentary proceeding, the Commons, in their remonstrance a little ►time after, receded from this pretence, and affirmed their proceedings to be grounde4 upon their own knowledge, >

or proof, by the examination of witnesses, or other evidence; and in every Article of their accusation the particular facts are expressed. But this is not roy case, my lords; I see no facts charged upon me, I hear of none; it is in vain to make a Defence against nothing; *tis fighting with the air.

“ But since, my lords, the Commons have recommended some witnesses to your lordships, who, they say, did, in their opinion, moke out thee allegations in the Bill; pray let me examine what the allegations in the bill are, and how they were made out by the witnesses, who have been examined before your lordships.

- “ My lords, in that part of the preamble of the bHl which charges me, it is alledged, that John Aislabie, esq. late chancellor and under-treasurer of the exchequer, and one of the commissioners of his majesty’s treasury, and a member of the House of Commons, in breach of the great trust in him reposed, and with a view to his own exorbitant profit, has combined with the said directors of the South-Sea Company in their pernicious practices, and has been guilty of most dangerous and infamous corruptions, to the detriment of great numbers of his majesty’s subjects, and manifest prejudice of the public credit, and of the trade of this kingdom. ’

« My Lords, in considering this Charge I am at a loss to find in what capacity I am accused of Breach of Trust. The title of Chancellor of the Exchequer’ stands there, I suppose, or-namenti gratia; it is an office of great honour end dignity, bat has no relation to this affair, or to the execution of the South-Sea Scheme; nor is that officer so much as mentioned in any act of parliament since the first constitution of the Company; it is a distinct office {from the treasury, ana in some instances without much influence, though joined in commission with that board. — I must then stand accused as one of the commissioners of the treasury, or as a member of parliament, or both. — I flatter my-aelf, my lords, that 1 have acquitted myself in these two capacities with the same integrity and good faith as the rest of my brethren; nor can I understand how I could commit any one act in Breach of my Trust, as ope of the commissioners of the treasury, ' without the participation of at least two of the same board .

“ I have perused the acts of parliament relating to the execution of the South-Sea Scheme, and desire they may be read, that it may be aeen how far the treasury were concerned, or were intrusted with any part of the execution of the Scheme, that we may know wherein this trust consisted, and so have recourse to such facts as may charge me and others with a breach of it. My lords, I know of nothing that concerns the treasury in those acts, but what relates to the making forth and issuing the Exchequer-Bills to be lent to the Company, besides the constitution of commissioners relating to the taking in of the Public . Debts, which commission your lordships have affirmed* nodes tothose bills, my lords, no nan

!. 1721. — Afir. Aislabie*[%0

has accused me, not sir John Blunt himself; he tolls' you upon his examination here, as he told the other House before, that-he took it to' be the sense of the House of Commons, that the Company might lend out the Exchequer-Bills upon their stock, having been admitted to bear the debates of the House upon that occasion, and that they were therefore so lent out.

“ My Lords, there is not one word more in all those acts of parliament that implies any farther trust, nor is there any power given or reserved to the commissioners of the treasury, to direct or controul the directors, but what has been literally pursued by the treasury. Where then is this breach of trnst in me, as one of the commissioners of the treasury ? Is there any trust reposed in me in any capacity that makes me responsible to the South-Sea Company ? If not, how comes the chancellor of the exchequer, and one single commissioner of the treasury, to bejconfiscated for the use oi some of his fellow-subjects for breach of trust ? — If then this breach of trust is no where to be found, let us examine next, wherein I have combined with the late directors in their perr uicious practices. By the reference the. Com* mons make to the matters of fact suggested in the former part of the preamble of the bill relating to the directors, one might expect to find these practices set forth there, in order to make out the charge of which they stand accused.

“ My Lords, I have looked into this part of the preamble relating to them, and find it is only said, that they, the directors, under colour of the late act, have carried on many notorious, fraudulent, indirect practices, contrary1 to the intention of the said late act, not only to the immense loss of the Company, to seven millions and upwards, but the great detriment of the public, &c. But the particulars of these practices are no where specified: I have heard, indeed, they once stood part of this bill, but'were afterwards left out as so many incumbrances upon it; and if I may be allowed to take notice of what the Commons upon deliberations have supprest, I would acquaint your lordships, that that part of the preamble of the bill which relates to the pernicious practices of the late directors, as tending to the immense loss of the Company, to seven millions and upwards, was comprized in these words, viz.

‘ That the directors have been guilty of se»

* veral corruptions, breaches of trust, frauds,

* and abuses, by contriving the fictitious stock ‘ of 574, 500/. stock, and entering it in their ‘ books, to be sold for 1, 213, 575/.

* That they olso lent upon stock, or pretend-< ed stock, contrary to the resolutions of the

* court of directors, several suras amounting to 1 943, 631/. over and above the 500,000/T tp

* which the loans were restrained; and more, ‘ 400, 903/. over and above the sums limited to (be lent, ; and more, several sums beyond what ‘ they were-limited, which excesses amount hi ‘ the whole to 3, 746, 467/.

Here, my Lords, you have a plain account of all the directors’ pernicious practices; let it ' now be enquired, what evidence has been given to your lordships, to make out iny having combined with them in all, or any of those practices.

“ As to the first Article in relation to their contriving the fictitious stock of 574, 500/. and entering it in their books, to be sold 1, 313, 575/. there is not one word said by any of the directors, that I was privy to it, or that they ever heard, or inspected, or that there was even so much as, a whisper amongst them, that I had, or was to have any part of it; and jthp Secret Committee themselves, after having, in the most extraordinary, as well as the most solemn manner, examined them all to this fact, were pleased to say, there was no such eharge against me.

“ As this was the fund for all the corruption, and die source of all our misfortunes, I think myself extremely happy, let my fate bp what it wdl, that I stand clear and acquitted, in the judgment of my worst enemies, of this criminal and cursed transaction. And' as this was a work of darkness, that has not yet been perfectly brought to light, and as it was- in its nature such as carried the greatest secrecy and ^security with it; and as I am the person supposed to have been the author of the scheme, and the director of the directors, and one who commanded every thing, is it possible to imagine, that I should neglect to take my share of this mighty harvest, and trust to the secrecy of an infamous broker, and the hazard of an open market?

“ But notwithstanding the Secret Committee, who spared no pains in their inquiries relating to me, have not thought fit to charge me upon this bead, but have entirely acquitted me, I find some notice is taken of what Mr. Surman Las said concerning the Green Book, wherein be saw my name to an account that was balanced: whatever notice your lordships are pleased to take of that information* the gentlemen -of the Secret Committee knew Letter than to insist upon it in tLeir charge, since that account is said to be after the hill was past, and £o be balanced; and, consequently, I must have it to produce, unless by some extraordinary ac-cidestfOr artifice, I should have lost it. But as JMr, Surman has proved, that Knight kept my cash long befpfe the scheme took place, and was indebted to me for a great sum in November 1719, so, my lords, I declare I am not con-eqmed how, those account are exposed* if they

[. 1721. — Mr, Aiilqbic’s Defence. [870

can possibly be brought to light; and as I have this account mentioned by Mr. Surman, to produce, if your lordships require it, so I wish from the bottom of my soul, that the Green Book, so famous in story, may be produced, as perhaps it may, before it be buried in oblivion.

“ The Directors, and others, examined, to the rest of the articles, making up the seven millions and upwards, do all declare, that I was not privy, or in any manner a party -to their transactions, or in the least contributed to the loss sustained by the Company in an article of that account; as these proceedings were the chief, if not the only causes of the misfortunes of the Company and the public, I am still extremely at a loss to know what the pernicious practices were, that can make me an accomplice or confederate with the Directors. — Die selling of their own Stock, and buying it for the Company, could not, in its uature, be communicated to me, and has been denied by them all. The declaring (be great dividends at 30 per cent, for Christmas, and not less than 50 per cent, for not less than 13 years after, was a transaction when I was in the North, and they all declare I knew nothing of it. The additions to the first and second subscriptions, and the deficiencies of the third and fourth subscriptions, are attested to be done without my privity or advice. And as to the taking in any of the subscriptions at what price soever, sir Theodore Janssen, and others, have told your lordships, they were done at the instance of sir John Blunt solely, by starts and surprize, and agreed to the same day, without sending to, or advising with Mr. Aislabie, or any body* else.

“ Here, my lords, you have all the facts and pernicious practices with which the directors are charged, either by the Resolutions of the Lords or Commons; and here is not one witness that has been examined before yOur lordships, that hath not entirely acquitted me of any combination with them, in these, or any other of their pernicious practices.. These are the contents of this general charge of the Commons against me, as far as I can collect them, and which have required more pains to .discover and put together, than it has done to answer them.

“ I shall now proceed, my lords, to examine the only two facts which the Commons have thought fit to lay before your lordships, and delivered ait the Conference.

* The first of these is said to be grounded upon my own confessibn in my place in the House of Commons, viz. That on the 3d and 19th of December 1719, 22,000l. South-Sea stock was bought by Mr. Robert Knight, late cashier of the South-Sea Company, for me; and, that I delivered in to the Commons a Paper of thfe hand writing of Mr. Knight, containing part of an account, in the words following:

“ My lords, I have the greatest honour and regard for the House of Commons imaginable, and shall always pay the greatest deference to . every thing that proceeds from them; even their censure, and ray misfortunes I bear with ^patience, and submission to their authority: And as I am sensible their displeasure was tlrawn ‘ upon me by unlucky incidents, and want of opportunity of understanding the troth of my case, so I doubt not but they will he pleased that I have this opportunity of defending my innocence, and clearing it from the mistakes and general prejudice under which I have been unhappily oppressed; nor can their honour be concerned, - or that of the Secret Committee, if I. am acquitted by your lordships of the crimes laid to roy charge, if they appear to your lordships to be ill-grounded; I shall therefore .take the liberty to- say, I am extremely surprised to find the Commons make Use of the word Confession upon this occasion. Confession, .my lords, implies guilt, and is the ' declaration of some fact supposed to be criminal:But this is not my case, nor, with submission, is it the fact; this paper; my lords, this account proved by Mr. Surman, and allowed by the House of Commons to be an account of stock bought and paid for with my own . money in the beginning of December 1719, was produced by me in the House of Commons m my own justification, to prove a valuable consideration in^Mr. Knight’s bands, and security given for 20,000l. South-Sea stock bought the beginning of March following, [and paid for by Mr. Knight. This, with other eft fects of mine of great value, were proved to be in his hands at thafr time, more than sufficient to answer the valde of the said 20,000l. stock bought, by my order by Mr. Weymondsold; whereof, if any doubt remain, I am ready to produce the most authentic Vouchers.

“ThisPaper produced as evidence by me against a charge of corruption, is now, by an unaccountable turn, made an article of corruption itself, or at least tending to support the charge in the preamble in some manner. I cannot very well guess what the Commons' would infer from this account, or what it tends to, I suppose it is meant to shew, that it was done with a view to the scheme which afterwards took place, and to my own exorbitant gain, since they are pleased afterwards to subjoin this observation: That upon the 20th of January 1719, the Commons resolved, that their House would, upon the 23d of that month,

!. 1721 . — Mr. Aitlabift Defence. [*79j

resolve itself into Committee of the whole House, to consider of that part of his majesty’s speech which related to the public debts, which the House did accordingly; and that afterwards, on the 27th of January, the.House again resolved itself into the said committee, and the Committee did then receive f proposals from the South-Sea Company for paying the public debts.

“ One would think that from this observation, which the Commons themselves have made, there needs no other proof, to shew that' the stock bought in the beginning of December 1719, could not be bought with a view to the scheme, that was not accepted till two months after; and if it bad been so, it would have been no more than every chancellor of the exchequer hath done at all times before me; nay, I may ventured affirm, it hath been looked upon asincumbent Upon the chancellor of the exchequer, and all the other officers of t he revenue, to encourage, by their examples, all public undertakings of this kind; and it must not be forgot, (bat at the first establish-, ment of this very Company, the then chancellor of the exchequer, and several great officers of state, did condescend to be directors of this Company, which was never thought a crime, whether it was done with a view to their own interest or not.

“ But, my lords, I will shew that this stock was not bought with any such view; and if it were, that it does hot make good any one part of the charge in the bill; for as it was bought with my own money, it could not be a breach of trust in any manner, nor could it be a dangerous and infamous corruption, nor could it be in confederacy with the directors in their pernicious practices, which are described to have been committed by them under the colour of, the late act, and therefore subsequent to it; ' nor was it bought with a view to niy own exorbitant profit, since it was not only two months before the Commons accepted the proposals of the South Sea Company, but even before the scheme was so much as communicated to me, and, as I have proved to your lordships, was sold out again that verypnorning the South-Sea Company were resolved to outbid the Bank, and carry their point at all hazards.

“ My lords, I have proved to your lordships, that at the same time that 1 bought this stock in the South-Sea Company, I bought very near the like value in the Bank, and continued it there after I had sold out of the South-Sea, which ones not look like partiality to the South-Sea scheme. I have shewn your lordships, that immediately after the South-Sea ' proposals were accepted, I bought into the East-India Company, and not into the South-Sea Company, which is some proof that I had no great faith in their scheme, or built upon‘it with a view to my own profit: But to make it more evident that this seneme was not founded by me in that iniquity as is supposed, and that I had not those views that are laid to my charge,

I have shewn your lordships, that I was not

673] PAfcL. HISTORY, 7 George L 1721 AulaWs Dtfente. [ST4

the original author Or promoter of this scheme:

-1 have proved by sir John Blunt, that he first presented this scheme to my lord Stanhope, soon after his majesty’s return from Hanover in 1719. That my lord Stanhope, some time, after, communicated this scheme to me, and desired me to talk with sir John Blunt about it; and that accordingly, about the latter end of December, 1719, I desired Mr. Clayton to meet sir John Blunt and Mr. Knight at my own house, to confer about it; which wa? the first time thatl talked with sir John upon that subject.

“ So that, my lords, it is most evident that the stock bought in the beginning of December, could’not be bought with a view of gain from this scheme, as is suggested by the Commons in ^their paper, since the very scheme itself was 'not communicated to me until the latter end of December; at»d taking all the' other circumstances along with it, that have been explained to your lordships, I am satisfied you must think, that the Commons could not have done me a greater service, than by stating this fact as the chief matter of their accusation, which hath given me this opportunity of clearing up some mistakes, and laying open some facts that were not known or understood before.

“ Thus having cleared up this matter to your lordships, I shall proceed to answer the next and last article laid to my charge, as it was delivered by the Commons to your lordships, in which they give your lordships an account of a transaction in their House, relating to the cancelling some accounts between Mr. Hawes and me.’I do not find that the Commons made this a charge against me, in any of their Resolutions that night they committed me to the Tower; but as this story had the greatest ef-feet to inflame and raise a prejudice against me in their House, so I doubt not but that it is laid before your lordships in this solemn manner, with an expectation that it should have the same effect in this House.

“ My Lords, I know very well that many of my judges in the other House, who acquitted me of every part of the charge brought against me, could not get over this slight, this ridiculous incident. I roust own, my lords, 'my conduct upon that Occasion was not 60 calm and circumspect as my circumstances required: but it might have warmed a man of a much more even temper than myself, to see a most innocent action represented in such a suspicious light by the secret Committee, as to appear, in some measure, 'criminal: and besides this, my lords, the order mentioned at the Conference to have .been made for me to produce these ac- v counts, was introduced in such a manner, as might surprise and shock the most wary man alive; to be attacked, as I was, entering the House, and before 1 was got to my place, in a most unparliamentary method, and by an unprecedented motion, by one, who, of aU men living, bad the least right to make that demand, *»d who could furnish, if be pleased^ from his

' own books of eccompts, more matter of enquiry, than all other accoraptants put together, I should not have mentioned this, but that 1 see that transaction taken notice of in the paper delivered to your lordships at the Conference.

“ The use that hath been made of this story *, has been to inflame and stir up the minds'of men to believe that there were the greatest secrets, the most criminal matters, contained in these books; and that they were cancelled, or. burnt, in order to destroy evidence. I own, my lords, when this matter was pressed upon me in the House of Commons, I treated it with neglect and indifference, as knowing my own innocence, and not dreaming of the criminal and false construction that was afterwards put upon it But since it has been so universally understood to my prejudice, give me leave, my lordfe, in this place, to return my thanks again to my accusers, that they have given me an opportunity, before the supreme court of judicature of this kingdom, to clear up this matter, and to shew to the world, that there is nothing in this story, either criminal or suspicious.

M I thank my accusers, my lords, for giving me this opportunity of shewing the world, that there is a vast difference between an examination taken before your lordships, and an examination taken before the Secret Committee; for it may very probably happen, that they maybe mistaken in what relates to me, since every part of their report hath been either rejected or dropt by the House of Commons, which related to any other man living. '

“ I perceive your lordships took this matter first into your consideration, as observing the Commons to lay the greatest stress upon it. You have examined Mr. Hawes in the strictest manner, in relation to the nature of these accounts, and the manner of cancelling them. He has told your lordships, ‘ That there: was ‘ nothing criminal contained in those accounts; That there was nothing in them relating to me as a chancellor of the exchequer, nor to him as a director of the South Sea company, or as a receiver of the customs; that there was nothing in them that could be construed a breach of trust; nothing that could be called a combination with the South Sea directors^ or had any relation to them; nothing that could be called corruption, or any thinglike it/ Je says, 1 He bought some stock for me in December 1719, but that it was sold again in three or four days after, for very small profit. And lastly, he says, this stock was bought and paid for with my own money, and not with the public money, or the Company’s money/ As to the manner of cancelling them, he says, It was done in October last, before the king’s return, and long before the-parliament met; that I had long since passed my public accounts, viz. in April 1720, that those accounts were passed at my pressing - instances in half the time that any of my predecessors had passed theirs; that I had afterwards daily so- licited him to have those private accounts

* aade op and delivered, but that his affairs would not permit him to do it till October

* last; That I had pressed him to deliver up « these accounts, not only long before the stock

* fell, but before it rose; that these accounts

* were cancelled, after I had given him a dis-‘ charge, by mutual consent; and that he be-

* lieves it was not done with a design to cohceal

* them from this enquiry/

. “ My lords, this is the Evidence of Mr. Hawes; and I do not wonder that your lord-phips were under some surprize, that a matter represented in so different a light, and with which my enemies have made so much noise and clamour, should, at last, come out as a fair and indifferent action, in which neither the public nor any private person was concerned, and to have been done without a design of concealing or covering any fraud whatsoever.

* e There is something, my lords, I must ob> serve to you upon this occasion, that makes me wonder how this transaction came to be so much insisted on, unless it was to iuflaipe more than to convince; and that is, my lords, (as I humbly conceive) that in case these books had beep in being, and there had been any thing criminal in them, or that might any way affect me to my prejudice, your lordships would not, as you are a court of justice, oblige me to produce them against myself; this is a fundamental maxim in law, and has never been broke through in the most violent and arbitrary times. And the House of Lords, in their enquiries in 1640, were 90 tender of this great principle of law and justice, that they made it a special instruction to their Committee, that the judges they had ordered to be examined, should not be examined upon any thing to accuse themselves. And the Commons, during all the enormities of those times, never broke through this rule, till they came to deckle all things by the sword:And therefore, my lords, if these accounts could not judicially be demanded of me, in case they were in being, and contained any thing criminal in them; there can certainly be no dime in any having disposed of them as I •thought fit, especially if it be considered, that they were my Own private bosks, no ways relating to me as a public accomptant, committing nothing in them criminal, or »ffjpc»i»g the interest of any other person.

“ I know, my lords, very well, that in the case of a deed destroyed, if a witness proves that there was iu that deed any clause to the advantage of a third person, or to the prejudice of him that destroyed it, such clause shall be construed in the strongest manner against the perms that destroyed the deed. But this, my lords, is not my cnee: here is no evidence produced to prove any thing criminal in these accounts, but on the contrary; so that in law and equity they would bn taken as acoouats subsisting in my favour, though unadvisedly cancelled. Mr. Hawes’s testimony, relating to the aoooouots in these books, affords your lordships another instance, that may satisfy your ships that X bad no view to toe Booth

Sea scheme in my transactions contained in those books; since it appears by his evidence concerning the stock mentioned in them, that I parted with it before the scheme took place. But let that be as it will, can any raau call it a criminal circumstance to commit the papers^ after they were cancelled, to the fire ? No my lords, it was a legal and an innocent action.

“ Thus, my lords, I have gone through every part of the charge against me, either as it has been stated by the Commons ', or fallen under the examination of your lordships; and I hope there is nothing omitted in ray defence, that ia necessary to prove my innocence to the satisfaction of all that hear me; but if the least doubt remain with your lordships, in relation to auy one fact charged upon me, 1 beg I may have the opportunity, before I go from this bar, of clearing it up, which I do not doubt to do by the plainest proofs in the. world.

“ If therefore the charge of the Commons jo the preamble oJT this bill cannot be supported iu any part of it, by any one feet whatsoever, can your lordships ever be induced to consent to such parts of the bill as subject me to an arbitrary jurisdiction, and cruel and new invented punishments? My lords, the laws are our birthright, and the guide and measure of all our actions; but where is the law that I have broken ? Or, indeed, where is the crime, nr the fact that is supposed to be a crime, and which is to be punished by a law made post facto A law,

my lords, that dispenses with the very forms of judicature, and sets up a tribunal unheard of before in any free country ?

“ I believe, my lords, this bill is very little understood by most of the gentlemen of the House of Commons; aqd, perhaps, your lordships may think the penalties of this bill less severe, at least in respect to me, than they are, but your lordships will give me leave to explain that matter to you in such a manner, that yon may better judge, whether I have committed any offence equal to Such severe and Ignominious punishments.

“ My lords, as the bill now stands, all my personal estate, and great part of my real astute, which belonged to me on the 1st of June 1710, or at any time since, is vested in the trustees, to be sold and applied to the uses of this net; so that I am script at once of every shilling fett what is settled upon ray family, and wherein I am but tenant for life. After this, asy lords, I am obliged to give lOOyOOOO/. security by recognizance, with two other persons to be bound for me in £5,000l. a piece, that I shall not depart the kingdom before a certain time. This was not the case of the directors, hat it is mine, that after my estate is taken from me, I am obliged to give security 4o the value of ten times mere than I am worth. Is there a friend in the wodd that can believe I am guilty of the least thing laid to my charge, thaturillbe aecarity for me in this situation ? Or have I any oouoter security to give, but the little stock of credit and reputation that this bill cannot take away ? But -some

* 77] I>ARL. HISTORY, 7 George I.

gentlemen think, and my enemies boast, that they have keen very bountiful to me, and they have made me easy. If that be the case, my lords, what occasion is there to saspect I should fly from my country, my friends, and my estate ? But if my case be otherwise, if I am worse used than any of the directors; if I am more branded and exposed than any other person in this bill; who will not be apt to judge, from what has passed, that the same spirit that has brought me to this, may be carried to greater extremity ? Am I not by this bill put into the power of every villain, of this very broker here, whose evidence is his merit ? Am I not obliged to live in the dread, and at the ihercy of every informer like him ? Others may think, and the directors perhaps may think life under these circumstances to be tolerable; but to me, my lords, there can be no comfort in it, but what my own innocence secures to me.

“ There are some clauses in the bill that oblige the to give in inventories of my real and personal estate from such times, and in such a manner, as is impossible to be complied with; having never kept my accounts in such a method, as those that are bred up to trade and figures are used to do; and I believe very few gentlemen in the kingdom would, in their own cases, think this practicable. But if my accounts had been regularly kept, as I have no clerks or book-keepers to swear to them, so I do not know of what use' it could be to produce them to these trustees, in case they are minded to dispute them; for though they are entitled only to the incrementum of my estate since the first of October 1716, yet as they are to be vested with the whole of my personal, and great part of my real estate; and as I am to deliver tip all my writings, papers, and accounts to them, it is impossible to make out any claim before them in any manner whatsoever. And pray, my lords, observe the difficulties or absurdities of this case: Here is a court erected of nine persons, with absolute and unlimited powers; .some of these gentlemen, perhaps, have been accusers, but all of them are to be judges and parties; my estate and my title is to be put into their bands, and then I am td claim what can never be made out, .but by the very writings in their possession. Was ever such a jurisdiction established upon earth before, where laws were in use ? No, my lords, the original cause of all laws, and of civil government was to prevent men’s judging for themselves, and to oblige them to submit all disputable matters^to indifferent parties; This is in a particular manner the basis of all our laws, and it is the only pillar by which justice and equity oau be supported.

d*But, my lords, there is another circum-ataace, which, in the' situation of iny affairs, makes any claim impracticable; that is, my lords, the oaas probandi lies, in a great measure, upon me, which, in regard to my personal estate, is impossible; unless my judges are willing to be guided by the circumstances of my affairs, and my own testimony.

[.1721. — Mr. Aislabic’s Dtftnce. [876

“ For instance, my lords, it appears to your lordships that there was an account between Mr. Hawes and me for seven years past, wherein most of my effects were contained, and he says about 30,000l. South Sea stock was bought before the scheme took place, with my own money:It appears by the paper delivered at the Conference, that I bought by Mr. Knight, two months before the South Sea proposals took place, 27,000l. South Sea stock, ana had several other effects in his hands; and Mr. Surman has proved that Mr. Knight told him, that he owed me a great sum of money long before this, having kept my cash for two or three years before, noue of which can be supposed to be the increase of my es-> tate since October 1718. How is it possible niy lords, I can prove one word of it r As to Mr. Knight, it is not expected I should produce him; and as for Mr. Hawes, be says, those accounts are cancelled, and he has made no other entry’of them. How is it possible, then, to prove anything, especially to the satisfaction of my judges, who are also parties ? For it must be to their satisfaction, and not otherwise, the bill says, that my proofs must be made. If they are not pleased to be satisfied, then, indeed, I may appeal to another coart erected for this purpose, viz. to the judges" in Westminster Hall, who will expect legal evidence to maintain an appeal, ijvhich, in my case, my lords, I have shewn, is not to be done.

“ I cannot but take notice of one punishment more that seems to be oddly suited to that part of my accusation relating to the cancelling of my accounts with Mr. Hawes: The Commons, for want of having that matter cleared up, as it has been before your lordships, have thought that transaction a great offence; and the punishment of that offence is, that I shall make up those very accounts, which my accusers say are destroyed, and which are no more in being; indeed I must own they have been so kind as to exempt ine from all danger on this head for the future, by disabling me from having any more accounts to make up.

“ Since I have spoke of disabling, my lords,

I beg leave to take notice of a clause that contains a new and dangerous punishment, that was lately added to this bill; that is, my lords, the clause for incapacitating the late sub-governor, &c. from sitting or voting in either house of parliament, or from holding any office or place of trust under his majesty, his heirs or successors.

“ My lords, I roust presume to say, from some little incidents that have happened, this clause was not the punishment of a South Sea sin, and these unfortunate men were only thrown in, to make the draught go down the better. But how consistent this punishment may be with good policy and a free government, I submit to your lordships consideration.

“ Here are no less than 3& fellow subjects cut off at one stroke from the commonwealth, and stript of the birthrights and privileges of

S79] PARL. HISTORY, 7 George I. 1721. — ilfr. [880,

Englishmen; I mention it to’your lordships as you are the guardians of those rights and privileges, that you may oppose an attempt, in its first instance, that seems to threaten our constitution, and shake even Magna Charta itseiT No man, since we were a nation, has be?n so bold as to think of creating so danger* ous a precedent, which, if it had been established sooner, had before this day exceedingly thinned the ranks of our ablest patriots.

“ But, my lor^s, if this Bill must _pa9S in any manner as to me, I am not concerned as to the effects of this clause. I say, if this Bill pass, (as they say it must) my ambition is at an end; it is too late far me to begin the world again; but an ill-natured man would be pleased, 'at his going off the stage, to leave this legacy to those that come after him.

“ Precedents, my lords, will advance, and this precedent will not sleep. The violence of the times, and the rage of parties, is too great to drop a precedent so useful as this will be.

“ I shall trouble your lordships no more than to say, that if I must be sacrificed to appease the fury of the misguided multitude, I heartily wish it may have that effect, which will he some alleviation to my misfortunes. But in, vain have the guilty appeared against me! in vain have they stirred up the nation for one man’s ruin; my fall will screen or secure no man; if I am innocent, there is nothing can make me guilty. Let the storm rage never so high at present, Englishmen w'ill grow calm by degrees, truth is great, and will prevail.”

Mr. Aislabie being withdrawn, the Lords ordered such other Witnesses, as he had to produce, to be examined the next day; and that the directors of the Sword-Blade Company should then attend with their books. Accordingly, on the 90th of .July, the Lords in a grand committee, resumed the consideration of that affair, and examined the Sword-Blade Company, and their books, by which it appearing, that Mr. Waller bad received vast sums on . account of South-Sea stock, their lordships did not think fit to call for any other witnesses; neither did Mr. Aislabie desire, that the members of the Commons, who had been summoned, should be examined.

Ma. Aislabie’s second Defence.] But being called in, and asked, what he had farther to say in his own defence, he spoke as follows:

“ My Lords, '

"I have already endeavoured, and, I hope, •with success, to satisfy your lordships, that the charge laid against me in the Bill now depending, cannot be supported by any general part of the preamble, nor by the particular‘facts stated by the Commons, nor by any evidence

Jproduced before your lordships. — As your ordships have examined all the witnesses recommended by the Commons to support their charge, I dkfc conclude, when I came hither tbi» day, after wtyft said yesterday, I

should not be called upon to offer any thing more in my justification.

“ But now, my lords, I find here is a new matter started, relating to Mr. Waller’s account with the Sword-Blade Company, which is not within your lordships’ order, that confines me to such matters only as relate to my own defence. I have been a little surprized and silent upon this occasion, not knowing whether your lordships expected, or whether it was fit that I should take any notice of it; for as the Commons have not transmitted this matter to your lordships, as a ground of their charge, I take it for granted, they did not think it wort hjy our lordships’ enquiry, or proper for your judgment, being rather a matter of clamour, and only calculated for the people.

“ I must own, my lords, if it is expected I should give an account of this transaction, I am at a loss to know bow to go about it. For, first, I do not know the contents of this account, and, in the next place, how shall 1 make it bear to my charge, or any part of it ? How is it made out to he a breach of trust in the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to credit his son-in-law with any sum of money ? Or how has he thereby combined with the South-Sea directors in their pernicious practices ? Or how could he, in such an act, be guilty of dangerous and infamous corruption ? There has nothing appeared to your lordships concerning this transaction, but the sum total of the whole account in such a time; and it may happen, that a great part of this transaction has no relation to South-Sea stock, and that a tenth part of it does not belong to me.

“ But where are my labours to end ? How is it possible, my lords, for me to dress up this matter to be a charge against myself; It is to be imagined, I suppose, that all these transactions have been upon my account, and, consequently, that I must have been a grefet gainer. 1 pity the malice of my enemies, that are reduced to such poor shifts, as to endeavour to prove my deep views and designs from, the most stupid folly in the world, and ipy riches and exorbitant gains from this instance, and another which I shall presently mention to your lordships, that plainly shew my losses: For is it possible, my lords, that a man, who' is supposed to know the world, that is thought capable of forming a scheme, and of directing the very directors, should be so destitute of proper agfnts, as to trust Jus negotiations to an unexperienced youth, who, by his transactions, seems to have dipt as much in the whims of the alley, as any adventurer of them all ? The absurdity is too great, my lords, to gain credit any where, much less in this place, that one, ' upon whom the eyes of the world were fixed, and whose actions mijrht be canvassed with great severity, should, in order to conceal his affairs, commit them to a near relation, acting in the most open and unguarded manner.

“ And as my apprehensions, during the execution.of this scheme, were become remarkable, and the jest of all that embarked in it, there caa

881] PARL HISTORY, .7 George I

be nothing more extravagant than to make me a party to this gentleman’s transactions, which were visibly carried on with a spirit very different from mine, and which, from the nature of them, seem to be the effect of rash councils, and suited to the phrenzy of the times. Mr.

1 Waller, my lords, is a near relation, but entirely .independent of me, and who consulted me less upon this occasion, than any other man, whereof, this transaction with the Sword-Blade Company is the strongest evidence: For, as he has jtold your lordships, that 1 never knew of this account, or his keeping his cash there till they broke; so it is improbable I should trust all my pffairs to his management, who dealt with a .company in whom I never had any ftrith, nor with whom I ever had any dealings.

“ As to the greatness of this transaction, I fuust own, my lords, if the memory of this year could.be obliterated, it might very well surprize us; but I must observe to your lordships, that Jbis sum of 700,000l. is not tire balance of the account at any one point of time, as is generally understood, but the total amount of several jsums paid and repaid many times backward And forward, and sometimes great part of it the same day. And any person used to accounts must know, the 40th part of this sum yv’dS more than sufficient to answer the whole sum of 700,000l.

“ Many of your lordships know the truth of what Mr. Waller has told you, viz. that a great many young gentlemen, and others, (whose beginning was not so considerable as Mr. Waller’s, who had a very gpod real and personal es-. tate before the South-Sea scheme was thought of) have transacted for as much as be did. Nor does it follow from the greatness of the transaction, that the profit was extraordinary, since many have dealt for greater sums than this, whose fortunes are far from being improved; and it is very plain, that 10,000l. stock, not stirred at all, till sold out at the best advantage, would have brought more profit than all these numerous transactions put together.

“ My lords, I am very free to own, that 53, OQO/. of this sum belonged to me, great part whereof is now locked up in the Sword-Blade Company, and depends upon the goodness of their security; and I am far from declining to give your lordships the most perfect account I can of all my transactions, notwithstanding Mr.

' Waller is not able to do it, who never kept any regular accounts that ever I saw, but did every thing in the same hurry and confusion, as most other young gentlemen at that time did. I do not pgrcfike that your lordships have entered into the examination of this account, any farther than to know the sum total, which has not t^ken up much of your lordships time, notwithstanding the gentlemen of the Secret Commit* tee have employed much pains in it, and have displayed it as a discovery of my immense gains, and a transaction entirely belonging to myself.

“ My lords, it is very hard, that against all evidence, against all truth, and every circum-Vol. VII.

1721Afr. Aislabie’s Defence. [8S2

stance that conduces to it, such an insinuation should proceed from any one man, or comjnitr tee of men, to the prejudice, or ruin, of an innocent person. I dare say, my lords, they had no other grounds in the world for it, but the vain presumption from Mr. Waller’s near relation to roe, that be acted solely for me; whereas it now appears to your lordships, by Mr. Waller’s evidence, that he acted for many other friends as well as for me, and that I was not so much as privy to the accounts he kept with the Sword-Blade Company. Is it then possible, my lords, that your lordships should give way to so groundless a supposition, as that all this account should belong to me ?

“ My lords, if this way of proceeding ihad been the general rule of judging in the cases of others, the Secret Committee might have carried on their enquiries against many in the administration, with much more justice and certainty than against me; and they might, if they had thought fit, from the dealings of several agents, friends, and dependents, who dealt for much more than Mr. Waller, have furnished matter of imputation against persons, concerning whom, they are altogether silent. And if it had not been too invidious in roe, my lords, tp have asked the question, Mr. Waller could have named to you some persons, who had less foundation of their own than himself, and who et have transacted for much more, and who ave the honour to be known to some of the Secret Committee, as well as to much greater men than myself,

“ But, my lords, as I am confined to what only relates to myself, give me leave to say, that this account of Mr. Waller’s with the Sword-Blade. Company, and the account of stock* bought and sold by Mr. Weymondsold, have been the chief grounds of my accusation, or rather of the public clamour; though of the whole balance of this account of Mr. Waller’s when truly examined, there is but 53,000l. belongs to me; and Mr. Weymondsold’s great account of 77^000/. stock, when fairly stated, is reduced to 13,000l. stock, now in my hands. It was impossible to work people up to such violent and extraordinary proceedings, without first raising the public envy and resentment. It was therefore thought necessary to make the world believe, that I was immensely rich, and that I had gained my wealth from the spoils and ruin of the unhappy sufferers. It was necessary to make the world believe, that the scheme was calculated by me with that view, and that I had the sole coitduct of it, or, according to the witty turn of a very learned gentleman, that I was the director of the directors.

“ As-the opinion, my lords, of my exorbitant gains has almost universally prevailed, be pleased to give me leave to explain how a report, so artfully raised and dispersed about the nation, came, at last, to be strengthened, and, as it were, sanctified by authority of the House of Commons.

“ The Secret Committee, who were ap-

3L

885] PAUL. HISTORY, 7 George

pointed to enquire into these proceedings, had, with great pains and application, examined and searched into every thing; but before they could be ready to lay any great discoveries before the House, in order to satisfy the impatience of gentlemen in some manner, and to give a specimen of their labours, an honourable member of that Committee stood up, and pronounced in his place, that he had found out above 10 millions that belonged to the directors, and, by way of supplement, above a million and a half more that belonged to another gentleman, whom he did not think At to name at that time. This hopeful beginning gave much satisfaction to those who delight in great discoveries, and raised the expectation of all his hearers: But so dull was 1^ as not to

find out that I was concerned in this description, 'till every libel, and every news-paper was fbll of it. But what did these vain promises amount to? Your lordships have seen what the directors have produced, and how far short it falls of this romantic account. And as to myself, the object of this solemn enquiry, I doubt I shall not contribute much, though this bill should pass, to raise the reputation of the Secret Committee in these wonderful discoveries.

“ Thus, my lords, I have cleared my way through all the dirt and scandal that hath been thrown upon me; I shall now beg leave, my lords, to lay before you a short narrative of the rise And progress of this scheme, and the execution of it, after it passed into an act, as far as has come to my knowledge, that your lordships may judge whether I have done my duty, or have been guilty of any omission.

* My lords, I have proved by sir John Blunt, that he first communicated his scheme to the late lord Stanhope, soon after his majesty's return from Hanover, in 1719 J that my lord Stanhope, some time after, sent this scheme to me, and desired me to talk with sir Jonh Blunt about it, which 1 did in the presence of Mr. Clayton and Mr. Knight; that there •were several alterations made in this scheme, and, particularly, in one part of it relating to the funds- of the Bank-and the Bast India Company, which were proposed to be incorporated into the funds of the South Sea Company.

“ And, at last, the scheme was formed and agreed to by all those in the administration, as it was first opened and proposed in the House of Commons. And I do aver here, before your lordships, that there was not one step taken in this affair before it passed into an act, that was not taken by the concurrence and Approbation of those in the administration, and even some of the Secret Committee: and so cautious and diffident was I of the success of so great an undertaking, that though' the scheme was adapted to the notions And opinions of those gentlemen, who, for two sessions before, had opposed all measures for reducing the interest of tlmpublic debts, till the Long Annuities were made'redeemable; yet 1 would not adventure to introduce it to the House of Commons, till it

1721. — 3fr. Aislabie’s Defence* [881

had been communicated to and Approved of by them: and as this scheme was then calculated with no inconsiderable advantages to the public; as it at once raised three millions and a half towards the discharge of the public debts; and, at the same time, put the Long and Short Annuities into a state of being redeemed; and, after four years, reduced the, interest of the whole debt of England to percent, and thereby made a vast addition to the sinking fund; I flatter myself, it could not have been thought a bad bargain to the public, as some were pleased to represent it, or liable to those unhappy consequences that have attended the alteration of it, since it would have been restrained and tied down to such conditions, as would have made it impossible for. any projectors to have hurt us.

“ But, my lords, these measures were aH broke at' once, by a sudden resolution of the Bank, who, before, bad shewn a great backwardness in undertaking any thing for the re1* during the public debts, ana had treated this scheme with great contempt; I say, my lords, as soon as this scheme was opened in the House of Commons, the gentlemen of the Bank were immediately stirred up to become competitors for it, and to desire that they might be suffered to offer proposals as well as the South Sea Company.

“ It was .very easy to see the consequences of this competition; and I expressed ray fears to all those in the king's service that were consulted about it; and we had a meeting, where the lords of the treasury, and those in the administration, were present, in order, as sir John Blunt says, to persuade the South Sea Company to advance their proposals, and to' offer four millions certain: It was then, my lords, that I again expressed my fears of this undertaking, and declared, that I did not see how the South Sea Company could go through with it, if they were to give any more money for it, without the assistance and concurrence of the Bank, and much less, if the Bank opposed them; and upon this, I proposed to the South Sea Company, that the scheme should be divided between them and the Bank, which drew from sir John Blunt this memorable saying, No, sir, we will never divide the child/ For my part, my lords, upon this occasion, I was entirely for dropping it; nor could I be prevailed upon, by those that pressed mfe very warmly, to have any thing more to do in it; and when a certain gentleman of the Secret Committee, at the instance of an honourable gentleman that is since dead, moved the House, that the Committee' might be opened again, to receive fresh proposals from the two companies, and, as it were, to set up the nation to auction, I was so. far from approving it, or giving my consent to it, that I quitted the House upon it, and would not be present when it was moved. This, I think, was shewing my dislike of it, as far as I could decently do it, in respect to my fellow servants, from whom I differed; and I defy any man to prove, that from that day, till

8SS] PARL. HISTORY, 7 George I, 1721. — itfr. [S80.

the last proposals of the South Sea Company were actually accepted by the Rouse of Commons, I ever spoke to, or couferred with, or advised any one of the Directors of the South Sea Company, to bid a shilling more than they had done; and if they did advise with any in the administration about these last proposals, it was either at my late lord Stanhope's, or at Mr. Secretary Craggs’s; for they never came to my house afterwards, till the bill was drawn. And, my lords, to shew you my dislike of this fatal transaction, (since all the arguments against me are drawn from interest) I must acquaint you, that the night before these proposals were offered the House of Commons, 1 was told at my lord Stanhope's, that some of the South Sea Company had been there, and that they were resolved to out bid the Bank at any rate. To this, my lords, I then declared my dislike, and gave orders that night to sell out all my South Sea stock, (except 2,000l.) which was actually done the next morning, and which makes so great a figure in. Weymondsold’s account* Thus, my lords, if we were to judge from interest, I could not be thought partial to the South Sea Company’s proposals, when I bad so little stock with them, and so much in the Bank; and, my lords, there is nothing more notorious, nor which can be proved by more witnesses, than that I did not go out to the Directors that morning, to advise them to out-bid the Bank, (as sir John Blunt would insinuate, though he has been contradicted in it by Mr. Joye and others) but that I sat still in ray place in the House of Commons, until the proposals were received, expressing my dislike of them to ail those about me, and publicly declaring in the House, that I thought both the corporations had out-bid themselves.

; “ Thus was this scheme accepted, and as sir John Blunt says, become the act of the Rouse of Commons; and, as it was their act, it was my duty, by the nature of my office, to see the bill, drawn and brought in accordingly.

* My lords, there was something very extraordinary in the consequence of this affair, that the more the South Sea Company were to pay to the public, the higher did their stock rise upon it: Whether this proceeded only from the distemper of the times, that afterwards broke out into such a flame, and which was kindled by the opposition of the Bank, and the value they set upon the scheme, by bidding so high for it; or from what other cause I cannot tell; but from that time it became difficult to govern it; and let those gentlemen that opened the flood -gates wonder at the deluge that ensued as inuch as they please, it was not in one man’s power, or in the power of the whole administration, to stop it, considering how the world was born away by the torrent, and particularly the members of the House of Commons: ana I will be bold to say, my lords, and the gentlemen of the Bank, I believe, will own, that if they had carried the scheme upon their last proposals, they could not have executed it with success; ' and I will shew your lordships from

what they have done since, that they would have acted in the same manner as the South Sea Company hath done, and I am sure with more fatal consequences to the public.

“ Thus, my lords, was this Bill passed, and whatever conditions, or restraints might have been put upon the South Sea Company, if the ' first proposals had been accepted, they became now impracticable; nor would the South Sea. Company submit to be controuled in an undertaking they were to pay so dear for. And notwithstanding it has been said that the scheme could have been executed at 150; yet Mr. Gibbon has told you, and so will all the other Directors, that they would not have undertaken to have given so much, as five millions, if they had been restrained from selling their stock higher than at that price. And therefore, as there was no power reserved to the treasury to controul the Directors in the execution of the scheme; and as there were such vast advantages to accrue from it to the public, there was nothing remained for the treasury to do, but to give them all the assistance they could, and particularly, what the law had provided for them.

“ For this reason, my lords, the exchequer notes were issued to them, though at that time their stock was high, and perhaps they might not want them very much, since it was easy at that time for them to raise what sum they pleased by subscriptions.

“ But as they were intitled^to those notes, and as they were demanded of the treasury according to law, the commissioners of the-treasury could not be so indiscreet, as to refuse them, without taking upon themselves the blame of any miscarriage; and it is very plaiu, that the wisest of the directors, who saw their stock carried to that monstrous height, where it never could be supported, were apprehensive of the consequences of it, and were looking out for every pretence to lay the blame upon the administration.

“ But though I was always upon mypiard in this point, yet I do declare, I never was Wanting to serve and assist them to the utmost of my power. And though perhaps, tny lords, it was in the power of the treasury, if they would have taken upon them what did not belong to them, to have rua down the stock; yet considering the parliament was then sitting, the greatest part whereof were deeply engaged in it; it had been a bold undertaking for this treasury to have attempted to have brought, down the stock, and must have drawn upon themselves the rage of all the sufferers, and sure destruction.

“ This unhappy affair, my lords, began at a time when the passion and avaricious desires of mankind are grown up to a madness and a distemper, and one cannot without pity look back upon the rage and folly of the year. The unaccountable success of this undertaking gave birth to" many base and ruinous-projects; and it must ever be a public reproach, that encouragement was given, to those two bubbles that.

6S7] PARL. HISTORY, 7 George 1.1721 AitlabWs Defence. [888

were established, to raise a supply for the support of the civil list; it is very well known that those, two projects did not proceed from me. Whatever opinion the world may have of the South Sea scheme, I will presume to Say, these two projects were founded in greater iniquity, and contributed more to the public calamity than any thing else.

“ After this, my lords, I may venture to say the South Sea scheme was become ungovernable; and some of the wisest of the Directors were so sensible of it, that to do them justice I .must declare, they fame to the treasury, and offered to advance the money for the Civil last upon sure and easy terms, rather than that those bubbles should take place.

“ But though the treasury were provided with ways and means for a supply to the Civil last, without the help of either; yet those projects, and others, had taken such deep root in the House of Commons, and elsewhere, as made it impossible to oppose them:and they had that consequence which the Directors of the South Sea Company foretold, and which every body might foresee, viz. to encrease the flame, by adding this unnecessary fuel to it. As the South Sea Scheme might give birth to the bubbles, so the bubbles contributed to raise the South Sea to that height which brought us into this condition.

u My Ibrds, I must not omit in this place to take notice, that this spirit of bubbling* had prevailed so universally, that, to shew you what would have been the case if the Bank had obtained the scheme, the very Bank became a bubble; and this, my lords, not by chance or necessity, or from any engagement to raise money for the public service, but from the same spirit that actuated Temple-mills, or Garaway^ fishery. For this purpose, my lords, they entertained a scheme, in imitation of the Sooth Sea, of lending money upon their stock, Which as it is contributed to raise the price of their own stock, so it furnished a supply of cash to the gamesters in the alley, that at once pushed up the bubbles and the South Sea to an immoderate height. But as this was intended chiefly to advance their own stock, let the project come frtm what hand soever, it was founded in the same iniquity with any other bubble, and was of ten times more dangerous consequence: For as Bank stock was raised by it from 150 to 245, and as it bas fallen from thence to 130, there have been many millions lost upon it; besides the- fatal consequence it had like to have had uppn the public credit; for, for want of this money, which Was locked up in loans upon their Own stock, and could not readily be, come at, they were at a loss when the crush happened, and were forced tO have recourse to a subscription, supported chiefly by the adventurers of the South Sea, and to a memorable bargain with the South Sea Company.

* And here my lords, whilst I am speaking upon this subject, give me leave to lament the fate of the unhappy proprietors of the redeem-

able debts, that Were drawn in to subscribe, their respective estates, not so much from the arts of the South Sea Directors, as From the fatal influence and example of some of the chief managers and friends of the Bank; who, though they now make the greatest clamour for justice, were the first that subscribed the re-deemables into the South Sea Company; and this, my lords, they did not do by surprise or mistake, but upon great deliberation; having some time before prepared for this subscription, and purchased great part of this debt, at advanced prices for this purpose; And there are some of these gentlemen, and even some of my accusers, that purchased the redeemables, •who thought, me extremely silly for advising them against endeavouring to make their fortunes by this project. And it is likewise very remarkable, ray lords, that a letter was produced to the House of Commons, under the hands of the chief directors of the Bank, whereby -they made the most early application, and in the most humble and abject terms to their most determined enemy, sir John Blunt, to be admitted to this subscription. It was no wou-der then that the wisest and most cautious of their admirers went along with them, and much less that the crowd should be led into this fatal error by their example.

“I do not say this, my lords, to lay any blame' or imputation upon the Bank, but to shew your lordships, that this grave and cautious body of men were touched with the infatuation as well as others; and that some of their greatest friends, and the loudest complainants, were, in spite of all advice, the greatest pushers in this chimerical project.

“ I must own, my lords, I was pretty much surprized to see tins work going on; but as the act of parliament had entirely divested the treasury of all power and controul over the South Sea Directors, in respect to the redeemable debts, we could be only spectators of this melancholy scene.

“ Of this the Company was not ignorant, and therefore did not think fit to consult me, or any of my brethren, abont it, but hurried it on to execution at once. They knew their power too well, and were too much elated with their prosperity, to think of consulting with the treasury upon that occasion; and to shew your lordships, how vain it had been for^the treasury to have interposed, and of what little weight the chancellor of the exchequer was at that time with these gentlemen, before the treasury w*\s adjourned, I waited upon some of the directors at the South Sea honse, to know if they had any commands for the treasury. I, indeed, took the liberty to recommend to them, in a particular manner, the expediting the duplicates of the subscriptions of the redeemable and irredeemable debts, that the proprietors might have their stock in their own hands as soon as possible; but I found them too busy in making their loans, and squandering away the Company’s money, to mind such trifles; and so I was dismissed by sir John Blunt, with

C gle

860] PARL. HISTORY, 7 Geoboe I

leave to go into the country. Such was the pride of this mighty projector at that time, to whom so many have bowed and sued for favours.

“ We have lost the memory of every thing, if in so short a time it can be forgot how the eyes of the world were turned from the treasury, and the chief ministers of state, to this great oracle, whose word (as sir Theodore Janssen says) was a law to the Company. To him we owe every motion, and every desperate step that was taken in the execution of this scheme: and therefore I cannot help saying, that the countenance which has been shewn him in another place, is due to a merit that has not yet been made known to. the public.

“ But this glory, my lords, did not-last long, and I was scarce got down into the country, when I was called back by the cries of those concerned in this unhappy Company. I found the Lords and others in the administration met, and using their endeavours to succour and sap-port the stock. The Bank by their mediation was called in to the assistance of the South-Sea Company, and an agreement was made between the two Companies, to which I was rather a witness than a party.

“ This gave some life to their stock, and stopped the mouths of the redeemables, who were grown very clamorous. I must own the just concern I had at that time, and shall always retain for this great body of the public creditors; and I was pleased to see them so well satisfied with the bargain the Bank had tnade for them, and for themselves, upon whom they pinned their faith so absolutely. And for my part, I who was not in the secret could not but think it a real, and sincere bargain, since it was made in so solemn a manner, between a committee of both companies, in the presence of many lords and gentlemen in the administration, connrmed and ratified by the Court of Directors of each company, and last signified in form to the commissioners of the Treasury, by sir John Cope, one of the Directors of the Bank. '

“ I could not suspect there was any intrigue, or deceit in this transaction, until I saw, from the extraordinary motions in the alley, and . several private hints that were given out, what was intended. I could not think it possible that the gentlemen of the Bank, who had such great interest in the redeemables themselves, .should drop so many thousands of the unhappy proprietors, who had depended so entirely Upon them, and who would certainly have found their way out of this cursed labyrinth, if they had not been lulled asleep bgr this fallacious agreement.

“ As for me, my lords, I was thoroughly satisfied that this agreement of the Bank, was a legal and a firm bargain: and I cannot yet Imagine, with what face of justice, or equity, they could ever break through it, without providing for the safety of their wards, (if I may tose that expression) the proprietors of the redeemable debts. *

1721. — Mv Aishbie*!} tkfeMt. [890

“ Whilst that bargain subsisted, and whilst the great frauds and embezzlement of the South-Sea Company's money were concealed, at least from me; and whilst loans as yet were not remitted by the House of Commons, I did not think these proprietors had so ill a bargain, or could be so great Sufferers as I nbw find they are: for this reason, my lords, with much reluctance, and after all the delays that could be -made, in order to give these gentlemen the opportunity to withdraw their subscriptions, if they thought fit, we did sign the instrument to the Exchequer, as the law directs, and as we thoaght ourselves bound to do:but there was that caution used, that after we had sent the duplicates back to the South-Sea House to be corrected, and in order to give these gentlemen time to look about them, there was not one person that.pursued the law, or made use of the known method of revoking his powers given by letters of attorney, that was not relieved; and so far were the proprietors indulged by favour of the Treasury, that every person who entered his protest there, had his claim satisfied by the South-Sea Company, beibre the duplicates were allowed, and the instrument signed. But after all this, my lords, I must declare^ that as I had no design of forming a power upon their ruin, so no views or solicitations upon-earth, should have prevailed with me to Cohclude them in their properties, if 1 had thought the Bank would have dropt them ', and withdrawn themselves, or that the loans would have been remitted.

“ My lords, I heartily lament the misfortunes of those, who being drawn in by others, had not the opportunity, or skill, to relieve themselves:but for those, my lords, that were learned in the law, or at the head of the law, and who by their example, and perhaps authority, drew others into this misfortune, I am not concerned if they are punished for their folly, hi purchasing these debts, in order to subscribe them in with a view to their own exorbitant profit; and no man can pity them that crowded in with so much precipitation, and who, after so much time for recollection, had not law enoughjn so known a case, to find their way out again.

“ I do not intend, my lords, by what I have said, to lay any imputation upon the Bank of England; for, as in all great bodies, there are few that are let into the secret, I suppose it might so happen here; but if what I have heard since be true, and what they say has been publicly avowed, that this bargain was never intended to be kept; then, t say, it was not only a useful secret to those that were in it, but the most complete stratagem of the whole year. But whoever hath contributed to the misfortunes of the redeemable creditors, Sure I am, their destruction cannot justly be imputed to me; since I have Only, as one of the commissioners of the Treasury, complied with the law, where I heartily wish they may find what relief is due to them, If I may be allowed, my lords, to take notice of another

body of unhappy sufferers in this common calamity, I believe I shall easily gain credit, if I assure your lordships, that I have nothing to answer for with respect to the money-subscribers. There is not one roan in the kingdom that can lay his misfortunes, on that account, at my door. No body can sav, that I advised, or encouraged him in those adventures; there are letters to be produced, that would make my enemies ashamed, even some of the Secret Committee themselves, of their humble solicitations for those favours.

“ As to the proprietors of the Old-Stock, they have no reason to complain of me; I have not robbed them by loans for myself or any of my friends; and as all the witnesses that have been examined, have entirely acquitted me, of advising, or being privy to any of those Joans, so I challenge all the world to prove that I ever recommended any one man to the Company, to partake of them. And if I bad those avaritious views, that are suggested, I must have mistaken my way very much, and have been little in the secret, not to have secured a good share of the public spoils out of these unwarrantable loans.

u But as these loans, and the Directors buying their own private stock for the Company, with the Company’s money, were the chief, if not the only causes of our misfortunes, and the ruin of the public credit; so, my lords, the Directors, I mean those that were in the secret, were so far from consulting me, or any of the ' commissioners of the Treasury, upon either of these occasions, that notwithstanding my endeavours to know the state of their cash and credit, they kept it as the greatest secret from me, and guarded more against me, than against any other man living. Nor could I ever learn from Mr. Knight, what those loans amounted to, or upon what security they were lent; notwithstanding others were let into that secret, until the accounts thereof were laid upon the table of the House of Commons. Tims, my lords, I conceive I have given you full satisfaction as to every thing that hath been laid to ray charge, or that I can even suggest against myself without the help of my prosecutors; but if any doubt remain with your lordships, in relation to my defence, or if there be the least circumstance that is not cleared up, I beseech your lordships that I may know it, before I withdraw.

* “ My lords, I now perceive your lordships do not think it necessary that I should take up any more of your time:and therefore since I have gooe through my whole charge, and your lordships are pleased to require no farther satisfaction; give me leave to say before I conclude, that notwithstanding the weight of public clamour, and the strictest and most torturing inquiry that an yone man has ever undergone, it is an unspeakable happiness that I have set my innocence in so clear a light; and it is surprizing beyond any thing that ever happened, that amdngst so many unfortunate men, to whose fate I am taeked by this Bill, and who

. 1721. — Mr. Aislabie's Defence. [692

have been examined particularly against me under all Che terrors of death and confisca-. tjon, and under all the temptations. that could be thrown in their way, there is not one of them that has accused me; but, on the conf trary, they all have entirely acquitted me.

“ This, my lords, I must- call a deliverance; this will make me bear the worst of punish-, raents without shame. 1 his is such a trial that no one ever past through before; and I heartily wish that the worst of my enemies may, in their day of trial, after such a prosecution and such an inquiry, be able to make their innocence abide the test as well as mine has done.

I have made no base submissions, no unworthy applications to any man, notwithstanding thq vanity of one of the Secret Committee. My innocence has been my only screen, und your lordships’justice is my refuge.”

The Cfanse against Mr Aislabie and the late Mr. Craggs passes the Lords.] After Mr. Aislahie was withdrawn, . the question being put, That there was sufficient ground to hare his name continued in the Directors Bill, it was carried nem. con. and so he was remanded to the Tower. *

* In the second volume of Coxe’s Walpole, p. 219, there is the following Letter from Mr. Aislabie to Mr. Robert Walpole, thanking him for his kindness, and acknowledging his own mistakes.

“ Sir; Feb. 2, 1732.

“ I am extremely sensible of your generosity, and am more ashamed of my own follies and mistakes, than any severe treatment I might deserve at your hands could make me. Since you have been so good to promise to forget what is passed *, I shall not put you in mind of it any further, than to return you my most hearty thanks. I have sent you an account of the king’s stock, with all the dividends as they were received by sir Charles Vernon, to whom the stock was transferred; I have accounted with him this morning, and he has bought the stock that was pawned to him, and paid me the balance; so that at last, 1 have raised a$ 'much as will pay the king, and shall have it ready against Monday night, if you please to let me know to whom I must pay it,

“ I have likewise sent you ai state of my own account before the judges, by which you will see ray estate is not so great as is represented, since I must take all the bad debts to myself. The trustees are both very civil to me, and I am very sensible to whom I owe it. The judges meet on Wednesday next, to proceed on my account; when the chief justice Prat will be there; if he and judge Fortescue be well inclined, I hope to make an end of if. The doubt they make at present is, whether 29,000l. public money, which was in Mr. Hawes’s bands October 1718, be part of the effects I had in other people’s hands at that time, and which I had invested in stocks some time after all the public money was paid away.

July 21. The Lords heard counsel upon the Petition of the Executors of the late Mr. Craggs, sen. and then called in and examined severally sir George Caswall, Mr. Saw bridge, 'Mr. Surman, Mr. Horn, and Mr. Huggins. It was alledged, in favour of the Petitioners, that Mr. Craggs had paid for his stock, by a note of 37,000l. from the Sword-Bbde Company, payable to Mr. Robert Knight, treasurer of the South-Sea Company:and sir George Caswall, and Mr. Sawbridge, swore that they had given such a note: but when the question was put to Mr. Sawbridge, whether the note was paid, he first answered evasively; which put the House into some heat, and the lord Trevor stood up, and said, He wondered that august assembly vvould suffer themselves to be trifled with at that rate. Hereupon, Mr. Sawbridge being ordered to answer directly upon his oath, whether the money mentioned in the note, was paid or not ? he then owned it was not; nor ever intended to be paid, when it was given:upon which the House were so thoroughly convinced of the fraudulent collusion, that they 'would hear no more witnesses, and so passed the clause relating to the late Mr. James Craggs, senior, without one negative.

The South Sea Sufferers Bill passes the House off Lords.] July 22. The Lords went through the SouthrSea Directors Bill, and put it off to the 21th. On the 25th their lordships read the said Bill the third time, and sent it down to the Commons, who readily agreed to their lordships’ Amendments.

Bill against Blasphemy and Prophaneness brought into the House of, but rejected.] During these proceedings concerning the Affairs of the South-Sea Company, the following transaction passed in the House of Lords. There was formed (at least, it was pretended so) a scandalous society at London, with the shocking name of the Hell-Fire-Club. Several persons of quality, particularly the duke of Wharton, were marked out as belonging to this club. The king being informed of their wicked proceedings, published a Proclamation (April 20) against blasphemous and scandalous clubs, declaring, he was determined to shew all marks of displeasure to any, who even lay under the suspicion of such destructive practices. He gave orders also to the officers of his honshold, to make strict inquiry, whether any of his servants were guilty of such horrid impieties. The same day this order was giveu, the earl of Nottingham, who had lately answered Mr. Whiston’s tenets about the Trinity, took this occasion to complain, in the House of Lords, of the growth of Atheism,

As this can scarce be a point, yet being matter of account, they , do not take it readily. I beg that you will assist me to make an end of this affair, in such manner as you think proper, that you may see, that by making me free, you have made me your creature, and most obliged fiiithful servant.’1

Profaheness, and Immorality. Upon this, Dr. Verney, lord Willoughby of Brooke, dean of Windsor, brought in a Bill for suppressing of Blasphemy and Profaneness. It contained several Articles, which had little relation to the practices complained of, and was chiefly designed to secure the belief of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the church of England, and restrain the liberty granted, by the laws of the former session, to the non-conformists. The substance of it was:

1. “ If any one spoke or writ against the being of God, the divinity of Jesus Christ, or-the Holy Ghost, or the doctrine of the Trinity, as set forth in the thirty-nine Articles, or the truth of the Christian religion, or the divine inspiration of the scriptures, he should, upon tonviction, be imprisoned many months, unless he should, witnin such a time, publicly renounce his error, in a form prescribed.

2. “ If any preacher in a separate congregation should deny any of the fundamental articles of the Christian religion, he should be deprived of the benefit of the Act of Toleration.

3. “ The archbishops in their provinces, and every bishop in his . diocese, should.be authorised to summon any person in holy orders, to appear before, and subscribe the declaration abovementioned, and, upon refusal, such person should be incapable to hold any ecclesiastical benefice..

4. “ The justices at their quarter-sessions, are authorised, in like manner, to summon any dissenpug preacher, and, upon his refusal to subscribe the declaration of faith, he should be deprived of the benefit of the Act of Toleration."

At the second reading of this Bill (May 2) all the lords about London being summoned to attend, the archbishop moved to have it committed. Upon which,

The Lord Onslow sqid: He was as much against blasphemy, and for promoting religion, as it is professed in the church of England, as anybody; but he could not be for any law, that was for persecution, of which nature he took this bill to be; and therefore he moved, that it might be thrown out. He was seconded by

The Duke of Wharton, who said, He was not

insensible of the common talk and opinion of the town concerning himself; and therefore he was glad of this opportunity to justify himself, by declaring, he was far frqm being a patron of blasphemy, or any enemy to religion; but, on the other hand, he could not be for this bill, because he conceived it to be repugnant to the holy Scripture. Then, taking an old family Bible out of his pocket, he quoted and read several passages of the Epistles of St. Peter and St. Paul; concluding, That the bill might be thrown out. He was supported by the duke of Argyle, and the earls of Sunderland and Ilay, the lord Townshend, and earl Cowper.

The Earl of Peterborough said, Though he was for a parliamentary king, yet he did not desire to have a parliamentary God, or a par-

895] PARL. H|ST, I.GwsmX 1721 —

1 iamentAry religion; and, if the House were for such a.one, he would go to Rome and endeavour to be* chosen a cardinal; for he, had rather sit in the conclave, than with their lordships upon those terms.

The Bishop of Peterborough, (Dr. Kennet) spoke likewise on the same side, and said, That neither himself, nor, he hoped, any of that bench, would be executioners of such a Law, which seemed to tend to the setting up of an inquisition.

On the other band, the earl of Nottingham, the lord Bathurst, - the bishops of London, Winchester, Litchfield and Coventry, and some others spoke for the bill; as did likewise the lord Trevor. One of these having said, That be verily believed, the present calamity, occasioned by the South-Sea project, was a judgment of God am the blasphemy and profaneness the nation was guilty of!

The Lqrd Onslow replied, That noble peer must then hake been a. great sinner; for he heard, he haddost considerably by the South-Sea. '

After some other speeches, the Bill was put off to a long day, by a majority of CO voices against 31.

The Commons* Address to the King on pre-

senting the Resolutionsfor restoring the Public Credit.] July 26. The Commons presented the following Address to the King representing the state of the Public Credit, and the Re-sojutions thereto relating:

4e When we first entered upon the consideration of this extensive and perplexed affair, we thought it most advisable to leave every man’s property to be determined by due course of law; and were of opinion. That no relief or abatement could properly be prescribed, or given, but from the South Sea Company: but the discontents of the people daily increasing, and the uncertain and doubtful events that threatened very great and valuable properties, creating such infinite anxieties and dissatisfaction, as had a most fatal and general influence upon all public and private credit, the interposition of parliament became unavoidable: and we found ourselves under a necessity of resuming the consideration of this nice and intricate matter;

Vou VU.

and to endeavour to remove, as far as possible, the chief and greatest, inconveniences.

* The great dithculty in remedying these mischiefs seemed to arise from the several contending interests, engaged in the South Sea Company, which made it impossible to give relief to some, but at the expence of others: and, as all the new proprietors, as well those concerned in the public funds, as the other adventurers, were equally imposed upon by the artifices of the late Directors, and equally drawn in by their own too great credulity, and desire of gain; to have discharged any particular set, had been not only an injustice to the .rest, but, by dissolving the whole system, had involved them in utter ruin; which made a distribution of losses, and some abatement to all, absolutely necessary: it was indeed very much to be wished that such ease could have been given to the proprietors of the public debts, as would have made their property as valuable to them as they had enjoyed it for many years: but, as they had voluntarily consented to take stock, at. some rate or other, even at the time when they saw the stock raised to the highest pitch; the giving stock at one and the same price to them, and all others that were most immediately concerned, makes the provision as just and equitable as the nature of the thing will admit; it being impracticable so far to reconcile the different interests in ihisgeneral concern, as to make the conditions of those equal, that had engaged themselves at different rates* and upon Unequal terms.

44 The great and principal mischief arose from several concurring circumstances; froni the hard terms of most of the proprietors, occasioned by the high prices at which they had purchased stock; or the excessive rates at which as well the proprietors of public debts as the money-subscribers, had obliged themselves to take stock:from the demand of above seven millions payable to the public, which could only be raised out of the properties of those that were already too great sufferer.?, and which rendered the Company incapable of giving them any further ease or relief; from the disputes and contests at law, which were preparing to be carried on, not only between the Company and the subscribers of the redeemable funds, but between infinite numbers of private persons engaged in contracts for the sale and purchase of stock, and Subscriptions; from the impossibility of the money-subscribers making any further payments; from the great loss the Company had sustained, by the late Directors having lent out above eleven millions of the Company’s money, without any, or without sufficient, security; and from the very jittle prospect of recovering any considerable part thereof, without which it was impossible for the Company to comply with the demand of the public, but at the infinite expence, and insupportable loss, of all their adventurers; which must have proved destructive to the trade and credit of the kingdom.

“ These considenttioDS induced us to come 1 3 M

' Ogle,

S9D] PARL. HISTORY, 7 George L1721Kings Speech on the [900:

to the foregoing resolutions; being, as we conceive, the most proper means to enable the Company to give relief to such of their proprietors as most wanted and deserved it; to put aq end to all disputes at law; and to fix, settle, and ascertain, the several properties and interests of all persons concerned with the South-Sea Company-; to deliver infinite numbers of your majesty’s good subjects from the apprehensions of vexatious law-suits and prosecutions; and from the further demand of such excessive sums of paoney as roust sink and depress all public and private credit.

“ And, as the greatest mischiefs, which we now so justly complain of, have arisen from the, unwarrantable methods used by the late Directors of the South-Sea Company, in selling and disposing of such part of their increased capital stock as belonged to the Company; to remove such a foundation of Stockjobbing, and to prevent the like fatal consequences for the future, we thought it necessary to take care, that all the increased capital stock belonging to the Company, which, after the proposed distribution is made, shall remain undisposed o& be divided among all the proprietors of the said Company, in proportion to their several and respective interests.

“ These Resolutions, if passed into a law, and duly put in execution, we humbly hope, will tend very much to the re-establishing of public credit; to the quieting of the minds of your majesty’s subjects; and contribute to the ease and relief of great numbers, though not sufficient to give satisfaction to, or repair the Jpsses of, all that are unhappily involved in the present calamity.

“ But as the ancient usage, and established rules, of parliament, make it impracticable for Us to prepare bills for the royal assent, during the present session of parliament, for some of the purposes contained in our Resolutions; we have humbly presumed to lay the same before your majesty, for your royal consideration; not doubting but that your majesty will, outof your great wisdom, and accustomed grace and goodness to your people, as soon as the public and private bills, now depending in parliament, shall be dispatched, give us an early opportunity of perfecting this great and necessary work."

The Kings Answer.} T° the above Address his majesty returned this Answer:

Gentlemen;

uI have such an intire confidence in this parliament’s duty and affection to me, and their xeal for the public service, that! shall very readily comply with what you desire; and will soon give you an opportunity of doing what you propose for settling and establishing the credit and quiet of the kingdom.”

Civil List Bill to his majesty, made the following Speech:

“ Most Gracious Sovereign;

“ Your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great Britain in par-> liament assembled, -being sensible of the great, debt upon the Civil List, occasioned by the Calamity of the times, which, has disabled the two companies of assurance to make good the money which they had stipulated to pay to the crown, which, if it had been insisted on, would have occasioned the ruin of many families, and would, consequently have been a great obstruction to trade; and your majesty having always had so much goodness, as rather to wave your own right, than to exact it, to the prejudice of your faithful subjects; we have, therefore, to make good that loss given your majesty, and we humbly prajLtbat your majesty would be graciously pleased to accept of, six-pence in the pounds to be paid out of the Civil List, from your faithful Commons, who will be always ready to support your majesty and your government.”

After which the Royal Assent was given to' an Act, ‘ For raising money upon the estate ^

‘ of the late Sub-Governor, Deputy-Governor, ' t Directors, Cashier, Deputy-Cashier, and Accomptant of the South-Sea Company, and of

* John Aislabie, esq. and likewise of James

* the said Company; and for disabling such of the said persons as, are living, to hold any ‘ office or place of trust under the crown, qr to '

* sinor vote in parliament for the future; and

* for other purposes in the said Act expressed and to five other Bills. And then the Lord Chancellor prorogued the parliament to the 31st.

The Kings Speech on the State of the Public Credit.] July 31. The King came to the House of Peers, when the Lord Chancellor, by his majesty’s command, delivered the following Speech to both Houses:

u My Lords and Gentlemen,

“ The occasion of my calling you together again so suddenly, is to give you an opportunity of resuming the consideration of the State of Public Credit.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons,

“ The progress that you made in this affair during the last session, laid such a foundation of this necessary work, that the world is fully apprised of what is reasonably to be hoped for at this present conjuncture.

“ My Lords and Gentlemen, _ '

“I must recommend to you all possible dispatch, and am persuaded that at this season of the year, your deliberation will be confined td what is absolutely necessary upon this extraqr-, dinary occasion.”

A Bill for restoring the Public Credit, brought in.T A Bill being ordered to be brought in upon the said Resolutions, the same was presented accordingly, the next da ^, by Mr. Lowndes, with the title of, ‘ A bill for making several provisions to restore the Public Cre-1 (lit, which suffers by the Frauds and Misma-

A tumultuous Concourse of the Annuitants assemble in the Lobby of the House of .]

In the mean time, there appeared in the Lobby of the House of Commons, and in the places adjacent, several hundreds of the proprietors of the Short Annuities, and other redeemable public debts, of both sexes, who demanded justice of the members as they went into the House, and put into their hands a Paper with these written words, ‘ Pray do justice to

* the Annuitants, who lent their money on

* Parliamentary Security/* The multitude

* The following printed Letter was also delivered to the members as they entered the House:

A Letter to a Member of Parliament; wherein the Unreasonableness and Improbability of binding down the Redeemables, is fully demonstrated.

. uSir; , 1 u The great question debated among us with- out doors, is, whether the parliament will bind down the redeemable^ absolutely to the price of 300/. and, in consideration of this reduction, deprive them of the right they have to contest the validity of their subscription at law? I shall give you'my reasons for the negative part of this question, in as few words as I can.

* But before I mention them, I will just take notice by the way, that the reduction to 800/. is such an one, as the, redeemables will never voluntarily accept of. For it not only bears no proportion to the favour or relief .which is intended towards the rest of the unhappy sufferers by this scheme, but carries along with it the ruin and destruction of these proprietors and their families, and will certainly introduce a new scene of misery and poverty.

<l The redeemables have reason to think themselves intitled to as much favour as any others: They are part of the ancient creditors of the government. The honour and justice of the government was engaged for the just payment of their debts; and even the South-Sea Act itself no otherwise enabled the Company to take in their debts, than with regard to justice and public faith.

“ But it is universally admitted, that though » their debts should proveto have been taken in, according to the strict letter of that law (which is now the point in. controversy; ) yet, it is certain, the Company have not acted with regard to justice and public faith, in the manner of taking them in; and therefore, to be sure, they fre as much intitled to the favourable relief of the parliament, as the members of that Company, which have cheated them.

“ As to the money-subscribers; admitting that they also Ijave been abused and deluded

were particularly rude to Mr. Comptroller, tearing part of his coat as he passed by; upon which the House being informed, that a crowd of people were got together in a tumultuous and riotous mariner, in the lobby and passages to this House, it was ordered, “ That the Justices of Peace for the city of Westminster, do immediately attend this House, and bring the, constables with them.* '

Debate bn the Petition of the Annuitants*] In the mean time, sir John Ward presented to the House a Petition and Representation of the Proprietors of the Redeemable Funds, on behalf of themselves, and all others, pretended to be taken into the South-Sea Company, setting forth, “That they had lent their money upon

by the Company, yet still they have no plea for favour which may not be urged with much greater strength in behalf of the redeemables;

I mean, with relation to the government. For the money subscribers engaged on their own heads voluntarily, and, I may say, wantonly too: they had no occasion to engage with the Company at all; but the redeemables came in under the persuasion, and by invitation of an act of parliament. So that the first of these had only the faith of the Company to depend upon; the others had the faith of the'Company and parliament too. The money subscribers engaged with a view to the advantages which might arise and be made from a subsequent contract with the government-creditors; but the redeemables were brought in by the advantages arising from an actual contract made between the Company and the money-subscribers. And would it not be very strange, if it should prove more prudent to have trusted the Company alone, than to have relied on the faith of the Company and that of the parliament added to it ?. Or more advantageous tp have made a bargain for a future contingency, than for a reality ?

“ I own, there is somewhat of obligation which arises from placing a confidence in another, and such merit the money-subscribers mayjclaim, with regard to the Company; but what superior merit they can pretend to with regard to the parliament, is a secret. Sure I am, they can never plead a greater merit towards the government, thau the government-creditors themselves.

“ With regard to' the Company, the money subscribers plead the merit of having drawn in others. And for this signal piece of service, the Company might reasonably enough treat them with distinguishing marks of favour, and think themselves obliged to take care, that they should not be greater losers, than those who had been decoyed by them. But how this way of reasoning should influence the parliament, is not to be explained or understood, unless it should be also affirmed, that it was an acceptable service to the parliament, to have their creditors cheated.

“ No man in his senses can doubt, hut that

parliamentary security; that having been unwarily drawn in to subscribe their effects into the South-Sea Company, by the artifices of the late Directors, the honourable House of Commons, in February, had thought fit to leave the

the releasing the money subscribers from all their subsequent payments, and allowing them stock atthe rate of 300/. per cent, for what has been actually paid in, is a much greater relief to the money-subscribers, than the reducing the redeemables to 300/. is to them.

The second money-subscribers contracted to pay 400/. and the third and fourth 1,000l. for 100/. South Sea Stock, but were afterwards reduced to 400/. They of the second subscription paid down 80/. the third 100/. and the fourth 200/. in part of their contract. Now, supposing South-Sea stock to be capable of being made worth 150/. per cent, (which, I believe ak the art of man can never make it intrinsically worth) and you may easily see the great disproportion there is between the redeemables, and the worst of the money subscribers.

* The fourth money-subscriber, out of his money which he Contracted to pay for 100/. stock is to retain 200/. in his podkfet, to have stock at the rat- of 300/. per cent, for the Other 200/. viz. 73/. 6s. 8d. which, at 150/. per cent, makes 110/. so that he loses, upon the whole of his contract, 90/. But the redeemable subscriber, has paid down all his 400/. according to his supposed contract, and is not to have one farthing remitted to him; but to take stock at the rate of 300/. for the whole, viz. 146/. 13s. 4 d.value 220/. So that upon the whole of his bargain, he is to lose 180/. Let any man judge now, whether this is equal. If the people must be made to believe, that this division of loss between the money subscribers and redeemables, is equal, it must be made ap- pear, that 180/. is no more than 90/.

“ As to th'e irredeemables, who are the other part of the government creditors; though it is certain, that they also have been greatly abused by the Company, by having been taken in at an extravagant high price; yet the number of years purchase allowed to them, greatly takes off from the extravagancy of the price at which they were taken in, and reduces their loss to a much lower ‘proportion than that of the redeemables; as may be seen by every calculation which has been made of this subject.

• “ But perhaps you will say, as I have often heard it said, That if the redeemables are bound in law, they are intitled to no relief:but ought to be thankful for any, and consequently for their reduction to 300/.

“ To this I answer, that the reduction to 300/. is so far from being a relief to the redeemables, that it had been much better for them to have stood at 400/. provided all the rest of the contractors were obliged to stand to their contracts. And surely, this is nothing but justice; for it is certain, the contracts made by them were as binding and firm, as

validity, or invalidity of their subscriptions, to be determined by the common law: But being informed, that by the Bill now depending, they were tied down to take South-Sea stock at 300/. they therefore prayed that they might be heard

that which is pretended to have been made by the redeemables:And if so, what sort of favour is this, that is shewn to the redeemables, when the reduction proposed; being accompanied by a much more favourable reduction to every one else, really puts them in a worse condition, than if th6re had been no reduction at all ? ' ,

“ Is this a favour which will induce the redeemables to part with a legal right of controverting their subscription ? A controversy wherein they have all the reason in the world to hope for success, and which, if it is determined in their favour, will discharge their whole estates, and deliver them intirely from the jaws of their greedy oppressors.

“ No, Sir, You may depend upon it, the redeemables are not so very silly as this comes to. They know their interest better than to close on such unequal terms. Nothing but force will ever prevail upon them to acquiesce under such conditions.

“ And now I come to the business I first proposed, viz. To offer you my reasons for believing that the parliament will not force them to accept of these terms. For,

“ If the Parliament should bind down the redeemables absolutely to the terms of 300/. without suffering them to contest the validity of their subscription, the parliament must be supposed to know either that the pretended subscription is binding in law, and such as they cannot get loose from; or else, must resolve to piece out the legality of that subscription by the interposition of mere power.

“ That the parliament know the pretended subscription is binding in law, is what any man may safely deny:nay, so far are they from knowing this, that it does not appear, that they have ever yet made an inquiry alter those necessary facts, upon which only such a knowledge can be founded.

“ The parliament has been told indeed, that 13, 985, 425/. of the redeemables have been taken into the South-Sea Stock. This has been" represented to them, as they say^in the late ingrafting act. But, by whom were they told this ? Why, by the late directors, men who were not only interested in the question, but such as the parliament knows to be knaves, land whose estates they are now confiscating for their knaveries.

“ By a former act passed in this sessions, the parliament, upon a view of these mens conduct in other respects, declared, that under pretence of the South-Sea Act, they had contrived and carried on many fraudulent and indirect practices, contrary to the intention of the vsaid Act:and upon this account, as it was very natural, the parliament suspended their belief concerning the legality of taking in the

907] PAUL. HISTORY, 6 Glows* 1.1721 . — Petition Amuttmt* £90&

by themselves, or then* counsel, against (be said

bill.”

After (be reading of this Petition, the sane was ordered to lie on the table, and then the

Bill to restore Public Credit/' &e. was read

Redeemables; justly suspecting, that those men who had acted contrary to the iotension of that act in some respects might also have, acted contrary to it m others: they very wisely, therefore, resolved to leave the redeemables to the law to try this point; and have provided, by a clause in the said ingrafting act, that if the redeemables obtain a decree or judgment in their favour, that in such case, they shall not be esteemed members of the South-Sea, or any other company, on account o! such subscriptions.

* Now can any man, after all this, be so absurd as to think, that what the parliament refused to do in February, they will do in July ? Do not all the reasons that were alledged against binding down the redeemables, hold as strong now, as they did few months ago - And can it be imagined, that the same parliament which came to a resolution not to interpose in this matter, when no suits were actually commenced, should all on a sudden resolve to interpose now they are, and thereby deprive the " redeemables of those hopes which they themselves encouraged, and which the redeemables have prosecuted with so much trouble and expence i What is this but making the parliament to speak like the oracles of old, or rather mere fallaciously, to tell the redeemables, they would leave them the free use of the laws, provided they would not make use of them ?

“ Had not self-interest blinded men to the greatest degree in the world, they would never desire that the parliament should in any case suspend the regular administration of justice, and interrupt the common course of the laws. This is a thing every true Englishman ought rather to pray against, and he exceeding j ealous and fearful of: It is opening a wide gap in our constitution. Hitherto it has beenjlooked upon, that the interpretation and execution of laws when made, did as properly belong to Westminster-Hall, as the making them to the parliament:and the alteration of such a fundamental, whatever particular-jobs it may serve at - present, cannot but be attended with very fatal consequences, if not with the dissolution of this ancient and free government.

But to suppose, that the parliament should take so extraordinary, unprecedented, unparliamentary a step, to tie up men from the free use of the law, only in order to oppress their own innocent creditors, and to piece out the legality of a most unrighteous and barbarous . contract; at the best, is to suppose a parliament speaking in this wise: Whereas it may be doubted, whether the wicked artifices used by the late South-Sea Directors, to cheat eud defraud the redeemables, are sufficient in law for that purpose; and the proprietors of those debts have commenced suits in the ordinary

the second time, find committed to a Committee of the whole House. This done.

Sir John Ward stood up, and spoke in favour of the petitioners, urging the justice of hearing them, either by themselves, or their counsel, in

course of justice to vindicate themselves irons the said intended oppression, and may thereby happily free themselves from the same; therefore be it enacted, That all such suits shall cease: and be k declared, that the said redeemables are cheated, and shall be cheated effectually, and without retrieve! and die estates whereof they are, by the abthority of this present parliament, declared to be cheated, shall be distributed for the benefit of those who have contrived, promoted and assisted in carrying on the said cheat.

“ This, Sir, I can assure you, is the true English of what some among us, without doors, would have the parliament say: but, I am persuaded, they never will say it: such notions as these, canbe entertained by none but such as are enemies to the honour and justice of a British parliament.

“ If you ask these sort of men, Why the parliament should interpose to bind up the laws whiph they never did before; They immediately answer you, that the exigency of affairs requires it. If the South-Sea Company, say they, is liable to law-suits, public credit can never be established.

“ If by public credit these men mean what they ought to mean, the credit of the government and community; there cannot be a more senseless proposition than this: for the credit of the government must, in the nature of the thing, be founded on the supposed honesty and justice of the government; on its disposition to support and maintain the legal rights'of its creditors.

“ Men most willingly trust those, for whose faith and honesty they have the best security. Take away any part of that security which the creditor has for the re-payment of his debt, and you necessarily lessen your own credit, as well as his security:take away the law, which is both the measure and security of all property, and no man will ever part with his money out of his own possession, because be has no way left to recover it but by force:let it be but once determined, that there is no law against a Company, that whatever they get possession of, though never so illegally, they shall bold and retain, and none but fools wiU trust such a Company for the future.

“ But the truth is, that these men by public credit and the establishment of it, mean nothing else but the raising the value of South-Sea Stock, and measure the increase of credit only by the present increase of their own estates; whether by wrong or right, is no part of their concern, and because it is for their present interest, that the redeemables should continue part of the, South-Sea Stock, and a law-suit between the Compaoy mid them, may, in all human probability, disappoint their hopes, and

order to their being relieved, And he was seconded by sir Gilbert Heathcote. Here-upon

Mr. Robert Walpole said, He did not see hpw the petitioners could be relieved; that the Resolutions, pursuant to which this hill was brought in, had been laid before, and approved by the king and council, and had also Been agreed to by a great majority of the House before the last short prorogation; and that they had given their word of honour to the members that were gone into the country, that they would not alter a tittle in them; and as he coukt not see any thing that couKl be done for the petitioners, he therefore moved for adjourning the debate, and desired that that question might be put as a previous one. This was opposed by

Mr. Brodrick, who said. He wondered what

that gentleman meant by desiring to have such a question put, before the question for taking the Petition into consideration; which; he thought, would look as if they could not answer the allegations contained in the said Petition; and therefore he moved that they* might go upon the debate of it. He was seconded by Samuel Sandy s, esq. who spoke strenuously in favour of the petitioners; -hut the court party insisting upon Mr. Walpole's motion, the question for adjourr xng was put, and carried by a majority of 78 voices against 29.

vBy this time four of the Justices of the Peace for the city of Westminster attending, according to order, they were called in, and being at the bar, Mr. Speaker acquainted them, That the House was informed that there was a- great crowd of riotous people in the lobby and passages leading to this House, and that he was commanded by the House to direct them, the said Justices; to go and disperse the said riotous crowd, and to take care to prevent the like riots for the future. Hereupon the four Justices, attended by five or six constables, desired {he petitioners to clear the lobby and passages; and upon their refusal, caused the Proclamation against Rioters to he twice read, declaring to them, that if they continued there till the

evince the contrary; therefore, they desire the course of 'the law should be stopped. Hence arises this fear of the law and law-suits: the law is au enemy to villany and oppression. But what these men call public credit, is, it seems only to be supported by them, and consequent? ly must be built on the destruction of the law, their opposite. *

“ But though it should be granted these men, that self-interest is the sole principle of action in a wise man (and many such moralists or wise men you may meet with in every coffeehouse) yet if, according to the Poet's definition of wisdom, ‘ Istuc est sapere, non quod ante pedes

* niodo est videre, sed etiam iHa quaefutura sunt

third reading, they should incur the penalties of the act. Hereupon they thought fit to disperse; but as th^y went away, could not forbear venting their resentments, some saying,

* That they came as peaceable subjects and ‘ citizens, to represent their grievances, and did

* not expect to be used like a mob, and

* scoundrelsand the rudest telling the mem* hers, You first pick our pockets, and, then

* send us to gaol for complaining. '

The Bill for restoring the Public Credit passed.} Aug. 4. The Commons, in a Committee of the whole House, considered of the ‘ Bill to restore Public Credit; ' and the first question that occasioned any debate was, a| what price the subscribers upon the second subscription should be obliged to take South-Sea stock ? Some were for 263/. and others for 203/. and after several speeches (by Mr. Horatio Walpole, Mr. Yonge, Mr. Robert.Walpole, Mr. Sloper, Mr. Broderick, Mr. Lowndes, Mr. Lowther, Mr. Harsley, Mr. Milner, and sir Johd Kyles) it was agreed without dividing, that the said subscribers should take stock at 203/.

The next question was, whether brokers, of such as had acted as brokers for brokeridge, who had borrowed money of the South-Sea Company upon stock, or subscription-receipts, should, like the other borrowers, be discharged from all farther demands, by .paying to the cashier of the said Company ten per cent, of the money borrowed ? But after some debate^ it was carried by 62 votes against 42, that the said brokers should be excepted, and a olauso was added to the bill, to oblige them to pay the whole money borrowed.

After this sir Thomas Crosse declared, that upon looking over the South-Sea books, ht found<that many of the borrowers bad not given any security for the money borrowed, for three months, or thereabouts, after the money lent: upon which the question was put, and carried without a division, that all those who had borrowed money of the Company, and had not given security, by transferring stock, or subscription receipts, fourteen days after the money

and taken from any of their fellow subjects. For when the precedent of suspending the law is once introduced, whose turn it may be to suffer next, no man knows. These men, for the sake of an immediate advantage, would rejoice, it seems, in an act of parliament which should distress their brethren, and destroy their property; but, I am satisfied, such rejoicing would not last long; the pleasure, as it is a barbarous one, would also be a short-lived one. For the same means which are made use of to plunder these men to day maybe made use of to plunder them to morrow. And if we should be so unhappy to fall into the hands of such a parliament as these mew wish for; a parliament of the same narrow and self-interested principles with themselves; this one precedent would be alledged in justification of a Gejtebal Spvng»»” > '

911] PARL. HIST. 8 George I. 1721. — The King's Speech on Opening the Session. [919

lent, should be obliged to pay the whole money. Several other amendments were made to the bill, which being reported the next day to the House by Mr. Farrer, some of them were agreed to; .but when they came to that relating to the brokers, the same occasioned a considerable debate. Mr. Robert Walpole among the rest expressed his apprehensions, that obliging the brokers tp repay the whole money they had borrowed, might rather be detrimental, than advantageous to public credit, and occasion the fall of the South-Sea stock, which wds now upon the rise; and that the brokers, to excuse themselves, might probably accuse others, which would afford fresh matter of complaint and dispute, therefore he moved that the said clause be left out of the bill. He was answered by general Ross and Mr. Sloper; but upon the question being put, it was carried by a great majority, that the brokers should only be excepted from the clause relating to the borrowers; that is to say, that they should not be obliged to repay the whole money by them borrowed; nor yet be discharged from farther demands, by paying ten per cent, of the money borrowed; but be left either to compound with the South-Sea Company, or to be sued at common law. The other amendment, relating to the borrowers, who had not transferred their stock, or subscription-receiptsin due time, was also left out of the bill.

Aug. 7. The said Bill was read the third time, passed, and sent up to the Lords; after which, the Commons adjourned to the 10th, on which day the ?ill was passed by the Lords, and received the Royal Assent.

The King's Speech at the Close of the Session.] August 10. The King came to the House of Peers, and the Commons being sent for up, and attending, the Lord Chancellor, by his majesty's command, read the following Speech to both Houses:

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

* I am glad that the business of this and the former session is at length brought to such a period, that I have now an opportunity of giving yqu some recess, after the great pains you have taken in the service of the public.

“ The common calamity, occasioned by the wicked execution of the South-Sea scheme, was become so very great before your meeting, that the providing proper remedies .for it was very difficult: But it is a great comfort to me, to observe, that Public Credit now begins to recover; which gives me the greatest hopes that it will be entirely restored, when all the provisions you have made for that end, shall be duly put in execution.

“ I have great compassion far the sufferings of the innocent, and a just indignation against the guilty; and have readily given my assent to such bills as you have presented to me, for punishing the authors of our late misfortunes, and for obtaining the restitution and satisfaction due to those who have been injured by theraa iu such £

manner as you judged proper. I was at the same time, willing and desirous, by my free and general pardon, to give ease and quiet to the. rest of my subjects, many of whom may, in such a general infatuation, have been unwarily drawn in to transgress the laws.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons,

“ I return you my hearty thanks for the supplies you have granted for the current service of this year; and particularly for your enabling me to discharge the debts and arrears on the Civil List, and to make good the engagements I was under for procuring peace in the North, which in all probability, will now very soon be concluded. .. These instances of your faithful endeavours to support the honour apd dignity of the crown, at home and abroad, are fresh marks of your zeal and affection to my person and government.

* c My Lords and Gentlemen; u I take this opportunity of acquainting you, that we have renewed all our treaties of commerce with Spain, upon the same foot, as they were settled before the.late war; which must necessarily prove an immediate and valuable advantage to the trade and manufactures of this kingdom.

“ 1 earnestly recommend to you all, in your several stations, to suppress profaneness and immorality, and to preserve the peace and quiet of the kingdom.

“ You are all sensible, that the discontents occasioned by the great losses that many of my subjects have sustained, have been industriously raised and inflamed by malicious and seditious libels; but I make no doubt, but that, by your prudent conduct in your several count tries, all the enemies of my government, who flattered themselves they should be able to take advantage from oar misfortunes, and blow up the sufferings of my people into popular discontent and disaffection, will be disappointed in their wicked designs and expectations.* ^

And then the Lord Chancellor prorogued the Parliament to the 19th day of October.

SEVENTH AND LAST SESSION OF THE FIFTH PARLIAMENT OF GREAT BRITAIN.

The King's Speech on Opening the Session.] October 19. The Parliament being met, the King came to the House of Peers, and the. Commons attending, his Majesty, by the mouth of the Lord High Chancellor, made the following Speech to both Houses:

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

* I acquainted you, when we parted last, with our having renewed all our Treaties of Commerce yvith Spain; since which, peace is happily restored in the North, by the conclusion of the treaty between the Czar and the king of Sweden; and by that which I have made with the Moors, a great number of iuy subjects are delivered from slavery; and all such of them as Ntrade to those parts of the

-Si's] PAUL. HISTORY, 8 GbobcbI. 1721. — of Thanks. [914

world, are, for the future, secured from falling1 voder that dreadful calamity.

“ In this situation ef affairs we should be extremely wanting to ourselves, if we neglected to improve the favourable opportunity, which this general tranquillity gives us, of extending our commerce, upon which the riches and grandeur of this nation chiefly depend. It is very obvious, that nothing would more conduce to the obtaining so public a good, than to make the exportation of our own manufactures, and the importation of the commodities used in the manufacturing of them, as practicable and easy as may be; by this means, the balance of trade may be preserved in our favour, our navigation increased, and greater numbers of our poor employed.

u I must therefore recommend it to you. Gentlemen of the House of Commons, to consider how far the Duties upon these branches may be taken off, and replaced, without any violation of public faith, or laying any new burthen upon my people. And I promise myself, thht by a due consideration of this matter, the produce of those duties, compared with the infinite, advantages that will accrue to the kingdom by their being takeu off, will be found so inconsiderable, as to leave little room for any difficulties or objections.

“ The supplying ourselves with Naval Stores, upon terras the most easy and least precarious, seems highly to deserve the care and attention of parliament. Our Plantations in America naturally abound with most of the proper materials for this necessary and essential part of our trade and maritime strength; and if, by due encouragement, we could be furnished from thence with those naval stores, which we are now obliged to purchase, and bring from foreign countries, it would not only greatly contributedo the riches, influence, and power of this nation, but, by employing our own colonies in this useful and advantageous service, divert them from setting up, and carrying on manufactures which directly interfere with those of Great-Britain.

“ Gentlemen'of the House of Commons;

u It will be a great pleasure to me, if, in raising the Supplies of this year, it may be so ordered, that my people may reap some immediate benefit from the present circumstances of affairs abroad. I have ordered Estimates to l?e prepared for the service of the ensuing year, and likewise an Account of the Debts of the Navy, to be laid before you. You cannot but be sensible of thfe ill consequences that arise from such a .large debt remaining unprovided for; and that as long as the Navy and Victualling Bills are at a very high discount, they do Hot only affect all other public credit, but greatly increase the charge and expence of the current service. It is therefore very much to be wished, that you could find a method of discharging this part of the National Debt, which, of all others, is the most heavy and burthen-fome, and by that means have it in your power $0 ease your country of seme part of the Taxes, Vet.. VII,

which from an absolute necessity, they have been obliged to pay.

“. My Lords and. Gentlemen;

uThe unspeakable misery aod desolation that has of late raged, in some parts of Europe *, cannot but be a sufficient warning to us, to use all possible precautions to prevent the contagion from being brought in among us s or if these kingdoms should be visited with such, a fatal calamity, to be in a condition, with the blessing of God, to stop its farther progress. And as all other provisions will be altogether vain and fruitless, if the abominable practice of running of goods he not, at once, totally suppressed, I most earnestly recommend to you, to let no other consideration stand in competition with a due care of preserving so many thousand lives.

“ The several affairs which I have mentioned to you, being of the highest and most immediate concern to the whole kingdom, I doubt not but you will enter into the consideration of them with that temper, unanimity, and dispatch, that the necessity and importance o£ them require.”

The LorddAddress of Thanks."] The Lords, on the motion of lord Teynham, agreed to the following Address:

“Most Gracious Sovereign;

“ We your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in parliament assembled, beg leave to return yous majesty our most hearty Thanks for your majesty’s most gracious Speech from the throne; and for the great compassion you have shewn to such of your subjects, as have had the mis* fortune to fall info the hands of the Moors* And. we do at the same time congratulate your majesty, upon the success1 of your endeavour! for restoring the general tranquillity of Europe *

, And we assure your majesty, That, as the several particulars you, have been, pleased to mention to us, are instances of the greatest affection to your people; and the tenderest concern for their interest and security, so we will on our part consider, with all temper* unanimity, and dispatch, what your majesty baa been pleased to lay before us; and will do all in our power towards attaining the great and good ends, which your majesty has so gram-

On this occasion a proclamation wail published, forbidding any person to come into England from any part of France, between tho bay of Biscay vand Dunkirk, without certificates of health.

oufily recommended to. us, in favour of the trade, ease and safety of your people.”

The King's Answer.] To this the King made the following Answer:; '

“ My Lords; u I thank you for this loyal and dutiful Ad-, dress. The seal you express for my person and government, and for the interest ana happiness of my people, gives me great satisfaction.”

The Commons' Address of .] The

Commons being returned to their House, sir George Oxenden moved for an Address of ^Thanks, which was unanimously agreed to.

October 20. Sir George Oxenden, chairman of the Committee appointed to draw up the said Address, reported the same to the House, and upon the Speaker’s putting the question. Whether this should pass as the Address of the House ? Mr. Arthur Moore saitf. He thought the expressions relating to the preventing running of goods were too general; and that, in his opinion, the best way to prevent that pernicious practice, was to take off some of the high duties, whereby the temptation to smuggling would very much abate; since people would not think it worth their while to run great hazards for a small gam. (And besides, if the duties were lessened, the. importation, in all probability, would increase proportionably; so that the customs might amount to as much, with a smaller duty, as they do at present; and if they did not, ways might be found to make up the deficiency to the crown. Nothing of moment was offered against this Speech; but, the House not thinking it proper to enter then upon the consideration of that matter, the Address, as it had been drawn up, was approved, and the next day presented to the King by the whole House, as follows;

“ Most gracious Sovereign; u We your majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great-Britain in parliament assembled, beg leave to return your majesty our unfeigned Thanks for your most gracious Speech from the throne.

u We congratulate your majesty upon the success that has attended your unwearied application for restoring tranquillity to Europe, for securing our commerce by treaties, and for releasing great numbers of your subjects from slavery among the Moors; and for delivering the trading part of the nation from the apprehensions of tire like calamity for the future; which are so, many instances of ydur majesty’s goodness, in which all your subjects are so nearly concerned, that we are no less bound ky interest, than led by inclination and duty, most, thankfully to acknowledge these happy effects of your majesty’s care for your people.

“ Tour majesty’s recommending to us to improve the general tranquillity abroad, towards. extending aid enlarging our commerce, ie an additional proof, how much ypur majesty has the reel interest of Great-Britain at heart, inahyourcoumeh — ri undertakings.

“ Xeur Commons are. thoroughly sensible '

that our poor cannot he sufficiently employed, nor the balance of- trade be long preserved ii* our favour, while such duties are continued, at either clog the exportation of our own manufactures, or render the manufacturing of then at home less easy and practicable; and they) will most cheerfully apply themselves to consider how far such duties can be taken off and replaced without laying any new burthen on, your people, or violating the public faith; having great reason to. promise themselves, than the free circulation of trade, which must naturally succeed upon the taking off this pressure^ will, in a. short space of time, compensate any diminution of the customs, which this alteration, may occasion for the present.

* < And since the trade, navigation, and safety of this nation must remain, in some measure,

; precarious, as long as we are under the necessity of purchasing and importing all oar navat stores from foreign countries, your majesty’* most faithful Commons will do their utmost endeavours, that this important and beneficial branch of trade may be supplied from your majesty’s plantations in America, and thereby divert our colonies from setting up manufactures, . which directly interfere with those of their mother-country. '

“ Your majesty’s tender concern to have th*> Supplies of this session so ordered, that your subjects may be among the earliest in reaping, the happy effects of the general tranquillity abroad, cannot fail of exciting in your faithful Commons a desire of making suitable returns, by proceeding, with all alacrity, to grant th*J ifecessary Supplies for the current service of the year, and for discharging the .heavy Deb* of the Navy: And we find ourselves engaged, by all the ties of duty and interest, to second your majesty’s provident intentions, for sup *, pressing the infamous and pernicious practice of running goods; which, besides that it defrauds the public revenues and discourages th*-honest trader, may, at this juncture, imianger-the health and lives of many thousands of your majesty’s innocent subjects.

4tThe several points which your majesty ha*' been graciously pleased to recommend to us, carry in them such evident marks of your majesty’s paternal and most affectionate concern for your people, and are of such lasting consequence to the welfare and safety of this nation, that we should be inexcusable, if we did not, by a ready concurrence on our parts, do all in our power to render these your majesty’s most gracious purposes effectual; and proceed in th* consideration of them with such temper, unanimity, and dispatch, as may fully answer your majesty’s expectations, and defeat the designs of those who hope for any other contention* amongst us, but of zeal and affection toward* your majesty’s sacred personam! government.”

The King's Answer.] To which the King, gave this Answer i

“ Gentlemen;

Debate in the Commons on the Supply.'] October 27. The Commons, in a grand committee, considered of the Supply to be granted to his majesty; and, in the first place, went ' upon the State of the Debt of the Navy, as it tood on the SOth of September 1721, which amounted to about 1, 700,0001. Hereupon

Mr. Freeman stood up, and with some Warmth animadverted Upon the persons concerned in that part of the administration, saying, - among other things, It was matter of wonder; how so great a debt could be incurred, when the parliament had provided for what bad been desired upon that head. He was seconded by

Mi*. Ship pen, who hinted, That such extraordinary expences could not be for the immediate service of Great-Britain, but in all probability, for the preservation of some foreign acquisitions.

Mr. PlummerAnswered them both in a very

smart speech. Upon which

Sir Joseph Jekyll said. That he was not against providing for any just public debt; but that, in his opinion, they could not answer it, either to themselves, or those they bad the honour to represent, if they gave away the nation’s money blindfold; and therefore he de-(aired, that the House might be informed, how so great a debt had been contracted? I’o this

Mr. R. Walpole replied, Nothing in the world was more reasonable; and therefore he backed the motion for having a particular Account of that Debt laid before the House; but, In the mean time, he might assure them, that near 1, 100,000l. of it was contracted in the last reign; and as the persons now in the ad-“ministration, were not answerable for that part, Neither did they desire that above one million of it should be this year provided for.

Hereupon the question being put, “ That one million be granted towards paying off the Debt of the Navy, ” it was carried without dividing: Then the Speaker having resumed the chair, it was resolved, according to sir Joseph Jekyll’s motion, to address his majesty “ for an Account of all money granted by parliament for the service of the Navy, from the 1st of January 1710; and how far the said money has been issued for chat purpose, and what the excess of the expence above the provision made by parliament has every year amounted to, ' and what were the causes of such excess.”

Oct. 31. The order of the day being read, for the House to resolve itself into a grand Committee, to consider farther of the supply granted to his majesty, the several Estimates. and Accounts relating to the Land-forces, Chelsea-Hospital and reduced officers, were re-

ferred to the said committee: but a motion being made by Mr. Treby, that the Speaker do now leave the chair, the same was opposed by

Mr. Freeman, who desired that this affair

might be put off, at least till the Friday following, urging, That there had not been sufficient time allowea to the members to peruse the several Accounts and Estimates, and, consequently, they were not prepared to give their opinion thereupon. He was seconded by Mr. Ileysham; but Mr. Yonge answered them both; Mr. Jefferies having replied to Mr. Yonge, he was answered by Mr. Treby, the latter by Mr. Shippen:to whom Mr. R. Walpole having replied, the question was, at last, put upon Mr. Treby’s motion, and carried in the affirmative by 120 against 40. The House having thereupon resolved itself into a grand Committee, Mr. Farrer in the chair, Mr. Treby moved, That a Supply be granted for the same number of forces as were provided for last year, viz. 14, 294 men, including commission and non-commission officers, and 1859 invalids. This was again opposed by Mr. Freeman, who alledged.

Debate in the Lords concerning Mr. Lazof» coming over into England.] October 26. Earl Coningsby represented to their lordships how dangerous it might be, on several accounts, to entertain and countenance such a man as Mr. Law, * and desired that a day might be appointed to take that matter into consideration. Hereupon it was ordered. That the House bo called over that day fortnight.

* “ John Law, esq. {one of the early friends and companions of Captain Steele) was memorable for a fatal duel, in 1694, with Beau Wilson; for which lie was tried at the Old-Bailey; and, being convicted, received a pardon from the. crown; but was detained in prison by the relations of Mr. Wilson under an appeal. He found means, however to escape: and going to France, became the founder of the famous Mississipi scheme. In 1721 (having pacified the surviving relations of Mr. Wilson with 100,000/A he returned ta England, where he continues! to reside till he received the mortifying intelligence of the confiscation of his whole property in France; but being conscious of ths rectitude of his conduct iir the management of the finances, and that the balance .would, upon examination, he found considerably iu his favour, he had good reason to flatter hitur self with the hopes of receiving a large sum, especially as the Regent always professed a more than ordinary regard for him, and continued punctually to remit his official salary of

20,000 livres a year. But the death of his royal

highness, Dec. 2, 1723, was a fetal blow to the hopes of Mr. Law; who, in a memorial to the duke of Bourbon, dated Oct. 15, 1724, states himself as “ bankrupt, not only in France, hot also in other countriesand “ his children courted by the most considerable families in France, as destitute of fortune and establishment.” — “ I had in my power, ” be says “ to have settled my daughter in marriage in the first houses in Italy, Germany and England; but I refused dll offers of that nature, thinking it inconsistent with my duty to, and my affection for, the state in whose service I had the honour to be engaged.” He bad a final adieu to Britain in 1725; and fixed his residence at Venice; where he concluded the chequered course of his life, in'a state but little removed from indigence, March 21, 1729, in his 58th year.” — Steele’s Correspondence, vol. i, p. 520, edit. 1809.

The following account of the Mississipi - seheme is given by Tindal:

u The South-Sea Scheme seems to he taken from that of the Mississipi Company in France, formed by Mr. Law the last year. Mr. Law was born at Edinburgh, and had proposed to the parliament of Scotland, in 1705, a scheme for supplying the nation with money, which though favoured by the duke of Argyle, then high-commissioner, and several members of parliament, was however rejected. Upon this he applied himself to the lord-treasurer Harley, and transmitted to him another proposal for the increase of trade and .credit, but meeting with no encouragement, and not being able to get his pardon, for having killed Beau Wilson in a duel, he was compelled to live abroad, where after undergoing great variety of persecutions from his enemies, he settled in France. During his stay in England, he had informed himself fully of the management of the Bank and East India Company, and, in order to settle the fluctuating mannty of things in France, h£ proposed to the Regent to lay the foundation of credit by erecting a Bank. The Regent approved of the scheme, the Bank was established: the King began the subscription the Regent followed, with innumerable others. This project met with such success, that, in three subscriptions, more than all the money in France was said to be subscribed to it: for, by the end of the year 1719, bills were given out for 640 millions of livres, which exceeds the value of the bills circulated by all the Banks in ' Europe. There was added a circulation of 360 millions, and the whole amounted to 1,000 millions of livres, making above 38 millions of pounds sterling at the Exchange then current.

“ A Bank being thus erected, and credit established, Mr; Law formed the project of the Mississipi or India Company, who were to have the sole privilege of the trade to Louisiana, or the country of Mississipi, so called from a river

his Majesty’s Speech, and proposed the Mon* day following. Hereupon The Earl Coningthy stood op and said, He

of that name, which runs through it from North to South. Pursuant to this scheme, a subscrip* tion of stock was opened, and all were admitted to subscribe. The sum first proposed to be raised was only 60 million of livres, to be sub* scribed in state-bills. These state-bills or pubr lie securities were then very low, being from 5T to 63 per cent, discount; but, as they were received at par without any loss in the company’# stock, the first subscription of 60 millions was soon filled. The capital stock was then cnr larged to 100 millions, and the actions or shares rose to 120, After this a new creation of actions was made for 25 millions more, which were de* livered out at 110, and soon rose to 200. As people appeared very eager to lay out their money this way, an arret of the council of state was published, for circulating bank-bills, to the value of 25 millions, in the Mississipi company, upon which the actions, about Midsummer 1719, run up 560. The company, finding their credit so well established, proposed to lend the king 50 millions, for which there was a new creation of actions for 25 millions, upon the foot of 200 per action. About the end of August, the company proposed to the king another loan of1200 millions, at three per cent. As the actions were now advanced to 1, 200, the company, in order to raise the loan opened their books for 500 millions, by the sale of 50 millions of actions, at the rate of 1,000 per action. The subscriptions were filled in a few hours; and, in less than three weeks, two subscriptions more, for the like sum of 500 millions each, were opened with the same success. The first, payment of these three subscriptions rose so considerably, ns to be sold at. 300 per cent, profit. From that time the actions rose to 2, 050.

“The Mississipi stock was in its greatest prosperity during the months of November, and December 1719; and, in the January filling, Mr. Law, who was become the greatest subject in Enrope, was made comptroller-general of the finances of France. From that time the stock began to decline, and by the end of May, all things fell into, confusion at Paris, occasioned by au arret to reduce bank notes and actions of the company. Mr. Law resigned his place, and had two Swiss officers given him for his guard. By this project the state indeed gained immensely, 1, 500 millions of the king’s debts, being transported front him to the people, who were content to dis* charge the public, and owe the money to one another. Consequently, when the fall came (except a few great fortunes that were made} there was almost a general ruin through all France. This revolution of the Mississipi stock at Paris was not regarded in England, where the like infatuation universally prevailed, and wag followed by the like consequences.”

was not against that motion, but that their meeting, this day, in a full bouse, was in order to consider of the dangerous consequences of Mr. Law’s coming over, at this critical June* ture. That, for his own part, his lordship could not but entertain some jealousy of a person who had done so much mischief in a neighbouring kingdom; and who being so immensely rich, as he was reported to be, might do a great deal more hurt here, by tampering with many who were grown desperate by being involved in the calamity occasioned by the fatal imitation of his pernicious projects. That this person was the more dangerous, in that he renounced not only his natural affection to his country, and his allegiance to his lawful sovereign, by being naturalized in France, and openly countenancing the Pretender’s friends; but, which was worst of all, and weighed most with his lordship, that he also renounced his God, by turning Roman Catholic. Concluding, that they ought to inquire, whether sir John Norris had orders to bring him over ? To this last part of the earl Coningsby’s Speech,

. Lord Carteret answered, in substance, That Mr. Law had many years ago the misfortune to kill a gentleman in a duel, but that having at la$t received the benefit of the king’s clemency, and the appeal lodged by the relations of the deceased, being taken off, he was come over to plead his majesty’s most gracious pardon:that there was no law to keep any Englishman out of his own country j and as Mr. Law was a subject of Great Britain, it was not even in the king’s power to hinder him from eoming over, if he thought fit. To this

The Lord Trevor replied. That Mr. Law was, indeed, a subject of Great Britain, and therefore, as such, had an undoubted right to come hither; but that the circumstances of a person of his character beinj* brought over on board an English admiral, and at this juncture of time, might deserve the consideration of that House.

Earl Cowper spoke much to the same effect: but, however, that matter was set aside, by the lord North and Grey’s moving. That the House be called over that day sev’nnight. This being opposed by some lords, who desired that the ' call might be put off for a fortnight,

Earl Cowper said, It was the constant usage efparliaments/or the House to be summoned, to go upon business, a few days after their meeting:that his majesty had, in his late Speech from the throne, mentioned things of so great importance to the nation, that, for his own part, he took shame to himself, that he had not, before this time, proposed a Call of the House, to take the said Speech into consideration: and that they were very much obliged “to that noble lord for making now that motion.

This was seconded by the duke of Wharton, the lord Trevor, and

Earl Coninpby, which last, in particular, 1

raid. That there were some very remarkable things in that Speech, which he would point out to their lordships, when it came to be consi-

dered; and that he should take the liberty, *«t only to take notice of that speech, but to compare it with two speeches of the last session, and see how they agreed: that, in the meat, time, he could not forbear taking notice of a design of building Barracks, under the notion of Pest-Houses, which his lordship confessed gave him some uneasiness; for it being a thiig we were not used to, it looked like a design t» garrison Standing Forces, to awe the city <f London. Hereupon,

Lord Totcmhend said, That the very reason! which some lords bad made use of, for appointing a short day, weighed rather with him foi putting off the Call of the House for a week longer; , for since there was business of so great importance to be considered, the absent lords ought to have the more time allowed them to settle, their affairs, in order to attend the service of the House; whereas, if one week only was allowed them, many of them could not have dispatched their business so soon.

Then the question being put, whether the Call of the House should be that day sev’nnight, or that day fortnight, it was, upon a division, carried for that day fortnight, by 57 voices against 11. Notwithstanding this disappointment,

The Lord Cowper. returned to the charge, and said, That though the House were not called over so soon as some of their lordships desired, yet they might appoint a shorter day to consider of the King’s Speech. Urging; that it was hardly decent, when a great king, in a peaceable possession, .had made a Speech from his throne, recommending to them matters of the last importance, and pressing dispatch, that in all this time they should have taken no farther notice of it, thau barely to thank him for it, which was a thing of course; and therefore his lordship desired, that they might go upon the consideration of the king’s Speech on the Monday following, which was agreed to without any division.

Debate in the Lords on the Navy-Debt.] November 13. The Lords took his majesty’s Speech into consideration, and

The Lord Nortk and Grey insisted chiefly on the Debt of the Navy, saying, That it was matter of surprize, how such an immense Debt could.be incurred, when the parliament had yearly provided for all that had been demanded for that service."

His lordship was seconded by earl Cowpfer, who went through all the heads of the king’s Speech; and was backed by the lords Trevor and Bathurst, the duke of Wharton, and earl Cooingsby, who all insisted upon an inquiry into the* Debt of the Navy. The lord Carteret, lord Townshend, the earl of Sunderland, and lord Teynham answered, That near two thirds of that Debt had been contracted in the last reign; which they were ready to make appear to the House.

The Bishop of Rochester replied, That since •the Debt was incurred, it was but justice that

The Earl of llay urged, That the public food, and the safety of the nation, being the {rand object and rule of government, some latitude must of necessity be given, and allowances made, to those who are in the administration for extraordinary expences upen unforeseen exigencies. Lord Parker, and some other lords, spoke on the same side.

Then a motion was raade, “ That this House do on Friday next take into consideration the causes of contracting so large a Navy-Debt, end the best methods of preventing the contracting the like Debt for the future/' And the question being stated thereupon, it was proposed to leave out the following words, And the be$t Methods of preventing the contracting the like Debt for the future. '

* Dissentient '

1. u Because the principal end of all parliamentary inquiries into mismanagements, being to prevent the like for the future, we thought it more agreeable to the candour and honour of the House, to express it plainly in the question itself, than leave it to be implied only; and the rather, because it seemed to us/ that the words left ont clearly imported* that nothing personal was in view, but the public good only, which, we thought, would rather have given Satisfaction to the minds of every noble lord, than the contrary.

H. “ When the words now ordered to be left out were, for the reason given, so properly and naturally, as we conceive, made a part of the question, we could not hut apprehend that the laying them aside «n debate might create a suspicion, though unjust, that this House did sot intend to prevent, if possible, the contracting a large and inconvenient Navy-Debt for the future.

S. “ His majesty having, in his Speech from the throne, observed the ill consequences that arise from such a large Debt remaining unprovided for, we thought it very proper, if not necessary, in the resolution taken to enter into Che consideration of that Debt, to express a desire of preventing the like inconvenient Debt being contracted for the future; and that the doing so did not at all prejudge the causes of contracting the present great Navy-Debt; for however necessarily or justifiably an inconvenient thing might have once happened, yet we chink it ought, if it can, to he prevented from happening so again.

4. “ His majesty having likewise observed in his Speech from the throne, that tins part of

the National Debt is, of all others, the most heavy and burthensome; and having set forth the mischiefs arising from the high discount on the Navy and Victualling Bills, we thought ourselves sufficiently warranted to express a desire to consider of the best methods of preventing the like most heavy and burthensome Debt, whatever the causes of contracting the preserit debt shall, on inquiry, appear to be; and this the rather, because the like Navy-Debt can bring no manner of benefit either to the public or any private person, but to such as, by foreseeing when it is either to' he discharged or provided for, may make an excessive advantage to themselves by buying up the said bills while

The Lords took into consideration that part of his majesty's Speech, relating the alliances and treaties with the Northern Potentates. Lord Guildford moved.for an Address to his majesty, That he would be pleased to give orders, that the instructions given to lord Carteret, as minister or plenipotentiary ta Sweden, or any other of the Nortliero crowns, be laid before the House. He was seconded by the earls Cowper and Coningsby, the lord Trevor and the duke of Wharton.

The duke of Wharton opened the debate, and animadverted upon the conduct of those in the administration, both as to the war and peace with Spain:and moved to address the king, That the late Treaty of Commerce, whereby the former Treaties of Commerce are renewed with Spain, may be laid before the House. Tie was seconded by the earl of Strafford, ancj backed by the earls Coningsby and Cowper. The lord Carteret having answered them, the lord North and Grey and lord Bathurst replied to him. The lord viscount Har court spoke in vindication of the ministry, and '‘the earl Coningsby, having answered him, the lord Sunderland said, He did not doubt but his majesty would be always ready to comply with the desires of that House, and even in this particular, as well as others: but that for his part, he would be so free as to declare his judgment against advising his majesty to communicate the treaty in question, at this juncture: because, to his knowledge, there was in it a secret article, which the king of Spain had desired might not be made public, till after the treaty of Cambray was over, and his majesty having granted that request, his lordship therefore hoped, that Ilouse would, not desire his majesty to break his promise.

Further Debate in the Lords on the Navy Debt.] November 22. A person from the* Treasury presented to the House, according to order, an Account of the capital South Sea Stock, as it stood in the year 1711. The reason for the Lords calling for tijis.account was., this. In the debate about the Debt of that Navy, it having been alledged on the court side, that about 1, 100,000l. of it were contracted in the last reign, the other side objected the improbability of it; because the, debt then du*/ to the navy was sunk into, and made part of the original South Sea stock. To this it. being answered by the courtiers, that it did not appear to them .to be so; and that the books of; the Navy and Treasury would set that matter iu a true light, the abstracts of the said books, relating to that matter, were ordered to be laid before the House. It was also objected by the duke of Wharton, That 500,000i. had been issued out of the treasury, in the late queen's* reign, towards paying off the Debt of the Navy: lord Bingley, who was then Chancellor of tb« Exchequer, being desired to tell wlmt he knew* of that affair, acknowledged, that there wa*> such an order, bat. could not remember, whether* the money was, issued out, or not. The same.-day, the Commissioners of the Navy laid before, the House of Lords, accounts of the Debts of the Navy, as they stood in September 1714* and on the 31st of December 1719.

November 27. The Lords went into a Gom*. mittee of the whole House upon the Navy Debt, The Commissioners of the Navy having laid, before their lordships 9ome other papers, relating to that affair, the earl Cowper made* several observations thereupon; and being seconded by the earl Coningsby* was answered by the lord Townshend:The earl Cowper replied, both to him, and to the earl of Sunderland, who. backed the lord Townshend.

November SO. The Lords read the Bill, For 4punishing Mutiny and Desertion, &c/ Then the lord Trevor took notice of the vast number of Half-Pay Officers, who were a great burden to the nation; and that no care was taken, either to lessen that charge, or to reward the past services of the said officers, by advancing them to such posts, as from time to time became vacant in the army; but, that instead of that, new commissions were daily given, and other officers created; concluding with a motion, “ That the House might be informed, how the List of. Half-Pay. Officers stood, and whether their number had been 'diminished since the reduction of the army; in which time it was very probable many of them had died. He was seconded by the lord North and Grey, the earl Coningsby, and the earl Cowper, who were answered by the earl Cadogan, and the lord Townshend; but it was at last ordered, That an Account of the Number of Land Forces and Half-Pay Officers, now in pay, be laid before the House.

Dec. 2. The Commissioners of the Navy laid before their lordships, several Accounts and Papers relating to the Debt of that office, upon which the lord North and Grey, the earl Coningsby, and the earl Cowper, having made several observations, the said Commissioners were examined thereupon, and ordered to lay some other papers before the House.

Dec. ft. The Xords went into a grand Committee upon the Dfebt of the Navy, the earl of Clarendon being in the chair. The Commissioners of the Navy, having laid before the House, some other Papers relating to that affair, the earl Cowper moved that they might be read, which being done accordingly, his lordship made several observations thereupon. He was seconded by the lord Trevor; the earl of Sunderland having answered him, was replied to by the earls Cowper and Coningsby. Lord Sunderland having spoke again, the debate grew warm between the courtiers and the opposite side. Among the first were, the lord Carteret, the lord Townsheod, the duke of Newcastle, the earl of Cadogan, and the lord viscount HarCourt; who were opposed by the earls Cowper and Coningsby, the lords North and Grey, and Bathurst, and the bishop of Rochester. The debate having lasted till five in the evening, a motion was made: “That the employing great numbers of seamen for/several years last past, more than were provided for by parliament, was one great cause of contracting so large a Navy Debt, and of increasing the same, from the sam of 764, 088/.

, Bill for the encouraging the Importation of

Naval Stores.] Nov. 17. This day in the Com- '

inons sir Gilbert Heathcote stood up, and set forth, That since the Russia Company had .engrossed the trade to that country, the. tar was raised above double the price it bore when the *rade was open. That, besides, while wo' fetched our naval stores from Russia, it was in. the power of the Czar, not only to set What price he pleased upon them, but even to pre-, vent our having them at all, in case we should. be at war, either with him, or any of his allies-; or, at least, to hinder onr having them, unless brought over and imported in his own vessels; which, he said, that he was informed the Czar now insisted upon. That therefore, since theso commodities were so absolutely necessary for our navy, it was not fitting we should lie at tho. mercy of a foreign prince for them; especially, since we could be supplied with them from our own plantations, and upon easier terms: for whereas we now pay for the naval stores from. Russia mostly in reqdy money, we might have them from New-England, and other English plantations in America, in exchange for our own manufactures; whereby we should not only encourage his majesty’s subjects abroad, and divert them from setting up and carrying on manufactures which directly interfere with those of Great Britain, but dUo employ our poor at home: concluding, with a motion for bringing, in ft bill, For giving farther Encouragement < for the importation of Naval Stores; ’ which being seconded, tho said bill was ordered to be brought in.

* prevent the Contagion being'brought into this, ‘ Kingdom/ A clause [being offered to be inserted in the Bill, impowering the king to order his officers to fire upon, and sink any •hip coming from an infected place, sir Gilbert Heathcote moved, and was seconded by sir Nathaniel Gould, and Mr. Chiswell, all Turky Merchants, That there might be an exception as to the ships of the Turky Company; alledging, that many of them were abroad, which they expected home venr speedily, and. which could not have notice of this law. They urged besides, that to allow the sinking and destroying all ships coming from infected places, was, in effect, to prohibit all commerce with Turky, where it’ was known by every body, that the plagiie was always in some part or other; whereby we should lose the most beneficial branch of our trade, and which took off so much of our woollen manufacture. To this it was1 answered, by sir Philip Yorke, and Mr. Yonge, That there was a vast difference between the common Plague, which is epidemical in Turky, and the contagion which at present rages in the Southparts of France, to prevent the bringing over of which this bill was chiefly intended. That therefore it might be left to the discretion of the king and his ministers to act ip that matter as they should see occasion, and to give directions accordingly by proclamation:and Mr. Thofaas Broderick added, That for his part, he was more afraid, that in this case, as on other occasions, the king would be too merciful, rather than too severe. Hereupon the Bill was gone through. Then, upon the question, when the Amendment made thereto should be reported, sir Gilbert Heath-cote, and they who were against the Bill, insisted to have it put off, that there might be more time to consider of any objections that might be made against it: but Mr. Broderick said, Ho thought no time ought to be lost in a case of this nature, wherein the lives of us all were concerned:that for his part he wished the Bill could obtain the royal assent that very day; and therefore moved, That it be reported the next day, which being, ordered accordingly, the said amendments were then agreed to and the Bill ordered to be engrossed, and ou the tOth the said Bill was passed.

u Dissentient '

1. “ Because the liberty -of petitioning the king (much more that of petitioning either House of Parliament) is the birthright of the free people of this realm, claimed by them, and confirmed to them, soon after the Revolution, in an Act, declaring' the rights and liberties of the subject, and settling the succession of the crown; and whenever any remarkable check hath been given to the free exercise of this right, it hath always been attended with ill consequences to the public.

2. “ Because the Petition so rejected was, in our opinion, every ways proper and unexceptionable both as to the manner of wording and presenting it, and the matter to which it referred; nothing being more natural and reasonable, than that any corporate body should, if they desire it, be heard upon any bill under the consideration of parliament, whereby they judge their particular interests to be highly, though not solely, affected. This liberty we remember to have been granted in a late session to the traders of Norwich, upon their Petition touching the Callico Bill; . nor are we aware that it hath ever, in like circumstances, been refused to the meanest corporation in the kingdom: ^ut, if it had, we humbly conceive, that in this case a distinction might have been made in favour of the city of London, which being the centre of credit, of the trade and monied interest of the kingdom; and the place where the plague, should we be visited by it, is most likely first to appear; and having also remarkably suffered by means of the late fatal South Sea scheme, was, we think, in a particu- *' lar manner intitled to apply for relief against some clauses in the Quarantine Act, and deserved to have been treated on that occasion with more indulgence and tenderness.

3. “ Because the rejecting the said Petition tends, we conceive, to discountenance all Petitions for the future in cases of a public and general concern, and by that means to deprive the legislature Of proper lights, which they might otherwise receive, it being no ways probable that subjects' or societies of less consideration, will venture to represent their sense;

Ib cases of like bature, after the city of London hare thus been refused to be heard.

4. Because, as the receiving this Petition oould have had no ill consequences, as we conceive, nor have given any great interruption to the business of parliament; so the rejecting it may, we think, widen the unhappy differences that have arisen, and increase the disaffection to the government, which hath already, too' much prevailed in this kingdom.

5. “ Because the arguments used in the debate seem, to its, not to be of sufficient force; for we cannot conceive, that because the said Act of. Quarantine is a general, act, therefore Ho particular, community or city, who think they may, in a distinguishing manner, be prejudiced by it, have a right to be heard in relation to it; and that at a time when it is under consideration of parliament; Nor can we be of opinion, that a Petition agreed on by the lord-mayor, aldermen and citizens of London in common .council assembled, and presented, not even by the numbers allowed by law, but by a lord- of this House, can possibly be a prelude or example towards producing tumultuous petitions; much less can we see, why it "ought the rather to be rejected, because it came from so great a body as the city of London. On the contrary, we apprehend, that an universal grievance, which may be occasioned by any general Act, must be represented to the legislature by particular persoris or bodies corporate, or else it cannot be represented at all; that the meeting such Petition^ and not the receiving them, is, we think, the way to occasion disorders and tumults; and that'the more considerable the body is, the more regard should be had to any application they make, especially for matters' wherein not only the rights, privileges and immunities, hut also their trade, safety and prosperity are, as the Petition avers, highly concerned. — » — ('Signed,)

Debate in the Lords on the Bill relating to iht Blague.] December 11. The Lords went

again into a committee of the whole House, upon the Bill to prevent Infection, and a very warm debate arose. The earl Cowper excepted against the power given by the clause for drawing lines round any city, town, or place infected; and moved, That the cities of Xoadon and Westminster might be excepted. He war seconded by the earl Conihgsby, lord Trevor, lord North and Grey, the earl of Strafford, the bishop of Rochester and lord Bathurst; hut they were answered by the earl of Sunderland, the lord Townshend, the duke •f Wharton and the duke of Newcastle, lord Harcourt suggested, That 200,000 men would Hot be sufficient to guard such great cities as London and Westminster, and therefore he

thought it needless to except them. Then the question being put, upon the earl Cowper* motion, it was carried in the negative by 45 voices against 20.

Farther Debate in the Lords on the Mutiny Bill.]' Dec. 12, The Lords went into a grand committee upon the Bill from the Commons *

‘ For punishing Mutiny and Desertion/ &c« After the reading of it,

The Lord Trevor excepted against the clauses for punishing soldiers with death for desertion; and for exempting them from being arrested for debt. His lordship urged. That the exercise of martial law, in time of peace, was unknown and repugnant to our constitutions, that such a law was indeed necessary during the late rebellion; but there, being at present, no such reason, and all being perfectly quiet, and easy under his majesty’s mild government, the punishment of offences committed by th% soldiery ought to be left to the civil magistrate. And that, on the other hand, it was unreasonable to grant soldiers a protection from theit; 1 lawful creditors, since thereby a great man; poor people, who might be drawn in to trust them, might be ruined.

This speech was answered by the earl Car. dogan, and. the earl of Sunderland; to whom, the lord North and Grey, the earls Coningsby. and Strafford, and lord Bathurst replied. Tha, lord Harcourt having spoken for the bill, he was answered by the earl of Strafford, to whom the. lord Carteret replied; and the question being put. That the number of Standing Forces, be reduced, it was carried, in the negative by 67 voices against 19.

Motion for committing lard Coningtby ttr the Tower, for refecting on the Jus-

tices.] During this debate the. earl Coningtby having severely animadverted upon some of the Lords Justices, appointed by the king wften his majesty went last to Hanover, insinuating. That nobody knew from whence they came.

The Lord Suryierland said thereupon, He did not think any thing that noble lord, who spoke last, had said or could suggest, .to be a reflection on the late regency, of which he had the honour to he one: but as they were chosen and appointed by the king, he thought it a reflection on his majesty, of which the House ought to* take notice, and therefore desired that his words might be taken down in writing. Hereupon

Lord Coningsby said, be did not mean any reflection Upon any that were living, but soma of them that were dead. To this

The Earl of Sunderland replied. That in, his opinion, it was still more indecent and unbecoming the dignity of that august assembly, for any who had the honour to sit in it, to reflect " on persons that were dead and could not an- swer for themselves, than upon persons living, who could speak in. their own justification s and therefore his lordship insisted, That the iearl Coningsby’s wdrds might be wrote down, in order to have bin sent to the Tower. Box

The Lord Hareourt, to moderate the matter, said, He hoped that noble lord meant no reflection, however his words might look that way, and therefore desired he might have liberty to explain himself. Hereupon

The Earl Coningsby declared. He did not

intend to reflect upon any body: that he was sorry what he had said had given offence; begged pardon of the House, and promised to take care not to ofiepd any more in that kind lor the future.

Motion for repealing tome 'Clauses of the Quarantine Act.] Dec. 13. The Lords went into a grand committee, upon the Bill to prevent Infection, which occasioned a warm Debate.

The Earl Cowper moved, That a bill be

brought in, for repealing so much of the act passed the last session, relating to the Plague, ns gives a power to remove to a lazaret or pest-house, any persons whatsoever infected with the plague, or healthy persons out of an infected family, from their habitations, though distant from any other dwelling; and also so much of the said act, as gives power for drawing lines or trenches round any city, town, or place infected; his lordship represented, That the powers above-mentioned were altogether unknown to our excellent constitution, inconsistent with the lenity of our free government; such as could never be wisely or usefully put in practice; and the more odious because they seemed to be copied from the arbitrary government of France, and ceuld not be executed but by military force.

The lord Cowper was seconded by lord Trevor, and backed by the earl Coningsby, the bishop of Rochester, the lord North and Grey, and the earl of Strafford, who replied to the earl of Sunderland, the lords Harcourt, Townshend and Carteret. v .

Protest against rejecting tf.] But the question being put thereupon, it was resolved in the negative; by 39 against 30.

* Dissentient*,

“ 1. Because the powers specified in the question seem- to us such hs can never wisely or usefully be pot in execution; for by the first of them, persons of what rank or condition soever, either actually iufected, or being in the same habitation, though in lone houses where they are well accommodated, and from whence there is no danger of propagating the infection, may be forcibly removed into common lazarets or pest-houses; and it does not appear to us, that such a power could, at any time, be reasonably executed; and therefore, we conceive k should be repealed. — The other power extends to the drawing of lines around any city, town or place, and consequently around the cities of London and Westminster; the very apprehension of which, upon the least rumour of a plague, would disperse the pich, and by that means (as well as by hindering the free access of provisions) starve the poor, ruin, trade,

I and destroy all the remains of public and private credit.

“ 3. Because such powers as these are utterly unknown to our constitution, and repugnant, we conceive, to the lenity of our mild and free government; a tender regard to which was shewn by the act James I. winch took care only to confine infected persons within their own houses, and to support them under their confinement, and lodged the execution of such powers solely in foe civil magistrate; whereas the powers by us excepted against, as they are of a more extraordinary kind, so they will probably (and some of them must necessarily) be executed by military force; and the violent and inhuman merhods which, on these occasions, may, as we conceive, be practised, will, we fear, rather draw down foe infliction of a new judgment from Heaven, than contribute any way to remove that which shall then hard befallen us.

" 3. Because, we take it, these, methods were copied from France $ a kingdom, whose pattern, in such cases, Great Britain should not follow, the government there being conducted by arbitrary power, and supported by standing armies }• and to such a country such method* do, in our opinion, seem most suitable: and yet; even in that kingdom, the powers thus exercised of late have been as unsuccessful as they were unprecedented; so that no neighbouring state hath any Encouragement from thence to follow so fatal an example. In the first plague with which we were visited, a. d. 1665, though none of these methods were made use of, much less authorised by parliament, yet foe infection, however great, was kept from spreading itself into foe remoter parts of thn kingdom; nor did foe city of London, where it first appealed and chiefly raged, suffer so long ' or so much, in proportion to the number 6f it? inhabitants, as other cities and towns in France have suffered, where these cruel experiments have been tried.

“ 4. Because had such part of foe act as we think should be repealed, been accordingly repealed, there would still have remained m it e general- clause, which gives foe crown all powers necessary to prevent foe spreading of infection, and consequently these very powers, among the rest, if they shall be found necessary; and therefore there is no need, we conceive, to have them expressly grantee) in foe same act of parliament, which seems not only to s£srrant, but in a particular manner to prescribe and direct the use of them.

“ 5. Because the great argument urged for continuing these powers specified io the question, that they Would probably never be put in execution ib the cases objected to, seems to us a clear reason why they should not be continued; for we cannot imagine why they should stand enacted, unless they are Intended to be executed, or of what use it will be to foe public to keep the minds of foe people perpetually alarmed with those apprehensions, under which they now labour, as appear* by the petition

from the city of London lately rejected: it may be an instance of our great confidence in his majesty’s wisdom and goodness, when we trust him with such powers, unknown to the constitution; but, we think, it ill becomes us to repose such trust, when it tends, in our opinion, rather to render him terrible than amiable to his subjects, and when the only advantage he can, as we conceive, draw from the trust reposed in hiny is, not to make use of it. - — (Signed,) W.

Motion for Sir George Byng’s Instructions toncerning the Action against the Spanish Fleet.] December 19, The House went again upon the king’s Speech at jbe opening of the session, and took into.consideration that-part of it relating to the treaty with Spain. The earl of Strafford suggested, That a? the war with Spain was undertaken without necessity, or a just provocation, so the peace was concluded without any benefit or advantage: that contrary to the law of nations, the Spanish fleet was fallen upon without any declaration of war, and even while a British minister and secretary of state was amicably treating at Madrid; So that the Spaniards might think themselves secure from any hostilities: and as the manner Of beginning the war with Spain did not appear justifiable, neither could the war itself be easily reconciled with sound politics, since it was an interruption to one of the most valuable brauches of our trade; and at a time when the nation groaned under the pressure of heavy debts, occasioned by a former long expensive war. Concluding with a motion for an Address to his majesty, that he would be pleased to cause the Instructions that were given to sir George Byng, in relation to the Action against the Spanish fleet in the Mediterranean, to be laid before the House.

. He was seconded by lord North and Grey, the archbishop of York, the earls of Aylesford and Cowper, the lords Guildford, Trevor, and Bathurst. They were answered by the earl of Sunderland, the duke of \yharton, and lord Carteret.

Protest against rejecting if.] And the question being put upon the said motion, it passed in the negative by 67 voices against 24.

« Dissentient ’

“ 1. Because not finding any instance, on •earch of the Journals, we believe there is none, wherein a motion for Admirals’ Instructions to be laid before the House has been denied-; but, on the contrary, there are many

Sirecedents of instructions of a like nature, and n stronger cases, as we conceive, addressed for by the House, and several in point, for instructions given to admirals, particularly to' sir George Hooke and sir Cloudesly Shovel;

.^Protest against the Mutiny Bill. [990

nor does it seem, to us, at all material, whether the conduct of such admirals had or had not been blamed before such instructions were asked for, since the sight of instructions may be previously and absolutely necessary to inform the House, whether their conduct ba blaraeable or not.

u 2. Because we think it highly reasonable, that those instructions should be laid before this House, upon which the action of the British against the Spanish fleet in the Mediterranean was founded, without any previous declaration of war, and even whilst a British minister, a secretary of state, was amicably treating at Madrid, which court might justly conclude itself secure from any hostile attack during the continuance of such negotiations.

M 3. Because, till we have a sight of those, instructions, and are able to judge of the reasons on which they are founded, the war with Spain, in which that action of our fleet involved us, does not appear to us so justifiable as we fcould wish, and yet wai plainly prejudicial to the nation in, sundry respects; for it occasioned an entire interruption of our most valuable commerce with Spam, at a time when Great Britain needed all the advantages of peace to extricate itself from that heavy national debt it lay under; and as it deprived us of the friendship of Spain (not easily to be retrieved) so it gave our rivals in trade an opportunity to insinuate'themselves into, their affections; and we conceive that to that war alone is owing the strict unidn there is at present between the crowns of France and Spain, which it was the interest of Great Britain to have kept always divided; an union which in its consequences may prove fatal to these kingdoms. — Nor does it appear that Great Britain has had any fruits from this war, be-yona its being restored to the same trade we’ had yrith Spain before we began it. — — /'Signed, }, W.

Protest against passing the Mutiny .1 Dec. 21.

" 1.Because we have beard no arguments to convince us, that there is any necessity for a greater number of troops being kept on foot at this time, than there was after the peace of Ryswick or the peace of Utrecht; for as to the argument urged from the present disaffeo- tion of the people, we are fully persuaded; * that the keeping up so great an> army is much more likely to increase than lessen such disaf* fection,

9G7J PAUL. HISTORY, 8 George I; 1722. — Hitt. - [#3£

, <(2. Because this precedent (is likely to be followed ia all subsequent times, there being no probability that a conjuncture can happen, when there will be less apparent reason for keeping up a great number of forces, than at this time of a general tranquillity.

“ 3. Because, we conceive, there are seve* ral clauses in this biU, which tend to overthrow the civil power in .this kingdom, and turn it into a military government; and we apprehend it to be our duty to take care, that so dangerous a precedent may not be made for any future time without an evident necessity; and it is plain there is no such necessity for erecting this military power within this kingdom in time of peace, because the army was well governed without it in the two former reigns.

“ 4. That allowing such a number of troops were necessary, yet there is no reason can be alledged, as we apprehend, that they should be constituted in this expensive manner, which Raises the charge upon the nation to about double what it was, in time of peace, in the two former reigns: and we must, with great concern, assert, that the public is much less able to bear such an excess at the present, than

The Quakers’ Affirmation Bill brought into the Commons.'] Dec. 14. A Petition of the people called Quakers, on behalf of such of their friends who scruple the form of solemn Affirmation, was presented to the House, and read; setting forth, “ That many of .their friends do conscientiously scruple the present form , of solemn Affirmation; whereby they .have fallen under great sufferings, by imprisonment, or loss of their properties; they not being able to answer in courts of equity, take probates of wills, prove debts on commissions of bankruptcy, verify their entries on the leather or candle acts, take up their freedoms, be admitted to poll for their freeholds, give evidence. for others, nor to declare their fidelity to the present government: all which they conceive to be hardships; and praying. That leave may be given to bring in a Bill for granting them such a Form of Affirmation as may remove the difficulties they now lie under."

This Petition was spoke to by sir John Ward, and Mr. Heysham, members for London, who were backed by the lord William Paulet, Mr. Sloper, Mr. Horatio Walpole, and sir Wilfrid Lawson; whereupon a Bill was ordered to be brought in, according to the prayer of the said 'Petition; which Bill passed the House, on the 9th of the following month.

Debate in the Lords on the’Affirmation Bill.] January 9, 1722. The Lords

being met-again, their lordships read the first time the Quakers' Bill; but a motion being made, That the said bill be read a second time,

the same was opposed by the lord North and Grey. He was seconded by the

Bishop of Rochester, who, among other things, said, He did not know why such a distinguish- > ing indulgence as was intended by this bill should be allowed to a set of people, who were hardly Christians. To this

The Earl of I lay answered, He wondered that reverend prelate should call in question, whether the Quakers were Christians; since they wereso, at least by act of parliament, being included in the Toleration Act, under the general denomination of Protestant Dissenters.

The Bishop of Rochester smartly replied, it was against the standing Orders of that august’assembly to make any personal reflections; and he thought it a much greater indecency to'makw a jest of any thing that was sacred and that the calling the Quakers, Christians by act of parliament, was a sort of side-wind reflection upon Christianity itself. However, he would let that pass, and reserve to another opportunity what he had to offer against the bill.

On the other hand, the earl of Sunderland, and the lords Carteret and Bathurst having spoke for a second reading, the same was ordered for the 15th.

Debate in the Lor dir elating to the Building *

of Ships for foreigners.'] January 11. The Lords resumed the debate about the Building' » of Ships for Foreigners, which was opened by the earl of Coningsby, and seconded by the lord North and Grey and the earl Cowper. Their lordships suggested, “ That the practice of building ships for foreigners may be attended with very ill and dangerous consequences; for as such foreigners, though at present in amity with us, may yet, one time or other, become our enemies, they will in such a case make use of those very ships to fight against qurselves. And that besides this general consideration, the present great scarcity of timber in England, made such a practice so muoh the more unjustifiable, especially if it was considered what great number of ships had lately been built for the French, some of which were sixty or seventy gun ships."

To this the lords Carteret and Townshend answered in general, “ That they knew of no law in being to hinder any ship carpenter from working for any one that would employ him; that thq French, though now in amity, may, indeed, be one day our enemies: but yet, if they built not here such ships as they have occasion for, they might get them built in Holland, or Hamburgh; and their lordships were of opinion, it was better for us Ho get their money than our neighbours: that indeed if we could hihder the French from building ships at all, it would be prudent to do it, but since they can hare them in other places, our prohibiting them to buy them here, would rather be detrimental than advantageous to us." -

The Judges, whose opinions the House desired! to have, not being all come, the further consideration of that affair was put off till the next day.

m] PARL. HISTORY, 8 GsoMt 1 on Navy Debt. [040

The Judges* Opinion thereon.'] January 12. The Judges that were in town being present,

The Earl Cotnper set forth the pernicious practice which, for some time, had been curried oh, of building ships of force for the French, not only in the river Thames, . but also at Bristol, and was seconded by the lord North and Grey. They were answered by .

The Lord Tonnehead, who alkdged, That

there was no law against it that he ktoew of.

The Earl Comper thereupon moved. That the

Judges might be asked their Opinions as to that point; and being seconded by the lord Coningsby, the question was put to them accordingly.

Thereupon the Lord Chief Justice Prat, in die name of all the Judges present, except baron Montague, who desired farther time to consider of it before he gave his opinion, declared, “ That they knew of no law, whereby the king was impowered to hinder any of his subjects from building ships for any one that would employ them, whether natives -or foreigners.” Hereupon

The Earl Camper said. That if there was no such law, it was high time there should be one, to pat a stop to such a pernicious practice lor the future; and therefore moved “ That the Judges be ordered to bring in a Bill for that purposed

This motion being opposed by the earl of Sunderland, the earl Cowper replied to him, which occasioned a debate between the lord Towhshend, the earl of Sunderland, the duke' of Argyte, and the lord Carteret on the one Side j and the lord Bathurst, the earl Coningsby, and the lord North and Grey on the other side t but at last the court-party dropt their opposition to the earl Cowper’s motion, provided this clause “except licensed by his majesty” be added to the said Bill, which was ordered to be brought in:but it did not pass into a law.

Farther Debate in the Lordst on the Navy. Debt.] January 13. The Lords in a grand committee resumed the consideration of the great Debt of the Navy.

Earl Cowper moved, That the Papers laid before the House, by the commissioners of the Navy, relating to the number of ships employed in the Baltic and Mediterranean, might be read; which being done accordingly, his lordship observed, Tjiat one great cause of the Navy Debt, was, the not discharging the Seamen belonging to his majesty’s ships when they came home, but keeping them in sea-pay all whiter. To this

* Lord Torrington .answered. That though seaman in the winter might be said to be of no use, yet the keeping them in pay was an expence absolutely necessary; tor if they were discharged, the government would, he to seek for them in the spring, when they had occasion for them, since seamen cannot live without business; and if not employed in the royal navy, they are forced to hire themselves either to the merchants or into foreign service *

The House being resumed, a motion .was

made, “ That the not .paying off his majesty’s ships when they came home from their several voyages, according to the ancient usage of the Navy, but continuing them in sea-pay daring the winter, till they went out again, has been one great cause of contracting so large a Navy-Debt, ”

Protest on that occasion.] And a question being stated thereupon, after debate, the previous question was put, Whether the said question shall be now put ? It was resolved the negative.

“ Dissentient?

' 1. “ Because, we conceive the main ques- -don ought to have been put, since the practice complained of in it having been from the year 1690 very frequently represented against to the Admiralty and the Treasury, by the commissioners of the Navy (the proper officers to give advice in suchmatters, and who then were men of great experience, ability and probity) for being contrary to the ancient uaageof the Navy* giving great disgust to the seamen, and causing an unnecessary expence of (he public money i we thought it highly reasonable to endeavour that a stop should be put to this method, which was attended with so many fatal consequences; and we cannot but think, the putting and voting the main question in the affirmative would have gready conduced to that end.

2. “ Because it did not appear necessary, at a time when so few men were either granted or demanded for the service of any 6ne year, that the seamen should be treated with so much severity, as not to be paid off according to the ancient usage of the navy, but kept in floating prisons, as the said commissioners of the navy very well express it; especially since we find, that during the late wars, when 40,000 men year were granted, this was truly thought, by the said commissioners of the navy, a way rather to provoke the seamen to desert, than encourage them to come into or continue in the service; and to be the principal, if not the only reason, why it is become so difficult to get them again when wanted.

8. “We thought at this juncture, when his majesty bad so lately, in a most gracious speech from die throne, signified his having so happily established peace throughout Europe, it would be proper (if ever) to use our best endeavours that the seamen might partake of the benefit of our mild and free government, and’ not be liable to greater hardships than any of their fellow subjects, as we think they would be, if this practice be suffered to continue *

4 “ Because such methods ought to be used as will most contribute to procure the affections of the seamen to the service, which, we think, the ancient usage of the navy will in this case ' best effect; by which they will have the satisfaction to spend their money within the kingdom, for the benefit and support of their families, as formerly, when the ships were paid off at their return -home from their several voyages; and will, we hope, prevent their ah-

standing' from, and deserting the service, end engage them eheerfolly to enter into k whenever there shall be occasion; whereas according to the late practice, by the opinion of the shut commissioners of the navy, the difficulty of 'getting them in the spring chiefly rises from beeping them all winter, and yet the difficulty of getting them again is assigned as the only reason for keeping them in pay during the winter, although it amounts to an intolerable charge upon the kingdom; it appearing by one of the papers now upon the table, that keeping them in pay all the winter comes to near five times as much as raising them again in the spring/

" S. “ We cannot but think It a very unusual tray of arguing in a house of parliament, that m question ought not to be put, because it is generally admitted to be true; though at the same time there may be too mncb reason to believe that the practice complained of will not be altered without the interposition of parliament.

6. “ We cannot conceive the treaty with Sweden could make it necessary, as was alledged, to keep the men in pay all the winter; since it appears by the papers upon the table, that very little or no time would nave been lost, if the old method of the navy of raising them in the spring had been followed, by which much money would have been saved to the public; especially since their so early arrival there did neither prevent landing the Czar’s troops in Sweden, when and where they pleased, nor by any action at sea contribute to weakeahis naval

m lastly. We take it to be very clear, that if a&y necessity or sufficient reason was foreseen at any time for the dispensing with this rale of the navy, it ought not to have been done without his majesty’s consent in council; it being, as we conceive, a fundamental maxim in the government of the navy, add a most essential part of' his majesty's prerogative, that no role of establishment in the navy, whether written or unwritten, and customary, ought to be, or can regularly be abrogated, altered, or dispensed with, but by his majesty’s consent in council, especially in so .weighty a point as spending the public treasure so much foster than it deed have been in the. proportion above-mentioned; and therefore we thought it expedient that the main question should have been put and voted in the affirmative, that this great and useful prerogative of the crown might by’1 censuring what we take to be a breach thereof (though with the temper recommended from the throne) have been the better preserved tor

further Debate in the Lords on the Affirmation Bi//.] January 15. The Lords read the Quakers’ Bill the second time, and a motion being made and the question put, That

the said bill be committed, the same was op* posed by the

Bishop of Rochester, who according to his former assertion, endeavoured to prove, that the Quakers were no Christians.

Ha lordship was seconded by the earl of Strafford, lord North and Grey, earl Coningsby, ' and his grace the archbishop of York; but they were answered-by the earl of Sunderland, the duke of Argyte, the bishop of Peterborough, the earl of Ilay, mid the earl of Macclesfield; and the question being put for committing the bill, was carried* in the affirmative by 64 voices. against 14.

Petition of the London Clergy against the said* Bill] Jan. 17. Their lordships were to go. into a grand committee upon the said Bill, but were prevented by an unexpected Petition from some of the London Clergy, which wait presented by the arqhbishop of York, and was as follows:

“ That there is a Bill now depending in your lordships’ House, intituled An Act for granting < the people called Quakers Such a form or (Affirmation or Declaration as may remove ‘ thp difficulties which many of them lie ‘ under.’ Which Bill, shouni it pass into a low, as it may, in its consequences, nearly affect the property of the subject in genera], so it will in a more especial manner endanger the legal maintenance of the clergy by tythes; in aa much as the people called Quakers pretend to deny the payment of tythes upon a principle of conscience, and therefore as your Petitioners apprehend, may be under strong inducements to ease their consciences in that respect by violating them in another, when their shnpla affirmation on behalf of friends/of the same persuasion, shall pass in all courts of jodicaturi for legal evidence.

“ However, the injuries that your Petitioners in their private affairs may possibly suffer; are, as they ought to be, of small account with them m comparison of the mischiefs which may redound to the society from the indulgence intended, as it seems to imply, that justice may be duly administered, and government supported without the intervention of any solemn appeal to God as a-witness of the truth of what is said, by all persons, in all cases, of great importance, Ho the common welfare; whereas your Petitioners are firmly persuaded, that an oath was instituted by God himself as the surest bond of fidelity among men, and bath been esteemed, and found to be so by the wisdom and experience of all nations in all ages.

“ But that which chiefly moves your Petitioners to apply to. your lordships, is, their serious concern lest the minds of good men should be grieved and wounded, and the enemies of Christianity triumph, when they shall see such condescensions made by a Christian legislature

to a set of men who renounce the divine institutions of Christ, particularly that by which the faithful are initiated into his religion, and denominated Christians, and who cannot on this account, according to the uniform judgment, and practice of the Catholic church, be deemed worthy of that sacred name.

“ Your Petitioners moreover crave leave to represent to your lordships, that upon the best information they can get, the instances wherein any Quaker hath refused the solemn affirmation prescribed by an act in the seventh and eighth year of William the 3rd, have from the passing that act to this day been exceeding rare, so that there might be ground to hope, that the continued use of the said solemn affirmation, would by degrees have intirely cured that people of all those unseasonable prejudices against an oath which the favour designed them by this bill may tend to stoengthen and confirm.

u And your Petitioners humbly leave it to your lordships* wise deliberations, whether such an extraordinary indulgence granted to a people already, as is conceived, tpo numerous, may not contribute to multiply their sept, ana tempt persons to profess thdmselves Quakers, in order to be exempted from the obligation of oaths, and to stand upon a foot of privilege not allowed to the best Christians in the kingdom..

* < Your Petitioners therefore humbly nope, that these and other considerations, which may. offer themselves to your lordships* great wisdom, may induce your lordships not to give your consent to the passing of this bill into a law. And your petitioners shall ever pray, &c.”

The Archbishop of Yo spoke in behalf of this Petition, ana moved, That it be received and read:

The lord North and Grey, the earl of Strafford, the bishop of Rochester, the earl Coningsby, lord Trevor, earl Cowper, and lord Bathurst, supported the archbishop of York’s motion; but the same was warmly opposed by the lord Townshend, earl of Scarborough, earl of Sunderland, lord Carteret, duke of Argyle, earl of Ilay, and the bishop of Peterborough; and the question being at last put thereupon, it was carried in the negative.

AU the bishops present, except the two archbishops, the bishops of Oxford, Litchfield and Coventry, and Rochester, being against the Petition. In this debate, the bishop of Sarttm proposed, that the Petitioneh might have leave to withdraw their Petition; but this was opposed by

Lord Sunderland, who said, That a committee ought to be appointed to inauire into the authors aod promoters ef it; for he looked upon it to be no better than a libel.

Lord Townshend took notice of the irregular way in which the said Petition was presented, far if it was a petition of the London clergy it ought to be offered either by the bishop of that diocese, or the archbishop of Canterbury, whereas it was presented by the archbishop of York, who was metropolitan of another pro- . via*,

Then the question being put, That the1 said Petition be rejected, it was resolved in the affirmative, by 60 voices against 24.

Protest against rejecting the said .]

Whereupon the following Protest was entered s “ Dissentient *

“ 1. Because the right of petitioning in a legal manner to legal purposes does, we apprehend, appertain by law and usage to the free people of this realm, and is as essential to the subject, acting within his due bounds, as the liberty of debate is to the constitution of parliament:and this right, as it extends to the petitioning even for the repeal of acts now in force, by which the people think themselves aggrieved, so it justifies them yet more in representing their humble sense of any new law, while it is under the consideration of parliament; nor are the clergy, we presume, less privileged in relation to the exercise of this right, than any other of his majesty's subjects: On the contrary, we believe them as worthy of enjoying it, and ns capable of exerting it _te wise and good ends, as any rank of private meh in the kingdom.

“ 2. Because the petition so rejected is, in

oar opinion, proper and inoffensive, both as to the matter and the manner of it; since it partly relates to the peculiar rights of the clergy in point of tythes, and partly expresses theit fears, as we conceive not altogether groundless, lest the sect of Quakers, already too numerous, should by this new indulgence be greatly multiplied, and lest the honour of religion should any ways suffer, and the foundations of government be shaken by what is intended; both which it is the particular duty of their func^ tion to uphold and secure. We are not therefore apprehensive, that it misbecame their characters to interpose on any of these important points: And the way in which they have done it, roost seem to us free from exception, till some passages in their petition is pitched upon, as obnoxious, and censured by the Houses which, as yet, hath not been done.

3. “ Because the petition suggests a particular grievance, under which the clergy will suffer by this act, more than any other order of men; which as it had never been observed on the debates on die bill, so was allowed to deservo the consideration of the House. And therefore, had there been any other part of their petition less unexceptionable (as we apprehend, there is not') yet we do^ not think that it was unreasonable to lay aside the whole on that account, and reject what was acknowledged fit to be considered, for the sake of what wa» thought improper to be offered.

4. “ Because the clergy of London are not, in general, so liberally provided for, but that they have reason to be watchful in relation to any step that may unwarily be taken, towards diminishing their maintenance; which we look upon as not duly proportioned to their labour *, iu populous parishes, and to the various employment! given them by infidels and heretics.

papists, and divers sects of men dissenting from the church established by law, with which this metropolis is known to abound. And as their situation gives them near opportunities of observing and knowing what may be stirred in parliament, to the prejudice of'their order; so we cannot but think, that it becomes them to make use of that advantage, in behalf of their distant brethren, as often as need shall require; especially at a time when the representatives of the clergy are not attending in convocation, and in a readiuess to exert their known right of applying to the legislature on all such occasions.

“ 5. Because the London Clergy, from whence the petition came, are, in our opinion, and have been always esteemed, of great consideration, with respect to their extensive influence, and their ability to be serviceable to the state in important conjunctures. From this body of men have proceeded many of the most eminent lights of the church, and ornaments of the bishops* bench, especially since the Revolution; and, in the reign preceding it, their never to be forgotten labours put a stop to the torrent of popery, then ready to overflow us. On which, and.many other accounts, we cannot but wish, that the applications at any time made to this House by the City Clergy, might be received with regard and tenderness, and a ipore than ordinary indulgence allowed them, at a time when so great favours are about to be bestowed on the professed oppugners of their function and maintenance.

u 6. Because by experience, we find, that the treating in this manner a petition from any great and considerable body of men is not the best way to allay the jealousies, and extinguish the uneasiness that occasioned it: a very contrary effect having followed (according to the best of our observation) from the rejecting a petition lately offered by the city of London; And the oftener such instances are repeated, the more, we fear, the disaffection of the people will encrease, who, thinking themselves under hardships, from which they desire to be relieved, may look upon it, as a new and yet greater hardship not to be heard; and though we mpdest and dutiful demeanor of the clergy should no ways contribute to these consequences, yet we know not how far this may be the case with respect to their flocks, to whom their persons and characters are dear, and who may therefore be induced, by the reverence they bear to their pastors, to express as much concern on their account, as they would do on their own: for which reason it was our earnest desire, that this second, and, in our opinion, . dangerous experiment might not have been made *.• — — (Signed,) W.

The Quakers* Affirmation Bill passes the

Lords. J June 18. The Lords went into a Committee on the Quakers* hill: and after the reading of the first clause, the Archbishop of Canterbury moved, “ That the Quakers’ Affirmation might not be admitted in Courts of judicature, but among themselves;" and the Archbishop of York moved for a clause, “That the Quakers* Affirmation should not go in any suit at law for tythes ; * but the question being put thereupon, it was carried in the negative by 52 voices against 21.

Protest against *7.] > Jan. 19. The Bill was read the third time, and the question being put, “ That the Bill do pass/* it was resolved in the affirmative.

u Dissentient* W. Cant. Jo. Oxon.

“ 1. Because the privileges allowed by this Bill to the Quakers are without example, and no ways proportioned to the, steps formerly taken towards a gradual indulgence of them; for whereas they have been hitherto under the real obligation of an oath, though dispensed with as to some formalities, with respect to the manner of wording and taking it, they are now altogether released both from the form and substance of an oath, and admitted to profess fidelity and give testimony upon their simple affirmation; nor are these great privileges indulged to them, as the less were, from time to time, and by degrees, but are at once made perpetual.

“ 2. Because. we look upon the Quakers, who reject the two sacraments of Christ, aod are, as far as they so do, unworthy of the name of Christians, to be on that account unworthy also of receiving’such distinguishing-marks of favour.

“ 3. Because the Quakers, as they renounce the institutions of Christ, so have not given even the evidence by law required of their belief of his divinity, it no ways appearing to us, nor do we believe it can be made appear, that ever since they were first indulged, 1 W. & M-one Quaker in an hundred hath subscribed the profession of Christian belief directed by that act; nor could we, upon a motion made in the House, prevail, that they should even now be obliged, by such previous subscription, to -in-title themselves to the new and extraordinary favours designed them; the consequence of which must, in our opinion, be, that they will encourage themselves yet farther in their aversion to subscribe that profession of Christian belief, which they seem more to decline than even the taking of an oath, since great numbers of them have sworn, though very few Lava subscribed that profession; nor are we without apprehensions, that it may reflect some dishonour on the Christiaa faith, if the evidence, given by such persons, on their bare word, shall, > by law, be judged of equal credit with the solemn oath of an acknowledged Christian and sincere member of the established communion.

947] PAUL. HISTORY, George

u 4. Because we look upon it as highly unreasonable, that in a kingdom where the nobles, the clergy and commons are obliged to swear fealty to the crown, and even the sovereign himself takes an oath at his coronation, a particular sect of men, who refuse to serve the state either as civil officers or soldiers, should be entirely released from that obligation; since it is natural to expect, that persons thus indulged, as to the mauner and the measure of performing their allegiance, should, by degrees, be induced totally to withdraw it, until they become as bad subjects as Christians.

“5. Because, though such extraordinary privileges are allowed to the sect of Quakers by this bill, yet there is no mark or test prescribed by it, or by any other act, by which it may certainly be known who are Quakers, and consequently who a, re or are not intitled to those privileges; from whence this inconvenience may arise, that many not really Quakers may yet shelter themselves under the cover of that name, on purpose to be released from the •bligation of oaths; it not being, we conceive, in the power of the magistrate, as this bill stands, to oblige any person to take an' oath, who at the time of tendering it shall profess himself a Quaker; so that the concessions now made to that sect may prove a great inlet to hypocrisy and falshood, and will naturally tend towards increasing their numbers, which we rather wish may be every day diminished.

> u 6. Because we do not apprehend, that the Quakers, as a sect, are really under such genr-pies in point of an oath, that it is necessary to ease them by such an act, few of them having for five and twenty years past, since their so-km affirmation, equivalent to an oath, was enacted, ever refused to comply with it; and should this have now and then happened, yet when the great body of any sort sectaries are at ease in their consciences, the scruples of a few, we think, ought not to be regarded, especially if continuing the law now in force will probably extinguish those scruples; and the repeal of it wilt certainly give new life and strength to them.

“ 7. Because the security of the subject's property, which depends upon testimony, seems to us to be lessened by this act; ' the reverence (of an oath having been always observed to operate farther towards the discovery of truth, than any other less solemn form of asseveration; nor can the Quakers be excepted in this case, whose awful apprehensions of an oath appear from their earnest endeavours to decline it; ond therefore, where the payment of tithes, by them held to be sinful, is concerned, they will have strong inducements to disguise the truth, in what they simply affirm, rather than wound their consciences and credit, by contributing towards the support of such antichristian pay* meat: in other cases of property, tfieir interest only will clash with their veracity; but the. double motive of interest and conscience will influence them with respect to the clergy, whose calling and maintenance they eoually condemn.

L 1722. — ~'BHlfor better Securing [945

u 8. Because the inducement mentioned in the bill towards granting the Quakers those fa-vours, that they ate well affected to the government, a position of which we have some doubt, might, we apprehend, he improved into a reason for granting the like favours to Deists, Arians, Jews, and even to Heathens themselves; all of which may possibly b, as some of them certainly are, friends to the government: however, their friendship, we presume, would be cultivated at too great an expence, if, for the sake, of it, any thing should be done by the legislature which might weaken the security of all governments, an oath; and by that means do more mischief to the state in one respect, than it brought advantage in another: and we the rather thus choose to- reason, because an argument was urged in the debate, and no ways disallowed, That if Heathens themselves were equally of use to the state, as the Quakers are, they ought also, equally by few, to be indulged; whereas our firm persuasion is, that as no man should be persecuted for his opinions in religion, so neither should any man, who is known to avow principles destructive of Christianity, however useful he may otherwise be to the state, be encouraged by a law, made purposely in his favour, to continue in those principles. —

ilfr. Hutcheson's Speech on the Bill for better securing the Freedom of .] January

23. The Bill For better securing the Freedom of Elections of Members to serve in Parliament'was read a second.time. Upon which

Mr. Archibald Hutcheson stood up and spoke for the committing the same, as follows:

“ Mr. Speaker;

u Though I think the necessity of the Bill which has been read to you, is of itself a sufficient argument for it, yet since I was one of those who had the honour of your commands for bringing it in, it may, perhaps, be expected that I should say something upon it. As therefore there is too much reason to apprehend, that this is the last struggle you are ever like to have for the preservation of your rights and liberties; so certainly the efforts of every honest man are more than ordinarily requisite at this critical juncture, to procure, if it be possible, the choice of a free and independant parliament, that being the only means, under Providence, which can save you from that state of ruin and confusion which seem so immediately to threaten, and' to be hanging over you. If you should have the misfortune to miscarry, and that the majority of this House should hereafter be composed of persons, who have views and schemes to pursue repugnant to the, common good and ease of their country, what else must, you then expect but the continuance at least, if not the increase, of those heavy burthens you have already upon you, and at every turn to see the honour and sanction of parlia-

949] PAUL. HISTORY, 6 George '

merit basely prostituted to the destructivemea-t sures of those, who shall then happen to be in power, which, without other means of violence could not be justified and supported? If you should be plunged into an unnecessary and expensive war, if your trade and interest should be sacrificed for the service of other princes, and it may be, that done too, only to eitgage them to the concession of foreign} provinces and acquisitions, in which Britain has not the least concern, what redress could our country hope for, even under such grievances, from patriots who had themselves contributed towards them, or were the mercenary tools and dependents of those who had? All manner of licentiousness and public frauds would then have their open and avowed advocates; and it would be no wonder to 9ee the greatest criminals escape unpunished, when the power of remission and pardon of crimes were so much in their own hands.

<“ It is too notorious what attempts are now carrying on to invade the freedom of your approaching elections; in some places by threats, to till and overawe them with the quartering of troops, if they do not comply; in others, by the corrupt solicitations of agents and undertakers, employed by those who, from the incredible sums which are dispersed, one must imagine, have more than private purses at their command.

“ But what, in God’s name* can all this tend to? What other construction can any man in common sense put upon all these things, but that there sefems to have been a formed design, by violence and oppression, first to bumble yo'u and to make yeur necks pliable to the yoke that is designed for you, and then to finish the work by tempting the poverty and necessities of the people, to sell themselves into the most abject and detestable slavery; for that very money which bad boen either unnecessarily raised, or mercilessly and unjustly plundered and torn from Clteir very bowels ? And thus you •may be in arfair way oi 'being subdued by your own weapons. Nor can I imagine what in-, ducement men can have, who run from borough to borough, and purchase their elections at such extravagant rates, unless it be from a strong expectation of being well repaid for their votes, and of receiving ample recompence and rewards for the secret service they have covenanted to perform here. In this situation, it is high time for gentlemen to put themselves upon their guard; and if it be not already too' late, to endeavour to put a stop to the course of those evils, which are otherwise likely so soon to overtake them. It is for these pur-oses (hat this Bill is now before you, and I ope it either is, or by your assistance will be made such, as may nilly answer the ends for which you Were pleased to order it to be brought in.

“The abuses in the manner of dispatching your writs to the sheriffs, were the motives which first led you into this consideration. I am persuaded the method here prescribed to regulate

1722>-thiFreedom of Election*. £959

that matter, will be found so easy and practicable, and so little liable to any objection, that it would be ueedless in me to take up your time in enlarging upon that head. But for the penalties upon false returns, unless they are settled on the severest and most rigorous terms* it will be in vain for you to contend with sheriffs and returning officers, who, instead of the people in whom the right is and ought to be lodged, will draw the whole power of elections into their own hands, and therefore they ought to e btyed up to such strict rules, as that they shall never dare, upon any account whatsoever to depart from them, touch less to be subject to those sort of influences, which, of all others, ou have most reason to be jealous of. We now that persons heretofore have not only bribed the returning officer, but have even indemnified him against the whole penalty of 500/. rather thau not get the return, right or wrong, in favour of themselves; depending, I suppose, upon the strength -and partiality of their friends, to maintain them, at any rate, in the unjustifiable possession of a seat here; this has been practised upon former occasions, and therefore there is always just grounds to suspect it will be attempted again. And it is now emue to such a pass, that if you were even to double that penalty, without doing something else, I am’afraid it would have little or no effect. But when all those bonds of indemnity are declared null and void, when the securities usually given and taken upon these occasions are withdrawn, they may then, per^ haps, be deterred, at least from so barefaced a practice of these arbitrary and illegal proceedings for the future.

“ Another expedient for securing the fre»-dotn of your elections, and which, I think, will more effectually contribute towards it, than any one thing whatsoever, is the annulling the votes of those swarms of officers in the customs and excise; they are already subjected to the penalty . of 100/. if they shall presume to intermeddle; this therefore is no more than a natural consequence, and a necessary enforcement of what you have done before. The commissioners themselves of those brandies of the revenue have been for some time under a legal incapacity of sitting here, as being thought under such strong ties and influences, in regard to their employments, as were inconsistent with that freedom with which men ought to act in parliament; certainly then the same reason will hold good as to the votes of them and their inferior officers, especially in matters that so nearly relate to it. There is likewise a proviso, that no person shall be capable of possessing any of these offices, for a certain time to be limited, after they shall have tendered their votes in any election; and the reahon of that is very plain; without it all this disability would signify nothing; for by displ acing t' em just to serve a turn, and restoring them atain immediately after, the whole force oftliis c!au:e would be entirely defeated.

“ I make no doubt but the intention was vtv *

551] PAUL. HISTORY, 8 George

iust -and commendable of the gentlemen who brought in the Qualification Act, which was certainly designed to establish a landed property in parliament, without which, I will venture to say, it will be impossible you should he safe; but that matter stands at present upon so loose a foot, that I am afraid it has hitherto keen of very little pse or service to you. What dependence, for instance, can you have upon a man who has no more than 300/. a year in land, or, perhaps, only an annuity of that value for life, and has at the same time 30 or 40,000l. in the funds, or an employment of 2 or 3,000l. a year civil or military from the crown? And even that small qualification is no otherwise obligatory upon him, but merely to swear to his having it, if it be required, at the time of' his election; for though he sells it, or otherwise divests himself of it immediately after, yet it remains a doubt, whether, by so doing, he shall vacate his seat in parliament. This is certainly such an omission as requires to be better regulated and explained. There is likewise a saving m that act in favour of eldest sons of peers, and the same for those of commoners of 600/. a year; but I confess I am at a loss to fiud oat upon what grounds the latter was inserted, unless care had- been taken at the same time to have obliged the father or the son to have proved the possession of such an estate: for at present, let the circumstances of the family be what they will, if- the eldest son can procure himself to be elected, I cannot see but he is intitled to a seat here, without any farther examination whatsoever. This is another defect so gross in your former act, and opens a back door to so many persons, so intirely contrary to the intent and meaning of it, that it very well justifies the repeal of it by this bill, I mean so far only as relates to the eldest sons of commoners.

“ Whether the House will be willing to enact it by a clause, must be submitted to

them, I only take the liberty to mention, that it were very much to be wished, that gentlemen of estates and families in the country would heartily unite in this particular, of keeping the elections in their several counties among themselves; that they would resolve inviolably to support each other’s interest against the incroachments and corrupt applications of strangers, let them come from what quarter they will. If this were done, it would, in a great measure, put an end to those dangerous and infamous practices that are now on foot, and we might hope once more to see this House filled with gentlemen of free and independent fortunes, such as would be above making their court any where at the expence of their country, and would despise all manner of slavish concessions to men in power; ministers would then be neither able to screen themselves, or their friends, against your inquiries; and the boldest and most enterprising of them would be made to-tremble at the apprehensions of your animadversions upon them; nor should we

then, itis to be hoped, sit tamely here, and see

1.1722. — Bill for bettor Securing [955

our country harrassed with the expences of fruitless expeditions abroad, and with the maintenance of a standing army at home dan* gerous to our constitution and liberties.

“ There are other parts of this biH, which I had like to have omitted to have spoken to, which are designed, if possible, to put a stop to that torrent of bribery and corruption, which the iniquity of the times has let in upon you; and though I have very little prospect of any good effect that way, and whatsoever the fate of this bill may be, every gentleman, I dare swear, will so far agree, that some method should be taken to prevent such practices, or the kingdom must be undone. If at this time you had men at the head of your administration, who had ever been charged with, or any way convicted of such crimes, 1 own it would be in vain to propose this, or any other method, to punish and discourage it. Were it possible to believe, that the influences of such men could

}) re vail here, or in any other branch of the egislature, it would then be no wonder to see this bill miscarry, or to hear it treated as a composition of absurdities, or as a violation of the birthrights of great numbers of his majesty’s best subjects. But at present this shall be no reason with me to anticipate so much ill fortune to it, since it is plain it could come before you with .no other view, but to restore the freedom and honour of parliament, to rescue the rights and liberties of our country, and to save, if it be possible, the poor remnant of our constitution. These are the considerations which occur to me in favour of this bill; and I humbly move you that it may be committed.”

Accordingly the said Bill was committed to -a Committee of the whole House.

Debate in the Lords on a Motion for the Instructions relating to the British Squadrons sent into the Baltic for several years />«$£.] Jan. 25. The order of the day, for the House to be in a Committee to take into farther consideration the causes of contracting so large a Navy Debt; and the Instruction to the said Committee that they do, in the first place, consider of the occasion of .that part of the said debt, which arises from having employed more men in the sea service in any year, than were provided for by parliament for such year, and from the not paying off all the seamen at winter, being called for, a motion was made,

“ That authentic Copies of the several Treaties, Instructions, and Orders, relating to the British squadrons being sent into the Baltic, for several years last past, be laid before the House, that the true occasion of that part of the Navy Debt, which the Committee is instructed to consider in the first place, may better appear, as also, that the Act of Settlement has not been infringed by these northern expeditions.”

Hereupon a debate ensued, wherein' lord Bathurst alledged, That the immense increase of the National Debt was owing to the. great number of ships that had been employed in the

kjy

953] PAUL. HISTORY, . 8 George I. 1722. — Freedom of Elections. [954

Baltic and Mediterranean; the great numbers of seamen in those ships, and the keeping those seamen in pay daring the wintier season; concluding, that, in his opinion, those extraordinary expences were not necessary for the service of Great Britain. His lordship was supported by the lord North and Grey, the earl Cowper, the earl of Strafford, the bishop of Rochester, the lord . Trevor, and the earl Coningsby:but they were opposed by the earl of Sunderland, lord Townsend, duke of Argyle, earl of Hay, and the duke of Newcastle.

Protest against rejecting it.~\ The question being put, it was resolved in the negative.

“ Dissentient '

“ 1. Because it being now admitted by the House, in the instruction given to the Committee, tlrat the Navy-Debt was increased by employing more men in the sea-service yearly than were provided for by parliament, and by the not paying them off in the winter; the intention of the House in that instruction must, in our opinion, manifestly be to direct the Committee to inquire into the true occasion and reasonableness of those services, by which the Navy-Debt was increased; and that end could not, we think, be any ways attained without a sight of those treaties, instructions and orders, upon which those services were founded, since the considering the occasion of an extraordinary acknowledged expence must, we conceive, imply an inquiry into the true causes for which such an expence was made? we did therefore think it necessary to desire copies of the treaties, instructions and orders relating to. the several Baltic expeditions, because without them we could not possibly learn the true reasons of those expeditious; and it seemed to us incongruous that the House should direct an inquiry, and uot contribute to it, by directing also those materials to hi- laid before the Committee, which alone could render such an inquiry effectual.

* 2. Because the want of such authentic papers and instructions could no ways, we think, be supplied by any verbal representations, that might he made by lords in the ministry, as facts occurred to their memory in the debate; this being no sntHcient foundation for any parliamentary inquiry, much less fur such a one as tends to approve, excuse, or blame the int-a-suies of those in po wer; since we cannot think it suitable either to the rules of reason or the dignity of tins House, to prooeed to resolutions relatng to the c *nduot oi ministers upon facts stated by n.e ministers themselves.

“ 3. Beonse morions for such papers and instruments have been requently made and complied with, nor hath any such motion ever-(as for as we can learn) till of late been refused.; the only paper included in the general ^notion that we thought any wavs doubtful whether we should obtain, was the lord Carteret’s instructions, which was moved for before, in this session, without success; however, we had hopes ef prevailing even for a eight of that paper,

when it became necessary, a3 we apprehend, to qualify the Committee of the whole House to do the work appointed by the House.

“ 4. Because the great increase of the Navy-Debt arose from the frequent sending of strong squadrons to the Baltic, and continuing them there at seasons of the year when the British Beet has seldom been known to be employed so far from home, and in so rugged a climate; and therefore we thought it reasonable to expect the fullest satisfaction in our inquiries into the' grounds of expeditions, which had been carried on in so unusual, expensive and hazardous a manner; which the more extraordinary pliey were, the more they needed, in every respect, to be cleared and justified, that misapprehensions prevailing without doors, in relation to these Northern transactions, might be rectified, and such precedents might not remain without the reasons on which they were founded; whereas we are now apprehensive, that any resolutions on this head may lose much of their weight and influence, should they be known 6) have been framed upon the facts barely asserted by the ministers, Vvithout evidence of any sort to prove the truth of those facts.

“ 5. Because one great view we had in our motion for those papers was to satisfy ourselves and others, that the Act of Settlement had been no ways infringed by those Northern expeditions; a point of the utmost consequence to the present establishment, and on which therefore all our care and circumspection ought to be employed: It is the birthright of the peerage, as to concur in the enacting all laws, so to inquire into the observation of them; and the more momentous the law is, the more it becomes us to consider how far it hath or hath not been violated; and one great inducement to our inquiry into the observation of that law, was the jealousy entertained (as we conceive) on that head, by many of his majesty’s good subjects, observing that the war in the North ended at last in a peace, which' stripped Sweden of all its best provinces, and confirmed the acquisition of them to the several Northern powers concerned, without any particular advantage. that we hear of, stipulated in behalf of Great-Britain, besides that of a new guarantee for the Protestant succession:A sight of the said treaties, instructions and orders might perhaps have dispelled these apprehensions; and therefore we thought it our duty to move for them, and to express ou? concern that such a motion was overruled; for we cannot think jthe argument used to discourage us from insisting on that motion (that it amounted to an inquiry whether the King had broke his Coronation oath) was consistent with the freedom of Parliamentary Debates, or agreeable to the known rules of our constitution, which free the crown from all blame, and suppose those only who give pernicious counsels answerable for the

fatal effects of them.--(Signed,) W. Ebor’,

Resolutions of the Lords touching the

Debt.] Then the House, according to order, was adjourned during pleasure, and put into the said Committee: And after some time spent therein, the House was resumed, and the *earl of Clarendon reported the two following Resolutions:

" 1. That it is the opinion of this Committee, that the employing great numbers of seamen for several years last past, more than were provided for by parliament, and thereby increasing the Debt of the Navy, was occasioned by services which either were pursuant to the previous advice, or had the subsequent approbation of one or both Houses of parliament, and which were also necessary for the safety of the kingdom, and the tranquillity of Europe.

“ 2. That the nature of the said services necessarily requiring some ef his majesty’s squadrons to be kept out the whole year, and detaining others abroad till the months of November or December; and it being requisite to fit out the said squadrons in the month of February or the beginning of March, in order to their sailing early in the spring, the paying them off, upon their return, was inconsistent with the due performance of those services; nor could the saving (if any) by such payment . have in any degree made amends for the ill consequences which must thereby have arisen from the disappointment to the service.”

Protest against the Jirst .] The

first of the said Resolutions being read a second time, the question was put, .whether to agree with the Committee in this Resolution ? It was resolved in the Affirmative:

* Dissentient

“1. Because this resolution seems to dash with the instruction from whence it sprung, which was to consider the occasion of the increase of the Navy-Debt thnt arose from employing more then in the sea-service than were provided for by parliament; whereas from the resolution it appears only, that the services occasioned the debt, not what real occasion or reason there was for those services, which yet was the point we suppose chiefly in view, and most worthy of a parliamentary inquiry.

“2. Because those services are, in this resolution, supposed to be justified by the previous advice or subsequent approbation of one or both Houses ofParliament: whereas it did not any way appear to us that either House of Parliament had previously advised, or subsequently approved such services, though the vouchers in that respect were often and earnestly required; nor doth it appear to us, how that assertion is warranted, either by general expressions in votes and addresses, or by a state of the Navy-Debt communicated every year to the parliament; and therefore being still in the dark, as

to the evidence pointed at, we could wish that the growth of the Navy-^)ebt had been explained and justified by an inquiry into the ends and reasons for which it was contracted; but this way not being taken nor being possible to be taken, till the treaties, - instructions and orders requisite to this purpose are produced, we know not in what sense either those sea-services, or that great Navy-Debt they caused, may be said to have been approved by this or the other House of Parliament.

3. “ But had we been duly informed of the true motives upon which those services were undertaken, and thereby enabled to judge of their reasonableness, (as, we think, we in no degree were) yet we still must be of opinion, that those considerations, how important soever, would not have justified the exceeding the number of men asked of and allowed by parliament, which nothing but absolute and unforeseen necessity can ever excuse; whereas the occasions of these extraordinary expences were foreseen, and the fleets were sent out for many years successively, (the parliament sitting) without any previous demands made of such supplies as were proportioned to the expence intended; and we are further of opinion, that whenever such a debt is unavoidably incurred, it should be especially stated to the parliament, together with the necessity that occasioned it, at their next assembling, that the excuse may be then either allowed or censured, and the exceedings provided for in time, instead of being offered to run on for many years together, till an insupportable debt is contracted, without any other notice taken of the reason of its growth, than the laying annually a general state of the debt on the tame of the House of Commons. This we conceive to have been the case, and, if it be, we think, we do not err in affirming, that had the services appeared to have been necessary, yet this manner of increasing the debt would not have been warranted.

4. “ Neither can we apprehend, how the safety of the kingdom depended upon those extraordinary services, some of which were performed in the Mediterranean, others in the Baltic, against powers not at enmity with Great-, Britain, whose friendship (it seems to us) we should rather have cultivated, and whose resentments we had, and still have (we fear) reason to apprehend:we cannot but tbink it the true interest of Great-Britain, to intermeddle as little as is possible in the quarrels of Europe; and then, by our gdod offices chiefly, without declaring any resolution to support our mediation by force, or making ourselves either principals or parties in wars that do not immedi*, ately concern us. We look upon our navy (the natural security of our Island) as too much hazarded, and somb chief branches of our trade as highly endangered, by the consequences of those remote expeditions; nor are we‘yet satisfied, that the peace; by us mediated and concluded in the North, hath not made the provision of Naval Stores for our fleet more

precarious than formerly, though on that single article the safety of the kingdom may possibly depend; nor can we judge the present tranquillity likely to last, since after all onr expence the late Northern Peace hath reduced Sweden so low, and left tin? Czar in the possession of such provinces as may render him very formidable; and what matters may still remain unadjusted in treaties, whereby the present tranquillity may soon be disturbed, we cannot determine, since we have not been indulged in our desire of inspecting into those treaties.

Protest against the second .] Then

the other Resolution being likewise read a second time, the question was put, whether to agree with the Committee in the said Resolution; it was resolved in the affirmative.

“ Dissentient *

1. “ Because that part of the question which concerns such of his majesty’s ships, as are said, but not proved, to hdve been necessarily kept out the whole year, has not the least relation, as we conceive, to any thing that has been yet objected to; which was the not paying ships that came home before winter, and ought, by the antient usage of the navy, to have been paid off, and therefore, we cannot but think, was very improperly made part of the question.

2. “ Because it being admitted in the question, that the ancient usage of the navy was, that all ships, when they returned home from their several voyages, should not be kept in pay during the winter, (as was the case of the late Baltic squadrons for some years past) and it not having been made appear, as we think1 in a parliamentary way, that by any treaty with Sweden it was necessary to sena ships sooner in any year, than might have been consistent with the said antient usage, we are of opinion, that the resolution will encourage the practice complained of, and will greatly contribute to make fleets, so much the honour and security of this kingdom, too chargeable to be supported.

3. M Because we cannot but be surprized, that there should be the least doubt, as in the question, whether any money might have been saved by paying off the men, when it appears by a paper upon the table, that several ship’s companies, [amounting to many thousands of men, have been kept in pay during the winter, which expence, we cannot hut think, ought to have been avoided, it appearing from other pa-

ers and representations upon the table, that y paying the men off, more than five parts in six of the whole charge of those men, during the winter, had been saved to the public.

4. “ Because a resolution of this House, that seems to countenance -a practice of this sort, (at

a time, when every way of getting money at the expence of the public, is found to be less in people's thoughts than formerly) may probably encourage those, who shall have opportunity in future times, too readily to contribute towards theencrease of Navy-Debts, though ‘they are attended with so many ill consequences, that his majesty, in a most gracious speech from the throne, has very lately been pleased to say, they do not only affect all public credit, bat greatly increase the charge and expence of the current service, and are, of all others, the most heavy and burthensome.----(Signed) W.

Debate in the Lords on the Motion, That Victualling the Ships abroad\zoas one Cause of the Increase of the Navy-Debt.] February 1. The Lords, in a grand committee, resumed the consideration of the Navy-Debt; and the debate was opened by The Earl of Uxbridge moving, That some Accounts and Orders, relating to. the Victuaf-ling, when the fleets were in the Baltic and Mediterranean, might be read. A fter the reading of those papers, his lordship endeavoured to shew, That one occasion of the increase of the Navy-Debt, was the ships being victualled abroad, by the commanders, and not by the proper officers of the Victualling Office, who are cheques upon one1 another; whereas the other way there might be great abuses, by commanders charging more to the government for the provisions, than they really cost.

The Lord Torrington thinking himself reflected upon, as he was commander in chief in the Mediterranean, endeavoured to justify himself from any imputation of that nature, and among other things alledged, That provisions were much dearer there than in England; that it was impossible to carry such quantities from hence, as would serve for any long time; and therefore they are obliged to buy them there at any rate.”

His Lordship was supported by the lord Townshend and the earl of Ilay; and though the earl Cowper, the lord Bathurst, the earl of Strafford, and the earl Coningsby backed the earl of Uxbridge, yet the question being put, “ That the Victualling his majesty’s ships by any other than the Victuallers appointed for that service, is contrary to the course of the navy, and by taking away the proper cheques, is one great cause of contracting so large a NavyT Debtit was resolved in the negative without dividing.

Protest against rejecting if.] “ Dissentient *

1. “ Because it being unquestionably the ancient coarse of the Navy to victual all his majesty's ships by the comm’9sioners of the Victualling or their agents, unless in cases of necessity; and it appearing to us, by a paper re-

959] PARL. HISTORY, A George 1.1722. — Protest on rising to .[960

turned before this House from the Victualling-Office, that many ships and squadrons of ships have of late years been victualled by the commanders, very few of which were so victualled by any order, and amongst those many instances a few only were excused, because there were no agents for the Victualling-Office, nor any stores in the places where the ships then were; we think it reasonable to conclude that all the several victuallings in the said paper contained being much the greater number, which were neither excused therein, nor. said to be ordered, were so provided without any order or excuse whatsoever; and consequently were a needless breach of the said good course of the navy, and by taking away the proper check made to save the public money must, in our opinion, necessarily have been one of the occasions of the increase of the Navy Debt.

2. “ We cannot but observe, that if the said excuse had (in the paper above-mentioned) been applied to all the several instances there of victualling, in a manner contrary to the course of the navy, yet it had been insufficient, since it is not alledged that agents for the victualling and stores might not have been timely had in the places where the ships were victualled, if due notice had been given to the commissioners of the Victualling, and proper precautions' and endeavours had been used to that end.

3. “ We cannot but think, that carrying this question in the negative will undoubtedly encourage this breach of the course of the navy, as it is acknowledged to be, and in consequence put it into the power of every admiral or commander in chief of any squadron, and every commander of a particular ship, not only to furnish such provisions, both in quantity and quality, as the, y shall think fit, but by letting the men go on shore when in port, on pretence of supplying provisions, leave a charge on the public for want of the proper check, though to the detriment of the sea service.

4. “ Because by this leave given to the commanders on the head of victualling they have it in their power (through the want of the said true and ancient check) to bring a very great charge upon the head of wages, which must undoubtedly, as we apprehend* occasion a great waste of the public treasure, and consequently an increase of the Navy-Debt.

5. "Because, we think, that to suppose the commander of any squadron or ship will not* when it is so entirely in his power, do what shall be for his interest, is to believe him less inclined to his interest than the generality of his fellow-subjects on shore.

6. “ Because, we believe, if this House will not discourage taking away proper checks, till proof had (as urged in the debate) of what bad been got by individuals for want of those checks, the delay and difficulties attending such an inquiry will probably hinder any discouragement being given to such practices, which are allowed to be contrary to the standing instructions to the commissioners of the Victualling, nnd to the commanders of his majesty's

Protest on refusing to adjourn the

Lord Chancellor came late to the House.] Feb.

3. The Lord Chancellor not coining to the House till the Lords had been met above two hours, and not having sent to the lord chief justice King, whom his majesty, by letters patent under the great seal, entered in the journal, had authorised to supply the place of the Lord Chancellor, in his lordship’s absence,

Earl Cowper moved, That in order to go

upon the business of the day, they should pro* ceed to the choice of a Speaker, pro interim; and the dukes of Somerset and Kingston were named, but these going out or the House to avoid it, the lord Lechmere was named next, and like to be chosen; while this matter was debating,

The Lord Chancellor came in, and observing some uneasiness among the Lords, acquainted the House, “ That he, having been summoned to attend his majesty at St. James’s, had accordingly waited upon his majesty there, where he was detained, longer than be could foresee, by his majesty's command; and that as soon as he was at liberty, he came hither with the utmost expedition; and asked pardon for his stay of the Lords, who had been so long kept in expectation of him."

Several lords would not admit of that excuse, but suggested. That the House of Peers, being the greatest council in the kingdom, to which all other councils ought to give way, ought not to be made, to wait on any account; and therefore moved, That, in order to shew their resentment, the House should adjourn to the Monday following; but the question being put thereupon, was carrried in the negative, by 49 voices against 31.

Hereupon the following Protest was entered *•

* Dissentient' u 1. Because the House standing adjourned to this day at eleven o’clock, and a great number of lords being met, and expecting the coming of their Speaker till near three o’clock, they seemed to us generally to resent this usage, and without any dissent, that we could perceive, proceeded, according to the standing order of this House, towards chusing a Speaker; but meeting with some difficulties as to the persons nominated, the Lord Chancellor came before any choice made; and as soon as the House was sat, the Lord Chancellor alledged, as- the reason of his long absence, that be had been summoned to attend his majesty at St. James’s, where the business had lasted much longer than was expected; which excuse, though it might in great measure free the Lord Chancellor from the imputation of wilful neglect of duty, yet it seemed to us in no degree to justify the indignity which we think was upon the whole

shatter done to the House, which is undoubtedly the greatest council in the kingdom, to which all other councils ought to give way, and not that to any other; and therefore the business of any other council -ought not to have detained the Speaker of this House after the hour appointed for its meeting, and during the time Of the day the House has usually of late spent in business; and therefore we thought the least resentment the House could shew on this occasion, to prevent its being used so for the future, was to adjourn without entering On any business:and this the rather, because we foresaw it could not obstruct any public affairs, 'since the time wus so far spent, as that no business of consequence could well have been gone through with effect, though entered upon.

“ 8. As we may venture to say, that the dignity of this House has nbt been of late years increasing, so we are unwilling that any thing, we conceive to be a gross neglect of it, should pass without some note on our records, that we were sensible of such neglect, and did not approve it; which we thought would have been in some measure attained by an immediate adjournment, nor was any other method proposed; and since that could not he effected we enter this dissent, with our Reasons, that it may appear to posterity we were zealous to withstand, tii a manner proposed, the further prpgt ess of a pr-icuce so injurious, as we conceive, to the hon< >ur and authority of this supreme council. — (Signed,) W.

one of the barons of the Exchequer, with endeavouring to corrupt the borough of Banbury in the county ofOxon, in order, ta procure sir William Codrington to be chosen a representative for the said borough in the ensuing elec- i tion. The sum of tins Charge was, that Mr. Baron Page had not only offered to the said Corporation to forgive them six or seyen hundred pounds, they owed him for their new chan* ter, but likewise to give them another large suns in ready, money, which sir John Cope having offered to prove by undeniable evidence, set the whole House into a flame; and some members were for censuring the Baron immediately; but

Mr. Robert Walpole moderated that heat» representing, 44 That it was unreasonable to arraign, condemn, and censure a man, especially one in so eminent a station, before they heard what he had to say in his own viudication; and besides, that it would look like prejudging the merits Of the election of that borough; and ' therefore he'was of opinion, they ought not to take any notice of that Complaint, until the election was over, and then, if any thing of that nature appeared, the House might proceed to censure as they should think fit.”

He was supported by several other members of the Court-Party, who alledged, That when they should hear what Mr. Bajron Page had to say for himself, the matter might appear quite otherwise; and that the gentleman who accused fiira, might be either misinformed, or imposed upon. Hereupon the matter of the said Charge was ordered to be heard at the bar of the House the 13th.

Sir John Cope accordingly delivered the said Charge in writing, to the clerk of this House: Which is as follows; viz. ‘

Ordered, That sir John Cope, and Mr. Baron Page, be heard at the bar of this House, by their counsel, upon the matter of the said Charge, if they think fit.

The Charge against Mr. Baron Page heard.]

. February 13. The House went upon the Complaint of sir John Cope, hart, against Mr. Baron Page, for endeavouring to corrupt several of the leading members of the Corporation of Banbury against the nett election; and to aggravate the matter, sir John Cope acquainted the House, that he was informed, that some of his Evidences had been tampered with; and that there was one Mr. Gregory at the door, who could give the House au account thereof. Mr. Gregory having thereupon been called in, and examined, sir John Cope moved, That the matter of the said Charge might be referred to the consideration of a committee, upon oath; but this was opposed by the Courtiers, who urged, That the said Complaint was already ordered to be heard at the bar of this House this day, and the question being put, that the hearing the matter of the said Charge at the bar of this House be discharged, it was carried in the negative by 176 voices against 135.

Then sir John Cope moved, and the question was proposed, That the Witnesses to be examined in the matter of this Charge, be examined at the bar of this House in the most solemn manner; but. the previous question being

treated him with his usual insolence and severity, and when he had summed up the evidence, endeavoured to exasperate the jury, as Mr. Savage used to relate it, with this eloquent harangue:

41 Gentlemen of the jury; you are to consider,

* that Mr. Savage is a very great man, a much

* greater man than, you or I, gentlemen of the

* jury; that he wears very fine clothes, much

* finer clothes than you or I, gentlemen of the jury; that he has abundance of money in his

* pocket, much more money than you or I,

* gentlemen of the jury; but, gentlemen of the

* jury, is it not a very bkrd case, gentlemen of the jury, that Mr. Savage should therefore kill

* you or me, gentlemen of the jury. '

“ Mr. Savage, hearing his defence thus misrepresented, and the men who were to decide his fate, incited against him by invidious comparisons, resolutely asserted, that his case was not candidly explained, and began to recapitulate what he had before said with regard to his condition, and the necessity of endeavouring to escape the expences-of imprisonment; but the judge haying ordered him to be silent, and repeated his orders without effect, commanded that he should be taken away from the bar by force.” — Dr. Johnson’s Life of Savage.

uSavage always continued to speak with

* nger of the insolence and partiality of Page,

put. That the question be now put, it passed in the negative by 144 votes against 142.

Then the Counsel for Mr. Baron Page being called in, and the Charge of sir John Cope against him read, the mayor of Banbury, and other witnesses, were called in, and examined by sir John Cope; after which, the Counsel for Mr. Baron Page was heard, and a witness examined.

The Witnesses for sir John Cope declared. That Mr. Baron Page being with sir Adolphus Oughton, and sir William Codrington in the Town-Hall at Banbury, Mr. Baron Page called the mayor and two or three of the aldermen into another room, and discoursing with them about a person to be set up at the next election to represent the Corporation, he proposed to them/ sir William Codrington. That they answered. They would be very glad to.accept one of his recommendation; but adijed, That most other corporations made a considerable advantage of their elections; and they knew no reason why they should not do it as well as their neighbours; that they wanted to have their streets paved, an augmentation to their vicarage, and a school to be built; which the Corporation not being able to do of themselves, their stock being very low, they therefore expected, that the person who should be chosen should be at that expence, which, in all, might amount to 500/. or 600/. That thereupon the Baron told them, he did not expect such &n answer; that they knew be had been very kind to the Corporation, and had been at a great charge, no less than 600/. or 700/. to procure them a new charter; that he never intended to ask that money of them, and if they would

After the farther examining of Witnesses, and hearing of Mr. Baron Page’s Counsel, a motion being made, and the question put, That it appeared to this Hoose, that sir John Cope, bart. had made good his Charge against sir Francis Page, one of the Barons of his majesty’s Exchequer, it was, after long debate, carried in the negative, by 128 votes only against 124.

Debate in the Commons on the Bill to enable the South Sea Company to dispose of their Effectst Ac.] February 16. The House went into a Committee upon a Bill, ‘ To enable the South

* Sea Company to dispose of the Effects in their

* hands by way of lottery or subscription, in

* order to pay the debts of the said Company.’ Sir Thomas Cross being in the chair,

Mr. Egbert Walpole offered a clause to be added to the Bill, To impower the South-Sea Company to dispose of part of their capital

* fund, not exceeding 200,000l. per annum, to

* any persons, body politic or corporate, to

* enable them to pay their debts. *

This clause was very strenuously opposed by Mr. Archibald Hutcheson, the lord Morpeth, general Ross, and Mr. Pulteney; who suggest-. ed, That this was but an ingraftment in other terms: that the South-Sea Company had desired no such power; but if they had it, the Directors would not fail making use of it, whether there was any occasion for it or not.

Mr. Walpole replied, He perceived, that because he bad once declared himself in favour of an Ingraftment, every thing he proposed since appeared frightful, as though he were in -‘the interest of another company, and not in that of the South-Sea; but that he took that opportunity to declare, that he had no manner of Concern in the Bank, where, for a long time, he had not had one penny; whereas he had, at this very juncture, a considerable stock in the South*Sea Company, and therefore had reason to be for the interest of the latter, if he considered only his own; hut that in this whole affair, he had the public good principally in view: and although he had been so much rejected on for being for an ingraftment, yet he wduld undertake to prove to any two unprejudiced gentlemen in that House, as plainly as figures' could do, that an Ingraftment had been for the interest and advantage of the South-Sea Company. That as to this clause, he could not imagine, why any one concerned in the said Company, should be against their having, ♦as much power as they could, since it was in their choice, whether they would make use of it or not: that considering the present circum-

fuilt of perjury. He was answered by lord forth and Grey, lord Trevor, the bishop of Rochester, and the earl of Strafford; but the earl of Sunderland replied to them, and was supported by the lord Townshend, and the duke of Argyle.

“ 1. Because the methods of corruption made use of io elections, and now grown to an height beyond the example af preceding times, are, of ^ll others, the greatest hlemish to our constitution, and must, if not remedied, prove fatal tp it; and did therefore chiefly deserve, as they can only admit of, a parliamentary cure.

“ 2. Because the Commons, who are the best qualified to judge of the growth of this evil, and to point out proper remedies for it, having sent up a Bill complaining of the one, ' And desiring our assistance in the other, it was not, we apprehend, suitable to the dignky and wisdom of this House to reject such a biff, 'without entering into a free discussion of the particulars of which if consisted, and thereby to give an handle for reflections without doors, as if we had shewn a less degree of zeal against the corruptions complained of than those from whose elections it sprung; oAr opinion is, thpt we should rather have taken this favourable opportunity of joining our endeavours with theirs, towards the core of this evil, than have made ourselves liable to objections for refusing to attempt it, even after puch an encouraging step taken by the House of Commons.

“ 3. Because a law against corruption,

\

, 507] PARL.. HISTORY, 8 George I. 17 on rejecting tie Bill - [5081

though always desirable, is yet particularly seasonable and necessary at such a juncture as this, when new elections of members are com* ing on, and the parliament for which they shall (by what methods soever) be chosen, may continue for seven years; and, we think, the Lords are the more concerned to obviate the ill consequences of such a choice, because the Septennial-Act, which made so remarkable a change in our constitution, had its rise in this House.

“ 4. Because we are persuaded, that by the terror of the penalties contained in this 'bill, which were to have operated soon after it had passed into a law, a mighty check would have been given to the growth of corruption, though it should not have been absolutely cured; and we are confirmed in this opinion by what we heard and believe, that while the bill was depending in parliament, and the fate of it unknown, the impious practices at which it was levelled were in some measure suspended; and should fe further stop have been put to corruption and bribery at the approaching elections, bypassing this bill, such a degree of success might have given the legislature hopes of an entire suppression of it.

“ 5. Because supposing this bill to have been defective in some respects, and, not well adjusted iu others to the end designed (a supposition made, but not admitted by us) yet the true way of supplying all these defects, and making all proper alterations, would have been by committing the bill, and not by rejecting it: In other c »$es, where a bill of publio concern is laid aside by the House, they can easily make amends for that loss by bringing in a new one, which may more effectually answer the good ends proposed; whereas in this case there is neither time, sufficient for repeating the attempt, nor can any bill of this kind be ever begun in this House with any reasonable prospect of success.

“ 6. Because the intention of many chief clauses in the bill is to provide for the more effectual execution of laws already made to secure the freedom of elections, but hitherto evaded for want of such provisionsand we know hot that any argument hath been or can be used against passing such parts of this bill into a law, but what may with equal or greater strength be urged for repealing those laws, which yet are held sacred and inviolable.

“ 7. Because several oaths are, by laws now in being, required to qualify electors, and the oaths enjoined by this bill are intended only to strengthen the obligations under which suck electors do, by the knoyvn rules of our constitution, already lie; nor are these oaths attended with any new hardship or difficulty, since they relate only to plain matters of fact, which are certainly known to the electors themselves, and which they will he ready to attest with all solemnity, if they are conscious of their own innocence; and " they are not, the legal punishment of perjury to whiph they ^ra subjected is light, in coqipttispn of the

heinous nature of their offence, and the mischievous consequences of it.

“ 8. Because that part of the bill, whiclt forbids the issuing of public money towards influencing elections, relates to a method of corruption, which, of all others, ought the most carefully to be guarded against, and yet was admitted in the debate to tiave been frequently practised; and therefore we cannot but wish, that this bill bad been passed into a law for the sake of that clause, which would have hindered what was given for the security of the subjects rights, and the safety of the kingdom, from being ever employed to the destruction of both: An example, if thus set by meu in high offices and stations, cannot fail of spreading its influence through all ranks and orders of men, and procuring impunity and applause for such practices, . as all true lovers of their country must wish, might be universally detested and punished.

“ 9. Because we cannot understand bow the objection made to this bill (That it removes foundations) can, with any colour of reason, be supported; on the contrary, we think, that the whole design of it is to recover our old constitution, and resettle it on those firm foundations from which it has been removed, ever since bribery has been made an usupl inlet to parliament, and that dangerous traffic has b*ei) carried on between the electors and the elected, which has undermined the virtuous principles, and may prove fatal to the liberties of the tree people of this realm.

“ 10. Because another argument insisted on in prejudice of the bill, (That it would give the House of Commons greater latitude in deciding disputed elections) seems to us to be equally grouudless; for the penalties intended to be enacted by this bill are to take place only upon prosecutions in the ordinary courts of justice, aitd cannot come under the cognizance, or be indicted by the authority of the House of Commons; nor can the courts below be checked in their proceedings on this head by the determinations of that House, with which the methods of punishing corruption, prescribed by this bill, do notin the least interfere: What therefore was al-1 edged in the debate can by no means be allowed, (That while the Commons are the sole judges of elections, it is in vajn to think of restraining the corruption of electors) since the methods here prescribed are such, as either operate upon the conscience, or will, in the common course of law, execute themselves; and though they may be forwarded, yet cannot be frustrated by the intervention of an House of Commons.

“11. Because as the passing this bill would have been attended with no inconveniencies to the public, so great mischiefs may, we apprehend, ensue upon the rejecting it: The honour of this House may suffer oh that accopnt, and corruption of all sorts, will, we fear, receive new life and encouragement: it being a matter of daily and certain observation, that whenever a bill is brought into parliament to redress apy great disorders in the state, any discotrate-nap9£ given to such a bill will always couiltf-

The said Protest expungedIn the course of this debate the earl of Sunderland having suggested, .That it had been a common thing in former reigns for money to be issued out of the Treasury, find even remitted from France, for promoting the election of persons in the court interest. This suggestion was the reason of inserting in the said Protest these Expressions,

* That the issuing of public money towards the

* most carefully, to be guarded against, and yet 4wa# admitted, in the debate, to have been 4frequently practised/ On the 19th,

The Earl of Sunderland look from thence occasion to represent. That every member of that illustrious assembly, had, indeed, a right to dissene from, and protest against any Bill depending, or any Resolution taken in the House; but that it was an intolerable abuse to wrest any mau’s words, and put false constructions upon them, as bad been done in an instance relating to himself: that he durst appeal to any lord in She House, that was not a Protester, whether, in the debate about the Bill above-mentioned, he said, or intimated, that the issuing public money for elections had ever been practised in "this reign; for what he meant, was only in king Charles's and king James’s time. His lordship added, that the business of Protests was ipa-naged now after another manner than formerly; for, at present, it was grown customary to protest even against bills that were passed into a law, and to get them printed, and handed about m coffee-houses, and sent all over the kingdom, to inflame the minds of the people against the administration; and therefore he thought it high time to have the method of Protesting regulated.

' This speech was answered by the earl Cowper, who was backed by the ford North and Grey, lord bishop of Rochester, lord Bathurst, earl of Strafford, and earl of Aylesford; but they were replied to by the earl of Sunderland, duke of Wharton, lord Townshend, duke of Argyle, lord Carteret, lord Harcourt, and the duke of Newcastle, which last moved, for taking into consideration the Protestation entered in the Journal of ibis House the 13th io-|Unt, (fijetting llg.&D#.* ptounag

Protest against adjourning the Consideration of the Navy-Debt.J Then the order of the

day for the House to be iu a committee again, to take into farther consideration the Causes of contracting so large a Navy-Debt, being read, the question was pat, That the House be put into a committee again, to take into farther Consideration the Causes of contracting so large a Navy-Debt, on this day three weeks; it was resolved in the affirmative:

u Disseutient *

1. “ Because the putting off the farther consideration of the causes of the- Navy-Debt, Us so distant a day, after so long au adjournment of the same mutter already had, is, as we conceive, not only a discouragement and delay, but, as the session may happen to end, will totally prevent, at least during this session, that) inquiry, which, as we apprehend, would greatly have tended to the public good, iu hindering so large a Navy-Debt from being oenicacted foe the future.

2. “ Although the said inquiry has been a great while depending, yet a very few days, a* appears by the Journal, have been allowed for it, and one of those was.employed in reviewing two questions, which were at-first kept from; being put, by previous, question*; and therefor we conceive, days now ought agt

* 71] PAUL. HISTORY, 8 George I. Debate the Lords [97 *

to have been denied, for the looking into a mat* ter of so very great importance to the public.

3. “We apprehend, that all matters properly brought before either House of Parlia* ment, especially inquiries iuto mismanagements of the public business, ought, if the time will allow it, to be freely and folly discussed and determined one way or other, and ought not to be kept off from coming to any determination, by one long aryournment after another, till the session be ended.

4. “ Because it was alledged in the debate, as a Reason against so long an adjournment, That the subject-matter of the inquiry was not near exhausted; and that the points already considered and determined had no relation to those proposed to be considered in the farther inquiry; and consequently the determination of the former could in no degree prejudice the latter, or make the going upon them needless or improper: and to evince this, several of the particulars designed to have been proceeded upon were specified; as,

“ That it appeared by extracts of several letters on the table, especially by a letter from the Navy-Board, dated the 13th of Feb. 1701, that the practice of turqing over companies, or part of companies, from one ship to another, without their officers, was a charge to the crown, by confounding accounts, and otherwise, as well as disgustful to the seamen.

“ That by <5ther papers before the House, it appeared, that several squadrons have gone out of late without muster-masters, whose office and duty it is to detect frauds in pay, and on the head of victualling.

“ That in the year 1720, 2, 201 men were employed in the yards more than in the year 1714, and 2, 627 men more than in the year 1698, and that the wages of those men have of late been greatly increased; both which, for aught appeared to us, are an unaccountable increase of that charge to the public.

“ That since the, year 1714, many new captains and lieutenants had been made, while great numbers have been kept in half-pay and unemployed, besides those created on vacancies which happened while the ships were abroad, and by that means an unnecessary charge has been continued on the public, and the elder officers disobliged.

“ That without any order or establishment by his majesty in council, pay has been allowed, contrary to the usage of the navy, to flag-officers at home during the winter, on pretence of their making a journey or two to see their squadrons equipped.

“ That without such order or establishment of his majesty in council, captains and commanders of small numbers of ships have been paid as rear-admirals, on pretence of having captains under them; and in but one instance* that we could observe, a reason given why they bad captains under them, unless it was to colour their having such pay.

“ And we are well assured, that, on farther inquiry, it will appear that new lieutenants have

been made abroad, and old ones fit to serve, . sent home to be put in half-pay.

“ That flags have been paid in double and treble capacities. That flags and other officers have been paid as in higher stations than those they served in. That two or three flags of the same sort have been paid at the same time. That retrospections of pay have been allowed to flag and other officers.

“ All which being against the ancient (economy of the navy, and wasteful of the public treasure, we think, should have been inquired into without loss of time.

“ These Mismanagements, as we take then! to be, and others, which might have appeared on farther consideration of this matter, contributing, as we apprehend, to waste the public treasure, must necessarily have been in a great degree, an occasion of contracting so large a Navy-Debt; and therefore we are of opinion, that one or more farther days, which would probably have fallen within this session, should nave been appointed for the taking them into, consideration; which hot being done, we the rather enter this Protest, with our reasons, as what, we hope, may give an occasion to the re-(suming the thoughts of this matter in another

session of parliament.---(Signed, } W. Ebor',

Debate in the Lords on the National Feb. 20. The Lords took into consideration the National-Debt, and Earl Cowper took notice, how much the same bad been encreased for several years past, as appeared by the state of the public debt, extracted from the books of the treasury, and this without any visible occasion* since every thing that had been.asked of the parliament, had been readily granted and provided for, every one of those years; and therefore his lordship moved, “ That it appears by the state of the Public Debt before this House, -that the same (exclusive of the debt of the navy) is, increased between the 31st of December 1717, and the Sist of December 1720, at least the 6um of 2, 300,000l. notwithstanding that the sinking fund has produced within that time 1, 910, 385/. 14s. 6fd.” This motion, was seconded by the lord Bathurst, and supported by the lords Bingley, Trevor, and North ana Grey: but they were all strenuously opposed by the lord Carteret, and Townshend, the earl of Ilay, the earl of Sunderland, the bishop of Sarum, and the earl of Scarborough, so that the question being put upon the said motion, it was carried in the negative by 50 voices* against 23.

is not reasonable to be presumed, that the officers of the crown would state the debt higher than it really was, so we, cannot but think that nothing was alledged in the debate that made it appear the debt was less than stated in the question; but on the contrary, had the exact quantum of the debt been material to liave been inquired into on this occasion, it was evident to us, even from a memorandum at the bottom of the same paper, that the debt was, in reality, much higher the 31st of December,

The same day a motion was made, That the lessening the Public Debt annually, by all proper methods, is necessary to the restoring and preserving the Public Credit." And a

auestion being stated thereupon, after debate, ie previous question was put, whether the said question shall be now put r It was resolved in the negative.

“ Dissentient ’

" 1.' Because as the main question is undeniably true, and seems to us admitted to be so, by its being prevented to be put by the previous question, so we think it would have been highly expedient and useful to the public to have had it put and voted in the affirmative, that by the declared opinion of this House (which must always be of the greatest authority) those, who are more immediately concerned to take care of the Public Credit, might not rely on vain and deceitful projects for restoring and preserving the credit of the nation, but apply themselves seriously and diligently to bring about the only effectual means of doing it.

“ 2. Although so clear and evident a truth, as is contained in the main question, cannot when proposed but obtain the consent of all, especially of such as are qualified to be in great stations, yet at this juncture, when the public is under such great necessities from the unexampled pressure of debts, and when all other remedies hitherto attempted have proved ineffectual, if not mischievous, we cannot but conceive it was extremely proper, and must have greatly conduced to the restoring and preserving the Public Credit, to have quickened the endeavours for that purpose of all in the public service, by so high an authority as a resolution of this House, not only pointing out to them the way they should take towards (hat good end, but intimating also, that as far as is possible to be attained, the doing so would be expected from them.

“ And therefore we conceive, the main question should have been, put and voted (as we

Debate an a Motion for limiting the Time for entering Protests.'] February 27. The

earl of Sunderland took notice, That the privilege of entering Protests, had of late been so much abused, that, in his opinion, some restraint ought to be put to it, by limiting the time for entering Protestations, upon asking leave of the House, which was never denied: and therefore he moved, Ci That such Lords as shall enter their Protestations with Reasons ', shall do the same before two o’clock the next sitting day, and sign them before the House rises." This was opposed by lord Cowper, who alledged. That the time being so short; and very few lords coming so early, such an Order would, in effect, put an end to all protesting, which was an ancient privilege of that House. The b|phop of Rochester added, That if Protests were limited to so short a time, this was, at least, the way to ljave them crude and undigested; and he thought it unbecoming the dignity of that august^assembly to have any thipg entered upon their Journals, which were records for after-ages, before it had been duly considered on and well digested. He was supported by the lords Bathurst, North and Grey and Trevor: but they were opposed by the lords Townshend and Onslow, the earl of Sunderland and the bishop of Peterborough, the duke of Argyle and the lord Carteret; and the question being put upon the said motion, it was resolved in the affirmative by 48 voices against 18; and an Order was made, pursuant to the said Resolution. Then a motion was made, That the said Order be made a Standing Order of the House, See. but the debate on that motion was adjourned to the 3rd of March, when all the lords were ordered to be summoned.

Protest against passing a BUI relating ning of Goods.] March 2. The Lords read a second time an ingrossed bill from the Commons, To prevent the clandestine running of Goods, ’ &c. And the question being put, whether the bill do pass, it was resolved in the affirmative, by 36 against 19.

u Dissentient ’

u 1. Because we are very sensible of the ill consequences that attend the pernicious practice of running of goods; and therefore wish some reasonable, proper and effectual method (which we do not take this Bill to be) might have been set on foot to prevent it.

“ 2. Because the making the alteration, by a former bill, from ships of 15 tun to those of 30, has not proved of any advantage, as we apprehend, 6ince it has been admitted (bat the customs have fallen since; and we find a *

#75] PARL. fil&TORY, 8 George I. 1722. — StandingOrder Proteste. (976

ground to hope, that the farther raising the prohibition to Ships of 40 ton, as is done by this bill, fill be effectual; but, we think, there is reason to fear that it may be a great prejudice to the coasting-trade in particular, since the bwtiers of such vessel* are thereby subjected to the heavy penalty of losing their ships, when possibly, they may be entirely innocent themselves, and the fault may be committed only through the folly or knavery of the sailors, which will discourage the lending small vessels to those who trade in them, by which a great part of the coast-trade is at present carried on.

“ 3. Because the penalty of banishment in the bill seems, in some cases, to be annexed to a very small offence: we do not think it too great for any one who shall he taken with goods of any considerable value, and with a manifest intent to defraud his majesty of his customs; but as the bill is worded, it will, as wb conceive, extend to any gentleman, if armed, returning from his travels, who has about him knowingly the least trifle that has not .been entered and paid duty, though he has not the least design to defrauu the king of his customs, or thinks he is transgressing any law whatsoever; and we do not think fit to de-. pend, that so severe a law may not, in such Lard cases, be sometimes executed with rigour.

“ 4. Because it was endeavoured, but with- out 'success, at the Committee, to have excepted the barges of noblemen and of the lord mayor and companies of. the city of London, wbtcfa.canuot be supposed to be used (and the great barges of state belonging to the city cannot be used) in the running of goods; and therefore, we conceive, the making it necessary - for the nobility, or the lord mayor and comr panies to apply to the admiralty, for a licence to u?e their own barges on the river Thames, or lay aside the use of them for want of such licences, which cannot be obtained without giving such a security as will bind and incumber the real estates of the obligors, to be not only a great and unnecessary indignity, but also an invasion of property, especially in the case* of the barges belonging to the city of London, which city has an ancient right to the conservation of the river Thames, and as high an interest in it as is possible to be had in any navigable river; and therefore we think it absurd, as-Well as injurious to property, to compel the great officers and companies of that city to ask and give security for a licence to navigate or pass on that part of the Thames, Which may not improperly be called their own river.

“ 5. It Seems to us partial and unjust, that the prohibition of barges and other vessels described m the bill, should extend only to the counties for that purpose named in the bill, and not to other‘maritime counties, especially such as ate most infamous for running goods; where, though the vessels described may not as yet be so much in use as in the counties maned, yet wHt undoubtedly be more used in other

counties not named; when thfey can ho longer be kept in the counties or places the bill extends to; and, we conceive, laws should not make a distinction where there is no difference in reason, on a dependance that it may be Supplied by a new law another opportunity.

«*6. Because the time allowed by the bdl (viz. to the 25th of this instant March) either to dispose of the barges and other prohibited vessels, or obtain licences for the keeping, is much too short, as we conceive, and will prove the occasion of more hardships being done than

can possibly be foreseen.---- Scars-

A New Standing Order concerning the entering Protests.] March 3. The Lords, according to order, proceeded to take into consideration the inotion for making the Order, That such Lords as shall enter their Protestations with Reasons, shall do the same before two o’clock the next sitting day, and sign them before the House rises, a Standing Order of the House, and that the same be entered on the roll of Standing Orders, instead of the Order of the%th of March, 1641.

Protest against it.] And the said Order being read, after debate, the question was put thereupon, and resolved in the affirmative.

, “ Dissentient ’

1. ‘ For that the Standing Order, in relation to the time of entering Protestations, was made above 80 years since, and was restrictive of an ancient right; and yet in all that time, till now, has never been thought not to have restrained that right enough; but on the con* trary, whenever longer time, than is allowed by that Order, has been asked, as it has been done in innumerable instances, it was never once ^denied, as we believe; which shews that the constant opinion of this House has hitherto been, that the restraint brought upon that ancient right of the Lords, by that old Order, has been rather too much than too little.

2. “ The abridging this right of protesting With reasons yet mote, will necessarily cause the reasons to be penned with less accuracy, and probably longer than they would have been, had more, time been allowed; which, though it may gratify those who differ in opinion from the protesters, yet will hurt the honour of the House, as we conceive, and the dignity of the records thereof; for we can by no mfeans allow, that as much time should not be afforded toword the Lords' Reasons, which are to be entered on the Journals, a9 would bo necessary to the wording of a pamphlet designed to be pnoted and published. '

3. “ Because we* conceive, that if this farther restraint does not render (he protesting quite impracticable, yet it most prove very in?

$Tf] PAUL. HI$TORY, 8 G bo roe L \10, 2. — Protest respecting the tyebt. [978

commodious and troublesome to the Lords yrho would make use of that their undoubted right; for if a debate should take up any long time, as most debates of consequence should dpf the intermediate time allowed is, in our opinion, not sufficient for. Lords, who design to protest, to meet and bring their several reasons together, and afterwards express them with that clearness, and so unexceptionably as they ought to do; and besides, get them fairly and correctly entered upon the Journal: So that, in our opinion, they must very often be either excluded from entering and signing their Reasons, or endure a great deal of hardship and inconvenience, by denying themselves the usual rest and refreshments (as is very obvious without farther explanation) and be obliged to come long before their ordinary duty of attending the business of the House requires; so that, we conceive, this new restraint will either hinder protesting with Reasons, or amount to a kind of punishment on those Lords, who shall make use of their ancient' and undoubted right of protesting.

4. “ There seems to us the less reason for this step, - because if the liberty of entering Protestations with Reasons be in any degree abused, the House can, and does, order them, «r such parts of them, as can be reasonably objected to, to be expunged; and this observation is yet stronger, for that of late precedents have been made of expunging a great number of Reasons, and of a various nature, by one general question; which is a very expeditious remedy for any abuse that can happen.

5. “ If ever there should be a time, when the utmost candour and fairness is less in use than at present, this new restriction pn the right of protesting with Reasons, may open a gap to many artifices anti unfair practices in prejudice of that right; clerk* may come later than usual, pretend. other business, or write slower, or use other shifts to avoid perfecting the eutry of the Reasons till after the time allowed, especially if they shall think, though falsely, they gratify a majority of the House by to doing, which will make them at least hope ior impunity; or if not so disposed, they! may be, on the other hand, induced (and not unreasonably) to write faster and more loosely than will become the Journal of this House, that the entry may be finished within the time limited. We do not pretend to enumerate all the ways of making this alteration of the old Standing Order more inconvenient than appears at first tight, but only specify these few.

6. “ We Qo pot think the right of entering Protestations with Reasons has been of late itbused, so as to give occasion for this new restriction, though it may have been used of late more frequently than formerly; for which, according to our opinions, .there bath been very proper occasions given; and since we cannot but think the right of protesting with reasons a valuable and useful privilege, we must confess pur fears, lest these restrictions, though not fpw intended so. should end at length in a total

voi.vn.

extinction of that right.----(Signed,) W.

Debt.] Then the Order was read for taking into consideration, the Protests entered on the Journal of this House, on the 19th and 20th days of February last, and the several Reasons in the Protest entered the 19th of February last, against putting off the farther considerations of the causes of contracting so large a Navy Debt, for three weeks, being read, it was proposed, “ That from the word [specified] in the tenth line of the fourth Reason, to the eod of the said Protest, [see p. 970] be expunged.” And it being moved to adjourn, the question was put, Whether this House shall be now adjourned till Monday morning next ? it was resolved in the negative.

Then the question was put, Whether all that is contained in the said Protest after the Word specified’ in the tenth line of the fourth Reason, shall be expunged 7 It was resolved in the affirmative, by 45 against 18.

“ Dissentient ’

“ Because when we were giving reasons against putting off the farther consideration of the causes of the Navy-Debt by long adjournments, probably for the whole session, as we thought no reason could be more proper than that the subject-matter of that inquiry was not exhausted, but that very much material business remained to be considered on that bead; so we did, and do yet conceive, that the following that general assertion, with an enumeration of the particular matters which yet did remain to be inquired into, as well such as arose from papers already before the House, as others which, we were well assured would arise in the farther progress of that business (from papers designed to be called for) did make the said general argument, which stands ex ponged, more strong, as well as more fair and candid, by shewing it was well founded upon particulars; and although the House has not thought fit to permit the said enumeration of particulars to stand on the Journal, yet, we conceive, we have attained this advantage", by having entered them, that it cannot be objected to us now, that we generally affirmed more business of consequence remained tor that committee to do, without being able to instance or specify what in particular.----(Signed) W.

Protest against expunging the Protest of th* 20 th of Feb. relating to the National-Debt.] Then the Reason for the Protest entered the 20th of Feb. last, on consideration of the State of the National Debt, being reed, after SR

970] PAUL. HISTORY, 8 George I. \VZ2. — Thc Speaker’s Speech to the King. [980

Debate the question was put, whether the entire Reason for the said Protest shall be expunged f It was resolved in the affirmative.

“ Dissentient ’

Because, we conceive, there is no instance of expunging the Reasons of a Protest, unless they were thought to contain something indecent to the House, or atledged matters of fact that were false; the first is not presumed in this present case: and as to the second, the matter depending upon figures, there can be no dispute, but upon the method of calculation; and if the Lords who signed the Protest did choose to follow the method observed by the officers of the Exchequer, rather than any other, we do not conceive their Reasons, founded on such authority, deserved to be expunged; neither do* we think the said Lords were obliged to raakje deductions from the Exchequer account, which was laid before the House, without making the proper additions at the same time; for it must be agreed, that if the Debt stated in 1717, was but 47, 800,000l.; and in the year 1720, above fifty millions, the bringing the annuities into the South-Sea Company may occasion an increase of about two millions and a half; and the Army'Debentures not yet brought to account, are estimated at about half a million more; and the Debt of the Navy is near two millions ; 'so the whole appears to be about fifty-five millions, and the increase of the National Debt (since it was stated in 1717) might therefore be reckoned about seven millions; and deducting the million of Exche>-quer-Bills lent to the South-Sea Company, the real increase of the National Debt, above what it was stated at in the year 1717, appears to us, at this time, about six millions:but as the Reasons were founded on the account laid before the House, which kept in the million of Exchequer-Bills as a Debt, and excluded all the other articles, *ye conceive they ought not to have been expunged, since the under-reckoning the Debt was not the objection made against them. — — f Signed)Fran.

Protest against expunging the Protest of the 17th Jan. against the Qu*Bill.~\ March

5. The Order was read for taking into consideration the Protest entered in the Journal of the 17th of Jan. [See p. 946.1 on rejecting the Petition from the London Clergy against the Quakers’ Bill; and the several Reasons for the said Protest being read, after debate, the question being put, that the entire Entry of the Reasons, for the said Protest, be expunged; it was resolved in the affirmative, by 54 voices against 18.

“ Dissentient ’

uBecause firmer Reasons entered against some late Resolutions for expunging do, as we conceive, equally extend to justify our dissent

to this Resolution; and therefore, to avoid repetition we refer to those Reasons, with this farther, That we do not find, ' and believe there is not any precedent, wherein Reasons for a Protestation have been taken into consideration by the House so long after they were entered, as in the present case; and the inconveniencies of doing so are, in our opinion, very-

manifest.----(Signed,) Strafford, F. Roffen’,

The Speaker's Speech to the King on presenting the Money Bi//.l March 7. The King went to the House of Peers with the usual state and solemnity, and the Commons attending, their Speaker, upon presenting the Money-Bill, made the following Speech to his Majesty, viz.

“ Most gracious Sovereign;

“ This is the seventh year in which yoar majesty’s faithful Commons, without burthening your people with any new or unusual taxes, have readily and cheerfully granted to your majesty the necessary Supplies, not only for carrying on the ordinary expences of the government, but for maintaining the honour and dignity of the crown; and, at the same time, they have omitted no opportunity of easing the public incumbrances, and of putting the. National Debt into a method of payment; for no soouer had your majesty, by the vigilance of your councils, and the success of your arms, restored and secured the public peace and tranquillity, but your Commons immediately found means to reduce the Interest of the National Debt, and thereby set apart a Fund, rfhich, by a farther reduction of interest since made by your Commons, will, in a few years, -be considerably increased, and the payment of the principal become practicable; and from which your majesty’s trading subjects have already reaped this immediate benefit, that your Commons have been enabled, during this session, without endangering the security of any parliamentary engagements, to take off such duties as were found by experience to be most prejudicial to the trade and manufactures of your kingdoms. Arid as your- Commons were apprehensive, that the Debt of the Navy was rising to such an height, as would, if not timely prevented, necessarily affect and depreciate all other public credit, and which would inevitably increase the charge and expence of the current service; they have therefore unanimously agreed on such methods of discharging so much of that Debt, a9 will effectually reveut the mischiefs they apprehend, and can e no ways burthensome to their fellow-subjects.

* Thus have your Commons fully and happily completed every thing which your majesty was graciously pleased to recommend to them at the beginning of this session; and whenever your majesty, in your royal wisdom, shall again

981] PAUL HIST. S Georg* 1.1722. — King's Speech Close of the Session.[9S3

think it proper to meet your people in parliament, may they imitate your present House of Commpns in our duty and affection to your majesty, id our steadiness and resolution to support your government; may they continue, with like application and diligence, to extend trade and commerce, the true and natural source of wealth and plenty in these kingdoms; and we should think ourselves happy, if even our mistakes might be of service to your majesty, by being a warning to those that come •fter us:and that when the wisdom of your majesty’s councils, and the steadiness of your administration, shall have restored credit to its former flourishing condition, they maynotgrow wanton with too much prosperity, but may proceed with such caution and prudence in their endeavours to lessen the National Debt; as may put it out of the power of any set of men to produce misery and distress, from what shall be proposed for the. ease and benefit of your people; and that, by the blessing and assistance of Divine Providence, they may so effectually unite the affections of your people, and . firmly establish your majesty’s throne,

* That the Scepter may not depart from your

* Royal House, nor a Lawgiver from between

* your Feet!’ That the ancient legal constitution of this- kingdom, in King, Lords and Commons, may be perpetuated in your majesty and your Royal Posterity, till time shall W.no more.

“ Your majesty having been, at different times, in the coarse of this session, graciously pleased to accept such Supplies, as your Commons offered to your majesty for the Service of this year, they do now humbly pray your majesty’s like gracious acceptance of a Bill they have prepared for discharging the Debt of the Navy, ip titled, ‘ An Act for paying off and < cancelling one Million of Exchequer Bills, See. ”

The King's Speech at the Close of the Seventh end last Session of the Fifth Parliament of Great Britain."] After this, the King gave the royal assent to several public and private Bills. Then the Lord Chancellor, by his majesty’s command, delivered the following Speech to both Houses:

“ My Lords and Gentlemen;

. u You could not have given me a more acceptable instance of your zeal and affection, than by dispatching, with so much unanimity, the several particulars I recommended to you at the beginning of this session, for the ease and advantage of m^ people.

“ The many and great encouragements you have given to our trade and manufactures, and the provision you have made for our being supplied with naval stores from our own plantations, will, I make no doubt, excite the industry of my subjects, employ a greater n limber of the poor, increase our navigation, and be a considerable addition to the riches and strength of this nation.

“ Gentlemen of the House of Commons; The raising the current Supplies of the

year, and the making a provision for the discharge of so considerable a'part of the Debt of the Navy, is a farther proof of your affection to me, and your regard for the public; and doing it in a manner so little burthensome to my people gives me the greatest satisfaction. u My Lords and Gentlemen;

" I cannot in justice part with this parliament, without returning you my sincerest thanks, for your steady and resolute adherence to my1 person and government, and to the interest of the Protestant Cause, both at home and abroad. The enemies of our happy constitution have given the strongest and most honourable testimony of your behaviour in these particulars, by the implacable malice which they have, upon all occasions, expressed against you.

“ Vou must all be sensible, that they are, at this juncture reviving, with the greatest industry, the same wicked arts of calumny and defamation, which have been the constant preludes to public troubles and disorders; and such is their infatuation, that they Batter themselves the grossest misrepresentations will turur to their advantage, and give them an opportunity of recommending themselves to the favour and good opinion of my people; but I have sojust a confidence in the affection of my subjects, and in their regard for their own welfare, that I am persuaded they will not suffer themselves to be thus imposed upon, and betrayed into their own destruction.

“ For my part, as the preservation of the constitution in church and state shall always be my care, I am firmly determined to continue to countenance such as have manifested theif zeal for the present establishment, and have the religious and civil rights of all my subjects truly at heart; and I question not but that behaviour, which has justly recommended them to me, will effectually secure to them the # good will of all that are well affected to my ‘ government; and will convince the world, that the expectations of those are very ill grounded, who hope to prevail with a Protestant free people, to give up their religion and liberties into the hands of such as are enemies to both."

The Parliament dissolved.] And then the Lord Chancellor, by his majesty’s command, prorogued the Parliament to the 15th of March 1722, but on the 10th of the same month a Proclamation was issued for the Dissolution of this Parliament, and the Calling another.

Sarliaraent, died Charles Spencer, earl of Sunderland, whose abilities as a minister were indisputable, but who - exposed himself to great odium by the violence of his temper, and the share he was thought to have had in the South-Sea scheme; and in the latter part of his life it is thought, upon good grounds, that he had entered into correspondencies and designs, which would have been fatal to himself, or to the public. — His death was followed in less than a month by that of his father in law the duke of Marlborough. He was interred the 9th *of August, with* great funeral pomp, in Westminster Abbey; and was succeeded as master-general of the ordnance, and colonel of the first regiment of foot, by the earl of Cadogan. — The elections for members of parliament were carried on with great zeal on both sides, but the majority of the elected, was clearly in favour of the court; as was likewise that of the sixteen Scots peers.

It was king George’s lot to meet with continual disturbances. The affair of the South-Sea, and the favour shown to the managers of that scheme, bad raised great discontents. It v«as natural for the enemies of -his person and government to improve such a juncture. Accordingly they did so; and, though without hope of any foreign assistance, they imagined it possible to succeed in their designs, unless prevented by a discovery. The king had some suspicion of a Plot, which be had intimated in his speech to both Houses, but, presently after, his suspicions were turned into certainty. In the beginning of May he had full information of a conspiracy formed against him, the first notice of which came from the duke of Orleans.

Upon this information, a camp was marked out in Hyde-park, to which the troops of the king’s houshold marched the next day. Orders Were issued to all military officers immediately to repair to their respective commands. Lieutenant general Maccartney was dispatched to Ireland, to bring over some troops from (thence into the west of England. Messengers were sent to Scotland to secure some suspected persons; and Mr. Horace Walpole, who some days before went over to Holland, was instructed to desire the States, to keep in readiness the guarantee troops, in order to be sent into England in case of necessity. On the other hand, colonel Churchill was sent to the court of France, with a private commission, probably to see how far the assurances from thence were to he depended upon. By these precautions the public tranquillity. was preserved in Great-Britain. However the apprehensions of the Plot did not a little affect public credit; for, on May the 7th, South-Sea stock fell from 90 to 77; and the timorous or disaffected began to run upon the Bank. But, a few days after, the funds gradually rose to their former value.

To authorise these precautions, and sound the- temper of the people, the lord Townshend writ the following letter to the lord-mayor of London.

I. li2f*~Primeipid Occv[984

. My Lord; . Whitehall, May 8, 1793.

* His majesty having nothing more at heart

* than the peace and safety of his good city of ‘ London, the protection of its inhabitants,

‘ and the support of public credit, has com-

* manded me to acquaint your lordship, that he ‘ has received repeated and unquestionable ad-

* vices, that several of his subjects, forgetting ‘ the allegiance they owe to his majesty, as well ‘ as the natural love they ought to bear to

* their country, have entered into a wicked Con *

‘ spiracy, in conoart with traitors abroad, for

* raising a rebellion in this kingdom m favour

* of a Popish Pretender, with, a traiterous de-‘ sign to overthrow our excellent constitution

* both in chuTch and state, and to subject

* Protestant free people to tyranny and soper-

* stition; but I am persuaded, that it will be a ‘ great satisfaction to your lordship and the ‘ city, to find, that, at the same time lam on ‘ dered to inform yon of this design; I am

* likewise commanded by his majesty to let yon ‘ know, that he is firmly assured that the an *

* thors of it neither are, nor will be supported,

‘ nor even countenanced by any foreign power *

‘ And as his majesty has bad timely notice of

* their wicked machinations, and has made the ‘ proper'dispositions for defeating them, be has

* no reason to doubt, but by the continuance'of

* the blessing of Almighty God, and the ready ‘ assistance, of his faithful subjects, this effort

* of the malice of his enemies will be turned tm

* their own confusion.

* His majesty makes no doubt, but your *

‘ lordship, pursuant fo the trust reposed in yoa,

‘ will, in conjunction with the other magistrates ‘ of his good city of London, exert, with the

* utmost care and vigilance, your authority at

* so important a conjuncture, for the preeer *

* ration of the public peace, and the security

< of the city. I am, &c. Townsusnd. ’

The reception this letter met with was very acceptable to the court. An Address was presented by the court of aldermen, thanking the king for his indulgent regard to the city of London, by informing them of the wicked designs of his enemies both at home and abroad, and congratulating him upon the happy success of his negotiations, which had procured assurances, that these traiterous purposes would not be supported by any foreign power.

< When we reflect (continues the Address)or ‘ the many blessings, which Britons enjoy,

‘ under the protection of a prince, who makes ‘ the laws of this land his rule for the govern *

‘ ment of his people, when we consider that neither the civil, or religious rights of your.

* in the highest degree, against their king, and-‘the laws of their country, we oannot but ex-‘ press the utmost abhorrence of those vile and

The example of London was followed by many other cities and botoughs, who all expressed the same zeal and devotion. But, notwithstanding these assurances, the king’s journey to Hanover was laid aside, though the regency had been settled, in which the prince of Wales had no part. The court, however, went to Kensington, and the prince and princess retired to Richmond.

Various were the reports about the nature, and discovery of the conspiracy, as the government did not as yet think fit to publish the particulars. However, to remove all suspicion of its reality, several persons were taken up. On the 21st of May, Mr. George Kelly, who went under the name of Johnson, an Irish clergyman, was seized at his lodgings in Bury-Street, by three messengers, for treasonable correspondencies; and, having delivered his sword and papers to them-, they placed them in a window, and went in search of other things. Their negligence gave him an opportunity of recovering his sword, which he drew, and swore he would run the first man through the body, that disturbed him in what he was doing, which was burning his papers in a candle with his left hand, whilst he held the drawn sword in the other. When the papers were burnt, he surrendered himself.

On the 4th of August, Mr, Robert Cotton, of Huntingdonshire, one of the gentlemen concerned in the late rebellion, and cleared by the act of grace, was seized at his lodgings over against Somerset house, as were also his footman and landlady. Two days after, Mr. Cochran and Mr. Smith were brought prisoners from Edinburgh, and Cochran was committed to the Tower. One John Sample, formerly a fesvant to sir Robert Sutton, while he resided as envoy extraordinary at the court of France* having been taken up for high-treason, and being in custody of a messenger, found means,

on the 5th of August, to make his escape, upon which a proclamation was issued out, with a reward of l,000i. for apprehending him. And, on the 13th, another proclamation, with the like reward, was published for apprehending Mr. Thomas Carte, a nonjuring clergyman, against whom a warrant bad been issued by one of the secretaries of state.

u On the 24th of August, Dr. Francis Atter-bnry, bishop of Rochester, and dean of Westminster, was apprehended by some of the king’s messengers, who, having searched his house, and secured some of his papers, carried him before a committee of the privy-council, who, having examined him, committed him to the Tower for high-treason. The next day Mr. Thomas Moore, vicarofSt. Botolph Aldersgate, formerly secretary to the bishop of Rochester, was likewise taken up, and afterwards examined, but soon after discharged.

About the middle of September, Bingley, Mr. Neynoe, a young Irish priest, and two other persons, were seized at Deal, and brought up prisoners to London. About the same time Mr. Layer, a young counsellor of the Temple, being also apprehended, he endeavoured, the next day, to make his escape, and succeeded so far in his design, that he found means to get out at a back-window two story high, and, having reached the river side, be gave a sculler some guineas to carry him over the water to Southwark with all possible expedition. But being discovered, upon his going off, by a servant maid, he was immediately pursued, and* a hue-and-cry being raised -after him, he was taken and brought back, and the next morning committed to the Tower. On the 21st of.September, he was brougty under a strong guard to the Cock-pit at Whitehall, and, having been some hours under examination, before a committee of the privy-council, was remanded to his confinement. The day before, Mr. Sayer* of the Temple, was taken into custody; as was also, the next day, Mr. Stewart, clerk to Mr. Layer, while his master was under examination. The same day, John Plunket, serjeant to a Company of invalids at Plymouth, was seized at Chelsea, upon suspicion of being concerned with Mr. Layer, and, after examination, com- mitted to the custody of a messenger. On the 24th, Mr. Shippen’s house in Norfolk-street was searched for papers, that might give light into some suspicions. Warrants were likewise issued out for apprehending the lord North and Grey, who was gone as far as the Isle of Wight* and had put himself on board a smuggler’s sloop* having been some time at Mr. Holmes’s bouse in chat island. Colonel Morgan, the deputy governor, being informed of his being on board the sloop, sent a captain of one of the king’* frigates, to have an eye upon the sloop, and* when going to sail, to send his long-boat aboard, and secure all the passengers on suspicion; which being done, the lord North and Grey at first pretended to be another person; but, finding that did him no service, he confessed who he was; and he and the rest of the passengers S

were carried before the governor, who told them, \ he must secure them tilThe could write to court; and, upon an ‘answer from thence, he had orders %osend them up in custody. The lord North and Grey's house, in Great Queen-street, being also searched for papers, the messenger found there Mr. Swathfegger, secretary to the earl of Orrery, who was seized and committed to custody; and the next morning, September 27, the earl himself was, brought to town from his seat at Brittel in Buckinghamshire, and haying been examined at the Cock-pit, was ordered to be confined that night at his own house in Glass-House-Street, under a guard of thirty soldiers; and the next day, in the evening, was again examined by a committee of the privy-council, and committed to the Tower; as was also the lord North and Grey, being brought up from Portsmouth by lieutenant general Mac-cartney, colonel Gordon, and a messenger.

On the 16th of September Mr. Fleetwood was taken into custody, and Mrs. Layer, ignorant of her husband's fate and coming over from France, was about the same time seized at Dover.

Two days after, Mr. Stephen Neynoe, the Irish priest, seized at Deal, being closely confined in the house of Mr. Crawford, one of the king's messengers, in Manchester-court near the Thames, found means about three in the morning, to make his escape from a window two story high, by tying the blankets and sheets together, and got to the wall of a neighbouring garden adjoining to the river; but not knowing that the tide was high, he leaped into the water, and being unskilled in swimming was drowned.

After the bishop of Rochester had lain a fortnight in prison, sir Constantine Phipps presented a petition to the court at the sessions house in the Old Bailey, in the name of Mrs.

Morris, the bishop's daughter, praying that, m consideration of the bishop's ill state of health* he might be either brought to a speedy trial, or-bailed or discharged:but it was overruled, as were also the petitions of two other prisoners for the plot, Cochran and Dennis Kelly.

The commitment of the bishop of Rochester made a great noise through the whole kingdom, and gave occasion to the disaffected' to heighten jealousies and discontents. They pretended his confinement was injurious to the church of England, and the episcopal order, and went so far as. to offer up public prayers-for him (under pretence of his, being afflicted with the gout) in most churches and chapels in London and Westminster, on Sunday the 16th of September. On the other hand, endeavours were used to remove the prejudices of the clergy against the ministry, and Dr. Gibson, bishop of Lincoln (now of London) wrote a circular letter, wherein he sets forth the indulgence wherewith the bishop was treated:the great respect the order of bishops met with from the king, who iivthe disposal of his preferments was directed by their advice: the improbability of so unpopular an act, without a just and even necessary foundation:and lastly, the safety of the nation, which requires that all delinquents should be censured as such without any regard to the office, or title, or honour they bear.

The noise made by the Conspiracy seemed to require the Meeting of the New Parliament as soon as the season would permit. Accordingly on the 9th of October, the king came to the House of Peers and opened the Session with a speech to both Houses. But with the proceedings of the New Parliament we shall commence our next Volume.

A Report from the Committee of Secrecy, appointed by Order of the House of Commons to examine several Books and Papers laid before the House, relating to the late Negocia-(tions' of. Peace and Commerce, &c. Reported on the 9th of June, 1715, by the. Right Hon. Robert Walpole, esq. Chairman of the said Committee. Together with an Appendix, containing Memorials, Letters, and other Papers referred to in the said Report. *

THE Committee of Secrecy appointed to examine the several Books and Papers to them referred, and to report to the House what they should find material in them, having examined and considered the same, have agreed upon the following Report to be made to the House, containing such facts and papers as appeared to them to be most material, and of the highest importance, together with the reasons that induced the committee to lay them Before the House for their further consideration.

The several Books and Papers referred to the committee chiefly relate to the late negotiations of peace and commerce; To the intended demolition of Dunkirk; To the obtaining and disposing of the Assiento contract; To some negotiations concerning the Catalans; and secret transactions relating to the Pretender.

The Committee was in hopes, in so voluminous an enquiry, to have been able to trace out all the steps, and the whole progress, of these negotiations; but, to their surprize, they find a want of several books, letters, and papers, mentioned and referred to in those that have been delivered to them, and frequent and long interruptions of some very material correspondences that were carried on:But being informed, that these accounts are all, which have any way come to the hands of those who have the honour to serve his present majesty, the committee proceeded to draw up the following Report, warranted and founded upon such authorities, as the persons concerned vouchsafed not to suppress.

* See the Proceeding of the House of Commons, June 9, 1715.

Vol. VII.

The first material paper is entituled “ The first Propositions of France, ” signed by M. de Torcy, April the 22(1, 1711, N. S, and is here annexed. N° 1. To whom these Propositions were directed, what previous steps had been made on the part of France, or what encou-, ragement haa been given on the part of England; does not appear; but it is evident that they are conceived in very loose and general terms; -that from the beginning the design of France Was to secure Spain and the West Indies to king Philip; to create jealousies among the allies; and that France offered to treat with England and Holland, either by themselves, or Jointly with’ the rest of the allies, which is left to the choice of England.

' On the 27th of April, 1711. Q. S. Mr. Secretary St. John transmits these propositions to lord Raby, the queen’s Ambassador at the Hague, with orders to communicate them to the Pensiofiary, u to assure that minister the queen was resolved in making peace, as iu making war, tp act in perfect concert with the States, and desires the secret may be kept among as few, as possible; he confesses that the terms, of the several propositions are very general, that there is an air of complaisance shewn to England, and the contrary to Holland, which might he of ill consequence, but can be of none, as long as the Queen and States, take care to understand each other, and to act with as little reserve as becomes two powers so nearly allied in interest; and desires the Pensionary to be assured, that this rule shall on our part be inviolably observed.”

Lord Raby by his letters of May the 25 and 26th, 1711, N. S. to Mr. St. John, in answer to these orders and assurances, acquaints him. (A)

That the Pensionary had, with those of that state who had been formerly employed in the negotiations of peace, considered M. de Torcy’s propositions, and the obliging manner in which her majesty was pleased to communicate them; that they thanked her majesty for her confidence in them, and assure her, that theirs is reciprocal; and that as her majesty had promised, she will make no step towards a peace but in concert with them, they desire she may be assured of the same on their part; and that they will make no step in that, or any other kind of negotiation, which regards the mutual interests of both nations, but iu communication and concert with her majesty; they urge the necessity of an entire confidence one with the other, at this critical juncture; they declare themselves weary of the war, which they endeavour to conceal from the enemy, least he should make his advantage by it; and that they are ready to join in any measures, which her majesty shall think proper to obtain a good peace. -But they look upon these propositions as yet, in the same manner as the secretary does, to be very dark and-general, and designed to create jealousies between her majesty, that republic, and the allies: but they depend upon her majesty’s justice and prudence, to prevent any such ill effect, and hope she will make the French explain, more particularly, the several points contained in them/ ’

After these mutual assurances had passed betwixt England and Holland/ the committee is surprized to find not the least communication to the States of the negotiations that were carrying on, for above five months together, betwixt England and France, till after the special preliminaries were signed, and the seven general preliminaries were concluded and sent to them.

In the mean time lord Raby, not being as yet let into the secret, freely declares, he thought it adviseable, and necessary, to go open with the States in this'matter of the propositions; acquaints the secretary that all the letters from France agreed, that all the hopes the French had was to sow jealousies among the allies. And repeats his advice, That we must act cautiously with them (the States) that they may have no reason to accuse us, for taking the'least measures without them.

But it was not long before, Mr. Secretary St. John prepared his excellency to have other sentiments of the manner of Carrying on this negotiation, and in 'his letter of the 29th of May acquaints him with the agreeable news,

That it was her majesty’s pleasure, that his Excellency should make all possible haste t6 come over, since her service may better dispense with his absence at this 'point of time, than it will perhaps do at another, and since we must now expect to have very soon upon the tapis, many intrigues, concerning which, the aueen thinks it expedient that he should confer with the ministers here ;" acquaints him, that her majesty designed, upon his arrival, to give him the promotion in the

peerage, which he bad desired. And then, that his excellency might begin to have some notions agreeable to the -ssuse of Cur ministers, Mr. St. John in answer to some very long letters of his lordship’s full of his own reasonings, and the repeated assurances of the ministers of the States to act in perfect concert and with an entire confidence in her majesty, tells him in these words, “ That Britain had gone' so much too far in weaving her interest into that of the continent, that it would prove no easy task to disentangle our affairs without tearing or rending."

But this work of tearing and rending did not at all discourage his excellency, who waiting then for several posts from England, stopped by contrary winds, and beginning to suspect that the course of the1 negotiation was turned into another channel, that the ministry here might be satisfied that his lordship could without much difficulty depart from his own opinion, he declares in his letter of June the 16th, 1711, N. S. to Mr. St.John; “ You may be assured, I will venture any thing, and undertake any thing, to serve the queen; you may venture boldly tb trust me with the real intentions, and be assured, I will not make further use of them, than according to nay instructions. He tells him, if the-thing is actually gone no further than it appears, and France has not yet explained, and he has a mind, that he should cqine over for the queen’s service, “ he is ready to come in a yacht, frigate, packet-boat, or any way; ” and concludes, “ in short, dispose of me how you please, for all my desire is to serve her majesty to her satisfaction, and I shall never grudge any danger and pains’."

This voluntary and frank declaration his excellency desires in a particular manner, may with his humble compliments be communicated to the duke of Shrewsbury and Mr. Harley.

It has been already observed, that all correspondence betwixt England and Holland, concerning the present treaty, ended with the communication of the first propositions of France; if the Dutch had made any attempts to wrest the negotiation out of the bands of the queen, if they had entered into any separate measures, or taken any steps that might give jnst occasion of offence or suspicion to England, it is very probable the accounts, of any such proceedings would have been left by the ministry, for their own justification; but the committee does not find the least intimation of this kind, and are at a loss to know upon what pretence such solemn assurances were dispensed with as soon as made, and the honour and name of the queen sacrificed to the private views of her ministers.

All transactions betwixt England and France during this time, except two or three papers, are entirely suppressed, which in lord Strafford's instructions of October the 1st, 1711, are said to have been carried on by papers sent backward and forward, and much time spent therein; the first paper, that is found, is ceiled, “ Private Propositions sent by Mr. Prior fronts England" dated July 1st. No. 2.

Ti

APPENDIX. — Negotiations for Peace: 1715. [yi

The next is a paper called, Mr. Prior’s Authority; this is signed, Anne R. at tho top, and A. R. at the bottom, not countersigned, and is without a date, and the contents are, M Mr. Prior is fully instructed and authorized to communicate to France our preliminary demands, and to bring us back the answer.”

These two papers together must be understood to he Mr. Prior’s powers and instructions, or are at least all that are found in the office, or given in by him; but by an entry in lord Strafford's book subjoined to these private propositions carried over by Mr. Prior, it appears that Mr. Prior had orders to see if France had full powers from Spain.

These propositions, which were formed here, leave no room to doubt of the little concern (be ministry had to make good the repeated assurances, that had beeu given to the allies, in the queen’s name, to make the French more plain and particular, since in all things that concern the allies, the English proposals are as dark and general, as those that came from France.; and if this still could be any question, it is sufficiently cleared up in a third paper, intituled, “ Draught of Answers upon the conference with M. Mesnager, ” wherein the British ministry is much surprised to find That M. Mesnager had orders to insist that the queen should enter into particular engagements upon divers articles which depend not upon her, and which regard the interest of the allies; they appeal to all the papers which had been sent backward and forward during this negotiation, and to that which was carried by Mr. Prior, that the principle upon which they had treaded all along was, that France should consent to adjust the interests of Great Britain in the first place. This is a principle from* which the queen cap never depart, and that it was absolutely necessary to remit the discussion of the particular interests of the allies to general conferences.

By this it appears, that the minister of France was instructed to treat of the interests of the allies, which the English ministry would by no means consent to.

By M. Torcy’s Proposals, France offered to treat with England and Holland, either by themselves, or jointly with the rest of the allies, not conceiving that Holland could possibly be excluded from the negotiation; but it is determined by the English ministry to carry on a separate negotiation with France, exclusive of all the allies, and in their private propositions, an express article is inserted, “ That (he secret should be inviolably kept, till allowed to be divulged by the consent of both parties; ” and thereby England put the negotiation into a method more advantageous for France, than France had proposed or could hops for.

The Committee think it proper to insert here the first part of the Eighth article of the grand alliance, wherein it is stipulated, 4 Neutri par-‘tiumfas sit, Bello semel suscepto, de Pace *cam Hofcte tractare, nisi conjunction, et com-

4 municatis Consiliis cum altera Parte.’ What will be thought of so manifest a violation, aa this whole proceeding appears to be, of the grand alliance, the committee will not take upon them to determine; but this step being once taken, and secret preliminaries signed upon this foot between England and Frauce, before anything had been finally treated and concluded for the eecurity of Great Britain, what fatal consequences did happen to her majesty’s kingdoms, and what advantages accrued to the common enemy, seems to deserve the most mature consideration.

Before we leave these Propositions it must be observed, that here, in the very infancy of the negotiation, the trade of the world, and the entire Spanish monarchy, which bad cost so many millions, and the effusion of so much blood, without being once insisted upon, contrary to the repeated addresses of several parliaments, and the declared sense of the queen, are given up by the English ministry to the house of Bourbon, for verbal assurances that the crowns of France and Spain, shall never be united:and that this was done so early, will be necessary to be remembered in the further progress of these transactions.

There is no account given of any correspondence with Mr. Prior during this his stay in France, nor does the certain time of his. continuance there appear. Upon his arrival at France, M. de Torcy in his letter of the 3d of August, ' 1711, N. S. tells Mr. St.John “he saw with great pleasure Mr. Prior return after an interval of so many years; that he' could have wished he had had greater liberty to employ those talents, which he was persuaded he Would have made a good use of; but he hopes M. Mesnager will supply what he could not do.’’ Upon his return he was attended by M. Mesnager, a minister of France, vested with full powers in due form, (and dated August the 3d, 1711, to treat, negotiate, conclude, and sign, with such ministers, as should be authorized in due form, not by Britain only, but .any of the princes or estates then in actual war with France.

That M. Mesnager, upon his arrival here, frequently conferred with the queen’s ministers, appears by many instances; but the subject matter of these conferences, the times, places, and particular persons with whom he treated, or by what authority, the committee find no account of, till the 20th of September, 1711.

By a letter of Mr. Secretary St. John, then at London, of that date, to the 'queen at Windsor, No. 3, it appears, ' that the lord treasurer, lord chamberlain, lord Dartmouth, and Mr. St. John, met M. Mesnager that evening at Mr. Prior’s bouse; which meeting, as Mr, St. John says, was by order of the lords of the committee of council, but seems unknown to the queen, until the secretary acquainted her With it by this letter.

At this meeting M. Mesnager delivered to the British ministers the Answer, signed by the king of France, to the Demands last 6ent over

viij APPENDIX.^-Jfcporf relating to the [viif

by England: which Demands and Answers were made the'’ secret preliminary articles betwixt Great Britain and France, and were signed as such. Sept. 27th, 1711, by Mes-nager on the part of France, and the accepta- tion of thetn by lord Dartmouth, and Mr. St. John, on the part of Great Britain. No. 4.

Mr. St. John, in this Letter, represents it to the queen, as the unanimous opinion of her servants, then present, that a warrant and full powers should be prepared that night and transmitted to her majesty to be signed, m order to pass the great seal the next day, whereby the earl of Oxford, the Duke of Buckinghamshire, die bishop of Bristol, the duke of Shrewsbury, earl Powlet, earl of Dartmouth, Henry St. John aod"MattHew Prior, esqri; were to be constituted plenipotentiaries; to meet and treat with M. Mesnager, which warrant, and a translation of the full powers, were sent to the queen. No. 5.

This Warrant under the signet appears sign-by the queen, directing the lord keeper to affix the great seal to an instrument thereunto annexed, containing her commission to himself, and others, therein named, to meet and treat with the Sieur Mesnager; but it does not appear that any such instrument did pass the great seal, the warrant remains not countersigned, and is endorsecT Not used/

This Warrant is dated the 17.th of Sept, although it is manifest, by Mr. St. John's letter, it was not prepared, nor thought of, till the 20th.

This antedating seems designed to justify the ministers, in their meeting and conferring with the queen’s enemies, previous to the warrant; which never passing into a legal authority, it appears that these secret negotiations betwixt France and the queen’s ministers here, were begun and carried on from the 11th of April to the 25th Sept. 1711, when the warrant to lord Dartmouth and Mr. St. John was signed, without any powers or written authority from the queen; and it is very observable, that the queen was brought into these measures, by its being represented to her by the secretary of state as the unanimous opinion of all her ministers, to which alone the assent of the queen is to be ascribed.

But what is mpre strange, is, that after Mr. St. John had represented it to the queen, as the unanimous opinion of her ministers, that full powers must immediately pass the great seal to authorize them to meet, and treat with the ' said M. Mesnager, these powers should be laid aside• and the acceptation of the preliminaries signed by lord Dartmouth and Mr. St. John, by virtue of a warrant directed to them two only, signed by the queen at top and bottom, arid countersigned by nobody. No. 6.

Where the obstruction arose to the passing these powers, does not appear to the committee; but those ministers seem conscious to themselves of what was doing, who so readily concurred in privately meetipg, conferring, and treating, with the ministers of France, till

this separate negotiation was brought to maturity; But avoided to become parties when the treaty was to be signed and executed,

This great care and caution for their owif persons, and little regard for the honour and interest of their queen pnd country, appears through this whole separate negotiation; It being very remarkable thpt there is not one paper of powers or instructions throughout the whole affair countersigned by any one minister, but the queen’s name exposed to cover all; -which looks as if they flattered themselves, that this omission of their duty would be sufficient to skreen them from the justice of the nation, if these matters should ever come to be enquired into.

After such a sacrifice made of the general interest of Europe, such a direct violation of Che grand alliance, and such unwarrantable and illegal steps taken in transacting and concluding these special preliminaries between England and France, it had been but reasonable to expect in them some very particular advantages and concessions, made to Great Britain, to atone for such unprecedented transactions; but it is astonishing to, find bow insignificant all the demands are, that were made on the part of Great Britain; and, inconsiderable as they wbre, how ineffectual they have since been rendered.

Nothing possibly could be said less with regard to the succession, than what is here demanded in. the first article. The queen, not yet acknowledged by France, nor designed to be so, till the conclusion of the peace, as France afterwards explained this article at the general congress; not a word of removing the Pretender, por any engagement not to support him in any attempt he might make upon the nation. '

The second Article offers a Treaty of Commerce, in such doubtful words, as France only could make advantage of.

In the Article of Dunkirk, the equivalent i» expressed in so strong a manner, and the demolition so very loosely; as could not but bring certain and great prejudice to our allies, with very little prospect of advantage to ourselves; and fatal experience has convinced us, what security is procured for our navigation by this third article. But the history of this will be further explained in its proper place.

The fifth and seventh Articles chiefly regard the Assiento contract; what a national advantage that is like to be, is now too well understood to want much explanation; But with: what views the ministers were so fond of this, as to make it their chief care and concern, will no longer be a doubt, when it shall appear that this part of the treaty was calculated only for private advantage.

What the ministry themselves thought most valuable in these articles, was that part of the seventh which grants'us an advantage of 15 per cent, upon our manufactures sent to Spain:But this great advantage soon vanished into nothing; and was given up by our ministry

ix] APPENDIX. — Negotiations far 1715, {jc

here. The.bishop of Bristol says indeed of it, in his letter of the 17th August, 1712, That it was granted by the French with a design either to inflame things between us and the Dutch, or to give the French a pretence to stipulate for themselves such particular advantages in the Spanish trade as may be the ruin of ours.

But what is most remarkable in the seventh Article is the introduction to it, in which the ministry confess themselves to have been, imposed upon by France; for they declare that from the first propoals of M. de Torcy to that time, they always understood, that by the real securities promised in those proposals, were meant places; which now was absolutely refused; and they consent to take for real securities what they confess is none, but what a love of peace may induce them to accept as an equivalent.

What was really of most importance to England-was the eighth article, which relates .to HudsonVbay and Newfoundland; but the ministry suffered themselves to be so grossly imposed upon in this article, that they directly give to France all they wanted, which was a liberty of taking and drying their fish:whilst France gives nothing at all to us, but refers our most valuable interests to the general confe- rences:Which was but another manner -of denying them, as the event has sufficiently shewn.

We demand in the sixth Article, that we shall have all the privileges that have been or shall be granted by Spam to the subjects of France or any other nation. Whereas the ministers ought to have insisted i that France should not upon any pretence whatsoever be permitted to trade to the Spanish West Indies, which they would not have omitted, if they had had the least regard to the trade of Great Britain, or had not entirely forgot the eighth arti-- cle of the grand alliance; wherein it is expressly stipulated, as a condition without which - no peace shall be made, neque insis ibidem.’ (that is, the French in the Spanish West-Indies) ‘ Navigatio Mercature exercendae causa sub quocunque prsetextu, direct^ vel indirect^ permittatur.’ One thing further is to be observed Of these articles, that such of them as any way relate to Spain are expresly granted in the name and by virtue of powers given by king Philip, and yet after this, all intentions of leaving any part of the Spanish monarchy to king Philip is publicly disavowed; as will afterwards appear.

This short view of these special prelimina-1 rics sufficiently demonstrates, that the interest of Britain was not the inducement to our ministers to proceed in this extraordinary manner. Yet trivial as these advantages are, France is pressed that they may be first adjusted; to what use and purpose is fully explained in the draught of answers upon the conferences with M. Mesnager, “ That our ministers may be •enabled to. engage the queen to make the conclusion of the general peace easy to France.”

It is declared, that to settle the interests of ' Great Britain in the first place is a principle from which the queen can never depart; tni» plea was made use of, to defer the interests of all the allies, to be discussed at general confe* rences; but the turn given to it here was to arouse the people, by persuading them that tins English ministry was contending for great ant) particular advantages and-concessions to be made to Great Britain, that might make u$ some amends for that great and unequal burthen which we had lain under through the wholq course of the war.

But the English ministry having thought fit every where to extol and magnify the vast advantages that were granted to Great Britain, France resolved to make a proper use of and declared these articles were an eveutuai or conditional treaty only; and that the king of France would not be obliged to make them good, but in case of the signing of ageneral peace; iq this sense M. Mesnager signed them, and with "this condition they are accepted on our part. Hard terms ! That such concessions as these were not to be purchased at a less price than forcing upon our allies such conditions of peace as France should be pleased to impose upon them: and this the ministry were fully apprized of some time before they were accepted; for in pressing to settle and adjust singly and‘ separately the interests of Great Britain, they enforce it by saying France can run no risk in such engagements, since the special preliminaries will have no effect till a general peace shall be signed.

By these means the Committee observe to how fatal a dilemma the queen was brought her ministry; she must either now go on through all adventures in the measures of France, or they had it in th'eir power, by divulging the secret, and exposing such a notorious breach of national faith, to make what advantage they thought fit of it among the allies, who must from this time think themselves disengaged from the queen, if they could find their own account by looking after themselves.

And that the French were neither so ignorant, nor wanting to themselves, as to mist such an opportunity, appears above three months before these articles were signed-When lord Raby in his letter of the 20th of June, 1711, N. S. to Mr. St. John, acquaints him that both the Pensionary end M. Vender Dussen had seen a letter from M. de Torcy, giving an account that they had begun a negotiation in England.

By this management the . English ministry had, under colour of the queen’s authority, and the preteuce of treating a peace, put it'm the power of France to divest the queen of all her allies, and given them greater advantages then they could any other ways have hoped tor.

On the same day that the Special PreUmiaa-ries betwixt Great Britain and France «vei«e signed, which it was a fundamental condition should be concealed with the utmost secrecy, another set of General Preliminaries on .the

xi] APPENDIX. — Report relating to the [xii

part of France, No. 7, were signed by M. Mesnager only; which Mr. St. John, in his letter to the queen, says, were to be sent into Holland, as the foundation of a general peace, in which my lord treasurer had made some alterations to make the whole more palatable abroad. And on the same day, a separate Article was signed in favour of the duke of Savoy, which is here annexed. No. 7.

From this time a perfect confidence was established between the two ministries of England and France; and in the letters written m the month of October, a mutual ^sincerity is recommended and engaged fyr, and that a perfect unanimity be'maintained for accomplishing the work in hand.

Lord Strafford's Instructions in order to his immediate return into Holland were now pre-’ paring, and dated Oct. 1, O. S. 1711. And as an early proof of the confidence which Mr. St. ^ohn reposed in the French minister, he acquaints Monsieur de Torcy by his letter of Oct. 2, O. S. that the earl of Strafford was going for Holland; and says, Your minister, ^meaning M. Mesnager; who was then going Lack to France and carried this letter,) is fully Informed in what the earl of Strafford is to propose to the States.

Such intelligence of the queen’s counsels, which Mr. St. John confesses he bad given to the ministers of the queen’s enemies, seems very extraordinary; especially if it be considered, that lord Strafford was sent over to press the opening the general conferences, with assurances of the greatest friendship and concern for the interest of the States, on the part of the queen, and by her authority to procure from France just satisfaction for all her allies; and in his instructions is likewise directed to propose to the States anew scheme for carrying on the war, and to acquaint them with such resolutions as the queen had taken concerning it.

Lord Strafford’s Instructions are hereunto annexed, No. 8, wherein almost every article is a specimen of the sincerity with which our ministers intended to treat the allies. He is instructed that it must be the most careful endea-rour and fixed principle of all the confederates to hold fast together; and this immediately after a separate treaty had been signed by us; and if the ministers of Holland should express any uneasiness at their apprehensions of any auch private agreement, he is ordered by evasive answers to avoid giving them satisfaction •concerning it. But his chief business1 wad to deliver to the States the Propositions signed by M. Mesnager, as the foundation of a general peace, and as the whole of what bad been transacted; and to acquaint them that France had proposed Utrecht, Nimeghen, Aix la Chappelll er liege, to be the place for opening the conferences; to press the States to fix up6n one of these places, and immediately to grant passports to the French plenipotentiaries to come thither and open the general conferences.

These Propositions, so very general and uncertain, did extremely alarm the states, as not

being a sufficient foundation upon which a negotiation might be hazarded; they dreaded the fatal consequences of opening the general conferences, before the articles offered by France wereLexplained, and made specific; and especially before they knew at all what they were to trust to, for their own barrier, and for their commerce.

These considerations, made them for some' time decline granting the passports; and in order to prevail with the queen to have some regard to her faithful allies, and particularly in the two great articles of their barrier and commerce, they sent over Monsieur Buys to intercede with her majesty to alter her resolutions; they make the same representations to the earl of Strafford, but all to no purpose. For as Mr. St. John declared in his letter to my lord Strafford of Oct. 9, “ Certain it is that her majesty has so far determined upon her measures, that those will deceive themselves who may imagine by delay or other artifices to break them.” And ajgain Nov. 2, to lord Strafford, The queen will not finally concert a lan for the prosecution of the war with the tates, until they join with her in agreeing to open the conferences of peace. And lord Strafford acquaints Mr. St. John, Nov. 15, that he bad now told them her majesty’s order to him was to declare, That she should look upon any delay as a refusal to comply with her propositions.

In these circumstances the Dutch at last comply to grant the passports, and agree to open the general conferences at the time fixed by the queen, Jan. 1, 1711-12.

The resolution of the States General upon this occasion is hereunto annexed, No. 9, as a paper that must have moved any set of men, not already determined to hear no reason but what came from France; for although the representations made by the States, on both sides the water, had made some impressions, as is evident by a memorial delivered by Mr. St. John to the abbot Gaultier, Oct. 29, 1711. No. 10, and by Mr. St. John’s letter to M. de Torcy of the same date. No. 7, that accompanied it; yet ’tis in the Memorial declared, that the queen remains firm in her first resolution of causing the conferences to he Opened upon the articles signed by M. Mesnager. The same memorial declares, it was absolutely necessary that the most Christian King should give to her Majesty the queen, such explications of his intentions in respect to the particular interests of the allies, which he shall think proper to engage them to come more easily into the general negotiation. So that hitherto it is plain, our ministers were entirely ignorant even of the King of France’s intentions with regard to the allies. And again it is said, if her majesty wishes the most Christian King would give an explication to the aforesaid demands, &c. his most Christian Majesty may assure himself, the queen will make no other use of the trust the king shall repose in her, but to advance the negotiation, in seeking the shortest meant) and

* v ^

X’rii] APPENDIX. — Negotiations f 1715. [xiv

the most effectual, to obtain a peace so much coveted.

It is therein again acknowledged, that the Dutch have nothing in view but their barrier and commerce; and provided the queen can, without fear of being disavowed, specify somewhat near the barrier that France will consent to yield to them, and to assure them of the Tariff of 1664, there is no room left to doubt that the States General would come without any further hesitation into the negotiation, in the same manner as it had_been concerted. '

But lest all these arguments should have no effect, IVJ r. St. John in his letter to M. deTorcy, says. These Explications will dissipate all clouds, and you may believe we will make use thereof with great reserve, when I assure you,

that if the king would offer a plan of specific preliminaries, the queen will never communicate it to her allies ; ” he concludes, “If the Sieur Gaultier returns with these marks of confidence, you will see our parliament as much inclinable to peace, as ever it was to war.”

Here the Committee cannot but observe the English ministry begging of France, after they had been seven months treating with them, that they may have some intimations at least of what was designed for the allies; expressing tHeir fear of being disavowed by France, after they had gone these lengths with them; declaring the Dutch would come into the queen's measures if they could but know any thing near the barrier that was designed them, and have security about their commerce; persisting still, without any such satisfaction in the measures prescribed by France, resolved to force the allies into general conferences upon loose and uncertain articles, and promising if they could but have so much credit with France as to be trusted at all, they would use it with the greatest reserve, and never communicate it to any of thd allies; for whose satisfaction only it is pretended all this submission was made.

The return made by France is to he seen in a paper called “ Answer to the Memorial brought by M. Gaultier, Nov. 18, 1711.” No. 11. This memorial is accompanied with a letter from M. d« Torcy to Mr. St. John, of the same date, wherein be tells him his majesty wholly depends upon the secrecy and good use you will make of the entire confidence he testifies to the queen of Great Britain; and the king of France extols the firmness of the queen, and sees with great pleasure the new marks of resolution she shews.

The Committee think it needless to enter into a particular disquisition of this Memorial; W observe in general, that nothing had at this time been demanded of France concerning the disposal of the Netherlands; and that the king of France, not satisfied with having secured Spain and the West Indies to his grandson, proposes to strip the Emperor of all his dominions In Italy, and to impose upon him much worse terms than he afterwards procured for himself 'when left to carry on the war alone. The Dutch may have the Tariff of 1664, with some

exceptions, if they consent to this scheme; if not, they are to be punished with the loss of their trade, and to be reduced to the Tariff of 1699.

But, extravagant as this scheme w/is, it is received by the English ministers without any surprise or resentment; and Mr. St. John, in his letter of the 25th Nov. 1711, thanks M. de Torcy for the communication of it; promises to make a discreet use of it, and to keep the contents with an inviolable secrecy, and that the utmost efforts shall be used by England to fix the pretensions of the allies; he represents it as necessary, that all those who wish for peace may mutually help one another, and endeavour to finish the treaty so soon, as not to be exposed to another campaign.

It is indeed no wonder, that this plan was never communicated to the allies, which must at once have broke off all the conferences, and determined them rather to run all hazards, than treat upon so ruinous a foundation; but it is a wonder that the English ministry were not startled when they saw such a scene opened: but this shews with what justice the ministry complained, that the allies would not enter into the queen’s measures, when they never were informed what the queen’s measures were.

Pursuant to the resolution of the States general upon the pressing instances of the queen, passports for the French plenipotentiaries were sent to Monsieur Buys, and delivered to Mr. St John. Utrecht is agreed upon here to be the place for the general conferences.

The bishop Of Bristol, then , loi*d privy seal, and the earl of Strafford, are appointed her majesty’s plenipotentiaries.

Dec. 23, 1711, her majesty's Instructions to her said plenipotentiaries are settled and signed^ and are hereunto annexed. No. 12.

The Committee thirik fit to make one observation upon these general Instructions, wherein the plenipotentiaries are ordered, M That if it shall be thought proper to begin by the disposition of the Spanish monarchy, you are to insist that the security and reasonable satisfaction which the allies expect, and which his roost Christian Majesty has promised, cannot be obtained, if Spain and the West Indies be allotted to any branch of the House of Bourbon; ” so that hitherto the queen thought fit to declare in all public acts, that Spain and the West Indies ought by ho means to be left in the possession of the House of Bourbon; although in the special preliminaries, signed by the earl of Dartmouth, and Mr. St. John, on the 27 Sept, preceding, the king of France did expressly promise to make good l the sixth Article for .himself, and for the king of Spain, pursuant to the powers which were then in hia majesty’s hands.

On the 15th Jan., 1711-12, the British plenipotentiaries arrive at Utrecht; who by their general instructions being ordered to concert measures with the ministers of the allies, and at the beginning pursuing these directions; M, de Torcy, on the 31st Jan., writes to Mr St. *

xyj ' APPBNDIXf — Report relating to the[xvi

John, and tpUs. him, “ he perceives there was not sq perfect a confidence established between the plenipotentiaries of France and Great Britain, as was to be desired: He believes therefore lie will think it proper to send to the bishop of Bristol and the earl of Strafford more precise instructions, concerning the manner in which they were to concert, their proceedings with the king’s plenipotentiaries." And in the answer to the memorial sent by M. Gaultier, March 28, 1712, it is declared “ the principal order that the king had given to his plenipotentiaries, when they set out for Utrecht, was to establish a, strict intimacy between them and the ministers of the queen of Great Britain.”

On the 29th Jan. at the first general conference, lord Strafford took occasion to declare, Jhat the queen had received the general pro* positions as a foundation for a negotiation of peace: "but that they were binding to France only, and not to the allies; to which the French ministers readily assented. But it is to be observed through the whole ^proceeding, that this is meant of the propositions signed by M. Mes-nager only, the coogress not having the least uotjee or cognizance of what was signed, both on the part of France and England too; which had been hitherto concealed, and upon all occasions publicly disowned.

On the 11th Feb. 1711-12, the French delivered a specific Explanation of the General Preliminaries, signed by M. Mesnager. No. 13.

It.must be observed, that the King of France here makes, as well as in the special preliminaries, his first offers, in the name and by virtue <jf powers from his grandson as king of Spain; how the British plenipotentiaries coQld reconcile this to their instructions, and bow their behaviour upon it is to be justified, is not very clear.

This explication was received by all the allies with the greatest indignation, and deepest concern; which had such an effect, that lord $^affotd, in his letter of the 18th Feb. 1711-J 2, sqys, the French ministers are mortified at the general discontent these offers gave; and seem to wish they had put in Tournay for the Dutcb, and St. Venant to be demolished, to have softened the matter at its first coming out.

Nor were our plenipotentiaries without their uneasinesses: They had done all they could, Iprd Strafford pays, to persuade the French to be as ample in the explication as they could, “ beiqg that is what will have a great effect, and suike the minds of unthinking people^ and make some work for reflection for the faction." The plenipotentiaries complain, they are under

Seat difficulties on all hands, for both Buys and 'esnager think they come short of what had been told them in England; and the allies then forming their respective demands in concert with each other, they want further orders: The plenipotentiaries ate at a grea, t loss how to'behave about Spain, both in regard to the particular advantages that were to be asked on the behalf of Great Biitwn, and the general disposition of it.

. But Mr. St. John soon sends them words of comfort, that Mr. Harley will set out in a few days, w ho is fully instructed in all the queen’s views and desires; “That it were to be wished this gentleman could have been sooner sent, but the hurry which we have been for soma" lime in is inexpressible; and he was too useful to be spared, ’till the House of Commons was perfectly secured to the queen’s interest, and to the measures of peace. I think I may say they are absolutely so now. He confesseth the French plan to he too scanty. That they must let the French ministers know, that the whole turns upon their manner of proceeding, her majesty having gone further than could have been expected from her in promoting the peace."

The Committee cannot but take notice of the reflection that is cast here upon that House of Commons; as if they were secured to the queen’s interest, and the measures of peace, by the management of a secretary to the treasury, a near relation and a trusty agent of the lord high treasurer.

For whose use and service Mr. Harley had been so well employed at home, and was now to be sent abroad, cannot be a doubt, since Mr. St. John thought it necessary to give M. de Torcy an immediate account of his successful endeavours here, and the business he was sent abroad to manage.

In his letter of March 4, to M. de Torcy, he tells him, “ He had deferred writing of late, till he might write with certainty; till the necessary dispositions were made among our people at home; and till the queen had taken the only resolution, which could bring us in a short time to ft good and solid peace. I have now

the satisfaction to tell you that this resolution is taken, and that Mr. Harley will carry with him this night, or tomorrow morning, the final instructions of the queen to her plenipotentiaries.

£ refer myself to M. Gaultier, to explain to you more at large the subject of this gentleman’s commission; and what the queen hopes his most Christian majesty will do to co-operate with her.”

These Instructions of Mr. Harley do not appear; but it seems the subject of them was not proper to be committed to writing; for which reason, as in almost all matter^ relating to the Pretender, it is referred to M. Gaultier to explain them; but what is meant by the necessary dispositions made among our people here at home, is pretty well explained by M, de Torcy, in a memorial dat^d the 28th March 1712, in answer to what was brought by M. Gaultier; wherein he commends the prudent conduct of the court of Britain, in managing the House of Commons, and in particular their wise conduct in making known to th? House of ' Commons, that the nation was abused by its allies; and savs, the king of France assures himself that those who now manage with so much capacity the affairs of the queen of Great Britain, know how tp curb the passion of the turbulent party in the other House.

* In the mean time the allies, having each of them drawn up their respective demands at TJtrecht, met together on the 4th March, N. S. to communicate them to each other, as had been concerted, and likewise agreed that a clause should be inserted in their respective demands, for a just and reasonable satisfaction for all the rest. Count Zinzendorff further insisted that the restitution to the whole Spanish monarchy should be expressly mentioned. The Dutch delare they were resolved to intake good all their treaties, made on occasion of this war, as well those that related to Spain add the Indies, as those made with Portugal.

What the behaviour of the British ministers Was upon this occasion, will best appear by an extract of their own letter of March 6th, wherein they give an account of the whole proceeding, No. 14. They were the only ministers that did not make any mention at all of Spain and the Indies; and were sensible of the disadvantageous consequences of being so; they were desirous to take oif this odium, by seeming to say something, and in, reality to say nothing; which they do by a general declaration concerning the just and reasonable satisfaction for the queen’s allies, in conformity to her alliances; and humbly hope What was said, will not be found contrary to what has hitherto been declared.

On the 5th March the specific demands of the allies were delivered to the French plenipotentiaries in writing; they promice to explain themselves further upon them at the next conference, which was to be the 9th, and then desired a further time to the 30th.

On the 30th the French plenipotentiaries declare they were ready to proceed in the negotiation by debating with the several alliesj but would give no answer in writing.

This was a great surprize to all hut the British ministers, whom the French had beforehand advised with. The allies still resolved to press the French to answer in writing, and solicit the British ministers to jnin with them in it; who, that no mark of disagreement might appear (as their lordships express themselves in their dispatch of the 1st April, 1712) did finally consent to an instance that was to be made the next day, to require an answer in writing.

But lord Strafford had before given Mr. St. John an account of his opinion in his letter of the 25th March; wherein he says, u I cannot help saying I believe the French have taken the wisest part not to answer in writing, though most of the ministers of the allies will be surprized, expecting they should; ” and says further, “ I believe it is best they should first begin in the open congress to reason upon some of the allies demands, which will occasion so much difficulty that the ministers of the allies will propose debating separately, which had better come from them than any one else.

The French ministers still persist in their refusal, upon which the states came to a resolution at the Hague, not to treat unless an answer was given in writing. ' *

Vol. VII.

However the French continue obstinate. Lord Strafford sends an account that a resolution was taken at the Hague to carry things tp an extremity; up*n which occasion Mr. St. John expresses himself in this manner, April 5, 1712, “ That he hopes the resolution taken at the Hague to carry things to an extremity, was the last convulsive pang of an expiring faction and yet this resolution was no more than to iii-, sist on a demand, in which all the allies were unanimous, and in which the British plenipo-1 tentiaries had themselves concurred,

But what made the French thus persist ity ' the resolution of giving no answer in writing, if accounted folr in lord Strafford^ letter of the (27th April, 1712, wherein he says, “ The pensionary was extremely desirous the French would answer in writing, which (it is his lord* ship’s opinion) they will evade till tbgy see what success Gaultier has had at London and in his letter of the 30th, The French will avoid giving their answer in writing, till they see all agreed betwixt their court and ours.’ ’

And, to shew that the French were very well satisfied with the method their business was in, the plenipotentiaries in their letter of April 15, 1712, say “ They cjo not find the, French are much convinced of the necessity of 1 dispatch; arid when any thing' is let* fall of breaking off the conferences, they seein to take it with a great air of indifference; well knowing their business was not to be done of Utrecht, but by a negotiation carried on directly betwixt London and Versailles.

I About the beginning of Apyil, Mr. Harley apdM. Gaultier arrived at Utrecht; in a very few days after, the French plenipotentiaries communicate to the lord privy seal and earl of Strafford a plan for a general peace, to which they had added, by way of marginal notes, in a distinct column, what they are told will be absolutely necessary in order to a general peace: But this is entrusted to them under the, highest obligation of secrecy, to discover nothing of it to the rest of the allies.

Our plenipotentiaries accept this plan as mark of the great confidence France had in them} and readily engage that the allies should not be permitted to know a word of it: and under the same caution sent it to the secretary. But there is no room to doubt, blit this plan, that was transmitted to England as a great discovery, was concerted here, and sent by Mr^ Harley to Utrecht, and by Abbot Gaultier to France.

Mr. St. John much concerned at the behaviour of the allies, and the Dutch in particular, thinks it proper to make one attempt more, as he calls it, to gain them; and therefore orders the plenipotentiaries to acquaint them, that her majesty will consent to theii* having Dendermond and Ghent, and at the same time depart from her pretensions to Ostend; and if willing that the trade to Spain and the Spanish Indies be settled upon the same foot as it sub* sisted At the death of the late king of Spain, (B)

inafl raspec|S, «xcef>t the auiento: and their lordships are ordered to tell them in very plain terms, (hat her majesty's measures will be taken according to the return they make to the queen fn this occasion.

‘ But at the same time no communication at all is made to the states, of the general plan of peace last delivered by M. Gaultier, as there never had been of any other, * although in this last the interests of all the allies were settled and’ determined between Great Britain and Prance.

v And to shew how candidly we dealt with the queen's good friends and allies, the Dutch, as her majesty was pleased to stile them, the 15, per cent, upon all the goods and manufactures of Great Britain^ which was offered at first as one of the chief bribes to England to come into this destructive peace, M. Mesnager had now explained away, and coofined to such

foods as were carried, not to Spam, but to* the panishWest Indies only; and our ministers finding that France would not make this effectual, Mr. Harley is ordered to let it drop. But seethe use that is to be made of thisinsince-. jityof the French; at the same time that Mr. St. John aeqaints our plenipotentiaries with her majesty's consent to give this up, he tells them, “ But you will take care to do this in such a manner, as- not only to get something* for it another way, but also to render this concession of the queen's a means of bringing the Dutch to reason, and to a compliance with iter majesty's measures." '

, Lord privy seal, April 29th, 1712, acquaints Mr* Secretary, our negotiation is at a stand, till the French ministers are ready to return one answer orother )and May the 10th, 1712, the plenipotentiaries say “ The French tell us they can't think of giving in their answer to the allies, till they bear from England the success of M. Gaultier; and you may believe we wait for it with no less impatience than they do."

Mr. St. John, May Sd, 1712, acquaints their excellencies, “ I hope in a few days my dispatches will become more material, and that we shall he able either to satisfy our friends at' Utrecht, or not have reason to be much concerned at their uneasiness."

' This ends in lord Strafford's being sent for into England, and the following orders are sent to the lord privy seal for his further conduct, M You are to stop aH instances for procuring the tariff of 1664 to the Dutch; you are to decline absolutely to confer any further with (diem upon any matter, till you receive the

Jueen’s plan from hence, and that you will not, hope, be tong in expectation of; and her majesty finds so dfa return made by the states to her condescension towards them, that she likewise orders your lordship to take the first solemn, opportunity af declaring to the Dutch ministers^ that all her offers for adjusting our differences were founded upon this express, condition, that they pane immediately into the queen's measures, and acted openly and sin-oerelywith her; and that she looks upon he*-

self, from their conduct, now to be under no obligation whatsoever to them."

The Summary then of this whole proceeding at Utrecht in one short view appears to be this; a congress for general conferences was necessary to be opened, that the allies might in appearance, agreeable to the grand alliance, have the opportunity of treating and adjusting their several pretensions. '

Our ministers were by their instructions to act in concert with the allies; but they really acted in concert with the French plenipotentiaries.

The allies giving in their specific demands was not to be avoided; but the French were to gain as much time as they possibly could, by unnecessary delays; and at last insist upon such a method of answering these demands, as they knew the allies could not comply with. In the mean time the negotiations were carrying on directly betwixt England and France, or rather all the conditions dictated and prescribed by France; whilst the allies were amused with a dispute about the method of answering, from which France would not, and they could not possibly depart; in which England agreed with the rest of the allies. All particulars that concerned even the interest of the allies were transacted betwixt the ministers of England and France, tinder the highest obligations of secrecy:the Dutch are pressed to come into the queen’s measures, without being acquainted what the queen's measures were; and because they would not donsent to they knew not what, as soon as it was resolved to send orders to the duke of Ormond not to engage in either siege or battle, and the great projects were ready to .be executed on the other side of the water; the queen declares she looks upon herself now, firom their conduct, to be under no obligation whatsoever to the 9tates general; and thus the alliance betwixt Great Britain and her principal ally is declared to be dissolved and cancelled, before any thing was. finally agreed and concluded betwixt us and France; or we had the least security for our own trade and commerce, or any other advantages that were to accrue to Great Britain.

During these negotiations at Utrecht, and the disputes that had been industriously raised and kept on foot; the two great points of the renunciation of the Spanish monarchy, and of the cessation of arms, had been upon the anvil.

The first mention that is made of the renunciation in order to be treated of, is fouqd in a memorial dated March 28th, 1712, intituled, fi The Answer to the Memorial brought by M. Gaultier the 23d March, 1711-12:" thitmemb-rial which was received in France the 23d of March is suppressed, but the contents of it may in a great measure be collected from the answer that was given to it. Thus much, appears certain, that as the general proposal that the crowns of France and Spain should never be united arose first from England, and was made an article in the private propositions sent

over by Mr. Prior; so from that time to this, in France, that God alone can abolish that lavvi .. Lr ' J ' upon which your right of succeSSion'is found *

ed; but you will give us leave to be1 persuaded in Great Britain, that a prince Way depart from his right by a voluntary xfcifeioh, and that he, in favour of "whom that renunciation is made, maybe justly supported "in h»S pretensions, by the powers that become guarantees of the treaty. In short, Sir, die queen commands me to tell you that this article is of so great consequence, as well for herself as for the rest of Europe, for this present age as for posterity, that she will never agree to continue the negotiations of peace, unless the expedient she has proposed be accepted, or some other equally solid.” ': '

M. de Torcy, in answer to this letter, April the 8th, N. S. begins to think it cannot be impossible to find an expedient to settle this great affair; and he proposes that When the king of Spain shall become either immediate successor, or presumptive heir to the crown of France, he shall then declare the choice he intends to make; either to maintain his right to the crown of France, or keep that of Spain; that king Philip shall become party to the treaty, wherein the succession to the two crowns shall be likewise settled; and that all the powers of Europe shall enter into an engagement with France to maintain it.

Mr. St. John, April the 6th, O. S. reesdns against this last proposal, and the several projects contained in M. de Torcy *s last letter'; insists that no expedient can effectually secure Europe from the dangers wherewith it is threatened by the union of the two monarchies, unless the prince, who is at present in posset* sion of Spain, makes his choice at this Very in-, stant; and, upon a supposition that the crown of Spain would be his choice, that this deda* ration should be made daring the congress at Utrecht. '

April 36th, N. S; M. de Torcy, seeming dfc-way to comply with what was desired, agrees that the catholic king most calm the uneasiness of Europe in declaring from, the present time what part he will take, if ever the soccesston of France is open in his favour. That the inconveniences arising from- hence must submit «• the public good. “ Thus, Sir, w says M. de Torcy to Mr. St. Joho, “ the king approving your proposition, dispatches a courier to Spain, and writes to the king his grandson, to let him know the necessity of resolving on the choice he shaft make; and to declare it; to the end it may be inserted on the treaty of the general peace, and be made a condition of it, whereof-aH Europe shall be guarantee And promised to use all possible means, even force, if it Were necessary, to make the king of Spain agree to > it. He hopes this proposition will in a great measure remove all difficulties; and*' as they .must expect new obstructions from- those who would willingly break the conferences, be be*-

the method of preventing that Union does not appear to have been once mentioned. The sense of France and Spain upon that important article was not known, nor so much as asked; although in every step France had given plain indications, that the crown of Spain was to remain to king Philip; and the committee is surprized to find the ministry had gone such lengths in promoting the measures of France, without taking the least precaution, or having any satisfaction, concerning the mo* narchy of Spain; wherein the interest of Great Britain was by their own confession more immediately concerned, than in all the other articles of the peace put together.

But it is plain that in this memorial sent from England, the scheme for preventing this anion was first proposed by England, and that the expedient was a renunciation: and as this is a matter of such importance as deserves the greatest attention:that it may be seen in its true light, the committee have annexed the extract of the Answer to the said Memorial, and the several letters that passed betwixt M. de Torcy and Mr. St. John upon this subject; No. 15.

In this Memorial M. de Torcy declares in the strongest terras, “ That the renunciation desired would be null and invalid by the fundamental laws of France, according to which laws the most near prince to the crown is of necessity the heir thereto; it is an inheritance that he receives, neither from the king his predecessor, nor from the people, but from the benefit of the law; so that when one king dies, the other succeeds him forthwith, without asking the consent of any person whatsoever. He succeeds not as heir, but as the master of the kingdom, the seignory whereof belongs unto him, not by choice, but by right of birth only. — He is not- beholden for his crown either to the will of his predecessor, or to any edict, nor to any decree, nor to the liberality of any person, but to the law. This law is looked upon, as the work of him who hath established all monarchies, and we are persuaded in France, that God only can abolish it. No renunciation therefore can destroy it; and if the king of Spain should renounce, for the sake of peace, and in obedience to the king his grandfather, they would deceive themselves that received it as a sufficient expedient to prevent the mischief we propose to avoid. *

Then be gives an account of the disposition made of the succession to die crown of Spain by king Philip and registered in the councils of Spain; which disposition lie proposes uiay be confirmed by the present treaty of peace, and ratified by the Cortes or states of the kingdom of Spain.

Mr. St. John in his Answer, March 93d, 1711-18, 0. S. rejects this proposal, and not at all convinced by what M. de Torcy had so strongly urged concerning the nullity of the renunciation, insists still upon it-; “ We are ready, " says be, “ to believe you arepeieuaded

they ground their hopes upon (be event of the campaign.

April 39di»0. $. Mr. St. John answers this letter, and treats this proposal as liable to all the objections of the former, and argues thus upon it. u Although the king of Spain should at this instant declare his choice; What greater security will Europe have, if the execution of that choice he deferred to another time ? In offering that lie shall be obliged to declare his choice at'this present time, you tjgree, that either the stipulations of a' treaty, oqr the guarantee of the powers engaged in the present war, would be sufficient to secure that the choice shall be made; how then can we conclude that they will be sufficient to se-eure, that, when the case shall happen, he shall tjuit one crown to accept of the other, according to the choice which he shall now make:” tie goes on, « The queep j^as often declared, that it will be impossible for her to be content, wjtli any expedient which shall not be very solid, upon an article of so great importance ps t^e reunion of the two monarchies. This wopld be to lose the fruit, of all the blood which ih^ Julies had spilt inthp course of this war; this would be to betray the common cause of Europe; and to expose both the present age and posterity to greater dangers than it is possible to imagine.” In short, he insists u that they must take care that the time shall never be, when the same prince shall have the crown of Spain upon his head, and the succession to the crown of France open to him.” He at last ” proposes, “ Ii the king ojf Spain prefers the expectation of the crown of France, to the present possession of §pain, in such case be ?hal| withdraw forthwith with his family opt of Spain, the possession of which, and of the Indies, should he given to the debe of Savoy; that king Phifip should have the kingdom of Sicily and the hereditary dominions Of the duke of Savoy, together with the Monfexat and Mantua, all which dominions he should remain possessed of, though he hecaine king of France; excepting Sigily, which in that case should return to the house of Austria.”

May the 18th, N. S. M- deTorcy, still yielding and complying with the measures of Fug-land, shews the great hardship tire king of Spain must undergo, in sacrificing his own, and the interest of bit family* for the establishing a general peace; however, the king of France yyouldsend t qhim to know his mind upon the two alternatives. In the. mean time the king of France promises that the treaty of peace shall be.made, upon the foundation of one of

Eitwo propositions; either that the king of n jtliall renounce his right to the crown of ice, and keep Spain and the. Indies; . or if he prefer^ tup expectation upon France, he shall quit Spain and the Indies tp the duke of Savoy, ?U exchange for the present dominions of the duke of Suvqy, iSpc. as proposed by Mr. St. John.. He hopes by this promise of the king of France* all uncertainties are removed; and submits tft mdqm, to consider

what method would be the most conducive to the general good. “ It would be very unhappy if any event, during the campaign, should fall out to disturb the good dispositions that are. seen at present for establishing the public reposes.”

This correspondence between the two secre-ries for preventing the union of the two king-, doras, carried on from.about the middle of March to the ISth of May, 1719, ended at last just as it began; and king Philip chose to make the renunciation. The French minister giving us such early notice, and telling us so very plainly, that what we asked was utterly insufficient, and would be for ever deemed by the unalterable laws of France null and void, is very remarkable. His dexterity in managing that part of the negotiation, in. seeming always to comply, and desirous to come as near as possible to the proposals made from hence, and submitting at last since we would have it so, to the renunciation so peremptorily insisted on, is no less observable.

But it is unaccountable bow the English ministry, when they were expressly toid those would deceive themselves, who should accept of a renunciation as a sufficient expedient to prevent the re-union of the two monarchies; when they laid it d°wn themselves, as a principle never to be departed from, that the union of the two monarchies would be (be greatest mischief .that could. possibly happen to all Europe, and to Cheat Britain in particular; should still persevere in relying upon this expedient of a renunciation. And it cannot bfe forgot, that no <care was taken to render ef-. fectual the two only expedients, that were ever proposed for adding any degree of real security tq the renunciation; Which were, to have it} solemnly accepted by the states of and to haye it confirmed by a general guaranty, of allthe powers of Europe engaged in the. present war. The first was asked indeed; hut upon a refusal of France, was entirely given up by our ministry: The second by our method of negotiating, and our treatment of thn allies, was from that very time rendered impracticable; as the French could not but fore-, see. It must be remembered, that a few day a after this answer of M* de Torcy was received, Mr. St. John sent orders to the British pleat* potentiates to declare to the states general, the queen was now under no further obligations whatsoever to them, who with the rest of the allies were to be guarantees of this treaty.

The Committee think it proper to mention here a passage in a letter from the lords, plenipotentiaries to Mr, St. John, Feb. 26, 1711-1%

N. S. who acquaint him, that in some discourse with the marefchal D’Cxelles upon occasion of the death of the Dauphin, they desired to know of him, what those'measures are which France offers to take in order to prevent the union of the t«o kingdoms; and whether they were to consist in real or verbal securities; the French minister .pretended to know no otha* but of tha latter sort* And th Ujey suggest

xxv 1 APVWWJX‘~N€gowtm*f* Ptact .*171 5. [xaaJ

to Mr. St. John, that an obligation upon king Philip to renounce the regency as well as the crown of France, for himself and his posterity, would amount to some degree of real security. But no endeavours were used to obtaiu this, nor any mention made of it, as far as appears.

Mr. St. John, as secretary of state, transacted this affair with M. de Torcy; bat as it cannot easily he supposed, that he did this without the advice and approbation of the lord treasurer, as first minister; so it appears, that at the same time a correspondence was held betwixt the lord treasurer and M. de Torcy: Mr. St. John says in his letter of the 24th April, 1712, he was forced to stop the courier which he designed to dispatch the day before, to wait for a letter which my lord treasurer writes to

M. de Torcy; and April 11th, he was obliged to stop the courier till today, in hopes that lord treasurer would be in a condition to answer M. de Torcy’s letter, but the defluxion in his eyes, which has hindered him for five days, still continues. And April 26th, M. de Torcy is very much concerned for the indisposition of my lord treasurer, and ardently wishes he may soon recover. “ It is very important/' says he, “ that those who, like you and him, have had the principal share in the work of peace; Should have thfe glory, of finishing it."

M. de Torcy's letter of the 18th May, N. S. was received by Mr. St. John the 9th May,

O. S. and the promise of the king of France to oblige his grandson to accept the alternative of the two kingdoms had so good and sudden an effect, that the day following, without waking the return of the courier from Madrid, to know whether king Philip did consent or not to the proposal; orders are sent to the duke of Ormond by Mr. St. John to avoid engaging in any siege, or hazarding a battle till further order. And he is directed to disguise the receiptof this order. Her majesty thinks he cannot want pretences for conducting himself so as to answer her ends, without owning that, which at present might have an ill effect if it were publicly known.

On the same day that these orders are sent to the qneen's general with directions to disguise them, which was to conceal them from the confederates, they are conmuwicated to <be quean's enemies. Abbot Gaultier will give you an account, says Me. St. John to. M. de Torcy, of the orders I have just now dispatched to the duke of Ormond. What Mr. bt. John himself thought of the importance of thk order is to be learned from his letter to Mr. Prior, Sept. 19, 1719. The moment 1 read the queen a letter from M. de Torcy, by which it appeared that the king of France would oblige nis grandson to accept of the alternative of quitting one of the. two, monarchies, her orders were dispatched to the duke to engage in neither siege or battle; and she prevented the French from even making the demand. I will not say that this order saved their army; but I think in my conscience that it did.

* - Oo th»44tb May, *713, Mr. St. John writes

again to, M. da Taccy, although they hadyet

received no answer from Madrid concenamg the renunciation, but being pressed in time, and finding it necessary for the , queen to .aaaka the communication to parliament, that»sbe had promised, of the terms on which a .'•pence might be hiade; he acquaints-bins witlrtbe steps the queen was resolved to take; provided the most Christian King will tender them-practicable for her. And in n Memorial of the same date, No. £2, specifies the condstions upoe which her majesty consents to make such hn* portent steps, and decisive declarations to her parliament, as these which follow. First; that she had settled with France the interests of Great Britain. Secondly, that she looks' upon the interests of the other powers engaged with her in the war, as easy to be adjusted; since; the king offers to the greatest part' of them very near what they have demanded, sod to alt a just and reasonable satisfaction. Thirdly, that she will set about accommodating the affairs of her allies; and that, .to prevent all the obstructions which the events of the campaign might occasion of the negotiations of peace, she had agreed wkhtbe king to a suspension of arms.

The conditions specified in the memorial, are demands relating to North America, to: commercc, and the suspension of arms.

In the article concerning Commerce, it » said. That several points relating to trade r*- quiring a longer discussion than the present crisis would admit, and the queen being ttiUfchr more intent upon securing the general peace; than any particular advantages; demands at present only the two following conditions, ' First, that commissaries should be named oi» both sides to meet at London, there to examine and settle the duties and impositions to he paid respectively in each kingdom.

stilled into the-minds of the people, that the great advantages in trade and commerce secured to Great Britain, were the chief inducements to the ministry to engage in these measures with France, it is here declared they were more intent upon the general peace, than any particular advantages. And whereas it was laid down as a principle from which the queen would never depart, that the interests of Great Britain should in the first place be adjusted; and the great advantages stipulated for these nations, before the conclusion of the peace, were to justify the peace, and all the steps that were taken to procure it; it is now evident that no mention was made of our trade in Spspn; and for our commerce in general; the settling of that was postponed, and all points in dispute, betwixt Great Britain and France, were to be referred to commissaries; which proposition was not demanded, but voluntarily offered by Mr. St. John.

On the 8th June, N. S. 1712, M. de Torcy sends an account, “ That the king of Spain, of the two propositions, had chosen to keep Spain and the Indies, and to renounce, for lumself and his descendants, the right to the crown of France. This principal obstacle to the peace being removed, the king of France expects that the queen will now clear, on her side, the rest of the difficulties, which may obstruct this great work; by making such declarations as had been promised upon the return of the courier from Madrid, and as are necessary for this end. The king thinks the first t and most urgent is, to settle a suspension of arms, either general, or at least between the two armies in the Low Countries, which rtiay continue till the conclusion of the peace.”

On the 10th June, N. S. M. de Torcy ac* v knowledges the receipt of Mr. St. John’s letter of the 24th of May, O. S. together with the memorial; and sends another Memorial in answer to it, containing the king of France’s answer to these last demands of the queen, No. 23.

He takes notice, that the letters from the Army mention a design to invest Quesnoy, in order to besiege it; but the king cannot think that the queen approves of such an undertaking, much less that her troops shall be employed to1 render it successful: He concludes, that if a suspension is not immediately made, we may find ourselves indispensably drawn into some great event, which he hopes the secretary’s prudence and care will prevent. And although in the answer to the queen's demands; nothing material that was asked for our trade in North America is granted ^, the evacuating of Dunkirk, and admitting an English garrison js not agreed to, and the receiving a Dutch garrison into Cambray is absolutely refused, which were proposed as conditions of the suspension of arms, M. de Torcy hopes that this return to the queen’s demands will occasion fio new trouble, put as the beginning and whole course of this negotiation was carried on upon the bona, and a mutual confidence q which they had

seen the good effects; it is necessary to banish all distrust, and the queen to repose an intirc confidence in his majesty, without insisting on demands which may serve only to create jealousies.

On the 6th June, O. S. Mr. St. John owns the receipt of M. de Torcy’s two letters of the Sih and 10th June, N. S. and sayS, “ although the King of France had not answered 'the queen’s demands according to expectation, which were the conditions on which the queen was to make such peremptory and decisive declarations; yet the queen would not defer going that day to parliament, and making all the declarations that were necessary to render the nation unanimously inclined to the peace; that she had not indeed mentioned to the parliament the suspension of arms, but had commanded him to acquaint M. de Torcy with the resolutions she had taken in relation to it, and insisting upon the renunciation as the capital point of the negotiation; and for which, her majesty would rather depart from almost all the points that bad been agreed upon, than leave that to any uncertainty. Upon this foundation the queen hopes, that the most Christian King will not find any thing offensive in the demands, which she found herself obliged to renew, being conditions for a suspension of arms between the two armies in the Netherlands; which if the king consents to, ” says Mr. St. John to M. de Torcy, “ you have only to sign and send to the duke of Ormond, who, at the same time that he takes possession of Dunkirk, will declare .to the allies, that he has orders to act no further against France.” He acquaints him that “ Lord Strafford was going back to Utrecht, that the instructions he was to carry will, according to your desire, put the queen’s plenipotentiaries in a condition to keqp no longer those measures to which, they have been hitherto obliged to submit, but from henceforth they tnqy openly join with those of France, and give law to those who will not submit to just and reasonable conditions; ” and promises when lord Strafford goes, he will dispatch another courier to inform him of the orders he carries..

Your Committee think it proper to insert here and extract of a letter from the earl of Strafford to Mr. St. John, of the 30th of April, 1712, N. S. “ Thus you still see the temper here, and the time it will naturally take to get the Dutch (if they will at last settle a plan) before it can be done. You see the events . we are exposed to by the operations in the field the mean, time, and you have it by this time in your power to terminate all, and even to stop the operations of the army for a mouth, till the negotiation is ended one way or other: There is no pretence now it can be a prejudice tq us, should a cessation be made; for the former pretences are out of doors, of its being, impossible for the French to make magazines for their army to take the field as soon as. ours* and having burnt these magazines at first afi* firmed impossible to be made, for, us by that

xxix]

means to be masters of besieging either Cam* bray or Arras, and our army's marching to Paris is stopt at least for* this summer in all appearance. The French ‘are now better posted than we are; their army is much stronger. We cannot march to surprize them in other parts of their lines till we have green forage, which won't be up these three weeks at soonest. They have all their troops up, and we want a great part of ours, especially the imperialists, who it is said, cannot join the army in a month yet; so that now the advantage of a cessation of arms is on our side, if they will, for the sake of peace, consent to it. If, upon these and other considerations, a cessation is thought in England necessary, the queen must not propose it, but at the same -time be resolved to put it in execution on her side, if agreed to by the French; because such a proposition will! be sure to meet with opposition, unless backed with resolution, and may have the effect of making those who dplight in war undertake with so much the greater precipitation some desperate attempt." Upon what groundless allegations the earl of Strafford did here advise a suspension of arms, is submitted to the consideration of the House.

The Articles for a Suspension, signed by Mr. St. John, June the 6th, O. S. and the Answer, signed by M. de Torcy, June the 22d, 1712, N. S. are annexed. No. 24.

The next day, June the 7th, O. S. Mr. St. John writes a private letter to M. de Torcy, expressing the utmost confidence in the good faith of the most Christian king; thinks it necessary to hasten the peace; tells him, it trould frighten the Dutch to be told the queen will act no longer against France; and that if they dp not hasten to make their agreement, they will have a burthen upon their backs which they are not able to bear.

On the same day Mr. St. John sends to the duke of Ormond copies of the^e two last letters, and of the Memorial sent to the marquis de Torcy. They have been, " says his lordship, “ prepared by the queen's order in answer to the last express which came from France, and you will perceive by them, my lord, that the queen insists on the execution of. the article relating to Spain, and on the delivery of Dunkirk, as points without which she will not declare for a cessation of arms in the Netherlands; but if these conditions are accepted, and sent signed by the marquis de Torcy to your grace, and Dunkirk put into your possession, you are publicly to own that you can act tio longer against the French. If they are not consented to, you are intirely free from restraint, and at a liberty to take all reasonable - measures that are in your power for annoying the enemy. It is probable the marshal Villars may receive the orders, which will be seat him from Versailles, within a day after this letter will come to your hands. Your grace will therefore lose no time in acquainting him, that your expectation of hearing from his court that which must determine your pro-

[xxx

ceedings; and that, according to the king's re* solution, you are either to look upon your- selves on both sides as freed from any restrictive orders, and in full liberty of acting against, each other: or that you are openly to declare for a cessation."

The committee think it necessary now to go . a little back, and observe what Orders and Instructions had been given to the duke of Ormond, and what accounts he had sent of his proceedings during the time the correspondence relating to the renunciation was carrying on.

On the 12th of April 1712, N. 8. his Instructions are signed by the queen, No. 25. He is ordered to Tepair first to the Hague, and to see the-pensionary, before he puts himself at the head of the troops; to express to him. the queen's resolution of pressing the war with all possible vigour; to assure him he is prepared to live in a perfect good correspondence With all the generals, and particularly with those of the states; to inform himself what plan has been agreed for the operation of the campaign; And us soon as he a rives at the frontier, to meet with prince Eugene, and such of the generals as shall be in the secret, and with them to concert the proper measures for entering upon action.

' Your Committee conceive these Instructions sighed by her majesty must be the rule of his grace's actions, till countermanded or revoked by equal authority, there being no general direction in them to follow such further orders as he should receive from a secretary of state.

On the 24th of April, N. S. The duke of Ormond gives the secretary an account, “ That according to his instructions, he had given the pensionary all the assurances of carrying on the war with vigour, and, and acting in confidence with all the allies, and more especially the Dutch; which were received with the greatest professions of duty and respect to her majesty."

On the 30th, the duke of Ormond had been in conference with the council of state, where, his grace says, there were great expressions of duty to her majesty. They told him there was no particular resolution taken as to the operation of the campaign, but left it to their generals, who with their deputies are to act in concert with the generals of the allies, and that they had given orders to their generals to live in a good correspondence with his grace.

On the 25th of April, O. S. which must be observed was before it was known Fraqce bad agreed so much as to propose to the kins of Spain the alternative of the two monarchies, which was not till the 18th t>f May, N. S.' Mr. St. John begins to give the duke of Qrtaond some distant hint of the scene that was afterwards to be opened, and tells him, ?< The queen inclines to, be of opinion, that all the troops, whether subjects or foreigners ), belong- ing to her, should be immediately, under his grace's command. There may have been for-.' merly reasons for using« different method, but

APPENDIX. — Negotiations for Peace: 1711.

there seems at present to be tome of a very strong nature for1 taking this, and perhaps these may every day grow still stronger. Insinuates there may be reason to be jealous of prince Eugene; and on this occasion his grace 2s directed to be more cautious for some time of engaging in an action, unless in the case of avery apparent and considerable advantage, upon pretence of waiting till the German troops were all arrived, that they may have their share, if there is to be any action.”

On the 9th of May, N. S. The duke of Ormond acknowledges the receipt of two letters from Mr St. John of the 10th and 22d of April, neither of Which appear. But his grace says in answer to the secretary, “ I alii of your opinion, that a battle won or lost would at this time make very great alterations in the treaties now on foot; But you remember that, in my instructions, I am ordered to act in' conjunction with the allies in prosecuting the War with vigour; so that, should there happen a fair opportunity to attack the enemy, I Cannot refuse it, If proposed by the prince and States. But I hope to have the messenger before the armies are formed, which will be in 3 or dfeys.”

On the I2th of May, N. S. The duke of Ormond expresses still the same uneasiness, wishes to hear from England that the peace* is dear concluded, bet hopes, if it be delayed, we shall have the good fortune to force the French to comply with the queen’s demands.

But ms grace was now soon put out of his pain by the order, mentioned before, of May the 10th, O.S. not to engage in any siege, or

bazard a battle.

Oh the 20th of May, N., S. The duke of Ormond writes two letters to Mr. St. John, a private letter and a public letter. In the first, which was his private letter, and all wrote in his own hand, “ his grace acknowledges the receipt of his orders* not to’engage in siege or battle; to which he promises an exact obedience, and to keep secret his having received any such command, and will endeavour to hinder its being suspected. But prince Eugene and the States having proposed to' attack the enemy, or, if that be found too hazardous, to besiege Quesnoy, his grace fears it will be very difficult for him to disguise the true reason of his opposing all proposals thritshiUbeftahdte'fof undertaking any thing, having no excrisri for delays, all the troops We expect ed.atfd the Heavy cannon, being to be here on Saturday :” Ana he says if be' could have found forage here, he would have made some pretence to delay the march; though the’d repositions of it were made before he received this letter.

Briton the Same day hie grate writes another public letter to Mr. St. John, after he had received the letter of the 10th, as is expressly said; wherein he takes no notice of his orders not to engage in siege or battle, but speaks of his having reviewed the English troops, and found them in so good a condition, that must convince aft the allies he W groundless the edm-

[xkxri

plaints are that have been made of out back-1-wardness, of which he says, I believe you will now hear no more.” He goes on, “ if we find au opportunity to bring the enemy to a battle, we shall not decline jt.”

On the 88th of May, the duke of Ormond, in his letter to Mr. St. John, says, “ Yesterday prince Eugene and the States deputies desired that I would consent to send the quarter-masters to view the French camp; which I could not refuse, without giving them some suspicion of what I am ordered to disguise; but I was sure that nothing of action could happen, the enemy being behind the Schelde. The detachment that went with them were forty squadrons, and all the grenadiers of my army to support them and make good their retreat, should the enemy have endeavoured for to have attacked them. They went as far (I mean the horse) as Catelet, where the right of the enemy’s army lies, and are come back without j seeing any of' the French on our side the i Schelde.

! “ The distance between the head of the

Somme and that of the Schelde is not above j a league and a half, which is a plain; and the ' enemy have not yet offered to throw up any retrenchment: may be tomorrow they will | begin to work, since they have seen our troops j reconnoitring that way.” Prince Eugene and 1 the deputies being to dine with his grace the , next day, he was under apprehensions they:would press him to undertake something im-i mediately, which it would be very hard to con-I ceal the true reason of his refusing, having no reasonable excuse for it.

In this letter his grace gives an account of a letter that he had received from Mareschal Villars, and the answer that his grace wrote to theMareschal.

This Correspondence, which on both sides is insisted upon to be kept as the most absolute sricTet, is founded upon a postcript in Mr. St. John’s letter of May the 10th to the duke of Ormond; wherein he tells his grace “ Communication is given of this order to the coart of France; so that if Mareschal Villars takes ariy private-Way notice of it to you, your grace will answer accordingly.”

May the 25th, N. 8. Mhrrifechal Villars acquaints his grace, “ That he had the king’s orders, and the queeti of England’s consedt, to’ Write to him a$ soon as he received the cou*-net; arid Whatever glory is to be acquired against a general whose valour is so well known among them, he desires them to be assared that he never received more agreeable news than that they were to be no longer enemies.”

The duke of Ormond in answer acquaints him, That he had received orders from the' queen upon the same subject, to which he woritd.not fail to conform himself in the most' ei&Ct manner.

This is conformable to the intimation given by Mr. St. John, That if Mareschal Villars takes any private-way notice tf his orders, his grace win (o answer accordingly.

Bat Wb jgtabfe *pvticeeds -forth *, atati ‘feajs, m 'll* motion which wrote agoing‘to make is •principally for‘the‘Subsistence of otir<troops, 9o’that you need not be under any apprehension nt thn March; at least ‘1 can answer for the •queen's army, which I hare the honour to command."

Your Committee is at a loss to account'for •this transaction, unless his grace had orders nor •only to act against France, ’but to give the Trench general intelligence of all that was designed in the confederate army.

The report being made by the quarter masters general, who went with the detachment to •view the French camp, and the overture between the sources of the Somme and Schelde, and they all agreeing that the ground was as advantageous as could b* their situation being such as gave an opportunity of falling upon their dank and rear, it wns proposed to the duke of Ormond to march without the least delay to the enemy, and to attack them.

What his grace did upon this occasion is best to be learnt from his own words, in his letter of May the 29 th to Mr. St. John. et You may easily imagine the difficulty that I was under to excuse the delaying a matter, which according to the informations I bad from the quarter masters general, and several other general officeis that went out with the detach-, ment, seemed to be so practicable. The best excuse I could make was lord Strafford's sudden voyage to England, which gave me reason to believe there must be something of consequence transacting, which a delay of four or six days would bring to light; and therefore I desired they would defer this undertaking, or any other, until I should receive fresh letters from England."

Your Committee cannot better represent the favourable opportunity that was here lost to the Common cause, and the advantage, or rather deliverance, that was secured to the common enemy, than in a letter from the deputies of the States to the duke of Ormond, June the 4th, N. S. No. 26.

These Representations, and the pressing instances made by Prince Eugene, are entertained by Mr. St. John as affected alarms and clamours raised with much industry, but such as gave her majesty no uneasiness whatsoever.

But they'began to make some impressions Upon the duke ofOrmond; he grew sensible of the ill blood and dissatisfaction caused among the allies by the measures he was obliged to take, who did not stick to say we were betray-ingthem. He sends an account that Prince Eugene and the States deputies had resolved to besiege Quesnoy, which place was that day, June the 8th, N. S. 1712, invested; and though he lmd nothing to do in the Operation, 'he could not refuse furnishing some troops ih the States pay, but had avoided giving any in the queen’s whole pay.

We are-now com* again to the 7th of June

O. S. when Mr. St. John sent to the duke of Ormond his letters of the 6th and 7th to M. Vol. VII.

Me Torcy, and the last "articles pitoposed by Great Britainfor a Suspension of dims; and it is'to be observed, that hithefto it was an entire 'secret between the English and French courts, and their two generals, that neither siege Or battle was to be engaged in by the duke of Qr-mond. Prince Eugene and the whole confederacy were as yet amused with hopes that the duke of Ormond might be permitted in some degree to comply with his instructions, and the solemn and repeated assurances that had been given, to act in conjunction with the rest Of the ‘allies: but the time was now come, when the secretary's care and prudence was to deliver the French king from the apprebensibns, unddr which M. de Torcy had so often declared him to be for the events of this campaign; and although the suspension of arms was pressed and insisted upon by France, and was to be granted purely for the sdke and preservation of the French army, which in all reason should have brought them to. a compliance with the demands sent from England; yet so very tractable did our ministry prove, that France’s refusing the conditions at first proposed forgrant-inga suspension of arins, had no Other effect but to make us lower the terms upon which they were to accept what could be no advantage to England, but was of the highest importance to Frartce.

When these last conditions were sent to the duke ofOrmond, with the orders that attended them, it is to be observed, that Mr. St. John declared the queen insisted on the execution of the article relating to Spain, and on the delivery of Dunkirk, as points without which she would not declare for a cessation of arms: so that if these conditions were not absolutely consented to, if the answer from France, which was to determine the duke of Ormond’s measures, xfas not signed by M. de Torey, and Dunkirk was not put into possession of the duke of Ormond, his grace was at intire liberty to act against France; but upon these conditions the duke of Ormond was ordered immediately to declare a Cessation of arms.

The Committee cannot but think this order in itself of a very extraordinary nature, although conditional; and the ministry seem in very great haste to give all up into the hands of France, when the queen's general, at the head of a confederate array in the field, at that time covering a siege, which the allies were engaged in, should be ordered to govern himself according to such significations as Should come from the Court of France, and those transmitted him by the general commanding the enemy’s army, whose duty it was by force or stratagem to raise the siege, or gain any advantage he could over the allies.

On the 22d of* June, N. S. an Answer to the Proposals last sent over was transmitted to Mr. St. John, signed by M. de Torcy, with two alterations, one no less material, than wherea9 it was demanded that the renunciation should be ratified in the most solemn manner by the States of France, Which had been mentioned

rcj, •,

xxxv} . APPENDIX. — Report relating to the[xxxiri

before as one of the chief securities to make it as effectual as any thing could, it is here substituted, that it shall be registered in the several parliaments: and to the article of Dunkirk, is added, That all the king’s officers, both land and sea officers, shall have liberty to stay at Dunkirk, and to execute their several offices. And on the same day, M. de Torcy writes two letters to Mr. St. John, the one a public letter .explaining at large the alterations; the other a private Tetter, to prevail with him to consent to these alterations. And it may be here observed, that there are several instances of such a private correspondence Carried on between the two secretaries.

At the same time, a copy of the Memorial and the Answer was sent to the Mareschal Villars, who with his Letter of the 24th of June, N. S. sends the copies to the duke of Ormond, and tells him the originals were sent to England; and doubts but but the suspension of arms would immediately take effect.

But it appears by the duke of Ormond's letter to Mareschal Villars, of the 25th of June, That these were only copies and not signed, for his grace says, “ It were to be ' wished that M. de Torcy had given himself the trouble to sign them, as being more agreeable to his grace’s instructions; but that he may not stop so good a work, by difficulties and scruples, he will not insist upon formality:he promises to go, immediately to prince Eugene and the States deputies, to persuade them to abandon the enterprize upon Quesnoy, and ‘ to declare, That in case of a refusal, he shall be obliged to withdraw the queen's army; and as soon as the troops, which he should detach for that purpose, had taken possession of Dunkirk, the suspension of arms shall take place.”

On the 27th of June, the duke of Ormond gives Mr. St. John an account, That he had been with Prince Eugene, and the States deputies, and had acquainted them, that the French king having agreed to several articles demanded by the queen, as the foundation of a cessation of arms, he could no longer cover the siege of Quesnoy; but was obliged by his instructions to march with the queen’s troops, and those in her majesty’s pay, and to declare a cessation of arms as soon as the town of Dunkirk was delivered up.

The duke of Ormond having had this conference with prince Eugene, and the States deputies, according to his promise, sends a second letter to Mareschal Villars of the same date, and tells him, he apprehends that the generals of the auxiliaries paid by the queen, will not leave Prince Eugene’s army without particular orders from their respective masters.

An account of this being sent to the court of Prance, M. de Torcy dispatches an express, June the 27th, N. S. and declares if the foreign troops in English pay did not abandon prince Eugene’s army, the condition upon which Dunkirk was to be delivered being not performed, it would be unreasonable for England

to insist that Dunkirk should be .given into their hands; and appeals to the title of the memorial, that imported a cessation' of arms between the two armies in the Netherlands: he insists, that positive orders be sent to the duke of Ormond, to withdraw all the troops in English pay; and when these orders shall have been punctually complied with, the king will perform his promise of delivering Dunkirk.

The duke of Ormond having already declared absolutely to the allies, that he could no longer cover the siege of Quesnoy, remains in a state of inaction, though it is plain by his orders he was now free from all restraint, the answer not being signed by M. de Torcy, as was expressly required, some material alterations being made in the conditions relating to Spain, which his grace had then no nptice that the queen consented to, and Mareschal Villars refusing to give him (lie possession of Dunkirk, which

were declared points without which the queen weuld not consent to a cessation of arms.

And that the duke of Ormond was himself of this opinion, is evident from his own letter to Mr. St. John of June the 29th, N. S. wherein he excuses his deferring separating the troops and marching towards Dunkirk, until he had sufficient assurance that place would be surrendered to him: and then his grace says, “ The contrary appears now so evidently, that I should look upon myself immediately at liberty te act in conjunction with the allies: but I do not take upon me to make a step of such consequence without the queen’s particular orders, which I shall expect with the greatest impatience.”

These unexpected resolutions of the foreigners in the queen’s pay not to abandon their allies, and leave them at the mercy of the French army, very much disconcerted our measures here for a short time; but on June the 20th, O. S. (No. 27,) Mr. St.John writes to M. de Torcy, “ That the accounts from the duke of Onqond were conformable to what he had sent, which gave the queen a sensible displeasure; but as her majesty had taken a firm and unalterable resolution not to yield to any difficulties, he doubts not to succeed, and believes M. de Torcy will be convinced of this truth when he has read over this letterThat he had just then told the ministers of those princes who have troops in the queen’s pay, that unless they obey the duke of Ormond’s orders, her majesty will take it as a declaration against her, and from that time they shall not be paid:That if the French king will deliver Dunkirk, the duke of Ormond shall retire with the English troops, and all those foreigners that will obey him, and declare the queen will act no longer against France, nor pay those that will, and will make no difficulty to conclude immediately a separate peace with France, leaving the allies a time wherein they may have liberty to submit to such conditions as shall be agreed upon betwixt the queen and the most Christian king. See, sir, the peace in the King’s hands: if the duke of Ormond’s whole army consent* to

the suspension of arms, our first project proceeds; if they will not consent, the English troops will withdraw, and leave the foreigners to seek for their subsistence from the. States, who, very far from being able to furnish new expences, are not capable to support what they have already upon their hands. In abort, Britain retiring from the theatre of the war, and leaving it to those that are in no condition to make head against France, the peace may be concli/ded between the two crowns in a few weeks. These, sir, are the propositions which the queen commands me to make, and believes the king of France will- find his account at least as much the last way as the first. He once more desires him to send an express to the duke of Ormond, that he may know how to regulate his conduct; and if he signifies to him that the king has given orders to the governor of Dunkirk to admit the English, his grace will immediately do aU that he has said. He acquaints him further. That the queen was resolved to send the earl of Strafford immediately to the army.

Oh the same day Mr. St. John sends a copy of this letter to the duke of Ormond; and to shew his own opinion of this # extraordinary piece, in a postscript, he says, “ I need not caution your grace that the inclosed for M. de Torcy is fit to fall under the eye of no person whatsoever but your grace.”

As for his Instructions at this critical conjuncture, they are such as her majesty thought deserved sending the earl of Strafford on purpose to the army; and his grace is ordered to give Mareschal Villars an account of the endeavours the queen had used to subdue the obstinacy of those who refused to obey, and of his expectations to hear from him on an express sent to France; and a second time, according to what was said to M. de Torcy, his grace is ordered, if he receives an account from the court of France that her majesty's Last proposals are agreed to, and orders dispatched for the surrender of Dunkirk, without any more to do, to declare the suspension between* Great Britain and France, and to keep the whole body that shall obey his orders intire, and to withdraw in the best manner his circumstances will allow.

This offer was no sooner received in France, but, without the loss of one moment’s time accepted and consented to, as M. de Torcy acquaints Mr. St. John, July 5th, N. S. He takes care to mention very particularly aU the reasons and engagements which had been so plainly and explicitly proposed; and upon condition that the queen does immediately make a separate peace, keep no measures with her allies, but only leave them a time to submit to the conditions that shall be agreed upon for them between France and England, the king of France hath determined to send his orders to permit the English troops to enter into Dunkirk; and at the same time, a courier was dispatched'to Mareschal Villars to carry him these orders. And as a general cessation from all.

hostilities, both by land and sea, between the two nations, had been proposed1 by England till their treaties could he finished, the king of France with the same readiness agrees to that.

This account was ho sooner received in Eng- land, but fresh orders are sent to the duke of Ormond, as soon as he shall hear that the governor had received orders to evacuate Dunkirk, and to adbiit the queen's troops into tho place, without losing a moment, if he bad not already done it, to declared suspension of arms; and to withdraw all the English troops, and such others as would obey his orders: and lest any accident might still obstruct this project, hie grace by Mr. St. John is told, he must observe that the order is positive, and that no case can possibly happen in which her majesty will allow that any other measure should be taken; and Mr. St. John is much concerned that the earl of Strafford will arrive at the army later than was to be wished, from whom his grace was to receive those lights and informations for his guidance in this nice conjuncture, that he is anfply instructed to give him.

On the 12th July, N. S. Lord Strafford arrives in the camp; on the 14th, Prince Eugene sends the duke of Ormond word by an Aid de Camp, That he intended to march the next morning, with a design, as was supposed, to attack Landrecy. The duke of Qrmond is much surprised at the message, refuses to march with him, or to give him any assistance from the queen's troops, but Ids the prince know, that when he marched, his grace should be obliged to take the best care he could for the security of the queen's troops, and to change his camp in order to k.

On the same day Mareschal Villars, giving ‘ the duke of Ormond an accouqt <that be bad sent by colonel Lloyd orders for the delivery of Dunkirk, says, “ Permit me sir, to have the honour to tell you, though it be very advantageous not to be obligedi to engage the bravest and boldest of our enemies, yet it is-very important to know those that remain so; -and I' take the liberty to desire you will do me the honour to send roe word what troops and what generals will obey your orders, because'the first attempt the enemy makes, I will not lose one moment to meet them: The king gives me a liberty to fight, which nothing but the negotiation has hitherto prevented, and which the -army under my command has a great desire to make use of. I think the work is finished; if the army which is under your orders obeys them. This, thcn.sir, is no indiscreet curiosity, that I presume to desire you to give me some lights upon the doubts which I am in. I shall' be very much obliged to you, sir, if by the re-’turn of this trumpet' you will honour me with oue word of answer, : upon the lights which I have desired of you. You wilt give me leave to, join to this pacquet a letter from my lord Strafford.” On the 16th of July, the duke of Ormond, in answer to this letter, says, “ I should be glad I were at present in. a capacity to give you all tho insight you desire, but it ia

yet impossible for me. Notwithstanding I was unwilling, to delay sending back the trumpet, to let you know I am well assured I shall be capable, of telling you tomorrow, particularly what troops will remain under my command. As to the suspension of arms, you already anow, sir, that according’ to my orders I cannot declare it in fonn, till I am assured the governor of Dunkirk shall haye executed all the king's orders, for the evacuation of the place/' His grace adds, “ In the mean* time you will agree with me, sir, that the. said suspension has already its effect on my side, since I have just now informed prince Eugene and the States deputies, that in case they should undertake any new operation, 1 could not give them any assistance-with the queen’s army.”

On the 16th, the duke of Ormond writes aggin to Mareschal Villars, and says, “ Your trumpet just now put into my hands thehonour of your letter of the 15th» and I am new to acquit, myself of the promise I made you yesterday. Prince Eugene >9 marched this [morning, and all the Foreign troops have quitted us, exr cept one battalion and four squadrons of Holstein, and two squadrons of Walef.” He adds, “ Things having passed asT have the honour to tell you, I thought myself obliged to acquaint you of it as soon as possible, and as I observed to you yesterday, the suspension of arms hosal-ready its effect on my; part, by the separation I have made of the queen’s troops and all her artillery, from those of prince.Eugene; and by my declaring to him, I could give him no assistance, and that the payment of the foreign troops is stopped £ and that by consequence there is fallen upon the emperor and Holland a burthen they will4iot be long able to support: I trust, sir, to yeur good faith, and' soul tomorrow, make a movement, to put myself into another situation, and 1 hope T shall have news from Dunkirk, that will authorize me to de-dare the suspension of arms.

On the same day Mareschal Villare acquaints the duke of Ormond, that the governor of Dunkirk was making the necessary preparations to evacuate that place; he tells his graces “ For my part, sir, as I already reckon you for our ally, Iwranot at all in haste to have you further off; you are at your own liberty to come near ns, and encamp on the king’s territories, where-ever you shall think proper.” Upon thiotheduke of Ormond the day .after ordered a. cessation- of aims to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet;

Had the first design taken effect, which was depended upon by Franca, ! and so far presumed by England as- to be Undertaken; . for, that all the foreigners in the queen’s pay, that composed the duke of Ormond’S army, should separate and withdraw from the rest of the ames^ it is notorious, that from that instant prince Eugene’s whole army, unless they submitted to the sense measurer, bad been left at the mercy of the French army to be. cut in pieces, ov made prisoners at die will of Mares-chal Villars, which had left the queen’ *, troops

vilege of being last, destroyed; ye|; all the allies, whose honour and conscience would not permit them to abandon their confederates, and leave them as a sacrifice to France, wferu punished by England, with the loss of their, pay and subsidies, which was all, that was in the power, of, the ministry to do, to shew their resentment at this great, disappointment to the measures of France.

This march of prince Eugene lord Strafford, thought might bd, turned upon them; and he prevailed with the duke of Ormond, in a mes-sageto prince Eugene, to say, .“ His- marching, without concert with us, and all the queen’s auxiliaries marching from us, exposed us so, that we have been obliged to'send to the French to declare with ns a cessation of arms; nothing less could put the queen’s, troops in. safety; , for, though matters fell out so pot, without this, we must have declared for the oe&r. sation, .yet.why should we not turn all this mat *, ter upon them The Committee had not thought it, worth their while to take notice of such kan idle attempt to impose upon the senses ofmaukind, if they had not been induced, by another past* sage in the same letter, to think it deserved, some observation; where lord Strafford, giving an account of what passed upon the separation; says, all the English seem rejoiced to march off* being weary of the situation they were in, and; the reproaches they met with in the reat army; There are two or three face$ very sour; they sigh and wish the Hanoverians had not separated from us, but I shall tell them, perhaps, it may be better. He may see by this, time the wrong advice be has. followed, since; all must lay the blame of the separation, upon* him. But this is not the only instance^ of the* scorn and contempt which his lordship was. ready to express upon the like occasions.; fori July the 16th, 1712, giving an account of a conversation^with M.

The armies being now separated, and the suspension of arms declared, your Committee think it; necessary1 to recapitulate, in what .manner, and by. whaesteps, this fatal cessation \yas procured.

That it was infinite advantage and: absolutely necessary, tothe affairs of France, and therefore insisted on by France, is very evir dent; and it is as, certain, than the English ministry gave, early. into it, if they were not the first advisers of it: for which.no- ocher account need, bo required, but that as all their measures, tended to advance the interest of the queen’s enemies, they could: not fail to-be zealous, in a point which contributed more to those, views than any one occurrences duping the. whole negotiation; but as they all along wanted appearances, and consulted them, more than any real advantages to the kingdom, %they thought it necessary to annex some conditions to this important article, that might pass upon the deluded people as a justification of this unprecedented treachery..

• The Demolition of Dunkirk was. always, so popular a point, that nothing- could strike, the imaginations of the people more, than to be told that this important place was delivered, into the queen’s possession.:. This step, they thought, well improved, would recommend the peace itself* at> least justify the cessation. And as the nation had nothing more at heart, than the disposition of the Spanish monarchy after the renunciation had been industriously cried up, and the queen had declared from the throne, that France and Spain were thereby more effectually divided than ever, these two articles were made the essential conditions of granting a. cessation of arms: For the latter, France easily consented to it, having declared it to be null and« void by the fundamental) laws of France: For the first it » evident how unwillingly France was brought to surrender Dun* kirk, but thisthe ministry were resolved to purchase at aoy rate, as what would most easily amuse, and' sensibly affect, the nation; and therefore-to obtain this, they engaged not only to grant a cessation <of arms, but to- conclude a separate peace.

The prospect of concluding a separate peace, and the obtaining immediately a cessation of arms, which answered all the- purpose* of France, almost as well as a separate peace*' by leaving the whole confederacy in their power, and at their.mercy, were so great temptations, to France, that the surrender of Dunkirk is ~ agreed to; but, if we come to consider what England gained by granting this fetal cessation, we shall find the demolition of Dunkirk supplied by a new eanal more beneficial to France, and formidable to tile navigation of Great Britain, than Dunkirk ever was; and for the renunciation, we were told- by France, we should'deceive ourselves if we accepted- it as an expedient to prevent the union of the two monarchies.

Your Committee’ cannot close their Ohser-uatfoa* upon this memorable campaign 17 13,

without inserting another letter tha*was- wrote by tbs duke of Ormond to my lordBolinhroke. .The Dutch it seems, encouraged by the success of their enterprise upon fort Knocque, had formedi a. design, for surprising Newport on Fumes, .which> ms grace-having intelligence of thought1, peeper to1 write, the following letter, October the 21st, 1712, to my lord Bolinbroke, ,

“ 1 take this opportunity of an express . which brought me some letters this mooning ! from Ostendv and is returning thither, to. acquaint your lordship with an- affdir which has l^eo <fommunicated!to ine.by a person who is very well .inclined to tier majesty’s service j your lordship will best judge of the importance; of it, and the use that is to be made of it,

; when 1 tali you, that the success of. the eaten-| price upon Knocque, has. encouraged the forming a project for surprising Nieuport or Fumes,

; and that the fortifying Dixmudev i* mads use ! of as a.pretence for drawing together a. body of | troops sufficient tor put the design in execution;

I if it be-thought mors for her majesty's, service j to, prevent it, 1 am humbly of opinion some; means should be found to give advice of it to the marshal Villars, who may possibly think we owe him that good office, in requital of some | informations your lordship know she has given } me, with a design to serve her majesty and the | nation: I am not yet at liberty to acquaint ! your lordship with the name of my author, who desires the whole matter may be managed with the greatest secrecy, which is a caution I know I need-only mention to your lordship.

. The great step of the cessation was no sooner taken, the suspension declared, and Dunkirk delivered up, but M. de Torcy calls upon Mr. St. John-, to perform his promise of concluding- k peace between France and - Great Britain in a few weeks, which he thinks j can meet with no difficulties, all the conditions of peace with England being regulated, and j the intentions of the king, touching the gene-; ral peace, known to, and be thinks he may say approved by, her Britannic majesty. M. de Toroy then proposes the method of regulating the suspension by sea, and insists, that during the suspension, either general or particular, the transportation of neither troops, ammunition, nor provisions, shall be allowed into ' . Portugal, Catalonia, or any other place where; the war continue* -Pncquet boats between | Dover and Calais are to be immediately set-tied; far the general ease of correspondence; and the suspension of arms to be published in,

; Portugal and Catalonia, without waiting till it | shall be settled at Utrecht, i All these proposals from FVaace are very j readily assented to; and Mr. St, John thinks; the queen ia a condition, not to lose- a njo-| raent’s time in concluding with the ministers of -| France, the convention for a general suspension jof arm *, both bysea and land, aad even the. j treaty of peace between- Great Britain aad France.

duke of Savoy; u Of all the allies, ’^ says he, 4t there is noue whose interest the queen has so much at heart, as the duke of Savoy’s; He hopes the most Christian king will act in concert with her' majesty, and omit nothing that may engage his royal highness to come into all our measures, and that may protect him from the insults of the imperialists for so doing; and among other advantages proposed for him, he lays it down as a principle, that it is neither for the interest Of Great Britain nor France, that the kingdom of Sicily should be given . to the house of Austria, ana therefore demands it for the duke of Savoy, and declares thp queen will not desist from this demand.”

This concfirn of the British ministers for the duke of Savoy, who is represented as the ally whose interest the queen bath most at heart, yonr Committee is at a loss to account for. The French, as appears by a letter of the bishop of Bristol, to Mr. St. John, of the 26th April 1712, had actually offered Sicily to the emperor. The duke, of Savoy himself did not re- lish this proposition, as.appears by lord Peterborough’s letter to Mr. St. John of the 24th Sept. 1712, in which his lordship represents the duke of Savoy, expressing, that he was not so vainly impatient of the title of king, as to lose or hazard any real interest, for an empty name: but that he thought it much more extraordinary, that a prince beaten ten years together by his enemies, should remain at last with the prize so contended for, and which so often by parliament had been declared the just and unavoidable motive of the war: Again in lord Peterborough’s letter of Nov. 16th, 1712, to Mr. St. John, he affirmed, that nothing can represent the uneasiness of mind of the auke of Savoy, after these offers had been made him; To calm this uneasiness, and to fix his royal highness in the measures of the ministry, it was necessary that lord Peterborough should, in a memorial given to him, represent, that his royal highness in refusing these offers must fail out with the queen, and the English ministers, whom his lordship endeavours to ^excuse from the reproaches cast directly upon them, as if they were persons devoted to France. That for the support of What was proposed, a sufficient fleet should be furnished either by England or France, or by both powers jointly; and that his royal highness should be guaranteed and protected against any power that should oppose this project, or should insnlt him for having accepted these offers. The arguments of the English ministers did at length prevail with his royal highness; and if the view of the said ministers was effectually to disable the emperor from supporting himself against France after our separation, by forcing into the interest of France an ally so considerable as the duke of Savoy, it must be confessed these measures were extremely well calculated for such an end; but it does not appear to your Committee how England came to be so far concerned in this matter as to offer its guarantee for Sicily, which na-

turally must have engaged us in a war against the emperor. This forwardness of the ministry in offering to make England guarantee for con* ditions advantageous-only to France, seems the more extraordinary, when they observe, that, during the whole course of this negotiation, they find no endeavours used to procure a1 guarantee of our confederates to secure the protestant succession, which bad been addressed for by both Houses of Parliamentnor do they observe, that the king of Sicily, for whom so much was done, was ever requested to be guarantee for the said succession.

The dreadful consequences of the separation of the armies were now sensibly felt in the unfortunate action at Denain, where Mareschal Villars on the 24th of July, N. S. attacked lord: Albemarle’s camp, which - lie forced, took him prisoner, and entirely defeated all the troops under his command: M. de Torcy immediately sends an account to Mr. St* John of this agree-1 able news, and says, “ The king of France is persuaded, that the advantage, which his troops' have obtained, will give the queen so much the more pleasure, as it may be a new motive to overcome the obstinacy of the enemies to peace.”

Your Committee could not with patience .read a letter from a minister of France, declaring to the secretary of state of England, that a victory obtained by the queen’s enemies over her good allies, must be a pleasure or satisfaction to her majesty. But at that time the French thought themselves so sure of the British ministry, that they depend upon their1 assistance to push this advantage against the confederates still further; and M. de Torcy says, he hopes the queen will effectually bring them to reason, in agreeing immediately with the king, the last measures that are to be taken -for finishing this work> She has the means in her own hands, if she will make use of Ghent and Bruges, which her troops possess, and especially of Ghent; for it depends upon whosoever is roaster of that place, to make all the designs of the enemy’s generals miscarry, and to give law to the Dutch.

Neither was M. de Torcy singular in his opinion about the action atDenam; Mareschal Villars would not lose a moment in giving the-duke of Ormond an account of this news: he ascribes die victory to the separation of the brave English, and insults the allies as common enemies, that must now be sensible what wrong measures they had taken:in this manner, and to this effect, Mareschal Villars thinks proper -tp write to the duke of Ormond; and at the same time the Mareschal desires his grace to. transmit this account to the French plenipotentiaries at Utrecht, and to make a thousand compliments from him to lord Strafford.

Aqd that there might be no part of the world where it was in the power of the English - mi- -nistry to assist their new friends the French, at the expence of their. old allies, M. de Torcy. further proposes, that the queen should pot a stop to count Staremberg’s projects in Catalonia,

by sending orders to her troops in Terragona, not to let the Germans intp that place; and not content with beingsaided and < assisted all that was possible by land, he farther desires that express orders might be sent (and through France os the shortest way) to the English men of war that were then cruising in the Mediterranean, to suffer the French ships, that were then returning from the Levant, to pass unmolested; which was no sooner asked thau complied with.

But the taking possession of Ghent and Bruges was not only the desire of M. de Torcy, but was supported by the advice of the earl of Strafford; who in his letter to Mr. St. John of the lfrth of July, 1712, says, M I am for having the duke of Ormond send some party on purpose to march through some Of their towns, to see whether or no they would, refuse them passage; if they did, that might authorize us the more to do a thing very agreeable to the queen's troops, and what I believe you would approve of” His lordship adds, “ He (meaning the duke of Ormond) is very hearty in every .thing, but really is under difficulties with those about him; those that are able are not yet entirely to be relied upon; and those that might be trusted, are not capable of giving advice.”

. And that there might be no doubt of his lordship's meaning in what he had before advised, July th.e 21st, he tells Mr. St. John, uThe measures I mentioned would not be disagreeable to you, was that of inarching to Ghent, which we have now so well executed that we are within two days march of it, and the English are intire masters of the citadel, as likewise of all the gates of the town; and have orders to he upon their guard, not to let themselves be surprised by two battalions, one of Dutch and. one of Walloons in the town, nor any troops sent from any othe* place. . This is a coup de parti for the States who did not expect it, else they /would not have, behaved themselves with the hauteur they lately did; the thing was so well and secretly managed, that all preparations were made to march about to^ Warneton between Lisle and Ipres, to have lived upon the French country and till we had marched a day’s march on this side the Scarp, the Dutch and their friends did , i\ot perceive our design, which, as soon as they did, their surprise and uneasiness were equally great.”

The duke of Ormond having given an account of his marching his army towards Ghent, and Bruges, lord Bolingbroke commends his conduct, and tells him the methods he had pursued were so well adapted to the present conjuncture of affairs, that they answer in every point what they would have wished: that the news of Dunkirk could not have been followed by any more agreeable, than that of his grace’s having directed his march towards Ghent.

And on the 22d of July, O. S. his lordship tells his. grace, That taking possession of Ghent and Bruges bad improved her majesty’s views,

[xlfi

which he is ordered to secure in the best manner he was able, and doubts not but it will have a good effect upon the conduct of the allies.

On the 17th of July, O. S. in a letter to

M. dc Torcy, lord Bolingbroke recapitulates, what he said before concerning the duke of Savoy; and as a farther motive to induce France to comply with his demands, he represents that it will be very important to have his concurrence both in the suspension of arms, and the treaty of peace, which in all probability will be made between Britain, France, and Spain, without the intervention of the ' other allies; and that Savoy's declaring for us will be a decisive stroke, and the more necessary because the king of Prussia’s conduct haff not answered the queen’s expectations.

Before this letter was dispatched, 'the lord . Bolingbroke receives M. de Torcy’s of the 26th

N. S. In answer to which, July the. 18th, O. S. he insists further in behalf of the duke of Savoy,

“ tells him with great satisfaction, That the duke of Ormond was possessed of Ghent and Bruges, and had orders to be upon his guard and secure those posts; and a9 the queen embraced with a great deal of. satisfaction every opportunity that offered to do the king a pleasure; positive orders are sent to admiral Jennings to suffer the French ships coming from 'the Levant to pass freely.”

It is almost incredible that the English ministry, however determined they were to give up the honour of the queen, and interest of their country, in following the dictates of France should venture to do it in this open manner. All that had been hitherto declared, was a suspension of arms in Flanders, and that our troops were to act no longer against France:but here by the advice of the earl of. Strafford at the desire of M. de Torcy, they are to keep possession of Ghent and Bruges, in order to disappoint the designs of the enemies of France and the allies of the queen; and although the suspension of arms extended as yet no further than to the two armies in Flanders, and tho general suspension by sea and land was not signed till the 19th of August, N. S. lord Bolingbroke, on the 18th of July, O. S. declares he had then sent very positive orders to the queen’s admiral not to intercept the French fleet coming from the Levant.

These constant compliances in the English ministry encouraged M. de Torcy to believe they would now stick at nothing that could be proposed. He presses again the'concluding the separate peace between England and France as what they both agreed in to be the most effectual way to make the rest of the allies comply. He desires that the troops In Flanders under the command of the duke of Ormond, may be left there to make a'good use of the towns which he was in possession of; but as the king of France could not consent to the duke of Savoy’s lmvingSicily, except the elector of Bavaria has also the Netherlands besides his electorate, he thinks the queen’s having %

a

jcItK] APPENDiX.--R^»r* ftlmtg to ikt [aflviii

good army fa Flanders-under the command of the duke of Ormond, natty render this vtt prectibbe; and as the queen has done a great ' deal for her own ungrateful allies, it will be for her glory new to oohtrftmte to the good of a trinoe of so much merit as the elector of Bavaria, whose acknowledgments will be equal to the* benefits he shall receive.

But this would notepads even upon the ministry of Great Britain:the giving Flanders to the elector of Bavaria, was not only contrary to all the propositions of peace that had been made and passed between England and France, but was what would absolutely engage os in a new war to oblige the Imperialists and Dutch to agree to it; and theycould not think it For the honour or interest of the queen to to'make war upon her allies, as ungrateful as they had been, in favour of the elector of Ba-vaiia; and especially'considering, that although we could secure Gliertt and Bruges for him, the allies had yet an'army in Flanders so considerable both for the number and goodness of their troops, that they were able to defend the conquest they had made. And to give him Sicily, which was likewise demanded, lord Bolingbroke hopes it will not1 be insisted On, because it might be the occasion of continual jealousies; it might in particular be the squit* of disputes and quarrels betwixt England and France, whose strict anion and indissoluble friendship were the points, in view to which all pur measures had been. directed for so long a tithe. The queen’s ministers think when the king of France has made all reasonable efforts for his allies, he must do something for the love of peace, and that a particular interest should yield to the general. M You cannot, ” says my lord Bolingbroke, “ but feel the force of this argument, because you are not at all ignorant that this negociation was begun and carried on, upon a supposition, that the queen must desist - from marry conditions, which in rigour Bhe was obliged to procure for her allies.* He very strongly urges the necessity of concluding immediately the peace-between England, France, and Spain; hat absolutely insists upon Sicily for the duke of Savoy.

' But although this negociation was carried on' upon a supposition, that the queen was to depart from several things, which injustice ought to have been procured for her allies, the king of France thought hirhaelf under no such obligation; his honour to an ally, whose fidelity was without Teproach, was not to be dispensed with and therefore to satisfy his engagements to so good an ally, was a point from which the king of France would never depart. But to shew the king’s good dispositions to the peace, he at last consents to the duke of Savoy’s having Sicily upon certain conditions; Wherein very ample provision is made for satisfaction to the •lector of'Bavaria; and one express condition: is, that a peace be concluded between England, j France, Spain, and Savoy. j

In answer to this letter, lord Bolingbroke ac-! quaint* M. do Torcy, that he had received the;

queen's orders to go immediately to France, and be hoped, under the auspices of the abbot Gadltibr, in a’weeks time to saiute him at Fon-taiirbleaa.

Whilst these great points were transacting, and carrying on directly betwixt France and England, it is not' to be supposed, that any thing very material passed, at Utrecht; some few passages only concerning such communications as were thought necessary to be made to keep up the form of a negociation, may not be improperly-taken notice of.

The advice of the duke of Ormond’s orders to engage in neither siege of battle, gave great alarm; the States desire the British ministers to give them some satisfaction concerning tt matter, wherein they thought religion, liberty1, and all that is valuable, was so nearly concerned:to which they could obtain nothing but very general answers. Upon which they expressing their discontent to he kept iutirely in the dark, without the least knowledge of what was done, or intended to be done, the bishop took that opportunity to put an end to tlreir curiosity, by executing the orders before mentioned, that the queen thought herself now Under no obligations whatsoever to the States.

This declaration is grounded upon the behaviour of the States; but it must be remembered, that this order is dated very few days after the orders to the duke Of Ormond not to engage in siege or battle. And in the same letter the bishop Of Bristol, giving an account of a conference between his lordship and Mr. Consbruck, the emperor’s minister, the bishop' says, he was very desirous to know, and I was as unable to inform him, Of the particulars wherein the-care of the emperor’s interest did consist.

The Dutch did likewise send an express to their minister at London, with a long aiid most moving letter to the queen, to remonstrate against this proceeding. (No. 36.) but he could obtain no answer at afi; Mr. St. John thought, the queen intending that week today before the parliament the plan of the peace, the proceedings of the two Houses on that occasion would be a more’seasonable, as well as a more decisive answer to the States, than any he could return.

' The queen having.comraunicated to the parliament how for the French are already come, in their proposals for settling a general peace, the bishop of Bristol is directed to discourse with the ministers of the several allies, as soon as possible, agreeable to the plan contained in her majesty’s speech; but before his lordship makes this step, Mr. St. John tells him, it will be proper that he speaks first with the French plenipotentiaries upon this subject, and inquire of them whether they will be willing, and in what manner they will be willing to give this communication to the allies: but the bishop of Bristol gives an account on the 28th of June

N. S. that the French plenipotentiaries declared they had mo such orders, and without themfthey could notdo it; and the bishop find-

* i«l

ing it might be of some service, and that it was looked upon at the Hague as a step that might facilitate the suspension of hostilities, his lordship did again press the French ministers to know, whether they were willingto declare in a solemn conference, that the particulars declared in the queen's speech are the king their master's offers to the allies, and that he will make them good in the negotiation. The French again refused to make any such declaration; and in this opinion they persisted even after the Dutch ministers consented to accept the contents of her majesty's speech ma-terid tractandi, if the French would at the same time acknowledge them to be their master's offers, and negociate upon them in order to make them good. But the French plenipotentiaries were so far from agreeing to this, that they demanded of our ministers to know the queen's mind upon the several parts of the last 'general plan bfought over by M. Gaultier, and . which are not explained in her majesty's speech; saying their king expected it: and they do not know how to'proceed till those points be stated:and the utmost they wqre to be brought to, was, that it was not to be understood to exclude their master from making some demands for the elector of Bavaria, and that Lisle was to be restored over and above the two or three places excepted in the queen's speech. These passages are here mentioned as falling in, in point of time, but will be more properly considered afterwards.

At the^same time that Mr. St. John commufticatea the queen's speech to the bishop of Bristol, he orders him to let the Dutch ministers know, that the queen thinks a Suspension of arms, at least in the Netherlands, to be absolutely necessary. And here your Committee must observe, that these orders to propose to the States a suspension, are dated June 11th

O. S. which was the very day the articles for a suspension were signed by M. de Torcy, and ha^ been signed by lord Bolingbroke five days before.

In several letters that followed from the bishop of Bristol, he gives an account of the general dissatisfaction of all, the allies, and tire inexpressible consternation they were all in, that they represented our proceedings as the . unavoidable rain of Europe: religion, liberty, , the faith of treaties, are urged to shew the enormity of our usage:his lordship does not know what he may expect from the unmeasurable rage of the people, nor where it will end; that the Dutch seem to be uneasy on no account so tuuch, as that they cannot come to the knowledge of what is to be their lot: their concern is chiefly, that they cannot know the particulars of what is designed for them, especially what* species are to be excepted out of the Tariff of 1664, and what towns oat of the Barrier. On which occasion the bishop of Bristol did, as with the greatest^ truth, assure them; that he knew nothing either of the one,

* or the other.

But the reception that these representations

youvii.

D

met seems to your committee as unaccountable as any thing that happened:Mr. $t. John, June 20th, O. S. says, .“'They are not surprised at the clamours and rage of the Dutch, which they foresaw and were prepared Tor: it ia

certain we run great hazards, but it is at certain their unaccountable folly is the occasion of it; he cannot imagine the bishop should be in any danger:his character is sacred in a double manner: and besides I have reason to think, that though they kick and flounce liko wild beasts caught in a toil, yet the cords are too strong for them to b/eak; they will soon tire with struggling, and when they are tired grow tame." -This is the treatment and language which the queen’s secretary thinks.fit to bestow upon her allies; Their desiring to have some satisfaction in what most nearly concerned them is called an unaccountable folly, that had drawn all these mischiefs upon them; and if any resentment is shown, they are wild beasts; but the cords of the toils which England and France bad caught them in, were too strong for them to break. But lord Strafford is not content with hai-d words only, he is glad that orders were given to stop the pay of the foreigners, of which they complain horribly, but it will make them humble and sharp: handling does better with these people, than the best words.

On the 24th of June, O. S. Mr. St. John writes a long letter to lord privy seal, and instructs him to lay the intire blame of all that has happened, upon the Dutch; and that tho want of concert is only to be imputed to those who are at the head of affairs in Holland; however that her majesty is still ready, for their sakes, and for the sake of the common interest of Europe, to forget all that is past, and to join with them in the strictest terms of amity and confidence. This farce was still to be carried 'on in Holland, and these professions made in the name of the queen, when it is notorious, that four days before, on June the 20th, O. S. Mr. St. John had in the strongest terms promised in the queen’s name to M.de Torcy, to conclude a separate peace with Franee on condition Dunkirk was delivered to the English; and that this offer of a separate peace made by England, arose from the French’s refusing to deliver Duhkirk upon the conditions first agreed upon, although at the same time the queen's plenipotentiaries are directed in a most public manner to lay the blame of all our measures at the door of the States General.

' But whatever measures were carrying on elsewhere, and although in all the letters that passed upon that subject between lord Bolingbroke and M. de Torcy, the concluding a se-

£arate peace is treated as a thing Settled on oth sides; the plenipotentiaries at Utrecht are ordered to proceed upon another foot; and in a letter from lord Bolingbroke of July the 16th, 0.8. to the plenipotentiaries jointly, upon .a supposition, that lord Strafford was then got back again to Utrecht, they are ordered to (D)

tbse ho -tittieirt' settling the eonreiitfM for a suspension Of arms- between Great Britain and France* both by sea and land, and' when that is brought to perfection, to call upon the allies to enter again upon the negociatioiw on the foundation of the plan laid down in the queen’s speech; and it is desired their lordships will appear, solicitous in this matter, and affect to be the aggressors, and to press the allies to give in categorical answers. By this meant the tregociations were seemingly set on foot again; and whether the allies did or did -not comply, our ministry were ready to make their use of it cither way: if they did comply, the scandal of a separate peace would be avoided; If they did hot, the blame was to be imputed to their obstinacy. i

The treaty being' left upon this foot at Utrecht with a possibility of being carried on or dropt, as shduld be found convenient; and the king of France having, as was before observed by M. de TorcyV letter of August the 4th, N. 8. consented to the demands made by England on behalf of the duke of-$avoy, hut among others upon these two express conditions, than a suspension of arms both by sea and land be imme- diately granted, and that a separate peace between England, France, Spain, and Savoy, be forthwith concluded, it is thought proper and necessary, that lord Bolingbroke should go himself to France, finally to adjust and settle the great points in dispute.

His powers and instructions are hereunto annexed, No. 85.

The substance of his instructions was in short to remove all difficulties and differences that might obstruct the general suspension of arms between England and France from taking place, or settling the treaty of peace in such a course, as may bring it to a happy and speedy conclusion. But to declare, that he does not imagine there will be any possibility to prevail with the queen to sign the peace with France and Spain, Unless full satisfaction he given to his royal highness the duke of Savoy, and-unless they -can take him along with them in the doing thereof. He is therefore to take particular care to settle his barrier, and to procure Sicily for him; to settle the renunciation in sUcb a manner, that there may be as little room lef^ aS possible for dispute ordelay; that the elector -ofBavaria may have Sardinia, and be restored to his dominions in the empire, except the Upper Palatiqate and the first electorate; and when he has had satisfaction in these points, he is to proceed to speak to such articles as relate particularly to die interest of Great Britain, and endeavour to have such of them, a* there may appear to be any doubt concerning, explained in (he most advantageous manner. And :then he is to do hi9 best to discover upon the several parts of the general plan of peace, what; the'real ultimatum of France may be; and when the peace between England and France shall besigned* that it may be expedient to fix the allies a time to come in, wherein the queen will nee her g^od-offices, hat will not he under

any obligation to impose; upon the allies thf scheme offered- by France, or to debar them from obtaining better terras for themselves. . *

-- By these instructions it appears, that lord Bolingbroke was impowered to conclude a separate peace with England, France, Spain, and Savoy; that at this time there was some doubt concerning several-articles relating to the particular interests of Great Britain, which be was to endeavour to get explained; but no instruction, if hisendeavours prove ineffectual in behalf of Great Britain; not to. conclude the treaty, which in these very instructions, is expressly provided for in favour of Savoy, and his lordship is ordered to do his best to discover the ultimatum of France, which hitherto it seems the ministry were ignorant of; but whether France condescended so far or not, .as to let his lordship into - the secret, our treaty was -to be concluded; and the ministry seem to think, they had sufficiently discharged, their duty, in declining to be engaged to iropofe what terms France should think proper upon the allies, those allies to whom the queen was bound, by the faith of treaties, and all: the most solemn engagements and public declaj-/aliens, to procure adjust and reasonable-satisfaction, according to their several alliances. But now it seems sufficient that we did not debar them from the liberty of endeavouring to obtain still better terms for themselves.

With these . instructions, lord Bolingbroke goes to France, and for his proceedings the Committee refers to Iris lordship's own account in his letter to the earl of Dartmouth, August 32nd, N. S. 1712, (No. 37.) and without entering at present into any further particulars, the convention for a general suspension of arms between .Great Britain and. France for foitr v months were signed at Paris by lord Boling-, broke and M. de Torcy, August 22nd, , N. S. 1712, as his lordship says, but dated August 19th, N.S.(No.29.)

France was now become intire master, of aU future negotiations, and / did not fail to make use of the power that was put idto their hands; an early instance will be seen of this in the affair of Totumay: But being now comeback to Utrecht, it wiU he necessary to mention an incident that happened there, the dispute.between count Rechteren and M. Mesoager; -which is taken notice of only as a pretence that was made use of by the French* to keep the negotiation in suspense as Ipng .gait served their purpose; ana in this England concurred* as will appear afterwards.

On the 30th of August, the British plenipotentiaries acquaint lord Bolingbroke, that, in some discourse with the ministers of the allies* they had carried matters so farms to.tell them, that though her majesty will endeavour |o promote their interest in a peace, and obtain for them the best terms that shall he possible; yet if th.ose endeavours. should- not procure more than the contents of .her majesty's speech, or even in some degree full short of jap, the. fault vfiU he iotirely theirs, who -have -iua-

Hit]

dered things difficult and uncertain, which otherwise would have been easyand practicable: And having thus far complied, with their late Orders to lay all the blame upon the allies, they farther inform his lordship, that they had howererobtained the consent of the ministers of the allies to come to a conference with those of France, ' in order Co renew the negotiations; the time to be fixed between" the British and French plenipotentiaries; who, meeting to have some discourse previous to the general conferences, parted without coming to any conclusion. *

The occasion of their difference, that prevented renewing the conferences, arose upon proposals made by the British ministers in relation to Toumay. Their lordships in their Letter of the 2d of September, N. S. to lord JBolingbroke stale the casein this manner.

In her majesty’s speech it js expressed, That the Dutch are to have the intire barrier, as demanded in 1709, except two or three places at most.

' The French ministers insist, that they must have Lisle as an equivalent for Dunkirk, and that the same is not to be understood as one of the three places mentioned in the speech, and Consequently that they must, in all, hpve four of the places mentioned in thedemandsof 1709.

' This to us appears to be altogether inconsistent with what her majesty has declared; and we accordingly think it contrary to our duty t6 bring on a conference, in which suehan explication is to be made.

The French ministers on the other hand have Shewed us their orders, which positively require them to insist upon the restitution of Toumay, its well as Lisle; and that they can by no means consent to the cession of Maubenge or Cottdd.

The British ministers then pressed the French to speak at first in terms as general, as their proposal was conceived in; but the French thought it necessary to be particular and express in that point above all others, because they shall otherwise have tied themselves up, and given the Dutch an advantage.

The result of this debate was not to proceed to a conference till this point be determined; the French insisting, that their orders were so plain as neither to need or admit any explication, and the British ministers thinking the matter a* plain on their side.

They hope their zeal for her majesty’s honour will be graciously approved, and desire to be directed what further they are to do in this matter, which they apprehend to be of a decisive consequence; because they find even those among the Dutch, who appear to be most cordially disposed to such a peace, as may reestablish a good harmony between her majesty and the states, as absolutely necessary for their mntaafpresenration, fally resolved, either to tretahn Toumay and have Condd yielded to them, or to take ene of these - two courses, dither to come into any terms that France efiert, or to continue the war at all boards.

[tit

In the same letter our plenipotentiaries give an account, that the French ministers, by au order front their master, did insist, ' that the States General should in a public manner disavow count Rechieren for the affront done to M. Mesnager, and then, remove him from the congress, and this satisfaction to precede, any further negotiation.

The lanjpjftge which our plenipotentiaries had used to the allies is very much approved by lord Bolingbroke, who says, they bad spoke the sentiments of the queen’s heart in what they declared the 30th of August, N. S. and that if the allies did fall short of the plan laid down in the queen’s speech, the fault wap in.-tirely their own. < His lordship says, Sure it is, that this plan was nothing more than the ultimatum of what France would offer; hut he . wished that the imperial and Dutch policy had not rendered it the ultimatum, of what France will grant. The same general reflection may be applied to the particular case mentioned in your lordship’s last letter. France would have yielded Toumay, though much against the grain. If France has now any advantage, mid refuses flatly to yield what she only begged to have restored, the fault is iptirely theirs.

But the dispatch of the plenipotentiaries of the 2d of September, relating to Toumay, haying not yet been considered by the lords of the council, his lordship could not give any positive instructions about it till the next opportunity, but in the mean time recommends to them two considerations; that the keeping of the Dutch in hopes of her majesty’s good offices, will prevent them from taking any. desperate resolution; and the French insisting to have count Rechteren disavowed before any further treaty, will put off for some time the decision o/ that great point.

Lord Strafford in the mean time, by his letters of the 13th and lfith of September N. S. represented the, States .as mightily sunk with their misfortunes, and not knowing wed what measures to take; but that they insisted upon Toumay, as so essential to their barrier, that they actually had none, without it; and his lordship is so much of that opinion* that he wishes they might have Toumay, though'they were forced to truck Ipres for i$; .that if he, could positively assure them they should have Toumay, he believed they would submit, to the plan of the queen’s speech.

This opinion of his lordship’s is not very easily to be reconciled to what he afterwards wrote to Mr. Prior, upon this subject, October the 4th, 1712. “ If we bad a mjnd to have Nick. Frog sign with us, we might; for he is ready to do it for Toumay which, if we sign together, we cannot welj refuse him:hut 1 expect you will cut that matter short; and I long to hear from you ”

But this affair of Tournay was not -so soon settled here, although the difficulty does not seem to be, whether the French or Dutch were to have it, but: in what manner it was to h* procured for France, without a manifest con-

UJ; APPENDIX. — -import relating to the [hi

tradition to vAatwas said by. the queen in tier speech cencernin^the barrier.

' Lord Boiingbioke, Sept. 10th; O. S. writes three letters upon this subject to M. de Torcy, to Mr. Priory end to. the plenipotentiaries, which being upon an affair of this nicety, are all annexed, (No. S3, 32, 31.)

In the letter to M. de Torcy, Lord Bolingbroke desires him to remember the proposition vthich was often laid down by him when in -Franc *, and insisted upon as a fundamental in at) their ftttrre proceedings upon the general peace; that the cond uot of the queen, in regard to the interests of her allies, was in a great measure determined by their behaviour; that the violent measures, which they had taken to' obstruct the peace, had put the qoeen in a condition to make her peace without waiting for their concurrence, in which case the queen Would declare that she had signed the treaty With France and Spain, and would propose the plan brought over by Abbot Gaultier, and delivered the 29th of April, (1712, for the1allies to treat upon, and could do no more than by her good offices, as a common friend to both parties. But in case the Dutch in particular, or the other allies, should, before the conclusion of her peace with France, enter into concert with her majesty, we should have more measures to keep with them; the compassion of oar people Would be moved in their behalf, and the queen’s ministers be obliged to make some steps, which otherwise they would absolutely refuse to do. Upon this' foundation, says lord. Bolingbroke, the king's ministers seem to exact Something more; when they insist the queen's ministers ahould propose thejudding a conference, in which the first proposition started would appear m some‘measure contrary to what the queen said in her speech, touching the barrier of the States.- The point in dispute between your plenipotentiaries and ours is not to know, whether ToufnSy shall be restored to the king, or not. For to obtain that* place, it is not necessary that you should begin by making this specific declaration; but the question is, whether the queen Ought formally, and at present, to declare that Tournay shall be restored to France? Which would he to consent to the explanation which your ministers give to this article of the queen's speech. He then says, Wot to swell my letter too much, which may already seem tedious, I refer myself to what Mr. Prior shall' have the honour to explain to you - Upon this point; and I shall content myself with saying, that as it is not difficult to find a temperament, I hope we shall' avoid all things that may occasion a dispute between the ministers of Great Britain and France.

u This temperament is to be found in his lordship's letter to Mr. Prior, of the same day, which his lordship says, is to be looked upon cntyaf* a shelter from Harry to Mat. and not the secretary to the minister. He sends him inclosed an extract of his letter to M. do Torcy, which, he says, relates to a matter that has ften ford treasurer and himsetf aoefaudl trou-

ble in cabinet; he likewise sends him a copy of the plenipotentiaries dispatch of the 3d of September, upon the same subject; wherein, as be will observe, their lordships are very warm about the dispute. He can assure him, we have those here, who are not a Jot cooler* His lordship goes on; the solution of this difficulty must come from yen, which is a matter of management and appearance, more than of substance.

“ The method of doing it is by making M. de Torcy sensible of the proposition settled between them in France, That the queen can never do any thing which shall look like a direct restraint on her allies from demanding what they judge necessary; but as long as they act the part which they now do, she can very justly be passive, and neuter, as to their interests. This his lordship thinks is advantage enough for France, and such a one, fairly speaking, as a year ago they would have given more than Tournay to be sure of. They must nut, therefore, press us-to go further than this, nor to do any thing which may seem contradictory to what the queen delivered from the throne.

. “ In a word, the use which the French will make of the unaccountable obstinacy of the Dutch, and the other allies, may in several respects, and particularlyj for aught I know, in the.instance of Tournay, give them an opportunity of saving and gaining more than they could have hoped for; and the queen may in. the present circumstances contribute passively to this end, but actively she never can iu any circumstances."

His lordship then very plainly gives his advice how this matter is to be managed, in these words; I think in my own opinion, and I believe I speak the queen's upon this occasion, it were better the French should in the course of the treaty declare, that whatever they intended to have given the Dutch when die qu^en. spoke from the throne, their conduit has been such, and the situation of affairs is so -altered, that the king is resolved to have Tournay restored to him:I say, I believe this were bettor thah to expect that we should assent to an exposition of theqneen's words, by which her majesty would yield the town up; let the conferences begin as soon as they will, I dare say business will not very speedily be dispatched in them: We shall go on to ripen every thing for a, conclusion between us and Savoy, and France and Spain; and this is the true point of view which the French ought to have before their eyes."

The scheme being concerted here, and transmitted to France, lord fiolittgbrake on the same day writes to the plenipotentiaries, in answer, to theirs of"thegnd of 'Sept, N» S. upon which he had before told them, He could give no instructions tiff their letter, was-considered by the lords of the council; neither does his lordship now send them any directions, but enlarged upon the same general topics of imputing aU the mischiefs that had happened, and in jpaitwulac tins affair of Tonmay# teihc«h-

stinacy of the allies. -His lordship observes,

“ That in the plan brought over by abbot Gaultier, the king of France begged for Tour* nay rather than insisted upon it, but was now encouraged to, refuse what he only endeavoured to save; and in short that France had j»ow gathered strength by our divisions, and was grown sanguine enough to make that plan the ultimatum, of her concessions, which was at first nothing more than the ultimatum of her offers; but that the Dutch had nobody to blame for all this hut themselves." His lordship adds,

“ Her majesty is very sensible of the concern you express for her honour* and will not, you may be sure, suffer herself to be a party to any thing which may appear contradictory to what she has once advanced; and, although perhaps, the yielding of Tournay might be reconciled to the terms of her speech, yet should the queen consent to this exposition of it, such consent would be almost a formal restoration of this place to France; and this, my lords, is what her majesty will avoid:But, I hope, the solu* tion of this difficulty will come from France; and that wheo they have so many other quarrels to decide^ that court will go back from a measure which must involve them iu a dispute with the queen."

The Committee find a Paper, which is said to be delivered among Mr. Prior's loose papers, and seems to be the draught of a letter from Mr. Prior to Mons. de Torcy, pursuant to what lord Bolingbroke bud written to him upon the subject of Tournay; which is in snbstance the same, and. almost in the very words’ of lord Bolingbroke’s letter to Mr. Prior, of the 10th of September, with this addition, that it begins thus: “ There is more appearance than substance in this affair that is uow under agitation at Utrecht, and my Lord Treasurer does not at. all doubt but the court of Fraucewrill find a remedy."

• And his lordship was .not mistaken in his expectations, for M. de Torcy very readily followed the advice that was given by the English ministry; and on the 27th of September, N. S. sends to my lord Bolingbroke a declaration to be made by the French plenipotentiaries at Utrecht, wherein the king’s ministers are •ordered to declare to those of Great Britain,

* That the king did consent to treat of the peace upon the plan laid dowu in the queen's speech to her parliament; but at the same time they were to say, That tiie Dutch having refused to conform to the sentiments of that princess, having rejected the suspension of «rm$, and giving opportunity to the several changes in affairs that had happened, it is but just that his majesty should be recompenced for the expence he has beets obliged to make during the course of this campaign. Upon •this foundation his majesty orders his plenipotentiaries not to sign a peace but upon condition, That Tournay should be restored to him, besides the other places which be has dt-jaaaded, and which he bad reason to believe the queen of Great Britain did design to epa-prehead in her speech, "

The original of this declarationthat came from France, is in the secretary’s office, an^ was sent by M. de Torcy, to lord Bolingbroke, who transmitted a copy of it to the British, slenipoteutiaries; but the. letter of M, de Torcy, in which it was inclosed, does pot apt-pear.

This transaction in relation to Tournay, seems of so extraordinary a nature, as to .der* serve to be set forth in one short view:The dispute concerning it arose from the French ministers insisting to be very particular and express in demanding the restitution of this place; which the British plenipotentiaries cook ceiving to be inconsistent with what the queen had declared, refused to open the conferences until they bad further orders. When this caure to be considered in England, lord Bolingbroke says. It occasioned great warmth in the cabinet council; but his lordship instead of taking measures for preserving the town as part of the barrier of the States General, which, as he confesses, Was sp intended in the queen'^ speech, proposes expedients whereby the town might be restored to France, without the queen's becoming a party to a thing which'.was contradictory to what she had once advanced:And gives his advice to M. de Torcy, by what management Tournay might be secured to the king of France, contrary to the avowed sense of what the queen had declared in parliament and although France had consented in a memorial delivered by abbot Gaultier so early as the 18th of November 1711, not to insist upon Tournay; and this be does in his private car pacity, and not as Secretary of State:But that his lordship was not single in his endeavours to assist France upon this occasion, appear* by the great trouble that he says this matter, had given both him and my Lord Treasurer in the cabinet; and if any regard is to be given to Mr. Prior's, paper, my Lord Treasurer must certainly have written to Mr. Prior .upon this subject, who could otherwise have no ground to. say, My Lord Treasurer does not at, all doubt but the court of France will find a remedy:which is agreeable to what lord Bolingbroke said in other words, when this advice was sent. The solution of this difficulty must.come Jrom France. _•»...<

What. happened afterwards in relation to Tournay, upon what great concessions made.to France, together with the advantageous terms procured for the elector of Bavaria, ibe.mea-suresand councils relating to this affair, were afterwards altered, is not material enough to rt-quire a long detail; but qothibg less than an absolute concurrence, without any mew objections or further demands, was to satisfy for the cession of Tournay j and that it was at last obtained is owing solely to. the firmneeeaud resolution of the States. ... »

The dispute between count Rccbteren, and M. Mesnager was still kept on foot ? and .though k .was at. last left, to her majesty 4o decide upon tbisdifiecerence, > There being some point* relating to commerce^ nod North Amp *

«*]

rica, wlndh are of very great consequence to the interest of the queen’s subjects, and the ROttodr of this treaty still to settle; lord Bo* lirtgbrbke thinks it necessary, though the Dutch may be uneasy that the affair of the four species to be excepted out of the Tariff of 1664, should' still be kept in uncertainty; und die British plenipotentiaries accordingly, to gain time until they could know her majesty’s pleasure, revived the difference between count Rechteren and M. Mesnager; and hope it is for her majesty’s service in this manner to etave off the conferences.

The correspondence carried on between London and Utrecht about this time, relating to the differences that arose concerning the treaty of* Peace, and in particular about our commerce, is contained chiefly in the fourth volume; but as it appears that all the matters in question, being reduced to as narrow a compass as Was possible, were finally to be determined at Paris by the duke of Shrewsbury and Mr. Prior, the Committee think it needless to enter into all the orders and instructiQiis, objections and answers, that went and came too and from Utrecht, where there was indeed but little more1 than the form of a negociation; and conceive that an account of what passed between London and Frauce will set this whole, matter in'a clear light.

Your Committee think it not .improper to take notice here of a remarkable passage or two, that are found ih loid Bolingbroke’s letters to Mr. Prior on the 19th of September,

O. S. Lord Bolingbroke sends Mr. Prior an account of some advices they had received of the invasion of the Leeward Islands by the French.

u This, dear Mat.” says his lordship, tl proves a very untoward contretemps; it gives a theme to the whigs, and serves to awaken passions that were almost lulled asleep. We expected that Cassart’s squadron might be gone to the coast of Brasil, or to Surinam; but we never imagined our colonies would have been attacked by bim, at the time when we were knitting' the bands of friendship between the two nations with all possible industry. Could this ill opinion of our new friends have entered into odr heads, I do assure you be should have teen accompanied by a fleet of the queen’s, which would have kept him in respect.* Compare this conduct with that of the queen’s, &c.” And here follows that passage which has been already mentioned, wherein his lordship declared concerning the order sent to the duke of Ormond, u I will not Say this order saved their army from being beat, bdt I think in my conscience that it did.”

IBs lordship goes on. M In a word we depended so much upon the good understanding, which we thought established, and were so earnest to prevent anything which might break in upon it, that we not only avoided to fortify oar squadron as we might have done, but we also neglected to put in execution some designs which vtould hart annoyed both French and

[lx

Spaniard, perhaps more than any that have been effected, in the course of this war.”

Another instance of his lordship’s good disposition to the French nation is to be found in his letter to Mr. Prior, of the 29th Sept, where* in he says, f* I have got at last the affair of the Griffin compounded, not without very great difficulty; and though the sum paid to tha captors was So large as 35, 600/. the ship was plainly prize, and the pass sent over hither might have beeh proved to bare been numerically one of those I delivered at Fontainbleau, four days after the Griffin was in sir Thomafc Hardy’s power; though Gaultier was ready to swear that he received if some months before; which part of the abbot has, I confess to you, done him no good in my opinion.” From whence it appears, though this pass was none of them, that passes had been granted some months before the suspension was concluded.

Whilst the English ministry are doing these good offices to the subjects of France, _ and taking all opportunities both public and private to espouse their interests, your Committee is surprised at the ill treatment which England received from France at this time, and at their backwardness in making good their promises and engagements they were under in some points that most nearly concerned the interests of Great Britain,

At the latter end of October Mr. Prior was sent into England, and, by what appears, left his residence in France, without the leave or any orders from the queen his mistress; but was sent over by die king of France as a proper person whom he thought fit to intrust with the great secret of prevailing with the queen by her credit to obtain what the king demanded for the elector of Bavaria. He brings a credential letter from the king of France to the queen^ which, seeming something new of the kind, is here annexed. (No. 38.)

About the middle of November, Mr. Prior goes back into France with new instructions, wherein the proposal of a neutrality in Italy is one of the chief articles; and that he might have a perfect knowledge of the queen’s present resolutions and councils in relation to the present treaty of peace, a copy of the last instructions to the plenipotentiaries at Utrecht is given him, that as occasion shall require he might act in all things conformable to the queen’s intentions therein expressed.

He carries likewise a letter from the queen to the king of France, wherein among other things, it is said, That Mr. Prior continuing to behave himself so a$ that his conduct may be intirely agreeable to the king of France, he does but literally execute the orders the queen had given him, and is a proof of his duty and zeal for her service, (No. 39.) After this short digression, to return back to what was just now mentioned; ‘ it appears that when the treaty of peace was ready to be concluded, the advantages Great Britain was to expect and reap from the endeavours of the British ministry, to ateisc and support the cause of France, wort

in a great measure unsettled and undetermined, France began to cavil, and aa lord Bolingbroke said, go back from what the king bad. promised the queen. His lordship cannot be persuaded, as he tells Mr. Prior, “ That the French act either fairly or. wisely; they press us to con* elude, that they may have others at their mercy; and at the same time they chicane with us concerning the most essential article of all our treaty, and endeavour to elude an agreement made, repeated, confirmed.' *

The two great points of moment in dispute, were concerning the fishery at Newfoundland, and in what manner the cession of Cape Breton was to be made; the other was about the treaty of commerce.

* As to the first, it is to be observed, That in the queen's instructions to the duke of Shrewsbury, he is directed to propose, as the queen’s last resolution, that she will consent to give and yield up to his mo9t Christian majesty; the intire possession and propriety of the island of Cape Breton, but with this express condition, That his ?aid majesty shall, on his part, in consideration of the same, relinquish to her majesty all manner of right to fishing and drying fish on the coast of Newfoundland, or any part reserved to his subjects, by the articles signed at London the 27 Sept. (8 Oct.) 1711.

Several representations were sent backward and forward, shewing the fatal consequences of what was demanded by France; and ah though my lord Bolingbroke in his letter to Mr. Prior of the 19th of January 1712-13, insisted that the queen had never yielded what France pretended to, which then remained an unsur-luoun table difficulty; yet in his letter to the fiuke of Shrewsbury of the same date he tells his grace, if the French close with the overture he then made them, with regard to the disputes concerning commerce, her majesty is. willing to accept the last expedient proposed by M. de Torcy, fur adjusting our differences about North America, and to consent that the king, in the cession of Newfoundland, dp reserve to his subjects a right of fishing and drying ort the coast of Newfoundland, from point Riche north about, to Cape Bonavista; and here no direction is given concerning Cape Breton, of which the French.got the iutire possession and propriety; although in the duke of Shrewsbury's instructions, it is declared, that the queen looked upon Cape Breton to belong to her; and reckoned (hat island a part of the ancient territory of Nova Scotia, which is, by this treaty, restored to her. But if his grace could not prevail upon them to agree with him in the article of commerce, he was. to declare. That neither will the queen agree with them in their prppositio, n concerning Newfoundland.

.. Your Committee come now to consider, upon what consideration this great and valuable privilege of taking and drying fish upon the coast of Newfoundland was yielded up to France, .

, In t, his letter from lord Bolingbroke to the $}k$ ofSbrewsbury, i* represented the State

of the great dispute about-commerce, which appears.to be. this: in M. de Torcy's.answer to lord Bolingbroke’s memorial of May the 24th, 1712, it was amoog other things, agreed. That Britain and France should grant to the subjects of each crown reciprocally, the same privileges and advantages, which they shall either of them grant to the subjects of any other nation whatsoever: upon this foundation was established the principle of treating, and. being treated, as gens amicissima; ' and pursuant to this principle the Tariff of 1664, which was granted to Holland, except the four species, was likewise to be granted to us; and by the 8th and lQth articles of the project of the Treaty of Commerce it was sp settled. But France, pretending now that this Tariff would bp too beneficial to us, although we are entitled to it, upon the principle of being used as the 1 amicissima gens, ’ refused to grant it to us, until another Tariff should be made in Britain exactly conformable to that of 1664, whereby our duties should be reduced as low here, as theirs are in France by that Tariff.

This, lord Bolingbroke says, is an open violation of faith; and by this they are removing a corner-stone, which was laid early in the foundation of a building brought almost to perfection; the fall whereof must prove at last of as fatal consequence to them as to us.

He confesses he was strangely surprised when he saw the precedent of the Eyswiclc Treaty quoted, to persuade us to refer our commerce, as the Dutch then did theirs, to commissioners to be treated of after signing the peace. He says, the behaviour of.the French upon that occasion has given us warning; ond lit is from thence we have learned*.* that whatever is referred, is given up; and they must have a mean opinion of those whom they would persuade to pursue the same method, to get the Tariff of 1664, by which the Dutch then lost it.

But surely his lordship had either not learnt this lesson, or had entirely forgot it, when out the 24th of May he himself had proposed, as has been before observed, that several points* relating to commerce, requiring a longer discussion than that crisis would admit, commissaries should be appointed to settle and adjust the differences. But then it seems they wer& more intent upon the general peace, than any. particular advantages.

His lordship goes on to offer an expedient which was to solve till the difficulties: and tells his grace, ‘ J am .commanded to. acquaint you, that having fully opened to< the French, ministers, her majesty’s sense of the king's engagements to her upon this head, you are to prq-pose to them, to strike out of the projects of the treaty of commerce the 9th and 10th art tides, and instead (hereof, to insert. one. to the: effect of that which I have drawn, and which comes here in dosed V and as (he acceptance of this amendment was to put an end to all the differences, and at the same, time give such ample adv antages to France, ibe Freoguepdfij.

•greed to it. -And did insert this article verbatim as it was sent in the treaty of commerce, which makes the 9th article of the treaty as it now stands, and is the same that was rejected by the last parliament; and this article which has been since so universally and justly condemned appears to be the work of the Eriglish ministry, and the price for which they sold te France the fishery of Newfoundland.

This treatment of France could not without doubt but give the ministry the greatest uneasiness, though their apprehensions, lest the circumstances they were in should be known; far exceeded their concern at the disappointment Great Britain was like tp meet with. They had signed a separate treaty with France in September 1711, upon this single principle, that the interests of Great Britain were in the first place to be adjusted; and as long as they had this to say, they were unconcerned at all other events. They bad gone on for fifteen months together, and acted in every thing as the instruments of France, and are at last in danger of being disavowed by France in the most essential part of all their treaty. One of the chief inducements and principal conditions upon which the fatal cessation of arms 'was granted, was that no privileges or advantages relating to dommerce with France shall be yielded to any foreign nation which shall not at the same time be granted to the subjects of her Britannic majesty; but France had now reaped the hill benefit of the suspension, and were at liberty to dispute the principle of gens amicissitaa. ’

In these circumstances were the English ministry in January 1712-13, and to extricate themselves, they give up all points in dispute in North America, and the fishery of Newfoundland, upon the single consideration of the ninth article of the treaty of commerce, which the parliament rejected writh a just indignation.

However, to bring France to a compliance, even upon these conditions, his grace in the same letter is instructed to prevail with France to come to this resolution without the loss of one moment’s time. The parliament was suddenly to meet, and it would be necessary for the queen to communicate to both Houses the present state of the negotiation. His grace is then to represent to M. de Torcy, in the best manner he is able. “ How smoothly every thing would glide along, if the queen was able to speak of her own interests as absolutely determined with France; and on the other hand, what travels we shall be exposed to, and what confusion may arise, if our-negotiation appears to be still open, and if the secret comes to- be divulged, that France refuses to make good in the treaty the full effect of former promises to the queen."

His lordship having finished what he had to say copcerning her majesty’s particular interests, he proceeds upon the general plan of peace, tiQd instructs his grace what he was to inform 9

[Ixif

the French ministers would be the measure of her majesty’s conduct, and what they may expect from her.

* Thaeas the French ministers desire that the queen would precipitate the conclusion of her peace, and leave all the confederacy at their mercy, they must he told, that when the mutual interests or France and England are settled, as they will be, if the propositions contained in the first part of this letter are accepted, the plenipotentiaries of Great Britain shall publicly declare in the congress, that they are ready to sign with those of France, and shall call upon the allies to quicken their negotiations, and conclude without loss of time. But if they seek unnecessary delays, or make unreasonable demands, her majesty, who has induced them to treat, will by the same measures engage them to conclude, or at least she will sign without them.”

“ And the queen having once declared her interests to be settled, and her treaty ready to be signed, the general peace becomes from that moment sure; and the remainder of the negotiation easy; it is therefore wis6 for the French >o comply with her majesty.”

The great distraction the ministry was in appears sufficiently from this long letter of Lord Bolingbroke’sto the duke of Shrewsbury: but to be more folly satisfied what their own apprehensions were, and what they themselves thought would be the consequence of such proceedings; it is necessary to have recourse to two letters written about this time, and upon this subject, by lord Bolingbroke to Mr. Prior. One of January the 19th, the other of the 22d, O. S. The first was of the same date as his letter to the duke of Shrewsbury; and therein his lordship says to Mr. Prior, “ I have, exhausted all my stock of arguments in the long letter which by the queen’s order, I write to the duke of Shrewsbury; to you. I can only add, we stand indeed upon the brink of a precipice, but the French stand there too: Pray tell M. de Torcy from me, that he may get Robin and Harry hanged; but affairs will soon run back into so much confusion, that he will wish us alive again. To speak seriously, - unless the queen can talk of her interests as determined with France; and unless your court will keep our allies in the wrong, as they are sufficiently at this time, I foresee inextricable difficulties.”

“ My scheme is this:let France satisfy the queen, and let the queen immediately declare to her parliament, and in the congress, That she is ready to sign; at the same time let the French plenipotentiaries show a disposition to .conclude with all the allies.” And then his lordship enumerates the several offers which he would have France make to the several allies: which, though very general and insufficient, his lordship says, “ if such overtures as these (made to toe allies) were not instantly accepted, our separate peace would, sitting the parliament, be addressed for, made, and ap^ proved; and the cause of France for once be* come popular in Britain.” *

“ If they wefe accepted, let M. de Torcy sit down an<J consider what a bargain would be made for France; let him remember his journey to the Hague, and compare the plans of 1709, and 1712."

“ M. de Torcy has a -confidence in you: make use of it once for all upon this occasion, and convince him thoroughly, that we must give a different turn to our parliament ^and our people, according to their resolution at this crisis."

The neat letter from his lordship to Mr. Prior, 'is upon the same subject, and of the same .strain:“ We are now, " says his lordship, " at the true crisis of our disease, we die at once or recover at once; let France depart from that shameful expedient by which they thought to bubble us out of the advantages which they had solemnly yielded, and all is well, otherwise, by God, both they and we are undone? ’

“ Pray send Barton back as fast as possible; the queen can neither delay the meeting of parliament longer than the 3d, nor speak to the Houses till we hear from you."

“ My compliments to. M. de Torcy: Let him know, that if they do not agree with the queen, , 1 may perhapa-he a refugee; if I am, 1 promise before hand, to behave myself better in France, than the Flench refugees do .here. Make the French ashamed of their sneaking chicane; by Ffeaven, they treat like pedlars, or, which is worse like attorneys."

• As all these public transactions passed through the hands Of lord Bolingbroke, who, although he was secretary of state, acted extra provincially in all his correspondence with -France; so it appears at the'same time, that his lordship was no(the only person in the secret; but that a greater influence chiefly directed and governed all these councils. And my lord treasurer, as in the great affair of Tour-nay, was in this transaction the chief conductor, as may very reasonably be concluded by several letters that Mr. Prior wrote about this time to my lord treasurer, although Mr. Prior has not thought fit to produce one letter from his lordship to him.

It is to be observed, that these letters to my lord treasurer, were chiefly wrote on the same days that Mr. Prior sent dispatches to the secretaries of state, giving an account of his proceeding, and desiring the queen’s directions upon them; but it seems, he thought not that sufficient without knowing my lord treasurer’s particular pleasure upon them.

Mr. Prior’s dispatch to the secretaries office giving a full account of the present state of the treaty, together with several papers, memorials, and propositions relating to the points in dispute, and concerning commerce and North America, is dated December 28th, N. S.* The day after, Dec. 29th, 1712, N. S. Mr. Prior writes to my lord treasurer, and tells him, I have wrote a book instead of a letter to my lord Bolingbroke, which I desire ycur lordship would be pleased to run over, that knowing What I have done here, you may honour me VOL. VII.

with your commands as to what I am to -do. He hopes his proposal about Newfoundland, which he sends his lordship inclosed, is such as may terminate that affair to our advantage. If your lordship is of the same opinion, I shall hate intire satisfaction.

January 8th; 1712-18. N. S. Mr. Price having sent another full account in form to-the secretary of state, writes the same day to my lord treasurer, that he had been in conferenco with the French ministers to adjust the points undecided between her majesty and the king of France; that he had sent lord Bolingbroke the result of those conferences, as well what was agreed to by the French ministers, as his own remarks upon each particular head; and says, I hope your lordship will find the whole adjusted so far to your satisfaction, as that Our plenipotentiaries may receive their final orders *

I will not doubt but the whole affair of Newfoundland is adjusted to your desire: there were some points insisted upon by our plenipotentiaries which' the ministers here thought very unreasonable; and to say a truth to my lord treasurer plainly, which I a little mitigate to iiy lord Bolingbroke, I think not very reasonable. He then gives an account that M. de Torcy was surprised, that the Dutch had but in part complied with what lord Strafford declared to them to be her majesty’s resolutions, to which he hopes the queen will send such an answer as may cut off all delays; and upon this occasion Mr. Prior says to my lord treasurer, “ This I only write to your lordship, it being a thing that should not be canvassed in counciland I have promised that the king should have her majesty’s answer upon it, as he desires/ *

January 19th, 1712-1S, N. S. Mr. Prior writes again to my lord treasurer; acquaints him, " That thU duke of Shrewsbury now send* to lord Bolingbroke the substance of their last conferences with M. de Torcy, upon the subject of Newfoundland, to which I take leave to add; that your friend Torcy is in the last concern to find the duke’s instructions so strict, its a point which cannot be given up by France, at a time when we well hoped that difference was adjusted. Pray, my lord, let us have your distinct and positive orders hereupon by the first. I send your lordship inclosed a copy of > my letter to my lord Bolingbroke, and duke of Shrewsbury desires, that we may have your orders to finish. I believe Torcy writes himself to you, ” Jan. 23d, 1712-18, N. S. Mr. Prior writes once more to my lord treasurer, and tells him, “I have already wrote so amply to your lordship, on the two great points of Newfoundland, and the tarifl' of 1664, afid expect so daily your last orders upon these twu points, that I will not trouble you at present further than to Say, if these two are settled, the peace may be determined here tomorrow, and, sent the next day to Utrecht to he signed.” And on the 2d Feb-. 1712-13. Mr. Prior says to my lord treasurer; If I desire you Co write to me it is because I really think it for the queen’s service; that in this great post here you have put (E)

lxYli] APPENDIX. — Report rcloting to the[lxyiii

me, I may be able to.say, I have the immediate commands of my lord treasurer; and in regard to that friendship with which you have so publickly honoured me, and which, by the by, does all the business here.” And on Feb. 4th “ I shall direct myself as you shall b? pleased to Instruct me privately.”

If your Committee had fund among the papers delivered by Mr. Prior, my lord treasurer's answers to these letters, they have reason to believe it would have appeared from them, how far the giving up the fishery of Newfoundland, and the accepting of the Oth article of the treaty of Commerce, was owing to his lordship's immediate orders. It seems, however, to be- a very extraordinary proceeding, that the queen's ministers in France, aoting by her authority, and under her instructions, .should apply to my lord treasurer, for his distinct and positive orders to release them from the queen's instructions; because they are thought by the French ministers.to be too strict, and if it be a doubt, by whose order or advice it was procured, so much is.certain, that these applications had their desired effect; and the ^Newfoundland fishery was given up, and the .advantages we were to receive from being treated upon the foot of4 gens atnicissipaa/ were all bu-ufied in that destructive article, the 9th article of the treaty of commerce.

The difficulties relating to North America and commerce being in this manner determined, France was wholly intent upon concluding and signing with' Great Britain, without taking in the rest of the allies; and in this they had the good fortune to have the concurrence and assistance of $he British ministry.

By good management, the dispute raised at Utrecht had been so ordered, that the ministers of the allies could not obtain any conferences with those of France, till the points in difference were adjusted between England and franco: by which means it was February 1712*13, before the Dutch and French were suffered to meet: And it being now the business of France to conclude with England separately, the temper the French plenipotentiaries appeared in, made all business so impracticable, that tjie British plenipotentiaries were under a necessity of complaining of it to lord Bolingbroke, and to acquaint him, Feb. 3d 1712-13. 44 The French appear so very uncomplying in every point debated, and so very forward and positive in their refusal of a great many things, which the Dutch took to be granted and settled, as well by her majesty’s speech as theWeclarations lately made by lord Strafford, that the disappointment they met with, put them in the greatest consternation:Reason was also given qs to participate in these dis> contents, and to regard several things which appear contrary to what her majesty has declared, as very unfair; yet all that could be said orevailed not.”

Your committee is not surprised, that the instances of their excellencies had so little effect with the French plenipotentiaries, who

then expected that orders should be sent to the British plenipotentiaries, immediately to sign a separate peace, which, according to' •their expectations, were sent, by Mr. St. John, ' 'brother to the lord Bolingbroke, to conclude and sign with France as soon, as the duke of Shrewsbury should send them advice that the propositions he was to make at the French court were accepted; and on the 28th lord Bolingbroke with the utmost joy acquaints their excellencies, that he had received from the duke of Shrewsbury the expected returns; and which he doubted not would have reached their lordships. He bad therefore without staying to enter into any other detail, dispatched a courier to them, to renew those instructions which he hoped were clearly enough signified in those papers which his brother carried. He acquaints them that the duke o’F Shrewsbury had declared, that their lordships had orders, in case the French complied, as they now actually have done, to sign her majesty's peace with France without further delay:and that his grace had also declared, that in this case her majesty would open, the parliament, by telling them, she had made a eace with France. These two considerations, is lordship says, were perhaps the most prevalent inducements to the French court; to come roundly into her majesty's propositions; and the queen thinks herself, for this reason, still the more obliged punctually and religiously to fulfil these promises. The latter she will herself perform on Tuesday; and the former, it is her positive command that your lordships make good as fast as the necessary forms of preparing and executing the - instruments will allow. And his lordship looking upon it now, that the chief difficulties relating to the treaty of peace were removed; as likewise in the treaty of commerce, by the article drawn by himself, and proposed by the duke of Shrewsbury, he gives their excellencies positive orders* without any delay, -to 'execute the treaties of peace and commerce between Great Britain and France.

On the 7th, and.. 20th, of March, O. S. lord Bolingbroke repeats these positive orders, and insists, that the peace should be conclude^ with that precipitation which her majesty would have used. And it is observable, 'that among all the demands that were made, upon aceount of any prince or potentate, none at this time met with the least regard; when, at the same time, the interest of the princess Ursini is espoused in the strongest terms. And in the same letter, March the 3d, O. S. where his lordship, speaking of the consequence of. the restoration of the elector of Bavaria to his electorate, says, 44 Her majesty does not much enter into the notion of the degradation of Hanover as a matter of any importance.’* His lordship declares, 44 That the principality in some part of the Spanish Netherlands, with a revenue of 30,000 crowns demanded tor the princess Ursini, must be made to the emperor, and all parties concerned, a condition, 4 sine qua non/ of the general peace, ’ *

lxix} APPENDIX. — Negotiations for Peace': 17 J 5. [Ixx

But the British plenipotentiaries, who were to sign, had some difficulties; s*nd they acquaint lord Bolingbroke; We could say a great deal to justify our cautious proceedings with the French; and are satisfied, that' your lordship would be of the same opinion, if you tvere to see their way of negotiating with all the allies; and how hard it is for us to obtain here what to your lordship seems impossible the French should make any difficulty to grant."

• Therepeated orders to the plenipotentiaries prevailed at last so far upon them, as to acquaint the allies, the queen found it necessary to conclude her own peace without delay; and that time should be allowed those that are not ready: But they still avoided the actual signing, till the rest of the allies, whose treaties were in a forwardness, were ready to sign with them; and, to justify themselves, they acquaint the duke of Shrewsbury, that, besides other considerations, their chief objection was, that though they had orders to sign a particular peace, yet their full powers under the great seal, only authorized them to negotiate, agree, and conclude the conditions of a good and general peace, agreeable to the interest of all, and each of the allies. And what made them more averse, was the great importunity with which the French pushed them to sign separately. We are surprised at the eagerness of the French ministers to have us conclude with them aloue, when so many of the allies are, in a manner, ready to join with us; nor can we enough apprehend the consequences at home of doing it alone.

Lord Bolingbroke, who says lie has not sagacity enough to find the objections that the plenipotentiaries had made to their first full powers, for their satisfaction, sends them a new commission, and repeats to them positive qrders to sign and conclude with France; for which purpose they were to appoint a day to desire them to be ready; and at the same time to press such as could not be ready by that day, to fix some other on which they will sign.

By this new commission, his lordship tells them, they have a power, as before tractandi

* conveuiendique’ the conditions, of a good and general peace, which is no more than you are to do when you are to offer, jointly with the ministers of France, a general plan to the allies.

, These difficulties of the plenipotentiaries made' my lord treasurer, who never failed to exert himself when he found it absolutely necessary, think it high time to interpose his authority; and accordingly, March the 31st,

N. S. wrote to my lord Strafford in this, manner; “ I must felicitate your excellency upon the success of all your zeal, and the true love-yqu have shewn to your queen, your country, and repose of, all. Europe."

The remaining. danger is, lest we should suffer shipwreck in the sight of the port. The nation herd are five hundred to one for peace. The warriors are driven from their out-works;

the last retrenchment they have is delay; and

I must say this operates much here: The ferment begins to work, and it will be impossible to answer for the turn the House of Commons will take, if these delays provoke them further. They all feel how many hundred thousand pounds this needless protraction costs them. We now maintain forty nine thousand effective men by land, and thirty thousand, within a trifle, by sea. In the mean time, the merchants lie off, and will not come into port; the amusement of stories invented by the faction, and the correspondence and encouragement that party gives to their friends to hold out, and to wait for some unhappy accident that may unravel all which is done: Add to this, the ill humour which will grow in members, by being kept so long in town idle; and in one word, all that has been unsettled for many days, is not worth one day's charge England is at extraordinarily by this delay. I find this seems to be the prevailing universal opinion here; and that France has acquitted herself; the only stop is now at Utrecht." But this stop did not now remain long; and as his lordship never. yet appeared in vain, all further obstructions at Utrecht were after this soon removed. April the lst-llth, 1713, the treaties of peace and commerce between Great Britain and France were signed, between two and three in the afternoon. This example was followed by several of the allies, who came dropping in one after another:and last of all, when it was in vain to hold out aoy longer, the Dutch about midnight signed their treaties of peace and commerce; and the emperor and empire alone chose rather to hear the whole weight of the war, than submit to such disadvantageous and dishonourable terms as had been carved out for them by England and France.

The peace being thus settled between Great Britain and France, your Committee find, froia the negotiation which remained still to be carried on with Spain, that the queen's plenipotentiaries did suffer a clause to be inserted at the end of the 15th article of the peace with Spain, whereby they gave a pretence to the Spaniards to claim a right to fish at Newfoundland. ' X

The words of the article are these; Whereas 'it is insisted on the part of Spain, that certain' rights of fishing at the island of Newfoundland, belong to the Guipuscoans, or other subjects of the catholic king; her Britannic majesty consents and agrees, that all such privileges as the Guipuscoans, and other people of Spain, are aide to make claim to by right, shall be allowed and preserved to them.

• This claim of the Spaniards is contrary to the 7th and 8th articles of the treaty made with that, crown by sir William Godolphin, the 8th-18th July, 1670, whereby it is agreed, that the most serene king of Great Britain, his heirs and successors, shall have, hold, keep, and enjoy for ever, with plenary right of sovereignty, dominion, possession, and property, all those land, regions, islands, colonies, and places whatsoever; being or situated in the West Indies;

Jxxi] APPENDIX. — Report relating to the [lxxii

or in any part of America which the said king of Great Britain, and his subjects, do at present hold and possess.

And that the subjects and inhabitantsrmer-ebauts, captains, masters of ships, mariners, of the kingdoms, provinces, and dominions, of each confederate respectively, shall abstain and for* bear to sail and trade in the ports and havens which have fortifications, castles, magazines, or ware-houses, and in all other places whatsoever, possessed by the other party iuthe West Indies; to wit, the subjects of the king of Great Britain Shall not sail unto, and trade in the havens and places, which the catholic king holdeth in the said Indies; nor in like manner, shall (he subjects of the king of Spain fail unto, or trade in those places, which are possessed there by the king of Great Britain.

The board of trade was consulted upon the Spaniards claiming a right to fish at Newfoundland soon after the late peace, and returned the following answer to lord Dartmouth, dated June 13 th 1712-13.

That in obedience to her majesty's commands, signified to us by your lordships of the 1st instant, we have considered the extract of a memorial from the marquis de Monteleon, relating to a claim of the inhabitants of the province of Guipuscoa, to fish on the coast of Newfoundland; and thereupon take leave to inform your lordship, that we have'discoursed with such persons as are able to-give us information in that matter; and we find that some Spaniards have come thither with passes from her, majesty, and others may have fished there privately; but never any, that we can learn, did do it as of right belonging to them.

By the act to encourage the trade to Newfoundland, passed in the 10th and 11th years of his late majesty, when we were ia amity and alliance with Spain, it is declared and enacted, that no alien or stranger whatsoever, not re-aiding within the kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, shall at any time hereafter take, bait, or use any sort of trade or fishing whatsoever, in Newfoundland, or in any of the islands adjacent: pursuant to which act, instructions have been given every year to the commodores of the convoys, to prevent foreigners coming thither.

The Committee find themselves at a loss to account for the reasons that prevailed with the minstry to admit the insertion of this article; and upon this occasion they think themselves obliged to acquaint the House, that they find very few footsteps remaining of the whole transaction, relating to commerce with Spain. It appears that the management of it was entrusted -with Mr, Gillingham, an Irish papist, who was sent thither for that purpose; for which reason lord Lexington, in his letters to lord Dartmouth, frequently excuses himself for not writing upon that subject, Mr. Gillingham giving such full accounts of the matter; notwithstanding which, no one letter from Mr. Gillingham' to the secretaries office can be found; and the com-npttec are iuduced to believe, that this whole

transaction was carried* on by another way. i From a letter of lord Lexington to lord Dart* mouth of January the. 9th 1712, wherein his lordship, speaking of. the business of commerce, says, u Mr. Gillingham gives an account of the steps we, have made, sol don’t trouble you with, them again; knowing that what goes tor my lord treasurer, is the same asjto yourself.1 ’

From this passage it appears evident to your Committee, that a correspondence was carried on between the earl of Oxford and Mr. Gillingham, in relation to our treaty of commerce with. Spain. But for want of the papers which passed between them upon this subject, your committee is likewise at a loss to find what motives could induce.the British ministry to admit so essential an alteration of the treaty of commerce, signed by the queen’s plenipotentiaries* as is made by the three explanatory articles, as they are called, which are added to the said treaty, and are, in an unprecedented manner, inserted in the ratification of it; notwithstanding it doth not appear, they had; ever been consented to, much less signed, * by any of the queen’s plenipotentiaries; amongst other very, material disadvantages to which the^e articles subject our merchants, your Committee is informed, that, by. virtue of them, Spain- does actually at this time demand of our merchants fourteen per cent, on account of Cientos, Millones, and Alcavalas, over and above fifteen per cent, which they exact for other duties, (No. 44.) which added to tl>em, amounts to no less than twenty nine per cent, whereas, it is notorious* that, during the reign of king Charles 2, of Spoilt, the whole duties exacted, and paid by our merchants, for all goods imported to the several ports of Spain, computed by an average, did never exceed ten per cent, but rather fell short of it. By what management these artdes were ratified, and how legal and warrantable it was to affix the great seal to articles so pernicious in their contents, and so irregularly offered, your Committee must submit to the consideration of the House.

Your Committee having thus gone through the chieftransactions relating to the negociations of peace and commerce, proceed to offer to the House what they have found material in the papers referred to them concerning the Catalans.

After several unsuccessful attempts by the way of Portugal, and the design upon Cadiz, to settle king Charles on the throne of Spain; and that the confederate fleet had appeared before’ Barcelona in 1704, without the desired success; her majesty in the beginning of the year 1705, sent Mr. Crowe as her minister to Genoa, with private instructions which are here annexed, (No. 45.) to the follo wing effect: That herVnajes-ty being informed, that the people of Catalonia* were inclined to cast off the yoke imposed on them by the French; and by withdrawing* themselves from the power of the duke of Anjou, to return to the obedience of the House or Austria, was desirous to maintain and improve that good disposition in- them; and to induce them to put the same speedily m execution,

hacf made choice of him to carry tin so great a work, for the advantage of her service, and the good of the common cause. He is therefore ordered to repair to Genoa, Leghorn, or such Other neutral country or place, as he should judge most proper, for carrying on her majesty’s service in this particular; and to treat with the Catalans, or any other people of Spain, about their coming into the interest of Charles the third of Spam, and joining With}her majesty and her allies. For that purpose he is to inform himself what number' of forces they will raise, and what they expect shall be sent to assist them:If any of the/ nobility insist upon a sum of money to be advanced to them, he must fissure them, he does not doubt but he shall be empowered to remit to them whatsoever is necessary and reasonable for their support, as soon as they are actually in the field:That he shall give the Catalans, or other Spaniards, assurances of her majesty’s utmost endeavours to procure the establishment of all such rights and immunities as they have formerly enjoyed under the House of Austria; that she has, for their further satisfaction, sent to king Charles the third, for powers for confirming the same to them; and that she is willing, if they insist on it, to give her guarranty that it shall be doae.

Mr. Crowe had also a commission, (No. 46,) of the same date with his instructions, to treat with the Catalans upon the terms before-mentioned, upon this express condition on their side, that they should acknowledge, and receive king Charles as lawful king of Spain, and utterly renounce the House of Bourbon.

He had with this; credential letters, (No. 47,) signed by the queen, directed to the nobility, magistrates, and all officers, civil and military, of Catalonia, desiring them, to depend upon the promises he should make them in her name.

The earl of Peterborough, and sir Cloudesly Shovel, by their instructions, (No. 48,) dated May 1st, 1705, are likewise ordered to use their endeavours to induce the Catalans to join with them in their undertakings: and to animate that people to prosecute their liberty with mare vigour, they are empowered to assure them of the queen’s support, and to promise them in the aueen’s name, that she wiH secure them a confirmation of their rights and privileges from the king of Spain, that they may be settled on a lasting foundation to theth and their posterities. But lest persuasions alone should not prevail, they are ordered, in case the Catalans make no suitable return to these kind offers, to annoy the towns on the coast of Spain, and to reduce them by force.

Ip conformity to these instructions, a declaration was drawn here, and delivered by Mr. Secretary Harley to the earl of Peterborough, for his lordship to publish in Spam, foH of assurances in the queen’s name, of support, and of their liberties on the one hand, ana threats on the other; which declaration his lordship, on his arrival in Spain, did* accordingly publish, (No. 49.) s v

The successes of that expedition need not be

[lxxiv

here particularly mentioned: King Charles, in his letter to the queen, Oct. 29, 1705, gives an* account of them, and what they were owing to, viz. “ The assurances of your majesty’s generous protection, upon which my subjects in Cataldnia expose their lives and fortunes.”

No want of fidelity or zeal for the common cause, during a long war, that abounded with extraordinary turns of fortune, was ever objected to these people; on the Contrary, they received to the last the applauses of the allies, and assurances repeated to them by every general and minister that was sent from Great Britain, to that country; that they should never be abandoned.

When the queen entered into separate measures of peace) lord Lexington iva9 sent ambassador to Spain; at which time, considering the circumstances of king Philip’s affairs, and the obligations he had then received from the queen, the Catalan privileges, if plainly demanded and insisted upon, could not have been refused, and without it, could never be expected to be granted to a people so remarkably zealous for the common cause.

But his lordship's instructions, (No. 50,) in-^ stead of directing him to insist upon this, as condition of the queen’s coining into the peace, i order him only to represent to the court of Spain, that it is no less for the king’s interest, than Tor the queen’s honour, that a general amnesty without exception be granted to all Spaniards who have adhered to the House of Austria, and in a particular manner to the Catalans, with regard to their persons, estates, dignities, and privileges,

These Instructions, though very defective, were not complied will); for lord Lexington, in the 11th article of his paper, which is called demands, (No. 51,) delivered to the court of Spain ofion his arrival there, expresses himself thus: That the queen prays his Catholic majesty, that a general amnesty without exception be granted; but leaves out thq words m his instructions with regard to their persons, estates, dignities, and privileges.

The king’s answer was, That the general amnesty delating entirely to the general peace, was not proper for the present treaty; and, therefore he leaves it to be then treated of: that his majesty will make use of his great clemency, provided the queen will contribute to the safety, to the repose, and to the interests, of so many faithful subjects, who, according to their duty, had followed his righteous cause in Flanders, and in all the parts of Italy; and that, an express article be inserted in the peace, wherein it shall be declared, That all subjects' who have done their duty, by adhering to his Catholic majesty, shall be established in their estates and honours, of what nature soever they be, which they enjoyed when they were under his obedience; and that they may mortgage, exchange or sell, at their pleasure; and; that they shall have' full liberty to continue inj the service of their lung; and that neither upon this pretext, or any other whatsoever,

they shall receive the least prejudice, or the least harm in their estates and honours, or any molestation whatever, and that aoy municipal law to the contrary (if there be any such) shall be made void by the treaty of peace.

Lord Lexington transmits this answer to England, which, though containing ti direct refusal at present of what was desired, and only general assurances of clemency from the king, on conditions that could not possibly be expected to be complied with; yet his lordship in his letter to lord Dartmouth, writes word, That the llth article (which is ibis about the Catalans) was agreed to; and thinks what they desire is but justice: and then goes on; “ Thus, my lord, I have finished my negotiation in the best manner I could, and hope it will be to her majesty's satisfaction."

No dissatisfaction was shewn by the ministry in England, either with this manner of negotiating, or the fruitlessness of it, but he is ordered to proceed In the business, both as it was an act of hnm, anity, which every one to the •utmost of their power ought to promote; and that the interest of the king of Spain was mos£, nearly concerned by that means to get ithe Germans out of the counrry.

Hereupon another memorial for an amnesty is presented, the motive used to induce the king to grant it, is his own interest, and to remove the Germans, without any notice taken of the queen’s honour being concerned in the affair.

The king answered, That the Catalans had deserved little from him; that they were now reduced to a small extent of ground, by /the withdrawing of the troops of Britain and Portugal; that his troops, and those of the king his grandfather, were entering into their country -by three several ways; therefore more in complaisance to the queen, than for the arguments that had been offered, he was willing to grant his pardon to those Catalans, who acknowledging his clemency, and repenting them of their error, should submit to his dominion and vassalage, within a time to be prefixed.

Count Sinzendorff, in the project for evacuating Catalonia, insisted upon the preserving the people their privileges:' but the king of Spain refused it, and would only grant them an amnesty and pardon.

Lord Dartmouth in his letters both to the marquis de Monteleone, and .lord Lexington, •ays, He cannot express the queen’s surprise to hear, that the privileges of the Catalans were not intended to be preserved to them by the court of Spain; that those privileges were necessarily included in the meaning of a general amnesty already granted; that this was an affair wherein the queen’s honour was extremely concerned, and.thrt she was obliged by motives of conscience not-to depart from it. Lord Lexington is hereupon ordered to insist again upon it, in the strongest manner imaginable; that when the king of Spain is convinced of her majesty’s steadiness, and the firmness of her resolution to adhere to this demand, no doubt

he will yield to what has been so solemnly promised, and is in itself so reasonable. That the marquis de Monteleone, being restrained by his instructions from treating upon this point, the negotiating of it must intirely lie upon lord. Lexington.

Accordingly^his lordship presents another memorial for a general amnesty, with the confirmation of all their privileges. The amnesty, he says, was granted, but the privileges intirely refused, and in such a positive stile as.he never met with, but in demanding a tract of ground about Gibraltar.

In another letter, Speaking of the many denials he met with in Spain, he says, “ Things are not here upon the same foot as they were before the suspension, for the king told me these words, We know that the peace is as necessary for you as for us, and that you will not_ break it off for a trifle, ’ ’

It may seem at first sight unaccountable how the queen’s endeavours could fail of success, when she declared her conscience was concerned in this matter, and that, though she desired a peace, she would not act inconsistently with honour and justice (o obtain it.

The first fatal step to the ruin of the 'Catalans, was the orders sent lord Lexington, (contrary to his first instructions) upon his arrival at Madrid to acknowlege Philip as king of Spain in a private audience, before any one article of peace or commerce was settled with him, which put him in a condition of refusing this, and whatever .else he should think fit.

The manner how Spain gained this important point appears to be as follows: Lord Dartmouth had acquainted Mr. Prior, that lord Lexington was not to acknowledge Philip as king of Spain, till he had agreed to the demands his lordship was to make in the queen’s name.

However lord Dartmouth thinks it convenient the sentiments of the French court should he known upon this matter as soon as possible.

This method of proceeding with Spain was very much disliked in prance, and Mr. Prior writes lord Dartmouth a very elaborate letter, full of M. de Torcy’s reasons to induce our ministry to recede from that point, and concludes with this remarkable one; “ That the whole treaty being eventual, this acknowledgment of Philip as king of Spain, would fall as the other points, unless the conditions were made good, and the peace agreed and ratified."

Hereupon lord Bolingbroke determines this matter in favour of Spain, by imputing the. former directions to lord Dartmouth’s mistaking the queen’s meaning: And writes Mr. Prios, word that he was equally surprised and vexed, to find by the uncouth way of explaining the queen’s sense, that Mr. Prior had been led to imagine it was intended lord Lexington should make any difficulty of acknowledging the king of Spain as such. “The proceeding this way, by acknowledging the king ill the first place, " (says his lordship,) “ seems natural, civil, apd

Ixxvii]

unexceptionable, but any other scheme is absurd, and inconsistent with all the rest ot‘ oar proceedings.” And then concludes, “ for God’s sake, dear Mat. hide the nakedness of thy country, and give the best turn thy fertile brain will furnish thee with, to the blunders of thy countrymen, who are not much better politicians than the French are poets.”

Lord Dartmouth it seems thought fit to acquiesce, and the same day that this letter was writ, dispatched orders to lord Lexington, to acknowledge king Philip in the first place, notwithstanding his former instructions to the contrary.

But to return to the Catalans. Nor did the ministers shew that zeal fqr the queen’s honour as might be expected, but plainly gave this matter up. Lord Bolingbroke, in his letter to the queen’s plenipotentiaries at Utrecht, tells them, it is not for the interest of England to preserve the. Catalan liberties; and likewise begs leave to make an observation to them, that the Catalan privileges are the power of the purse and sword; but that the Castillian privileges, which the king of Spain will give them (in exchange for their Catalan) are the liberty of trading, and resorting to the West Indies, and a capacity of holding those beneficial employments the king has to bestow in America; which, says his lordship, “ are of infinitely greater value to those who intend to live in a due subjection to authority.”

“ Lord Lexington also, instead of supporting the Catalan privileges, treated the people as rebels; and to induce Spain to make peace with Portugal, puts M. Orry in mind of the necessity Spain is in of withdrawing their troops from Andalusia, in order to end the rebellion of the Catalans. (No. 53.)

When the convention was forced upon the emperor for the evacuating Catalonia, the imperial ministers at Utrecht insisted upon the preserving by that treaty the privileges of Catalonia, Majorca, and Ivica; but Frantfe and her confederates insisting, that that matter should be referred to the peaee, the imperial ministers at last acquiesced, upon the queen of Great Britain’s declaring again, that she would interpose her good offices in the most effectual maimer to obtain the privileges, of Catalonia, Majorca, and Ivica:And the French king engaged at the same time to join his endeavours for that purpose. Hereupon the negociation in Spain was kept up till our treaty of peace with that crown was ripe, by which the Catalan liberties were to be abandoned. This lord Lexington signed, contenting himself with protesting against that article, at the same time he signed it; as he had writ word before he intended to do, and that therefore the queen was intirely at liberty to reject it.

Notwithstanding the king of Spain’s former refusal, lord Lexington is, again directed to insist upon the Catalan privileges, and is again told, “ That the queen thought herself obliged by the .strongest ties, viz. those of honour and conscience, to insist upon h, for a people whom

[Ixiviji

the necessity of the war had obliged her to draw into her interest. His lordship had signed the treaty with Spain before these orders te present another memorial arrived.

He thereupon acquaints the marquis of Bed-mar, that he was sorry he was obliged to do any thing which he knew was against the king’s sentiments, but having received express orders, he must follow his duty, and present the following memorial..

“ The under-written minister of the queen of Great Britain, in'pursuance of the strict orders he received the last post, is obliged most humbly to renew the instances be has so frequently made to your majesty, in favour of the Catalans:The queen orders him to represent, that she has nothing more at heart, than to obtain for those people the same privileges they formerly eojoyed; which she thinks herselt obliged to do, by the tw'o strongest motives'that are possible, viz. honour and conscience, that she may not leave a nation, which the misfortune of war obliged her to draw into her interest, in a worst condition than she found them. She hopes, that after all the pains she has taken for procuring a solid and lasting peace to Europe, your majesty will not leave her with the grief of having been the occasion of the loss of the privileges of that people, but rather, that in regard to the strict friendship which with God’s blessing is so near being established between both your majesties, as well as the union so necessary to the inrerests of both nation*; your majesty will not make any difficulty any louger to grant this favour td her majesty which she ha» so much at heart.”

“ The Marquis de Bedmar’s answer to this memorial was, that this point about the Catalans having been debated in the treaty lately concluded, and signed in this court by his excellency and himself, which his excellency vyiil own, and may be pleased to acknowledge, the king does not see that any thing further is to be done in the matter.

u This treaty was 6ent to England, and ratified by the queen. Lord Dartmouth says that lord Bolingbroke had the principal share in the negociation, and that the article of the Catalans was put in as soft terms as was consistent, with the queen’s honour to allow.

The terms of the treaty are, that the Catalans shall have the same privileges as the king’s best beloved subjects the Castilians enjoy.

When the king of Spain had received this convincing proof of our ministry’s attachment to his interests, and that the before mentioned ties of the queen’s honour and conscience were, of no force with them when opposed to his desires, he takes a further step, and directly pro-, poses to lord Lexington, that the queen would assist him with ships to brock up Barcelona* (No. 56.)

His lordship’s answer was, that he was afraid this proposal would meet with this difficulty, that her majesty would be very unwilling ta lend her ships to exterminate a people that had taken up arma in a great measure at the instil

gation of her ministers; and that ahe would think die had done enough to gratify the king in not insisting upon the preserving for them their ancient liberties, without helping to destroy them. But the regard the ministry had to this request of the king, will afterwards appear.

The French ambassador and the Princess dec Ursins proposed to lord Lexington, and the night before he left Madrid, the king sent for him, and engaged him to write a letter, concerted with, and approved by, the king, to the regency of Barcelona, (No. 57.) advising them to submit themselves to their king. His lordship .assures them of his constant endeavours to do the best be could for them; that God had not permitted him to do more than he had done:That if they would take their resolutions soon, before he was out of Spain, he would write for them in the manner they ‘should desire; and concludes his letter with new assurances of his concern for th6ir interests.

To make this appear the more friendly to them, he tells them, he had entrusted the consul at Alicaut to get this letter conveyed to them, upon some pretence or other; though a duplicate of it was also sent to the count of Lecheraine, one of the king of Spain’s generals before the town, with direction to have it seat in as by a deserter, without his knowledge. {No. 58.)

Mr. Burch, his lordship’s secretary, amongst other reasons, gives this for the writing this letter; that if the Catalans had a mind to accommodate, the queen would have the mediation, and if they had not, that then the court of Spain would see, that her majesty would be always ready to serve them. (No. 59.)

But this artifice to induce the Catalans to abandon their defence in hopes of his lordship’s good offices, had no effect upon men determined to die for the liberty of their country.

Nothing but force could extort that from them: and therefore sir Patrick Lawless, in September, 1713, presents a memorial (No. 60,) to the same effect with what was proposed the month before to lord Lexington in Spain, -setting forth that the Catalans and Majorcans had not submitted themselves to the king’s obedience, and interrupted ail commerce and correspondence in the Mediterranean; and submits it to the consideration of the queen, not only as gurantee of the treaty of evacuation, but as it concerned the interests of Great Britain: and . therefore his catholic majesty hopes the queen will order a squadron of her ships to reduce his subjects to their obedience, and thereby complete the tranquillity of Spain, and of the Mediterranean commerce.

As soon as the season of the year would permit, a fleet is accordingly fitted out- for the mediterranean, under the command of sir James Wishart, whose first instructions bear date 28 Feb. and the additional, 18 March 1713*14 by which (No 61, and 62.) he is ordered to.inforce a strict observance of the treaty of evacuation in all its parts, upon any complaints

[lxx *

of the queen’s subjects, of interruptions of commerce, or depredations by the vessels of Catalonia, Majorca, Sardinia, Naples, and other places, to demand restitution; and, in case of refusal, to make reprisals. To repair with the fleet before Barcelona, then besieged by the enemy, and demand immediate payment of the value of the queen’s stores in the town, or a sufficient security for payment in some reasonable time. To take care. to time his arrival before the town, according to the advices from lord Bingley, then designed to he sent to Spain; by the strongest representations to induce the regency of Barcelona to accept of the terms that shall be obtained for them. To take all the necessary measures pursuant to the queen’s intentions to put an end to the confusions that now reign in those parts: And all proper methods of persuasion to induce the inhabitants oftMajorca to submit to the terms that shall be offered them; and in case of refusal, to employ his squadron in countenancing and assisting all attemps which may be made for reducing them to a due obedience.

It may not be improper in this place, to take notice,

1st, That although the queen had engaged herself, by the treaty of evacuation, to interpose her good offices in the most effectual manner to obtain the Catalans their liberties, yet instead thereof the most effectual methods were used to the contrary; and Mr. Prior acquainted Monsieur Torcy, that the queen was assured the Catalans would submit upon the terms before offered by the king of Spain, without so-much as mentioning their ancient privileges any more. (No 66.)

2dly, That the French king who had put himself under the same obligation as the queen by the said treaty, after this account from Mr. Prior, of the queen’s sentiments, thought fit also not to ask for their privileges; Mr. Torcy also alleging, that the king had little interest with the court of Spain.

3dly, That Britain was under the same engagements by that treaty, to support the privileges of Majorca, as those of Catalonia, at the time sir James Wishart had direct orders to attack them.

4thiy, That when these rigorous measures were forming against the Catalans, lord Bolingbroke writes word to Mr. Prior, that by what we observe in the Catalan agent here, of whom we have never taken the least notice as a public man, it is pretty plain that a reasonable accommodation might be made, as he expresses it, with that turbulent people. (No. 64.) What was called turbulency in the Catalans, may appear by their answer to the duke of Popoli, the king of Spain’s general, - who summoned them to surrender. They told him they would die'rather than be slaves; but if their ancient liberties were confirmed to them, they would open their gates, 'and receive him with ail gladness.

The House of Lords expressed their concern in a public manner for the miseries of the Ce 9

APPENDT£+-lUport relating to tko

txxxi] APPENDIX__rNegatiiuioiufor Peace: 1715. [lxxxii

talaosjund by their address to the queen, the 94 of April, 1714, made it their moat bumble and earnest request to her majesty, that she would bf graciously pleased to continue her interposition in the most pressing manner, that the Catalans may have the full enjoyment of their just and ancient privileges continued to them.

Her majesty's answer was, that at the time she concluded her peace with Spain, she resolved to use her interposition upon every occasion for obtaining those liberties, and to prevent, if possible, the misfortunes to which that people are exposed, by the conduct of those more nearly concerned to help them.

Hereupon, for form's sake, and to allay the indignation conceived against the ministry by the people in general, who compassionated the calamities of those who fought for liberty, the demaud of the Catalan privileges is again put down in lord Bingley’s instructions, who was before ordered to go to Spain, but was never tent.

So that the only favour obtained from the ministry by this earnest address of the House -of Loras, in hehalf of the Catalans, was an intimation sent by lord Bolingbroke to the admiral not to appear before Barcelona nor to attack the Majorcans, till be should hear from ford Bingley and receive directions from England. Ami also a letter from his lordship to Mr. Grimaldo, above two months after the Address, though the town was invested at the time of making it; Wherein be makes a kind and friendly complaint, as he terms it, that the Catalan privileges had not been yet granted them, nor any reasonable terms offered, which they n\ust cither have accepted, or forfeited the queen's compassion, and that of the whole world.

The^admiral had also his scruples, whether his orders, couched in ambiguous terms, would justify him in attacking Barcelona. He therefore writes to lord Bohnbroke and lord Bingley upon it, and submits it to lord Bingley’s consideration, whether the Catalans might not refuse conditions tljat may be most advantageous, if they find he is not to act by force; and desires that hjs orders to act before Barcelona, either by force or otherwise, may be very plain and clear, assuring him that be will most punctually obey those already given him, and such as he shall hereafter receive.,

' When sir James Wishart arrived at Cache, he gave the governor a list of the ships under his command for the Mediterranean service, who sent it immediately to Madrid; but though several messages came from court to the governor during the admiral's stay there, no oue compliment was made him, to signify his arrival Was welcome, or any question asked about -what services he was to perform, which a little surprised him; that as soon as they bad an account at Madrid, of his arrival at Cadiz, 2Vfr. Onry was dispatched to Catalonia with full power to treat with the Catalans; so that, says he, it would appear, that though the king «f Spain lias all the advantage of the queen's

VOL, VII,

ships, as much as if they were actually before Barcelona, by representing to those people, which they very well know, our arrival in thefo parts, and bow far we are on our way to the Mediterranean, yet the king would not seem to owe the soccen of such agreement to the queen and her ships, but to France only.

But this negotiation of Mr. Orry foiling of success, by the Catalans' refusing to submit without having their liberties granted them, obliged the court of Spain to take more notice than otherwise they were inclined to do of the admiral, who from Alicant writes to lord Bing* ley, then expected at Madrid, that he had received a very civil letter from Mr. Grimaldo, who sent him the king's order-for exempting the provisions for the fleet from paying any duty. He tells him, that this exemption was usually granted to the admiral himself that commanded, but being a trifle, he submits it to his lordship’s better judgment, whether the granting him this might not be a means to prevent any thing that might be intended by the court at Madrid more to his advantage, and leaves it to his lordship's consideration what may be most for his interest at that place; and hopes by his friendship to And some 'marks of favour frota thence in regard to his expence in this expedition, so much intended for their service, and for which he has no allowance from home but his pay, which will not defray half his charges, (No. 65.)

In another letter of sir James Wishart fo lord Bingley, he acquaints his lordship, that though he had formerly desired him to move the king of Spain, that the grant of exemption of duties for provisions for this Fleet might be made to himself, yet upon farther consideration of the matter, which is but of small moment, and may appear greater at the court of Spain and England than really it is, he desires his excellency not to take any notice of it, but let it stand as it does; and desires his excellency's countenance and assistance upon any other occasion, that the court of Madrid might take to express their good will to him, (No. 66.) Nor was it long before the admiral gave die court of Spain more particular proofs that he was not unworthy of their expected favours.

After Barcelona had been invested a considerable time by the Spaniards, and reduced to great difficulties for want of provisions, the French king, though engaged with the queen, by the treaty of evacuation, to employ his good offices in the most effectual manner, in favour of the Catalan liberties, thought fit to send-his troops against them, commanded by marshal Berwick, who opened the trenches before Barcelona, the first of July O. S. 1714. And on the 8th of the same month, sir James Wishart, in the queen’s name, writ them a threatening letter, (No. 67.) directed to the deputies, and other? who possessed the government there, telling them, that complaint^ had been made of their disturbing the commerce of the queen's subjects, and that-they had insolently presumed to take, carry up, and*plunder, their ships, and

• used: the men in a barbarous tnahner; he had therefore thought fit to send captain Gordon with two men of war, to represent to them these unwarrantable and presumptubos proceedings; and by the queen’s command demands imme-

diate satisfaction for the samfl$ and the punishment of the officers of the ships with the ut-mo9f severity. If this be not punctually complied with, he leaves it - to themselves to judge what the consequences may be.

The.deputies returned Answer, (No. 68.) that only one of those vessels mentioned in captain

* Gordon’s memorial, was taken by them into Barcelona, being laden with salt, for which they paid the price immediately to the captain of it; that being besieged, they thought they might do so with justice, and by the law of nations; that they were far from living like pirates, as their enemies suggested in order to distress them, by preventing any one’s coming

. with provisions for their relief; that what English vessels had entered their Port with provisions, had been well treated, and had freely told their merchandize, and . at a higher price than they cotild have got any where else; that they had paid them with their best sort of money, and to all their satisfactions; that they . had that day published an order, ; forbidding upon pain of death any of their ships to molest any English, even though they were going with provision to, the enemy.

They hope his excellency will he- satisfied '.with their conduct, which is conformable to the rights of people that are besieged; assuring him, that when they shall know of any of’their ships, either with commission, or without, that shall have Gaused the least damage to any English, th«y will not only immediately inflict .a rigorous punishment, but repair all the damage; desiring to live in the good correspondence they have had with his noble and generous nation, with the utmost deference for the queen, and ready to obey his excellency’s orders with all affection and respect.

The government of Barcelona in their extremity writ another letter to the admiral, dated July the 23d, (No. 69.) setting forth, That his excellency very well knew that the engagement Catalonia entered into to receive Charles the .Sd for their king, was founded on the protection of the high allies, but most particularly of England, without which they were not capable of undertaking so great an enterprize. That they had for 7 years together endeavoured to serve 1 the English nation in every thing it was possible for them to do, by contributing troops and considerable sums of money without interest. And though they had pleased themselves with the thoughts of the happiness to be always subjects of Charles 3, yet by the ordinary change to which human affairs are liable, they now see the troops of the duke of Aqjou, aided by the French, masters of 'all the principality except Barcelona and Cardona, committing through , the whole the most, execrable hostilities, burnings, and-plunderings, without sparing the ef-fusiou of innocent blood, and without distinction of age or sex.

That for a year together the enemies army . had oppressed Barcelona by sea and land, making them continually suffer the calamities of so long a blockade; during which time the enemies have thrown fourteen thousand bombs into the town, which have ruined the greatest part of the houses; that now they expect to be attacked in form; and that in hours the town will be battered in breach. They cannot express their affliction, to see the danger of the inhabitants exposed to be the victims of that cruelty with which the enemy threatens to treat them. . Having no comfort left, they fly to the queen of Great Britain, beseeching her*protection by the inclosed letter to Don Dalmases, their envoy at London; and in the mean time, till an answer can come, they beseech his excellency from their souls to mediate with the French troops who opprest them, for a suspension of arms, since the congress at Baden, now silting to conclude of a general peace, may still determine' this affair; they doubt not that his mediation will be able to procure them this relief, since his squadron is superior to that of the enemy. They see no other remedy in nature for their misfortunes, and therefore hope his excellency will not refuse them, that if Catalog a has merited any thing by its servicesr and by its conjunction with the English nation, this is the time to receive the fruits of it; that it is worthy of his excellency to comfort the flicted, and not to deny thein this favour in their great necessity;

How the admiral was affected with this letter may appear by one of his to lord Bingley, dated August the 7th, (No. 70.) wherein he acquaints bins, That Mr. Grimaldo had signified to him from the king of Spain, that all the king’s ships of war being employed before Barcelona, 'bis majesty could not send any of them to meet his flota then coming home; and therefore desired the admiral to send three of his upon that service, which was accordingly complied with. Of this be had acquainted lord Bolingbroke, and hopes to meet with her majesty’s approbation. -

The Catalans thus abandoned, and given up to their enemies, contrary to faith and honour, were not however wanting to their own defence, but appealing to heaven, and hanging up at tbs high altar the queen’s solemn declaration to protect them, underwent the utmost miseries of a siege, during which, what multitudes perished by famine and the sword ! How many have since been executed ! And'how many persons of figure are still dispersed about the Spanish dominions in dungeons, is too well known to need any relation.

It is hoped however, that the calamities of the Catalans will not be imputed to Great Britain in general, abused by the ministry, with repeated assurances, that every thing was doing for the'preservation of that unfortunate people.

The Committee find frequent notices and mention made of the Abbot Gaultier, who, although he does not appear to have had any public character, resided in England during the 9

greatest part of this negotiation, and upon extraordinary occasions, was very often sent backward and /orward.

But the share that he had in the more-public transactions, was not his only business. It is evident, that some negotiations, which required more than ordinary privacy, were verbally transacted; and upon all such'occasions, Abbot Gaultier was the person to whom the French and English ministers mutually referred each other.

And as of necessity nothing could be a greater secret than all, matters relating to the pretender, this province was particularly allotted to Abbot Gaultier, tlftt through his hauds, >nd under his conveyance, by French couriers going continually betwixt France and England, such practices might be carried on with great safety, which in any other ipanner had been too dangerous an undertaking.

. The first time that any secret negotiation is expressly referred to Abbot Gaultier, is found in a letter already taken notice of, where Mr. St. John, March the 4th, 1711-12, tells M. de Torcy, He had deferred writing to him of late, till he might write with certainty, till the necessary dispositions were made among our people at home, and till the queen had taken the only resolution which could bring us in a short time to a good and solid peace. “ I have now the aadsfaction to tell you, that this resolution is taken, and tha(; Mr. Harley will carry with him this night, or tomorrow morning, the final instructions of the queen ro her plenipotentiaries I refer myself to M. Gaultier, to explain to you oore at large the subject of this gentleman's commission, and what the queen hopes his roost Christian majesty will do to co-operate with her."

- The Committee having observed, at the beginning of this report, that several letters and papers are wanting, which, by the circumstances of time and matters then depending, appear to be of moment and consequence; it is hot to be expected, that, those who have been so careful to suppress matters of less importance, would leave behind them any transactions that might tend openly and directly to favour and support the cause of the pretender.

But as the Committee has observed several passages whichr are a plain indication o£ the tenderness and regard with which the cau$e and person of the pretender were treated, as often as mentioned; they have thought fit to bring them together, and lay them before the house in one view.

There is a paper that was left in lordBoling-broke's closet, dated at Versailles, the 24th of September; 1711, endorsed, as other office papers usually are. It gives an account, that the pope’s nuncio had in his last audience of the king made the following declaration. “ Tbq.court of Rome being fully informed, that Fiance was endeavouring to procure a peace wpon. the most advantageous.terms that was possible, and being persuaded, that if the; peace should be made, England would not suffer that

the king of France .should permit the prince of' Wales to continue in his realms; the cuurt of, Home offers to the king of France to give this prince aiuasylum at Rome, or in any other part of the ecclesiastic dominions.”

To which the king of France returned in Answer, That an asylum for the prince of Wales would be no obstacle to the peace. That if the allies did truly design te make a peace, he. would accept of any reasonable propositions they should make; and in this case an article, for the prince of Wales would be inserted in the treaty. . '

June the 7th, 1712. The bishop of Bristol giving an account to lord Bplingbroke of some discourse he had with some of the ministers of. the allies, says, Mons. Consbruck, one of the emperor’s plenipotentiaries, kept also within the terms of decency, save only that he took k for granted, that one great end of all this management on our part, wds to bring in the pre-_ tender; which apprehension one of the ministers of the States lately owned in private discourse, to have been the fundamental reason of all their.conduct of late.”

It cannot be forgot what great stress and weight was laid upon the removal of the pretender out of the dominions of France. This, was what all the nation with great justice expected, and what the queen declared was taken care of, as an additional security to the protestant succession.

But his removing out of France, and being permitted to reside in Lorrain, was not only a-great surprise to all the nation, hut was received with such just indignation, that the parliament addressed the queen, upon, this occasion. That she would iusist upon his removal from Lorrain, that residence being equally or more dangerous to Great Britain, than his abode in France. Her majesty’s Answer, That she-would repeat her instances, occasioned in the, House of Lords a becoming resentment, that, the duke of Lorrain should presume to receive and entertain the pretender to her majesty’s, crown, in defiance of her majesty’s application to the contrary. But it will now appear in what manner the removal of the pretender out of France was transacted and settled, and that his residing in Lorrain was not only with the approbation, but even by the direction and appointment of the English' ministry. Mr. St. John, in his letter to M. de Torcy, of the 24th of May, 1712, O. S. when he sent him over the conditions upon which her majesty would make those important and decisive declarations to. parliament, concludes that letter with saying, “ He hopes, that, with the general repose we shall see revived in a few weeks, a good under-, standing between two nations, which may become to each other the most useful friends, for the same reasons they have been the most formidable enemies. The queen commands me to tell you, that she hopes when you send an Answer to thisdetter, we shall have, an account that the chevalier had begun his journey.”

In answer tp this, M, de Torcy says mjr

Ixxxvii] APPENDIX. — Report reUting the [lxkxviii

lord Bolingbroke, u Yoo may assure the queen that the chevalier is ready to depart at a moment’s warning, if he did but know where he was to go, and in what place he might be in safety. I own to you, that I know no prince who is willing to receive him, for fear of displeasing the queen, or other powers; it will be absolutely necessary, that there should be some explanation upon this subject, which I desire you to make to me by the abbot Gaultier, if you do not judge it proper to do it yourself.” Mr. St. John, on the 6th of June, 1712, O. S. writes a public letter, in answer to the several points contained in M. de Torcy’s last letter; but in that letter takes no notice at aH of the chevalier;

But the day after, June the 7th, 1712, he 'Writes a private letter, as he, calls it himself, to M. de Torcy, and conclude* it with saying, “ The abbut Gualtier will write to you upon the subject of the 'chevalier.”

The Committee observe, there are two copies of this private letter, one delivered by my lord Bolingbroke, the other entered 'in lord Strafford’s book:and in the copy of this letter given in by lord Bolingbroke, this passage, That abbot Gaultier shall write about the chevalier, ” is omitted by his lordship.

On the 22d of June, 1712, N. S. M. de Torcy writes two letters to my lord Bolingbroke. In the public letter nothing is said of the pretender; the private letter concludes with saying I have the honour to send you a letter, under the king’s hand, for her Britannic majesty; and I refer you to what the abbot Gaultier shall say to you, about the departure of the chevalier.” '

On the 21st of August, 1712, lord Bolingbroke being then in France, to give the finishing stroke to all matters of consequence that Were undetermined, in his dispatch to the earl Of Dartmouth, giving an account of his proceedings at the court of France, says, the chevalier has fixed his departure for the first of next month, N. 8. They propose that he shall retire to Bar; fand they intend to write to the duke of Lorrain to ask of the emperor; and other princes, a security for his person during his residence in that place.

But on the 28th of December, 1712, N. S. it*appearsthat the chevalier Was still in France, pon which account Mr.' Prior writes thus to my lord Bolingbroke. “ Another point npou which this court is very solicitous, is, that the chevalier remaining ia any town of France obstructs the signing the peace: yet he cannot go to Lorrain till the emperor’s passports will secure him there. Your lordship, by the perusal of the papers, will seethe 6tate of that case; and I have only to add upon this subject, that the court of France expresses an Impossibility on their side, to db more than they have done, and hopes we should have interest enough with the emperor, to obtain such passports from him, ' as may secure, as well the person who is to go into Lorrain, as fee duke of Lorrain, who is to receive him.

Mr. Prior on the 29th, writes to the same effect to my lord treasurer^ and says, “ the monarch is a good deal troubled Upon rhia head, lest the young mad should fall into the hands of the Hussars or Barbarians. AndM. de Aumdnt has, I presume, orders to speak to our ministry.upon it.

* As to the dowry, I shall not only be dunned to death, but hanged; for the ridwager sends messengers to me, which you in England .do not think it extremely lawful to receive: bat if it is to be paid, pray let it be done in an handsome manner, that may shew the charity of the queen, and the generosity of her lord treasurer.”

The papers referred to in Mr. Prior’s letter, contafn an account of what the duke of Lorrain bad done, at the desire of the king of France, to obtain from the allies the necessary safeguards for the chevalier. He says that understanding that the queen of Great Britain had already granted her safeguard or protection to the chevalier de St. George, he believed they had no more to do, but to apply to the emperor, and to the States General.

By this account it is evident, that abbot Gualtier was the person entrusted to manage the affairs of the pretender, with whom such practices were verbally to be transacted as our ministry did not think proper to commit to writing. It appears, that the place to which he was to go, because nobody would receive him at the hazard of the queen’s displeasure, and where he might remain in safety, was to be prescribed from England: that this was no* fixed and determined till lord Bolingbroke went into France. And. if his lordship’s instructions are considered, it will be hard to find in them any thing of that importance and secrecy, as to requre his going in person tb settle it. His lordship gives an account from thence, that the pretender was to go to Bar; and this is acquiesced in here without the least objection made. The ministry are told by Mr. (Prior, that the court of France hopes by our interests such passports would be procured as might secure his person: and in the paper sent to France from the doke of Lorrain, it is asserted, that the queen of Great Britain had already granted her protection to the pretender.

But November the 6th, 1713, lord Bolingbroke writes to Mt. Prior, arnd says, “ Her majesty having repeated to the duke of Lorrain the instances which yoo know have been so often made to the most Christian king, for removing of the pretender to her crown out of his dominions, I am directed to acquaint you therewith, that you may speak to the minister of Lorrain, and to any other minister whom you shall think proper, and let them know it is absolutely inconsistent with the amity and good correspondence that »'between the queen and1 their masters, to receive hito their dortoini-ous, dr to protect a person, Who disputes her majesty’s most undoubted title, and thereby endeavours to disturb the peace and quiet of her kingdoms. That you may be ahlr io shew

lxxftix] APPENDIX^iVirgorialforM/or Peace: 1715. {xe

them that this if the collective sense of the whole nation, as well as the queen’s command to you, I herewith send you the addresses of both Houses of Parliament.

This can be understood as no more than a bare compliance with the qd^lresses of parliament. And to shew ho* little resentment aid indignation was conceived against the duke of Lorrain for this indignity offered to her majesty, the Committee have thought fit to transcribe a letter that was wrote by lord Bolingbroke to Mr. Prior, within four days after his last mentioned letter upon the subject of the pretender.

" This letter, ” says lord Bolingbroke to Mr. Prior, “ will be delivered to you by the baron de Forstner, who has been twice at our court with the character of envoy from the duke of Lorrain, and who is extremely well with your friends on this side of (he Water, that I make no doubt but that he will be a welcome acquaintance to you. I roust at the same time recommend the interest of the duke of Lorrain his master to your care. You know, Sir, bow little that prince has yet felt the good effects of what was stipulated for him at Ryswick. You know, Sir, how justly he pretends to an equivalent from this emperor for the Montserrat, which was given away from him to the king of Sicily. In a word, you arc enough apprised of his wants, of his expectations, and of her majesty’s earnest desire, rf by any means she can, to contribute to the ease, and to the advantage of a prince, who observes much better usage than he has on many occasions met with.”

There are several other letters that were wrote after the address of parliament to press the removing of the pretender from Lorrain; but after what has been said, it is needless to observe what little effect was to be expected from such representations made in the several courts t of Europe, which were known to he Contradictory to the sense and intention of the court of Great Britain. And if any further demonstration was wanting to shew their true spirit and inclination, it may be observed that the addresses in parliament were made in July, 1713:and the first letter that lord Bolingbroke wrote, in pursuance of those addresses was the 6th of November, which was four months after the addresses were presented to the queen.

The Committee think it not improper to insert here an extract of a memorial touching the demolition of the sluices of Dunkirk, delivered by M. de Torcy to lord Bolingbroke «t Paris, in August, 1718.

It is not our business now to examine whether the queen of England, and the English nation, were in the right to demand the demolition Of die fortifications, and the filling up the harbour of Dunkirk: that is a thing resolved and agreed upon. It may perhaps come to pass in the course of this affair, for reasons easily to he fomeen. That England shall repent having demanded the demolition of a place, and the destruction of On harbour, tffitch

might be of great use in conjunctures which perhaps are not very remote.”

Your Committee do not take upon, them to explain What conjuncture France had in view, and which they thought not very remote, when Dunkirk might be of particular service; bat think it proper to conclude this part of the report with observing, that the pretender did, immediately upon the demise of the late queen, publish a declaration, which the duke of Lorrain has acknowledged in his letter of the 6th of December, 1714, that be received from the pretender himself; wherein is this remarkable passage:"Yet contrary to our expectations upon the death of the princess our sister (of whose good intentions towards us, we could not for some time past well doubt; and this was the reason we then sat still, expecting the good effects therebf, which were unfortunately prevented by her deplorable death) we found that our people, instead of taking this favourable opportunity of retrieving the honour and true interest of their country, by doing us and themselves justice, had immediately proclaimed for their king a foreign prince, to our prejudice, contrary to the fundamental and incontestable laws of hereditary right, which their pretended acts of settlement can never abrogate.”

The Committee observing in the eleventh volume referred to them, a Letter from the earl of Oxford and Mortimer, then lord high treasurer of Great Britain, to the queen, dated June 9, 1714; together with an account of public affairs, from August 8, 1710, to June 8, 1714, all written with his own hand, and sent to thequeen with the letter; and finding therein ihanylpasssges, in their opinion, highly deserving the consideration of this House, have thought it necessary to insert the same here at large and are as follow > *

A brief ACCOUNT of public Affairs since August 8th, 1710, to this present 8th of June; 1714. To which is added, the State of Affairs abroad, as they relate'to this kingdom; with some humble proposals for securing the future tranquillity of her Majesty’s reign, and the safety ofher kingdoms.

Her majesty en the8th of August, 1710, was pleased to alter her treasury, and two days after, in a new commission, Robert Harley, by her majesty’s great favour, was made chancellor of1 the exchequer.

The state of affairs at home and-abroad are fresh in every one’s memory.

The condition of the treasury at that time was laid before her majesty in a large representation.

I beg leave to touch some few heads. The army was in the field; no money in the treasury; none of the remitters would contract again; the bank had refused to lend 100,000l. to lord Godolphin on very good security; the navy, and other branches of service, 11,000,000l. in debt, which enhanced the price of every think proportionably; the civil list in debt about 600,000l., and the yearly income too little for the current certain expenee, by the lowest computation 124, 495/. 2s. 4

In a few days this new commission made provision for paying the army by the greatest xemittance that had ever been known; though the opposition from every office which was full of persons who were enemies to the change made by the queen, was very strong, and very troublesome and vexatious; and such was the situation of affairs, that nothing but great patience could ever have overcome these difficulties; it being impossible as well as unadvisable to make removes, but by degrees.

As soon as it was possible, (and notwithstanding, the clamours then raised, it was the only proper time) a new parliament is called.

Its first meeting was November 27, 1710. Robert Harley had prepared the funds ready (before the parliament met, as he .had done every session to this day) not only for the current service of the year, both by sea and land, but also for easing the nation of above nine millions of debt. . This was thought so chimerical when Robert Harley did begin to open it, that it was treated with ridicule, until be shewed how practicable it was. It is true, this gave great reputation abroad, and enabled to treat advantageously of a peace:It raised sinking credit at home, but at the same time as it drew envy upon Harley from some, and the rage of others; so it gave offence to somfe of 'bis fellow servants, who told him plainly that he ought to have told his secret, and if he would not get money himself, he ought to have let his friends share 100,000l., *which would not have been felt or found out in so vast a sum as 9 or 10,000, (WO.

To this principle was owing the setting on foot at this time, the unhappy voyage to Canada; to all; which meetings Harley avoided

coming, and gave lord Rochester his reasons; and after he desired his lordship to be a means to the queen to hinder that expedition; but it -happened to be too late. But lady Masbam knows how much Harley was concerned nt it, though he did not know the true spring of that' tfoyage, which will apear after in this paper.

The beginning of February 171(M1, there, began to be a division amongst those called Tories in the House, and Mr. Secretary St. John thought it convenient to be listing a separate party for himself.

To prevent this lord Rochester and- Harley desired to have a meeting, and to cool such, rash attempts; and it was contrived Mr. Secretary St. John should invite us to dinner, (which was the last time he ever invited Robert. Harley, being now above three years,) where was the duke of Shrewsbury, Earl Poulet, lord Rochester, and. othersand lord Rochester took the pains to calm the spirit of division ao4 ambition.

Harley was at this time seized by a violent fever, and on his first coming abroad, March 8, met with a misfortune which confined him many weeks. The transactions during that time are too public, as well as too black, for Harley to remember or to mention. '• .

In the end of May, 1711, the queen, out of her abounded goodu'ss, was pleased to confer undeserved honours ou Robert Harley; and on the 29th of the same month, was pleased to put the treasurer’s staff into his bauds:A post so much above Harley’s abilities to struggle with, that he had nothing but integrity and duty to recommend him to her majesty’s choice: so he must have recourse to her majesty’s transcendent goodness and mercy to pardon all his faults and failings, both of omission and commission, during the whole coarse of his service.

But to return and resume the thread of this discourse. The 4th June 1711. Three days after the treasurer was sworn, he was surprised with’a demand of 28, 036/. 5s, for arms and merchandize, said to be sent to Canada. When the treasurer scrupled this, Mr. Secretary St. John, and Mr. Moor came to him vyith much passion upon this affair; and about a fortnight after, the secretary of state signified the queen’s positive pleasure to have that money paid; and accordingly her majesty signed a warrant June.-21st: and the treasurer not being’able then, with all his precaution, to discover further light, the money was paid July 4, 1711.

Since the-return from that expedition, the secret is discovered, and the treasurer’s suspicion justified:For the public was cheated of above 20,000l.

There is reason to be more particular upon this head, because it is one of the things never to-be forgiven the treasurer; and lord chancellor told him more to that purpose; that they told him no government was worth serving, that would let them make those advantages, and get such jobs.

. One thing more is craved leave to be added,

kciiij APPENDIX. — Negoiiaticms for Peace: 1715. [*cif

That the treasurer was forced to use all his skill and credit to keep the House of Commons from examining this affair last parliament.

June the 12th 1712. The first session of last parliament ended.

From this lime, to the beginning of the next session, the treasurer’s hands were full of negotiating the Peace in all courts abroad; and besides the ordinary and necessary duty of his office at home, he had frequent occasion of calming the quarrels and grudges Mr. Secretary had sometimes against lord Dartmouth, sometimes against lady Masiiam, and sometimes against the treasurer himself.

The second session of the last parliament began December.the 7th, 1711.

This was attended with great difficulties and dangers, as well from the practices of the discontented here, as the designs carried on by Mr. Buys, prince Eugene, and Bothmar; in which designs concurred the emperor, and other states and princes who gained by the war.

This put her majesty under a sort of necessity to preserve the whole, ' and to take a method which had been used before, to create some new peers.

So many having been brought formerly out of the House of Commons of those who used to manage public affairs, it was proposed to Mr. Secretary, That if he would be contented to stay in the House of Commons that session, her majesty would have thefgoodness to create him a peer, ’ and that he should jiot lose his rank.

The second session ended the 21st of June, 1712; and notwithstanding Bothmar’s memorial, and all other attacks- both from abroad and at home, sqpplies were provided, and every thing relating to the public' put upon a good foot; and the malecontebts began to despair, as appeared by the duke of Marlboro.ugh .retiring abroad, and other particulars.

After the session was ended, the queen, as she had promised, ordered a warrant for Mr. •Secretary St. John to be a viscountthis happened to put him in the utmost rage against the treasurer, lady Masham, and without sparing the greatest. It did avail very little fo tell him how much he had got in place; for had he been created with the other lords, it would have fallen to his share to come next after lord Trevor; but the treasurer with great patience bore all <the storm, of which lord Masham was often a witness of the outrageous speeches; and Mr. Moore very lately told the treasurer, that lord Bolingbroke said very lately to him, that he owed him a revenge •upon that head.

This discontent continued, until there happened'an opportunity ofseuding him to France; of which there was not much occasion:but it was hoped, that this would have put him in f; ood humour; which it did, until in Ootober 1712, there were knights of the garter made. This created a new disturbance, which is too well remembered, and breaks out now very often in outrageous-expressions publicly against all then made.

In November, on the death of dake Hamilton, he was" much against duke Shrewsbury’s going, for reasons very plain, which were then-in negotiation; for before the lastsession of that parliament began, a new model was framed, or a scheme of ministry; which how they afterwards came to fall out, will appear iu its due place.

The 3rd and last session began April the 9-th, 1713; which was as soon as the peace was concluded, and could be proclaimed.

It is not decent to take notice, That during this whole negotiation, the treasurer was obliged by his own hand, and his own charge, to correspond in all the courts concerned in the negotiation; and very often he had the ' good luck to set right several mistakes, and-to obtain some things very little expected; but the bnly merit of this belongs to her majesty, the credit of whose favour brought it about, and gave power to the treasurer to act with success.

During this session, the lords of the cabinet, and others, met every Saturday at the treasurer’s, in' order to carry on the queen’s business, as they had done the year before on Thursdays. Many offers were made, and repeated by the treasurer, in order to attack former offenders, and quiet- the minds of the gentlemen, and of the church party; and the only reason for this failing, was, because of the project laid for their new scheme; and putting themselves at the head, as they called it, of the church party *

This being the last session of parliament, and some gentlemen fearing their elections, and some for other reasons, dropt the bill of commerce.

The treasurer saw this opportunity, and immediately took it, and prevailed with sir Thomas Hanraer, and others, to come into the payment of the civil list debts, incurred- before the change of the treasury, though the present treasurer was j-ailed at, and maligned; which he chose to bear patiently, rather than own the true reason, that there was no money to do it with, which would have ruined all at once.

This step of paying the debts, put the male-contented into the utmost rage, which they did very publicly express iu both Houses.

This last session’of that parliament, and the third since the change ef the ministry, ended July the 16th, 1713.

The peace with France being over, and it growing necessary to put her majesty’s affairs into a further and more settled regulation, and to ease the treasurer of the burthen, as well as envy, of such a bulk of business; her majesty was pleased to approve of the scheme of the duke of Ormond’s staying here to 'attend the army affairs, which was necessary at the time of disbanding; duke Shrewsbury to go t!o Ireland, upon his return from France r lord Findlater to be chancellor of Scotland; lord Mar third secretary; lord Dartmouth privy seal, and Mr. Bromley secretary of stater, and sir William Wyndham Chancellor of tbt

xctj APPENDIX.- )/* relating tptkp fxcv#

Exchequer. I am sura the queen very wall remembers the rage this caused, as perfectly defeating their scheme, and shewing that her majesty would put her affairs on a solid foot; the lord chancellor said it was against law, and to this day will not treat lord Findlater with decency; and lord Mar has met with many ill treatments as well as Mr. Secretary Bromley.

But that the treasurer'might leave them without excuse* and make her majesty’s affairs, if possible, easy with and to those in her service; as sopn as be was recovered enough to write, he wrote a' large letter to lord Bolingbroke, containing his scheme of the queen’s affairs, and what was necessary for lord Bolingbroke to do, as belonging only to his province. This letter was dated July the 25-th, 1713, and was answered July the 27th, by lord Bolingbroke; the copy was shewn to lady Masham, who came to visit the treasurer then coufined to his chamber; and she then thought it was a very good one, and what was proper for the occasion. 1 believe the whole would be of use to give light to her majesty into the ground and foundation of the follies and madness which have since appeared; the whole is ready for her majesty’s perusal when she pleases.

In this letter the treasurer gives cm account to lord Bolingbroke of the occasions, or rather the pretences, for giving disturbance to the queen’s servants. He proposes the remedy, and what was requisite to be done by him as secretary in his own province, and also assurance of the treasurer’s assistance to the utmost, and of his desire to consult with him (lord Bolingbroke) how to unite the rest of our friends.

Being then sick, the treasurer took the liberty to put lord Bolingbroke in mind of the several particulars which then required dispatch, and were solely belonging to his province, without any other interposition than that of takipg your majesty’s direction.

Amongst others, that of a circular letter upon the addresses of both Hoases relating to the pretender.

This was not doue in three months. His lordship wrote word it was done July the 37th.

In toe same letter the treasurer proposed, that (according to the treaty of peace) care should be taken of the following particulars, viz. Newfoundland, JdudsonVbay, Acadia, St. Christophers, Assiento, and other things contained in the treaties of commerce.

These particulars the treasurer .thought to have been executed, until within a few weeks be heard the contrary by accident, and that the time in the several treaties was elapsed. Upon this, the treasurer, on Wednesday, June the 2d, told Mr. Moor of this, and that every body would be liable to blame who are in cite queen’s service. Thursday, June the 3d, 1714, lord Bolingbroke writes to the treasurer a letter which begins thus.

Mr. Moor has been this morning with me, and has put ioto my hands a paper, which be calls, I think* not improperly* a charge upon

This paper contains the neglect above-mentioned ip the treasurer's letter of July the 25th* 1713, eleven months before; and yet these faults are now charged upon fte treasurer.

The Committee cannot but observe, that his lordship lias here taken to himself the credit of corresponding by his own hand, and his own charge, in all the courts concerned in the present negotiations, and that very often he has had the good luck to set right several mistakes, and to obtain some things verjr little expected. That: he boasted of his laying hold of a seasonable opportunity in parliament, upon rejecting the bill of commerce, to prevail with members of that House of Commons to come into the payment of the Civil List Debts: and has also charged several persons, then in high stations in her majesty’s service, with corruption and im-hezzlement of the public money; and presumed to recommend himself to her majesty, by having nsed all his skill and credit to keep the House of Commons from examining into the same.. And yoyr Committee having received information, that laige sums of money had been directed for special services relating to the war, by signs .manual apd warrants upon the same, countersigned by his lordship, which sums were afterwards paid to his Jordsfeip’s order; your Committee thought it incumbent upon them to lay before the House, copies of the said sign* manual, and warrants, and orders thereupon, together with extracts from the register of the exchequer; whereby it will appear, that these large sums, issued for the service of the war, were received and applied to his lordship’s private use. _ v

Your Committee in drawing up and forming this Report, having observed several transaction *, orders, and directions, given by the ministers in the queen’s name, which are in no manner agreeable to her majesty’s sentiments and intentions, as expressed in her several messages to parliament, and speeches from the throne, concerning the terms of peace which she waa pleased to communicate to both Houses; thought it their duty to enter into a particular examination of this matter, and to compare her majesty’s declarations with the measures that her ministers presumed to take in carrying oa these important negotiations.

The first timet that the queen made any mention of the peace to the parliament, was Oo December 11, 1711, at which time nothing had been concluded between England and Frauce, but the special preliminaries that were signed by the earl of Dartmouth, and Mr. St. John, on the part of England, and M.

After these preliminaries were signed, Mr. St. John had pressed M. de Torcy, that the king of France would explain himself with regard to the allies; begs that the queen may kaf esom *

explication of hit intentions in respect to the particular interest of the allies, and concludes with qaying, If the Sieur Gaultier returns with these marks of confidence, you will see our parliament as much inclined to peace as ever it-was to war.

Such explications as the king of France thought fit to make, are contained in the answer to the memorial brought by M. Gaultier, Nov. 18, 1711, inserted in the Appendix. Upon which her majesty, at the opening of that session, in laying before the parliament the state of the treaty then on foot, according to the Advice and Representation made to her by her ministers, said, “ That notwithstanding the arts of those who delight in war, both place and time are appointed for opening the treaty of a general peace. Our allies, especially the States general, whose interest I look upon as inseparable from my own, have, by their ready concurrence, expressed their confidence in me.”' The queen thought the States had readily concurred with her; but it must be remembered, that the States had in the strongest manner represented against the propositions signed by M. Mesnager, as two general and uncertain, not being a sufficient foundation upon which a negotiation might be hazarded; they dreaded the fatal consequences of opening the general conferences, before the articles offered by France were made specific, and before they knew what they were to trust to for their own barrier and their commerce. These representations were made in Holland to the earl of Strafford; and Mr. Buys was sent over into England to enforce them here.

But instead of acquainting the queen with these representations, or acting according to her majesty’s sentiments, Mr. St. John, Oct. 9th, declares, “ Certain it is, that her majesty is so far determined in her measures, that those will deceive themselves who may imagine by delay to break them.” And Oct. 29th, “ The queen remains firm in her first resolution, of causing the Conferences to be opened upon the articles signed by M. Mesnager.” And Nov*. 2d, “ The queen will not finally concert a plan for the prosecution of the war with the States, until they join with her in agreeing to open the conferences of peace.” And Nov. 15th, lord Strafford says, he had now told them her majesty’s order to him was to declare, that she should look upon any delay as a refusal to comply with her propositions. By these threats and extraordinary measures, the States arc compelled by the queen’s ministers' to consent to open the conferences: when at the same time/her majesty was persuaded, that they readily concurred in what had been proposed to them. I^er majesty declares, she loolts upon the interest of the States general to be inseparable from her own. Mr. St. John declares, That Britain had gone so much too far in weaving her interest into that of the conti-, nent, that it would prove no easy task to disentangle them without tearing and rending.

The queen says further, « The princes and

voi.vn.

[xcviii

* States which have been engaged with us in ‘ this war, being by treaties intitled to hare ‘ their several interests secured at a peace, I ‘ will not only do my utmost to procure ever/

* one of them all reasonable satisfaction, but £

‘ shall'also unite with them in the strictest en-

* gagements for continuing the alliance in

* order to render the general peace secure and 1 lasting/ ' And in her message of the 17th January following, her majesty again expresses ‘ the care she intended to take of all her allies,

‘ and the strict union in which she proposed to ‘join with them/

By these declarations it appears, her majesty’s own resolution was to unite with the allies in the strictest engagements. But her ministers had taken upon them, in the private propositions sent over by Mr. Prior, to insert an article, that the secret should be inviolably kept between England and France, till allowed to be divulged by the consent of both parties. And although France, in the first propositions sent over by M. de Torcy, had offered to treat with England and Holland, either separately or jointly with the rest of the allies, at the choice of England, the queen’s ministers excluded the allies, and iq the conference held with M. Mes-negar, they are much surprised to find that he had orders to insist, that the queen should enter into particular engagements, upon divers articles, which depend not upon her, and which regard the interest of the alfi<“s:And they insist that it was absolutely necessary to remit the discussion of the particular interests of the allies to general conferences. And when Mr. St. John was pressing M. de Torcy to give them some explications of what teas designed for the allies, he assures him, “ If the king would offer a plan of specific preliminaries, the queen will never communicate it to her allies/ And upon another occasion, he declares ‘ this negociatioo was begun and carried on, upon a supposition that the queen must desist from many conditions which in rigour she was obliged to procure for her allies/

In the message of the 17th of January the queen declares, ‘ Her plenipotentiaries had

* begun, in pursuance or their instructions, to ‘ concert the most proper ways of procuring a ‘just satisfaction to all in alliance with her, ac-

* cording to their treaties, and particularly

* with relation to Spain and the Indies/ Ana her majesty had said before, in answer to an Address from the' House of Lords, presented 11th December, 1711, ‘I should be sorry any

* one could think t would not do my utmost

‘ to recover Spain and the Indies from the house ‘ of Bourbon. (

Your committee cannot make the least doubt but her majesty was determined to recover Spain from the house of Bourbon. But that her ministers had no such thoughts, and did not in the least endeavour it, appears in every part of thenegociation. In the first propositions sent Over by Mr. Prior, demands are made of the king of France, to be performed by the king of Spain, which the king of France was \%

engage for. And as appears by an entry in, lord Strafford’s book, Mr. Prior had orders to see if they had full powers from Spain. In the special preliminaries, an acceptation whereof was sighed by the earl of Dartmouth, and Mr. $t. John, September 27th, 1711, it is said ex-ressly, the king promises, in the name of the ing of Spain his grandson, and according to the powers which his majesty has received from that prince, that Port Mahon and Gibraltar shall remain ta the English. These steps had been taken by the^qdfeenY ministers, even before her Majesty had made these declarations; which the committee cannot therefore but conclude her majesty was not informed of. And although the queen’s plenipotentiaries were obliged by their instructions to insist, that Spain and the West Indies should not be allotted to any branch of the House of Bourbon; when the plenipotentiaries of France, on the 11th February, 1711-12, gave in their specific ex-lanation of the general preliminaries, signed y Mr. Mesnagar, the king of France made his first offers in the name, and by virtue of powers from his grandson king Philip, as king of Spain. On 4th Maich, 1711-12, atameeting of the ministers of the allies at Utrecht, where they were to communicate to each other their respective demands; count Zinzendorff insisted, that the restitution of the whole Spanish ' monarchy should Be expressly mentioned: upon which occasion it appears, by a letter from the English ministers of the 6th March, that they were the only ministers that did not snake any mention at all of Spain, and that they were sensible of the disadvantageous consequences of being so; but being desirous to take off this odium, they make a general declaration concerning the just and reasonable satisfaction for the queen’s allied, in conformity to their alliances; and humbly hope what was $aid will not be found contrary to what has been hitherto declared.

All the attempt that the queen’s ministers ever made towards obtaining this great point, Which, her majesty declares, she should be sorry any one could think she did not do her utmost to procure, was to demand assurances that the crowns of Frdnce and Spain should never be united. The method of preventing thi^ union was never mentioned by the queen’s ministers in order to be treated of, uor the sense of France and Spain ever asked upon it till the latter end of March, 1712.

/ In this message her majesty further adds, 4 The world will now see how groundless those

* reports are which have been spread abroad

* by men of evil intentions to serve the worst designs, as if a separate peace had been treated,

* for which there has not been the least colour

* given. ’

In this declaration, her majesty is advised by her ministers, in order to clear them from the just suspicions which all the world had conceived of the separate measures they were engaged in, not only to declare there had not been the least colour given for such jealousies, but

to brand all that entertain such apprehensions, with the character of men of evil intentions, that had the worst designs to serve. But that most just cause had been given for these reports is sufficiently evident from what was just now observed. The ministry had insisted that the secret should be inviolably kept between England and France, exclusive of all the allies. A separate negociation between England and France had been carried on by papers sent backward and forward, and much time spent therein, as is said in lord Strafford’s instructions. Mr. Prior had been sent into France, and Mr. Mesnegar had been in England, and not the least communication was given for five months together to any of the allies of these transactions, which were depending from April

1711, to September following, from the time that the first proposals, signed by M. de Torcy, were sent to the States, till the seven general preliminaries, signed by Mr. Mesnegar, were communicated to them. When these general preliminaries were signed, which were sent over as a foundation to open the general conferences, a set of special preliminaries between England and France was signed on both parts, which were concealed, publicly disowned, and never appeared till this inquiry; and all these transactions had passed, however disguised to her majesty, before the time that her ministers .advised the queen to impose so grossly upon the nation, as to declare in parliament, there had not been the least colour given for these surmises.

Her majesty is advised here to declare, that to report that a separate peace had been treated, proceeds from evil intentions, and to serve the worst designs. But your committee observe, that after this declaration of the queen’# her ministers propose to France, agreed with France, and sent positive and repeated order# to the queen’s plenipotentiaries, not only to treat, but to conclude a separate peace, with France. On the 20th June, 1712, Mr. St. John acquaints M. de Torcy, the queen will make no difficulty to conclude immediately a separate peace with France, leaving the allies a time- wherein they may have liberty to submit to such conditions as' shall be agreed upon between the queen and the most Christian king, “ In Answer to this M. de Torcy tells Mr. St. John, upon condition the queen does immediately make a separate peace, and keep no measures with her allies, the king has determined to send his orders to permit the English troop# to enter into Dunkirk. On 12th July, 1712, Mr. St. John thinks the queen in a condition not to lose a moment’s time in concluding with the ministers of France the convention for a. general suspension of arms both by sea and land, and even the treaty of peace between Britain and France. And on the 4th August,

1712, M. de Torcy acquaints Mr. St. John, that the king consented to the duke of Savoy’s having Sicily upon certain conditions, wherein one express condition is, that a peace be concluded between England, France, Spain, and

.ei}- AWENDIK.^ — Negotiations for Peaces 1715. [cii

Savoy. And at last, when the treaty drew near to a conclusion, and almost all the allies were ready to sign; on the 20th February, 1712-13

* positive orders are sent to the British plenipotentiaries to conclude and sign with France: and on the 28th lord Bolingbroke repeats his orders to the British plenipotentiaries to conclude/ and sign with .France; and acquaints them, the duke of Shrewsbury had declared, That their lordships had orders, in case the French complied, as they now have actually done, to sign her majesty's peace with France without further delays and that his grace had also declared, that in this case her majesty would open the parliament, by telling them that she bad made a peace with France; these two considerations, his lordship says, were perhaps, the most prevalent inducements to the French court to pome roundly into her majesty’s propositions.

Your Committee think they cannot close this head better than with repeating a passage from one of lord Bolingbroke’s letters to Mr. Prior, wherein he says, If such overtures as these were not instantly accepted, our separate peace would, sitting this parliament, be addressed for, made, approved, and the cause of France . for once become popular in Great Britain/

On the 6th June, 1712, the queen says, . I am now come to let you know upon what terms a general peace may be made.

On the same day, lord Bolingbroke acquaints M. de Torcy, that though the king of France had not answered the queen’s demands according to expectation, the queen would not defer going that day to parliament, and making all the declarations that were necessary to render the nation unanimously inclined to the peace.

- The queen says, The difficulties had been

* increased by other obstructions, artfully con-

* trived to hinder this great and good work/ Whereas it is notorious, that the ministers had received but the day before, the account that king Philip had consented to make^ the renun-1 ciation, upon which account only the queen’s speaking to the parliament had been deferred.

The queen says, I have not omitted any

* thing which might procure to all our allies

* what is due to them by treaties, and what is

* necessary for their security/

Lord Bolingbroke. on the very same day, in his letter to M. de Torcy, sayg ', “ lord Strafford is going back to Utrecht; and the instructions lie is to carry will put the queen’s plenipotentiaries in a condition to keep no longer those measures to which they have hitherto been obliged to submit; but from henceforth they may openly join with those of France, and give law to them who will not submit to just aud. reasonable conditions/ ’

The queen says, ‘Nothing has moved me

* from steadily pursuing in the first place the

* true interest of my own kingdoms/

Lord Bolingbroke just before, on the 24th of May, had proposed to M. de Torcy, that the queen being much more intent upon the ge-

neral peace, than ?ny particular advantages, commissaries should be appointed to settle, after the peace, such points relating to trade, as required a longer discussion than the present crisis would admit.

The queen says, ‘ That to prevent the union ‘ of the two crowns, she would, not be content ‘ with what was speculative, but insisted upon

* something solid / Although M. de Torcy had before declared to the queen’s ministers, That to accept of this expedient which they proposed, would be to build upon a sandy foundation.

The queen says, ‘ The nature of the proposal ‘ for a renunciation is such, that it executes ‘ itself; and that France and Spain are thereby ‘ more effectually divided than ever/ But M. de Torcy had before assured the queen’s ministers, “ That this renunciation would be null and void, by the fundamental laws of France; and they would deceive themselves who accepted of it as an expedient to prevent the union of the two crowns.

The queen says, Provision is made, that' < the same privileges and advantages as shall be

* granted to any other nation by France, shall ‘ be granted in like manner to us/ But it appears by a letter of lord Bolingbroke’s, in January following, to the duke of Shrewsbury, that France refused to let our trade stand upon the foot of ‘ gens amicissimadeclared th? tariff 1664, which was granted to the Dutch, except the four species, was too beneficial lor us; and refused to grant it until another tariff should be made in Great Britain exactly-conformable to that of 1664, whereby our duties would be reduced as theirs are in France by that tariff.

As to our commerce with France, the queen says here, June the 6th, 1712, ‘ It was in a me-‘ thod of being settled/ And Mr. Prior says of it in May following, near a twelvemonth after, “ We had like to have made an Atha-nasian business of it at U trecht, by that explanation of our own way of understanding our own commerce. Their letters to you, full of surmises and doubts, that all was unhinged; and their letters to us again, that explanations, however made, were only to save appearances, and signified nothing: this meslange, ’ I say, and my endeavouring to understand it, had, like to make me run mad, if the duke ofShrews-bury’s extreme good sense, and M, dd Torcy’* not only honest but right understanding, had not redressed us/ ’

The queen says, “vThe French consented to/ deliver up New foundland and Placentia.” But it must be remembered, that in the preliminaries signed in September preceding, the French had reserved to themselves a liberty of taking and drying fish in Newfoundland.”

The queen says, An absolute cession was-

* to be made of Nova Scotia or Acadia/ But cape Breton, which was always understood to be, and is so declared by the queen’s instructions to the duke of Shrewsbury, to be part of Nova Scotia, is expressly given up to France.

Dig y

«iii] APPENDIX. — Report relating to the[ciT

The queen says, The trade to Spain and the West Indies may in general be settled, as

* it was in the time of the date king of Spain,

* Charles the Second/ But when the project of the treaty of commerce came from Madrid, lord Bolingbroke says of it, “ They had seut a blind, lame, misshapen, indigested monster, instead of that fair offspring which we. had reason to expect from our candour/ ’

If all the other parts of this speech be Strictly jammed, it will be found that the ministry did so grossly deceive the queen, injorder impose upon the parliament by her authority, that there is scarce a paragraph that does not Contain some unfair, or at least equivocal representation of the state of the negotiations. And when the queen was advised by her ministers to make this communication to parliament, as the terms upon which a general peace might be made, it is very evident, they had no assurances 'that France would make good what they prevailed upon the queen to declare in so solemn and public a manner. For on June the "11th, 'the bishop of Bristol is directed by Mr. St. John to discourse with the ministers of the allies, agreeably to the plan contained in her majesty’s speech; but before his lordship makes-this step, Mr. St. John tells him, “ It will be proper that he speaks first with the French plenipotentiaries upon this subject; whether they will be willing, and in what manner they will be willing to give this communication to the allies/’ In answer to which, the bishop of Bristol writes word, June 28th that the French plenipotentiaries declared they bad no such orders, and without them they could not do it; And in this refusal of owning the queen’s speech, as containing their master’s offers, and in absolutely denying to treat, upon it, the French plenipotentiaries persevered, even after the Dutch had consented to treat upon that plan, and to accept the queen’s speech p*o materia tractandi.

[The Committee having proceeded thus far in the perusal and examination of the books and papers referred to them, thought it hot proper to defer this report until they had perfected what remains, especially upon the affairs of Dunkirk and the Assiento: In which they have made such a progress, that they hope they shall in a short time be able to lay them before the House.]

Gertraydenbei^g; and that before the opening of the campaign, he still gives new proofs , of the desire that he has always preserved to procure the re-establishment of the repose of Europe: But after the experience he has made of the sentiments of those who now govern the republic of Holland, and of their industry to render the negotiations fruitless, he is willing, for the public good, .to address to the English nation the Propositions that be thinks fit to make to end the lyar, and firmly to secure the general tranquillity of Christendom.

It is with this view, that the king offers to treat of peace upon the basis of the following conditions.

1. That the English shall, have real securities to exercise their commerce hereafter in Spain, to the Indies, and in the ports of the Mediterranean.

2. The king will agree to form in the Low Countries a sufficient barrier for the security of the republic of Holland: and this barrier shall be agreeable to England, and to the good liking of the English; his majesty promising at the same time an ir.tire liberty and security for the commerce of the Dutch.

3. .Reasonable means shall be sincerely and

bond fide sought out for, to satisfy the allies of

England and Holland.

4. As the good state of the affairs of the king of Spain furnishes new expedients to end the difference touching that monarchy, and to regulate it to the content of the parties interested, sincere endeavours shall be used to surmount the difficulties raised on this occasion, and to secure the state, the commerce, and generally the interests, of all the parties engaged in the present war.

5. The conferences to treat of the peace upon the basis of these conditions shall be immediately opened; and the plenipotentiaries that the king shall nominate to assist thereat, shall treat with those of England and Holland alone, or jointly with those of their allies, at the choice of England.

6. His majesty proposes the cities of Aix la Chapelle and Liege for the place where the plenipotentiaries shall be assembled, referring it to England to choose one of those two cities to treat therein of the general peace. Given at Marli the 22nd day of April, 1711.

XjETTER from Mr. Secretary St. John to the Queen, dated Sept., 1711.

Madam; The lords of the committee of council met this morning at the Cockpit, and directed the earl of Dartmouth and myself to confer with iftons. Mesnager.

We saw him accordingly this evening at Mr. Prior's house} where my lord treasurer and my lord chamberlain, were likewise present.

He has put into our hands the answer signed by the king of France to the demands last sent over by your majesty’s order, and this answer complies with every article, except the 8tb, relating to North-America; we find however, that wt shall be able to compound this

point, in the manner which your majesty soma time ago resolved to pass it in, provided FrauCe gave you satisfaction upon the 7th article, as she has now intirely done.

The propositions which are to be sent into' Holland, as the foundation of’a general treaty, we have likewise received from him, and that, which was thought the most liable to objection, has been very much mended. My lord treasurer having however proposed some further’alterations, in order to make the whole the more palatable abroad; and Mons. Mesnager seeming inclined to agree to them; I am this night to draw them into form for my lords of the council to consider to morrow morning.

This, madam, being the present situation of. the treaty, your servants are unanimously of \ opinion, that the warrant and full powers should be prepared this night, and transmitted to your majesty; by which means, if it be your pleasure, the latter may pass the great seal tomorrow.

It is now so extremely late, and I have so much business to do, which must of necessity be got ready by morning, that the whole night would not suffice, if I was to ingross the instrument in my own hand writing; I therefore make use of a clerk to transcribe them, but it is the same who has copied all the papers which have passed in the course of this negotiation.

There comes ah exact translation of the full powers in this pacquet; the words, of which are very ample and extensive, but they are agreeable to the form used by your majesty upon such occasions.

My lord treasurer moved, and all my lords were of the same opinion, that Mr. Prior should be added to those who are impowered to sign; the reason for which is, because he having personally treated with Mon&. de Torcy, is the best witness we can produce of the sense in which the general preliminary engagements are entered into; besides which, as be is the best vefrsed in matters of trade of all your majesty's servants who have been trusted in the secret, if you shall think fit to employ himin the future treaty of commerce, it will be of consequence that he has been a party concerned in concluding that convention, which must be the rule of this treaty. The rest of the plenipotentiaries are all those who have the honour to sit in your majesty's cabinet council, which my lords understood to be your majesty's pleasure.

TheOstend mail which arrived last night, brought no news. — I am, with the utmost respect, &c. H. St. John.

The Answer of France to the Preliminary Demands for Great Britain more parties larly.

The king being particularly informed, by the last memorial that the ministers of great Britain returned to Mr. Mesnager, of the dispositions of that crown, to facilitate the general

evil] APPENDIX. — Report relating [oviii

peace to the satisfaction of all the parties interested in the present war; and his majesty plainly seeing, as the diemorial sets forth, that he can run no risque by engaging himself in the manner therein expressed, since the preliminary articles will not have any effect before the signing of the general peace; desiring more* over very sincerely to dp all that is in his power to advance the re-establishment of the repose of Europe, especially by a way so agreeable to his majesty as the interposition of a princess will be, wham so many ties of blood should unite with him, and whose sentiments for the public tranquillity cannot be doubted:His majesty, moved .with those considerations, hath ordered the Sieur Mesnager, knight of his order of St. Michael, deputy to the council of commerce, to give in writing the following answers to the articles contained in the memorial which was sent to him, intitled, Preliminary Demands for Great Britain more particularly.

Preliminary Demands for Great Britain more particularly, with the

Art. I. The succession to the crown of these kingdoms, according to the preseut establishment, shall be acknowledged. —

His majesty will acknowledge the queen of Great Britain in that quality, as also the succession to that crown according to the present establishment.

II. A new treaty of commerce between Great Britain and France shall be made, after a most just and reasonable manner. — Ans. The

. king consents to make a new treaty of commerce with Great Britain, after the most just, most reasonable, and mostadvautageous manner to France and Great Britain.

III. Dunkirk shall be demolished. — Ans. Though Dunkirk has cost the king very great

sums of Money in purchasing as well as for-. tifying it, and that a very considerable expence will still be necessary to raise the works; his majesty is however willing to engage that they shall be demolished immediately after the conclusion of the peace, upon condition that an equivalent shall be given him to his own content, in lieu of the fortifications of that place; and as England cannot furnish the said equivalent, the discussion thereof shall be referred to the conferences held for the negotiation of the general peace.

IV. Gibraltar and Port Mahon shall remain in the bands of those who now possess them. — Ans. The king promises in the name of the

king of Spain his grandson, and according to the power that his majesty has received from that prince, that Gibraltar and Port Mahon shall remain in the hands of the English who now possess them.

V. The Assiento contract shall be made with the English after the same manner that the French now possess it; and such places in Spanish Amen<& shall he allotted to those in-

terested in the said commerce, for the refreshment and sale of their negroes, as shall be thought necessary and convenient. — Ans. The English shall have, after the peace con- eluded, the treaty of negroes of Guinea to the West Indies, alias, the Assiento contract, upon the same conditions that that convention was made by the king of Spain with the French:So that the company which will be established for this effect in England shall have the prerogative of refreshing, vending, and selling, theif negroes, in all the places and ports of America upon the North sea, in that of Buenos Ayres, and generally in all the places and ports wherein the importation was permitted to the ships of the company formed in France'under the name of the Assiento.

VI. All the advantages, rights and privileges ', which are already granted, or which shall hereafter be granted, by Spain to the subjects of France, or of any other nation whatsoever, shall be likewise granted to the subjects of Great Britain. — Ans.The king promises, for

himself, and for the king of Spain, pursuant to the power which is in his majesty's hands that this article shall be granted in case the peace be concluded, as the foregoing, and that it shall be punctually executed,

VII. And for the better protecting the commerce in the Spanislt America, the English shall be put in possession of such places afc shall be named in the treaty of peace.

France having offered a real security for the commerce of the subjects of the queen of Great Britain in the Spanish America, it was. never doubted but France thereby meant some places; and we have been confirmed in this opinion, since France bath proposed Gibraltar as a security for the commerce of Spain and of the Mediterranean. The advantages and the privileges offered by the Sieur Mesnager, are not to be regarded as real securities, because, it will always be in the power of Spain to resume them: Therefore it is believed that France is obliged, either to cause to be yielded to Great Britain the places demanded in this article, or to procure it new advantages, such as the love ot peace may make it accept as an equivalent. Upon which we think*ourselves obliged to insist, that this minister be furnished with a sufficient power. And further, to testify the sincerity wherewith we treat, and the desire that her majesty of Great Britain hath to advance the general peace; she hath thought fit to declare, that the difficulty arisen upon this article may be removed, in granting to her the following articles.

That the Assiento contract he made with Great Britain for the term of thirty years. — Ans. Though the king of Spain, in the beginning of his reign, was inclinable to favour the French nation, having occasion for supplies of money to relieve his country from an impending war; this prince, notwithstanding these considerations, granted but for ten years to the French, the privilege of th«

fix]

treaty of negroes:it would be very much in favour of the English to leave in their hands for twenty years a prerogative, which it seems all the nations of Europe would each enjoy in their turn. Yet the king promises^that the king his grandson shall yield to the English, during thirty years successively, the treaty of negroes of Guinea to the West Indies, alias, the Assiento contract, upon the same conditions, prerogatives, and privileges, granted to the French company, and which they enjoyed, or ought to have enjoyed, since the first of May, 1702, to this time. — The king shall grant this article.

That the whole Island of St. Christophers be secured to Great Britain.

That the advantages and exemptions of duties promised by the Sieur Mesnager, and which he pretended amounted to 15 per cent, profit upon all, merchandizes of the growth and manufacture of Great Britain, be effectually granted to that kingdom. — His majesty romises likewise, in the name of the king of pain, the advantages and exemptions of the duties whereof mention is made in this article; and which the English shall enjoy immediately after the conclusion of the peace, at the exchange of the ratifications.

Great Britain may refresh their negroes at Jamaica, and there make a distribution of those whom they shall send to Vera Cruz, Porto Bello, and other factories in that part of the Indies: But as on the sidfe of the river de Plata, they have no possession of any colony, they demand that there be assigned to them in that river, some extent of land, upon which they may not only refresh their negroes, but keep them Safe, until they be sold to the Spaniards. And as no artifice is intended in making this demand, they will submit themselves, in this respect, to the inspection of the officer that shall for this purpose be named by Spain. — Ans. The general peace being made, there shall be assigned to the English company of Assiento an extent of land in the river de la Plata, upon which they may not only refresh their negroes, but keep them safe till they be sold, according to the conditions which shall be stipulated by the convention which is to be passed for the Assiento; and to hinder any abuse of this permission,

the king of Spain shall name an officer to intend the affair, to whose inspection the interested in the said company, and generally all those they shall employ in their service, shall submit themselves.

VIII. Newfoundland, the bay and streights of Hudson, shall be entirely restored to the English; Great Britain and France shall respectively keep and possess all the countries, dominions, and territories in North America, which each of those nations shall possess at the time that the ratification of this treaty shall be published in those parts of the world.- — The discussion of this article shall be referred to the general conferences of the peace, provided

[ex

that the liberty of fishing and drying of codfish upon the isle of Newfoundland be reserved to the French.

In the execution of the orders of the king* we the underwritten knight of his order of St. Michael, deputy to the council of commerce, have adjusted the present answers to the preliminary demands for Great Britain, in number eight articles, by virtue of the power of his ma-. jesty, of which we have furnished a copy signed with our hand, and promise in the name of his said majesty, that the said answers shall be looked upon as conditions that he agrees to grant, of which the articles shall be reduced, into the ordinary form of treaties, and explained after the most clear and most intelligible manner, to the common satisfaction of France and Great Britain. And this in cas? of the signing of the treaty of the general peace. In witness whereof we have signed, and put the seal of our arms. Given at London, 27 Sept. (8 Oct.) 1711.

his power to the ro-estahfishroent of the general peace, his majesty declares,

1. That he will acknowledge the queen of Great Britain in that quality as also the succession to that crown, according to the present establishment, i 3. That he will consent voluntarily and

fide, take all just and reasonable measures to hinder the crowns of France and Spain from being ever re-united upon the bead of one and - the same prince, his majesty being persuaded .that this excess of power would be contrary to the good, and to the general repose, of Europe.

3. The king’s intention is, that all the parties

engaged in the, present war, without excepting any, may hod their reasonable satisfaction in the treaty of peace to be made; that the com- ' inerce be re-established, and be hereafter supported to the advantage of Great Britain, Holland and other nations, which have been accustomed to exercise it. '

4. As the king is also willing to maintain exactly the observation of the peace, when it shall be concluded; and that the view his majesty proposes to bhnself is to secure the frontiers of Jiis kingdom, without troubling in any manner •whatsoever, the neighbouring states, hejpromises -to agree by the ftiture treaty of peace, that the Dutch shall have in their hands the fortified places, which shall be specified, in the Low -Countries, to serve hereafter as a barrier, which may secure the repose of the republic of Holland, against any attempt on the part of France.

5. The king also consents, that there be formed for the empire, and for the House of Austria, a sure and convenient barrier.

6. Though Dunkirk hath cost the .king very great sums of, money, as well to purchase as to fortify it, and that a considerable expence will still be necessary in order to rase the works thereof, his majesty is nevertheless willing to engage to cause them immediately to be demolished after the conclusion of the peace, upon condition that there be given him for the fbrtifi* .cations of that place, an equivalent agreeable,

and to his own content: and as England cannot furnish the said equivalent, the discussion thereof shall be referred to the conferences to be held for the negociation of the peace.

7. When the conferences for the negociation -of the peace shall be formed, all the pretentions of the princes and states engaged in the present war shall be bona fide and amicably discussed thereat; and nothing shall be omitted to regulate and ro conclude them to the satisfaction of all the parties.

By virtue of the king's fall power, we the underwritten knight of his order of St. Michael, deputy to the council of commerce, have, in his majesty's name, settled these preliminary articles. In witness whereof we have put to our #eal. Given at London, SI Sept. (8 Oct.) 1711.

Her Majesty's Instructions to the Earl of Straffordt Ambassador, &c. to the States General. October 1, 1711.

Upon your arrival in Holland, (whither yon are to repair with all possible diligence) you shall take the first opportunity of conferring with the Pensionary, and of informing him* that we have sent you back as soon as some matters of the greatest monrtent were ripe and fit to be laid before our good friends and allies the -States General.

You are to represent to this minister, and t such others as shall be appointed to confer with you, That when we received, in the month of May last, by your dispatches to us, an account of the sense which those among them, who were at that time in the secret, had of the overtures made by France for settling a general negotiation of peace again on foot, and of the answer which it was desired might be returned to the propositions signed by M. de Torcy, we did immediately acquaint the enemy, that their offers were thought by us, and by the States General, neither particular nor full enough, .and therefore we did insist that they should form a distinct project of such a peace as they were willing to conclude.

You are further to inform the Dutch ministers that this affkir being transacted by papers sent backward and forward, and much time being lost in this dilatory method, we did at last think fit to send to the court of France, ih order to have from thence some more certain account of the disposition towards peace, and of the terms on which they might be willing to make, it. '

That the French did hereupon send over a person with, powers to treat and to settle some preliminary articles tb a general negotiation.; but that this person being neither fully instructed, nor sufficiently empowered, a still further delay was created, and it became absolutely necessary to allow him to send to his court for (H)

ext] '• APPENDIX. — Report relating to the [cxti

more ample instructions; we being determined on our part, according to the desire of the pensionary, and of the other ministers, to leave nothing undone which might bring the French .to be more direct and particular in their overtures.

You are to communicate to the pensionary and to the ministers you confer with, the paper herewith delivered to you, 'signed by M. Mes-nager, an old acquaintance of theirs, and one with whom they have formerly treated; representing to them, that though the several articles do not contain such particular concessions as France must, and to be sure will make, yet they are in our opinion, a sufficient foundation whereupon to open the conferences.

That we were unwilling to take upon ourselves to determine the several interests of our allies, and did therefore resolve to content ourselves with such general offers as might include all the particular demands proper to be made in the course of the negotiation, during which it-must be the most careful endeavour, and the fixed principle of all the confederates, to hold ‘fast together, in order to obtain from the enemy the utmost which can be hoped for in the present circumstances of affairs. And this rule you may assure them, that we shall on our part firmly adhere to.

If upon this, or upon any other occasion, the ministers of Holland shall express their uneasiness, lest we should have settled the interests of these our kiugdoms, in a future peace, by any private agreement; you are to say, that we have refused to suffer the treaty to be carried on in our own country, and that we shall still contipue to do so, unless they constrain as to take another measure: that by this means, the Dutch, and all our allies, " will have the opportunity and convetiiency of treating and adjusting their different pretensions, in promoting of which we shall exert all that zeal tor the common good, and for their particular advantage, which we are sure they do us the justice to confess that we have shewn through the whole course of our reign.

You will further say, that you can take upon yourself to assure them, that we have made no Stipulations for ourselves, which may clash with the interest of Holland; that those articles which we expect should be inserted in the future treaty of peace, for the particular interest of Great Britain, are for the roost part Such as contain advantages, which must either continue to the enemy, or be obtained by us. And also, that no concessions whatsoever can tempt us to embrace the blessing of peace, unless our good friends and allies the States General have all reasonable satisfaction as to their barrier, as to their trade, and in all other respects.

These assurances being given in our name, you are to insinuate strongly to the ministers of Holland, how just reason we should have to / be offended, and to look on the proceeding between them and us ns very unequal, if they should pretend to have any further uneasiness

upon this head i. and we being determined to accept of no advantages to ourselves, repugnant to their interests, nor of any peace which may not he to their reasonable satisfaction; that the figure which we have made through the whole course of this war, and, the pert which we have acted in it, superior to what any of the allies, even those who are nearest to the danger, and in interest most deeply concerned have done, might justly entitle us, if we should so think fit, in the first place, to adjust and settle the particular concerns of Great Britain, before we should consent to set the general negotiation on foot.

If those engagements, which we are undev by our treaties, of making no peace, but in concert with them, or the particular obligations of the barrier treaty, are objected to you, you are to say, as to the first, that we have not in any sort Acted conrtry thereto; that we are so far from making a peace without their concurrence, that we have declared our firm resolution not to make, it without their satisr faction; and that all that has passed between France and us, amounts to no more than an introduction to a general negotiation: as tQ the latter, you will represent very earnestly to them how much it is for the interest even of Holland itself, rather to compound the advantage; of the barrier treaty, than to insist upon the whole, since it is notorious, the House of Austria, and several other of the allies, are, and must necessarily continue, utterly averse to it; and since you may yourself assure them, upon the observation which you have made during your stay here, that nothing can be more odious to the people of these kingdoms, than many parts of this treaty; and that nothing ha^ prevented that national, and universal indignation which would have broke out upon this occasion but the great care and industry which has been used to calm the minds of those who are acquainted with the terms of this guarantee, and to keep the same as secret as possible from those who are not yet apprised of them. You will expostulate further with the ministers of Holland, by shewing the absolute necessity of entertaining a good harmony between the two nations, upon which not only their mutual safety in a great measure depends, but without which, there can at no time be formed a strength sufficient to reduce any exorbitant power, and to preserve the balance of Europe; and upon this foundation, you will argue, that it is the true interest of neither country to insist on any conditions which may give just apprehensions to the other.

You -are to acquaint them. That France proposes Utrecht, Nimighen, Aix la Chapelle, and Liege, as places in any one of which the conferences may with conveniency be held; that we have refused to let the general treaty be carried on in our own country, and that wq are ready to send our plenipotentiaries to such of these four towns as may be mo$t agreeable to them.

You are to conclude your conference by desir-

cxviij, APPENDIX. — Ndg<tfMft«w/or Peace: 17151. [cxVifl

ing (hat they will give all possible dispatch to the choice of a place of. treaty, and that the pa9s-

Eorts to the French plenipotentiaries may be astened, it being in our opinion of importance so to forward the progress of this great affair, that on one hand we may not be exposed to begin too late the preparations for the next campaign, nor on the other to put ourselves to an expence, which in case the general treaty proceeds, will be unnecessary.

And whereas not only the Dutch, but the imperial and other ministers, may perhaps deny the paper herewith delivered to you, to be a sufficient ground for opening the conferences upon; and may insist that France should consent to preliminary articles in the nature of those formed, and on the part of the allies signed in 1709; you are in the first place, besides what is in these your instructions before directed, to insinuate, that the French might very probably have been brought to explain themselves further had they not perceived the extraordinary uneasiness, impatience, and jealousy, which during their transactions with us, discovered themselves among our allies.

You are afterwards in our name, to declare to them, that they are- desirous to carry on the war, and determined to accept of no terms of peace inferior to those which have been formerly demanded, we are, on our part, ready to Concur with them, and to continue to sacrifice the blood and treasure of our subjects, as we have hitherto done, for their greater advantage and security; but that we are in justice bound neither to deceive ourselves nor, them; and do therefore, by you our ambassador and plenipotentiary, solemnly declare, that we can no longer bear that disproportiooable burthen which has every year been encreased upon us, nor that deficiency which our allies in every part of the war are guilty of. That it is evident that the common effort^ must be still greater 'against the enemy than it is, or that-there will remain no prospect of arriving at those ends which are proposed; that therefore it is incumbent on them, if the war be continued, to furnish for the future such quotas of ships and forces, as they are at this.time wanting in, and to encrease their expence, whilst we reduce ours to such a proportion as in reason and in justice bodi should be settled at. '

If on the part of the ministers of Vienna, and of Holland, their inability to do more than they have hitherto done, be urged in answer to you, our pleasure is, that you finish by saying that we think that we may justly insist that they should comply with us in wap, or in peace, since in the former case we require nothing but what it belongs to them to perform, and what is essential to the success of ourarms; and since in the latter we have done, and to the last shall continue to do, all that is in our power towards obtaining such a peace as may be to the satisfaction of all our allies.

Extract from the Register of the Resolutions of their High Mightinesses the States General of the United Provinces, on Saturday the

24lh of Octoberf 1711.

It having been deliberated upon what tho -earl of Strafford, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of her majesty the queen of Great Britain, has represented to the coun* sellor pensionary Heinsius, in order to be coin* municated to their high mightinesses, and On the preliminary articles delivered on the part of France, to come to a general peace, also communicated to the counsellor pensionary Heinsius: It has been thought proper, and agreed upon, that the answer to he given to the earl of Strafford, shall be, that their high mightinesses, having examined the said articles with all possible attention, have found them couched in terms 60 general dnd obscure, as to deserve great consideration; and. that they have strong apprehensions, «that by entering upon them into a formal negotiation, the affairs of the peace will be subject to many delays, incertainties, and other great inconveniences, which their high mightinesses earnestly desire may be avoided, that a speedy, good and general peace may be the sooner come at. That for this reason their high mightinesses have ordered the Sieur Bays, who is going to England in quality of their envoy extraordinary, to communicate to her majesty their fears and thoughts upon this subject; and thereupon to represent to her majesty, That they judge it necessary in so important an affair, in which, having themselves no other aim but the advancement of the common cause, and the mutual interests of both nations, they firmly rely upon the great wisdom, and the so much renowned zeal of the x]ueen for the common good, that upon the representations to be made to her on this subject, she will he pleased to make such reflections, as the States believe an affair of sox great consequence to the safety and the public good deserves:the said earl of Strafford is also desired, that he will be pleased to contribute to this purpose by his good offices.

No. 10.

A Memori M. Gaultier, Hampton-court, October 29, 1711.

The queen has proposed by the earl of Strafford the opening of the conferences:the States General answered, they did hot look on the memorial her majesty had sent them as a sufficient foundation on which they might venture upon a negotiation. Wherefore they bad deferred proceeding any further in that affair with the said minister, until they knew what effect the remonstrances had, which Mr. Buys their envoy extraordinary was ordered to make to the queen thereupon.

The said envoy has represented to her majesty, That the States are ready to concur with her to facilitate the general peace, but that they belieVe it is hazarding too much to open the conferences, unless the general article offered by France be explained and specified.

Her majesty, who has always foreseen, and .who still foresees, how impossible a thing it would be to bring the allies to agree on 'a plan of particular preliminaries, and who remains firm in her first resolution, to open the conferences on the articles signed by M. Mes-nager, has given M. Buys her final answer on that head, That she looks on those articles as containing in general all the pretensions her allies can reasonably fornd; That she still persists in the same opinion: she renews her orders to the earl of Strafford, to repeat his instance with the States General* to induce them to choose one of the four places that have been appointed for the place of congress; and tp oblige them likewise to dispatch passports for his most Christian majesty’s plenipotentiaries.

Things being in this situation, her majesty thinks, in order to the speedy opening of the conferences, and for the greater dispatch of the work of the peace, it will be absolutely requisite, the most Christian king should give her majesty such explanations of his designs, with . respect to the particular interests of the allies, as lie shall think fit, to induce them to enter snore willingly into a general negotiation.

The Dutch aim at nothing but their barrier, and their commerce, and provided the queen Can, without fear of being disowned, specify, Within a small matter, the barrier which France is willing to yield to them; and that she may assure them of the tariff of 1664, there is no room to doubt but the States General will enter, without any difficulty, into the negotiation as it has been concerted. '

The duke of Savoy’s ministers are alarmed for their barrier towards France. The queen thinks it would not only be for the quiet and Security of'Italy, that this prince should be tnade more powerful on that side; but her majesty would he likewise very glad if she could give him some assurances concerning a barrier for his country towards France :• And her majesty looks on that article to be so essential; that she hopes the answer will be as favourable, and as particular, as k possible.

9

The Dutch and the duke ef Savoy being agreed on those heads with her majesty, the greatest difficulties that may be raised, to delay the general peace, will presently be removed, and the conferences forthwith opened.

There are several pretensions of the other allies included in the general promise of a reasonable satisfaction, that must be examined and settled in the course of a negotiation; as those of the king of Prussia, and those of the Electorate of the duke of Hanover, on which, if the queen was authorised to give assurances On the part of France, it would be attended with this good effect, That those powers would presently come into her majesty’* views and measures.

There is no room to doubt, after all the steps her majesty has already made, but she has a sincere desire to procure the general quiet of Europe; and if her majesty desires that the most Christian king would give an explanation to the aforesaid demands, and to such others as might happen concerning the particular interests of other confederated princes, his most Christian majesty may be assured, the queen will make no other use of the confidence the king will have in her, but to forward the negotiation, in seeking the shortest and most effectual means to attain a peace so much wished for, that will be honourable to his most christiarf majesty, and secure and equitable to the confederates. 1

Answer to the Memorial brought by M.

Gaultier. Nov. 18, 1711.

The King sees with pleasure, that the queen of Great Britain persists with that firmness worthy of her, in the desire she has expressed of using the most speedy and effectual means for attaining an honourable peace to France and Great Britain, and which may be at the same time both safe and equitable, with respect to the other powers engaged in the present war. His majesty intending also to confirm.by deeds, the assurances he has given of the confidence he has in that princess, his majesty thinks he cannot better express his sentiments, than by captaining himself on the points of this memorial, with as much frankness as if the peace was made, and as if there was already a strict alliance between him and the queen of Great Britain.

So without considering that there has been no mention made hitherto but of preliminary articles, and that the queen of Great Britain does now desire explanations on the particular conditions which are to form the treaty of peace, the king is willing to entrust her, as A prinpess in amity with him, with his thouglrts on the detail of the chief conditions of the peace.

He is willing, as he has already declared, that the Dutch should have a barrier sufficient to secure the tranquillity of their republic.

He is willing also that trade be restored and maintained for the future to their advantage, provided they will concur bond to the re* establishment of the peace.

CJtkiJ

As to the barrier, it would be necessary, before it be settled, to agree upon the destination of the Low Countries, as the king of Spain has -yielded them to the elector of Bavaria, and that the king has signed the 'treaty thereof; if it should not be fulfilled, the elector would have his recourse to his majesty to be indemnified. He will therefore desire, that the Dutch should put into the hands of the elector of Bavaria, the towns and provinces possessed by them, or their allies, in the Spanish Netherlands, so as that prince may possess the same in sovereignty after the peace, in like manner as he nbw •possesses the towns and provinces of Luxemburg and Namur, and the places of Charleroy and Nienport: the king will promise, that, on condition of this cession, the Dutch shall put garrisons into the strong places of the Low Countries, which shall be paid and maintained at the eipence of the country; so that those provinces, being possessed by an independent prince, and garrisoned by Dutch troops, wifi form a barrier, which alone would be sufficient to secure the republic of Holland against any reasonable apprehension of the designs of France.

But the better to secure the States General against those vain fears, the king is willing to 'engage his word to the queen of Grfeat Britain, still to strengthen that barrier, by quitting and yielding to the Dutch the town of Menin, with its verge, in giving them Ipres and its chastel-lenie; but it must be observed that Cassel, Poperingue, and Baitleul, do not make part thereof, and. therefore his majesty reserves them to himself.

In short, by yielding further, with the same regard to the barrier, Furnes and the Fnrn Am bach. These are the cessions the king is willing to make for the good of the peace; but then these are the only ones his majesty can •grant, unless he would leave open the frontier of Iris kingdom.

As- his majesty is persuaded, that neither the intention nor the interest of the queen of Great Britain ate, that France should remain naked, and always exposed *to the designs of her enemies; his majesty expects to be strongly supported by England, in the demand be makes of the restitution of the towns of Aire, Bethune, St. Venant, Douay, Bouchain, and their dependencies, which he pretends to obtain by way of compensation for tire places be yields, to form the barrier demanded by the Dutch.

He still renews the promise of demolishing, immediately after the conclusion of the peace, all the fortifications of Dunkirk, as well towards the land, as towards the sea, without any exception:and as it was settled between the king and the queen of Great Britain, that a .'fitting equivalent should be given for this demolition, his majesty demands Lisle and Tottrnay, with all their dependencies and chastellenies, to form the promised equivalent.

Tonrnay is the ancient domain of the kingdom; it forms the frontier of it; and it must fee looked open as a place of safety to Fiance,

rather than an inlet into the neighbouring country: the king cannot receive a more public obligation from the qtieea of Great Britain, than if she will contribute to the restitution of a place so necessary for securing the frontier of his kingdom. On the other band, it is iudif-ferent to England, whether this place returns, as formerly, under the king's dominion, 'Or whether it remains in the hands of a foreign power; and the interposition of the queen of' Great Britain, by her good offices on this occasion, will cement, for the future, a most strict union between the crowns of France and England.

However, if her majesty's good offices should prove fruitless, notwithstanding her best endeavours for procuring to his majesty the restitution of Lisle and Tournay, as an equivalent for the fortifications of Dunkirk, his majesty declares from this present time, but .only to the queen of Great Britain, that for the good of the peace, he will be satisfied with the restitution of the town and citadel of Lisle, with the chastel-leny and dependencies, without insisting on Tonrrtay; being willing to content himself with this last equivalent, rather than to retard, by more extensive, thpugb just pretensions, the reestablishment offhe tranquillity of Europe.

The cession of the Catholic Low Countries was made by the king of Spain to the elector of Bavaria, only with a design to indemnify him for the losses he suffered during the course of this present war; but his majesty, and the king his grandson, are further engaged' by treaties with that elector, to restore him, by the peace, to the possession of his dominions, of his rank, and of his dignities, whereof he was deprived by the war; so his majesty .will demand, that this prince resume in the electoral college the first rank, which tvas transferred to the elector Palatine; that the upper Palatinate, given to the said elector Palatine, be restored to the elector of Bavaria; and in short that the dismemberments made from the chief parts of the same electorate, be annulled, And things restored to their former order.

Even these demands are not repugnant to the interest of the Dutch, supposing that they will consent to leave the low countries to the elector of Bavaria: for it is consistent with their maxims, that these provinces should be possessed by a prince, whose power secures their barrier.

However, if they have different thoughts with respect to the elector of Bavaria, and that, forgetting the first engagements of that prince with the House of Austria, they are persuaded that his ties with France will never be weakened; if upon this foundation, they think that his power might at any time be dangerous to their state, and that therefore it is necessary to diminish the same; regard may be had to this fear, although ill grounded, by proposing for the good of the peace, to engage the elector of Bavaria to yield Bavaria, and the electoral dignity, to the prince his eldest son; whereof it would be decenary -to conclude at the sane

APPENDIX.- — /or Peace: 171

time the marriage with the arch dutchess* eldest daughter of the late emperor Joseph. In this case it should be stipulated, that the elector would be satisfied to possess the Low Countries instead of Bavaria, with the condition that has been mentioned, of putting Dutch garrisons into the places to be paid and maintained at the charge of the country.

If these proposals should be rejected, the king, being engaged by his treaties to take care of the interests of a prince’s ally, demands that at least the elector of Bavaria may keep the provinces of Luxemburg and Namur, and that his electorate, his dignity, and his rank, may be restored to him; but it would not be just, that being reduced to two strong places in the Low Countries, he should be ohliged to receive a Dutch garison therein, which the revenue of those two provinces would not be able to maintain. This condition must be struck out; which the Iking only proposes in case all the Low Countries be intirely given to the elector of Bavaria.

As the king doubts not, but the queen of Great Britain thinks it just, that the elector Palatine should restore the upper Palatinate, his majesty thinks, that the duchy of Limbnurg might be separated from the Low Countries, and given to the elector Palatine, .to indemnify him for the upper Palatinate, which he should restore; this his majesty leaves to the prudence and justice of the queen of Great Britain. However it be, it might be agreed, that the elector Palatine should enjoy, during his life, the upper Palatinate, and the first rank in the electoral college, and that after his death, both should return to the elector of Bavaria, and his successor.

This second proposal, with respect to the elector of Bavaria, would bring no alteration to the offer already made, of yielding to the Dutch for a barrier, Meoen, Ipres, Furn and Purn Ambach, on the conditions beforementioned.

But the manner in which they will use this prince, will decide the advantages the king will grant with respect to trade.

If one of the preceding proposals is accepted, the king's intention is to re-establish, in favour of the Dutch, the tariff of 1664, with the exemption Qf the duty of 50 per tun; Lis majesty will particularize only some exceptions to this tariff, whereof the detail is contained in a memorial by itself: he thinks himseilf obliged to stipulate the same, not only to prevent the utter ruin of trade, the navigation, and the manufactures establised in his kingdom, but also to take away the equivocations that might hereafter occasion complaints, and troublesome disputes.

If it happens ou the contrary, that the proposals made in favour of the elector of Bavaria be rejected, that he be obliged to content himself with the single restitution of Bavaria perhaps dismembered from the upper Palatinate, and the elector be deprived of the brstrank in the electoral college; in this case,

[exxir '

his majesty will only grant to the Dutch tha tariff signed in May 1699.

There would still be another indemnization more honourable, but far less useful, and which his majesty would nevertheless pay, at the same rate z>f the re-establishtnent of the tariff of 1664, with the exceptions mentioned.

The Dutch, and their allies, by refusing the Low Countries to the elector of Bavaria, would probably have the same yielded to the arch-, duke; The king will consent thereto, and moreover, his majesty will dispose that elector to yield the whole electorate of Bavaria to the house of Austria, provided the kingdom of Naples be given to that priuce.

The proportion is not equal between that kingdom of the one, , and the Spanish Netherlands on the other part, with a country like that of Bavaria, and so convenient to the house of Austria; but the king undertakes to supply the loss of the elector of Bavaria, and to make by the indemnization, England a considerable gainer.

The means his majesty proposes to succeed therein, is, by engaging the king of Spain to yield Sicily to that elector, so by possessing both kingdoms, be would be indemnified for what he should forsake otherwise, and the English would find their particular advantage in the conventions England might make with him for the opinmerce in the Mediterranean. It is not indifferent to the nation to be secure of the prince who shall be master of Messina, and the Dutch would easily prevent England, if ever Sicily should fall into the hands of the archduke. This reflection will not have e^ caped the wisdom of the queen of Great Britain, who shews likewise her regard to the affairs of Italy, by the article which concerns the duke ofSavoy.

The king's intention is, punctually to perform the convention signed in his name, by M. Mesnegar, in relation to that prince. His majesty will acquaint him therewith directly, since the quedtl of Great Britain desires it. The silence his majesty has kept upon this subject, was grounded upon this, that his majesty has no correspondence, either directly or indirectly, with the duke of Savoy, be referring himself to that princess to instruct him with what was stipulated for him.

For what remains, the king is so far from opposing the aggrandisement of the duke of Savoy, on the side of Italy, that he thinks it would be the advantage of that part of Europe, that the rest of the Milanese should be joined with that part whereof that prince is already possessed; he would even consent with pleasure to treat him then in quality- of king of Lombardy.

The king's sentiments on this occasion being intirely agreeable with those of the queen of Great Britain, there is no room to doubt, but that princess will also agree, that it is just that the duke of Savoy should be satisfied with the old barrier towards France, and that he restore the .places of Exilles and. Fenestrelles, botb

APPENDIX. — Report relating to the

cixt]

lying in Dauphine; his majesty confirming the promise he has made of restoring to him the duchy of Savoy, and the county of Nice; whereof the consideration is still above the importance of these two places for the frontier of the kingdom.

Besides these explanations, the king will give, with an intire confidence, the queen of Great Britain, all the explanations she will be pleased to ask him, fur the good of the peace; and since she desires to know, what are the king’s dispositions with respect to the elector of Brandenburgh, and the duke of Hanover; his majesty assures her, that he will make uo difficulty to acknowledge the first, as king of Prussia, and the second, as elector, when the peace is signed. The queen of Great Britain may even make use of this confidence, as she phail think roost fitting for advancing the peace, and be sure that the king will not disown her.

• In short, the desire which that princess expresses, to procure forthwith- the general tranquillity of Europe, seems - so sincere, that his jnajesty is further willing to communicate to her his intentions on the peace, to he made with . the empire: which are,

To acknowledge the archduke, as emperor.

: To restore to that prince, and to the empire, Fort Keile, in the same condition it is Stow in.

To cause the forts built in the Rhine, and depending on Strasburgh, to be demolished.

, To rase the fortifications built over against Hunninnen on the right, and in the Island of the Rhine.

In like manner, the fort built on the other fide of the Rhine, over against Fort Louis, as well as that part oflbe bridge leading from the Island to the right hand shore of the Rhine.

To demolish in .general, all the fortifications built, or raised on the other side of that river.

In short, to restore to the emperor the town of Brisac, - except nevertheless the fort called Mortier, lying on the left, and on this side of the Rhine.

Upon these conditions, which sufficiently fbew the king’s desire of leaving the empire in peace; his majesty desires only for himself the restitution of the town of Landau; and for the allies the re-establishment of the elector of Cologne, in his dominions, benefices, and dignities; referring himself, as to what relates to the elector of Bavaria, to what has already been mentioned, with respect to that jprince.

The king expects with impatience the happy affects of the application of the queen of Great ^Britain, in contributing to the re-establishment of the peace; and his majesty desires with no less earnestness a fitting time wherein-he may give public proofs of his sentiments for that princess.

St. Jameses 23, 1712. The Queen’s Instruction’s to my Lord Privy Seal, and the Lari of Strafford, her nipotentiariesfor a General Peace.

Upon your arrival at Utrecht, you are to begin by concerting with the ministers of our allies, in what manner it may be most proper to open the conferences, and what method to observe in the progress of the treaty. - You will upon this, and upon all other occasions, earnestly represent to these ministers, the great importance of appearing united; and . for that reason, recommend to them, that if any difference or dispute should arise, thesame should be accommodated amongst yourselves, that France may have no hold to break in upon you; but on the contrary, whenever you meet the enemies ministers in the congress, every opinion that is delivered, and every instance that is made, may be hacked by the concurrent force of the whole confederacy.

In order to bring this great work to a speedy issue, and to prevent, as much as possible, any advantage which the enemy might take, by a long negotiation, of divjdingjhe allies, or of slackening their preparations for another campaign, you are to propose, that a time be fixed for the conclusion, as was done for the commencement, of these conferences.

If it shall be thought proper to begin by the disposition of the Spanish monarchy, yon are to insist, that the security and reasonable satisfaction which the allies expect, and which his most Christian majesty has promised, cannot be obtained, if Spain and the West Indies bo allotted to any branch of the house of Bourbon V and in case the enemy should object, as the imperial ministers have done, That the second article of the seven, signed by the Sieur Mes-nager, implies, that the duke of Anjou shall continue on the throne of Spain, you are to-insist that those articles, as far as they extend, are , indeetl binding to France; but that they-lay neither us, nor our allies, under any pos-sitive obligation; that they were received only as inducements for opening of conferences; and that an agreement to take measures for preventing the crowns of France and Spain from being ever united upon one head, cannot be-constiued by any means to imply that the latter should remain to the present possession, since by the sixth article of the preliminaries-made in 1709, this very point was insisted upon, although in the same preliminaries it was agreed, That the duke of Anjou should abandon the throne of Spain. In treating therefore upon this bead, you are to fconsider, and settle. in conjunction with our allies, the most effectual measures for preventing the crowns of France and Spain from being ever united upon one head; and the conditions which shall be agreed as necessary to this effect, you are peremptorily to insist upon.

. Whether the great article of the Spanish

ccxriil APPENDIX. — .jR^ort relating to tht [cxxviir

monarchy shall be in the first place adjusted, or whether it shall be thought expedient to defer the consideration (hereof; you are, in* behalf of our allies, to demand of France the following terms, with such extensions and alterations, as the several parties concerned may he desirous of, and as shall appear just and reasonable. And for your better information and guidance, as well in respect to these articles, as to others, the several memorials and representations which we have received from divers princes and states, concerning their interests in the treaty of peace, are herewith delivered to you.

In the first place, with respect to the interests of our good brother the emperor, and of the empire, you erp to insist, that the town and citadel of Strasbourg be restored to them in the same condition they are at present, together with the fort of Kehl, and the dependencies thereof, situated on both sides of the Rhine, without the repayment of any demand of .charges under any pretext whatsoever, with one hundred pieces of brass cannon, of different sizes, and ammunition in proportion. That the said town of Strasbourg be likewise restored to the rank, prerogatives, and privileges^ of an imperial city; and do enjoy the same in such manner as they were enjoyed before it was brought under, the dominion of his most Christian majesty, both in ecclesiastical and civil rights; and you are to demand, that the said town and forts be effectually evacuated in such time and such manner, as shall be agreed upon by you in concert with our allies.

You are further, to insist, that the town of Brisac, with its territory, be restored to his imperial majesty, and the house of Austria, with all the cannon, artillery, and ammunition that are therein, to be held and enjoyed by his said imperial majesty, in such manner as Ire ought to have held and enjoyed the same, pursuant to the treaty of Ryswick.

. You are to endeavour to procure, that his most Christian majesty may hereafter have the possession of Alsatia, in such wise only as appears to be according to the literal sense of the treaty of Westphalia, ' and by virtue thereof, that he be contented with the right of prefecture over the ten imperial cites, lying in the said country of Alsatia, ' without extending the said right to the prejudice of the prerogatives, rights, and privileges, which belong to them, as to other free cities of the empire; but that his said most Christian majesty may enjoy the aforesaid right, together with the. prerogatives, revenues, and demains, in like manner as he ought to have enjoyed them at the rime of the conclusion of the treaty abovementioned.

You are to detaand, that the fortifications of the said ten towns be put in the same condition they were in at the time aforesaid, except the town of Landau; the possession and propriety whereof you are to procure to the emperor and the empire, with liberty to demolish the fortifications of that place, if they »h*U tbfokfit.

You are likewise to insist, that his most Christian majesty io pursuance of the said treaty of Westphalia, do, cause to be demolished, in such time as shall be agreed on, and at his own expence, the fortresses, which he has at present on the Rhine, from Basse td PhHipsburg, namely, Hunningen, New Brisac, and fort Louis, with the works belonging to the said fort, on both sides the Rhine, without ever rebuilding the same.

You are further to demand, that the town and fortress of Rhinfelt, with its dependencies, be put into the hands of our good cousin the landgrave of. Hesse Castle, until that matter be otherwise settled.

The clause inserted in the fobrth article of the treaty of Ryswick, relating to religion, being contrary to the honour of the treaty of Westphalia: you are accordingly to insist, that the same be revoked and annulled, and that the state of religion in Germany be re* stored to the tenour of the treaty of Westphalia aforesaid.

You are likewise to insist, that his most Christian majesty do acknowledge our good brother the king of Prussia in that quality:and that he do promise not to give to his said Prussian majesty, any disturbance in the possession of the principality of Neufchatel, and of the county of Valengin:and that be do restore the principality of Orange, to those to whom it shall appear by law to appertain, and such other estates as did belong to our late dear brother king William the Third, which are now in the hands of France.

Your are also to demand the -acknowledging of the electorate, which has been erected in favour of the duke of Hanover, now elector of Brunswick and Lunenburg.

And if any difficulty shall arise, concerning the time of acknowledging his Prussian majesty, and the elector of Hanover, the ministers of France insisting no*to do it until the peace bfe signed; and the ministers of these princes, insisting to be received as the ministers of a crowned head, and of an elector, at the first opening of the congress, you are in such case, to endeavour by some expedient to reconcile the dispute. You may in the first plaee propose, that the several ministers should confer, and treat together, without exchanging or producing their full powers, until they come to conclude and sign:you may in the next place offer, that the full powers of the Prussian, and Hanover ministers be accepted with a declaration, that this shall be of no consequence, unless the general peace ensue i thirdly, yoa may endeavour to terminate the difference, by pressing to have the foil powers of all the ministers put into the hands of such plenipotentiaries, as shall be agreed upon by the parties present.

As to our good brother the king of Portugal, you are to insist that he have and enjoy all the benefits and advantages granted to him by the treaties made between us, our allies, and his said majesty. ^

<£ntix} APPENDIX. — Negotiations for Peace: 1715. [cxJht

As to what relates to the particular interests' of our good friends and allies, the States General, yon are to insist that the most Christian king do yield, towards forming a sufficient banner to them, Fumes, Fort Knock, Menin, /Ipres, Lisle, Tournay, Conde, Valenciennes, and Maubeuge, as likewise Dotlay, Bethiine, Aire, St. Venants, and Bouchain, with their several dependencies, and the cannon, and artillery, and ammunition, now being in such of the aforesaid towns as are still ih the hands of the French, to be garisoned in such manner as is or shall be agreed on between us, and the skid States General, or others concerned. You ara farther to insist on that head, that his most Christian majesty do restore all the towns, forts, and places, belonging to Spain, which he at present possesses, or has been in possession of, daring the coarse of this war in the Spanish Low Countries, together with the cannon, artillery, and ammunition, now being and remaining therein, to the end, that such part of them that have been, or shall be- thought fit, may also be allotted for a barrier to the States General. •»

You are to use your utmost endeavours, that ’the tariff of 1664, be granted by France to the said States General, with the suppression of rflt other tariffs made since that time; revoking and annulling all edicts, declarations, itnd decrees, contrary thereunto; that the advantages of the treaty of Ryswick be likewise given to the States; and that the exemption of fifty pence per tun be allowed to all Dutch vessels, trading to the ports of France.

You are however to take especial care not to suffer these articles in favour of the States general to be concluded, until the treaty of succession and barrier be so explained, as to remote those apprehensions which we have as ter the consequence of it in some points, concerning which you are already instructed, and Shall hereafter be more fully informed of our pleasure.

As to our good brother the duke of Savoy, you are to demand that he be put again into possession of the Dutchy of Savoy, county of Nice, and all his hereditary countries and places yielded to him by the treaties made With the emperor and others of the allies; and that hiS most Christian majesty do likewise yield to the said dukie of Savoy, the towns ofExilles, Fenestfelles, and Chkumont, together with the valley of Pragelas, and all the tract of land lying between Piedmont and mount Gencvre, So that the said mountain may serve hereafter as a barrier between the kingdom of Frauce and the principality of Piedmont;

When the barrier of our good friends and allies the States General shall he under consi-rferationj or at any other time which in the course of this negotiation shall to you appear most proper, you are to press the explaining, Extending, and settling the' sixth article signed l»y the Sieur Mesrmger, which relates to the demolition of Dunkirk.

As to our own interests, you are to be parti-

... Vol.VII.

Cularly attentive to them in the whole bourse of this negotiation, to make use of every accident which may happen, and. of every, oc- 1 casion which the several allies may have of our assistance, in order to promote and secure the same with each of them.

Whereas J>y the treaty of barrier, the commerce of these our kingdoms to the Spanish Netherlands, and to such places as by virtue of the said treaty accrue to the States General, is exposed to be lost, or at least to become precarious: and whereat the Sieur Buys, their envoy extraordinary to us, has himself acknowleged the reasonableness of our apprehensions, and the justice there is that we should be secured against any prejudice, which we fiava reason to fear may arise to us from those great accessions which they have, at the expence of the blood and treasure of our subjects, acquired.

You kre therefore at the same time as you use your endeavours with the enemy, and such of the allies as may be concerned therein to procure to the states general tire effect of th» aforesaid treaty, to insist that Nieuport, Den-dermonde, the castle of* Ghent, and such other places as may rather appear to be a barrier against us, than against France, be either not put into the hands of the Dutch, or that such expedients be found for the doing thereof, a may secure the ingress and egress of our subjects in all the Low Countries, as fully and effectually as if the said barrier had not beett granted to the states general.

The seventh article of the barrier treaty giving a power to the states general, in case of an apparent attack, or of war, to put so many troops as they shall judge necessary into au the towns, places, and forts of the Low Countries, you are to endeavour to have this article so explained, as to be understood for the future only of an attack from, or of a war with' France, since nothing can be more unreasonable, than to leave it in the power of the states general to make use of the ten province^ against those to whom the sovereignty of thesd provinces may belong, or against the British nation.

It must be your further care, that a special provision be made that our subjects may not suffer in their commerce by any omission in the fifteenth article of thfe said barrier treaty, and . that it be expressly stipulated that the subjects of these our kingdoms shall trade as free* with the sarrie advantages and privileges, and under the same impositions and no other, as they used to do when those places were in the hands of France or Spain, or as the subjects of the states general themselves have done, o shall at any time hereafter do.

Pursuant to what is beforementioned, you are to make these instances, and’ such others as shall be hereafter directed upon these heads, wherein the interests of our kingdoms, and of the dominions of the States General may interfere, at such time and in such manner, that our satisfaction may go hand in hand with the settlement of theif barrier. *

No. 13.

A Specific Explanation of the Offers of France for a General Peace to the Satisfaction of all the Powers interested in the present war. Delivered February 11, 1712.

The king will acknowledge, at the signing the peace, the queen of Great Britain, in that quality, as well as the succession to that crown, according to the present establishment, and in the manner the most agreeable to her Britannic majesty.

His majesty will cause all the fortifications of Dunkirk to be demolished immediately after the peace, having an equivalent to his satisfaction. .

The Island of St. Christopher's, the bay and streights of Hudson, shall be yielded intirely to Great Britain, in likq manner Acadie, with its fort and fort royal, shall be intirely restored , to his majesty.

As to Newfoundland, the king offers to yield it again to Great Britain, reserving to himself only' the fort of Placentia, and the right of fishing and drying of cod-fish, as before the

war.

He will agree to make a treaty of commerce before or after the peace, at the choice of England, of which the conditions between the two nations shall be made as equal as possible.

The king 'will consent, at the signing the peace, that the Spanish Low Countries yielded to the elector of Bavaria by the king of Spain, aball serve as a barrier to the United Provinces; and to enlarge it, he will add thereto Fumes add its district, Knock, Ipres and its district, blenin and its district. In exchange his majesty demands for forming the barrier of France, Ai/e, St. Venant, Douay, Bouchain, and their dependencies.

If the States General will keep garrisons in the strong places of the barrier thus formed from the countries yielded to his electoral highness, and from what France shall add thereto, his majesty consents that they may put therein their troops in as great number sis they please: and further, that they be maintained at the charge of the country.

For this cession and consent, the king oq his part demands, for the equivalent of the demolition of Dunkirk, the cities and citadels of Lille aod Tournay, with their chastellenies and dependancies.

The barrier thus regulated between France and the States General, the king will agree to augment the commerce of their subjects, which is stipulated by the treaty of Ryswick and the advantageous tariff of 1664, excepting .only six sorts of merchandize, of which it shall be agreed, and which shall remain charged with the same duties as they now pay, together with the exemption of fifty sols per tun, upon the Dutch ships coming into France from the united provinces, and from foreign Countries.

As to the commerce of Spain and the Indies,

I

the king will promise, not only to the States General, .but also to Great Britain and to all the other powers, by virtue of an authority which he has for that purpose, that the commerce shall be made exactly and intirely after the same manner that it was. made under 'the reign, and, until the death, of Charles the second, and will promise, that the French shall be subject, as well as all other nations, to the ancient laws and rules made by the kings, predecessors of his catholic majesty, in relation to the commerce and navigation of the Spanish Indies.

His majesty further consents, that all the powers of Europe shall enter into a guaranty of this promise.

His majesty promises, that the king hie grandson shall renounce, for the good of the peace, ail his pretension to the kingdoms of Naples and Sardinia, 4s well as to the dutchy of Milan, which he will consent in the' same name, that the part yielded to the duke of Savoy do remain to his royal highness; provided that for this cesson the bouse of Austria shall likewise desist from all pretension uppn the other parts of the monarchy of Spain, from whence it shall draw its troops immediately after the peace.

The frontiers of both sides upon the Rhine, shall be put in the same state as they were before the present war.

For all these conditions above-mentioned the king demands, that the electors of Cologn and Bavaria be re-established in the full and intire possession of their estates, dignities, prerogatives, goods moveable and immoveable, which they enjoyed before the present war; and his majesty will reciprocally acknowledge in Germany and in Prussia, all the titles which to this time he has not acknowledged.

The king shall restore to the duke of Savoy what he hath taken from him during this w&r; in like manner his royal highness shall restore to him what he hath taken from France, so that the bounds on both sides shall be the same as they were before the declaration of war. '

All things in Portugal shall be re-established and remain upon the same foot in Europe as they were before the present war, as well in regard to Fiance as Spain:and as to the dominions which are in America, if there be any difference to regulate, endeavours will be used to agree it amicably.

Lords Plenipotentiaries to Mr. Secretary $t. John, March 6, 1712.

Extract.

The conference in order to communicate our several demands, was held yesterday ', and all produced theirs, except the imperial ministers, who having hut then received their courier from Vienna, desired time to prepare theirs. At this latter meeting count Zinzendorff insisted with great earnestness that each ally should in their several demands, make express mention of, and insist upon the restitution of the whole monarchy of Spain, that having been the great object of the war; the minister of Portugal joined in this requisition t- after a long silence count Zinzendorff pressed us and the Dutch to explain ourselves: We said, her majesty had thought it most proper each ally should make their own demands, and a general clause to support each other in obtaining a just and reasonable satisfaction was sufficient, especially since'the words, en conformity de ses alliances, ’ were in it: This we remained by.

The Dptcb, being again pressed in like manner, retired; pod after a long debate among themselves, being returned, spoke to the same purpose We had done; adding that Spain and the. Indies, ought to be demanded by those it immediately concerned; and Mr. Buys reasoned very much at large, that the method we had put things in, could not suffer it to be otherwise. Count Zinzendorff and his colleague parted with great discontent; the former s&ynig with much concern, This would be a fatal day for the grand alliance, &c. Here we thought this dispute had ended: but this morning the Dutch plenipotentiaries desired we would come to the town house a little before the time of meeting:those of France being come, they pressed us with the necessity of giving count Zinzendorff some content, and tit last declared they were resolved to do it: accordingly coming into the room where the allies ministers meet, they said, That since they perceived the argu-'meuts theyvused last night had not given content, they had now thought fit to go further, and accordingly declared the States General were resolved to make good all their treaties paade on.occasion of this war, as well those that related to Spain ami the Indies, as those made with Portugal, Prussia, Savoy, and others.

Upon this we immediately went to the conference yith the French, to deliver our several demands; while we were there, we considered the disadvantageous consequences of being the only ministers that did not make any mention at all of Spain and the todies, even a.t our conferences among ourselves, and thought it-might be proper to say something to taJ> off that odium; wherefore, being returned to the apartment of the allies, lord privy seal said, We are unwilling to speak more than we had done, till after we had given in our demands to France, because we could, not see lout the mentioning any one specially in our demands, would na-

turally have drawn on, the mention of more; but at present, to give the satisfaction so earnestly desired, we-owned, that -as her majesty insists for a just and reasonable satisfaction for all her allies in conformity to her alliances, those alliances that may concern Spain and the Indies, are understood thereby as others that concern the interests of the rest of the allies. We humbly hope what was said by lord privy seal on this occasion will noti>e found contrary to what has hitherto been declared; and that as it goes no further than tq just and reasonable, it does not import any new obligation.

The Answer to the Memorial brought by M. Gaultier, March23, 1712. March 28, 1712,

Extract.

The last article of the memorial certainly requires muck discussion, and to be maturely examined: the matter is so important that one ought to depend upon the first views and conceptions of it^ the more specious they are, the more dangerous it is to be misled by a persuasion of their being easily executed. '

France can never consent to become a province of Spain, and Spain will likewise think the same in respect to France; it is therefore our. business to- take solid measures to hinder the uniop, of the two monarchies; but we should absolutely depart from the end proposed, and should fall into ibftnite misfortunes, worse, if It be possible, than what we would unanimously avoid, if we act contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom.

According to these laws the most near prince to the crown is of necessity the heir thereto; ’ti* an inheritance that he receives neither froiti the king his predecessor, nor from the people, but from the benefit of the law: so that whet* one king die9, the other succeeds him forthwith, without asking the consent of any person whatsoever. He succeeds not as heir, but as the master of the kingdom, the seignory whereof belongs unto him, not by choice, but by right of birth only.

He is not beholden for his crown, either to the will of his predecessor, or to any edict, not to any decree, nor to the liberality of any person, but to the law. This law is looked upon as the work of him who hath established all monarchies, and we are persuaded in France, that God only can abolish it. ' - *

Whitehall, March 23, 1711. V. S.

Mr. Secretary St.John to M- de Torcy.

Sir; I was answering yourletter, of the 20th of this month, N. S. the day before yesterday, when a courier brought me that of the 28th? with a memorial of the same date.

The queen believes Mr. Gaultier will have given you satisfaction upon the points contain-

fXpcvii]

«d in the fir*t, and her majesty has commanded

me, without loss of time, to communicate'to you ber Sentiments, in regard to the article of the union of the two monarchies, upon which your last dispatch generally run.

The facilities which have been received from hence, for the conclusion of a general peace, have beeu expected from the queen, nr than any other power could have contributed. The first motive that her majesty had to make all these steps, has been a firm trust, founded upon the so often repeated assurances, on the part of his most Christian majesty, that he would, consent to take all the measures necessary to hinder for ever, that union of so ill consequence to all Europe.

The expedient 'that Mr. Gaultier has been instructed to propose, is the only one which seems to the queen capable of giving the least hope of preventing this inconveniency; and her majesty observes, that the proposition contained in your memorial, does but confirm and make the queen and her allies parties to a plan which has been, and which is now more than ever, the object of their fears.

It is not necessary that I should enter into the particulars of the objections upon which we might insist. You are, sir, of too dear a genius ndt to see them in their whole extent and force. The queen relies too much upon the equity of the king your master, and the sincere desire he has always shewn for a general peace, to he capable of imagining, that he will require her'to content herself with a surety of so little solidity as that proposed in the memorial; or that she should suffer that the case might happen, that he that shall be in possession of the crown of Spain, should have-the right to succeed to the crown of France: Who would then assure ns that this prince would not make use of his power to keep the one, and to acquire the other, rather than shew a moderation without example?

We are ready to believe that you are persuaded in France, that God alone can abolish that lew upon which your nght of succession is founded; bnt you will give us leave to be persuaded in Great Britain, that a prince may depart from his right by a voluntary cession, and that he, in favour of whom that renunciation is made, may be justly supported in his pretensions, by the powers which become guaranties' of the treaty.

In short, sir, the queen commands me to tell you, that this article is of so great consequence, as well for herself as for the rest of Europe, for this present age, as for posterity, that she will never agree to continue the negotiations of

Kace, unless the expedient she has proposed accepted, or some other equally solid.

I dispatch, however, a courier to the lords plenipotentiaries, to communicate to them the queen's orders1 upon this subject; and I must tell yeu they cannot accept of any plan for a general peace, as reasonable as it may be in other respects, if they do not receive satisfaction upon the means to binder this union.

([cxxxriit

It would bo in effect, building upon the sand, taking unnecessarily many precautions to make a peaces and not have prevented a danger se great and so probable as this. »

We see with a great deal of satisfaction, that you wish this new proposition should he looked on only as a first thought: let us do what we can on each side, that our seco.id thoughts may nearer meet; and let us not leave impel'-feet a work which hath been so advanced, spight of that vigorous and general opposition.

1 am rejoiced that the king has been pleased to recompence the services of M. Gaultier, by giving him an ubbey. He will not fail to be useful at Utreclit, and what is certain, he wilt find the queen's ministers in the disposition to shorten the negociation. I beg you would be persuaded that I am, &c.

No, IT.

M- Torcy tQ Mr. St., April 8, 17 If.

I received by the courier, returned from London, the letters you honoured me wjtlt of the 23rd, and 24th March O. S. and observed, with a great deal of pleasure, in the last, that you thought the conditions of the* treaty of peace would be soon adjusted to common satisfaction, if the means of preventing the reunion of the monarchies of France and Spain could Ke settled and agreed on.

I believe, sir, (hat it oanaot be impossible to find out an expedient which all Europe is equally concerned to settle; and since you do not altogether stick at that which Mr. Gaultier proposed to me on your part, I hope second thoughts upon this matter may prove more successful than the first. If it is not yet intirely ta your satisfaction, be pleased to communicate. to me what may be added to it, or Father taken from it. In short, let us labour earnestly, and without prevention, for the conclusion of a work of so great importance as that of the peace.

As the principal difficulty which still opposes the conclusion of it, is the trouble to find suP fieient security to prevent the dangerous res union of the monarchies of France and Spaing the king proposes to consent by the treaty of peace, of which all the powers of Europe shall be guarantees, that if ever the king of Spain, Philip V. or the prince his son, or any of their children, who shall succeed them to the kingdom of Spain, becomes either the next and presumptive heir, or the successor of the crown of France, and prefers it to the crown of Spain, that of Spain shall belong of full right to the prince whom they shall fix- upon by the same treaty to possess it; that not only king Philip shall sign and ratify this condition of the treaty, but moreover, that all the powers of Europe shall enter into an engagement with France, to maintain this article; so that if the prince of the House of France, that shall reign in Spain, has a Inind to assert his right to the crown of

Ptace: 1715.

cxxxix] APPENMX.-rJIqpoH relating to the fexl

France in the manner I just now observed, he shall be obliged to renounce his own right, and that of his descendants, to the crown of Spain, to depart from thence and to go to France with all his children, princes, and princesses.

That if he prefers the crown of Spain to that of France, or the quality of heir and immediate successor to the crown of France, he shall be obliged to renounce, in favour of the line which shall follow nearest his own, and which shall remain in France, his own right, and that of his ohildren, to the said crown of France: So that, in this case, the catholic king, or he that should rejgo in his stead, should have the choice as being eldest; but he cannot possess the two monarchies together, or inherit that of France, and leave Spain to one of his children.

If you. should ask, sir, what precaution must be taken to settle such a renunciation as J have laid before you, as being contrary to the order established in France for the succession to the crown, I answer, first, That there is no room to suppose that the king of Spain would prefer the crown of Spain to that of his forefathers, for a thousand reasons easy to comprehend, and too tedious to lay down.

Secondly, That if he was so ill advised to make $uch a choice, the securest precaution would be what you insinuate in one of the letters you honoured me with, viz. a solemn engagement which all the powers of Europe should enter into by the treaty of peace, to maintain a disposition made with a view of preserving the general liberty and repose of Europe.

Since the clause of the will of the late king of Spain, Charles II. which appoints the duke of Berry, appears rather a new obstacle to the peace, than an expedient capable of preventing the union of the two monarchies, it seems necessary to consent that the king of Portugal possess himself of the crown of Spain, as soon as the king of Spain should be called to the succession of France, and should prefer it to the crown of Spain.

The marriage of the king of Portugal with a princess of the House of Austria, would countenance the disposition to be made in favour of this prince; but if it be not convenient to think of him to be king of Spain, they may, 4>n the same foundation, choose that Prince who would marry one of the archdutchesses daughters of the emperor Joseph.

. In short, the duke of Savoy, being nominated by the wills of the late kings of Spain, in default of the house of Austria, he may likewise be choseu:but as a king of Spain, master both of Piedmont and Savoy, would be a dangerous neighbour to France; the king would find himself obliged^ to demand for a barrier, not only the rest|tution of Exillea and Fenestrelles, but even the cession of Savoy and the county of Nice.

To settle more firmly the tranquillity of Europe, it may be agreed upon by the treaty of peace, that the measures taken to prevent the union of the two monarchies be received and

confirmed by the Cortes, or States, of the kingdoms of Spain.

I wish, Sir, this plan may be agreeable to the intentions and sentiments of thequeen of Great Britain; and I cannot but hope so, since it is vour own thought to guaranty the renunciations by the powers who shall sign the treaty of peace; and no better care can certainly be taken to confirm the validity of these acts, than stipulate them by a solemn treaty, of which all Europe is concerned to back the execution.

The king orders me to acquaint his plenipotentiaries of what I have the honour to write to you ', and I hope, Sir, that the good under* standing and correspondence between his majesty and the queen of Great Britain; will daily encrease in Such a. manner, that the enemies to the peace shall have no room to triumph. You will have the pleasure to silence such as are so; and I desire no less the satisfaction of findingopportunities to assure you how truly I am, &c., DeTobct.

No. 18.

Mr. St. John to M, de April 6, 1712.

I answer now the letter which you did me the honour to write to me the 8th instant, N. S. and which I received by. the- same messenger who brought me your former.

Be assured, Sir, that we will go on vigorously and without prevention, in accomplishing the great work of the peace; the conditions whereof will soon be settled to the common satisfaction, provided we agree .oil the means to prevent the union of the two monarchies of France and Spain. You see, Sir, I am still of the same opinion.

Each of our allies has his own private ends; they are not at all perhaps limited within the bounds of reason; there are several, besides inconsistent one with another. ‘It is not ner ’cessary these points should be so Strictly taken notice of; ana reciprocal condescensions will not fail reducing all these differences to a just and reasonable medium. But the article concerning the union of the two monarchies, it of that nature and importance, that the least false step in it cannot but prove fatal; lind all the advantages that could possibly be stipulated would be paid for too dearly, in accepting of an expedient too weak to obviate so real a danger.

I must confess, Sir, that second notions prove better than the first; and .that they clear up many difficulties, at the same time that they dissipate most of our apprehensions. To avoid all equivocation, and to prevent the least mis- Understanding on so nice a subject, you will give me leave to explain in what sense her majesty takes the words you make use of, and the scheme you offer by the king’s order. You propose then, that the prince, who at present reigns in Spain, shall not wait according to your former plan, that the crown of France falls to him, for to, choose which of the two he likes

exli] APPENDIX. — Negotiations for Peace: 11 15. [cilri

best; but that as soon as he becomes either immediate successor of the crown of France or presumptive heir, he will be obliged to declare his choice; and you settle the same rule for his issue.

Now, Sir, the queen thinks the objection which has been made to your former proposition may, in some measure, take place as concerning this: for in either of the two cases you lay down, how will Europe be certain that such a choice will be made? All the powers, you say, will be guarantees of that convention; such a guaranty, indeed may form a grand alliance, to wage war against the prince who will offer to break the conditions of the treaty: but we seek the means rather to prevent than support new wars.

. Finally, Sir, must not one confess that there appears no expedient effectully able to secure Europe from the dangers wherewith it is threatened, by the union of the two monarchies, unless the prince, who at present is in possession of Spain, makes his choice at this very instant; and unless, according to that choice, the order of the two successions be settled in the general treaty of peace ?

Her majesty remarks with very great pleasure, that this plan does not much differ from that which his most Christian majesty has caused to be communicated to her. Let us, in the first place, argue, if you please, on the supposition, that the above mentioned prince will chuse the crown of his ancestors preferably to that of Spain,

There is in nature but one case alone, that may happen to render our proposal less advantageous to him than yours.

Pardon me, Sir, ' if I make two suppositions very disagreeable, but necessary for the better understanding the question:we are examining if the young dauphin should chance to die, the prince we are talking of would be immediate successor of the crown of France; in this case then he can lose nothing in choosing the crown of France now aforehand.

His most Christian majesty (whom God preserve for many years) happening to die, the same prince would be presumptive heir of the crown of France. In this case, how should he be a loser, in making his choice as the queen desires ? Can it be said he runs the hazard to quit Spain, without gaining France ? Yon see, Sir, he would be exposed to the same inconveqiency by your own scheme. From all that I have said, the queen's opinion is, Sir, that it follows, it will equally be advantageous to the prince now in question, to chuse the crown of France at present, or to do it in any of the two circumstances set down in your letter: and you will be doubtless convinced, that the security of Europe will be established infinitely better one way than the other.

If we argue on the supposition that this prince will chuse the crown of Spain, it is beyond dispute, in the first place, that it is much better for him and for us, that this declaration should be made touring the congress at Utrecht; than

at any other time. Secondly, that the guarantee of the powers' of Europe will be much abler to prevent his return to France, contrary to the formal renunciation that he shall have made of this right, than to force him to quit a crown, whereof he will be in possession, and to depart from a pretension which he has not renounced.

I have as clearly as possible, laid before your eyes, Sir, the queen's thoughts on the contents of your last letter: her majesty sedks but' the common safety; the most Christian king, has the same views. In God's name, to be over-nice in the negotiation, let us not lose those benefits which we are ready to reap.

Let the king your master, and the queen my mistress, share in the glory of giving peace to Europe; and let those, who are desirous to break the conferences by the events of the campaign, find their projects overturned, by the speedy conclusion of the treaty.

On one hand, his most Christian majesty may secure; the peaceable possession of the crown of Spain to his grandson ; on the other hand, he may strengthen the succession olf the crown of France, for ever prevent the union ’. of the empire with Spain, and procure to his kingdom very considerable advantages: on both sides he may set Europe free from apprehensions and fears, and perfect a work ds glorious as that of a definitive, secure and lasting peace.

By the letters of Messieurs the plenipotentiaries, dated the 12th instant, N. S. I understand we are to expect, within a few days, the arrival of M. Gaultier; and that he is to bring with him a plan of the general peace which was formed at Utrecht. We hope his most Christian majesty will explain himself on that subject, after such a manner, as the queen may make the necessary declarations to secure the success’ of our negotiations. I will tell you, as a man > who most sincerely wishes for peace, that the condescensions that may be accepted from the ' queen, depend on the resolution which will be taken concerning the grand article of the union of the two monarchies. I am, &c.

Henry St. John.

No. 19.

M. Torey to Mr. St. John. April 26, 1712.

They easily agree, Sir, where intentions are sincere, and desires equal on both sides to arrive to the same end. I observed with a great deal of satisfaction, by the letter you honoured’me with of the 6th instant, O. S. that the plan I proposed to you, has cleared several difficulties, and dissipated many' occasions. I hope likewise, that the answer you returned in it, will perfect the work beguR.

According, Sir, to what you writ me, the only difference there is between the proposition I made to you by the king’s command, and the project of the queen, depends entirely on the time when the king of Spain shall declare the

cxliin APPENBEJC. — Reporetowg totht' [ctlir

choice he intends to make, either to maintain his right to the crown of France, or keep that of Spain. ... t .

In my proposition, the making his choice was referred to the time, when this prince should become* either immediate successor, or presumptive heir, of the crown of France: and the same condition was observed in respect of his progeny.

You observe, Sir, that in deferring till then S choice so essential to the tranquillity of Europe, ' it cannot be certain that there will be one made, if ever such an unhappy occasion should happen, that the guaranty of all the powers, who shall be concerned in the treaty, sha$ form a sufficient alliance to declare war to the prince, who should violate the conditions of the peace:but the end that ought at present to he proposed, is, to binder the renewing of the war, and not to seek means to support thqse which should arise upon this occasion.

You jthen conclude, that to prevent the reunion of the monarchies of France and Spain it is necessary that the catholic kingshould now declare his choice, without waiting the unhappy event, which we hope will never happen; but that it must, in the mean time, be supposed, end care taken, that this choice may establish the order of the succession, by the treaty, of the general peace. '

Your observations, Sir, and the consequences which may be drawn from them, are equally just; the catholic king must (felm the uneasiness of .Europe, in declaring at present what part he will take, if ever the succession of France is open in his' favour. Indeed it will be perhaps some uneasiness to him, to declare at present to the Spaniards, that he would abandon them, and go to France, if one of the two cases, which you suppose, should happen. A nation, uncertain, of the master she shall "have, may prove less faithful to him that actually reigns; but this inconveniency ought, to submit to the general goad, . Thus, sir, the king, approving your proposition, dispatches a Courier to Spain, an.d writes to the king his grandson, to let him know the necessity of resolving on the choice he will make, and declare it; to the end it may be inserted in the treaty of the general peace, and that it be made a condition of it whereof all Europe shall be guarantee. .

I hope. Sir, the king -of Spain will conform himself to the counsel of the king; but if it should happen, what I cannot believe, that he will not submit to it, his majesty will take all the measures the queen of Great Britain slrall judge proper, to determine of necessity, and even by force, the choice of the king of Spain, and to secure to Europe the peace, which at present appears so advanced.

I am confident there .will no occasion be given of coming to such an extremity; but the king is willing I should inform, you ojf his resolution in tbi$ matter, as being a new mark of the sincere and true desire ot his majesty, for Ike ready conclusion of a safe and solid peace.

I.look upon it at present very much advanced, and that the principal difficulty, which might still render it more acceptable, seems removed, but in the mean time, we must expect new difficulties from those who would willingly break the conferences. I believe the ' best way to subvert their designs would tie for the queen of Great Britain to propose Immediately a suspension of arms; for they ground their hopes oiKtbe event of the campaign. And as I find, by your letter that her Britannic majesty is disposed tO make the necessary declarations for establishing the success of the negotiations, jt is my opinion that the proposition of a suspension might make part of those declarations.

: I have, detained Mr. Gaultier here some days longer than he ought to have staid in expects* tion of your answers* thinking it necessary he should be informed of your sentiments before he sets out tor England; he will inform you. Sir, of the king's intentions on the demands of your allies. I hope, that as the most difficult point is now regulated, you will have respect only to the. justice and solidity of the peace; and that the queen of Great Britain* acting by these great motives, will give the last marks of the desire she has to establish with the king a perfect good correspondence.

I received, Sir, by the same courier* the letter you honoured me with of the 11th instant

O. S. I am very sorry for the indisposition of my lord treasurer, . and earnestly wish his immediate recovery. It is very reasonable that those who have Jiad, like you. and him* the principal part in the management of the peace, should have the honour to bring it to perfection. I hope we shall soon see the success of it, * and desire you will believe that, at all times whatsoever, no one shall be with greater truth than I am, Sir, &c* Dx Toxct.

No. 20 *

Mr. St. Jbhh to M. de Torcy. April 29,

Sir; The plan you proposed, in your letter of the 8th of April, appeared to us to remove many difficulties, and dissipate divers cause* of fears; but by reason ofhavhig misunder-- stood the intentions of the king, and ill explained those of the queen, we now find ourselves farther, than we had hoped, from agreeing upon the grand articles of the peace.

It is very true, that the only difference there is between the proposition you made ine by the king's order, in the sense we comprehended it, apd that which I sent you by order of the queen, relates only to the time when the prince in question shall make his choice, either to preserve his right' to the crown of France, by re--notincing that of Spain, or to keep that Spain, by renouncing that of France. But yea do not propose- therein. Sir, that /the execution shall accompany the choice, which* is absolutely* necessary to render this peace definitive.

The abbot Gaultier explains quite otherwise the king's intentions; and I observe tbatyot *

' APPENBDC^go^iowybr Peace :‘l 715. {cxlv$

say the prince, who reigns in Spain, most calm the inquietude of Europe by declaring now the part he will take, if the succession of France is ever opened in his favour. After this manner oyr great work will not be much ad* vahced by the last proposition.

If we had understood according to the explication that you now give it, you see, sir, that we should have fallen into a very great absurdity; since in rejecting your project, we should have drawn up another, against which all the objections we made, and which were found even in France just and well founded, would have equally taken plade. For though the prince, who reigns in Spain, makes his choice from this time, what greater security shall Europe have, if the execution of this choice is referred to another time ? In offering that he shall be obliged to declare his choice vfrom this time, you arc already agreed that neither, the stipulations of a treaty, nor the guarantee of the powers engaged in this War, can be capable to secure that the choice shall be made; how then can we conclude that they can be capable to secure that, when either of the cases shall happen that we are with regret obliged to foresee, and to suppose, he will quit one crown to hold - another, according to the choice that he shall have made, and which shall have been inserted in the treaty of the general peace?

The queen baS often declared that it would be impossible for her to be contented with any expedient, which was not very solid, touching an. article of so great importance as that' of the xe-union of the two monarchies. To do otherwise, would be to lose the fruits of all the blood the allies have spilt in the course of this war; it would be at last to betray the common cause of Europe, and to expose the present age, as well as those which are to coipe, to one of she greatest dangers that the imagination can form.

Her Majesty sincerely desires the peace, she desires it reasonable for France; but to come to this issue, the interest of France must not be rendered inconsistent with the general security.

It must be done so as the time can never happen, in which the same prince shall have both th£ crown of Spain upon his head, and his succession open to that of France.

If this prince of whom we speak is net contented with Spain; or if France will not, in passing him by, too much weaken their succession; must we for this reason, the peace being made, take up arms, and be in a continual apprebensionof seeing the war renewed ? The queen can never consent thereto, and her majesty thinks there is not one of the allies who will submit to so Hard a condition.

To shew nevertheless that she is ready to contribute all in ber power to satisfy his most Christian majesty, without wounding her honour, and without sacrificing her interests and those of her confederates, the queen orders me

Vol. VII.

sir, to propose to you an expedient, by which king Philip may preserve his right to the erbwn of his ancestors, and find a recompence for Spain, which in this case be shall be obliged to abandon. *

Her Majesty therefore proposes, that this prince does immediately retire with his family out of Spain; that the d uke of Savoy do transport himself thither at the same time with his, and take possession of that monarchy and tbq Indies: that king Philip may enjoy the kingdom of Sicily, the hereditary countries of his royal highness, with the Montserrat, Mantuan ; *and iq case he succeeds to the crown of France, that Sicily returns under the obedience of the house of Austria, but that the other countries may remain to him, and be hereafter looked upon as provinces of France. The queen would1 desire that this proposition might appear to come from his most Christian majesty, to be an effect of his moderation, and a sacrifice that he is willing to make, te draw Europe out of the disorder it is now in, ' and to re-establish the general* tranquillity.

Her majesty thinks she has now given all the facilities in her power to conclude the peace, and hath asked nothing but what is necessary for accomplishing that promise which the most Christian king made, when he declared himself ready to take all just and reasonable measures to hinder the crowns of France and Spain frpm being ever re-united, upon the head of one and the’same person.

The queen commands me to add, that sh* hopes the propositions I have made by her order, will be accepted; but however she insists that the answer you send me be categorical and final.

The circumstances we now find ourselves in, as well as the season of the year, do not admit that we remain in any longer uncertainty, whether we shall have war or peace.

The parliament, to whom her majesty hath promised the communication of what she should treat oii the subject of peace, will become impatient: and the queen cannot excuse herself from communicating to them the answer she shall receive to this letter. The armies are in the field, and the events of ome day's' time may intirely change the face of affairs t how much soever disposed the queen is to facilitate the negociation of the peace, and to save the effusion of blood, she cannot how-, ever declare for a - suspension of arim, before; she knows the resolution of the most Christian; king, upon the expedient proposed to prevent the re-union of the two monarchies.

If I tell you nothing, sir, touching the plan of the general peace, - which the abbot Gaultier also brought us, it is because the queen doet not look upon the differences which it contains as too difficult to be adjusted, provided the article of the re-union be once passed; and because if we are not happy CDOugn to succeed in treating of this expedient, it would be but % needless trouble to negociate upon other points.

I am, &c. H. St. Jobh.

Sir; I have received the letteryou did me the favour to write to me of the 10th instant, and atn very sorry to see there'was so great difference, as you tell me, between the proposition you made me by order of the queen, and the answer the king commanded me to make to you: for want of understanding one another, we have unhappily lost a time, of which every mqment is precious: and now we must have a new decision from theking of Spain, upon a plan which had been proposed to him in a different sense to what, you understood it.

* I confess, sir, I should fear that this explication would produce new difficulties at the court of Madrid, if the king had ndt resolved to •tfrmount all the objections her majesty can make upon an article Vhich is to be the basis of. the peace, and likewise to sacrifice the interests of his house for the re-establishment of the public tranquillity.

, It is therefore to remove these difficulties, that the king now makes two propositions to the king his giabdson:First to renounce by the treaty of peace, for himself and his descendants, all his right to the crown of France, and content himself with Spain and the Indies.

. The second, to preserve his right to the crown of France, but at the same time to ield Spain and the Indies to the duke of avoy, and content himself, in exchange, with the countries the duke of Savoy, now possesses; lhat is to say, with the principality of Piedmont, the dotchies of Savoy and Montserrat, and county of Nice.. Lastly, to keep the kingdom of Sicily, whereof the catholic king is now master. Provided always that if he should Coe day come to the crown of France, he should keep only the countries now belonging to thednke of Savoy, and that in this case the kingdom of Sicily shall belong to the house of Austria.

It were to be wished that the king could at present know the intentions of the king his grandson, upon one or the other of these two alternatives; but we must unavoidably wait for the return of the courier that his majesty dispatches to Madrid.

He has commanded me nevertheless to assure you, that' the freaty of peace shall be made upon the basis of the ope or the other of these two propositions; viz. Either the king of Spain sbqjl renounce his right to the crown of France, to keep only Spain and the Indies; or that he shall consent to the exchange of Spain and the Indies with the estates of the duke of Savoy, on the conditions I have now acquainted yon with. You are therefore, sir, to look upon what I write to you by the king’s order, as the final answer that you desire, and which ought to remove all uncertainty upon the peace, or upon the continuation of the war.

It is probable, sir, that the peace would still be more certain, if a suspension of arms could

be agreeff upon on b4th sides, and might, since at present each side, may well expect an happy conclusion:but it must be left to the prudence of the queen to examine what she shall think most agreeable to the general good, which she desires a? much as any person.

It would be very sad, if any. event should happen during the campaign to disturb the good dispositions which are now apparent for estab-isHing the public tranquillity. I hope, sir, you will very soon give the last band thereto; and I pray you to believe, that no one can honour you more perfectly, nor be more truly than I am, sir, &c. DeTokct.

Memorial Mr. St. John to M. de Torcy, relating to North Am, and

the Suspension of Arms, May 24, 1712.

To end all disputes arisen about North America, the queen proposes:

1. That his most Christian majesty should yield to her the island of Newfoundland, with Placentia, and all the fortifications, artillery and ammunitions thereto. belonging, the little adjacent islands, and the nearest the island of Newfoundland; as also Nova Scotia, or Acadie, according to its ancient limits.

2. That the subjects of his most christier) majesty may continue to fish, and dry their fish, upon that part of Newfoundland which is called the Petit Nord, but on no other part of the said island.

3. That his majesty’s subjects may enjoy in common with the queen’s, the island of Cape Breton.

4. That the islands in the Gulph of St. Laurence, and in the mouth of the river of thqt name, which are at present possessed by the French, may remain to his most Christian majesty; bat expressly upon condition that his said majesty shall engage himself not to raise, or suffer to be raised, any fortifications in thesb islands, or in that of Cape Breton. The queen engages herself likewise not to fortify, or suffer any fortifications to be raised in the adjacent islands, and those next Newfoundland, nor iit-that of Cape Breton.

5. The queen Insists to have the cannon and ammunitions of war, in all the forts and placet of the bay and streights of Hudson.

Relating to .

As some difficulties are arisen, which hinder our giving the finishing stroke to the treaty of commence between the two nations of Great Britain and France, so sgon as could have been wished, by reason of many prohibitions made, and many excessive duties established, in the said kingdoms, ; And as it is necessary for the subjects of both sides, that the commerce between the two nations be opened, and have jte effect as soon as possible; the queen would have many propositions to make his most chris-

extis] APPENDIX.-~Nc£oriari<m/or Peace: 1715. £cl

tian majesty thereupon; But as these points would require a longer time to be discussed than the present crisis does permit/ the queen being more inclined to confirm the general tranquillity, than private advantages, contents herself with making two demands, Which she believes can meet with no difficulty.

1. That in case we do not agree upon the points in dispute, relating to commerce, commissaries be named on each side, who shall mefet at London to examine and regulate the duties and impositions that shall be paid in Cach kingdom:and that they be adjusted in such a manner, that by it the commerce between the two nations be encouraged and enlarged.

3. That no privilege or advantage in regard to the French trade, shall be granted to aBy foreign nation, which shall not be granted at the same time to the queen of Great Britain’s iubjects. In like manner, no privilege or advantage relating to the trade of Great Britain, shall be granted any foreign nation, that shall not at the same time be granted to the subjects of his most Christian majesty.

• Relating to the Suspension of Arms.

I

The Queen will consent to a suspension of arms for the term of two months, upon condition,

1. That in the said term, the article which relates to the re-union of the two monarchies shall he punctually and intirely executed. That is to say, either that king Philip shall renounce in that term, for himself and his descendants, his rights to the crown of France; and shall consent that his renunciation be inserted in the treaty for a future peace; or that in this term he snail leave. Spain with his family, yielding up that kingdom and the Indies to the duke of Savoy, on the conditions mentioned in roy letter of the 39th April, O. S. and accepted by that from M. de Torcy, of the 18th of this month, N. S.

3. That the French garrison shall go out of the town, citadel, and forts of Dunkirk: and that the queen’s troops shall enter % it the day the suspension of arms shall begin; and that that place shall remain in the queen’s hands till the States General shall have consented to give his most Christian majesty an equivalent for the demolishing of it, with which he shall be contented. It being understood^shat in this case his most Christian majesty shall be obliged to demolish all the fortifications of that place, to fill up the harbour, and destroy the .sluices, in the manner the queen’s plenipotentiaries have required.

3. Incase the States General do consent to a suspension of arms at the same time with the queen, it seems reasonable to grant them the liberty of putting a garrison in Cambray, on the day the said suspension shall have its effect. H.St. Jour.

The Answers of the King to the Memorial sent from London, June 5, 1713. N. S.

i Mar ley, June 10, 1718.

Art. 1. His majesty consents to yield to the queen of Great Britain the Isle of Newfoundland, with the city of Placentia, as now fortified; but the artillery and ammunition with which that place is provided, shall be taken from thence, and shall not be comprehended in the cession which shall be made of that place, and of the Island; for they are not . to be esteemed as belonging either to the one or the other; and to use a common comparison, one may look upon the artillery and arnmnni- . tion of a place as moveables of an house, that a private man carries away with him when he yields that same house by a voluntary contract.

The Isles adjacent to that of Newfoundland were neither demanded nor promised by the articles signed at London in the month of October last: As these articles have served as a rule in the beginning and in the progress of the present negoci&tion, the king’s intention ia td follow exactly the same rule, as the most sure one to come to the (Conclusion of tha treaty; and his majesty is persuaded that the qtfeen of Great Britain, faithful to her word, will not insist upon a new demand, and which does not appear in the convention signed in the name of that princess.

The king is willing to add to that convention the cession of Acatlie according to its ancient limits, as it is demanded by the queen of Great Britain.

3. The articles signed at London reserve to the subjects of the king the power of fishing and drying of cod-fish upon the isle of Newfound* land. A disposition, made and Agreed to, can neither be restrained, nor receive any alterations but those which are reciprocally judged to be conformable to the Common advantage. *

Upon this foundation the king offers to leave to England the artillery and ammunition of Placentia, the isles adjacent to that of Newfoundland:to forbid the French the liberty of fishing and dryine of cod-fish upon the coast of that isle, likewise upon that part called the Petit Nord; to add to these conditions the cession of the isles of St. Martin and St. Bartholomew, adjoining to that of St. Christopher, if for this new offer ithe queen of Great Britain consents to restore Acadie, of which the river of Sr. George shall hereafter make the boundaries, as the English heretofore pretended to it.

It is therefore at the choice of the queen of Great Britain, either to keep to the articles signed at London, or to accept the exchange that his majesty proposes. In this last case his majesty will endeavour to facilitate all that shall depend on him, to conclude the affair of the ransom of the island of Nevis to the satisfaction Of England,

efi) AVVmmX.--Repi>rt relating to fell!

8. As the perfect good understanding that the king proposesto establish between his'sob* jeccs and those of the queen of Great Britain, will, if it please God, be one of the principal advantages of the peace, we must remove all propositions capable* of disturbing this happy union; experience has riiade it too visible, that it was impossible to preserve it in the places possessed in common by the French and English nations; so tins reason alone will suffice to hinder his majesty from consenting to the proposition of leaving the English to possess the isle of Cape Breton in common with the French* But there is still a stronger reason against this proposition; as jt is but too often seen that the most athicable nations many times become enemies, it is prudent in the kmg to reserve to himself the possession of the only isle which will hereafter open an eu*ranee into the river of St. Lawrence; it would be absolutely shut to the ships of his majesty, if the English masters of Acadie and Newfoundland, still possessed the isle of Cape Breton in common with the French; and Canady would be lost to France as soon as the war should be' reitewed between the two nations, which God .forbid; but the most secure means to prevent it, is often to think that it may come to pass.

4i It will not be dissembled, but it is for the same reason that the king is willing to reserve to himself the natural and common liberty as aU sovereigns have, .to erect in the isles of the gulph and in the mouth of the river of St. Lawrence, as well as in the isle of cape Breton, such fortifications as his majesty shall judge necessary; these works, made only for. the security of the country, caH never be of any detriment to the neighbouring isles and provinces.

It is just that the queen of Great Britain should have the same liberty to erect what fortifications she shall think necessary, whether in Acadie or in the isle of Newfoundland:and upon this article the king does not pretend to exact any thing contrary to the rights which the propriety and possession naturally give to th^t princess.

5. The king is willing, through a particular consideration of the queen of Great Britain, to leave to her the cannon and ammunition which shall be found in the forts and places of the bay and streights of Hudson, notwithstanding the strong reasons that his majesty may have to take them from thence, and transport them elsewere.

Article of Commerce.

As the king sincerely desires that all cause of division between his majesty and the queen of Great Britain should cease as soon as may be, it would be very agreeable to him to see all disputes relating to commerce settled at Utrecht between his plenipotentiaries and those of England; But if it is impossible to remove the difficulties about this matter before the conclusion of the peace, rather than to delay it, his majesty consents to the two demands made in the name of that princess. '

1. To name commissaries, who shall meet at London to examine and regulate the duties and impositions to be paid In each kingdom.

2. That France and England do reciprocally engage to give to the subjects of both crowns the same privileges and advantages, with which, any nation whatsoever shall be favoured.

Article of a Suspension of Arms.

So short a term as two months will still lea^e, to the enemies of peace, hopes of being able to disturb the negotiation before the end of the campaign. The king, persuaded of the good intentions of the queen of Great Britain, thinks it for the common good, to extend this term to four months.

1. It ought to be sufficient to compleat the surmounting all the difficulties of the treaty, the principal being already removed, by the firm resolution that the king, of Spain hath taken, to renounce for himself and his descendants to the crown of France, and to keep Spain and the Indies; and this renunciation shall he inserted in the treaty of peace.

2. After having established the beginning and the course of the negotiation upon a good faith and mutual confidence, of which the happy effects are already felt, we must banish all distrust, and even the appearance of suspicion, When each party comes, in their proposal, near the end that both sides propose td themselves. The king leaves the equity of the queen of England, to judge, whether the demand of putting an English garrison into Dunkirk, during the suspension of arms, has nothing in it disobliging to him; and if the public would not look upon it as a doubting his majesty’s exactness to satisfy his promises. He knows that the queen of England is very far from harbouring such a thought, having received too many proofs to the contrary. The king also having for a long time looked upon the queen as a friend, notwithstanding the continuation of the war, is persuaded that she will desist from such a demand, not only as being useless, but capable of producing an effect, contrary to the intentions of that princess.

For it is certain the aim her majesty has, is only to oblige the Dutch readily to give the king an equivalent for the fortifications of Dunkirk, which his majesty promises shall be demolished.

We must then overcome their stubbornness, and let them see, that if they persist, the damage thereof shall fall upon themselves; but it is not threatening them, to declare to them that the English troops shall keep the city, (he citadel, and the forts of Dunkirk, till the States General shall have given to the king an equivalent, wherewith his majesty shall be satisfied. The king alone would suffer by the new obstacles they will raise against the peace-; and it is by contrary ways that that republic must be constrained to become more flexible.

tliii] APPENDIX. — Negotiation for Peace: 1715. [clif

As it is the king's true intention to press the .demolition of all tke fortifications of Dunkirk in general, his majesty proposes, that immediately after the signing of the treaty of peace with the queen of Great Britain, a body of English troops shall encamp under Dunkirk; and that those troops, the number whereof shall be fixed, may jointly work wiiH bis, in razing all the fortifications.

The condition of filling. up the port, and ruining the sluices, depends, as the king has explained himself, upon the-restitution that his majesty has demanded of Tournay and its district. He renews again the same engagement. The ruin of the Sluices will occasion the ruin of the country adjacent to Dunkirk; friends and enemies will equally suffer thereby. The king could wish to save this needless destruction, which the queen of Great Britain has not perhaps enough considered. Tlis majesty is willing that this be again offered to the queen’s consideration, though he is resolved to do, upon this article, what shall be most agreeable to that princess, for the restitution of Tournay and its district.

3. The peace is necessary, to all Europe; the king desires it as a general good, aod his majesty looks upon the suspension* of arms as a means almost necessary to attain it; but he would refuse all suspension, would break likewise the negotiation of peace, if eitoer the suspension or peace depended upon the admitting the Dutch garrison into Cam bray, during' any space of time that may be. He will never consent to a proposition so contrary to his honour, to his interest, and to the good of his kingdom. Given atMarley, 10 June, 1712.

J.ettxr from the States Deputies teethe Duke of Ormonde, Jane 4, 1712.

My Lord; The States General, our masters, have ordered us to represent to you, that it is with the greatest surprise in the world, they have received from us the news of the declaration you have made, that you could not undertake any' thing before you had -received letters from England; and the refusal you have made to concur to a siege, or to a battle. They have directed us to acquaint you, that it appears to them incomprehensible and unanswerable; that by this means hold is not taken of the advantage one has over the enemy both with respect to the quality and number of the troops, and with regard to the situation of the armies; and that an apparent opportunity is neglected of obtaining, with the blessing gf God, a great advantage over the common enemy; That this occasion, Jbeing once missed, ’will perhaps neter offer itself any more; whereby the common cause will suffer a loss which can never be repaired.

Their high and mightinesses cannot in the least comprehend, that the order sent you can be so general, as to bind you on so fair an opportunity as this is, from annoying the enemy; but that it appears to them, that such orders must be understood in a good sense, to temporise a little, in case the common cause does not thereby suffer a considerable disadvantage; but not at ail to sit idle in a situation wereinaction takes away all hopes from undertaking any thing hereafter, and whereby consequently the damage becomes- irretrievable to the common cause, since the army remaining some time without doing any thing, the forage is consumed and the operations afterwards become not only very difficult, but even impracticable; besides that lime is left thereby to the enemy to intrench themselves, and to fortify their country as much as they please. ’

It is for all these reasons, my lord, that our masters have enjoined us to persuade you not to do so great a wrong and prejudice to the common cause of all the high allies, as it would be, if you should persist not to epneur any way to the operations, of the campaign, as the reason of war, and the present situation of the armies, seem to require it. They have directed us to support the aforesaid reasons, particularly with this, that the army which you command,

elru) APPfcNDEt. — ffcNfil

does ndt only consist of the national troops of the queen of Great Britain, but likewise, for the most part, of the troops in the joint pay Of her majesty and the States, oyer which it is true, that the command, Os first and chief general, belongs to you; but as they ate engaged by both powers together, to make war, and to jwt against the enemy, they cannot be withdrawn from so doing by you alone, without communicating the same to their high and toightinesses, and without their approbation, unless one will act contrary to the treaties, and to the ends for which they are engaged. They have likewise ordered tis to represent to you, fay lord, that not only the treaty of the grand Alliance among the high allies, but Also particular treaties made between the queen of Great Britain, and their high and mightinesses, oblige fcer majesty to cany on the war with vigour; but that the declaration you have made, that ybn cannot undertake any thing till further r Order, at a time that, with your communication and approbation, the army marched in Sight of the enemy, and wherein all circumstances seemed favourable to undertake something, with probable hopes of success; Such, A declaration we say, cannot he reconciled with the said treaties, ndr with the repeated assurances the queen Of GreAt Britain was pleased to give their high And mightinesses as well by her letters, as by the mouth of the earl of Strafford, her ambassador extraordinary, whereby she deckured, that her troops should act with os much vigour as should be requisite for continuing the war.

That, yourself, my lord, being sent to that end hither, gave their high aqd mightinesses the same assurauces of, during your stay at the Hague.

And that therefore they ofder ufc, to sutamon you on the good faith of treaties and alliances, and upon the aforesaid assurances, to posh on the operations of war, and to annoy the enemy as much as possible.

But in case you persist unhappily in the design not to order htr majesty’s troops to act offensively; our masters order us to ask you, my lord, if you will make any difficulty to employ the said troops to cover a siege that might be undertaken; Provided also, you promise positively to cause them to act against the enemy, if they should come to attempt any thing.

In caie, my lord, of an unexpected refusal, (hey have charged us, to protest in the most effectual manner, and in the strongest terms (as we do solemnly by this); against the irretrievable damage the State and their high allies .suffer thereby, and against the prejudice common cause undergoes by such conduct.

And, that they may know how to proceed, we must ask you positively, my lord, wherein ▼our orders strictly consists not to act, how far they reach, and now much one mdy depend upon the troops of Great Britain.

Finally, we require, oh their parts, that no hindrance be 'given to (he troops in joint pay

to art according to the reason of waf in pur* suance of the treaties and solemn engage* ments.

This, my lord, our roasters have ordered u* to represent to you by word of mouth, and m writing, that all tnfe world, and even posterity, may see, that their high and mightinesses, for from being guilty Of so great a. detriment to the common cause, as is the inaction of this day, have done all that lay In their power to prevent the inconsequences thereof, and that it must belong to others to answer for the unhappy events that might arise therefrom. We desire you, my ldrd, that you will pleAse to give us an answer in writing thereupon, as sA-tisfactory and speedy, as the importance of the affair, and the interest of all the high allies, require it.

Whitehall, 'June20, 1712. Mr. Secretory St, John to M. de Torty.

Sir; I received, the 14th of this month, 6. S. by la Vi^ne, your dispatches of the 22nd of the same month, N. S. and I only waited for the duke of Ormond’s letters to send you my answer. These letrers are arrived this mornings and at the Same time your courier put into my hands that which you did me the honour to write to me the 27th of this month.

The particular^ which the duke of Ormond gives or what has passed, are inti rely conformable to what you observed to me; And 1 have not failed raiding all the dispatches to the qtieen. Her majesty, sir, commands tale to tell you, that it is with the most sensible displeasure, she sees that the enemies to peace find still the means to retaird its conclusion, -in exposing the negotiation (Which must lead tis to it) to new difficulties and new dangers. But as her faff-j esty has taken a firm and immoveable Resolution, not tio give way, in any manner, ‘to the obstacles which shall be raised, and bn the contrary tb continue to laborir jointly with the king to re-establish the general tranquillity, she doubts nbt hat We shall be ih a condition to make abortive' this last effbrt of those, who would buy their advantages, or satisfy their particular reserittifCnt. At the cost of prolonging, the miseries of the war. I believe When you shall have read over my letter, you will bo convinced 6f this truth.

I have this moment bAeh speaking by tb# queen’s order, to 'all thejministers who are now Here, whose princes troops are in the sole pay of her majesty, or in her joint pay With the States. I have declared to them, in the name of the queen, that she will look upon the conduct or their master’s generals, rat this juncture, as A declaration of those princes either for or against her; since nothing need be done to. secure a pAaee, but to fottoW the plan which

V ,

clix]- APPENDIX^J2i#or/fiia/f»i£*oMg > [chi

the queeo ha* made, or to follow that which the emperor and the States General have formed to break the negotiations. That, her majesty could not persuade herself, tint if they would once more reflect on it, their generals would stick a moment to obey the orders of the duke of Ormond. But I declared to them that if they did, her majesty would furnish no more pay to the troops.

I have given them to understand that the courier, which I dispatch this night to the army, will carry the letters which they shall think proper to write to their general officers, upon what I just then told them, and that it was time they came to a resolution, since by the same courier the duke of Ormond would receive the queeufc orders not only to make the same declarations, but in case they should refuse to obey him, to put these declarations in’execution.

The queen, sir, persuades herself that this proceeding will hardly fail of having its effect. But she commands me at the same time to communicate to you the resolution she has taken in case some of the foreign troops persist to remain with prince Eugene's army. In this case the duke of Ormond will retire with the English 'forces, and all those that will marchoff with him, which will not be, I suppose, the least part: and will declare that the queen will not act any more against France, npr pay those that shall. And her majesty, who till now has kept measures with her allies, driven by them to such extremity as this, will think herself justified before God and men, in continuing the negotiation either at Utrecht or elsewhere, without troubling herself if they concur with it " er not. Thu?, sir, you may assure, yourself, and I have order to promise you in the name of her majesty, that if the most Christian king puts the town, citadel, and forts of Dunkirk into the queen's hands, notwithstanding all. the foreign troops, or part of them, refuse to obey the duke of Ormond’s orders, and to retire tpith him, her majesty will stick no longer to conclude her own particular peace, but leave to the other powers a set time to submit to she conditions of the plan which shall be. agreed oo by the queen and his most Christian majesty.

See here, sir, the peace is in the bands of the king: if the duke of Ormond’s whole army consents to the suspension of arms, our first project, op which we are agreed, has its effect; if they do not consent, the English troops will draw themselves, off from those of the (allies, and the foreign troops may address themselves to the States General for their subsistence, who, very far from being able to supply new charges, are not capable to bear those they have already upon their hands. In a word, Great Britain retires from the stage of the war, leaving there none but powers in a weak condition to make head against France, and the peace between these two kingdoms may be Concluded in very few weeks. These are, sir, the proposals which the queen has commanded me to make you; and she believes that his most I

Christian majesty will have his end, as much in the last as in the first plan. N If the king accepts these propositions, the queen thinks it convenient for the interest of both nations, to labour incessantly for a general suspension as well by sea as land, between Great Britain and France, to follow that which shall be established in the Low Countries.

I shall wait with impatience the return of this courier; for, sir, I must agree with you that the moments are precious in a conjuncture like this. You will dispatch at the some time, if you please, an express to the duke of Ormond that he may know what to depend on, and how to behave himself. If you signify to him that the king has given orders to the officer that commands in Dunkirk to suffer the troops of the queen of Great Britain to eater the place, the duke of Ormond will immediately do what I have been telling you. And in this case he* majesty will send from hence some regiments to take possession of that place, by which means we shall avoid many obstacles that might be formed, if this should be done by a detachment from the duke of Ormond’s army, as we had designed it should.

Since I have wrote this letter, her majesty has taken a resolution to seod the earl of Strafford directly to the array, and he. will set out tomorrow in the evening, or Sunday-morning at farthest. I am, &c. H. St. Joair.

M, July 5, 171 I receive by la Vigne the letter you honoured me with of the 20 June, O. S. and as yoq impatiently expect his return, knowing how precious every hour is in the preseut conjuncture, the king commands me not to lose a mo-, ra^nt in sending him back to you. You will not be sorry to see him returned, since he carries for you his majesty’s general approbation of the queen’s demands you explained to foe by your last letter.

You take notice, sir, of the orders her majesty has given to the duke of Ormond, the declarations he is to make, and the part be shall take to retire with the English troops, and all those that will march with him, if so be the king puts into her majesty’s hands the city, citadel, and forts of Dunkirk, when even all the foreign troops actually in her pay, (either separately, or joiutly with those of the States. General,) or a part of these troops, separate from the English to continue under the command of prince Eugene. My last letter, sir, contained the just reasons the king had to expect that all foreign troops in English pay should follow the orders and motions of the duke of Ormond, as a necessary condition fog the performance of .the. promise his majesty made the queen of com gutting Dunkirk to hec custody; but as it appears by your letter thbt her Britannic majesty, in case of a refusal on

fclxi]

the part of her allies, will no longer observe measures with them, that she thinks herself justified before God and Man, not to scruple an? longer the conclusion of a particular peace, leaving to the other powers interested in the war, a term to submit to thevconditions of the plan she shall agree upon with the king, that this peace may receive its conclusion in a very few weeks, and that Great Britain, enjoying a glorious peace, will leave the whole weight of the war to such powers whom animosity shall engage to act against France, but who at the ' tame time will be in too poor a condition to snake bead against her. All these reasons, so fully explained in your letter, being agreeable to the sentiments of his majesty; have determined him to give his orders for permitting the qaeen’s troops to enter into Dunkirk. The' messenger charged with these orders is going to carry them to Marshal Viltars, as at the same time I return la Vignetoyoru; and you may be certain the duke of Ormond will receive advice of them tomorrow the 6th of this instant. 2 hope the earl of Strafford will be with him at that time, and that the conclusion of a good

Ece, at least between France and Great tain, will immediately follow his arrival at echt. I beg leave, sir, to make my compliments to you on this occasion, and do it with the greater assurance in finding by your letter that all difficulties are surmounted.

The king, sir, very well approves of your proposition in agreeing immediately upon a general cessation of all hostilities between the two nations, as well by sea as land. Those people who have suffered so many years the burthen and misfortunes of the war, cannot too oon taste the “sweetness of the peace. '’Tis sny opinion this agreement ought to be signed at Utrecht, and I suppose you will send her majesty’s orders to her plenipotentiaries, unless you think some other method may sooner terminate this affair. i

[clxii

France, by virtue also of the full power given him, have signed a treaty of suspension of arms, the 8th of this instant August, O. S. 1713, in the following words.

As there is reason to expect a happy success of the conferences held at Utrecht, by the care of their Britannic and most Christian majesties, for the re-establishing a general peace; and as they thought it necessary to prevent all the events of war which may disturb the present state of the negotiations; their said majesties, earnestly desiring the happiness of Christendom, have agreed upon a suspension of arms, as the most certain means to obtain, that general good which they propose to themselves; and although her Britannic majesty has not hitherto been able to persuade her allies to enter into the same sentiments, the refusal they make to follow them, not being a sufficient reason for hindering his most Christian majesty to shew, by effectual proofs, the desire he has to re-establish, as soon as possible, a perfect friendship and sincere correspondence between the queen of Great Britain and himself, and the kingdoms, dominions, and subjects, of their majesties, his said most Christian majesty, after having trusted the English troops With the keeping of the town, citadel, and forts of Dunkirk, as a pledge of his sincerity, consents and promises, as the queen of Great Britain promises also on her part,

1. That there shall be a general cessation of all undertakings and military actions, and generally of all hostilities between the armies, troops, fleets, squadrons, and ships of their Britannic and most Christian majesties, during the time of four, months, to commence from the 22d of this instant August, to the 22d of December next.

2. The same suspension shall be established between the garrisons and troops, which their majesties have for the defence and keeping of their towns in all the places where their arms are acting or may act, whether it be by land or by sea, or other waters, in such a manner as if it should happen, that during the time of the suspension, the same should be violated by any of the parties, by the taking of one or several places either by attack, surprise, or private intelligence, in any part of the world whatsoever, that prisoners should be made, or any other acts of hostility committed, by some unexpected accident, such a3 those which cannot be prevented, contrary to the present cessation of arras: This contravention shall be faithfully made upon either side without delay or difficulty, restoring without the least dissimulation what shall have been taken, and setting at liberty the prisoners without asking any thing for their ransom or for their expence.

3. To prevent likewise all causes of complaints and disputes which might arise upon account of the ships, goods, or other effects, which shall be taken at sea, during the time of the suspension, it is respectively agreed, that the said ships, goods, and effects, which shall be taken in the channel, and in the

(Lj

cJxiii]

northern seas, after the space of twelve days, to reckon from the signing of the said suspension, shall reciprocally be restored on both sides. That the time shall be of six weeks for the prizes taken from the channel, the British and Northern seas to the Cape St. Vincent. And likewise of six weeks front and beyond that Cape to the Line, either in the ocean or in the Mediterranean.

Finally of six months beyond the Line, and in all the other parts of the world, without any exception or other more particular distinction of time or place.

4. As the same suspension shall beobserved between the kingdoms of Great Britain and Spain, her Britannic majesty promises, that none of her men of war, or merchants ships, sloops, or other vessels, belonging to Iter Britannic majesty, or to her subjects, shall be hereafter employed to transport or convoy into Portugal, -Catalonia, or any of the places where th<y make war at present, any troops, horses, arms, cloaths, and in general any provisions and ammunition.

5. However her Britannic majesty shall be at liberty to cause troops, ammunitions, provisions, and other necessaries, to be transported to the places of Gibraltar and Port Mahon of which she is actually in possession, and which she is to keep by the treaty of peace to be made; as also to withdraw from Spain the English troops, and generally all the effects belonging to her in that kingdom, either to transport them to the island of Minorca, or to bring them into Great Britain, without the said transports being thought contrary to the suspension.

6. The queen of Great Britain may also, without violating the suspension, lend her ships to transport into Portugal the troops of that nation, which are at present in Catalonia, and to transport to Italy the German troops, which are likewise in the same province.

7. Immediately after that this present treaty of suspension shall have been declared in Spain, the king engages himself to have the blockade of Gibraltar raised, and that the English garrison, as well as the merchants who shall be in that place, may freely live, act, and trade, with the Spaniards.

The ratifications of the present treaty shall be exchanged on both sides within the time of a fortnight, or sooner, if possible.

In testimony whereof, and by virtue of the orders and powers which we underwritten have received from the queen of Great Britain and his most Christian majesty, our mistress and master, have signed these presents, and have caused the seals of our arms to be affixed thereto. Given at Paris, August 19, 1712.

Lords Plenipotentiaries to ,

September2, 1712.

In our last of the 30ih past, we gave your lordship an account of the disposition things were in here to renew the general conferences, and that the next day we were to know of the French when we were to begin; we have since spoke with them twice, the last time this morning, but without coming to any conclusion, they thinking it necessary to return such au answer to our proposal, as appears to us to be contrary to the honour of her majesty’s speech:The case is this;

In her majesty’s speech it is expressed. That the Dutch are to hare the entire barrier as demanded in 1709, except two or three places at most.

The French ministers insist, that they must have Lisle, as an equivalent for Dunkirk, and that the same is not to be understood as one of the three places mentioned in the speech, and consequently that they must in all have four of the places mentioned in the demands of 1700,

This to us appears to be altogether inconsistent with what her majesty has declared^ and we accordingly think it contrary to our duty to bring on a conference in which such an explication is to be made.

The French ministers on the other hand have shewed us their orders, which positively require them to insist, upon the restitution of Tournay as well as Lisle, and that they by no means consent to the cession of Maubeauge or Conde,

We have in vain pressed them to speak at first in terms, as general as our proposal is conceived in; they think it necessary to be particular and express in that point above all Zithers, because they shall otherwise have tied themselves up, and given the Dutch an advantage:the result of a very long debate was, that we resolved not to proceed to a conference till this point be determined:and as the French ministers profess their orders are so plain, that they neither need nor can admit any explication, we also think the matter as plain on our side, nor can conceive from whence the expedient shallcome.

, We humbly hope our zeal for her mamsty*g honour will be graciously approved, ana fhat we shall be directed what further yre s» t«

APPENDIX. — Report relating to the

do in this matter, which we apprehend may be 1 of a decisive consequence; for we find those among the Dutch who appear to be more cordially disposed to such a peace, as may reestablish a good harmony between her majesty and the States, which they take to he absolutely necessary for our mutual preservation; we find them fully resolved either to retain Tournay and have Cond£ yielded to them, (though we think, if necessity require, they may be persuaded to let fail the latter,) or to take one of these two courses; namely, either to Come into any terms that France pleases, or continue the war at all hazards; the former may in our opinion, be more probable than the latter, the points of commerce being so very easy to be accommodated, and other equivalents not so very difficult. And if they should by such a motive of despair get the start of us, it may happen to lessen the consideration France now thews for her majesty’s friendship.

• We had wrote thus far when the French plenipotentiaries desired to come to us, and being come, acquainted us, that they had just received orders by a courier about the affront pone to M. Mesnager by count Rechteren, which directed them to desire us to let the States General know, that his most Christian majesty expects the States shall in a public manner disavow the said Count; and then remove him from the congress: they added, that this satisfaction is to precede any further negotiation.

Lord Bolingbrohe to the Lords Plenipotentiaries,

September 10, 1712.

Since I wrote what is above, I have been obliged to defer dispatching my letter, which has given me an opportunity of seeing ray lord Lexington, who is resolved to be setting out for Spain by the end of this week; so that I hope his lordship will get to Madrid in good time to be there at the assembling of the Cortes. Your lordships will, I presume, think fit to correspond with him upon all matters relating to your joint negotiation; and I believe the best Way will be to have your correspondence pass through the hands of Mr. Prior. I have given his lordship a copy of the cypher which was made for the use of the foreign ministers in any province to write to another. Mr. Prior has' likewise a copy of the same, so that your lordships may by that means more conveniently carry on the correspondence. I am now to speak to your lordships concerning the dispute . mentioned to be arisen in yours of the 2d of September, between your lordships and the ministers of France; it is certain, that at the titae when the queen communicated from the throne a general sketch of the project of peace, the French would have been glad, having Lisle as an equivalent for Dunkirk, to have saved Cond€, and Maubeuge, and to have departed from Tournay; this your lordships have reason I*'be sensible of as well as I j land you cannot

but observe, that in the plan brought hither by the abbot Gaultier, the king of France begs for Tournay, rather than insists upon it; but amongst many other ill consequences, which the unaccountable obstinacy of the Dutch has produced, and will I fear continue to produce, this is one, that the French are encouraged to refuse what they only endeavoured to save. The plan abovementioned was understood to be nothing more than the ultimatum of the offers of France, and almost every article in it might have been improved and built upon, if the allies had then unanimously resumed the conferences; but France has now gathered strength by our divisions, and is grown sanguine enough to re-establish the same plan as the ultimatum of her concessions. I say thus much to your lordships, upon a subject which is trite enough, only to introduce this proposition, that the Dutch have nobody to blame hut themselves, as I believe your lordships once very justly told them, if their terms of peace should fall short even of those contained in her majesty’s speech. Her majesty, my lords, is sensible of tiie concern which you express for her hoyour, and will not, you may be sure, suffer herself to be a party to any thing which may appear contradictory to what ehe has once advanced; but there is more in the present case, and although perhaps the yielding of Tourtfay might be reconciled to the terms ef her speech, yet should the queen consent this exposition of it, such consent would be almost a formal ac-, quiescence to the restoration of this place to France, and this, my lords, is what her jnajesty will avoid; she will by no means side with France, to tie down her allies in any instance, and it is with the utmost regret that she sees them persevere in a conduct, which must necessarily give the enemy an advantage over them: on'the other hand, the queen thinks that whilst they continue to refuse to come into her measures, she is under no obligation of entering very far into contention for them. I hope, the solution of this difficulty will came from France; and that when they have so many other quarrels to decide, that court will go back from d measure, which must involve them in a dispute with the queen. 1 had al* most forgot to say, that I, have reason to think that if the Dutch were come to some consistency amongst themselves, and it was certain what would bring them into the peace, the French would be less stiff on their score.

Lord Bolingbrohe to Mr. Prior, September 10, 1712. 0. S.

I was equally surprised and vexed to find, that by the uncouth way of explaining the queen’s sense, you 'had been led to imagine, that it was intended my lord Lexington should make any difficulty of seeing and complimenting the king of Spain as such.

We spent above three hours in penning mi *

nates yesterday upon jthis Jiead, which waslong agoadjusted* I suppose the instruction; will be at last clear; but my lord Lexington having been present at, the debate, his understanding of the matter will make amends for any dark ambiguous article which may be in them.

Dartmouth is to communicate the queen's orders herein to you, that so you may be able to satisfy the French ministers, and they to prepare the Spanish ministers; however, I will venture to Tell you in a few words what I understand is to be the measure of lord Lexington's conduct. As soon a? he arrives at Madrid, he will notify his arrival to the Secretary of State, he will, when he sees this minister, let him know, that the queen has sent him thither to compliment the king in her name, to be a witness of the several renunciations, and other acts requisite to complete the execution of the article, agreed upon as necessary to prevent the union uf the two monarchies; that after this, he is to proceed to settle such matters of commerce, and other affairs, as are for the mutual interest of both nations, and to take the character of ambassador upon him; my lord will at the same time produce his credentials, and give the secretary a copy of them if he desires it. In this conference he will further take notice of the several cessions made by the king , of France, in behalf of his grandson, to the queen; and will speak of them as points which he looks, upon to be concluded. He will likewise give a memorial of them in writing, signed by himself, to the secretary and expect fromi him, an assent in the king’s name, in writing also, and signed by the Secretary.

This seems natural, civil, and unexceptionable; but any other scheme is absurd and inconsistent with all the rest of our proceedings.

For God sake, Dear Matt, hide the nakedness of thy country, and give the best turn thy fertile brain will furnish thee with, to the blunders of thy countrymen, who are not much better politicians - than the French are poets.

I have writ in great haste a prodigious long letter to M. de Torcy, which, I believe, he will shew, you; but, for fear he should not, I inclose in this an extract of part of it, which relates to a matter that has given lord trea- surer and your humble servant no small trouble in cabinet. The copy of the plenipotentiaries dispatch of the 2d of September, which I likewise send you, will shew you how a dispute, now on foot at Utrecht, begun; you will observe that their lordships are very warm in it, and I can assure you we have those who are not a jot cooler.

The solution of this difficulty must come from you; it is matter of management and appearance more than of substance; and the court of France must be less politic than I think them at any time, and more unreasonable than I think, them at this time, not to come into ft temperament upon a matter unnecessarily started* You must begin by making M. de

’ ' V 'A' t '

Torcy nojt only to understand, but own hewi*. demands, fhe proposition which I am sure he remembers, I more than once repeated to him when I was in France, upon various occasions, and which 1 have again stated as clearly as I am able. The queen can never do any thing, which shall look like a direct restraint on her allies from demanding what they judge necessary; but as long as they act the part, which they now do, she can very justly be passive and neuter as to their intere^s; and. if her peace be made before theirs, which she yviU pot delay, for them, she can with the same justice leave them to make their own baigaiq. X^sisad-. vantage enough for France, and such an one. fairly speaking, as a year ago they would have, given more than Tournay to have been sure uf; they must not therefore press us to go further than this, nor do auy thing which may seem contradictory to what the queen delivered from the throne. That speech they have ftl-r. ways owned as the plan they submitted to, and it varies but little from that brought hither by, Gaultier.

In a word, the use which the French will make of the unaccountable obstinacy of, the. Dutch and other allies, may in several respects, and' particularly for ought I know in sbis in* stance of Tournay, give them, an opportunity of saving and gaining more than they could have, hoped for; and the queen may in t hep resent circumstances coutri>; uie passively to this end, but actively she never can in any circumstances.

I think in my own opinion, and I believe speak the queen’s upon this occasion, thut it were better the French should in the course of. the treaty declare, that whatever they intended to have given the Dutch, when the qpeeu spoke from the throne, their conduct has been such, and the situation of affairs so altered, that the king is resolved to have Tournay restored to him; I say I believe this were better, than to expect that we should consent to an exposition of the queen’s words, by which her majesty would yield die town up.

Let the conferences begin as soon as they can, I dare say, business will not be very speedily dispatched in them; in the meantime we shall go on to ripen every thing for a conclusion between us and Savoy, and France, and Spain, and this is the true point of view which the French ought to have before their eyes.

You will be very shortly, particularly and fully instructed to settle the article of Nurth, America, and those points of commerce still. undetermined; that done, the. ministers may . sign at Utretcht, as soon as they can hear from, lord Lexington.

My lord Dartmouth writes to you concern*-ing a clamour which our merchants have raised i as if under pretence of not carrying to Lisbon . or Barcelona, *des provisions de Guerra ou de, Bouche, ’ they shall be debarred from their; usual traffic of corn and fish* which at those places there are great demands for iq time

peace* as wall as. war, and without any consideration of the armies; the difficulty as to Lisbon seems to be removed by the Portuguese submitting to come into the suspension of arms, and be proposes to you an expedient as to Barcelona; but in truth that war must be ended of course now, since the queen supports it no longer, and the Dutch are recalling their fleet from the streights. The duke of Argyle is going immediately now away, and the moment he comes to Minorca he draws to him every thing belonging to the queen out of Catalonia; the imperial troops must in my opinion that moment submit, and compound for transportation; and when the war is at an end, I think there can he no pretence of quarrelling with us for carrying our goods to the people of the country.

It is now three a clock in the morning; I have been hard at work all day, and am not yet enough recovered to bear much fatigue; excuse therefore the confusedness of this scroll, which is only from Harry to Matt, and not from the secretary to the minister.

• Your credentials of minister plenipotentiary •will be sent you, together with your full powers by the next boat; and before duke Hamilton goes I will move to have you removed to lltrecht, which there will be a natural handle for, as soon as you shall settle the points of commerce, and in doing that, have given the last stroke to the finishing the treaty with France.

Make my compliments to madam Teriol, and let her know that I have, I hope, put her affair into a way of being finished to her satisfaction. I have spoke very earnestly to Matfei, and have used the proper arguments to him.

Adieu. My pen is ready to drop out of my brand: believe that no' man loves you better or is more faithfully yours, &c. Bolingbroke.

Lord Bolingbroke to M. de Torcy, Sept. 10.

O. S.

Your honour and mine, which are equally dear to me, will be equally preserved as lon£ as we keep to that which I have bad permission to tell you, concerning the queen’s intentions upon the general plan of the peace. You will remember. Sir, I represented to you that the conduct of her majesty in respect to the interest of her allies, was in some measure determined by their behaviour; that the violent measures which they have takeirto thwart the negotiation, had the effect of putting the queen in a condition of making the peace without waiting for their concurrence; that in this case her majesty would declare to them, that he. bad signed the treaty with France and

Spain; and that she would propose to them the plan brought by the abbot Gaultier, as that, upon which they must make the peace j and that for the future she would have them know, she could act no otherwise than by her good offices, as a common friend to all parties. You will also remember, Sir, that I had the honour to tell you, that in case the Dutch particularly, or the other allies, should take care of the part of entering before the conclusion of the queen’s peace, into concert with her majesty, we must then keep the more measures with them, the compassion of the people in England would be moved, and, the minister^ of the queen be obliged to make steps, which in the other case they would absolutely refuse to do.

You see, Sir, what I advanced in France by order of her majesty, and what I this day re* peat by the same order, and what you will find punctually performed.

The plenipotentiaries of the king seem to require of us something more, when they insist that the queen’s ministers should propose the holding a conference which should be opened by a proposition, which appears in some measure contrary to what the queen has said in her speech, concerning the barrier for the States, in the dispute that is arisen between your plenipotentiarie' and ours. The question is not to know whetherTournay shall be restored to the king or not, for in order to obtain this place, it is not necessary that you should begin in-making this specific declaration.

But the question is to know whether tfye queen should declare formally, and from this time, that Tournay shall, be restored to France; for that would be’declaring a consent to the explanation which your ministers would give to ibis article of the speech. Not to swell a letter too much, which seems already to become somewhat tedious, I must refer myself to what Mr. Prior will have the honour to tell you upon this head; and I will coqtent myself with saying, that as if is not difficult to find out an expedient, I hope we shall avoid every thing that might occasion a dispute between the ministers of, Great Britain and France.

The earl of Dartmouth sends twelve passports fur the ships that are ready to sail for the West Indies, which the king of Spain -desires; and Mr. Prior will immediately put them into your hands.

3. The king shall yield the island of St. Christopher to Great Britain, as’likewise Newfoundland, on condition that the town of Placentia shall be demolished, that the right of fishing and drying cod freelly and without molestation upon the said island of Newfoundland, •hall remain to the French in the same places where they used to do it. The little islands near it, and those nearest to Newfoundland shall also be yielded to England, well understood that the island of cape Breton, and others of the gulp hand mouth of the river of St. Lawrence^ of which France is actually in possession, shall remain to the king. —

England demands, That this town of Placentia shall be yielded to her in the condition it is in. — K.’s Ans.His majesty offers to leave the. fortifications of Placentia as ‘. they .are, when he yields that place to England, to agree to the demand made of the guns of Hudson's bay: Moreover, to yield the islands of St. Martin, and St. Bartholomew, to give np even the right of fishing and drying cod upon the coast of Newfoundland, Uf the English will give him back Acadia, in consideration of these sew cessions which are proposed as an equivalent.

In this case his majesty would consent that the river of St. George should be the limit of Acadia, as England has desired.

If the plenipotentiaries of the crown do refuse to admit of any expedient for the restitution of Acadia, the king rather . than break off the negotiation, will agree to their demands, that is to say, to leave Placentia fortified, and restore the guns of Hudson’s bay, well understood, that the offer of yielding of the islands of St7 Martin, and of St. Bartholomew, and that of desisting from the right of fishing and drying cod upon the coast of Newfoundland, shall be null, and looked upon as if they had not been made.

4. The king will yield the province of Acadia with the town of Port Royal and its dependencies.'to Great Britain, as also the streights of Hudson’s bay.

5. The French who shall leave the countries which are yielded above to Great Britain in the North part of America, shall have‘leave to withdraw their effects from thence:Likewise the king shall have leave to withdraw from thence the guns and all the stores of war.

After the conclusion of the peace there shall be commissioners named on both sides, as well for regulating in the space of a year the limits betwixt Canada or new France on one side, and Acadia and the lands of Hudson’s bay on the other, as likewise to agree amicably of all the reparations which are just and reasonable, claimed by the one side ojr the other,

for the wrongs received contrary to the right of peace and war.

7. The limits being once fixed, it shall be forbidden to the subjects of both crowns to pass the said limits to go by land ort>y sea the one to the other, as likewise todisturb the trade of either nation amongst themselves, and to' disturb the India nations who are allies, or have made their submission to either crown.

8. The king will give leave to the House of Hamilton, colonel Charles Dooglasse, and others, to lay before him after the peace their rights and particular pretensions, and will do them justice. — Dem.for Eng. That the duke

of Richmond may inherit from his mother. —

K.’s Ans. The duke of Richmond having obtained letters of naturalization from the king, shall enjoy, when the peace shall be concluded, the privilege annexed to the favour which his majesty has granted him.. Dem. for Eng. That the 4th article of the treaty of Riswick be abolished, and that the king shall not hinder that the affairs of religion in the empire, be regulated on the foot of the treaty of Munster.v — Ans. The king is willing in regard to England, that this affair should be regulated with the empire, his majesty not intending to derogate from the treaties of Westphalia as to matters of religion.

9. The king promises, in the name of the king of Spain his grandson, that Gibraltar and port Mahon shall remain in the hands of the English. — Dem for Eng. That there shall be

yielded to England an extent of ground, of two cannQn shot round Gibraltar and all the island of Minorca. K.’s Ans. It is with a 1 great deal of trouble that the king has made the king of Spain consent tt> give* Gibraltar to the English, the intentfon of that prince being as he has declared himself several times, not to give an inch of ground ih Spain. It will yet be more difficult to" obtain from him the least favour upon a point which is so tender at pre *

' sent, they pressing him to‘ renounce his rights to the-crown of France, and that they will have him look upon Spain as the only patrimony that he can leave to his posterity.

So that this new demand will certainly be refused, and the power which his majesty has received from the catholic king is directly contrary to this pretension.

Ashe has‘ not explained himself upon the intire cession 6f the island of Minorca,

. the king is willing to employ his good offices to obtain it as a sort of an equivalent for the ground which the English now ask about Gibraltar; and from this time his majesty promises, that on this account the whole island of Minorca shall be yielded to them.

10. After the peace shall be concluded, die English shall have the treaty for negroes, other- ' ways the agreement of Assiento for negroes, on the same conditions that this agreement

•kxni]

was made by the king of Spain to the French; so that the company which shall be established in England for this purpose, shall have the prerogative to set on shore, sell, and vent their negroes in all the places and ports of America upon the North Sea, in tbatofBue-nos Ayres, and generally in all the places and ports where the ships of the company formed m France under the name of the Assiento, had leave to enter. — Dem.; That the

French may not withdraw their effects be-fonging to the Assiento, but upon English or Spanish ships. — K/s Ans. The concerned in the company of the Assiento shall be strictly bound to the-terms of their agreement; of consequence they cannot trade directly to the Indies under pretence of withdrawing their effects: .they shall absolutely lose them, if they should be obliged to employ other ships to load them than those belonging to their company.

, The.design of the peace being to procure the mutual advantage of the French and of the English, it would not be just that one of the first advantages which it should procure for England, should be to the prejudice of the French nation. If the English will treat about the effects of the French company, they will remove by this expedient the inconvenience they apprehend.

11. The said agreement shall be for the term of thirty years, and there shall be appointed for the English company of the Assiento an extent of ground on the river De la Plata, upon which they may not only refresh their negroes,

, but keep them safe till they are sold, according to the conditions which shall be stipulated by the agreement which is to be made for the Assiento: and to hinder that this licence may not be made an ill use of, the king of Spain shall name an officer to hinder it, to whose inspection the concerned in the said company, as likewise all those whom they shall employ, •Hall be subject. — Dem, for Eng. That this ground shall be chose by the English, and that the Spanish inspector shall be suppressed. — K.’sAns. They know in England the

demands which were made of the king upon this head. His majesty has obtained them with a great deal of trouble from the . king his grandson, he cannot ask nor suffer in his name new additions to what has been already yielded in favour of the peace; if the English believe they ought to insist to obtain new advantages, they roust treat directly with the plenipotentiaries of Spain, and to this end, let them have immediately the necessary passports to come to Utrecht.

12. All the advantages, rights and privileges, which are already granted, or may hereafter be granted by Spain, to the subjects of France, or to any other nation whatever, shall likewise be allowed to the subjects of Great Britain.

IB. Hi* majesty promises likewise that all

[clxxi *

the merchandizes of the growth and fabric of Great Britain, which from the ports of Spain, where the ships for the Spanish West Indies shall be cleared, shall be sent to the Indies, shall be exempted from all customs, as well those of going in, or coming out of Spam, as those of going into the Indies.

14. All the articles above mentioned shall be extended in the treaty of peace, in the most ample manner, and the most convenient: and there shall be added all the clauses of the ces~ sations from hostilities, and other reciprocal pledges, according to what has been done iir former treaties, which shall be recited to have their former force and vigour, excepting those things whith this has derogated from; and thi» clause shall be put at the end of each instrument.

Offers of France to the Duke of Savoy, with the Demands for the D Savoy and

. the King's Answers.

1.. His right, and his rank, to the succession of Spain shall be declared and acknowledged conformable to the will of Charles the second.

— Dem. for D. of S. It is demanded that this article be put in these terms, The rank of the duke of Savoy to the succession of Spain, shall he reserved to his royal highness, according to his right? — X/r. Ans. The king is willing, on account of England, to pass the articles as it is demanded by her, notwithstanding the interest which his majesty may have, to recite and mention

o.n this occasion the will of Charles the second.

2. The king shall restore to him Savoy and the county of Nice, with their dependencies.

3. The king will moreover yield to him

Exilles and Fenestrelles with the valley of Pragmas. — Dem. for D. of S.His royal highnes *

asks that besides the vallies on the other side of Mount Geneva, in which are comprehended tfiat of Chateau Dauphin, Fort Barraux, and the territory which extends ' from that fort to the frontier of Savoy, as it is mentioned in the 4th article of his specific demands, the villages on the other side of the Rhone on the side of Savoy, the right of garrisoning Monaca/and the direct demesne of Manton and of Roquebrun. — K's. Ans.

The king cannot believe that England,

• desiring the conclusion ofji firm and 6olid peace, will give rise to new wars, in giving ', the gates of France to the duke of Savoy. He has neither right nor even an apparent pretext for to ask as he does a part of Dauphiny; he cannot support, upon any just and reasonable foundation, the pretentions which be makes upon. the estate of a third person, as is the prince of Monaco; so that his majesty thinks- that ha does very much in leaving, oubof re^ gard to England, Exelles, Fenesirelles^ < and the valley of Pnigelas, in tftfehand* ofi. tb^dukeof §avoy, v

He had even reason to think from the first proposals; that they knew in England that this prihce ought to content himself with the restitution of Savoy, and of the county of Nice, without making a further demand of these two places, which cannot belong to him by any title but by that of war, and that they are convenient for him.

4. The cessions in the Milaneze and others, made by the emperor Leopold to his royal highness, shall be confirmed.

5. His royal highness may make. such for- tifications as he shall think fit in the places ac-1 quired by the foregoing treaties, though without

derogating from that of Turin in 1596. — for D. of S. That he shall have power of fortifying all the places he shall think fit, notwithstanding the treaty of Turin. — K.’sAns, The intention of the duke of Savoy, is probably to fortify Pigneral; the interest of France has, not changed since the treaty made at Turin in 1696; it is npt of less importance than it then was, to hinder the duke of Savoy from fortifying that town:one may even say that the danger would be greater, this<prince acquiring besides Exeiles and Fenestrelles, and his strength being increased on the side of Italy.

England becoming a friend to France, ought not to be less concerned for its quiet, and the tranquillity of its provinces, than for the unnecessary aggrandizing of the, duke of Savoy.

6. The trade from France into Piedmont, and from Piedmont into France, shall be on the foot of the treaty of Turin.

7. His royal highness may have liberty to sell the barony of Essarts, and other estates and effects that he may have in France.

s 8. The king consents that his royal highness may increase his dominions in Italy, as much as he shall thiok fit.

Offers of France for Prussia; with the Demands for Prussia.; and the King’s Answers. 1

1. The king of Prussia shall be acknowledged by France.

9. The king shall let him peaceably enjoy the sovereignty of Neufchatel and Vaiengin, with promise never to disturb him in this possession, nor to give any sort of assistance to those who would dispute it with him. — Dem. for Pr. — That the counties of Neufchatel and Vaiengin, be acknowledged as members of the Helvetic body, by the consent of his majesty. — K.’s Ans. This novelty does ^iot depend on the consent of the King, all the Helvetic body is concerned in this proposition; it will not be unanimously received by all the members who compose it; it wiH be the interest of several to oppose it, and perhaps even all the Protestant cannons will not be of the same mind.

The counties of.Neufchatel and Vaiengin are allies of the Swiss; the king will pro-

mise to acknowledge them abd treat then* on that foot.

3. The subjects of the crown of Prussia shall enjoy, as to their trade in France, the same advantage? which shall be granted to the sabjectS of her Britannic majesty, and those of the States General j on condition it shall he ciprocal.

4. The king shall fevotir with all his power the pretensions of Prussia on the cantoOii of Gelder, the town and the'country of Ercklens, of which she makes a demand, on condition that it costs France nothing to indemnify these who would dispute this possession with Prussia *

5. The king will give ad far as twelve hundred thousand livres, French money, to this prince to buy his right to the principality of Orange. — Dem. for Pr. That it shall be in his chtoice,

to take the money which is offered, o¥ the frontier which he demands in Franche Comt6. He offers only to leave the king the castle of Tbex, in consideration of an •eqqivalent. Moreover that the lands of the House of Chalons shall be adjudged to him, and that all the edicts and decrees which have been given against the Protestants of Orange shall be revoked. — K.’s Ans. The king thinks he ‘ does much, and that he gives a particular, mark of his consideration for England, to give twelve hundred thousand livres to this prince, under pretence of buying hie rights, which his majesty knows he cannot make use of lawfully against those who havo pretensions to the principality of Orange.

There is then no choice betwixt this offer, and a preterision so ill grounded as \ this of the pretended frontier, which the ministers of Prussia, have made a demand of in Franche Comt£.

The sum oF twelve hundred thousand livres, which is offered to their master, is a present which the king is willing to make him, for the good of the peace, and tty colour it only with a pretext of buying his rights to the principality of Orange; for otherwise the king would have no other answer to make, than to give assurances, that he would leave those who have pretensions to the principality of Orange, the liberty to follow them, before the tribunals who ought to judge from them.

This- answer is the only one he can make on the subject of the lands of the House of Chalons, of which not any one has the appearance of sovereignty, and of consequence no pretence to withdraw ' themselves from the jurisdiction oi the com-

mon judges.

His majesty is accountable to no one for the edicts and decrees he gives for the domestic order of his kingdom.

6. If this prince Accepts the conditions above-mentioned, the king mil give him the title of majesty.

7. The king consents, and demands himself, that the thirteen cantons should be included in die general peace.

Offers ofFtLXveufor Portugal, the De-

mand* for Portugal; and the Answers. v

1. The king will turn into a final treaty, the provisional treaty concluded betweenFrance and Portugal in 1700, reserving, to himself the free navigation of the river of Amazons, which is to be in common between the two nations. — Don. for Por. That the advantages which hare been promised to him by the House of Aus-, . tria, as wpll in Spain as in the Indies, be granted to him, viz. The towns of Badajoz, Alcantara, Albuquerque, and Valencia in Estramadura; those of Bayona, Vigo, Tuy, and Guardia in Galicia.

That all what is betwixt the river de la Plata and the Braziles be yielded to him, so that this river may serve for limits to the two countries.

That king Philip the 5th yield to him for a barrier Coria, Ciudad Rodrigo, Pueblia de Canabria, and Montery, with their depen- dencies.

Moreover, that Spain pay what is due to the ancient Portugal company of the Assiento; of which England and the States General are guarantees.

Lastly, That France yield to him the lands of Cape de Nord in South America, notwith* standing any provisional or final treaty. — K's Ans.. If the king of Portugal had conquered Spain, or contributed by mighty armies . to bring it under the obedience of the archduke, he would not make larger demands than those contained in this article. The catholic king will give nothing to the . Portuguese in Spain.

It is not probable that he will be more easy as to the demands they make in the Indies. This is an article to be discussed "between the plenipotentiaries of Spain and Portugal, as also the accounts which are to be adjusted of what is due to the ancient Portugal company of the Assiento.

One must only take notice, that if the pretensions of the Portuguese were listened to, the catholiq king would have" only the name of king of Spain; hut that in reality his kingdom would be shared with a powerful enemy; that for to buy an uncertain and dangerous estate, they will, oblige him to renounce his rights, and those of his posterity, to the, monarchy of France.

The king does a great deal for the Portuguese, by his agreeing that the provisional treaty, concluded at Lisbon iri 1700, should be turned to a final treaty; it is all what his majesty cad grant them: they asked for no more when they signed the treaty of an offensive alliance with him and the king of Spain.

Offers of France for the House of Austria and the Empirewith the Demands of the

House of Austria, and of the Empire; and the King’s Answers.

^ 1. The Rhine shall be the boundary be-

twist France and the Empire; so that the king will return Brisac and*Fort de Kell, in the con* dition they are iu, will yield Landau in the condition it is in, will demolish all the forts he is in possession of on the other side of the Rhine and in the Rhilie, Fort Lewis to be comprehended amongst them, as also that of la Pile near Strasburg; on condition, and not otherwise, that the king shall retain all what he is in possession of on the side of the river, agreeable to the treaty ofRyswick. —

That Strasburg be returned, Honingen, and New BrisacTbe demolished.

Tbdt Alsace do notremain in the hands of France; but according to the interpretation which the Empire and the'House of AustHa do give to the literal meaning of the treaty of Munster. — K.*s 4ns- The king will keep Strasburg, which was yielded to his majesty, not alone as a consequence of the right which the cession of the Alsace gave bins to that town, but likewise for an exchange for Fribourg, Brisac, and of the right of garrisoning of Philipsburgh, which hp majesty acquired by the treaties of Westphalia and Nimeguen.

The fortifications of ‘New Brisac shall subsist, this place being necessary fora barrier for France, when she returns Old Brisac to the House of Austria.

There is no other interpretation to ha given to the treaty of Munster, as to the possession of Alsace, than the meaning which was understood by the ambassadors and ministers who signed the treaties of Nimeguen andRyswick.

2. The king shall acknowledge the elector of Hanover.

3. The elector of Treves sljall be reinstated in the possession of his town of Treves, and generally in all what belongs to him. — Demfor Aus. He demands his re-establishment at

grand prior of Castile, and the restitution of the fruits, which he pretends have only been sequestered. — K.’s The king promises to obtain from the king of Spain, that the grand priorship of Castile shall be returned to the elector of Treves.

As to the restitution of the fruits, bit majesty promises his offices to procure it,

. not knowing the custom of Spain in such cases; and this is another, point to be discussed with the plenipotentiaries^ that crown.

4. The king consents, if the Empire thinks' fit, that the landgrave of Hesse Cassel be put in possession of Rhinfelt, St. Gour, and Kalz, ‘ on condition that matters of religion are kept onthe same foot they now are. — Dem.for

It is demanded that the article of religion be decided by the Empire. — K.’s A ns. As the matter relates particularly to the Empire, the king consents it should be referred to ' its decision.

As to what relates to the House of Austria in particular, the king promises, that the king of Spain shall yield to them the kingdoms of

Naples anil Sardinia, the four. places in Toscany; and a *, to the duchy of Milan, that of it, which shall pot be yielded to the duke of Savoy.

. The Spanish Netherlands, excepting, the town and territory of Gueldre, which are to be. Jqept by Prussia, as it is explained above.-r-Dew. for Aus. Sicily is .demanded for the . House of Austria. — K/s Ans. The king and the king of Spain not only engaged to the elector of Bavaria to reestablish him in his (|ominion8, but also to make him, an’amends for the losses he has sustained during the course of tins present wai>

It isqn this account that the catholic king has yielded to him the Spanish Netherlands if it must be that the, elector must desist from them for the good of the peace, the king and the king of Spain are obliged to.make him some.other amends; , the kingdom of .Sicily is the only state which Spain can give to this priqoe, and to satisfy the engagements entered into with him.

It is the more necessary to stipulate this, condition, being it appears that the Empire oppose his being re-established in his* rank of first elector; and that it is demanded that the Upper Palatinate should be kept . by the elector Palatine, and after him by prinonCharles of Neubonrg, his brother; not to return to the elector of Bavaria or his children, but after die death of these princes.

6. The whole on condition that the electors of Cologne and Bavaria be re-established in their dominions, dignities, goods, and moveables, &c. — Bern, for Jus. They will not be against the. duchy of Bavaria’s being returned to the elector of that name, and that he shall be the ninth and last elector, on condition that he shall give up his pretensions to the Upper Palatinate, and the dignity of first elector, without hopes of enjoying it, but after the death of the elector Palatine, and of prince Charles of Neubourg, his brother.

. And as to the elector of Cologne, when he shall be reinstated in his dominions, it shall be in the choice of the allies whether they will garrison the town of Bonn, or not. — K.’s Ans. Though this condition be prejudicial to the elector of Bavaria, the king* is willing . to consent to it, allowing the amends of the kingdom of Sicily, because the title of king wilL wipe off what is shocking, in being the last elector, which they will give him instead of the first place he had ip the electoral college.

His majesty proposes, that the fortifications of Bonn should be demolished; and this expedient seems more suitable to him, than to put a garrison in that place, which does not depend on the elector of Cologne.

• T. A general pardon shall be granted reciprocally to the subjects of all the parts of the Spanish monarchy, who shall have followed 'different .parties in this war, with restitution of their honours and estates.

the King’s Answers *

1. The Catholic Low Countries, except what part the king is to keep, - and the exception dbovementioned of Gelder, shall belong in property to the House of Austria.

2. The harrier shall bfe fortned out of the Spanish Netherlands, as they are now possessed by the allies, to which Luxemburg shall be added, reserving the principality of thirty thousand crowns per ann. given by the king of

Spain to madam the princess des Ursitti, Namur, Charleroy, Newport, " Ypres, and its chatelane, Furnes, and Furnambac, Knocque, Menin, and Its district; on condition that Lille, in the state it now is in, with its dependencies, shall be returned to France as an equivalent" for the demolition of Dunkirk and Tournay, with the district of Tournay, Douay, Bethune, Aire, St. Venant, knd Bouchain, ib*the Condition they are in, with what belongs to them, as likewise all the guns and stores of war, which shall be found in them, in exchange for the places which France adds to fortify the barrier, and those which will be yielded by the elector of Bavaria^ who is actually in possession of them. — Dent, for the$t. Gen. Besides the places offered Yor

the barrier, the cession of Tournay, and the district of Tournay, is demanded; as likewise Condt *, the gOns, and stores of Waf, Which are in the places which are to be yielded.

Moreover, a renunciation for ever, for all the kings, princes, and princesses of the blood royal of France, to all rights present or to come, or which possibly may, .to all what shall compose the barrier in whole or in part. . . 4

It is refused to 'agree about the principality granted or reserved for the princess dcs Ursini. — K?s Ans. The king insists upon the restitution of Tournay, and the district of Tournay, as being essential to secure the barrier which France has occasion for on the side of the Low Countries.

This barrier is the more important, being the strength of the House of Austria becomes formidable, by the re-uuiting so many considerable dominions in the person of the same prince. Every thing is to be feared from so dangerous a neighbour, who applies himself more to his affairs than any of his predecessors; who glories in following the steps of Charles the 5th, and does not conceal the design he has to aggrandize himself. It cannot be doubted neither, but that be will be powerfully assisted by the republic of Holland; experience having shewn, that far from being afraid of the power of the House of Austria, this republic makes its glory and safety consist in multiplying the number of the dominions of this powerful House. '

: The 6ame reason of securing the frontier of his kingdom, requires that the king

clxxxij APPENDIX.~A^o<2a<z<»w J&r Peae$: 1715. [clxxxii

should keep the town of Cond£; and his majesty will hot relax any tiling uponthia article. ”

Being he knows all the. consequences of it, he will be very sensible of the pleasure which England will give him, in contributing that To urn ay and its district may be restored, and causing all demands about Condd to he laid aside: and to give real tokens of it to that crown, his majesty will oblige himself, that if Tournay and its district are returned to biiq, that all demands about Cond6 be laid aside, and that he keeps that place by the peace. Jki this case he will consent, purely out of regard to England, to fill up the port of Dunkirk; though his majesty being sensible of the damage that this article, so strenuously demanded by the English, will be to him, has always refused to agree to it.

* He will moreover consent to demolish the fortifications of Burgh St. Dinox, with Fort Francois, which belongs to it: and even, if it is necessary, to, yield this demolished town to the prince to whom the Netherlands shall belong.

He will likewise consent to leave the cannon' and the stores of war which shall be found in the places he will yield, on condition that the cannon and stores of war do likewise remain in the places which shall be yielded to him, and belong to his majesty.

The agreement ought to be reciprocal j either to leave all the artillery, and what belongs to it, in the places which are to be yielded, as well on the king’s side, as on that of his enemies; or to regulate the quantity vyhich shall be left in each of the places. ' The renunciation which is demanded of the king, is a elapse taken out of the prelx-liminqries of 1709. There woiild be many reasons to refuse it, ’ as unnecessary, and even as absurd; but his majesty is willing to agree to it. 1 Being the principality reserved of the princess des Ursini has no relation to the public affairs, the king desires the difficulty on this head may be surmounted.

' 3. As to the trade of (Spain and the Indies, it shall be on the same foot it was in the veign of Charles 2. And as to that of France; it shall be as it is|stipulated by the treaty of Ryswick; end the Tariff of 1664'shall be followed excepting the four species of merchandize, on the conditions which shall be agreed upon. — X)em.for St., Gen.

Instructions for our 'right Trusty and well ‘ loved cousin and counsellor Viscount

BoiingbrOke, whom we have appointed to go

to the Court of’Prance.' ‘

i, are immediately to repsjr ty thfcourt of

France; and being arrived there, to demand anaudience of his most christiari m^esty . *

' You are 'to present to this prince our letter which is herewith delivered to yon; and to ad* quaint him that we observe, with great concern that new difficulties have arisen, and new dek lays have been created in the negotiation, which we thought oh the point of being concluded!. That we have sent you over fully instructed in all dur intentions, and fully authorised to treat and settle every thing necessary to remove thU obstructions which hinder the general suspension of arms from taking place; That you are likewise iinpowered to concept with his minisJ-ters the most proper means of preventing such other differences as can be now foreseen, and of settling the treaty of peace in such a course as may bring it to a happy and speedy conclusion.

You are to add the assurances of our earnest desire to sde a perfect good understanding between the two nations restored:and to use all other terms of civility, which may be proper in our name.

.When you proceed to treat with the ministers at this court, you will begin, by acquainting them, that we have directed and impowerel you to couclnde and execute the convention for a general suspension of arms by sea ami land, between us and France and-Spain; And we do hereby authorise you accordingly to agree to the saihe for two, for three, or four months, or to continue it till the conclusion of the peace.

But whereas we have not yet received satisfaction in those demands which we have thought fit to make in the behalf of the duke of Savoy; And whereas the settlement of the term for the suspension of arms must in great measure be governed by the time, which the complete execution of the article for preventing the Union of the two monarchies of France and Spain, will require: you are therefore, before you sign the convention aforesaid, td expect positive assurances that the terms which we demaod of France and Spain shall be made good to his royal highness, and as far forth as possible to adjust and determine the forms of the several renunciations and settlements.

, As to the barrier which his royal highness demands and judges necessary for his security On the side bf France, yoa are not required to insist to have those articles immediately granted which have been hitherto peremptorily refused by his most Christian majesty; nor on the other hand, are you to agree to any thing which may foreclose the duke of Savoy from negotiating for himself. This point we chuse to leave to be settled between the two powers Concerned, but you will not fail to recommend to the, French ministers to hasten the conclusion of it, insinuating to them that though you can agree to the suspension of arms without waiting to have this barrier intirely settled; yet that you do not imagine there will be any possibility of prevailing on us to sign (he peace with Frauce a^d Spain! unless

clxuciii] APPENDIX — Report .[clxxxir

lull satisfaction be given to His royal highness, and unless we can take him along with us in the doing thereof.

There seems to be little or po difference be* tween what has been proposed from hence, and what is agreed to on the part of Fran'ce, concerning the right to be established in the duke of Savoy and his children, immediately after Philip and his children, to the succession to the Crown Qf Spain and the West Indies.

You are therefore to have this article again explained, and to bring it as near as possible to the terms made use of in the memorial drawn by the count de BJaffei upon this subject.

Concerning the cession of Sicily, you are to insist that it be made in the manner demanded .by us; and that this act, as well as those necessary on the precedent head, be finished at the same time as the renunciations and settlements of the crowns of France and Spain shall be made. '

You are to refuse to consent to defer the actual surrender of this island to his royal highness till the general peace; But you are at liberty to agree that he shall not take possession thereof, until his and our peace be made with France and Spain. In other respects, you will bring this article likewise as near as possible to the terms made use of by the count de Maffef in his memorial.

It seems too indifferent to either side, whether a formal suspension of arms be agreed to between France and Savoy, or not to have this matter much insisted on; and there may be some reasons why in prudence the duke of Savoy's accommodation should be yet a while concealed. You will therefore have the" less regard to this point, and treat for his royal highness, upon the supposition and condition of his coming into the peace when we shall do so. And whereas it has been surmised that his royal highness might think of exchanging Sicily for some other territories contiguous to his own, which would by no means he agreeable to our design, or to the interests ofour kingdoms; you may therefore consent to an article to prevent the exchange or alienation of this kingdom from the house of Savpy.

As to the second point which you are to adjust, as far forth as is possible, we have directed what has beOn prepared by the civilians Upon this subject, to be put into your hands; of which you will make the best use you are able, and you will endeavour to agree the several forms in such manner, and to concert 'such measures for the dispatch of them, that when the persons whom we shall think fit to appoint to be witnesses of these renunciations and settlements, shall arrive in France and 'Spain, there may be as little room as possible left for dispute or delay.

The most Christian king being very earnest to obtain some advantageous conditions for the JaW elector of Bavaria; you are to inform the Trench ministers, that we shall readily agree to have this prince restored to all which he enjoyed in tfc empire, except his rank of fiat

elector, and except the Upper Palatinate, both, which are to remain and belong to the elector Palatine. We think this a sufficient concession on our part in favour of the prince above-mentioned, who being in possession of Namur, Luxemburg, Charleroy, and Newport, use may be made thereof in the general treaty of peace: and he may have an opportunity there, in exchange for these places and countries, to obtain something farther for himself-

You may however, if you shall find it for our service, consent on our part, that he have the kingdom of Sardinia yielded to him; for the obtaining whereof, the possession just now mentioned seems to be an adequate security.

In treating of the several matters entrusted to your management, you are to have especial care to avoid entangling us in any new engagements; and for that purpose, yoq are to say and to repeat, that we shall willingly enter into the common guarantee *for supporting that settlement of Europe which shall be established by the general peace; but that we will not be tied down to any stipulation which may oblige us to make war, and especially with our old allies, in order to procure this settlement. It is advantage enough to France that the conduct of our allies has made it reasonable, just, and even necessary for us to withdraw ourselves out of the present war.

After you shall have received sufficient satisfaction in all the points before mentioned, you may proceed to speak to such articles as relate particularly to the interests of Great Britain, and endeavour to have such of them, ns there may appear to be any doubt concerning, explained in the most advantageous manner.

You will likewise do your best to discover upon the several parts of the general plan of peace, what the real ultimatum of France may be; and upon this head you are to say, that when we shall conclude our treaty, it may be expedient to fix a time for the allies to comein. During which, our good offices shall be employed to reconcile the disputes which may arise, and to render the peace general. But we shall not do any thing like imposing the scheme offered by France upon our allies, or debarring them from the liberty of endeavouring to obtain still better terms for themselves.

When vou shall have concluded the convention for the suspension of arms, you may dis-

Jatch to our trusty and well beloved sir John ennings knight, our admiral, and commander in chief of our fleet in the Mediterauean, to our trusty and well beloved William Chetwynd esquire, our envoy extraordinary to the republic of Genoa, and to the commander in chief of our troops in Catalonia, our orders *, which are herewith put into your hands; and at the same tune you are to concert with the ministers of France, not only the safe retreat of the empe-•ror’a forceg out of Catalonia, if his imperial

dxxxvl APPENDIX. — Negotiations for Peace: 1715. [clxxxti

majesty shall think fit to withdraw them, hut also the inarch of the Portuguese troops, which are now serving there, back to their own couu-try.

We have likewise ordered fifty passes signed by us in blank, to be put into your hands, which you will exchange against the like number, as soon as the suspension shall he agreed; And you- may acquaint the French ministers that more will be sent from hence by every opportunity. Given at our court at WindsoeCastle, July 31, 1712, in the 11th year of our reign.

Hague, June 5, 1712, N. S.

Madam; After all the proofs which your majesty has given during the course of your glorious reign, of your great zeal for the public good, and of your adherence to the common cause of the high allies^ after so many marks you have had the goodness to give us of your tender affection, and of your friendship to our republic, and after the repeated assurances'you have given us, and that very lately too, of your intentions, that your troops should act against the common enemy, until the war was concluded by a general peace: it is impossible we should not be surprised and afflicted by two declara-v tions we have lately received one .after another, in the name of your majesty; the first by the jduke of Ormond, your genera ), that he could . undertake nothing without new orders from you; the other by the bishop of Bristol, your plenipotentiary to the congress'at Utrecht; that your majesty perceiving that we did not janswer as we ought the proposal which you had made us, and tljat we would not act in concert with your ministers, on the subject of peace, you would take your measure^ apart; and that you did not look upon yourself to be now nuder any obligation whatever with respect to

US.

.As soon as we had notice of those declarations, we sent orders to our minister, who has the honour to reside at your majesty's court, to represent to you the reasons, of our surprise, and the consequences of those declarations, and to request you with that respect which we always had, and which we shall for ever entertain for your royal person, that you give other orders to the duke of Ormond, that he may act with all possible vigour, according to the exigency of the war; and that your majesty would have the goodness to entertain other sentiments of us, than those which the bishop of Bristol has declared to our plenipotentiaries at Utrecht.

But the more we consider those declarations, the more important we find them, and the more , we apprehend the consequences: Therefore we could not forbear applying ourselves by this letter directly to your majesty, hoping that you will Consider it, as we promise ourselves you will, both from your great prudence and

wisdom, and from your so much famed zeal for the public welfare; particularly From your usual friendship and affection for us and our republic.

We protest before all things, that as we ever had a true friendship, as well as the highest res* pect for your majesty, and a sincere affection to all your interests, with an earnest desire to live in a perfect good understanding and union with you:we have still the same sentiments, and shall always preserve them, wishing for nothing more, than to be able to give your majesty the most convincing proofs of it.

After this, we pray your mqesty to consider, according to your great penetration, whether we have not just ground tp be surprised, when we see a stop put, by an order in your majesty's name, without our knowledge, to the operations of the confederate army, the finest and strongest which perhaps has been in the field daring the whole course of the war, and provided with all necessaries to act with vigour; and this after they had marched, according to the resolution taken in concert with your majesty's general, almost up to the enemy, with a great superiority both as to the number and goodness of troops, and animated with a noble courage and zeal to acquit themselves bravely; so that in all human appearance, and with the divine assistance, which we have experienced so visibly on so many other occasions, we should have been able, either by battle or sieges, to gain great advantages over the enemy, to have bettered the affairs of the allies, and to facilitate the negotiations of peace.

We flatter ourSelves indeed with the hopes which the duke of Ormond has given ns, that in a few days he expects other orders; but in the mean time we are sorry to see one of the finest opportunities lost, being uncertain whether we shall have another so favourable, since the enemy have time given them to fortify themselves and take their precautions, while the army of the allies lies still without action; and consuming the forage all round, deprive themselves of the means of subsisting tor. time to come, in those places, where by concert, the operations of the campaign were designed; which may make such enterprizes impossible hereafter, as were practicable now, and consequently render the whole campaign unsuccessful, to the inestimable prejudice of. the common cause of the high allies.

Certainly when we consider the army, as it really is composed of the troops of your majesty and the other allies, joined together by common concert, to .act for the greatest advantage and furtherance of‘ the commop cause, and the assurances which your majesty < had given us by your letters, by, your ministers, and last of all, by your general the duke pfOrmond, of you* intentions, that your, troops should he ordered to act with their usual vigour, as well as the engagements into which your majesty is entered, ; pot only with respect to us but also separately and jointly with us, in respect to the ether allies, it is very difficult for

* APPENDIX.-ri^pprt rffotm# to tbf . [clxxxviii

us tQ conjecture and conceive, how an order, so prejudicial to the common cause, given so suddenly without out knowledge, and undoubtedly too without the knowledge of the other allies, can agree and consist with the nature of an alliance, and with those assurances and engagements just now mentioned. For though according to the declaration of the bishop of Bristol, your majesty holds yourself to be disengaged from every obligation with regard to US, it is plain that the matter now in question, is not our particular interest or advantage, but that of all the allies, who will suffer by the prejudice which an order, so little expected, must needs bring to the common cause.

But, madam, we cannot forbear telling your majesty, that the declaration made by the, bishop of Bristol at Utrecht has no less surprised us, than that of the duke of Ormond in the army. It appears to us so extraordinary, that we know not now to reconcile it with the great goodness and kindness which your majesty, has always honoured us with; and not being able to conceive how such a sudden change could happen with respect to us; we Wf not only surprised, but afflicted at it. We have carefully examined our conduct, and find nothing ip it that can have given ground to {hat dissatisfaction which your majesty expresses with us by this declaration.

From the very first day that your majesty ascended the throne, we testified all the deference that you could desire from a state in friendship and alliance with you. We carefully sought after your amity and affeetion; and considering the happy effects, which a good intelligence, harmony, -and union, betwixt your majesty andus, and the two nations, might produce, and have really'produced, and the advantage which resulted from thence to both, as well as to the common cause of all the allies, we made it our business heartily to cultivate them, and more and more to gain yoqr majesty's confidence, and to conform ourselves to your sentiments as much as possibly we could.

We think that we gave a signal proof of this, particularly with regard to the negotiations of peace, since not only after we were informed of the conferences formerly held in England upon this subject, we did expect that your majesty would give us an account of them:having this firm confidence in yoqr friendship for, qur republic, and in your ?eal for the good of the common cause, that nothing would be done to prejudice us and the other allies; but also when your majesty communicated to us the preliminary articles signed by M. Jtfesna-ger m England, and when you proposed to qs the calling and bolding a congressfar a general peace, ana required of us to graqt, for this end, Hepessajy passports for tfia enemy's ministers, .we consented to it, thopgh toe had many reasons .which.!0 qs seemed very well grounded, npt to enter into , such a treaty .without a better found- i nation, or at least without the concurrence, of; 4he Ms? i.hut tfg.

jesty's sentiments to our own, in order tp give you a new proof of our deference.

We did no less with respect to the difficulties which were started oh the subject of the treaty of mutual guaranty for the succession of the Protestant line to your majesty'^ kingdoms, and for our barrier; a treaty of such importance to the two nations, that we look upon it as the strongest tie that could bd thought on to unite for ever the hearts and interests of both, concluded after the maturest deliberation, and ratified on both sides in the most authentic form:for though we might have stood to the treaty as it was, yet we entered into a negotiation upon those difficulties, and particularly on the point of the Atpiento, concerning which we gave our plenipotentiaries such instructions, that we ho longer doubted but all the difficulties would have .been adjusted to mutual content, and that we should thereby have intirely regained your majesty's confidence, and the rather, because in the first place, when the meeting of a congress for a general peace was in hand, your majesty declared to us by your ambassador, that you desired no more than our concurrence in that single point, and this only mark of our confidence, and that then you would give us strong and real proofs of your affection towards us, and of your upright intentions with respect to the commoncaust of all the allies; and that afterwards, when the difficulties about the succession and thebarr rier were raised) your majesty did likewise assure us, that if we would remit something upon the most essential points, and particularly about the affair of the Assiento, it would be the true way to re-establish a mutual confidence, which being onCe restored, your majesty would take particularly to heart the interest of this State, and act in conjunction with us, in the whole negotiation, to obtain an honourable, good, and sure peace.

Bqt we find ourselves very much out in our expectation; since, at the very same time, when we made the greatest advances towards your meje^ty, and that we did verily believe we should pome to an agreement about the points jp difference, we see the earl of Strafford gong without finishing that affair, we see the army stopt in the beginning of its career, and we hear a declaration, by. which your majesty looks Upon yourself to be disengaged from an obligations witfi qs; for which the reasons alleged are, That we liaye not aiiswered, as we ought, the advances your majesty made towards usi, and that We would not act ip concert with your ministersaboqt thepeace.

If your majesty will he pleated to look with a favourable apd equitable eye upon oqr conduct, we flatter ourselves, and have a firm confidence, that Fill find nothing in it which can give ypu ^uch ^advantageous ideas anff thoughts of qs, but that ypq will rather find that

5e have performed, aqd do still perform, all (at we are bound to, as gopd and faithful aj-ffps, apd particularly ^0 Jour majesty.

clxxxix]

iu&cient t6 persuade you of it, but we must add, that bating always esteemed ybur majesty's affection, and a pood harmony betwixt the two nations, as one of the strongest supports of our state, and of the protestant religion, and a$ one of the most effectual methods to maintain and advance our common interests, and those of. the whole confederacy; and this sincere opinion being firmly imprinted on our hearts, we were never backward to communicate and consult in all confidence with your majesty and your ministers upon the affairs of tbie peace, according to the foundations laid down in the grand alliance and other treaties; we declare that we have always been inclinable aiid ready to do it, and are so still, as far as we cau, without prejudice to the ofher allies, and without departing from or acting against the engagements, treaties, and alliances, which we have entered into.

But, madam, all the proposals hitherto made to us upon that .subject were coached in very general terms, without communicating to us the result of the negotiations betwixt your majesty's ministers and those of France, nor even your majesty’s thoughts atymt the subject, which we ought to have concerted together; it is true that jo some of the last conferences your majesty’s ministers demanded to know whether ours were furnished with a full power, and authorised to draw up a plan for the peace; hut it had been just, -before such a thing was demanded of us, that they should have communicated the result of the negotiations so long treated of betwixt your majesty’s ministers and those of the enemy; or at feast they should have told us your majesty’s thoughts.

Had that plan related only to your majesty’s interests and ours, we should perhaps have beep in the wrong not to have forthwith come into it, though even in that case the affair would not have been without its difficulties, since the least notice of it which should have come to the enemy must have been very prejudicial; but as the plan in question concerned the interest of all the allies, and almost all Europe, ; we had very strong apprehensions, that as the particular negotiations betwixt your majesty’s painisters and those of France, ancl the readiness, with which we consented to the congress at Utrecht, andt0 the giving of passports to the Enemy’s ministers, had already occasioned, abundance of suspicions and much uneasiness to his imperial majesty and the other allies; we «ay, we apprehend that his imperial majesty add the other allies coming to know* (which would have been very difficult to conceal from them) the concert betwixt your majesty’s ministers and ours for a plan of peace, and that before the ministers of France had given a specific answer to the demands of the allies, their suspicions and uneasiness would have increased, and that way of proceeding might have given .them grouod to entertain prejudicial thoughts, as if it had been the intention of your majesty, nnd us to abandon the grand alliance and the’common cause, or at least that we alone took 9 ' ‘

Peace: 1715.

nj»oA us to determine the fate of all the other allies; by which his imperial majesty and the other confederates might have been pushed oh to separate measures, and to take such steps as Would be no Ways agreeable to your majesty's interest nor ours.

We thought these reasons strong enough to justify our conduct to your majesty on this head, and if we did not enter, with all the readiness which you might have wished for, into the concert proposed, we hope that, at most your majesty will look upon our backwardness only as an excess of prudence, or of scruple* and not m the least as a want of confidence in your majesty, while the allies might have considered it as a departing from the treaties, and particularly from the eighth article of the grand alliance: we also hope that your majesty (for the reasons here alleged) will lay aside those hard thoughts of us, as if we had not answered, as we ought, the advances which your majfcsty made towards ns, and that we would not act in concert with your ministers upon the subject of the peace. But, madam, though your majesty should not acquiree in our reasons (of which, however, we cannot doubt) we pray jour majesty to consider whether that be sufficient for your majesty to think that you are disengaged From nil obligations with respect to us.

Had we acted against, and contravened the engagements and treaties which we had the honour to conclude with your majesty, we might have expected from your goodness and justice that you would have represented those contraventions to us, and not have looked upon yourself to be disengaged till such time as we. had refused to give ml necessary redress; but. as we did no ways engage to enter with your majesty into a concert, to draw up a plan of peace, without the participation of the other members of the grand alliance, the backwardness we have shewn upon that head cannot be looked upon as a contravention of our engagements, and therefore cannot serve to disengage your majesty from yours, with respect to us; since we are verily persnaded that we have fully answered all our treaties, and all our alliances, both with your majesty and with the high allies in general, and that we have done more in this present war than could in justice and equity have been expected from us; all the difference betwixt your majesty and us in this point is. no more, if rightly considered, than a disparity of sentiments.

In truth, madam, if for such a cause betwixt ‘ potentates allied and united together by the strongest and strictest lierof alliance, interest, and religion, any one of those potentates could quit all their engagements, and disengage themselves from all their obligation?, there is no tie so strong which may not he broke at any time, and we know of no engagements that could be relied on in time to come.

We assure ourselves, that when your majesty considers the consequences, you will pot persist in the declaration which the bishop of Bristol nas made; we beseech you with dll the

mm

respect, and all. the earnestness of which we are capable, that you would not; and also that you would be pleased to revoke the order giveo to the duke of Ormond, if.it be not revoked already, and tbatyou would authorize him to act according to occurrences, and as the exigency of the war and the advancement of the commbn cause shall require,

• We also request you, madam, to communir cate to us the result of the conferences betwixt

Jrour ministers and those of the enemy, or at east your thoughts upon the peace; and we will endeavour to give your majesty all imaginable proofs ofour deference for your sentiments, and of our sincere desire to preserve your valuable friendship as much as we can, without acting contrary to the faith of the engagements into which we have entered by treaties and alliances with your majesty and other potentates.

We are £rmly persuaded, that it is not your majesty’s intention in any manner to break them, since you have always been of the same opinion with Us and the other dllies, that a good union betwixt the allies, not only during the present war, but also after the peace shall be concluded, is, and always will be, the most solid, and even the only method to preserve the liberty and independency of all together, and of every one in particular, against the great power ofFranqe.

We expect also, that after having given such great and signal proofs of your wisdom, of your firmness, and of your zeal, for the support of the common cause, your majesty will not now take such resolutions as may be prejudicial to us and tjbe other allies; but that, in order to obtain an honourable, sure, and general peace, you will pursue the same methods, and keep to the same maxims, which you formerly beta, and which Almighty God hath blessed in so remarkable a manner by victories and great events, which will render the glory of your majesty’s reign immortal.

We again renew to your majesty the assurances of ouy high and perfect esteem for your person and friendship, as also of our intentions and sincere desires to entertain with your majesty the same good correspondence, harmony, and union, as before, apd to cultivate the same betwixt the two nations, as far as it shall lie in our power; and we pray your majesty to preserve likewise for us and our republic your former affection. We refer for the rest to what the Sieur Van Borsele, our envoy extraordinary, has further to say to your majesty on this subject. And pray the Almighty, Ac. ' *

FontainbUau, Aug. 91, S. 1713.

My Lord; I left Calais on Monday, according to what 1 writ to your lordship from that place, and proceeded on my journey to Paris, where I arrived about six o’clock, Wednesday in the evening. On the road 1 took all possl-. ble precautions to conceal my name, and to

avoid all sort of ceremony, by stopping ty re* fresh myself as' little as possible* and when t did stop, by chusing.to do it out of the great towns. My card was, howeder, in a great measure fruitless; and they did their utmost in the places through which I passed, to shew their* respects to the queen; sp that I Arrived at least as much fatigued with compliment as tired with toy journey.

Soon after I &ot out of my chaise, a gentleman came to me from J^adame de Croissy, brought her coach, invited me to supper, and told m<S that M. de Torcy was coming post from Contain bleau to meet me. In effect 1 had hot been long at the Hotel de Croissi before he arrived.

There was no resisting his importunities, as well as his mother’s, and 1, was forced to continue with them during my stay at Paris. In these two days T lost no time, but pursued her majesty’s instructions with all the application I am master of; -and I humbly hope that I have been so happy as to answer the purposes for which she sent uie hither.

We began with the interests of the duke of Savoy; from whence the principal obstacle to the conclusion of the suspension of arms by seaj and land atpse, add after some contestation have adjusted them in this manner.

The right of this prince and of bis' family ta the crown of Spain and the Indies, after Philip and his descendants, is to be substituted in the same acts, and at the same time, as the several renunciations and settlements are made, declared, and confirmed, which are necessary to accomplish the article for preventing the union of the two monarchies.

M. de Torcy endeavoured to leave this point more.loose, and either to defer securing the succession of the House of Savoy, or at least not to establish it in r^same acts as are to past on the other occasion; bttf as I judged (his to be the safest and most authentic manner, I insisted, and he yielded.

On the cession of 'Sicily he would have adhered to the terms of his last dispatch, and urged the absurdity of giving this kingdom away till they were sure of making peace with Savoy, It was not difficult to shew that he had already departed from this argument, and that there could be no reasonable objection to Philip’s making a cession ofSicily to the duke of Savoy at the same time as he consented to secure to him the succession of Spain and the Indies: that if a peace did not follow, every thing which had been done would of course be void; and that if it did follow, the consideration for which this island was yielded would be obtained. This point being over, there was little dispute about the lime when his royal highness shall be put into the actual possesion of this kingdom; we have settled it to be on the ratification of a general peace, or of a peace between the-queen, France, Spain, and Savoy.

The count de Maffei may not perhaps be satisfied with this agreement; and I remember, in his memorial he desired his master might, be at liberty at any time to take possession; but

•fcxciii] APPENDIX.~iV^o/i«^W7w/or Pcatc: 1715. frxciV

the duke of Savoy ought to look upon it us a very good bargain, and to be contented to have the advantages, which are to accrue to him, jput into his hands, when those which her majesty stipulates for herself are put into bers.

I wish I could have prevailed on the head of the barrier ar far as 1 did on the other two; but it was impossible, at least it was so for me. jM. de Torcy represented, that Exilles, Fe-nestrelles, and the valley of Pragelas, besides the restitution of all which France is in possession of, was the utmost which the king would. ever consent, or had ever consented, to give: That when the ministers of Savoy made, in Holland, the same ulterior demands which they now make, the pensionary laughed at them, and even? at that time* did not push him to comply with them: that, under pretence of security, his royal highness really sought an aggrandisement at the expence of France, and out of the ancient domain of this crown: that, though a king of France was a more powerful prince than a duke of Savoy; yet that the latter, backed by a confederacy, which is the only case wherein he will attempt any thing, is « dreadful enemy to the former: that they have here a minority to expect, and therefore ought to be the more careful not to leave the frontiers of their kingdom exposed: In short, that Sicily was an ample recompence to his royal highness for all the services he had done the queen; and that if her majesty was easy, be was sure the duke of Savoy would submit: be concluded, by repeating very earnestly, that the king never would grant him a larger barrier, and that his majesty insisted to. put this negative now, since he was resolved to do it at last, least the duke should, by continuing in hopes, spin out the treaty, and delay concluding his peace; for which reason he likewise insisted that the queen shoutd concur in this negative.

It is needless to lengthen my dispatch by telling your lordship what answers I made to these representations; I replied in the best manner I was able, and ended, as I am instructed, by letting this minister know, that the queen would consent to nothing which should foreclose his royal highness from eb-• taining what, for ought she knew, might be necessary; that this point therefore must not be now looked upon as determined, but must be left open for the ministers of Savoy to debate; that I did not understand her majesty’s intentions to be to enlarge the duke of Savoy’s dominions out of those of France; but that I was sure she would not sign a peace unless this prince’s security was really and effectually provided for, which France having promised in general terms to all the allies, could not refuse in any particular to the duke of Savoy.

The next head to which we proceeded, was that of, the renunciations and settlements, necessary to prevent the union of the two crowns; and, in treating of this, I cannot say that I met with any difficulty r I gave no hopes that any expedient would be accepted to sign the peace before, this article wasintirely ac-Vol* VII.

1 complisfaed, though M. de Torcy proposed that the peace should not be delayed for it, but the ratifications should. He has since consulted M. Bergbevk, and they are of opinion, that a month’s, or, at farthest, six weeks time, will suffice to pass all the forms; so that I am desired to recommend the dispatch of my lord Lexington, or whoever else the queen shall think fit to send, into Spain; and I crave leave to say, that it would be extremely out of course, if in .France and Spain they should be ready to finish this important article, and we should, on our parts, not be ready to witness the execution of it; especially when we push the concluding of the*peace, and refuse to sign until all these forms are perfected.

The draught of Philip’s act of renunciation, and the minutes taken by M. de Torcy and me, both which I transmit to your lordship, will, I suppose, be a sufficient groundwork of instructions to those whom her majesty shall chuse to send hither end to Madrid.

The last point, that on which we had the warmest debates, was concerning the elector of Bavaria. As soon' as I arrived at Paris, I heard that he was come to Cbaillot, in the neighbourhood, and M. de Torcy either was, or affected to be, under some uneasiness at the reproaches which this prince would, he said, with reason give them, unless they provided better for him than the queen had hitherto seemed inclined to allow.

He turned this matter several ways, and made variety of propositions, which it was plain enough were’not extempore, though he appeared desirous I should look upon them as sudden thoughts which occurred to him in treating. At last he rested on this, That the queen should engage to procure for the elector the duchy and electora te ef Bavaria, exclusive of the upper pala-nate, and the rank in the electoral college, which I had from the first peremptorily rejected; and' that she should further promise to maintain him in the possession of the duchies and towns of Luxemburg and Namur, and in the possession of Charlerov and Nieupert, until such an equivalent for these countries and places was given him, as he should be satisfied with. This proposition I positively refused to assent to, and told M. de Torcy- very plainly, that leaving these towns and places in the elector’s possession till he had such an equivalent as he should be’satisfied with, was really giving them abso~ iutely to him; which I knew her majesty neither could or would -admit. Further, that her majesty would enter into no engagements to procure any thing for the elector, or even to use her offices in his behalf; that the towns and places which this prince is in possession of would very probably be an. inducement to the allies to give him something in lieu of them: that her majesty woold not oppose his having Sardinia; which equivalent had been proposed first from hence. This I let him know was the sum of all he was to expect from the queen; and your lordships will find the minutes drawn accordingly.

€XCt1 APPENDIX. — relating to the '

Having on precedent occasions as well as this, perceived, that M. de Torcy affected to hint every expression in such a manner as to engage the queen jointly with the king his master, I thought proper, very explicitly, and in the strongest terms I could use, to say that the queen would enter readily into the common guaranty for supporting that Settlement of Europe, which should by the peace be made; but that she would on no account whatsoever be concerned'in any stipulation to procure this settlement; that it would be advantage sufficient for France, if the conduct of her majesty’s allies made it just and necessary for her to withdraw herself out of the war* before them; and that afterwards her good offices should be employed as became the common friend of all parties.

I take occasion frequently to repeat this to the French ministers; and I believe they will look upon it as the rule which her majesty has laid down, and which they shall not be able to prevail on her to depart from.

On Saturday in the evening I came to Fon-tainbleau, where an apartment was provided for me, and my reception was particularly civil. Qn Sunday at nine in the morning I had audience of the king, to whom I presented her majesty’s letter.

He received me in a very gracious manner; be talked a considerable time with me, and the substance of whdt he said, as near as 1 can remember, for his speech was extremely quick, was, That he hud ever had the highest esteem for the queen:that she had proceeded in such a manner as to turn that esteem into the sheerest friendship: that he hoped she was satisfied^ had done every thing on his. part which might facilitate the peace: That he was pleased to find we were so near concluding; that there were some who used all endeavours to obstruct it, but that, God be praised, they would not be long able to do so: That God would hinder them from giving the law which they pretended to:That the success of his arms should make no alteration in him:And that he pould make good all he bad offered.

FontainffleaUf Aug. 22, N. S. 1712.

After T’ad had my audience yesterday of the king, l.eturned with M. de Torcy, to view the minutes we had taken, and die draught for the convention of the suspension of arms, which we signed in die evening: Your lordship - will observe, that it is dated on Friday last, at which time the first brouillion was prepared; and I thought that every day which the commencement of it was pot backward, was some degree of advantage to us: the term is of four months, which M. de Torcy desired, as more likely to have its effect on the Dutch than a shorter term, which might liave suffered them to entertain hopes still of breaking our measures, and bringing the queen into action again. I did not much weigh the force of this argument, though I think it has somewhat deter- mined me te agree to four mouths, according to

the latitude left in my instructions, was first what I be remembered to have been the sense of several merchants Whom I spoke with before I left London, who all seemed desirous of the longest term, and thought that two months would not encourage many - people to venture upon some voyage*. Secondly, that a term of two months would as effectually cut off all prospect of acting by land this campaign; as a term of four; and that therefore the sea service would be chiefly affected by this suspension, where we have more to apprehend tbaa to hope. '

Monsieur de Torcy had inserted m the draught these words, les Mers qui entoureut les Isles Britan niques, ’ and cited the treaty of Breda as a precedent. I shewed him, that before that treaty, the expression had always run ‘ Maribus Britannicis, ’ particularly in the treaty with Cromwell; and that the error committed in that of Bred a, had been rectified in that of Ryswick. He insisted more than I expected on retaining his word, and entered a little into the dispute of dominion. This made me the

more tenacious, and your lordship will find these words, ‘ les Mers qui entourent les isles/ razed out; so that it stands now as it ought to do.

The suspension being now signed, I shall, pursuant to my instructions, .dispatch her ma--jesty’s orders, to sir John Jennings, to Mr. Chet-wynd, and to the officer who commands the queen’s troops in Catalonia.

M. de Torcy is likewise very earnest that the duke of Argyll be dispatched, judging hispre- sence necessary upon this new turn of affairs for the common interest; I cannot help thinking it is so, particularly for her majesty’s service.

Just now the duke of Orleans told me; that the king had this morning, at his levee, declared that the suspension of arms was signed; and M. de Torcy informs me, that they intend tomorrow to publish it at Paris. I will therefore lose no time in dispatching this courier, as soon as I receive, (which I expect every moment) the copy of the act ofrenunciation which has been prepared in Spain, and wherein the Spaniards seem to have neglected no expression which could add to the strength, and no form which could add to the validity of it; Philip’s consent to the cancelling the entry of 1700, mentioned in the convention for the suspension of arms in Flanders, and the inserting the substitution of the duke of Savoy, will be the subjects of additional clauses. I shall be extremely concerned if the queen does not receive this account before the news comes-any other way; but I lose no time, and Lhope the messenger will lose none.

The fifty passes in blank I have not yet received, but hope to have them time enough te accompany this dispatch.; -

The chevalier has fixed his departure on the first of next month, N. S. They propose that he shall retire to Bar; and they intend to write to the duke ofLeirain, to ask; of the emperor

I must not conclude this letter without asking your lordship’s pardon for a piece of false news, which I sent you from Calais, concerning an action at Pont a Rache; the story was told us with so many circumstances, that I made no doubt of the truth of it, especially when the mayor of the place quoted a letter which he said he-received from his son-in-law, who was at that time in the army.*,

As 1 intend to leave this place on Wednesday at furthest, it will be proper ty lose no time in dispatching a letter of credence to Mr. Prior, to whom your lordship will likewise please as soon as possible, to send the queen’s ratification.

This letter is already swolen to so great a bulk, that I believe your lordship is very willing I should refer to another opportunity such - further accounts as I have to give of my proceedings. I am, My Lord, your lordships, roost humble and obedient servant,

Since I closed my letter, Monsieur de Torcy sent me, word, a courier is arrived from Turin in his way to England; and desired to know if I would have him go on, which I did* not think proper to binder* I suppose this courier is -dispatched to the count de Maffei, upon the impatience which the duke of Savoy is under, upon not hearing from hencev according to what he was made to expect by his minister’s letters, which went by way of Holland some time ago.

. I am only to observe to your lordship, that the sooner you take an opportunity of speaking to the count de Maffei, the better.

Besides the papers mentioned in my letter, I send your lordship a form of publication of the ouspension, and a memoir which I received from M. de Torcy concerning some articles of trade. General Stanhope is just arrived here ju his way to Britain* Boling broke.

I do not remind you of the ties of blood which unite him as well to you as to me, nor of many other reasons which ought to render you sensible of his condition:It is sufficient for me that you are sensible of the concern that I have in what regards him; and I am persuaded that this will be the principal motive that will press you to act in his favour; I expect with impatience the return of Mr. Prior, whose conduct is very agreeable to me: And as he will assure you of what ray sentiments are, I will only add thathe cannot sufficiently express the perfect esteem and sincere friendship that I have for you.

Monsieur, my brother;

I have received with a very sincere pleasure the agreeable letter which Mr. Prior brought me from you. As your consummate wisdom hath taken the resolution that is most proper to fix the terms of the peace, you will be persuaded, that I -will cot, on mypart, lose a moment to hasten the conclusion of it. I assure you that the great facility that you are . willing to lend towards it, out of a regard to me, shall be made no other use of, than to he employed, without any delay, to re-establish the public tranquillity, according to the wishes of us both. By the orders that I give to my ministers at Utrecht, it will appear, that I do all that is in my power at the present conjuncture, in favour of a prince whose interest is supported by your generosity.

1 don’t at all doubt but he himself is fully convinced of it, and that all the wdrld agrees in it. I again repeat, Monsieur my brother, that the consideration of your friendship will be a very prevailing motive to engage me a new in his interest, and in the interest of his family, as occasion shall offer, for the future: As to the rest, I send back Mr. Prior to Versailles, who in continuing to conduct himself in the manner that shall be intirely agreeable to you, does no more than execute to a tittle the orders which I have given him ; and amongst all the proofs of his duty and.zeal for my service, I expect, in a very particular manner, that he should take all possible occasions to repeat to you the esteem and-perfect - regard that I have for you, and my earnest desire to live with you iu a sincere and perpetual friendship.

Dectafation to be made by the French P tentiaties.

(Extract; )

- The plenipotentiaries of the king at Utrecht shall declare to those of Great Britain) that his majesty consents to treat of the peace according to the plan proposed by her Britannic majesty in her last speech to her parliament; but they shall at the same time also declare, that the Dutch having refused to conform to the sentiments of this princess, rejected the suspension of Arms, and given occasion to the. Change of affairs, it is but justice that his majesty receive restitution of the expences he has been obliged to be at during the course of this, campaign:His majesty therefore agrees that the plan sent by him to London, last April, be exactly followed. And this is the precise declaration which his majesty’s plenipotentiaries •hall make to those of the queen of Great Britain.

But upon the forementioned grounds the king orders his plenipotentiaries not to sign the pdace, but upon condition that the city of Tour-nay be restored to liim, besides the restitution of the other places he demands, and which he has reason to believe her Britannic majesty intended to comprehend in her speech.

The king will continue to use all imaginable care, in pressing, as soon as possible, the conclusion of the peace between his majesty and the king of Spain on one side, and the queen of Great Britain, king of Portugal, and the duke of Savoy on the other, leaving to the ' Dutch the liberty, of doing what they shall judge most proper.

Mr. Methuen’s Memorial to the King of Spain. April22, N.1715.

The underwritten minister of the king of Great Britain most humbly represents to his catholic majesty, that he fiods himself obliged, by the commands and instruction* be has -received from the king his master, to demand in his majesty’s name,

That all the privileges and concessions the kings of Spain have ever granted to the British merchants, by their royal Scheduias or ordinances, and' by the articles of the treaty of peace and friendship made at Madrid intshe year 1667, -may be fiuIJy confirmed, as they are in effect by the eighth article of the treaty of peace and friendship, concluded at Utrecht, the 13th day'of July, N. S.-1713, between the crowns of Great Britain and Spain. That the trade of the British merchants in alt the ports of the kingdom of Spain may be established, and remain upon the same foot as it stood in the time of king Charles the Second, and before the declaration of the last war. *

That the British merchants may not for the present, or future, be obliged to. pay any other duties and customs on the goods they import into the several ports of this kingdom, or export out of them, than those which they paid, on the same goods, in the reign of king Charles the Second.

ect£ APPENDIX.-*!*igoeiotkm for Peace:17IS. [ccii

That the nmemethod as- vmSnd practised, ; im die manner of collecting those .customs, may be now, end far the time fee come, observed; and that in (be payment of them, the British merchants may be allowed the 'same gratvra, favours, abatements, end deductions, a* were allowed them at any time daring the reign ef king Charles the Second, by the hr* men of the customs, or the administrators of the king. And his Britannic majesty hopes that his catholic majesty will make no difficulty in granting to hie subject* the same liberties, indulgences, and favours, in their trade to his dominions, as they formerly enjoyed; since his majesty desires nothing herein that can be any detriment or prejudice to Ins catholic majesty, or the interest of his own subjects; but, on the contrary, what has been allowed by the kings his predecessors, and practised as well by their administrators of the customs, as by the farmers of them.

That all the articles contained in the treaty of navigation and commerce, concluded at Utrecht, between the crowns of Great Britain and Spain, on the 9th day of December, N. S. 1713, so far as they are detrimental and derogatory to the privileges and concessions of the royal schedulas and ordinances, granted, at any time, by the kings of Spain to the British merchants, and to the articles of the treaty at Madrid, in the year 1667, may be declared null and void.

And particularly the three separate articles called the three explanatory articles, contained only in the ratification of the said treaty of navigation and commerce, concluded at Utrecht, as having been inserted and obtained in a very extraordinary manner, without having been first settled or signed by any of the ministers of both crowns, 'that were impowered to conclude the said treaty.

That his catholic majesty will be pleased to graut to the British merchants, that they may have the privilege of having a judge conservator in all the parts of Spain where the judges contervatorshave been formerly allowed, till the death of king Charles the Second: And that the said judges conservators may be vested with the same power and authority, for the defence and protection of his Britannic majesty’s subjects, and their exemptions in trade, as was formerly granted them, and constantly enjoyed, by virtue of the royal Schedulas or ordinances, dated the 19th day of March, the 26th of June, and 9th of November, in the year 1645,

: and confirmed by the ninth article of the treaty made at Madrid in the year 1667.

As to the first point contained in this memorial, which is, that the trade of the British merchants in Spain, may be established1 upon the same foot as it was in the time of king Charles the Second; the minister of the king of Great Britain hopes it will appear to- his catholic majesty to be founded on justice and reason, when his majesty will be pleased to -consider,

That the French nation, which drives a con-

. » siderable trade to thin kingdom, has always traded and does now continue to do so, wholly upon the same foot; there beiag no other treaties of commerce between the crowns of Spain and France subsisting, but those which have been made either before the time of king Charles the Second or daring the reign of that prince.

As also in the 17th article of the treaty of peace and commerce concluded at Utrecht, the 26th of June, 1714, between his eatholic majesty and the States General, it is stipulated in fevour of the States, that their subjects shall enjoy the same privileges, franchises, and exemptions in their navigation and commerce, without any exception, or reserve, as they did enjoy before the late war.

From whence it follows, that the king of Great Britain’s subjects having, by all the treaties between both crowns, an undoubted right to all the privileges, liberties, and immunities in trade which have been, or may be granted to any other nation whatsoever, they cannot be with justice, refused the same privileges and exemptions, in their trade, as are granted or continued to other nations, and were enjoyed by them before the late war, during the reign of king Charles the second. As: to the lust point, which relates to the judges conservators, besides the just right the subjects of the king of Great Britain have to that privilege, the same which is now demanded for them being already granted in express words to those of the States General, by the 29th article of the above mentioned treaty, between his catholic majesty and the Statesy the minister of the king of Great Britain hopes his majesty will make no difficulty in granting it also to the subjects of the king his master.

And-it is certain, that if these judges corner-vatois had been established, as they should have been burned iately after the cessation of arms and conclusion of the peace, it would have hindered most of the disputes which have happened between the king’s officers, and the subjects of the king of Great Britain, since those differences might nave ended in the places where they begun; which would have prevented the many oppressions the king of Ghent Britain’s subjects have laboured under, the great number of law suits now depending before the council of war at Madrid, and the intire ruin of several poor people and their families for ever, some of which have iieen here near two years soliciting for justice, without having been yet able to obtain any decision of their causes. •' Given at Madrid, the 23d day of April, N.

Whereas nothing can be of more importance

But since there is reason to believe, that the attempts on Cadiz will be more practicable in yoor return, yon are therefore, without loss of time, to proceed to the coast of Catalonia, leaving the execution of the attempt on Cadiz ton more proper season, when they less expeei you, and when you may probably have some assistance from the army in Portugal, and the garrison of Gibraltar. And, being arrived on the coast of Catalonia, we require and Command you to do the best you can, to induce the Catalans to co-operate with you for the reduction of Spain to the obedience of king Charles HI. And you are to encourage those people wh'oni we think well-affected to the House of Austria, to shake off the yoke of France:and, to ani- / mate then to prosecute their liberty with more vigour, you are hereby empowered to assure' them, that they shall not want our support; and you may promise them, in our name, that we will secure them a confirmation of their' rights and liberties, from the king of Spain, that they may be settled, on a lasting foundation, to them and their posterities; and you must use your best endeavours, that the declarations to be issued by his catholic majesty be suitable and agreeing with those published by our order.

But in case you find no suitable returns from the Catalans and Spaniards to our kind offers, and that they are not to be prevailed on, by fair means, to espouse the interests of the House of Austria, then you are to take proper measures for aunoying the towns on the coast of Spain, and reduce them by force: In this, and all other services, governing yourselves, as before directed, by council of war.

Sir; The queen having understood by the duke of Shrewsbury’s last fetters, that the catholic king did not intend that the amnesty be granted to the Catalans, should extend to the preservation of their privileges; I cannot express to you sir, bow much surprise her majesty shewed upon it: for to speak plainly to you, it was never thought his catholic majesty designed to take away the lives of the inhabitants of a whole province, so there, was no occasion to provide for it by a treaty. The sole thing then intended in stipulating a general amnesty, could be no other, than that this province should be permitted to eejoy] the same privileges, and be upon the same foot in every respect, as it was at the death of the late king of i Spain, Charles the 2d. The Queen, sir, has ordered me to represent this to your excellency in a most earnest manner, as a matter in which her majesty’s honour is very much concerned, that she looks upon it as an article already stipulated in all its forms, and which she thinks herself obliged by motives of conscience not to depart from.

Monsieur Orry spoke to me from the king last week, saying that his mtyesty desired, that the queen would be pleased to lend him six or more ships to block up Barcelona; and this rooming the princess pressed ine extremely upon the same subject; I answered to both, that I could say nothing to it, but that I was afraid it would meet with this difficulty, that her majesty would be very unwilling to lend her ships to exterminate a people, that had token up arms in a great measure at the instigation of her ministers; and that she would think she had done enough to gratify the king of Spain, in not insisting upon the preserving for them their ancient liberties, without helping to destroy them; and that if his majesty could havt been prevailed upon to have been less rigid upon that head, all this had been avoided, and the Catalans perhaps in a great tranquillity, and as obedient subjects as fury in Spain this day.

Gentlemen;

. I wish I could have seen, before my departure for England, the desires of the queen ray mistress accomplished; but it is so long since I have received her majesty’s orders to return, that I cannot defer the same any longer, and I set out this day from Madrid, in o(der to go' and embark at Lisbon, where one of our men of war stays for me, so that the best I thought I could- do- for you, xwas to employ the last moments of my-stay, in supplicating anew the king yqurmaster, to receive your obedience in the words of the treaty, of Utrecht, and to pardon your refusal of the amnesty which w.ao offered you by his catholic majesty. I charge the consul at Aiicant to convey tips letter to you, under any pretext whatsoever, and that it may be delivered safe to you, that it may induce you, for your own good, to take the resolution of having recourse to the king’s clemency, There are advices here which assure, us, that you have applied to the queen myrois-tress, for using her good-offices with the catholic king, for obtaining this fovour in your behalf; relying upon those advices, I venture writing to you upon this subject, having always been desirous to contribute te every thing most favourable drat might be demanded for you at this juncture, which is such, that I must repeat to you, I canuot give you a better advice, than that of accepting the amnesty in the manner it was offered you, since God has not permitted that any thing more could be obtained in favour.

Sir; I send you the letter for the gentlemen #f Barcelona, as we have concerted it, and approved by his majesty, a letter for the count of Lecberaine, and another for our consul at Alicant; it is necessary that the count of Le-cheraine should be made privy to this matter, for otherwise it would be very difficult to persuade . any one to undertake such an affair, Which leads directly to the gallows. You must either secure the person by a passport, that will undertake it, or give him a good reward; Otherwise you will find nobody to do it.

, ' I desire you, sir, to be perfectly persuaded, that where-ever I am you have a faithful servant sensible of all the obligations you have ^aid upon me, I desire you to lay me at the feet of the king and of the queen, to whose service I shall be devoted all mylife, I go away deeply affected with all the favours and civilities their majesties have shown me on all occasions. I shall have an eternal ratitude for all the marks of goodness of ma-am the princess, and will not fail to acquaint the queen with the zeal she has always shewed tor her majesty's service. ’

His lordship orders me to send you likewise the letter, mentioned therein, to the gentlemen of the deputation of Barcelona, which his excellency has been persuaded to write, at the repeated desire of this court.

That about a fortnight ago this was proposed to his excellency by the French ambassador, who at the same time read a paragraph out of, a letter from M. de Torcy, wherein he says, that the queen had desired his master to join with her, in order to induce this court to accommodate that affair; to Which his lordship answered, that he < could say nothing to it, since he had received no orders to that purpose.

That the same was afterwards proposed by the princess, and in a very pressing manner, the morning before his lordship left this court, and at the same time told him, that the king desired he would come to him that eyeqing; which his lordship accordingly did, when his majesty was pleased to tell him, that he had received a letter from his grandfather to the same purpose with what the French ambassador had before told him, and that therefore he desired

bis lordship would write such a letter; upon which his excellency told his majesty much the same as what you will find marked in this Iqtter to Mr. Orry; however he thought he could not refuse to comply with his majesty's repeated desire upon this occasion, especially -since theVe is nothing contained in the said letter, but what has been agreed upon at Utrecht, and his lordship was the more inclined thereto for this reason, that if they had a mind to accommodate, the queen would have the mediation; and if they had not, that then this court would see, that her majesty would be always ready to serve them, and how necessary she might be to themupon all occasions, which his lordship hoped, would very much hasten the conclusion of the peace. .

when you judge it necessary, you are to make reprisals upon such as refuse to do justice to our subjects; We being determined to do all that in us lies towards restoring the free and peaceable navigation of those seas, and securing the quiet and unmolested commerce of all fair and lawful traders.

You will have herewith put into your hands an authentic copy attested by Theopilus Blyke, late commissary of our stores at Barcelona, of the receipt given there, for such nart of the •aid stores as were taken forcibly from him in the month of August last, notwithstanding his procuring an article ol his instructions, by which he was forbid to deliver out any stores unless by direction from our captain general, or commander in chief of our forces; you will have likewise a copy of a letter from the deputation at Barcelona to our high treasurer of Great Britain, and an estimate of the value of the aforesaid stores attested by the said Theophilus Blyke. Upon these foundations, when ^you come before the said city of Barcelona, you will in our name demand the immediate payment of the value of the said stores according to the estimate aforementioned, or a sufficient security for the payment thereof in some reasonable time; and you will further represent to the deputation of Barcelona on this occasion, that they have great reason to think themselves very tenderly used, if y/e only demand the value of the stores which were taken in so unjustifiable a manner, to be paid us; whereas we might with so much equity, and on so good grounds likewise insist upon a Cull reparation for the affront offered to us, in violently seizing our stores, and confining the person of our officer.

We have also directed that a copy of the convention made at Utrecht, for the evacuation of Catalonia, and for preserving the neutrality ofjtaly, should be put into your hands; we easily foresee that many complaints will be made, and that many disputes will arise con* earning the performance or infraction of that convention, whereof we made ourselves contractor and guarantee in so very particular a manner. Whereof we think fit jo require and command you to endeavour upon all occasions to redress any tiling that may be done contrary to it, and to enforce a strict observance of it in all its parts.

Upon your repairing to Barcelona, you are likewise to give notice of your arrival to our right, &c. Robert lord Bingley, whom we have ' appointed to be our ambassador extraordinary at the court of Spain, and to send him an account of your proceedings; and in this and all other matters relating to our service, you will take care to correspond with our said ambassador:particularly in order to the putting an end to the disorders and confusions which now reign in those parts.

And. whereas he will be instructed to use his utmost endeavours to obtain for the people of Catalonia (notwithstanding their refusal upon the evacuation of that country by the troops of his imperial majesty, to submit to our good brother the catholic king) all the security and advantages that are possible; you shall therefore, upon receiving from our said ambassador an account of what he has been able to obtain from the court of Madrid in their behalf, endeavour by the strongest representations you can make, to induce the government of that principality to accept of the terms so obtained; and no longer to continue a war, the event of which must, sooner or later, he fatal to them.

And whereas by our instruction^ afore-men-mentioned, we did likewise direct you to demand satisfaction from the inhabitants of the island of Majorca and others, for the piratical depredations which have been and may be exercised on any of our subjects trading in those seas: Our further will and pleasure is, tbatyou should in the first place take all proper methods of persuasion to induce the inhabitant^ of the said island to submit to the term^ which our ambassador at Madrid aforesaid shall inform you to he offered to them; and in case they do persist -in their refusal to comply with such terms, then you are tQ employ the squadron under your command in countenancing and assisting all attempts which may be made for the reducing of the said island of Majorca to a due obedeince, that so the same having been yielded up by his imperial majesty, may become subject to some government or other, and no longer remain in the state it is at present, a harbour for pirates and robbers.

You are to take the first opportunity you have, when you are on the spot, and joining with the Spaniards in their undertakings, to settle with the officers of the court of Madrid, the -several species of provision, and other necessaries which our Island of Minorca 6hall have occasion to draw for their subsistence

You shall likewise take the best care you can that it may be understood, that our subjects of the Island of Minorca may have free leave to fetch what quantity of wood they shall want from the island of Ivica:and if you find the Spaniards to take umbrage at this practice, or to make a difficulty of allowing this liberty, then you are to insist, in consideration of the friendship between us, and the catholic king, and of the obligations which he has to us, that 6ome agreements or convention be made for settling that matter on the best terms that can be obtained, and as shall be reasonable.

You received, Sir, sometime since, orders from the queen of Great Britain, to use heir good offices with the king in favour of the Catalans, who have rebelled against the king of Spain, and of the inhabitants of Barcelona. You acquainted me, that her Britannic majesty was sure they would submit to the king their master if that prince would grant them u general amnesty, the restitution and enjoyment of all their estates, and, in short, the same conditions which he bad caused to be offered them, and which they did not accept, without mentioning their ancient privileges any more.

The answer which the king just how receives from the Catholic king upon this article, is, that he is still willing to grant the same conditions to the rebellious Catalans, notwithstanding they rendered themselves unworthy of his favours, by slighting them, and although he is now in a condition to reduce them by force; he desires the king to impart his answer to the queen of Great Britain, my lord Lexington having had no orders to speak about this affair.

My lord, whereas it has been usual that the grant of exemption from the said duties has been made to the admiral and commander in chief of her majesty’s ships when on these coasts:

I desire your excellency may be pleased td move that the said grant be made to myself, if you think convenient; but as this is but* trifle *

ITranslation of the Letter from the City of

Barcelona, to Sir James Wishartf July 23, 1714, N.S.

Sir, Your excellency’s letter of the 8tfi instant, O..S. which was delivered to us by captain Thomas Gordon and captain John Pulley, commanders of the Moor and Launceston, contains your complaints against us, that our privateers have detained the English ships, having plundered and abused them, and deprived them of the freedom of trade; for which reason your excellency demands satisfaction for damages j and, to inform us of this fact, captain Gordon has communicated to us, a memorial which we auswered immediately; and we have the honour to acquaint your excellency, that only one of those vessels, mentioned in the-said memorial, laden with salt, was brought into this harbour by our privateers; and that after having taken out her lading, and intirely paid tire captain for the same, lie w ould sail out of the port with all his sails, and a strong ' wind, the pilot having no regard to the shaUow-ness of the water, nor to the intimation that was given him of the danger to which he exposed himself, as> he experienced it; for he run aground at the entrance of the harbour, and got off with much difficulty, by the speedy assistance that was given him. Nevertheless we do not think we ought to pay for the damages occasioned by the ill conduct of tire pilot.

As to the other ships mentioned in captain Gordon’s memorial, as we have not had the least knowledge of it, we suppose there must be some mistake; it may be also that at Majorca or Ivica they may know something of it. However, we can give an account of some other ships that came into this port to sell the provisions they bad on board:they were well used,

and sold freely their goods at a higher price than they could have got any where else, having paid thPra with our best sort of money to their intire satisfaction, having thus supplied us with what we wanted, being besieged: in which condition, according to the law of nations, we are persuaded we have not acted against justice or reason, as your excellency will see by the inclosed copies of letters, which we writ to thU governor of Port Mahon, and commodore George Camock, and by the answer of tire former to this city; whereby we doubt not but your excellency will be convinced of the justice of our proceedings, and be made sensible, that the news spread in Europe that we lived like pirates, is a mere invention of our enemies, to ' render us odious to mankind, and hinder them from trading with us, thereby to deprive us of all necessaries for our subsistence, in order to reduce us the sooner. And to convince your excellency how much we value a good correspondence and unioir with the English nation, an order was published- this day in this city, forbidding our privateers, upon pain of death, not to take, detain, or abuse any English ship, under any pretence whatsoever, although they should even carry provisions to the enemy. We hope your excellency will be so just as to approve our conduct, which is conformable to the rights of people that are besieged; assuring you, that when we shall know of any of our ships, either with commission, or without, that shall have caused the least damage to any English ship, we will not only punish them rigorously, but shall likewise be ready to make good all damages, as we told captain Gordon morn at large; for we desire always to continue ja that good correspondence, which we have maintained hitherto with yoilr noble and generous nation, and to shew our most profound respect towards the queen of Great Britain; as also to obey your excellency’s orders, which we earnestly desire you will please to honour us with, being with great truth and respect, &c.

Your excellency very well knows, that the engagement Catalonia entered inrt», to receive Charles the third for their king, was founded ou the protection of the high allies, but most particularly of England; without which we were not capable of coming into so great an undertaking. It was carried on seven years, during which time we hpve always seen most valiant ‘English troops, ' that have distinguished themselves not only in the sieges of places, but also in their defence; particularly in that of Can-dona, which as it was the last action, so it is fresher in our memory. In all this time Cata. Ionia endeavoured to serve the English nation to the uttermost of their powet, by contributing troops, and considerable sums of money without interest. And though we bad pleased ourselves with the thoughts of the happiness to be always

subjects of Charles the third, seeing him so powerfully supported; yet by the ordinary change to which human affairs are liable, we now see the troops of the duke of Anjou, assisted by the French, masters of all the principality except Barcelona and Cardona; committing through the whole, the most execrable hostilities, burnings* and plunderings, without sparing the effusion ofjnnocent blood, and without distinction of age or sex. The enemy have for a year oppressed this town by sea and land, and we continually suffer the calamities of so long a blockade; during which time above

14,000 bombs have been thrown into the town, which have ruined' the greatest part of the houses. They are now endeavouring to attack us iu form, and we fear that in 24 hours the town will be battered iii breach.

We cannot express to your excellency with how much .grief we see the danger the inhabitants are exposed to, of becoming the victims of that cruelty with which they are threatened by the enemy; and having no other comfort left, .but, to fly to the queen of Great Britain, we implore her protection by the inclosed letter to don Pablo Ignacio Daltnases, our envoy at London. In the mean time, till an answer can Come, we beseech your excellency from our souls to mediate with the French troops, who oppress us, for a suspension of arms:since at the congress of tladen, where endeavours are Using to conclude a general peace, this affair may still be determined. We doubt not hut your excellency’s mediation will be powerful enough to procure us this relief, ytmr excellency being commander in the Mediterranean, and your squadron being superior to that of the enemy. We see no other remedy but this, in nature, to our misfortunes; and therefore we hope your excellency will not refuse us:in this, our relief consists. -And if Catalonia has merited any thing by its services, and by its conjunction with the English nation, this is now the time to receive the fruits of it, being worthy, by the means of your excellency, of this benefit: for which all the principality, and this town, will ever be obliged to the whole nation, and particularly to your excellency:desiring nothing more than to compensate, by our services, this favour, which we hope from your excellency’s goodness. It is worthy of your excellency to comfort the afflicted, and not to deny us this favour in our great necessity. And your excellency may bt assured of our perpetual gratitude:desiring your excellency to honour us with your orders and that God grant you a long life, &c.

Sir; I hid answered your letter of the 21st of October, N. S. when that of the 2d of November was delivered to me. I shall no more repeat to you the assurances of a perfect sincerity; since words become useless, when there are opportunities of shewing it by deeds.

Mr. Gaultier, who will have the honour to give you this letter, will at the same time give you a description of the present situation of the affairs of peace.

It is easy for those who find their interest m the war, (I make use of your own expressions) to raise and keep up misunderstandings:This is what ill-meaning people endeavour at, as well with us as elsewhere. I am nevertheless in no great pain, since it does but depend on the most Christian king to render their efforts of no use: The explications you promise me will dissipate all these clouds; and you may believe we will moke use thereof with great reserve, when I assure you, that if the king would but offer, as he has heretofore done, a plan of specific preliminaries, the queen would never communicate it to her allies.

I shall conclude in assuring you, that provided the Sieur Gaultier returns with these marks of confidence, of which I, make no doubt, you will see our parliament which is going to meet, as much inclinable to peace as ever it was to war. I am, &c. H. St. John.

Mr. Prior’s Account of his Examination, before the Committee of Secrecy appointed to inquire into the Negociations, relating to the Treaty of Utrecht *

IN outward appearance, they were all very civil; set me a chair equal to the table where they sat, and next to secretary Stanhope, who had the books and papers of the secretary's pffice before him. Mr. Walpole the chairman said little more than mere compliment. Mr. Lechmere, with great industry hid, from me, and often himself looked into papers in folio, Unbound, and covered with a blue sheet. I did not then know what they were, but during the examination, I perceived it was the report then printed, and in some few days after published. He began with an affected eloquence, that as I had served in a very high employment, and with very great applause, the committee relied upon my candour and probity: That as

* See the Proceedings of the Home of Commons, June 17, it 16.

what they asked me was for the King's service, so what I answered would be for my own honour. After this some of them began with several vague questions: What I knew of the negotiation ? How long I had been acquainted with the abb6 Gaultier ? If the propositions came first from France, or if we sent them f And desired me to give them an account of whatever I could of that whole matter; which, it seems, they thought I was so ready to do, that some of them took their peas and paper, as if I were to begin a sermon, and they to tako short notes.

• I said, that as I had always acted abroad by the authority of the crown of England, and had, in obedience to the king's commands, given up all the memorials and papers which, related to that pait of the peace in which I bad a share, I was desirous to answer the honours -

fcxxiii] APPENDIX. —

ble committee (before whom I understood such papers were) ip every thing that might help to explain them: That my books were already before them; and, as I had already written to Mr. secretary Stanhope, those books must even speak for themselves. The committee, seemed to acquiesce in my answer. Lord.Coningsby whispered the chairman, and said, no, we will begin with the money.

The committee then desired to know what money I drew from the treasury in 1711, when I went into France. I answered, 200/.; and, as I remembered, that was the sum. I had either credit from Mr. Clifford, on his correspondent, or from M. Cantilion:I could not well remember which, it being now four years since. Had you these bills, some of them said, from my lord treasurer. ? I replied no. They asked me, was it by his order ? I said, I hoped there was no occasion for a reply to that question. I presumed it would be found, as other money expended on the like occasion, by direction of the sovereign. I found they were not pleased with this answer. Walpole said, Will you think a little of the method in which this examination is to proceed ? And Mr. Prior will be pleased in the mean time to retire a little.

' When I was called in again, the same question was asked me, and the same answer returned. I added, that I well hoped those sums, and several others of much greater importance, were paid:That otherwise, for want of knowledge in the crown laws, I should find myself a beggar; and from an hotel at Paris, might spend the rest of my days in the Counter: And here I addressed myself to Mr. Stanhope, as to what I had writ to him concerning my debts. He said, that nothing of all this concerned me. Prior. I must apply to you upon another head. I must own myself unexperienced in the method of parliament; I have no papers by me; I have no counsel, for want of memory or judgment I may err; and though gen* Clemen, I am accused of nothing, 1 know not but that, I may accuse myself through inadvertency or mistake.

Here Mr. Stanhope rose up ', and told the committee, that lie had the king’s particular direction, that whatever I said to them, or they to the House of Commons, should not be of any prejudice to myself. 1 took a sheet of paper, which lay before me, and wrote this down, a# I did what they had already said to jpes Here, after they had whispered, and some $ven separated themselves from the table to confer in a corner of the room, the chairman told me I might withdraw; which I did, leaving tfye notes I had taken upon the table.

When I was called in again, I found their. civility much abated, and the battery quite changed. The most confused questions were put to me, upon several heeds backward and forward, by Lecbmere and Boscawert, and Coningsby, (the two first of whom I think understood not one word of what they were saying). Coningsby at length prevailed. Mr.

Prior’s Examination (ccxxif

Prior, you were sent put that you might have time to recollect more particularly upon whotp you had credit, when my lord of Oxford sent you into France. Prior. I have great respect to the earl of Oxford; but. he never sent me into France. And turning to Mr. Secretary Stanhope, who had the books of the office of 1711 in his hand, I said, That as I had the honour to be sent into'France by the queen’s especial appointment and immediate direction, I presumed the copy of my powers were to be found in the books before him. He tnrning to it, Mr. Prior, is this the copy of your instructions ? Prior. I believe it is i but to give the committee no further trouble on this head, I am ready either now, or any other time, to produce the original, as I think it may tend to my service. Being asked of whom I received money in France ? I answered, of M. Can* tillon. Boscazven. Was he not a papist ? .

Else, sir, he could not have been a banker at Paris, which he had been for several years'before I knew him. In one word he was the common banker to whom the English addressed selves, apd I think Clifford of Amsterdam was his correspondent. Stanhope and Walpole, I found frowuing and nodding at each other, mid extremely ashamed at this vile stuff.

Being sent out, and called in again, I found the thunder broke out. Walpole referred it to Stanhope to speak. Stanhope. The committee are not satisfied with your behaviour to them. I have already told you, that the lords above, and the committee here, have taken notice that they find a*constant correspondence on your side to the lord treasurer, but no answers from him; whereat all your letters from lord Bolingbroke are entire, and commonly in their right order. Some of those indeed are missing. The. whole committee echoed the same thing. Prior. I was told some hours since, by thi9 honourable committee, that I should be asked nothing that might prejudice myself. I am a good deal confused; I have no counsel; and with great respect, I look upon this to be a downright accusation of myself, as if I should have held any correspondence I was unwilling to declare. I must refer myself to you in this point; Mr . Stanhope. The letters that we receive’ when abroad, from the secretaries of state, we keep, copying oar answers to them, both which justify our acting according to our orders sent us; and I presume it will be found that my letters, which you have in your own keeping, answer' those written to me by the secretaries of state under whose departments I acted; which letters you have likewise. You have also the letters I have wrote to the lord treasurer in my books, at least those of them that related to the public affairs, and consequently were worth keeping. I did not nor could Texpect a constant correspondence from him. What I wrotp was for his information; what use his lordship made of that information, I bad reason to presume was for the queen’s service; and the answers and directions tp roe were to come by the secretary of state. Committee. It is very

strange that npt above two or three letters should appear from my lord, treasurer, Did hp not write more to you ? He writ to pje

Several times, and I obeyed his commands intimated to me therein. Those commands performed, the letters were of no use, and I no more kept them than I did letters received from pther noblemen, the duke of Buckingham, the lord Halifax, lord Harcourt, then lord chancellor, &c. They related no otherwise to the negotiation, than in commending me, assuring me that he represented my services to the queen in a right light, and wishing a speedy pnd to the negociation, that I might come home tp him.

I was sent out again, and recalled; was psked how many letters I might in all have received from my lord treasurer, and what was the substance of any of them. Prior. 4* to the number, 1 cannot particularly tell: I received a letter from him sometimes of five, sometimes of ten or twelve lines, ordering me to pay sums of money to persons who had the queen’s pension, and were then in France, pr recommending some of his particular friends to my acquaintance, or, which I thought much better, telling me he had ordered the payment of roy bills; but I might very safely affirm, that I had no letter that cpuld possibly concern the committee, or any body else, I have one letter that as lord treasurer he writ to me, which related to the payment of the dowry of king James’s queen Mary; a thing publicly transacted, and known here, in England: But as no progress was made iu that affair during my stay in France, and that it did not belong to the negociation of the peace, I had not indeed given up that letter, but, as I thought, 1 could find it, or the copy of it, if it should have bpen thought of any use. In the mean time, I thought proper, in cape any thing had been done in that matter, to keep that letter for toy own justification; as indeed it would have been my order. Boseatoftp. Sir, you say you do not know how many letters you had; might you have ten ? Prior, I believe I might. Bos-cawen. Might you have fourteen ? Prior, I believe I might. Botcmven, Might you have 16 ? jPrior. Indeed, Mr. Boscaweh, I have told you that I cannot answer you to any indefinite number. It was still urged with great vehemence, that I kept a constant correspondence with my lord treasurer. Prior. I am.very far from denying it; but he did not keep a constant correspondence with me. It was my duty tb write to hiifi> and he was to make what use be pleased of my letters. I complained sometimes of the .(Objections I met with at the court of France in the execution of my orders; and wa$ very glad when, by the letters from the secretary of state, I found my difficulty made easier; But, gentlemen, since we are upon this subject, throughout the whole course of my letters to ]py lord treasurer, and even in those I wrote to the duke of Shrewsbury, after his grace’s return both in England and Ireland, I still complained that my lord treasurer did list writ* to

Vox.. VII/

me, And here indeed, being Very much teized and vexed, lord Cortingsby raving apd threatening that these letters must be produced; I said, If there be such letters in the world, that contain the secrets of the negociation written by my lord treasurer, it might be very well presumed his lordship kept copies of them, and he must produce them: For said I, by the eternal God I know of no such letters; and you know, my lord, that your countryman is no very exact correspondent. This 1 said, having known that lord Coningsby had troubled great men, if not my lord treasurer -particularly, with letters, who had never taken care to answer him. I grant this was very foolishly said:for one should never provoke a hedgehog. Coningsby breaking out into a great passion, This is imposing upon thp committee J Prior. Imposing, roy lord, is a very hard word. He -lifted up his voice in anger, and was going on: But Stanhope, yet louder than he, swore, that he could produce every individual scrip of paper that had been written to him by any man dive, or that he had written to any man during his teing a minister abroad. Prior. Mr. Stanhope, I am sorry I cannot do the like: if it be so, you are the most careful minister that ever yet waa sent abroad. They proceeded in asking me to give an account of what, they said, I must needs know of the meeting of the lords at my house with Mesnager and Gaultier. I had already heard, that they bad consulted their friends of the law upon that point, and had determined to fix upon that meeting, wherein the preliminaries were signed, as an accusation of treason. How justly I leave to the judgment of all disinterested and honest men; since first, in the nature of the thing, it is impossible for any two. nations in war to come ever to an accommodation, or begin any plan, upon which a future peace may be founded, without some overture and intervention of this kind. All treaties, from that of Vervens down to this x day, have been thus mediated. Calieres was in Holland, and discoursed and conferred privately with M. Dyckvelt, on the part of the States, above two years before be took a public character, and signed the treaty of Rys-wick. M. de Torcy was publicly in Holland, 1709, conferred with the pensioner, and the deputies of the Stales; and our own plenipotentiaries, the duke of Marlborough and lord Townshend, reported from those deputies to her majesty, what the French minister either proposed or granted. Mesnager had as, full powers as France could give, had owned the queen’s authority, and seen her person; and had, by her majesty’s directions, several times conferred with the lords of a committee of Cabinet:all the world seeing the man, and knowing the fact: so that any meeting after this could not be secret, dangerous, or treasonable. Mr. St. John’s letter on . the 25th of September, 1711, to her majesty, informs her immediately of this meeting, and her majesty approves of what is there done, by her ‘especial warrant for signing the preli-

minaries, containing the demands made- by her order*.

It may be observed that Mr. St. John writes to the queen thus,

aThe committee of council met this morn-tl ing at the Cockpit, and directed the earl of “ Dartmouth and myself to confer with M. <* Mesnager:we saw him accordingly this even-a ing, at Mr. Prior's house, where my lord “ treasurer and lord chamberlain were likewise present." The treason therefore, if there were any, was committed in the morning by the committee of council, and at the Cockpit, and not at Mr. Priori house in the evening. It may properly here be added, the queen had signed a warrant the 17th of September, 1711,

. to the lord keeper, for full powersf; in which my lord Harcourt then lord chancellor, the earl of Oxford lord treasurer, the duke of Buckingham president of.the council, the bishop of Bristol lord privy seal, the duke of Shrewsbury lord chamberlain, the earl Poulett lord steward of the houshold, and the earl of Dartmouth and Mr. St. John secretaries of state, and Matthew Prior, esq. were nominated and empowered to meet with the Sieur Mesnager, provided with sufficient authority to settle an eventual or conditional convention between her majesty and the most Christian king; and that this warrant was not made use of, for reasons given, being very natural, because they were offers only on the French side, and did not oblige her majesty to any thing: so they were only signed Mesnager, and Dartmouth and St. John are only witnesses that these articles are to be looked upon as conditions which his most Christian majesty agrees to grant, and which are afterwards to be reduced into form, and explained to the common satisfaction of Great Britain and France. Though this procedure will, without doubt, hereafter appear consonant to common sense, conducive , to the safety and good of Great Britain, and justifiable by the universal custom and law of .nations; ‘ Nunc non erat his locus.' I said, M. Mesnager had often been at my house; that the secretary of state had seen him there; that I had eat and drank, and been abroad with him several 'times. They took great hold of this. Boscawen expressed himself with great joy, This is more than we knew before ! And from thence they ran wildly back, When I knew Gaultier? Where I had been with Mesnager ? I answered to this in as general tf nns as I'could. The chairman perceived that they would lose their point in this multiplicity of questions, and, checking their speed, restrained it to this one demand. Chairman. What lords were present at yonr house at the meeting .when the preliminary articles were talked of or signed ? I answered, the two secretaries of state; for it is certain they were so, .their names appearing in the instrument. Chairman.

* Appendix toihe preceding. Report p. cv. + Ibid, p. c*.

Was my lord Oxford there ? Prior. I cannot recollect it: ~ One of the lords were absent; whether the duke of Shrewsbury, or the earl of Oxford, I cannot tell. In all sincerity and ho* nour this is truth. They grew extremely an* gered upon it, and sent me out to recollect if both these lords were not present.

I came ih, and assured them again, that as well as I could remember a transaction, of which I took no notes, and .which was now about three yean past, and of which I was so far from expecting to be called to any account) that I thought it was an honour to me, 1 could not determine which of the two were absent. I said, again, that this was fact, that I do not re*-member it: I have only an idea that one of them was absent. The answer indeed had this effect, that it was the same thing as if they were both absent, since they could not determine which of them was present. But upon this meeting no less accusation than an article of high treason was to be fohnded. Was any thing moire difficult ever pnt upon a man, than to endeavour to extort an evidence from me) in order to bring those to the scaffold who were my friends and patrons, under whose orders formerly, and with whom jointly now, I had the honour to act, by the queen's directions, and in a matter not only innocent, but laudable I Or could any thing be more absurd, or more inhuman, than to propose to me a question by the answering of which I might (according t<T them) prove myself a traitor f Since, as I had heard, every man who is a partner, is a prini cipal in treason:and notwithstanding their solemn promise, that nothing which I could say should hurt myself, I had no* reason to trust them; for they violated that prerrmd about five hours after (a? I shall say anon.) However, I owned I was there present. Whe^ ther this was wisely done or no, I leave to my friends to determine. ’

From my being taken up by order of the House of Commons, this examination was just a week. They now, after I had beeri turned out, and returned again, interrogated me: If since my being taken into custody, I had not seen my lord of Oxford, or any of his relations ? I said, I had seen my lord Oxford the last Sunday at Mr^Tbomas Harley's house; and was going on to explain that Mr. Thomas Eiarley and I, who were taken up at the same time, (living within three doors of each other) commonly dined together at one or the other of our houses, our respective messengers guarding us. That on Sunday going to dine with Mr. Harley, I saW my lord Oxford at the stairhead, going out: that I asked him if he dined with us: He told me, he was to dine in better company j Thht this was all that passed between us; thp messenger at the bottom of the stairs heard every word! said to him. As 1 was telling this, they answered it was sufficient, I bud seen my lord Oxford; and his near relftt* tions; which was the question asked.

I here was ordered to retire, and when I was catted in again, the chairman, from amongst

many books and papers which he had before him, (and the secretary of state had on the •other side as many; and I perceived many of them were my own) the clmirman, I say abruptly enough drew out one half-sheet of. the large demy paper, written very foul, andrazed in several places, which indeed, when he gave into my band, I hardly knew what it was, so far as to give any reasonable account of it, it being without date or title, and, as 1 say, very imperfect as to the very words and stile. He asked me drily, and without any other previous word, if I knew that hand? Prior. There are two hands in it, one is very like the hand I write when first 1 make any hrouillon. One or two of the Committee. Sir, what do you mean by a hrouillon ? Prior. When I write any thing at •first only for my own memory, as to what I would draw up after in a more perfect manner. I perused this piece of paper, and upon a little reflection, directing myself to Mr. Stanhope, said, *I believe this paper contained some notes upon a letter t received from his predecessor my lord Bolingbroke. He was apprised of this before, for he readily turned to the letter whigh was registered in the office-book. I - added, that I thought there were some notes I bad taken in the French language, to enable me to speak more particularly to Monsieur de Torcy of the matters mentioned in the said secretary’s letter. As that letter was written four years before, and 1 was not in possession of my own letters, the secretary himself and the committee cpuld best inform themselves of the substance thereof. There was written, 4 My lord, Tr. ne doute point .que la Cour de France n’y trouve de remede.’ Now whatever lord that might mean, they had already printed it my lord trea-. surer; and in so. doing had given that' sentence the wrongest construction imaginable, As proving that my lord treasurer would give up Tournay to France; whereas the whole hint was meant to renew to the ministers at that court, that Tournay was to be given to the allies: and it was to keep the court of France from endeavouring to hope the contrary. As what was. in this broullion was sometimes abridgment, and sometimes a verbal translation of my lord Bulingbroke’s letter, which Mr. Stanhope still held close, and as I read the French into English, I asked him if the same tense was in the letter. He did not deny it. Coningsby grew extremely angry, and on a sudden broke out into some expressions which neither he should have uttered* nor will.I repeat; and so I was ordered to withdraw agaiu; which was in the next room, where not only a messenger of the House of Commons, but a door-keeper of the secretary’s office, waited all day, and were still ready to receive me.

Being called in again, I was interrogated without method or connection, as any member of the committee pleased, and indeed with con-. fusion and disorder enough among themselves; for they sometimes stopped each other’s ques-

• Vide the preceding Report, p, Ixvi.

tion, and proposed new ones of their own. At ’last, it came to this. Chairm, Mr. Prior, wie cannot doubt but that you arc apprised of tte whole affair of Tournay. Did my lord ever write about Tournay ? Prio. I cannot readily answer, as not understanding the force of the question; I believe my lord treasurer may have writ to me concerning Tournay at the beginning of the negociation: I am sure he has spoke to me about Tournay'; I may be mistaken as to the time; but I think in 1711 the French insisted upon their having Tournay;

But f very well remember* that the queen’s instructions to her ambassadors for the general peace, were positive that the Dutch should have it; I understood the negotiation to continue always upon that foot. I added, that as the affair of the Barrier was transacted at Utrecht,

I had nothing in my instructions relating to that whole matter, otherwise than as it might relate in general to the peace. What I have of the whole negotiation is before you. Here Walpole and Stanhope grew mightily perplexed; one in a sullen, and the other in an unbounded passion, Coningsby rayed out-right. I may justly protest that I could not conceive the cause of this disorder; for I did not'know that they had already founded, their high treason upon the articles of Tournay, against my lord treasurer; nor can I since comprehend why they did. To shew the justice, as well as the good judgment of these men, it must certainly appear not only extravagant, but ridiculous to all that think righter than the committee, that is, to all men living, that an article of High Treason should be founded against an English minister upon Tournay, which was not given up to the French, and no mention ever made of (Lisle, which actually was given up. This by the way. It may be further observed, that at that time not one third part of the committee themselves did know upon what point the *. accusations either against the earl of Oxford, or any man else, were to be grounded; several of them having since told me themselves, that they never either drew up or read the report; but that those things came to them, as they merrily expressed it> ready cut and dried.

But to return to ray journal; this various and incoherent manner of examination having now lasted above nine hours, two of my mastert (by the way) sir Richard Onslow, and general Erie, had left the committee almost at the beginning of the day; for to give them their due, they asked me very few questions while there, and by going away seemed ashamed of the proceeding; And now Walpole himself grew weary of it, and was going, but hindered, and as it were kept in the chair by Mr. Stanhope, who said openly, they could not go on without the chairman. I was ordered to withdraw, and during about half an hoar’s recess into the next room, or rather passage, as the door was by chance opened, I heard them extremely warm and loud with one another. Whilst I was in this little room, in which the messenger, under whose custody I was, and a door-keeper of the

) APPENDIX. — ite-.

. secretary'# office, as I have already said, were waiting, ConiDgsby came out by a back-way, asBoscaweti did by the fore door. In this room was a trunk, and in it several papers and memorials, to which the committee had recourse during the examination. The trank was open, and I could not but perceive by the indorsements that many of the papers were my own* Coningsby whispered the officers to take care that I. should notcome nigh the trunk, and really looked on me more like a fury than a man; though certainly I had all the right imaginable to see every paper that related to me in my examination, which was pretended to be made on no Other foot, than that the king should be informed of what I had done for his service ill the negotiation of the peace; and if the committee themselves had had really a mind to be apprised of the truth as to fact, the hindering a man whom they intended should becoihe all evidence from seeing his own papers, was but an ill method towards his giving them a clearer intelligence.

I was now called in lor the last time, and I found that they had Collected several heads of what they thought propet I should set my hand to. I read them, and made some objections thereunto, but to ho purpose. I said, that to many questions I had not, nor could, answer in the positive mariner that vfraS there set down:That tys to divers facts, I could not take things upon my memory; That as to others, I had indeed said I believed, I thought, I heard, or understood, they were so:That the omission of these words made me say positively, and as an evidence, what I should not be able, to maintain; having only answered them as my memory served me, and as' much as I knew of the heads upon which I had been interrogated: knowing that they themselves had blamed my answers, for being Very imperfect; and I had more than once told them, I was sorry I could not answer them more fully. I objected against these Words; He confesses, that since his confinement, he has conversed with the earl of Oxford, arid his nearest relations. I did not, I sdid, confess. Confession supposes a crime: I was told, I was accused of none: I said I had seeu the earl of Oxford at Mr. Thomas Harley’s; and as I was going to tell the thing again, Jesds! said Coningsby, how perjured is this man ? Prior, My lord, have a care of — — . Coningsby, No, Sir, it is you that must

have a care. Seeing now the face of the committee against trie; knowing and presuming that if fiver the duke of Shrewsbury, the earl of Cfcfordj or lord Balingbroke himself* should be

' Prior’s Examination* . [ccxxxtf

brought to trial, I must be sore before the lords have an opportunity of explaining what I had said, and declaring what usage I had found from the committee, I signed the paper.

I cannot here omit a ridiculous instance of my Middlesex justice’s skill in the law: He was just going to set his nime on the left baud of the paper, wherft I was to have set mine: and if he had not been timely cautioned by the chain-man, it would have been1 the deposition of ‘ Hugh Boscawen, jurat coram me, Matthew Prior/

1 When I hud thus signed the paper, the chair* man told me, that the committee were not fit all satisfied with my behaviour, uor could give such an account of it to the House that might merit their favour in my behalf: That at present they thought fit to lay me undera stricter confinement than that of ray own house. Here Boscawen played the moralist, and Coningsby the Christian; hut both very aukwardiy. Boscawen said, that he had often heard Mr. Stepney, (who was a wise mao, and our old friend) repeat this proverb, Near is my shirt bat nearer my skin; and told me, if I had remembered that saying, and acted according to it, it would have been better for ine. Arid Coningsby said, he had kriown me a long time, and was heartily sorry for my condition; but all this proceeded from my ow^i fault. Now this kind commiseration did not last above a minute; for the messenger, to whose house thfiy intended to confine me, being called, Co- . ningsby asked him, if his house was secured by bolts and bars. The messenger, who is by birth a gentleman, and a Very good-natured ' man, Was astonished at the question f and answered, that be never had any in his custody but parliament prisoners, (as ne expressed It,) and there were neither bolts dor Dars in his house. At which Coningsby Very angrily said, Sir, you must Secure this prisoner; it is for the safety of the nation, if he escapes, you Shall answer for it. And now I met with another hardship, which indeed I could net have expected, as I had all day taken notes *of the heads of their examination, and my answers, and particularly that Mt Stanhope had, by his majesty’s Ordfir, informed the committee, that froni whatever 1 should say in this examination nothing should or ought to redound to my prejudice:Not indeed could it be imagined I Should ariswer upofi any other foot; for with-nut the king’s consent, I doubt, if I ooght si . all to We aoswetW to the Committee.

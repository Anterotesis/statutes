[2d May 1823.]

WHEREAS for the Space of Twelve Hours out of every Twenty-four there is no direct Communication between the Mainland and Hayling Island in the County of Southampton, (except by Boats) owing to the Passage commonly known by the Name of The Wadeway, which runs in a very uneven, unequal, and circuitous Manner from Langstone in the Parish of Havant in the County of Southampton, across Langstone Harbour, to Hayling Island aforesaid, being overflowed by the Sea: And whereas, from the Violence of the Winds and Sea, the said Passage, called The Wadeway, is frequently covered by the Tide the whole Twenty-four Hours together, and Boats are often totally prevented from crossing the said Harbour, by reason whereof any Communication between the Mainland and Hayling Island becomes impracticable, and great Inconvenience, Difficulty, and Loss are thereby occasioned, and the Lives of His Majesty’s Subjects are very much endangered: And whereas from the necessary Intercourse between Hayling Island, Havant, Warblington, Emsworth, Horndean, Cosham, Bedhampton, Farlington, Fare-[Local.~\ 3 M ham,

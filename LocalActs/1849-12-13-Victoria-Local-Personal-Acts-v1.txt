Cap. xviii.

An Act for altering the Mode of assessing the Drainage Rates authorized by the Act for draining and improving Marshland Smeeth and Marsh-land Fen in the Country of Marshland in the County of Norfolk, and to provide for the Repair of Roads within the Limits of the said Act.

[24th May 1849.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the Thirty-sixth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, intituled An Act for draining and improving, and for inclosing, dividing, and allotting, certain Tracts of Common and Waste Lands called Marshland Smeeth and Marshland Fen, lying within the Country of Marshland in the County of Norfo\k, and for stinting and regulating the stocking, feeding, and depasturing of the said Smeeth and Fen until the Inclosure, Division, and Allotment thereof, whereby Powers were conferred upon the Commissioners constituted by the said Act for draining, dividing, and allotting the Tracts of Common and Waste Lands called Marshland Smeeth and Marshland Fen, and also (upon the Application of the Proprietors thereof, and which Application has been made,) to include certain other Lands [Loca/.] Y y called

called Well Moor, Broad Fen, and Short Fen, in the said Drainage, and Powers were conferred upon the Commissioners for Drainage constituted by the said Act to tax and charge the Owners and Occupiers of the said Common and Waste Lands with such equal and proportionate Rates and Assessments upon each and every Allotment to be made by virtue of the said Act as they should judge necessary for the Purposes of such Drainage, and to tax and charge the Owners and Occupiers of the said Lands called Well Moor, Broad Fen, and Short Fen with such proportionate Rates and Taxes for the Purposes aforesaid as should be equal to the Rates and Taxes to be raised and payable out of the said Common or Waste Lands : And whereas it was by the said Act enacted, that the Commissioners for Inclosure therein mentioned should set out such public Carriage Roads and such private Roads and Ways as should be necessary and convenient, and that all such private Roads and Ways should be repaired at the Expense of the Persons entitled to the said Tracts of Common and Waste Lands in such Manner as the said Commissioners for Inclosure should direct: And whereas the said Commissioners for Inclosure, pursuant to the Directions of the said recited Act, set out, allotted, and awarded several private Roads, but no public Roads, over the said Common and Waste Lands, and declared in what Parishes the said private Roads should lie, and directed that the said Roads should at all Times thereafter be repaired at the Expense of the Persons who for the Time being should be entitled to the Parcels of Land therein-after awarded within the several Parishes wherein the said Roads were therein declared to be, so that the Roads within each Parish should be repaired at the Expense of the Persons entitled to Lands in such Parish, and that the Expense of repairing the said Roads should be borne by the Persons entitled to the said respective Lands in the same Proportions as the Occupiers of the said Lands should respectively contribute to the Rates for the Relief of the Poor, or other Rates or Assessments within the said Parishes: And whereas by the Mode of Assessment prescribed by the said recited Act for the Purposes of Drainage the Lands in the said Marshland Smeeth are unfairly assessed, and made to contribute an undue Proportion of the Expenses of the several Works for the Drainage and Preservation of the Lands in the said District, in comparison with the Lands in the said Marshland Fen, and it is considered just and reasonable that all the Lands in the said Smeeth and Fen (together with the Lands in Well Moor, Broad Fen, and Short Fen,) should be rated equally by the Acre throughout the whole of the said District for all Purposes of Drainage : And whereas it is expedient that certain of the said Roads so set out as aforesaid as private Roads should be declared to be and should be made public Roads, and that the said Marshland Smeeth and Marshland Fen, together with the said Broad Fen and Short Fen, should be formed into a separate District for the Repair of the said Roads, and that further Provision should be made for the Repair of the said Roads, and that the Owners and Occupiers of the Lands within the Limits of the said District should in respect of such Lands be exempted from all Highway and othei Rates, and from all other Liability, pecuniary or otherwise, for repairing any Road or Highway not being within the Limits ol the said District: And whereas the Objects aforesaid cannot be effected without the Authority of Parliament: May it therefore please

Your

An Act for authorizing the Bradford Waterworks Company to raise a further Sum of Money.

[24th May 1849.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the Fifth Year of the

Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act for better 5 & 6 Vict. supplying with Water the Town and Neighbourhood of c.6. Bradford in the West Riding of the County of York, whereby a Company was incorporated called “ The Bradford Waterworks Company And whereas under the Provisions of the said Act the said Company were authorized to raise by the Issue of Shares the Sum of Forty-four thousand Pounds, and to borrow the further Sum of Fourteen thousand five hundred Pounds upon Mortgage for the Purposes of the said Act, and which said Sums have been raised and applied accordingly : And whereas in exercise of the Powers contained in the said Act the Bradford Waterworks Company have constructed extensive Works for the Purposes in the said Act mentioned, but the Necessities of the Town and Neighbourhood of Bradford require that such Works should be extended and enlarged, and the Capital which the said Company is authorized to raise under the Powers of the said Act is greatly insufficient to meet the additional Outlay necessary for such Purpose, and it is expedient that the said Capital should be increased, but the same cannot be done without the Authority of Parliament: May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it [Locn/.] 3 /S' enacted

254

Powers of recited Act to extend to this Act, except as hereby-altered.

Powers to raise additional Capital by the Creation of new Shares.

New Shares to be considered same as original Shares.

If old Shares at a Premium new Shares to be offered to original Shareholders.

12° VICTORIA, Cup.xx.

enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That all the Provisions, Matters, and Things contained in the said recited Act, and now remaining in force, (except such as are by this Act repealed, altered, or otherwise provided for,) shall extend to this Act, and to the Objects, Purposes, and Things hereby authorized or required to be effected and done, in the same Manner as if such Provisions, Matters, and Things were repeated and re-enacted in this Act with express Reference to the aforesaid Objects, Purposes, and Things.

II. And be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Bradford Waterworks Company from Time to Time, by an Order of any Meeting of the Proprietors thereof specially convened for the Purpose, to raise, by creating and disposing of new Shares, in addition to any Sums which they are already authorized to raise under and by virtue of the said recited Act, any further Sum not exceeding Twenty-seven thousand five hundred Pounds, and which said Sum is to be applicable to the Objects and Purposes of the said recited Act and this Act.

III. And be it enacted, That the Capital so to be raised by the Creation of new Shares shall be considered as Part of the General Capital of the said Company, and such new Capital and new Shares shall be subject to the same Provisions in all respects, whether with reference to the Payment of Calls, or the Forfeiture of Shares on Nonpayment of Calls, or otherwise, as if such Capital had been Part of the original Capital, except as to the Number and Amount of the Shares into which such new Capital shall be divided, which shall be subject to the Provisions herein-after contained, and except as to the Times of making Calls in respect of such new Shares, and the Amount of such Calls, which respectively it shall be lawful for the Directors of the said Company from Time to Time to fix as they shall think fit.

IV. And be it enacted, That if at the Time of any Augmentation of Capital taking place by the Creation of new Shares the then existing Shares of the Capital Stock of the Company be at a Premium, or of greater actual Value than the nominal Value thereof, then the Sum so to be raised shall, subject to the Provisions herein-after contained, be divided into Shares or Stock of such Amount as will conveniently allow the said Sum to be apportioned among the then Shareholders in proportion to the existing Shares held by them respectively, or as near thereto as may be; and an Offer of such new Shares or Stock shall be made by Letter under the Hand of the Clerk of the Company given or sent by Post to each Shareholder, or left at his usual or last Place of Abode; and such new Shares shall vest in and belong to the Shareholders who shall accept the same, and pay the Value thereof to the Company at the Times or Time and by the Instalments which shall be fixed by the Directors of the said Company; and if any Shareholder fail for One Month after such Offer of new Shares to accept the same, and pay the Instalments called for in respect thereof, it shall be lawful for the Directors of the said Company to dispose of such Shares to any Party willing to become the Purchaser thereof for such Sum as

the

25 5

12° VICTORIA, Cap.xx.

the Company can obtain for the same; and every such Offer made by Letter sent by the Post shall be considered as made on the Day when such Letter shall be committed to the Post Office.

V. And whereas the existing Capital of the Company consists of original Shares of the nominal Value of Twenty Pounds each, and new Quarter Shares of the nominal Value of Five Pounds each, and some of the Proprietors of the last-mentioned Shares hold an uneven Number thereof, and the Division of the Capital by this Act authorized to be raised into Shares of such a nominal Value as would admit of an equal Distribution of such Shares amongst all the Proprietors of the Company would be attended with considerable Inconvenience and Expense : Be it enacted, That so much of the Capital Stock by this Act authorized to be created as the Proprietors of less than Four new Quarter Shares, or of any Number of new Quarter Shares over and above Four, or (as the Case may be) over and above any Number equally divisible by Four, would, but for this Provision, be entitled to receive in respect thereof, shall be disposed of by the Directors of the said Company in such Manner as shall appear to them best adapted for securing to the said Proprietors their relative Proportion of the Value of such Stock.

VI. And be it enacted, That if at any Time of such Augmentation of Capital taking place the existing Shares of the Capital Stock of the Company be not at a Premium, then such new Shares may be of such Amount, and may be issued in such Manner, and may be sold and disposed of at such Price, and payable at such Times and by such Instalments, as the Directors of the said Company shall think fit.

VII. And be it enacted. That any Number of Shares in the Capital of the Company for the Time being, the aggregate nominal Amount whereof shall be equal to the nominal Amount of an original Share in the Capital of the said Company of the nominal Value of Twenty Pounds, shall entitle the Holder of such Shares to the same Powers, Rights, Privileges, and Qualifications in respect thereof as the Holder of an original Share in the said Capital is entitled to in respect of such original Share, and so in proportion for all the Shares held by the same Proprietor.

VIII. And be it enacted, That after the whole of the Capital by this Act authorized to be raised shall have been subscribed, and One Half of the Capital of the Company for the Time being shall have been paid up, it shall be lawful for the Company to borrow on Mortgage such Sums of Money as shall from Time to Time be authorized to be borrowed by Order of a General Meeting of the Company specially convened for the Purpose, not exceeding in the whole the Sum of Two thousand five hundred Pounds, and to secure the Payment of the Sums so to be borrowed, with Interest, by Mortgage of the Undertaking of the said Company.

IX. Provided always, and be it enacted. That all Mortgages granted under the Provisions of the said recited Act, and which may be in force at the Time of the passing of this Act, shall have Priority over all Mortgages to be granted under the Powers of this Act.

Disposition of Shares in respect of old 5l. Shares.

If existing Shares not at a Premium new ones to be issued as the Company may think fit.

New Shares to confer same Privileges as original Shares in the Proportion to their nominal Value.

of such Loss or Damage to be ascertained in the Manner by the said Act provided: And whereas by the said third-recited Act the said Commissioners were authorized to borrow, on the Credit of the Rates and Duties leviable at the said Port and Harbour, before Compensation should be made or provided to the Proprietors of Salmon Fishings in manner directed by the said second-recited Act, any Sum or Sums of Money not exceeding Six thousand Pounds Sterling in the whole, over and above the foresaid Sum of Fifteen thousand Pounds, and in addition to the Debt authorized to be contracted under the Authority of the said first-recited Act: And whereas the said Commissioners have, in pursuance of the Powers committed to them by the several Acts before recited, executed and carried on a Variety of Operations and Works for the Improvement of the Navigation of the said River and the Enlargement and Improvement of the Port and Harbour of Perth, and have also made Compensation to the Proprietors, Lessees, and Occupiers of Salmon Fishings, so far as demanded, for the Loss and Damage sustained by them during the Continuance of the said Operations for improving the Navigation of the River, and also during Five Years or Fishing Seasons immediately succeeding the Termination of such Operations, as directed by the said recited Acts, but no sufficient Provision has been made by the said recited Acts for the Payment of the Compensation to be made to the said Proprietors : And whereas the Tables of Rates and Duties authorized by the said second-recited Act have in some Instances been found defective, unequal in their Operation, and disproportioned to the relative Values of the Goods and other Commodities upon which the same are leviable, as well as to the Lengths of the Voyages made by Vessels charged with Tonnage Dues:

And whereas it would be attended with Advantage to the Public if the Time allowed for the Completion of certain of the Works and Operations authorized by the said recited Acts were extended beyond the Period therein specified, and if the said Commissioners were authorized to borrow and take up at Interest such additional Sum or Sums of Money as may be found necessary for satisfying and paying the Amount of Compensation due to the Proprietors of Salmon Fishings as aforesaid, and if the said Rates and Duties were regulated, adjusted, and equalized as is herein-after provided; but as these Purposes cannot be effected without the Authority of Parliament,

May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the Time allowed by the said recited Time for Acts for the Execution of the Works and Operations thereby au- executing thorized to be made, done, and performed shall, excepting as to certain of so much thereof as relates to the Operations for deepening and im- autholiml proving the Navigation of the said River 'lay, be extended, and the by former same is hereby extended, to the Period of Twenty Years from and Acts ex-after the passing of this Act; provided always, that such Works and tcnded-Operations shall only be executed in or upon Lands, Grounds, or Heritages which shall be at the Time the Property of the Community of the City ol Perth or of the said Commissioners.

4° GEORGII IV. Cap. cxiii.

prejudicial to Trade, and dangerous to Navigation, to the Diminution of His Majesty's Revenue, and the impoverishing of the Inhabitants of Minehead, and other Places and Counties adjacent; and that the Charges of making such new Head and Works, and of repairing and maintaining the same, would be too great to be borne by the said TregonwellLuttrell and his Heirs; it was enacted, that after the Twenty-fourth Day of June One thousand seven hundred and one, for the Term of Twenty-one Years, and to the End of the then next Sessions of Parliament, there should be paid (besides the ancient and customary Duties and Acknowledgments then already due and accustomed to be paid to the said Tregonwell Luttrell and his Ancestors) for the Wool, Woollen and Bay Yarn, and other Goods which during the said Term should be imported or exported into or out of the said Harbour of Minehead, the Sums of Money and Duties therein mentioned; and that for every Ship, Hoy, Bark, or Vessel, which, during the Term aforesaid, should by Stress of Weather be driven into the said Harbour, or should otherwise come into the same for Security (the said Harbour not being their discharging Port), there should be paid, by the Master or other Person taking charge of the said Ship or other Vessel, the Duties of Tonnage and Keelage therein mentioned : And it was further enacted, that the several Persons therein named should be Trustees for making the said new Head and other Works in and about the said Harbour, and maintaining and repairing the same, from Time to Time during the said Term; and for ordering and directing the Collection, Receipt, and Disposition of the said Sums of Money and Duties which during the said Term should be due and payable: And it was further enacted, that all Sums of Money that should be raised and received by the Duties aforesaid, and recovered for any the Forfeitures in that Act appointed (other than so much thereof as should be laid out and allowed for collecting the said Duty, not exceeding Twelve-pence in the Pound, and the Charges of recovering the same), should be by the said Trustees applied and disposed of to building out a new Head, clearing the Beach, and other Works for securing, amending, and maintaining the said Pier and Harbour of Minehead, and to no other Use and Purpose whatsoever: And it was further enacted, that the said Trustees, or the greater Number of them that should then be living, should be and were thereby empowered, by Indenture under their Hands and Seals, to convey and assure the Duties granted by that Act to any Person or Persons that should advance such Sum or Sums of Money upon such Security j all which Money so to be borrowed should be employed for and towards the building out a new Head, clearing the Beach, and other Works for securing and amending the said Pier and Harbour: And it was further enacted, that it should be lawful for the said Tregonwell Luttrell, Lord of the Manor of Minehead, his Heirs and Assigns, Lords of the said Manor (the Pier having been built and repaired by him and his Ancestors), at the Court Leet to be held for the same Manor after the said Twenty, fourth Day of June One thousand seven hundred and one, and so from Time to Time, as Occasion should require, to appoint a Water Bailiff for the Purposes therein mentioned: And to the End that the said new Head and other Works aforesaid, when finished and made greatly com. modious and useful, might not fall to Decay and Ruin for want of constant and necessary Reparations from Time to Time, it was enacted, that from and after the said Term, and so long as the said Pier or Harbour 9 should

if

4° GEORGII IV. Cap. cxiii.

if such Duties, Rates, and Sums of Money were made applicable, in the first Instance, to the Repairs of the said Harbour and Pier and the Works thereof; and inasmuch as the said Duties, Rates, and Sums of Money granted by the said recited Acts, are not nearly adequate to the Payment of the Interest of the said Mortgage Debt, and in consequence thereof the Interest of the said Mortgage Debt must continue to accumulate, and inasmuch as there is no ultimate Fund for Payment of such Mortgage Debt and Interest beyond the said Duties, Rates, and Sums of Money, by reason whereof the said Mortgage Debt and Interest have become of very little Value to the Persons beneficially interested in the same, by virtue of the Will of the said John Foxvnes Luttrell, deceased, it would be highly advantageous to all Persons claiming under the said Will that such Duties, Rates, and Sums of Money should be accordingly vested in and made payable to the Lord or Lady, Lords or Ladies for the Time being of the said Manor of Minehead for ever, and that the said Mortgage Debt and Interest should be extinguished : And whereas the other Funds provided by the Will of the said John Townes Luttrell, the Testator, are amply sufficient for the Payment of all his Debts, Funeral and Testamentary Expences, and the additional Portions and Legacies in and by his said last Will and Testament and Codicil bequeathed to his Daughters and younger Sons, and the several other pecuniary Legacies thereby bequeathed : And whereas the said John Fownes Luttrell, and Henry Fownes Luttrell, Francis Fownes Luttrell, Alexander Fownes Luttrell, and Thomas Fownes Luttrell, respectively, the Sons; and Mary Anne Fownes Luttrell, Margaret Fownes Luttrell, and Harriett Fownes Luttrell, respectively, the Daughters; and Alexander Fownes Luttrell, and the said Francis Fownes Luttrell, respectively, the Brothers of the said John Fownes Luttrell the Testator, survived the said Testator, but the said Thomas Fownes Luttrell, his Brother, departed this Life in the Lifetime of the said Testator, without Issue; and the said Alexander Fownes Luttrell, his Brother, hath since also departed this Life on or about the Fifteenth Day of August in the Year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and sixteen; and the said Testator John Fownes Luttrell had not after the Date and Publication of his said Will any Child born, nor any posthumous Child, and neither of his said Sons and Daughters above-mentioned is married: And whereas the said Francis Fownes Luttrell, the Brother of the said Testator, intermarried with Charlotte Drewe on or about the Twenty-first Day of April One thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, and had Issue by her Twelve Children, namely, Henry Fownes Luttrell, Charlotte Fownes Luttrell, Anne Fownes Luttrell, Caroline Fownes Luttrell, Louisa Frances Fownes Luttrell, Francis Fownes Luttrell, Maria Fownes Luttrell, Mary Frances Fownes Luttrell, Marcia (in her Baptismal Register called Maria) Fownes Luttrell, Francis Drewe Wynne Fownes Luttrell, Edward Fownes Luttrell, and Edward Fownes Luttrell: And whereas the said Henry Fownes Luttrell, the Son of the said Francis Fownes Luttrell, the Brother of the said Testator, departed this Life on or about the Twentieth Day of July in the Year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and thirteen, unmarried : And whereas the said Charlotte Fownes Luttrell, on or about the Ninth Day of August One thousand eight hundred and ten, intermarried with the Reverend Charles Abel Moysey Doctor in Divinity, Archdeacon of Bath, and on or about the Twenty-fourth Day of May One thousand \LocaW] 29 K eight

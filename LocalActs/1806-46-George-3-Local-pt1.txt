said Act authorized to be made, the said Huddersfield Caaai Company were enabled to raise, by the Ways and Means in the said Act mentioned, any further or other Sum of Money for completing and perfecting the said Undertaking, not exceeding the Sum of Ninery thousand Pounds: And whereas by an Act passed in the Thirty-ninth and Fortieth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, An Jiff for enabling the Huddersfield Canal Company to finish and complete the Huddersfield Canal, and for amending the Act passed in the Thirty-fourth Year of the Reign of His prefint Majesty for making and maintaining the said Huddersfield Canal, the said Huddersfield Canal Company were authorized and empowered to make Calls for Momy from the Proprietors of the said Huddersfield Canal, not exceeding Twenty Pounds, upon and in respect of every Share in the said Navigation and Undertaking, and also to raise by creating new or additional Shares, and by other the Ways and Means therein mentioned, such Sum or Sums of Money as should from Time to Time be found necessary for finishing, completing, and maintaining the said Huddersfield Canal and other Works by the said recited Act authorized to be made and done, provided the fame, together with the Calls which might be made by virtue of the now reciting Ad, and so much of the said Sum of One hundred and eighty-four thousand Pounds, as the said Huddersfield Canal Company had been or thereafter should be able to receive, should not exceed^ in the Whole the Sum of Two hundred and seventy-four thousand Pounds, being the Amount of the said Sums of One hundred and eighty-four thousand Pounds and Ninety thousand Pounds: And whereas the said Huddersfield Cmal Company, in pursuance of the Powers contained in the said recited Acts, have raised by Calls from the Proprietors of Shares in the said Canal, and by the Creation of new or additional Shares, the Whole of the said Sum of Two hundred and seventy-four thousand Pounds, or nearly to that Amount, and have expended the lame in the Prosecution of the Works of the said Huddersfield Canal, in which they have made great Progress : And whereas, from the very great Advance in the Price of Labour and all Sorts of Materials, the Expences of prosecuting the Works of the said Huddersfield Canal have increased very considerably beyond the Estimatcs originally made by the Su'veyors or Engineers of the said Company ; and the Difficulties which have arisen in driving and making the Tunnel on the Summit Level of the said Canal (of which a great Part Hill remains to be made and completed) have occasioned much greater Expences than were originally expected or could be foreseen ; and it is expedient that the said Huddersfield Canal Company should be enabled to finiffi and complete the Whole of their said Works; and it is found that the Powrs and Provisions of the aforesaid Acts are insufficient for that Purpose ; May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted ; and be it en-xffc-d by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same.

Stable, Cellar, Vault, Building, Garden, Court Yard, or Tenement (except such as in the said Act: is excepted) which then was or thereafter should be situate in any of the Streets, Lanes, or other publick Passages or [Loc! & Per.'] IT Places

Mode of adjusting the First Account mentioned in the Act, respecting Utensils, Materials, Furniture, &c.

It will be necessary for the Referees or Arbitrators who are to ascertain the Quota which each Parish is to contribute towards discharging the Debt, and the general Charges attending the House, to call upon the Officers of every Parish for their Assessments and Accounts, in order to fee what they have paid to their Poor on a Medium of three Years preceding the Easter Monday Onethoufand Eight hundred and One, who are required by the Act to produce them, under a Penalty for Refusal.

"When the Arbitrators have got these Materials, it will be necessary to separate and deduct every Matter which does not relate to the Poor} for instance, Money paid to the County Rates, or for the Expences of the Constable, Headborough, or Militia, which are all now included in the Poors Rates j and as some of the Parishes may have had Expences occasioned by Litigations about Settlements and Removals, and others may not, they should exclude all such Expences from the Account.

XXV. And whereas the Borough and Parish of Liverpool aforesaid, Boundaries adjoin on the South Side thereof to the Township of Toxteth Park, on between the East Side to the Township of West Derby, and on the East and North- *risl1 of east to the Township of Everton: And whereas between the said Borough an^Town-and Parish and the said Townships of Toxteth Park and West Derby, ships of certain Streets have been formed as Boundary Streets, and a certain Toxteth Park, Street has also been formed between the said Borough and Parish and ^Everton' the said Township of Everton, as far as the South End of a Garden of ” r n‘ John Lightbody Esquire, situated at the Back of a certain Place called Birchfield, in Liverpool, aforesaid; but the actual Division between the

said Borough and Parish and the said Townships, runs in many Places in the said Streets in very irregular Lines, and it would be very beneficial to the Inhabitants of the said Borough and Parish and Townships respectively, and tend much to the Prevention of Disputes and Differences, if the Boundaries between the same were defined and ascertained, and in some Places in a trifling Degree straightened, changed, and altered, and if such Boundaries were precisely declared and specified in this present Act; be it therefore enacted, That from and after the passing this Act the Southern Boundary between the said Borough and Parish and the said Township of Toxteth Park, shall be and be considered as the South Side of Parliament Street and of Upper Parliament Street, as far as lineable with the East Side of a certain Street called Crown Street; that the Eastern Boundary between the said Borough and Parish and the Township of West Derby aforesaid, shall be and be considered as the [Local.'] 3 T East

East Side of the said Street called Crown Street, running between Upper Parliament Street aforesaid, and Pembroke Place, the Line of a certain ancient Ditch or Watercourse between Pembroke Place and London Road, at the Distance of Six Feet Eastwardly, from the present Walls of the Yards or Inclosures of the Houses there, and the East Side of a certain Street called Moss Street, which runs between the London Road and Upper Islington; and that the North-eastern Boundary between the said Borough and Parish, and the Township of Evert on aforesaid, shall be the Northeast Side of a certain Street called or intended to be called Carver Street, which runs at the Back of and in a parallel Direction with Upper Islington aforesaid, as far as the South End of the Garden of the said John Light-body; which said Boundaries are more particularly delineated on a Plan, and Two Duplicates of the same, which have been signed by the Mayor and Bailiffs of the said Borough, by the Surveyors of the Highways of the Parish of Liverpool aforesaid, and by the respective Surveyors ol the Highways of the said Townships of Toxteth Park, West Derby, and Everton; one of which Plans shall be deposited amongst the Records of the Corporation of Liverpool aforesaid, another in the Parish Church of Saint Nicholas, and the Third in the Parish Church of Walton on the Hill, in which Parish the said Townships of Toxteth Park, West Derby, and Everton, are situate; and which said Plans, or any of them, shall and may be produced upon all Occasions as Evidence of the respective Boundaries herein-before defined between the said Borough and Parish of Liverpool, and the said Townships of Toxteth Park, West Derby, and Everton, respectively.

And whereas in consequence of the Division or Boundary between the said Borough and Parish, and the said Townships of Toxteth Park, West Derby, and Everton, having heretofore run in an irregular Line, the Liability to the Repairs of the said Boundary Streets has in some Instances extended only to one Side of the same; and it would be much more convenient and advantageous to the respedive Townships and to the said Borough and Parish, and the Pavement of the said Streets would be much better and more effectually done if the Liability of the

* 4 said

1“ GEORGII IV. Cap.xiii. 259

said Townships to the Repairs and paving of the said Streets were extended so as to comprize both Sides of the same within certain Limits therein, such Limits not containing more superficial Yards than those which the said Townships would respectively be liable to pave and repair in a different Direction in or on one Side only of the said Streets; be it therefore enacted, That the Parts or Portions herein-after specified of the said Street called Upper Parliament Street, so made as aforesaid, between the said Borough and Parish, and the Township of Toxteth Park aforesaid, the Pavement of which hath been already completed, shall, from and after the passing of this Act, be repaired and repairable by the Inhabitants of the said Township of Toxteth Park, notwithstanding the same are situate within the said Parish of Liverpool, that is to say, Twenty-two thousand four hundred Square Yards, commencing from the East Side of a certain Street called or intended to be called Windsor Street, and extending to the East Side of the said Street called Crown Street; and that the Parts or Portions herein-after specified of the said Streets so made between the said Borough and Parish and the Township of West Derby aforesaid, shall, from and after the Completion of the Pavement of the said Streets, by such Persons or Parties as are now liable thereto by Law, or under any Agreement entered into, be repaired and repairable by the Inhabitants of the said Township of West Derby, notwithstanding the same are situate within the said Borough and Parish of Liverpool, that is to say,

An Act for more effectually repairing and improving several Districts of Malmesbury Turnpike Roads, and other Roads connected therewith, in the Counties of Wilts, Berks, and Gloucester.

[22d June 1820.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the Thirty-eighth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, intituled An Act for more effectually repairing, widening, 38G.3.< and improving the Road from Tetbury, in the County of Gloucester, to and through Malmesbury, to the Churchway in Lower Stanton Field, in the County of Wilts, there to join the Turnpike Road, leading from Chippenham Bridge to Lower Stanton aforesaid, and from Malmesbury to the Turnpike Road at or near Jackament’s Bottom, in the said County of Gloucester, and also the Road from Farringdon to Cricklade, from thence to Malmesbury, and to the Turnpike Road at Acton Turville, and also from Sherstone to the Turnpike Road leading from Tetbury to Bath; and for making, maintaining, widening and improving several other Roads communicating therewith; which Roads were by the said Act divided into Two Districts, as therein particularly described, and placed under the Care and Management of separate Trustees, thereby appointed for such Districts respec-[Local.~\ 9 M tively:

tively: And whereas considerable Sums of Money have been borrowed on the Credit of the Tolls authorized to be collected upon each of the said Districts, which Money still remains due and owing: And whereas that Part of the Second District of Road, which extends from Acton Turville to Downend, in the said County of Gloucester, hath been proceeded upon, but at present remains incomplete and unfinished; and by reason of the great Length of the same District, and the Distance of that Part, from the Upper Part thereof, it would be more conveniently and properly attended to, if the same were’detached from the other Parts of that District, and formed into another District, and placed under the Care and Management of separate Trustees, and other requisite Officers residing in that Neighbourhood: And whereas divers Sums of Money have been borrowed on the Credit of the Tolls to arise on the said last-mentioned Line of Road exclusively, which Sums still remain due and owing; and it is expedient that the same, together with all other Monies which may hereafter be advanced and lent on the Credit of the Tolls of the said last-mentioned Line of Road, should be more effectually secured by Mortgage of the said Tolls, under the Authority of this Act: And whereas the Public Highway now leading from and out of the Road from Malmesbury to Chippenham, at or near a certain Place called Kingway, to and through the Village of Hul-lavington, unto the Turnpike Road leading from Upper Stanton to Grittleton, is very much out of repair, narrow, and incommodious, and cannot be properly amended, widened, and kept in Repair by the ordinary Course or Law; and it would be of public Utility if the same were either made good, or Part thereof shut up, and a shorter Road made from or near to CorSton Bridge, by certain Lands called the Downs and Topsails, to and through the said Village of Hullavington to the said Stanton and Grittleton Road, and added to the said First District of Road:And whereas it would be also more convenient to the Public, if Power were given to the Trustees of the Second District of Road, to stop up that Part of the present Road which leads from the Village of Charlton, by Smith's Mill, to Whychurch Marsh Gate, or otherwise to discontinue the same as a Turnpike Road, and make it Private only for the Use of the Owners and Occupiers of the adjoining Lands, and in the Stead and Place thereof to repair, amend, widen, make and maintain as Turnpike a Road from Charlton Heath or Moor, or Noah's Ark, by Garsdon, and Milhorn Common, into the Road there leading to Malmesbury, at or near to HolloWay Bridge: And whereas many Parts of the said Roads comprized in both the said Districts might be greatly improved, and it would be of general Utility if Power were given to widen, divert, turn, shorten. Vary and alter several Parts of the said Roads, and more particularly to shorten the Distance between the Towns of Cricklade and High-worth, and avoid the Blunsdon and JVidhill Hills, by making the .Road Turnpike from Seven Bridges, in the present Track through Golden Rose Lane, and along Hahnington Laum, or Part of Han-nington Lawn, in the best Line to join the present Turnpike Road again at or near Stanton Water, on the West Side Of Hampton and Highworth; and also to shorten the Distance between Highworth and Farringdon, by cutting or passing through the Parsonage Yard and Land on the East Side of the said Town of Highworth, and making 6 the

1° GEORGII IV. Cap.xxxii. 783

the Road straight into the Turnpike Road again, close to the Messuage of Randle Pedley in Eastrop, in the Occupation of Thomas Hopper: And whereas the said Roads cannot be effectually made, amended, diverted, varied, altered, widened, straightened, improved, maintained, and kept in Repair, and the said Second District cannot be divided; nor can the Sums of Money so borrowed as aforesaid, or the Interest thereof be paid, unless the Term of the said recited Act (which is now near expiring), be continued; and it would be more convenient to the Trustees for executing the said Act, and beneficial to the Roads herein-before mentioned and described, if the said recited Act Were repealed, and further, better, and more effectual Powers granted, consolidated, and comprized in one Act: But the same cannot be effected without the Aid and Authority of Parliament:May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act Former Act the said recited Act made in the Thirty-eighth Year of the Reign of rPe^’.and His late Majesty King George the Third, shall be and the same is vided*into hereby declared to be repealed; and that this Act shall from thence- Three Dis-forth commence, take effect, and be put in Execution for and during tricts. the Term herein-after mentioned, for the Purpose of making, amending, diverting, varying, altering, widening, straightening, improving, maintaining, and keeping in Repair the several Roads hereinafter described; (that is to say), the present Turnpike Road leading The F; rst from the Town of Tetbury in the County of Gloucester, to and District set through the Borough of Malmesbury to the Site of Ground whereon out and a Cottage formerly stood, adjoining to the Churchway in Lower Stan- descriljed-ton Field, in the County of Wilts, there joining the Turnpike Road leading from Chippenham Bridge to Lower Stanton aforesaid; and the Road leading from the High Cross, in the Borough of Malmesbury, to the Turnpike Road leading from Cirencester in the County of Gloucester, to Tetbury aforesaid, at or near a Place called Jackamenfs Bottom in the said County; and the Road (by this Act intended to be made Turnpike) leading from and out of the said present Turnpike Road from Malmesbury to Chippenham, at or near the aforesaid Place called Kingway, to and through the Village of Hullavington, unto the Turnpike Road leading from Upper Stanton to Grittleton, or else from the said present Turnpike Road from Malmesbury to Chippenham, at or near to Corston Bridge, by the Downs and Topsails, to and through the said Village of Hullavington, to the said Stanton and Grittleton Road; which several Roads aforesaid do pass through or lie in the Parishes, Tifchings, or Places of Malmesbury, Saint Paul Malmesbury, the Abbey Malmesbury, Saint Mary Westport, Newnton, Brokenborough, Milborne, Whychurch, Charlton, Hankerton, Crudwell,

[27th June 1823.]

WHEREAS Sir Samuel Romilly, late of Russell Square in the County of Middlesex, Knight, deceased, duly made and published his last Will and Testament in Writing, bearing Date the Nineteenth Day of August One thousand eight hundred and fifteen, and executed in such Manner as by Law is required for passing Real Estates by Devise, whereby (amongst other Things) he appointed his Wife the Guardian of all his Children during her Life, but if she should die during the Minority of any of them, he appointed his good Friend John Whishaw of Lincoln's Inn Guardian of his Sons, and Mary Whittaker his Wife’s Sister Guardian of his Daughter; and the said Testator (after giving and bequeathing various specific and pecuniary Legacies) gave to his said Wife all his Freehold Estates not therein-before devised by him for the Term of her Life, and he gave her an absolute Power by Deed or Will to dispose of all such Estates in any Way that she might think fit; but in Default of her exercising that Power, he directed that his said Freehold Estates, or such Parts thereof as she should not have disposed of, should at her Death be divided into a Number of Shares equal to the Number of Children he should then have living and One more \ and [Private.'] 4 n that

that his then eldest Son should have Two such Shares, and each of his other Children One such Share, to them and their Heirs, as Tenants in Common, and the said Testator thereby appointed his said Wife Executrix of his said Will; And whereas the said Testator added a Codicil to his said Will, bearing Date the Twenty-seventh Day of March in the Year One thousand eight hundred and seventeen, and duly executed and attested for the Devise of Real Estates, whereby (after stating that since making his said Will, he had contracted to purchase from the Trustees of Lord Llandaff an Estate in Glamorganshire for Twenty-one thousand Pounds) the said Testator declared it to be his Will, that the said Purchase should be completed out of his Personal Estate, and that the said Estate should go to the same Uses and for the same Purposes as the Bulk of his Real Estates devised by his said in part recited Will: And whereas the said Testator added another Codicil to his said Will, duly executed and attested for the Devise of Real Estates, and bearing Date on or about the Fourth Day of October in the Year One thousand eight hundred and eighteen, whereby he directed that if his said Wife whom he had by his said Will appointed Guardian of his Children should die before him, he thereby appointed Colonel John Garbett Walsham to be such Guardian; and if he should happen to die during the Minority of any of his Children, or should from ill Health decline to take upon himself the Office of their Guardian, the said Testator in that Case appointed William Marquis of Lansdowne, and JohnlFhishaw, to be their Guardians; and the said Testator stated that he had purchased of the Trustees of Lord JLlandaff, and had had conveyed to him the said Estate in Glamorganshire, which he thereby devised to the same Uses as he had by his Will devised the Residue of his Real Estates: And whereas the said Testator added another Codicil to his said Will, whereby he appointed the said John Whishaw Executor of his Will, together with the Executors already named : And whereas the said Testator departed this Life in the Month of November in the Year One thousand eight hundred and eighteen, and the said Will and Codicils (together with other Codicils to his said Will not affecting the Devises herein-before contained, or the Appointments of Guardians and Executors herein-before stated) were, on or about the Second Day of January in the Year One thousand eight hundred and nineteen, duly proved by the said John Whishaw alone, in the Prerogative Court of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and all the Debts of the said Testator, and the Legacies and Annuities given by his said Will and Codicils, have been paid or provided for : And whereas Ann Romilly the Wife of the said Testator, and the Executrix and Devisee named in his said recited Will, departed this Life in the Life-time of the said Testator : And whereas the Marriage of the said Sir Samuel Romilly with Ann Garbett his said Wife took place on or about the Third Day of January in the Year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight, and at the Time of the Decease of the said Sir Samuel Romilly there were Seven Children of the said Marriage, namely, William Romilly the eldest Son and Heir at Law, Sophia Romilly now the Wife of Thomas Francis Kennedy Esquire, John Romilly, Edward Romilly, Henry Romilly, Charles Romilly, and Frederick Romilly, who at the Time of the Decease of the said Sir Samuel Romilly were all Infants under the Age of Twenty-one Years, and no other Issue : And whereas John Garbett Walsham Esquire of Knill Court in the County of Hereford, Brother in Law of the said Testator, (called in the said recited Will Colonel John Garbett Walshain) departed

this Life very shortly after the said Sir Samuel Romilly, never having in his Life-time proved the said recited Will or exercised the Office of Guardian of the Children of the said Testator : And whereas the Real Estate comprized in the said Devises herein-before recited consisted of the Manors, Messuages, Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments in the Counties of Glamorgan, Hereford, and Radnor, specified and described in the First Schedule to this Act: And whereas the Most Honourable Henry now Marquis of Lansdowne was Marquis of Lansdowne at the Date of the said recited Will, and was the Person intended by the said Testator, although by Mistake called by the Christian Name of William, and he hath acted with the said John Whishaw in the Trusts of the said Will and as G uardian of the said Testator’s Children : And whereas under or by virtue of an Indenture of 2d of Janu-Release (grounded on an Indenture of Lease for a Year) bearing Date on gamuel or about the Second Day of January One thousand seven hundred and Romilly’s ninety-eight, and made or expressed to be made between Francis Garbett Marriage of Knill Court in the County of Hereford, Esquire, and Ann Garbett Spinster Settlement, his eldest Daughter, afterwards the said Ann Romilly the Testator’s Wife, of the First Part, Sophia Garbett of Knill Court aforesaid, Spinster, of the Second Part, the said Sir Samuel Romilly then Samuel Romilly Esquire of the Third Part, and John Garbett of Lincoln's Inn in the County of Middlesex aforesaid, Esquire (afterwards the said John Garbett Walsh am), and John Bell of the same Place, Esquire, of the Fourth Part (being the Settlement made previous to the hdarriage then intended, and which was afterwards duly solemnized between the said Sir Samuel Romilly and Ann Garbett) and by reason of the Deaths of the said Ann Romilly and of the said Sir Samuel Romilly without having exercised the Power of Appointment reserved by the said Indenture of Release, the said Seven Children of the said Sir Samuel Romilly became and now are seised of the Lands and Hereditaments in the County of Radnor described in the Second Schedule to this Act as Tenants in Common in equal Shares in Fee Simple : And whereas by an Indenture, bearing Date on or about the Seventh Day of 7th of July July One thousand eight hundred and twenty, and made or expressed to ^r8

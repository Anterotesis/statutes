e.109. the Third, intituled An Act to empower the Trustees for amending the Road from Uttoxeter to Newcastle-under-Lyme in the County of Stafford to repair and widen the Road branching out of the said Road at Lower Lane to the Turnpike Road on Hem Heath in the same County: And whereas another Act was passed in the Forty-second Year of the

.e.98. Reign of His said late Majesty King George the Third, intituled An Act for continuing the Term, and altering and enlarging the Powers of several Acts, passed in the Thirty-second Tear of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Second, and in the Third and Eighteenth T°.ars of the Reign of His present Majesty, for repairing, widening, and amending the Roads from the Town of Uttoxeter to the Town of Newcastle-under-Lyme, and from Cliff Bank to Snape Marsh, and also from Lower Lane to Hem Heath, all in the County of Stafford ; by which now reciting Act, the Roads comprehended in the said Second District, were again subdivided into Two other Districts, One of which Districts was thereby directed to be called The Newcastle-under-Lyme District, and to comprize the Road from the Town of Newcastle-under-Lyme, to and through the Villages and Places of Stoke-upon-Trent, Lane Delph, Lane End, and Meer, and from thence to a Dwelling House on Blyth Marsh, then in the Tenure of Thomas Bromley, and also the Roads from Cliff Bank to Snape Marsh aforesaid, and from Lower Lane to Hem Heath aforesaid ; and in and by the now reciting Act it was provided, that One Moiety or Half Part of the Debts which were then owing upon the Credit of the said before-mentioned Second District, should thereafter be charged (as between the Two Districts created by the now reciting Act) upon the said Newcastle-under-Lyme District, and that the other Moiety or Half Part of the same Debts should thereafter be charged (as between the same Two Districts) upon a District of Roads constituted by the now reciting Act, and thereby directed to be called The Uttoxeter District; and the Repayment of the Entirety of the said Debts was guaranteed to the several Creditors, upon the Tolls arising as well within the said Newcastle-under-Lyme District, as within the said Uttoxeter District: And whereas the principal Sum of Two thousand and five hundred Pounds besides Interest, (being the Amount of the Debts charged in the Manner aforesaid upon the said Two last mentioned Districts) is now due upon Mortgage of the Tolls arising as well within the said Newcastle-under-Lyme District, as within the said Uttoxeter District, and in conformity with the Provisions of the said lastly recited Act, the Interest of the said Debt is defrayed at the joint and equal Charge of the said Two Districts: And whereas the Term and Powers of the said recited Acts will shortly expire, and it is expedient to make Provision by Law, not only for the Security and Repayment of the said Debt so due and owing as aforesaid, but also for the Maintenance and Repair of the several Roads comprized in the said Newcastle-under-Lyme District: And whereas certain Parts of the Roads comprized in the said Newcastle-under-Lyme District are narrow and inconvenient, and as the said Roads pass through a very populous Country, it is of great Importance to the Public Safety and Accommodation that effectual Powers should be granted for widening and improving such narrow and inconvenient Parts of the said Roads: And whereas it would improve the Communications between the Town of Newcastle-under-Lyme and Part of the neighbouring Potteries of Staffordshire, and would be of considerable public Utility, if a new Branch of Road were made and main-9 tained.

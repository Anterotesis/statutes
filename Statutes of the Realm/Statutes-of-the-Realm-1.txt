Most Gracious Sovereigns

WE, Your MajestyÕs most dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament assembled, having taken into our Consideration the State of the Public Records of this Kingdom, and the Necessity of providing for the better Arrangement, Preservation, and more convenient Use of the same, humbly beg leave to lay before Your Majesty the Report of our Proceedings thereon; and to represent to Your Majesty, that in several of the Principal Offices we have found the Public Records preserved with great Order and Regularity, and in some few, with a Method and Care which are exemplary; but that, in many of the most important Offices, they are wholly unarranged, undescribed, and un.ascertained ; that some of them are exposed to Erasure, Alteration, and Embezzlement, and others are lodged in Places where they are daily perishing by Damp, or incurring a continual Risk of Destruction by Fire.

A Period of nearly Seventy Years has elapsed since the last General Parliamentary Inquiry upon this Subject; and, during this Interval of Time, the Change which has taken place in the Language and written Character of Judicial Proceedings, as well as the large Accumulation of Materials which has been progressively superadded in every Department, have increased th¡ Difficulties of methodizing the several Repositories, or applying tneir Contents to Purposes of practical Use.

¥ ¥¥

VU1

In the Course of our Inquiry we have found that many of the Public Buildings allotted to these Uses, and especially those Buildings which belong to Your MajestyÕs Exchequer in all its Branches, comprehending the ancient Records and. Muniments of the Rights and Possessions of the Crown, and the Vouchers and Accounts of the Public Revenues and Expenditure, are in a State so incommodious and insecure, as to require immediate Attention.

It has also appeared to us, that the salutary Measures heretofore adopted by Your MajestyÕs Authority, for methodizing the Contents of some of the principal Repositories of Your MajestyÕs Records and Papers of State, might also be extended to many other Repositories, with Conse.quences highly beneficial to the Public Service.

And the same Motives which encouraged our Predecessors to intreat Your MajestyÕs Directions for printing the ancient Records of Domesday, and the Rolls of Parliament, have also induced us to submit to Your MajestyÕs Wisdom, our Desire of extending the same Measure to other ancient and valuable Monuments of our History, Laws, and Government.

Your Faithful Commons do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty, that You will be graciously pleased to give such Directions as Your Majesty, in Your great Wisdom, shall think fit, for the better Preservation, Arrangement, and more convenient Use of the Public Records of this Kingdom.

And we beg leave further to assure Your Majesty that whatever extraordinary Expences may be incurred by the Directions which Your Majesty, in Your great Wisdom, shall think fit to give on this Occasion, shall be chearfully provided for and made good by Your faithful Commons.

JOURNAL OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,

Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer reported to the House, That their Address of Friday last, (that His Majesty would be graciously pleased to give such Directions as He shall think fit, for the better Preservation, Arrangement, and more convenient Use of the Public Records of this Kingdom, and to assure His Majesty, that whatever extraordinary Expenses may be incurred by the Directions which His Majesty shall think fit to give on this Occasion, shall be made good by His faithful Commons,) had been presented to His Majesty ; and that His Majesty had commanded him to acquaint this House, that He will give Directions as desired by the said Address.

Sect. I.

Former printed Collections, Translations, and Abridgements of the Statutes.

AN Historical Enumeration and Description of antecedent Publications of the Statutes, will best contribute to a right Understanding of the Necessity, and Origin of the present Undertaking; and of the Principles upon which it has been planned and executed.

All the Publications in Print of General Collections, Translations, and Abridgements of the Statutes, and of the Ads of particular Sessions, which have been hitherto discovered, are specified in Two Catalogues subjoined to this Introduction.

The Statute Rolls previous to the beginning of the Reign of Henry VII. being sometimes in Latin and some.times in French, and from that Time uniformly in English, the Printed Editions, according to their several Periods, contain the Statutes, either ist. In the Languages in which they were respectively passed, proclaimed, or printed ; during various Periods from the Time of Hen. III. to the End of the Reign of Ric. III. without any Translation : Or a'"1', Translated for the whole or some Part of those Periods; and during subsequent Periods, in English : Or 3dly, In Latin and in French respectively to the End of Edward IV. or Ric. III. inclusive, with or without a Translation; and in English from the beginning of Ric. Ill, or of Hen. VII.

The earliest of the Printed Editions or Collections above referred to, is an Alphabetical Abridgement of Statutes, as well previous as subsequent to Edw. III. in Latin and French, the latest Statute in which is 33 Hen. VI. A. D. 1455. This is supposed to have been published before 1481.

Another very early Edition, but supposed to be later than the preceding, and to have been printed about 1482, is a Collection of the Statutes, not abridged, from 1 Edw. III. to 22 Edw. IV. in Latin and French : This and the preceding Article are attributed to the joint labours of the Printers Lettou and Machlinia.

The Statutes passed in the only Parliament holden by Richard III. were printed, in French, by Caxton or Machlinia, or both, soon after they were passed, this being the first Instance of a Sessional Publication. The like Course was observed in the Reigns of Henry VII. and Henry VIII. from which Time the Statutes appear to have been regularly printed and published at the End of each Session.

The Collection printed by Pynson, probably about the Year 1497, Õ3 Hen. VII. but certainly before 1504, 19 Hen. VII, contains the Statutes from 1 Edw. III. to 1 Richard III. inclusive, in Latin and in French respec.tively j and those from 1 to 12 Hen. VII. in English.

The small Edition of the Antiqua Statuta first printed by Pynson in 1508, and afterwards frequently reprinted, contains Magna Carta, Carta de Foresta, the Statutes of Merton, Marlbridge, Westminster 1. and 2., and other Statutes previous to 1 Edward III. in Latin and French respectively. These are the earliest Printed Copies now known of those Statutes.

The Abridgement of the Statutes in English, to 11 Hen. VIII. translated and printed by John Rastall, is preceded by a Preface on the Propriety of the Laws being published in English. This appears to be the fust English Abridge.ment of the Statutes : and it helps to ascertain the Period when the Statutes were first Ò cndited and writtenÓ in English ; as the Preface ascribes that Measure to Henry VII. Subsequent English Abridgements were published at various Times by Rastall and other Printers.

Various Editions of the Alphabetical Abridgement of the Statutes, above mentioned as published before 1481, were from time to time printed ; enlarged by the Abridgement of subsequent Statutes: Of these the Edition by Owen, including the Statutes of 7 Hen. VIII. was printed in 1521. An Appendix, containing the Abridgement of the ACts of the next ensuing Session, 15 Hen. VIII, was printed in 1528, when a Title was added. These Collections form an Exception to the general Description of the Editions of the Statutes; for not only the Statutes previous to and in the Reign of Ric. III. are abridged in Latin or French, but the Abridgement of the Statutes of Hen. VII. and Hen. VIII. is in French, although they were originally passed and printed in English.

In 1531 Berthelet printed an Edition of the Antiqua Statuta, similar to the Editions by Pynson, with some Additions. In 1532 Berthelet also printed a Collection of Statutes previous to i Edw. III. not included in the the Antiqua Statuta. This Collection he entitled Ò Secunda Pars Veterum Statutorum,Ó and it is always so dis.tinguished : It was frequently reprinted. The Statutes contained in it are in French and Latin respectively.

Neither in the Antiqua Statuta by Pynson, nor in the Secunda Pars Veterum Statutorum, were the Contents arranged with any Chronological Accuracy : In the Antiqua Statuta the Two Charters, and the Statutes of Merton, and Marlbridge, and Westminster 1 and 2, are placed first, and the other Matters follow in a very confused Manner. No better Order is preserved in the Secunda Pars. These Two Parts of the Vetera Statuta were frequently reprinted together. The Edition of them by Tottell in 1356 is the most known: This varies from PynsonÕs and BertheletÕs, in some Readings of the Text of the Statutes; and it is enlarged by the Addition of Ò certain Statutes with other needful Things taken out of Old Copies examined by the Rolls,Ó printed at the End of the First Part. Editions by Tottell in 1576, and 1587, and later Editions by various Printers, insert only a partial Selection of Antient Statutes, with further various Readings, and add some modern Statutes. On a Com.parison, made for the Purpose of ascertaining the FaCt, there is reason to conclude that the Copy used by Lord Coke in his Second Institute was that of 1587.

The earliest Printed Translation, not abridged, of the Charters, and of several Statutes previous to i Edw. III. appears to have been made by Ferrers, a Member of Parliament, from the Editions of the Vetera Statuta and Secunda Pars before noticed; It was first printed in 1534, and contains the greatest Part, but not all, of the Matters included in those Editions, but does not arrange them in Chronological Order. In 1540 and 1542, other Editions of this Translation were published, with some Amendments and Additions.

In 1543, The Statutes in English, from the time of Henry III. to 19 Hen. VII. inclusive, chronologically arranged, were printed by Berthelet, in one Volume, Folio. It has not been satisfactorily ascertained that any complete chrono.logical Series of the Statutes from Magna Carta to 1 Edw. III., either in their Original Language, or in English, or that any Translation of the Statutes from 1 Edw. III. to 1 Hen. VII. had been published previous to this Edition by Berthelet; though some Books refer to Editions by Berthelet as of 1529 and 1540.' It appears probable that the Translation in this Edition by Berthelet was made from the small Editions of the Vetera Statuta and Secunda Pars, and from PynsonÕs Edition of the Nova Statuta 1 Edw. III. to t Ric. III. inclusive. This Edition contains some Translations, particularly of the Diflum de Kenilworth, not included in either of the Editions of FerrersÕs Transla.tions : With respeCt to the others previous to 1 Edw. III. it agrees in general with the Second Edition of FerrersÕs Translation ; and Cay, in the Preface to his Edition of the Statutes, conjectures that the Whole of the Translation in this Edition was made by Ferrers. No Translation of the Statuta Wallies 12 Edw. I. is given either by Ferrers or in any subsequent Edition: Several other Statutes also have been always printed without Translations.

Ò The Great Boke of Statutes Ó commences with 1 Edw. III. and ends with 34 Hen. VIII. It is entirely in English. It appears to have been published at different Times, in separate Parts; and it seems not unlikely that the earliest Part may have been published previous to the English Edition printed by Berthelet in 1543, from which it differs in some Particulars: Of such Difference one Instance is the Insertion of Cap. 7. of 2 Ric. II. Stat. 1. respecting Pope Urban, which is omitted in Berthelet 1543 and subsequent Editions ; from whence it seems probable that this Part was published before the severe Prohibitions, by the ACts of Hen. VIII, against acknowledging the Papal Power.

William Rastall (or Rastell) who in 1557 published his first Edition of a Collection of all the Statutes which were before that Year imprinted, was a Serjeant at Law; and was made a Judge in 1558. In this Collection the Statutes are distributed under apt Titles in Alphabetical Order, the Preambles for the most part being omitted, and a brief Mention only made of such Statutes as were expired or repealed, or of a private or local Nature. It gives all the Statutes to the End of Richard III. in Latin or in French, as they were at first published aud all the subsequent Statutes in English. The same Collection, having the Statutes prior to Henry VII. translated into English, instead of being inserted in their Original Language, was printed about 1579, and reprinted very fre.quently afterwards, until 1621. In these successive Editions, the New Statutes were from Time to Time abridged, and inset ted under their proper Titles. The Translation contained in this Collection appears to have been executed with superior Care and Industry; where it borrows from foregoing Versions, it, occasionally, amends what was faulty : Translations are inserted in it of some Matters not before translated ; of others, Translations entirely new and more faithful are given; and the whole was sedulously revised from Time to Time ; the later Editions, particularly those of 1591 and 1603, correcting Errors which had escaped Notice in the earlier Editions. Rastall died in 1565, and it is not known by whom these English Editions of the Collection bearing his Name, were prepared, or edited.

For many wordes and termes be there in divers Statutes, both in latin and in frcnche, which be very hard to translate aptly into English.ÓÑEpistle or Preface prefixed to W. RastallÕs Collection -, Edit. 1337. In the Edition of 1579 and the subsequent Editions, this Sentence is omitted from the Preface.

e

The Edition of the Statutes in English, by Barker, in Two Volumes Folio, frequently bound up in one, ending with 29 Eliz, the Title to which affords the earliest Instance of the Term Ò Statutes at Large,Ó agrees in general, as to the Statutes previous to 1 Hen. VII, with the English Edition by Berthelet in 1543.

After the Edition of RastallÕs Collection in English in 1579, it does not appear that any of the Statutes from 1 Edw. III. to 1 Hen. VII. were printed in Latin or French, until some of them were so printed in the Edition by Hawkins in 1735.

The English Edition 1618, which in the Title Page is said to contain all the Adis at any Time extant in Print until t6 Jac. I., published by the KingÕs Printers, Norton and Bill, in Two Volumes large Folio, is usually called Ò RastallÕs Statutesalthough the Editor of the Collections before noticed, had been long deceased. The latest Acts inserted in this Edition are of 7 Jac. I. being the last Session preceding the Publication. The Translation of the Statutes previous to Hen. VII. does not follow the improved Translation adopted in the Editions of RastallÕs Collection in English ; It agrees with the Translations of Berthelet 1543, and Barker 1587; except that it is not so corredtly printed.

In the same Year 1618, A Collection, in English, of sundry Statutes frequent in use, ending with 7 Jac. I. was published by Pulton. Several Statutes, not included in the Edition called RastallÕs 1618, are for the first Time translated in this Edition, and are so noted to be in the Preface ; the most important of these are, Ordinatio pro Statu Hibernie, as of 17 Edw. I. but being, in fad, of 17 Edw. II.Ordinatio Forests, 34 Edw. I.;ÑDe Asportatis Religiosorum, 35 Edw. I.;ÑDe Terris Templariorum, 17 Edw. II. Several subsequent Editions of this Collection were printed after the Death of Pulton: Those of 1635 and 1640 are remarkable for giving the progressive Answers to the Petition of Right, 3 Car. I. and the KingÕs Speech on pronouncing the Assent, Ò Soit droit fait come il est desirewhich are not contained in any other general Collections; though they were printed by Authority in the Sessional Publication of the Statutes of that Year.

As this English Edition by Pulton has been much copied by subsequent Editors of the Statutes, it deserves particular Notice.*

The original Edition published in 1618, contained many Corrections of the then existing Translation, by rendering it more conformable to the Records in the Tower ; and further Corrections were from Time to Time made in the subsequent Editions: But several Errors and Inconsistencies were suffered to remain in consequence of the Translation following the old Printed Copies of the Latin and French Text, which frequently differ from those Records.1 Some of the Corrections made in the various Editions of the English Collection called Rastall's, were indeed adopted; but several Matters translated in RastallÕs English Collection, are not included in PultonÕs, particularly several of the Statutes of Uncertain Date, usually classed together after the Reign of Edw. II. A Change of Phraseology also is occasionally made in Pulton, not always to the Improvement of the Translation. Titles are put at the Heads of the several Chapters, which are in fact intended as Abridgements of their Contents, and which were not given in former Editions to the Chapters of any Statute previous to Edw. IV : though in the Chronological Table of Statutes subjoined to RastallÕs Collection, Titles of a similar Kind occur from the Begin.ning of the Reign of Edward III. Several Parts or Chapters of the Statutes subsequent to 1 E. 111. are omitted, and only noticed by the Titles or Abridgements.

From 161S to 1735 great B¡dy of the Statutes continued to be published entirely in English ; but the small Collections of the Statutes previous to 1 Edw. III. in French and Latin, were frequently reprinted till after 1618, and these were succeeded by the Collection in Lord CokeÕs Second Institute. The Editions bearing ihe Name of Pulton, were continued from time to time from 1618 to 1670; the last by Manby, who had previously edited the Statutes passed in the Time of Car. I. and Car. II.

During the Usurpation partial Collections of ACls for different Series of Years were published, from 1646 to 1654; and an Authentic Collection by Scobell the Clerk of the Parliament, from 1640 to 1656. After the Restoration, Editions of the Statutes Car. I. and Car. Il.we-re published by the KingÕs Printers and others.

In 1676 KebleÕs Edition of the Statutes at large, ending with 27 Car. II. was published by the KingÕs Printers, Ò carefully examined by the Rolls of Parliament.Ó This Edition is in many Instances more correft, as to the Statutes subsequent to Hen. VII., than the Editions by Barker or Pulton, or that called Rastall's 1618 : It was from Time to Time reprinted, and continued by additional Volumes. The Translation of the Statutes previous to Henry VII, contained in all the Editions called KebleÕs, was copied from the latest Edition of Pulton.

The Edition of the Statutes by Serjeant Hawkins, published in 1735 in Six Volumes Folio, ending with 7 Geo. II. contains the respective Latin and French Texts of most of the Statutes to 8 Edw. IV. with Translations of such as had been before translated, and as appeared to him to be in force or use : Of some of these Statutes a Translation only is given, without the Original Text: Of the Statutes and parts of Statutes considered by him as obsolete, or which are expired or repealed, the Original Text is given without a Translation, and occasionally an

Abridgement without either the Text or Translation. From his Preface he seems not to have been aware that the early Statutes had ever been printed in Latin or French, in any Collc&ion except the Second Institute of Lord.Coke; and he gives the Text from the Statute Rolls in the Tower, from ancient Manuscripts, or from the Second Institute ; all in many Instances varying from the earliest Printed Editions. An Appendix is subjoined to the Sixth Volume, containing the Text of some of the more antient Statutes, which are omitted or of which Translations only are given in the Body of the Work; Ò together with some antient Records of Statutes omitted in the Statute Roll, but entered in other Parliamentary Records.Ó Upon the Subject of the Translation, Hawkins thus expresses himself in his Preface: Ò It was proposed to make a new Translation of the French and Latin Statutes, and it must be owned that there are some Mistakes in the Old Translation, but it having, by its long Use, obtained a kind of prescriptive Authority, and seeming for the most Part to have been done with greater Learning and Accuracy than can be expetted from any modern Hand, willing to undertake a Work of such Difficulty, and it being easy for the Reader to correCl the Mistakes in it by the Help of the Original, it was judged most proper to retain it.Ó

CayÕs Edition of the Statutes, published in 1758, in Six Volumes Folio, ending with 30 Geo. II. is very much upon the Plan of HawkinsÕs Edition, with the following Additions : In cases where the Statutes are printed from the Statute Rolls in the Tower, the Numbers of the respective Membranes of the Rolls are quoted ; and in other Cases the several Manuscript Authorities from which they are printed are distinctly cited. The Latin and French Text respectively of several Statutes prior toEdw. III. and the French Text of the Statutes 23 Hen. VI.; 12,14,17, and 22 Edw. IV, which had been omitted by Hawkins, are given from Manuscripts. Several Instruments, not in.cluded in the previous Editions by Hawkins, Pulton, and others, are inserted from the early Printed Copies, and some Matters not contained in any former Edition of the Statutes, are printed from the Parliament Rolls. The Translation of the Statutes previous to Hen. VII. is the same as KebleÕs and PultonÕs: In his Preface, Cay attributes the whole of that Translation to George Ferrers, in the Time of Hen. VIII. and speaks thus of it: Ò It is not a good one, and the Mistakes in it are very numerous and considerable: It has often been desired that a new Translation should be made, but as this has been used for some Ages, not only by the Public in general, but even by the Parliament, and many Statutes are recited in subsequent ACIs in the Words of this Translation, it seems to be too much authenticated for an Editor to presume to reject it.Ó

The Editions by Hawkins and Cay were for some time continued by several Volumes containing the Statutes of subsequent Years.

In 1762 was printed the First Volume of an Edition of the Statutes at Large, which was completed in 1765, by Ruffhead, in Nine Volumes Quarto, ending with the Statutes of 4 Geo. III. In this Edition is included all that was comprehended in CayÕs. Several Matters, however, which by Cay were inserted in the Body of his Work, were printed by Ruffhead, in an Appendix subjoined to the Ninth Volume; and in this Appendix are also introduced some ACIs of Henry VII. and of subsequent Reigns, taken from former Printed Copies, and also from the Parliament Rolls, and the Inrollments of Ads in Chancery. This Edition was reprinted in 1769, &c. and has been regularly continued from time to time by Volumes containing the Statutes of subsequent Years.

PickeringÕs Edition of the Statutes at Large, in Twenty-three Volumes Octavo, ending with the Statutes 1 Geo. III. was printed at Cambridge, and published at various Times between 1762 and 1766. A Twenty-fourth Volume containing the Preface and Index was published in 1769. This Edition contains the same Matters, and for the most part, in the same Order, as CayÕs Edition ; with the Addition of the Statutes afterwards passed, and also of some Instruments and Translations from former Printed Copies, and other Sources, which Ò though deemed antiquatedÓ were added Ò on account of their Public or Constitutional Importance.Ó In an Appendix subjoined to the Twenty-third Volume, some of the Matters are inserted which are contained in RuffheadÕs Appendix. This Edition also has been regularly continued by subsequent Volumes published from time to time.

It should be observed, that the Matters for the first time introduced by Hawkins, Cay, Ruffhead, and Pickering respectively, are few in Number; and that some of them are clearly not entitled to the Character of Statutes.' It is evident also that Ruffhead and Pickering took, each, Advantage of the Circumstance of their Editions being in the course of Publication during the same Period ; and that, in the Insertion of new Matters, they by turns borrowed from each other.

Neither Hawkins, Cay, Ruffhead, nor Pickering take any Notice of the French Text of the Statutes of Richard III. which have been stated by some Writers1 to have been originally in English ; whereas the Editions of the Nova Statuta by Pynson, RastallÕs Collection, and the Sessional Publication of the Statutes of Richard III, prove that the Statutes of that Reign were originally published in French : although, in and after the Reign of Henry VI, many Bills, in the Form of ACts, are entered on the Parliament Roll in English.

The Translation now chiefly in Use, which was first inserted in PultonÕs Edition 1618, and thence copied with a few Corrections into subsequent Editions, and afterwards into those of Keble, Hawkins, Cay, Ruffhead and Pickering successively, does not answer wholly, either to the Text as given from the Records or Manuscripts, or to the Tdxt of any of the Old Printed Editions; the Translation having been in part altered by Pulton and other Editors to suit it to the Text, as taken from the Record, and being in part suffered by them to remain, as in the earliest

Editions, without making the Alterations necessary to remedy Errors, which were equally repugnant to the Old Printed Copies and to the Record. Throughout the whole Translation also Sentences are frequently inserted or omitted, contrary to the Authority of the Latin or French Text, as given from the Record or Manuscript, in the opposite Column of the Book; and the Translation, thus varying from the Text of the Record or Manuscript, is sometimes consistent with, and sometimes contrary to, the Old Printed Copies, which are not at all noticed.

Many palpable Errors and Omissions have been allowed to remain without Notice in all the Translations. Correftions, comparatively very few in Number, were silently made in the Progress of the Editions called PultonÕs and KebleÕs. Those made from Time to Time in RastallÕs English Colleftion, were numerous and important, but they have not been fully adopted in any Editions of the Statutes at large. The Suggestions of Correftions by Notes in the Margin of CayÕs Edition are very rare, comparatively with the numerous Errors aftually existing; but the Number of these Suggestions was somewhat increased in the Edition by RufFhead, though not to any considerable Extent. The like Observations apply to PickeringÕs Edition ; respefting which, however, it is material to notice, that of many of the obsolete, expired, or repealed Statutes or Parts of Statutes, a Translation only is given by PickeriDg, from the Edition by Pulton and that called RastallÕs 1618, with some Amendments; while the Latin or French Text, or an Abridgement in English, is given in the Editions by Hawkins, Cay, and RufFhead.

Upon the whole it is ascertained, That no complete Colleftion has ever been printed containing all the Matters, which at different Times, and by different Editors, have been published as Statutes. The earliest Editions of entire Statutes were printed at the latter End of the Fifteenth Century, and began with the Statutes of Edward III. in their Original Language : The Statutes of Henry III. Edw. I. and F.dw. II. were not printed entire until the beginning of the Sixteenth Century, and then in small Colleftions by themselves in their Original Language: and none of these Printed Copies quote any Record or Manuscript as an Authority for the Text which they exhibit. Later Editions of the Statutes, which combine tht Period previous to Edward III. with that of Edward III. and subsequent Kings, omit the Original Text of the Statutes previous to Henry VII.; giving Translations only of those Statutes, and the subsequent Statutes in English : And the most modern Editions which, in some Instances, insert the Original Text of the Statutes previous to Richard III. from the Statute Roll and ancient Manuscripts, omit the Translation of many Parts of them ; and in other Instances give a Translation without the Text, and also omit many Afts in the Period subsequent to Hen. VII. Further it is to be observed, that the several Printed Editions differ materially from each other in the Text of the Statutes previous to Hen. VIII. The Copy of the Statute of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I. in the Editions printed by Tottell in 1556 and 1587, and by Lord Coke in his Second Institute, varies most materially not only from that in the earlier Printed Editions by Pynson in 1508 and 1514, and by Berthelet in 1531, but also from that in the Edition by Marshe in 1556, the same Year in which the First Edition by Tottell was printed. The Copy of this Statute printed by Hawkins from the Statute Roll in the Tower, varies as well from those printed by Tottell and Lord Coke, as from those by Pynson, Berthelet, and Marshe. This Instance is mentioned, as the Statute of Gloucester is the earliest now existing on any Statute Roll.' Many other Instances occur, even in Cases where the Necessity of Correftness was most peculiarly requisite: Such are the Ancient Statutes relating to the Assize of Bread, the Composition of Weights and Measures, and the Measuring of Land : In all these the Calculations in the several Printed Copies vary from each other, and are all incorreft, some in one Particular, some in another. It may be noted, moreover, that many verbal Vari.ations occur between the several Editions which appear essentially to agree with each other. Thus the Copies in Tottell 1556, 1587, and the Second Institute, though generally accordant, are not precisely so: and the same Observation applies to the Editions by Pynson, Berthelet, and Marshe. These verbal Variations may be said to be innumerable, and though for the mosjt Part minute, they are occasionally important. After the Commence.ment of the Reign of Edward III. a greater Degree of Correftness and Uniformity prevail; but so late as the Reign of Henry VII. some Instances of material Variation continue to be met with. The Afts of Richard III. were printed in French, first by Caxton, and afterwards in PynsonÕs Edition of the Statutes from the Commence.ment of the Reign of Edw. Ill: In the Editions by Berthelet, Barker, and others, these Afts of Ric. III. were

printed in English, agreeing in Substance with the French Text: But in the Editions by Pulton, and subsequent Editors, there are essential Variances in the Translation, not only from the Sense of the French Text, but also from the former English Editions: And even of the Statutes of Henry VII., though always printed in' English, the Copies in the Editions by Pulton, and subsequent Editors, differ in several Instances from those in the earlier Printed Colleftions.

It is moreover ascertained, That no one complete printed Translation of all the Statutes previous to Hen. VII. exists: Sdme which are omitted from Berthelet 1543, and the other early Editions, including that called RastallÕs 1618, are inserted in Pulton 1618, and in Editions since published: On the contrary, several Parts of the Statutes from 1 Edw. III. to 1 Hen. VII., Translations of which are inserted in Berthelet, Rastall, and other Editions, are omitted, and merely Abridgements thereof given, in Pulton and subsequent Editions. All the Statutes therefore which have been hitherto translated can be found only by uniting Pulton 1618 and Rastall 1618, together with RastallÕs English Colleftion, and the English Editions by Berthelet, Middleton, and Barker. Many Errors and Inconsistencies occur in all the Translations, resulting either from Misinterpretation, or from improper Omissions or Insertions; and there are many antient Statutes of which no Translation has ever yet been printed.

1 There is reason to believe, from the Appearance of the Great Roll of Statutes in the Tower, that the Membranes which contained the Statutes preceding the Statute of Gloucester have been detached from those which now exist.

Sect. II.

Plans heretofore proposed for an Authentic Publication, or for the Revision, of the Statutes.

No Complete and Authentic Edition of the Statutes has hitherto been undertaken by Authority j nor has the Design itself ever been suggested, simply, and without Connexion with other Schemes of Reformation or Improvement.

A general Revision of the Statute Law has been often wcommended from the Throne ; and has been petitioned for by both Houses of Parliament; It has engaged the Labours of successive Committees, and has been under.taken by Individuals sometimes with, and sometimes without, the Sanction of Royal or Parliamentary Authority ; but has never yet been carried forward to any Degree of Maturity.

In Queen ElizabethÕs Reign, A.D. 1557, Sir N. Bacon, Lord Keeper, drew up a short Plan for reducing, ordering, and printing the Statutes of the Realm. The following are the Heads of this Plan: 1 Ò First where many Lawes be made for one Thing, the same are to be reduced and established into one Lawe, and the former to be abrogated.ÑItem, where there is but one Lawe for one Thing, that these Lawes are to remain in Case as they be.ÑItem, that all the ACtes be digested into Titles, and printed according to the Abridgement of the Statutes.ÑItem, where Part of one A die standeth in force and another Part abrogated, there should be no more printed but that that standeth in force.ÑThe doing of these Things maie be committed to the Persons hereunder written, if it shall so please her MaÒ' and her Counsell, and Daye wolde be given to the Committees until the First Daie of Michaelmas Terme next coming for the doing of this, and then they are to declare their Doings to be considered of by such Persons as it shall please her Malie to appoint.Ó Then follow Lists of Twenty Committees of Four each, in which the Judges, Serjeants, Attorney and Solicitor General, &c. are named; One Judge, &c. and Three Counsel forming a Committee, to each of which it was proposed that a Title or Division of the Statute Law should be referred.

The SubjeCt was afterwards taken into Consideration, so far as related to the Penal Laws, at subsequent Periods in the Reign of the same Queen, viz. Anno 27, A.D.1585.1ÑAnno 35, A.D. 1593.3ÑAnno 39 & 40, A.D. 1597.*Ñ Anno 43, A.D. i6ot.* 5ÑIn the Proceedings in 1593 and 1597 Sir Francis Bacon took Part, and upon them he appears to have founded his Sketch, or Plan of a General Revisal of the Statute Law.6ÑKing James the First, upon his Accession to the Throne of England, 1603-4, and in subsequent Periods of his Reign, recommended also to Parliament a Reform of all the Statute Law, and of the Penal Laws in particular.7

In the Year 1610 a Digest and Repeal of the Penal Law was expressly stipulated for by the House of Commons, and acceded to by the House of Lords, in their joint Transadtion of the Great Contract with the Crown 8; and in the same Reign Sir Francis Bacon, Lord C. J. Hobart, Serjeant Finch, Mr. Noy, and others, by the KingÕs Command, made considerable Progress in the general Work of reforming and re-compiling the Statute Law, which Lord Bacon describes9 as ÒAn excellent Undertaking, of Honour to His MajestyÕs Times, and of good to all Times jÓ and recommends, in Imitation of the Statutes of 27 Hen. VIII. c. 15, and 3 & 4 Edw. VI. c. 11, for appointing Commissioners to examine and establish Ecclesiasucal Laws, that Commissioners be named by both Houses for this Purpose also, with Power not to conclude, but only to prepare and propound the Matter to Parliament.

In the British Museum is preserved a Manuscript Volume Ô¡ containing the Plan of an elaborate Report, particularising the several Statutes, from the Statute of Westminster the First, 3 Ed. I. to 7 Jac. I. 1609, then actually repealed or expired, and also the Statutes thought fit either to be absolutely repealed, or to be repealed and new Laws to be made in their Place. Possibly this may be the very Work spoken of by Sir Francis Bacon." It is drawn up as by Authority, with detailed Reasons for every proposed Measure; but it is not signed by, or addressed to, any one. A Table is subjoined to it, exhibiting the Result of the Report.

Among the Papers of Mr. Petyt, in the Inner Temple Library," is a Letter of Lord BaconÕs, dated 27th February 1608, which shews that he had the Advantage of using for his proposed Plan a Manuscript Collection of the Statutes, made with great Labour by Mr. Michael Heneage, Keeper of the Tower Records, in Five large Volumes, which it is feared has been lost. Lord BaconÕs Disgrace at the latter Period of the Reign of King James I. and the Distractions of the Government in what related to Parliament, were probably the Causes of the Failure of these Measures, and of the Silence that ensues respecting them in Parliamentary History.

During the Usurpation, the same Undertaking was resumed with Ardor. In 1650, a Committee was named, one of the Members whereof was Bulstrode Whitelock, then First Lord Commissioner for the Custody of the Great Seal: The Purpose was Ò to revise all former Statutes and Ordinances now in force, and consider as well which are fit to be continued, altered, or repealed, as how the same may be reduced into a compendious Way and exatt Method, for the more ease and clearer Understanding of the People.Ó And the Committee were empowered Ò to advise with the Judges, and to send for and to employ and call to their Assistance therein any other Persons whom they should think fit, for the better effe&ing thereof, and to prepare the same for the further Consideration of the House, and to make Report thereof.Ó ' But no such Report has been preserved.

In 1651-2, Matthew Hale Esquire, afterwards Lord Chief Justice Hale, Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, afterwards Lord Shaftesbury, and Rushworth the Author of the Historical Colledions, with other Persons out of the House, were appointed to report to the Committee their Opinions upon the Inconveniences of the Law; and a revised System of the Law was reported to the House in the Course of the same Year.1 The same Labour was afterwards transferred to other Hands, but the Work was not abandoned; and in 1653 a Committee was appointed to consider of a new Model or Body of the Law.3 But of this Committee no Proceedings are now discoverable.

After the Restoration, Finch, Solicitor General, afterwards Earl of Nottingham and Lord Chancellor, Serjeant Maynard, Sir Robert Atkins, Mr. Prynne, and others, were appointed in 1666, to be a Committee Ò to confer with such of the Lords, the Judges, and other Persons of the Long Robe, who have already taken Pains and made Progress in perusing the Statute Laws ; and to consider of repealing such former Statute Laws as they shall find necessary to be repealed; and of Expedients for reducing all Statute Laws of one Nature under such a Method and Head as may conduce to the more ready Understanding and better Execution of such Laws."3 This, however, was as ineffedual as any of the former Measures; and it is the last recorded Instance of the Interference of Parliament on the Subjeft, previous to those Proceedings which gave Rise to the Commissions under the Authority whereof the present Work has been executed.

The earliest Instance of the Exertions of any Individual, without the Sanffion of Parliamentary Authority, towards making a Collection of Statutes from authentic Sources, appears to have been afforded by Pulton.Ñ He was a learned Barrister, of great Age and Experience, and was employed for several Years in the Consideration of the Statute Law. He published two useful Books upon that Subjeft: first, an Abridgement of the Penal Statutes; and afterwards a Calendar or Abstract of all the Statutes in use, chronologically arranged ; together with an alphabetical Abridgement of them, in the Manner of RastallÕs Collection. He appears to have been encouraged and assisted in his first Work by Sir William Cordell, then Master of the Rolls, to whom it is dedicated ; various Editions of this were published from 1560 to 1577. His Calendar, first published about 1606, is distinguished by the following Expression in the Title Page ; viz. Ò Editum per mandatum Domini Regis.ÕÕ But nothing else, either in the Book or elsewhere, has been found to confer any Marks of Royal Authority upon the Contents of the Book. After the Publication of these Works, without any Public Patronage or Recommendation beyond a Permission to use the Records, he conceived the Plan of copying from their original Records, and printing for general Use, all the Statutes supposed to be in force.

This Plan it will be useful to state at Length : And this we are enabled to do by the Preservation of the Papers, containing his original Scheme, among Sir Robert CottonÕs Manuscripts in the British Museum.3 In one of these Papers the Design is set forth : It is indorsed, in a Hand frequent among the Cottonian Manuscripts, Ò Concerning Mr. PultonÕs Suiteand has no other Title, Mark, or Description at the Beginning or End ; though by another Article referring to it, there is Proof of its Date being in or previous to 1611. Ò Mr. Poulton seeketh to print the Statutes at Large. He promiseth to set down which Statutes or Parts of Statutes are repealed, and which, being at the first but temporary, are since expired and void, because not revived. This he hath already done in his late Abridgment, for which he had a Recompence of the Printer. Now, to make this new Book at large saleable, he promiseth to print the Statutes first in the Language the same were first written; and such as were originally in French or Latin, he will translate and print likewise in English. Where the Statute has no Title, he will devise a Title out of the Body, and print it with the Statute. He will set down which Statutes are warranted by the Record, and which not. He will correct the printed Book by the Record. For which Purpose he requireth free Access at all Times to the Records in the Tower. Being very aged, viz. almost Fourscore, he desireth that for his Ease and better enabling in his Work, the Keeper of the Records within the Tower of London may every Day deliver unto him, when he shall so require, One Parliament Roll, to be by him and his Clerk perused and viewed, in a Lodging which he hath taken near unto the said Office; the same afterwards to be redelivered by them to the said Keeper thereof. That the Clerk do help, further, and assist him in this Service by all the Means he can.Ó

Several Objections to the Prosecution of this Plan were made by Bowyer and Elsyng, Keepers of the Tower Records; among others, that they and their Predecessors had actually prepared Materials for the Work in question, and that they then had ready written Five Volumes of Statutes copied from the Records. These were perhaps the Volumes alluded to in Lord BaconÕs Letter before mentioned.' The Dispute between the Parties was continued for some Time :"But there remains among the Cottonian Manuscripts1 a Draught of an Award for its Determination by SirRobert Cotton himself, to whom they referred their Differences; and from a Paper in the British Museum, among the Manuscripts of Mr. Madox3, it appears, that an Order of Council passed on the 24th October 1611, granting Licence to Pulton to have the Use of the Records in the Manner asked. It recites that he undertook the Work by Persuasion of the Judges and others learned in the Laws, and requires the Keepers of the Records, on account of the Importance of the Work, and for the Benefit of the Learned, to assist and further him all they can.

Pulton lived to publish this proposed Edition in 1618; which is the Work already spoken of as PultonÕs English Statutes. In his Preface, after noticing the Redundancies of former Editions, containing Subsidy ACts and other ACts Ò expired, repealed, altered, and worn out of Use,Ó and his Intention to publish such only Ò which be now in Life, Force, and general Use,Ó he gives the following Statement of the Means he had employed in compiling his Collection.

Ò First, with as great Means, Care, and Industry, as possibly I could use, so many of the old Statutes here.tofore printed in the English Tongue, made and published in the Reigns of the first Ten Kings (accounting from 9 of Hen. III. unto 1 of Ric. III. inclusive), as be chiefly in Use and PraCtice, and which are the Foundation of Proceedings both legal and judicial, have been by me truly and sincerely examined by the original Records thereof remaining in the Tower of London ; and the Residue with the Register of Writs, being the most antient Book of the Law, the old and new Natura Brevium, the Books of Entries, the Books of Years, and Terms of the Law ; the best approved, printed, and written Books ; and by all such other Circumstances as might best give Probability of Truth unto the Learned. By reason whereof, the foresaid DefeCts, Imperfections, and Emblemishments being reformed in this Edition, as it is a Collection of the most usual Laws, gathered from out the grand Codex of all the Statutes, so it tnay serve as a Correction to the former Impressions.Ó

The DefeCts of PultonÕs Publication, as a general Collection of Statutes, are chiefly these : 1 st. As to the Statutes preceding Henry VII. it is a Translation in Englilh, and does not exhibit the Text in the original Language of the Records, as might have been expeCted from his Proposal : adly. Though it had the Permission, it had not the Authority of the King, by whom all ACts of Legislation are to be communicated to the Subject; and was only the private Work of an Individual for his own Benefit : 3dly. It is a partial Selection of such Statutes as in the Judge.ment of the Author, were fittest to appear in his Book ; their Authority and Use, whether in force or repealed, depending on his Opinion : 4thly. It is not, nor does it purport to be, a correCt and examined Copy from the Original Records, of all those ACls which are given at large; but of such only as the Author thought necessary so to examine and correCl: And it is left uncertain, which, and how many of them, were taken from printed or written Books. It has, therefore, though in a less Degree, the same Faults as all the Collections and Editions of Statutes printed before; and it was particularly unfortunate that the Author did not execute that Part of his Proposals which made their greatest Merit, namely, the giving an accurate Copy of the Original Text of the antient Statutes from the Record.

These Objections are no less applicable to the Editions by Hawkins and Cay, as falling short of the Character of a complete and authentic Collection of the Statutes. They professed indeed to have copied their Text from original Records, or other Manuscripts, in Latin and French ; but by printing some Statutes, and parts of Statutes, with the Translation, and some without it, and giving only a Translation of others, they have rendered their Editions liable to still further Objections, for which no subsequent Editor has hitherto attempted to offer a Remedy.

From the preceding Statement, the Necessity and Use of an Authentic Publication of the Statutes of the Realm will appear: for, although the DefeCts of all former Collections have been long complained of by learned and eminent Men, and although various Propositions have been offered at different Times, for an Authentic Publication of the Statutes, none such has yet been executed. At length, however, a SeleCt Committee, appointed by the House of Commons of Great Britain in the Year 1800, to enquire into the State of the Public Records of the Kingdom, having reported upon this Branch of the Matters referred to their Consideration, that in their Opinion, it was Ò highly expedient for the Honour of the Nation, and the Benefit of all His MajestyÕs SubjeCts, that a complete and authoritative Edition of all the Statutes should be published in pursuance of their Recommend.ation the present Work has been undertaken and executed ; under the Authority and Direction of Commissioners specially appointed by His Majesty to carry into Effect the several Measures which were by that Committee recommended to the Attention of Parliament.

39Edw. I. A.D. 1300-1.Õ

Magna Carta and Carta de Foresta, granted in the 9th Year of King Henry III. have, in every Colleflion of Statutes which contained the Statutes previous to 1 Edw. III. been printed as the first in Order. In all Editions previous to HawkinsÕs, they were printed as from Charters of Inspeximus of 28 Edw. I: By Hawkins and subsequent Editors they were printed from the Charter of Inspeximus entered on the Statute Roll of 25Edw.I: But in no Edition hitherto have they been printed immediately from any Charter of 9 Hen. Ill; and it is not known that any Statute Roll of that Date ever existed. In the present Colle&ton, these Charters are inserted according to their place in the above Series, and are printed from Charters under the Great Seal: They are also printed again amongst the Statutes 25 Edw. I. from the Entry on the Statute Roll of that Year, being the earliest Parliamentary Record upon which they have been found.

For the Purpose of examining all the Charters, and Authentic Copies and Entries thereof, and also of searching for antient Copies and Entries of Statutes, and Instruments not now to be found on the Statute Roll, Two Sub-Commissioners were employed during the Summer of 1806, in making a Progress through England and Ireland to every Place where it appeared from the Returns to the Record Committee of 1800, or from other Intelligence, that any such Charters, Copies, or Entries were preserved : And Searches have been made successively at every Cathedral in England which was known to possess any such Charters, Copies, or Entries; and also at the Univerfities of Oxford and Cambridge ; at Trinity College Dublin; at the Courts of Exchequer, and other Public Offices in Dublin ; and wherever else Information could be obtained on the Subjed. The Result, so far as relates to the Charters, may be thus briefly stated.

In Rochester Cathedral is preserved the Textui Roffensis : This is a Chartulary, or Collection of Charters and Instruments, compiled by Emulf, who was Bishop of Rochester from A.D. 1115 to A.D. 1125. In this Chartulary is an Entry of the Charter of Liberties, granted in the First Year of King Henry I. A. D. 1101 5.

In Exeter Cathedral is preserved an Original Charter granted in the First Year of King Stephen A. D. 1136.

Ô De libertatibus Ecclesie Anglie & Regni.Õ

In Canterbury Cathedral are several Chartularies or Registers of very antient Date. In these are entered the Charter of King Stephen, of which an Original is in Exeter Cathedral, and the Charter of King John, granted in the Sixteenth Year of his Reign, for free Elections of Prelates, &c. in Churches and Monasteries.

In Lincoln Cathedral, an Original of the Great Charter of Liberties, granted by King John in the Seventeenth Year of his Reign, is preserved in a perfed State. This Charter appears to be of superior Authority to either of the Two Charters of the same Date, preserved in the British Museum. From the contemporary Indorsements of the Word Lincolnia on Two Folds of the Charter, this may be presumed to be the Charter transmitted by the Hands of Hugh the then Bishop of Lincoln, who is one of the Bishops named in the Introdudory Clause ; and it is observable that several Words and Sentences are inserted in the Body of this Charter, which in both the Charters preserved in the British Museum, are added, by way of Notes for Amendment, at the Bottom of the Instrument.

In Durham Cathedral, several Charters of the Liberties of England are preserved with great Care; namely Magna Carta 12 Nov. 1 Hen. III.ÑCarta de Foresta 2 Hen. III.ÑMagna Carta and Carta de Foresta 9 Hen. III. The Carta de Foresta 2 Hen. III. is the earliest Charter of the Forest; the Original and all Authentic Records of which were supposed by Blackstone to be lost * *. It is remarkable that in this Original is inserted a Clause which occurs in an Entry of this Charter on a Roll, formerly belonging to the Abbey of Hales Owen in Shropshire, communicated to Blackstone by Lord Lyttelton Ô; and which is not inserted in the Carta de Foresta 9 Hen. III.

* It is not ascertained whether this Charter was granted in the First or Second Year of the Reign of Hen. III. See BlackstoneÕ] Charters, Introd. 410. pa. xxxviiiÑxl.: 8vo. pa. lixÑlxiii. A Manuscript, N0.70. in Benet College Library Cambridge, attributes this Charter positively to the first Year.

1 See more fully The Table prefixed to The Charters ; specifying the Original or Entry from which each Charter is respectively printed, and the Place where such Original or Entry is preserved.

1 Of this Charter two antient Copies are entered in the Red Book of the Exchequer at Westminster ; a Copy in MS. Cott. Claud. D. II. is comparatively modern and very incorreff.

A Charter of the Date of ta Nov. 1 Hen. III., was transmitted to Ireland ; and an Entry thereof is preserved in the Red Book of the Exchequer at Dublin.

In several other Cathedrals are Chartularies, Registers, or Colle&ions, of antient Date, containing Entries of the Great Charters and Charters of the Forest. The most valuable of these are at York, Gloucester, and Christ-Church, Dublin.

The Magna Carta of 9 Henry III. under Seal, from which Blackstone printed a Copy in his Edition of The Charters, and which he suggests was the Charter designed for the Use of the Knights or Military Tenants of Wiltshire, is still preserved by the Family of the Talbots, of Lacock Abbey, in that County.

In the Bodleian Library at Oxford are Magna Carta A. D. 1 a 17; and the Charters of Confirmation a 1 Henry III; and 39 Edward I.

In the British Museum is the Original of the Articuli Magne Carte under the Seal of King John, from which Blackstone printed the Copy in his Edition of the Charters. Two of the Great Charters of King John, one of 36th Henry III., and the Charter of Confirmation granted by King Edward I. at Ghent, in the 35th "Year of his Reign, are also preserved in the same Repository.

On the Statute Roll of 35 Edward I. are entered Charters of Inspeximus of that Date, reciting and confirming Magna Carta and Carta de Foresta of 9 Henry III. Entries of similar Charters dated a8 Ed. I. are made on the Charter Rolls of that Year; the only Difference between these several Charters of Inspeximus is that those of the 25th Year are tested by the KingÕs Son, and those of the 28th by the King himself. Original Charters of Inspeximus of these respective Dates, agreeing with the Entries on the Statute and Charter Rolls, are still in Existence. Of these Charters one of 25 Edw. I. confirming Magna Carta, is in the Town ClerkÕs Office London. Others of 28 Ed. I. confirming Magna Carta are in the same Repository, as also in Durham Cathedral, Weftminster Collegiate Church, Oriel College Oxford, and in the Town ClerkÕs Office at Appleby in Westmoreland. Others of the same Date, confirming Carta de Foresta, are in Durham Cathedral, and Oriel College Oxford.

From these Materials, and others previously obtained, Transcripts and Collations were made and accurately examined by the Sub-Commissioners. The Text of the several Charters inserted in the present Collection is printed from these Transcripts ; an attentive and strict Collation of the printed Text with the Transcript, has been made by one of the Sub-Commissioners, who himself assisted in making the Transcript, and in examining it with the Original; and where an engraved Copy has been made of any Charter, the printed Text has also been collated with such engraved Copy.

This Collection of Charters will be found to differ from BlackstoneÕs Edition of the Charters, and other printed Copies in the following Particulars : First, In exhibiting a complete Series of the Charters of Liberties, granted by the Kings of England; in which their Original and Progress may be traced until their final and complete Establish.ment in the Twenty-ninth Year of King Edward I.ÑSecondly, In affording in every Instance a faithful Transcript from Original Charters or Entries thereof; in Characters representing the Manuscript with its Contractions or Abbreviations,' so far as the same could be accomplished by Printing Types : Engraved Fac-Similes are also sub.joined, which have been made with great Care and Attention from several of the Charters, namely; the Charter of Liberties granted by Stephen, in Exeter Cathedral; the Articuli Magne Carte of John, in the British Museum ; the Magna Carta of John, in Lincoln Cathedral; the Carta de Foresta, 2 Hen. III. and the Magna Carta 9 Hen.III. in Durham Cathedral; the Entry of the Charter of Confirmation 21 Hen. Ill, on the Charter Roll of that Year in the Tower of London ; and the Charter of Inspeximus 25 Edw. I. in the Town ClerkÕs Office, London.ÑThirdly, In inserting the Stops or Points which Blackstone omitted, but which are justified by the Originals, and which are material to the Sense ; and in avoiding many Errors, which had crept into all prior Editions, even that of Blackstone himself, in consequence of the Transcripts and Examinations being intrusted, at different Places, to different Persons not all equally competent to the Task, and from the Collation of unauthenticated Manuscript Copies supposed to be of a Date much more antient than in Truth they are.1 Fourthly, In inserting Charters not before printed, viz. 1. The Charter of the Sixteenth Year of King John, for the free Eleftion of Prelates, &c. which is parti.cularly adverted to in the Magna Carta granted by that King : 2. TheFirst Charter of theForest, granted in the second Year of Henry III. now preserved inDurham Cathedral; the Existence of which escaped the Researches of Blackstone :

3. The Confirmation Charter of 36 Hen. Ill, which accounts for some Alterations in the Charters of Inspeximus and Confirmation of Magna Carta granted by Edward 1: 4. The Charter of Inspeximus and Confirmation of Magna

Carta 25 Edw. I. from the Original preserved in the Town ClerkÕs Office London ; being of the same Date as that entered on the Statute Roll: The Authenticity of this last mentioned Charter is evinced peculiarly by the Writ which is annexed to it; and no other such Original Charter of this Date is now known to exist: 5.

Sect. I.

Of the Matters inserted in this Collection of the Statutes; and their Arrangement.

1. All Instruments whatever, comprehended in any of the several ColleSions of Statutes printed previous to the Edition by Hawkins, are inserted in this Work; these having for a long Series of Years been referred to, and accepted as Statutes in Courts of Law : Together with these are inserted all Matters of a public Nature, purporting to be Statutes, first printed by Hawkins or any subsequent Editor ; and also New Matters of the like Nature, contained in any Statute Rolls, Inrollments of Afts, Exemplifications, Transcripts by Writ, and Original Adis, although not heretofore printed in any general Colledlion of Statutes. All these are placed in the Body of the Work as Text. But it is to be particularly observed, that any Decision upon the Degree of Authority to which any new Instrument may be entitled, as being a Statute or not, is entirely disclaimed.

At the Foot of the Text in each page, there are added, such Various Readings as appeared necessary to corredk its Errors, or to supply its Deficiencies;' or to reconcile any material Contradidlion or Repugnancy between the Text and the Translation; or between different Copies of the Text, where they were of equal of of nearly equal Authority. In the earlier Reigns, or in the Absence of any Authentic Source for the Text, such Various Readings are noted with much greater Freedom than in later Times, or where Authentic Sources exist. Writs and other Instruments, having diredt or material Reference to the several Statutes, are occasionally subjoined by way of Notes. These Various Readings and Instruments are taken from the following Sources: Inrollments of Adis; Exemplifications; Transcripts by Writ; Original Adis; Rolls of Parliament; Close, Patent, Fine, and Charter Rolls; Books containing Entries of Record; Antient Books and Manuscripts not of Record, but preserved in the Repositories of Courts of Justice, and Corporation Offices; or in the Libraries of Cathedrals, Universities, Colleges, or Inns of Court, and at the British Museum: Various Readings have been also admitted from the Printed Editions; occasionally in Confirmation of the Manuscript Sources, and more frequently in Cases where those Sources have been found deficient.

Every Thing heretofore printed in any former Colledlion of Statutes, is in this Volume printed in an uniform Type; and all new Matters, whether Various Readings, Notes, or entire Statutes or Instruments, are distinguished by a smaller Type. The entire Matters whether old or new, of which the Dates are ascertained, are piaced in Chronological Order ; and all, during the Reigns of Hen. III. Edw. I. and Edw. II., the Dates of which are uncertain, are classed together, after the Manner of former Editions, at the End of the Reign of Edward II.

A compleat Enumeration of all Matters included in this Colledlion, whether as Text or in the Notes, is exhibited in a general Chronological Table of Contents prefixed to the Body of the Statutes ; specifying the Source or Authority, from whence the Text, Notes, and Various Readings are respedlively taken.

2. Other Matters of a Parliamentary Form and Charadler have been recognized at different Periods of our History, as appearing to have Legislative Authority. It has been observed by Lord Coke, that Ò Acts of Parlia.ment are many times in form of Charters or Letters Patent;Ó1 and many such have been inserted in all Editions of the Statutes : and that there are Ò many Adis of Parliament that be in the Rolls of Parliament and never yet printed :ÓJ In the Report also of the Seiedt Committee of the House of Commons, in the Year 1800, upon the Subjedl of the Public Records, it is stated, that many Statutes and Ordinances in the Rolls of Parliament are not inserted in the Printed Statute Books; And it is certain that many Adis and Matters not found on any Statute Roll, nor contained in any printed Editions of the Statutes, are found on the Parliament Rolls, which appear to have received the threefold Assent of King, Lords, and Commons, or to have such Qualities, as have been allowed by Courts of I,aw to imply that Assent.*

With a View therefore to a Consideration of the Question, whether Matters of this Nature should be compre.hended in the present Work, Lists of a great Number of them were prepared, not only from the Parliament

1 Many Instances of Enrors and Deficiencies exist even in the Statute Roll; it may be sufficient to quote ihe Clause in Chapter 5, of the Statute Westminster the Second, respedling Damages in Writs of Darrein Presentment and Quarc Impedit t In this Clause, the Words which give the Patron damages to the Amount of Two Years Value of the Church, jn case of lapse to the Bishop, by reason of the disturbance of the Presentation, are omitted on the Roll. In Chapter 28 of the same Statute, the Statute of Gloucester is quoted instead of the Statute of Westminster the First. See pa. 77, note 6Ñ8 ; and page 85, note j of the Statutes in this Volume.

Rolls, but also from other Records, particularly the Close Rolls and Patent Rolls, which were examined for the Purpose with great Care and Diligence, and Transcripts and Collations of many of them were made for the Examination of the Commissioners. In the Progress of this Labour, however, it appeared that the Matters which came within the Description above mentioned, were so numerous, that the indiscriminate Insertion of all of them would constitute a Mass, the very Bulk of which would prove inconvenient. But, what was of still greater Importance, upon Examination it became with respefl to many of them, a Subject of Discussion, from which no certain Conclusion could be derived, to what Extent they had in fail received Sanction, and whether therefore they were, in any Degree, entitled to be considered as of Legislative Authority.' It was obvious, at the same Time, that to have made a Selection only of such Matters as in the Opinion of the Commissioners were the least doubtful, was in Effect encountering the same Difficulty only in a smaller Degree; and the Sources, from which they were to be taken, not being in themselves conclusive Evidence,* that the Matters contained in them were Statutes, the Selection in each Instance necessarily could be nothing more than the Result of private Judgment; without the Authority of that Ò general received Tradition,Ó which, as Lord Hale observes,1 attests and approves those Statutes which are not properly extant of Record.

Atts also which received the Royal Assent, and which were entered only on the Parliament Roll, and not on the Statute Roll, have been frequently termed Ordinances ; and various Distindfions have ineffe&ually been attempted to be made between an Ordinance and a Statute, with regard to the Nature and Validity of each respe&ively :4 But whatever has at any Time been written on this Subjedf is contradictory and indistinct ; and in the Reign of Charles I, the Information on this Point, then of some Importance, appears to have been very unsatisfactory.5

See State Trials, Vol. VI. 760. the Earl of MacclesfieldÕs Case ; and 3 Inst. 146, 224, 225, where this Entry is printed at length, and considered by Lord Coke as an Adi of Parliament. See also the Argument on the Jurisdidlion of Chancery annexed to Vol. I. of Reports of Cases in Chancery, where the necessity and propriety of consulting the Petition and Answer, or the Entry thereof on the Parliament Roll, as the Warrant for the Statute Roll, is much insisted on, upon the Authority of Sir Francis Bacon, and other eminent Lawyers ; with Reference to the Statute 4 Hen.

It is observable also, that the Statute 23 Edw. III. * pro hiis qui nati sunt in partibus transmarinis Õ pa. 310 of the Statutes in this Volume, is in the Old Abridgements called Ô Statutum perse:Õ and that in those Abridgements, Title ' Excommengement,Õ reference is made to an Instrument cited in the earlier Editions as of 9 Ed. III. and in later Editions, as of 8 Edw. 111. called Ô Ordinatio per se Õ whereby Writs were ordained for excommu.nicating disturbers of the Peace of the Church and the Realm. In the later Editions, it is alleged that such Writs were framed on a Statute 5 Ed. Ill st. 2. c. 1.: Rastall in the early Editions of his Collection, quoting these Abridgements, adds, Ò But I cannot find anie of these Statutes.Ó See further Rot. Pari. 35 Edw. 1: 5 Edw. II: 14 Edw.

No. 244. mentioned in Page xxvi of this Introduction, the Instrument intituled Articuli de Moneta, usually ascribed to 20 Edw. I. is considered as a Proclamation not as a Statute ; and this and some other Instruments classed among the antient Statutes are reported therein as fit to be repealed, on account of the uncertainty of their Validity as Statutes.

J In the British Museum are Two Copies, Donation Manuscripts, ^4489 and 5668, of a Manuscript Treatise entitled * Expeditions Billarum Antiquitas,Õ drawn up apparently by Elsyng, who was Deputy Clerk of the Parliaments in 1620, and for several Years afterwards. See also MSS. Harl. 303, 4273, 6583. This Work professes to give an historical Account of the antient Mode of passing Bills in Parliament: It appears from internal Evidence to have been written between 1628 and 1640, and to have been designed as a Second Part of the Treatise on Parliaments. It is vouched throughout by reference to original Petitions and Rolls of Parliament, from 4 Edward III. the earliest known to the Writer to exist, to 27 Hen. VI. In th^ Treatise, the Form and Validity of Ordinances, as distinguished from Statutes, are stated much at length ; and amongst other Things it is asserted that an Ordinance cannot make Neto or Permanent Law, nor repeal any Statute, but that temporary Provisions, consistent with the Law in force, may be made by way of Ordinance; and that an Ordinance may be repealed by a subsequent Ordinance without Statute. See Rot. Pari. 21 Edw. III. nu.13, 47, 32 ; 22 Edw. III. nu. 20, 21 ; 37 Edw. III. P. 1. nu. 37, 38, 39 ; 45 Edw. III. nu. 24, 25, 37, 40 ; that the King did forbear to grant those Petitions which demanded Novel Ley, when he had no Intent to make a Statute. See also Rot. Pari. 22 Edw. III. nu. 30, that the Laws had and used in Times past could not be changed without making thereon a New Statute: and see Rot. Pari. 11 Hen. IV. nu.63, 13 Hen. IV. nu. 49, that Ordinances of Parliament which introduced Novel Ley were not of any Force. In the Parliament 37 Edw. III. it was precisely demanded by the Chancellor, whether the Matters then agreed on, being new and not before known or used, should be granted bv way of Ordinance or Statute, and that of Ordinance was preferred by the Parliament, for the Purpose that if any Thing were to be amended it might be amended at the next Parliament: The Ordinance was accordingly entered on the Back of the Parliament Roll, and was termed an Ordinance in the subsequent Parliament. It is very remarkable, however, that this Ordinance is also entered on the Statute Roll, and has always been received as a Statute of this Year; that Penalties inflicted by former

From these Considerations therefore, upon mature Deliberation, it has been deemed advisable that this Collection should include all such Instruments as have been inserted in any general Collection of Statutes printed previously to the Edition by Hawkins; with the Addition, only of such Matters of a public Nature, purporting to be Statutes, as were first introduced by him or subsequent Editors, and of such other New Matters of the like Nature, as could be taken from Sources of Authority not to be controverted ; namely, Statute Rolls; Inrollments of ACts, Exemplifications, Transcripts by Writ, and Original ACb.

In the 31st Year of Henry VIII. rile Distinction between Public Acts and Private Acts is for the first Time specifically stated on the IrrroIIment in Chancery.' No Private ACts passed after that Date have been admitted into this Collection: It has been thought sufficient to notice them, by the Insertion of their Titles only.

Sect. II.

Of the Sources from whence the several Matters have been taken.

I. The Sources from which the Materials have been taken for this Collection, are necessarily of a different Character and Description in different Periods of our History.

The earliest Statutes contained in the several Collections are those of Henry III; but no Parliamentary Record of Statutes is now known to be extant, prior to the Statute Roll 6 Kdw. I. To this interval nevertheless belong the Statutes of Merton, Marlborough, Westminster the First, and several others, always included in the Printed Editions. For this early Period, therefore, Recourse must be had to inferior Sources for the Text of our Statute Law : And even in subsequent Times, there is not only an Interruption in the Series of Statute Rolls, namely, after 8 Hen. VI, until 23 Hen. VI, inclusive, during which the like Recourse must be had to Sources of an inferior Degree of Authority ; but the Statute Rolls themselves do not, within their own Period, contain all the bistruments which have been acknowledged as Statutes. After 8 Edw. IV. the Statute Roll is not preserved ; after 4 Henry

VII. it ceased to be made up ; and ultimately it was succeeded, for practical Purposes, by the Inrollment in Chan.cery ;1 though during a short Period the Statute Roll and the Inrollment appear to have been contemporary.

The Materials for the several Periods during which no Statute Rolls or Parliamentary Records exist, can only be collected from Records, on which Copies or Extracts of Statutes have been entered ; or from other Manu.scripts not of Record ; or, in Default of other Authority, from the oldest Printed Editions in which such Matters were first inserted. With respeft to Entries of Record, in these Periods, That has been judged to be the most authentic Evidence of a Statute, which has been preserved as a Record or authentic Copy from antient Times, in the Custody of the highest Courts authorized for that Purpose. Such are Copies or Extracts of particular Statutes found in the Close, Patent, Fine, and Charter Rolls, being Records of Chancery. Such also are the Red Books of the Exchequer of Westminster, and Dublin. On Failure of these Records, Recourse has, of Necessity, been had to Manuscripts not of Record, preserved in the Custody of Courts of Justice, Public Libraries, or other Public Repositories. Such are some antient Books of Statutes in the Exchequer at Westminster, in the Town ClerkÕs Office, London, in the several Cathedrals, in the Public and other Libraries of the several Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin, and in the British Museum : When all these Sources have proved deficient, and in such Case only, a Copy has been admitted, from the oldest Printed Edition, with Various Readings from subsequent Printed Editions.

During the Periods in which Statute Rolls or other Parliamentary Records do aftually exisr, the Authentic Evidence of Statutes, (and of other Proceedings in Parliament, before the Commencement of the Journals,) must be searched for upon Statute Rolls ; Inrollments of Ads; Exemplifications of such Statute Rolls or Inrollments ; Transcripts by Writ into Chancery for the Purpose of such Exemplifications; Original Acts ; and Rolls of Parliament.ÑThese are the only Authentic Sources from whence, during those Periods, a Knowledge can be obtained of the different Occurrences in Parliament, whether important or minute. With the Exception of some Rolls containing Proceedings in Parliament from 18 to 35 Edw. I, which are in the Chapter House at Westminster,

Statutes were repealed by it; and that Words of Enaftment for Statute are expressly used therein. See Rot. Pari. 37 Edw. III. Part 1. nu. 38, 39 : 38 Edw. III. nu.i 1 : 1 Ric. II. nu. 1 j : Rot.Stat. 37 Edw.III. m. 5, 6 : 38 Edw. III. m. 6 d : Chapters 16 and 19 of the Statute 37 Edw. Ill; and Chapter 2 of Stat. 38 Edw. III. Stat. 1. as printed in pages 378, 38a, 383, of the Statutes in this Volume : and further, Rot. Pari. 38 Edw. III. nu. 9, and the Ordinances there recited, which were entered on the Statute Roll, and are primed as a Statute of that Year in all Editions, and in page 385 of this Volume. See also Prynne's Irenarchus Redivivus, p. 27, &c. in which, contrary to Lord CokeÕs Authority, 4 Inst. 2j, he lays it down that Ordinances and Afts of Parliament were one and the same.

In ClarendonÕs History of the Rebellion sub. an. 1641-2, Vol. I. Part. II. page 431. ^8¡ Edit. Oxford 1707.) it is stated that Ò An Ordinance for settling the Militia was agreed on by both Houses, and sent to the King for his Approbation.ÓÑThe Form of

the Ordinance follows : It is entitled, Ò An Ordinance of both Houses of Parliament for the ordering of the Militia,Ó 8cc__

After a short Preamble the formal Words are, Ò It is ordained by the King the Lords and Commons now in Parliament assembled, That,Ó 8tc.ÑIn the first answer which the King sent, he said " that to avoid all future doubts and questions, he desired it might be digested into an Aft of Parliament rather than an Ordinance ; so that all his Subjefts might thereby particularly know, both what they were to do and what they were to suffer for their neglect.Ó pa. 437,8.Ñ Afterwards the King in answer to a Petition presented ay the Commons says, Ò For the Militia - - - - we never denied the thing - - - we only denied the way. You ask. it by way of Ordinance - - - we tell you we would have the thing done - - - but desire a Bill, the only good old way of imposing on our Subjefts. We are extremely unsatisfied what an Ordinance 11, but well satisfied that without our Consent it is nothing nor binding.Ó pa. 70.ÑA Bill was afterwards prepared by .he KingÕs Order, and submitted to both Houses,

who made several Alterations in it__In the KingÕs Message, refusing the Royal Assent to the Bill so altered, his Majesty told

them Ò he was pleased they had declined the unwarrantable course of their Ordinance, to the which he was confident his good Subjefts would never have yielded their Consent, and chosen that only right way of imposing upon the People.Ó pa. 503. In the KingÕs Declaration in answer to that made by the two Houses, whereby they assumed the Power of the Militia, Ò He said it was true chat he had, out of tenderness of the Constitution of the Kingdom, and care of the Law, which l e was bound to defend, and being most assured of the unjustifiabler.ess of the pretended Ordinance, invited and desired borh Houses of Parliament to settle whatsoever should be fit of that Nature by Aft of Parliament.Ó pa. 524.

such of the Original Statute Rolls, Inrolltnents of Acts, and Parliament Rolls, as are still preserved, are deposited in the Tower of London,Õ or at the Chapel of the Rolls,1 * * Places appropriated to the Custody of the Records of the King's Chancery, which has ever been deemed the proper Repository of the Statutes of the Kingdom.

II. The Nature and Qualities of the several Records and Manuscripts from whence all the Statutes, as well those of an earlier as of a later Period, have been taken for Insertion or Collation in this Work, and the Place where each original Record and Manuscript is kept, will more fully appear from the following Detail.

i. Statute Rolls.ÑThese are Records of Chancery, of the highest Authority, on which were entered the several Statutes when drawn up in Form; for the Purpose of being proclaimed and published ; these Statutes being framed upon such Original Petitions and Answers, or Entries thereof on the Parliament Rolls, as related to Public Concerns.Õ The earliest Statute Roll now known to exist, is that which commences with The Statute of Gloucester 6 Edw. I. A.D. 1278. From that Period to 8 Edw.IV. inclusive, A.D. 1468,.with an Interruption, after 8 Hen.VI. until 23 Hen. VI. inclusive, the Statutes are preserved in the Tower of London in a regular Series, on Six separate Rolls, each Roll consisting of several Membranes tacked together. The Contents of each Roll are as follows, viz.

Of the Great Roll; Statutes from 6 Edw. I. to 50 Edw. III. But this Roll does not contain all the Statutes which have been printed as of that Period.4 *

Second Roll; Statutes Temp. Ric. II. There is also a separate Roll, of one Membrane, containing a Duplicate of the Statutes 21 Ric. II.

Third Roll; Statutes Temp. Hen. IV. and V.

Fourth Roll; Statutes 1 Hen. VI. to 8 Hen. VI.

Fifth Roll; Statutes 25 Hen. VI. to 39 Hen. VI.

Sixth Roll; Statutes 1 Edw. IV. to 8 Edw. IV. This is the last Statute Roll now known to exist, none of a later Date having been found.

These have ever had the Reputation annexed to them of being Statute Rolls. Some of them are cited by that Name upon the Close and Patent Rollsand referred to by great Law Writers, Lord Coke, Lord Hale,6 and

1 With reaped! to the depositing the Records of Chancery in the Tower, see Rot. Pat. 9 Eliz. Part 6, on which is recorded a Precept from the Queen dated 1 May, which passed under the Great Seal, to Francis Spilman Esq. Clerk of the Parliaments requiring him to remove all Rolls of Parliament, Petitions, Judgements, Attainders, and other Records of Parliament in his Custody from 22 Edw. IV. to l Mary, into the Tower, to be delivered to William Bowyer the Keeper of the Records there : On Part 9 of the Patent Roll of the same Year is recorded a Precept under the Sign Manual, dated 18 June, to Sir William Cordell, Master of the Rolls, for the like Removal of the Parliament Rolls, Patent Rolls, Charter Rolls, Close Rolls, Fine Rolls, and all other Rolls and Records of Chancery for the same Period. In LelandÕs Colledtanea (Edit. 1770.) Vol. 2. p. 656, is the Copy of a Warrant of Q. Elizabeth, without Date, requiring a like Removal of the Records of the Chancery ; Which Warrant is introduced by the following Recital: Ò Forasmuch, as it is not meet that the Records of our Chancery being accompted as a prin.cipal! Membre of the Threasure belonging to ourself, to our Corone and Realme, should remain in private Places and Houses, for doute of such Danger or Spoile as heretofore hath happened to the like Recordes in the Time of King Richard the Second, and King Henry the Sixth our PTOgenitours ; but rather to remain in our Towre of London, under the Custody of the Keeper of our Recordes there for the Time being, as not only by due Custome of our Progenitors from Time to Time used may appeare, for that (as wee are informed) all the Records of our said Chancery from the Time of our Progenitour William the Conqueror until the last Year of the Reign of King Edward the Fourth our Progenitour, have been from Time to Time thereunto brought, and now there at this Time doe remain ; But also (as wee are informed) the same is by Recorde manifeste and apparante.Ó The Parliament Rolls, however, as also the Close, Patent, Fine, and Charter Rolls, from the Time of Ric. III. still remain in the Chapel of the Rolls; but many Bundles of Bills, Answers, Depositions, and other Proceedings in Chancery have, at the Instance of the Six Clerks, been from time to time removed from their Record Room to the Tower; and Examinations taken by the Examiners of the said Court have, at their Instance, been also removed to the Tower.

Master of the Rolls, and the Confirmation thereof, by Ric. II, see Rot.Pat. 51 Edw.III. m.20: 6 Ric. II. Part 3, m. 12.

* Lord Hale, H. C. L. ch. r. says this Roll Òbegins with Magna Carta and ends with Edw. III.Ó This is erroneous; for though part of the Roll antecedent to 6 Edw. I. may have been lost since the time of Lord Hale, there is no reason to con.clude that it ever began with Magna Carta : Magna Carta and Carta deForesta are not entered on this Roll prior to 25 Edw. I. and they are accordingly printed as Statutes of that Year in this Collcdtion. There are not wanting Authorities which seem to consider the Great Charter, as possessing the Validity of a Statute from the 1st or the 9th of Henry III.; before the Con.firmation of it by the Statute of Marlborough, 52 Henry III. It is so considered by Coke in 2 Inst, dy, 1 Inst. 43 a, 81 a ; in the Prince's Case, 8 Rep. 19; and elsewhere: by Hale H.C.L. ch. 1 ; and by Blackstone in his Introduction to the Charters, 4to. pa. xl. 8vo. pa. Ixi.: It is also expressly called a Statute by Littleton, sedl. 108 ; but this may be referable to its subsequent Confirmation by Parliament. HaleÕs Idea may probably have arisen from supposing it to be on the Statute Roll before

6 Edw. I. And Coke and Blackstone founded their Opinions chiefly upon two judicial decisions cited from FitzherbertÕs Abridge.ment; (Part 2, fo. 120 b. tit. Mordaunc. pi. 23, and Part 1, fo. 188 a. tit. Briefe pi. 881 ;) the one as of 5 Hen. III. the other as of 21 Hen. Ill; to which may be added another of 23 Hen. III. Fitz. Abr. Part 1, fo. 90 a. tit. Assbe. pi. 436. These, if of those Years respectively, certainly prove that the Great Charter was then considered as the Law of the Land, but not, absolutely, that it was previously of Parliamentary EnaClment. In the Instances of 5 Hen. III. and 23 Hen. Ill, the Phrase Ò lestatut de Magna CartaÓ is merely used incidentally by Fitzherbert in stating the Points adjudged ; and there is some ground to think also that the former decision was possibly of a much later Period ; See the Year Books 38 Hen. VI. 18. and 39 Hen. VI. 19 : In the Instance of 21 Hen. III. the Great Charter is referred to, not as a Parliamentary AC1, but as a Grant, Ô concessumÕ being the Word used to denote its Authority : which Construction, the Preamble of the Artlculi super Carlas, Stat. 28 Edw. I, and the Beginning of Chapter 1. of that Statute, confirm; though in the Confirmatio Cartarum, Stat. 25 Edw.I. c. 1. which passed during the Absence of the King from the Realm, it is recited of the two Charters Ò les queles furent faites p comun assent de tut le Roiaume.ÓÑIn an Admiralty Record, quoted by Prynne (Animad. 120,) as of 23 Hen. VI, the Laws of Oleron are recognised by the Term Ò Statutum.Ó

e

the Editors of Statutes, Pulton, Hawkins, Cay, &c. There is Evidence also that Statute Rolls have existed of a subsequent Time ; for the Statutes after 8 Edward IV, until 4 Henry VII. inclusive, are inserted in the early Printed Editions in a Form manifestly copied from complete Statute Rolls; and they are found in the like Form in Lib. XI. in the Exchequer at Westminster, MS. Cott. Nero C. I, in the British Museum, and in several other Manuscript Colleftions. But there is reason to conclude, that the making up of the Statute Roll entirely ceased with the Session 4 Hen. VII, as no such Roll of a later Date, nor any Evidence thereof has been discovered ; and it is observable that in the next Session, 7 Hen. VII, Public A£ls were, for the first time, printed from the several Bills passed in Parliament, and not as part of one general Statute drawn up in the antient Form.

2. Inroilments of Afts of Parliament.ÑThese are Records, containing the Afts of Parliament certified and delivered into Chancery. They are preserved in the Chapel of the Rolls, in an uninterrupted Series from

1 Ric. III. to the present Time; except only during the Usurpation. By the Officers of Chancery they are commonly termed Ò Parliament Rolls and they are variously endorsed, some with the Phrase Ò inroilments of Acts.Ó' From 1 Ric. III. to 3 Car. I. inclusive, they comprehend several other Proceedings of Parliament besides the A&s inrolled ; (sometimes for Instance, the Commissions for giving the Royal Assent to Bills are found entered on them ; *) thus partaking of the Qualities of Rolls of Parliament, and including nearly the same Contents : until, the miscellaneous Matters disappearing by Degrees, the Acts inrolled only occur : After 5 Hen. VII. they may be considered in Effect, as coming in the Place of the Statute Roll.1 To 25 Hen. VIII. they contain all AQs, Public and Private, which were passed in every Session, each with an introductory and concluding Form of their being presented and assented to : From 25 Hen. VIII, to 35 Eliz. several of the Private A its, and afterwards to 3 Car. I. all the Private Adis, are omitted, their Titles only being noticed. From 16 Car. I. to 31 George II. the Inroilments contain nothing but the Public Adts, and the Titles of the Private Adts, with the several Forms of Assent, without any other Parliamentary Matter. And from 32 George II. their Contents are the same, with the Omission of the Titles of the Private Adts.

At present, after all the Public-General Adts of the Session have received the Royal Assent, a Transcript of the Whole is certified by the Clerk of the Parliaments, and deposited in the Rolls Chapel: On that Occasion the Clerk of the Parliaments sends the Roll, or Rolls, containing such Transcript, apparently . in a complete State, engrossed on Parchment, signed, and certified by him as Clerk of the Parliaments ; and it is thereupon arranged with the other Records ; and thus becomes the Inrollment of the Statutes of that Session of Parliament. For this Transcript the Clerk of the Parliaments is paid every Session out of the Hanaper, on a Receipt by the Clerk of the Records in the Rolls Chapel, stating that the Roll is delivered there.

It may be further observed upon this SubjedI, that the Proceedings which took Place in the House of Lords in Ireland in 1758,4 for the better Preservation of the Records of Parliament in that Kingdom, where the Constitution and Law of Parliament were in all essential Points conformable to those of England, afford a strong Illustration of the Pradtice of certifying Statutes and recording them in Chancery.1

1 No Notice is taken, at the present Day, on the Inrollment of Acts in Chancery, of any Commission by which Acts are passed : It is believed that no Instance of the Entry of any such Commission on that Inrollment has occurred since the Time of Charles I. See in Appendix F. subjoined to this Introduction, a further Account of these Inroilments, and a Copy of the earliest Commission for giving the Royal Assent. 5 See ante page xxxiii. and Appendix E. subjoined to this Introduction.

1 The following Minute respecting the Mode of framing Statutes is extracted from the Treatise intituled, ¥ Expeditions Billarum AntiquitasÕ quoted in Page xxxii, Note 5.

The Statute was made by the King and a Council of Judges and others, who were called to assist herein.ÑÒ the usual Time for making a Statute was after the end of every Parliament; and after the Parliament Roll was engrossed, except on some extraordinary Occasions.ÓÑÒ The Statute was drawn out of the Petition and Answer, and penned in the form of a Law, into several Chapters, or Articles, as they were originally termed.ÓÑÒ The Statute being thus drawn up into divers Heads or Articles, now called Chapters, it was shewn to the King; and upon his MajestyÕs Approbation thereof, it was engrossed (some.times with a Preamble to it, and a Clause of ¥ Observari VolumusÕ at the Conclusion, and sometimes without any Preamble at all,) and then by Writs sent into every County to be proclaimed.Ó See Rot. Pari. 14 Edw. III. nu. 7 : 15 Edw. III. nu. 42 : 17 Edw. III. nu. 19, 23 : 18 Edw. III. nu. 12, 23, 24 : 22 Edw. III. nu. 4, 30: 25 Edw. III. m. 5. nu. 12, 13; m. 4. nu. 43 : 27 Edw.

Ò Many Inconveniencies happened to the Subject by the antient Form, in framing and publishing of the Statutes, viz. Sometimes no Statute hath been made, though agreed on ; many Things have been omitted ; many Things have been adetrd in the Statute; a Statute hath been made, to which the Commons did not assent, and even to which neither Lords por Commons assented." See 1 HaleP.C. 394; 3 Inst. 40,41 j 12 Rep. 57; Rot. Pari. 18 Edw.III. nu.32Ñ39:3 Ric.II. nu.38:6 Ric. II. nu. 53.

As to the inrolling of the Statute in Chancery, See Rot. Claus. 12 Edw. II. m. 22 d. where the Proceeding is thus explicitly stated. Ò Le Roi voet & g*unt - - - q tutes les choses desusescrites soient enroullez en roulle de parlement, 8c de illoesqs envoie en sa Chauncellerie, 8c illuesqs enroullez, 8c de illusqes per bref de son g*nt seal envoiez a les places del Escheker 8c de lun Baunk 8c del autre, od comandement de enrouller les illoeqs 8c a tenir les Sc a garder en la fourme avantdite.Ó

And in conformity with this proceeding, Statutes made in England and required to be proclaimed and observed in Ireland, were sent to the Chancellor there, to be inrolled in the Chancery of that Kingdom, and thence exemplified and sent to the Courts of Justice, 8cc.ÑSee Stat. 12 Edw. II. and the Writs at the End thereof, page 179, of the Statutes in this Volume ; and

3. Exemplifications; and Transcripts by Writ.ÑExemplifications are Copies sent out of Chancery under the KingÕs Seal; either to Sheriffs of Counties and Cities in England, or to the Chancellor or Chief Justice of Ireland, or to other Courts or Places, for the safe Custody and for the proclaiming or confirming of the Statute; or in other Cases for affording Authentic Evidence of the Statute. In the Tower of London, Copies of the Statutes 9, to, 11, 14, 15, 18 and 20 Hen.VI. (for some Years to the Number of two, three, six, or seven Copies) are preserved on separate Skins of Parchment, which appear to have been prepared as Exemplifications, for the Purpose of proclaiming the several Statutes; and these serve to supply the Deficiency of the Statute Roll during that Period. One similar Copy of the Statutes 13 Ric. II. is also preserved in the Tower.1

It is not irrelevant to remark, that an Exemplification differs from an Original Grant under the Great Seal, or an Original Adi of Parliament, in this; that an Exemplification is a Copy, and can be made only from the Record.1 At the present Day every Exemplification, being first made out in Form by the proper Officer, is examined with the Record by two Masters in Chancery, who not only subscribe a Certificate on the Exempli.fication, of their having examined it with the Record, but also sign a Certificate to that effedt, addressed to the Lord Chancellor, on a Paper called the Docket, which is left with him before the Exemplification is allowed to pass the Great Seal.

Transcripts by Writ were Copies sent into Chancery in Answer to the KingÕs Writ or Mandate, calling for a Copy of the Statute from the Officer in whose Custody it was preserved. A Transcript of the Statutes of Wales 12 Edw. 1. is preserved in the Tower of London, with the Writ annexed, by which that Transcript was required from the Exchequer at Westminster ;3 where it was entered of Record, according to the Usage which formerly prevailed of sometimes inrolling Statutes in Courts of Justice.4 Transcripts and Exemplifications of Statutes have also been occasionally found in various other Repositories.5

for other Instances illustrative of thus inrolling Statutes in Chancery in England and Ireland, See Appendix E. subjoined to this Introduction.

The Distinction between such Bills as were common and such as were particular, or in the more modem Phrase Public Adis and Private Adl3, with respedl to the Pradlice of inrolling them, was thus certified by Kirltby of the Rolls,33 Hen.VI. Ò Sir, le cours del parlemt est tiel - - - - si ascun bill, soit pticuler, ou au? bill cj soit primeTmt delivf a les Comus, et

In the 14th Year of James I. Lord Hobart speaking of a Private Adi then under Consideration said, Ò That very Bill is filed with the rest of the Bills, and the KingÕs Assent unto it, and labelled with the rest, whereunto the Great Seal is set, as the Course is in Private Adis, which are not inrolled without special Suit, as General Adis are ; for General Adis are always inrolled by the Clerk of the Parliament, and delivered over into Chancery, which Inrollment in the Chancery makes them the Original Record (as it was resolved in John StubbsÕs Case) : But in Private Adis the very Body of the first Bill filed and sealed as aforesaid, and remaining with the Clerk of the Parliament, is the Original Record." Hob. 109. The following Account, given also in the Reign of James I. by Bowyer and Elsyng, in the written Objections which they made to PultonÕs having Access to and printing the Original Records of Acts in the Tower (See Chap. I. Sect. II. pa. xxviii. of this Introduction,) appears to be more accurate with respedl to private Adis than that of Lord Hobart; and agrees with that given by Kirkby in 33 Hen.VI. ÇÇ At the End of every Session of Parliament, all the Public Acts are ingrossed into one great Roll by Bowyer, as Clerk of the Parliament; and the same Roll, being by him subscribed, he delivereth into the Chapel of the Rolls ; which is thereupon there received, and placed among the Records of the Chancery, being the highest Record of the Kingdom, without any other Warrant than his Hand : Which Acts or Statutes so by him transcribed, do bind his MajestyÕs Subjects of all Degrees for ever. If any Private Act be at any Time to be certified into the Chancery, a Writ of Certiorari is directed to Bowyer, who thereupon doth certify the same under his Hand ; which accordingly is received, without any Allowance or Warrant of any other Person, and is thereby made a Record, and bindeth the Party whom it concemeth, and all others.Ó MS. Cott. Titus B.V. pa. 69. See further Hale H. C. L. ch. 1., 3 Keb. Rep. 587 j DewesÕs Journals of Parliament, 1 Eliz. pa- 35 i and the Instances in Appendix E, and F. subjoined to this Introduction.

All the Statutes passed in each Session are now classed in Three distinct Series : The first Series contains the Public-General Acts, such as in their Nature are Public and General, which are certified into Chancery, and printed by the KingÕs PrinteT for general Circulation : The Second Series contains Acts respecting particular Places and Persons: Of these the Road Acts, Canal Acts, and all others by which Felonies are created, Penalties inflicted, or Tolls imposed, have a Clause annexed to each Ò That the Act shall be deemed and taken to be a Public Act, and shall be judicially taken Notice of as such by all Judges, Justices and others, without being specially pleaded.Ó Other Local or Personal Acts which are not required to have this Public Clause annexed have each a Clause inserted, at the Suit of the Parties, Ò that the Act shall be printed hy the KingÕs Printer, and that a Copy thereof, so printed, shall be admitted as Evidence thereof by all Judges, Justices, and others.Ó All the Acts of this Second Series are printed together in one Collection. The Third Series contains Such Local and Personal Acts as are without either of the above Clauses, and are therefore not printed. See Reports of the Committee of the House of Commons on the Promulgation of the Statutes, in 1796 and 1801; and Resolutions of the House of Commons 7 May 1801 } and 18, 22, and 24 March 1803.

4. Original Afts.ÑThese, from the 12th Year of Henry VII. to the present Time, with some Interruption, particularly in 14 & 15 Hen. VIII. and ai Hen. VIII. are preserved in the Parliament Office. Some Petitions and Bills previous to 12 Hen. VII. are in the Tower of London, but in no regular Series. The Original Adis in the Parliament Office consist of the Bills as ingrossed after being brought into Parliament, and in the State in which, after such Ingrossment, they passed both Houses, and received the Royal Assent. Each Aft is on a separate Roll numbered ; and Reference is made to them from a Calendar kept of the Afts of each Session in the Parliament Office. These are the Materials from which the Clerk of the Parliaments makes up the Inrollments of Public Afts sent by him into Chancery, and preserved there ; or certifies Afts into Chancery, when required so to do.Ô

As to the comparative Authority of the Original Afts and the Inrollments in Chancery, it is to be observed, that all the Original Afts are separate from each other; and that they are frequently interlined, defaced, erased, and in many Instances, with great Difficulty intelligible :* The Inrollment in Chancery is always fair and distinft ; and the Afts are entered in a regular Series, on one Roll or subsequent Rolls, as Part of the Proceedings of a Par- Lament, the Time of the holding of which is stated at the Beginning of the Roll. In modern Praftice, if any Doubt arises as to the Correftness of the Inrollment in Chancery,Õ Application is made to the Clerk of the Parliaments ; and the original Aft is thereupon produced, and compared with the Inrollment, and an Amend.ment, if requisite, is made in the Inrollment accordingly.

5. Rolls of Parliament.ÑThese contain Entries of the several Transactions in Parliament; when complete they include the Adjournments, and all other common and daily Occurrences and Proceedings from the opening to the close of each Parliament, with the several Petitions or Bills, and the Answers given thereto, not only on public Matters, on which the Statute was afterwards framed, but also on private Concerns. In some few Instances the Statute as drawn up in Form is entered on the Parliament Roll: but in general the Petition and Answer only, are found entered ; and in such Case the Entry, of itself, furnishes no certain Evidence, that the Petition and Answer were at any Time put into the Form of a Statute.4

Copies of Petitions in Parliament and Answers thereto, as early as 6 Edw. I. and in various Years of Edw. II. and Edw. III. are among Lord HaleÕs Manuscripts in the Library of LincolnÕs Inn. Rolls containing Pleas, Petitions and Answers, and other Proceedings in Parliament, from 18 to 35 Edw. I. and one of Petitions in Parliament 7 Hen. V, are in the Chapter House at Westminster. A Book of Inrollment, called Vetus Codex, in which are entered Proceedings in Parliament, from 18 Edw. I. to 35 Edw. I. and in 14 Edw. II, is in the Tower of London.5 In that Repository also are preserved Rolls containing Pleas and other Proceedings in Parliament, between 5 Edw. II. and 13 Edw. Ill; Rolls of Parliament of 9 Edw. II; 4, 5, and 6 Edw. Ill ;6 and 13 Edw. Ill; and from thence, to the End of the Reign of Edward IV, in a regular, and nearly uninterrupted, Series. After that Time the Rolls of Parliament are, for a certain Period, supplied by the Inrollments of Afts preserved in the Chapel of the Rolls,7 and finally by the Journals of the Two Houses of Parliament."

1 It was one of the Functions of the Clerk of the Parliaments to receive, in the Upper House, the Petitions of the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses: See Rot. Pari. 20 Edw. III. nu. 11. And with respect to the Appointment of the Clerk of the Parliaments, See Rot. Pari. 14 Ed. III. nu. 3 : 15 Ed. III. nu. 1 : 17 Ed. III. nu. 1: 18 Ed. III. nu.4: 2 Hen. IV. nu. at : 4 Hen.

5 The Contents of this Volume were printed in 1661, by W. Ryley, a Clerk in the Record Office in the Tower, with an Appendix of additional Matter, under the Title of Placita Parliamentaria. The Original Manuscript Volume is referred to in Rot. Pat. 6 Ric. II. P.2, m. 26, as an Authentic Book of Inrollment, as follows: Ò DÕ Exemplific Tykford. Ik Omibj ad quos, fee. salfm. Inspexim9 tenorem cujusdam. pcepti dni E. quondam Regis Angt fit Regis Henr pgenitoris nri, in quodam libro de pliamentis ejusdem dni E. anno regni sui vicesimo irrotulati in hec verba." Then follows verbatim the Article Ô De Abbati de Mermonster,Õ entered in fo. 36 of the Vetus Codex, and printed in page 102 of RyleyÕs Placita Parliamentaria.

7 See ante page xxxv : And see also Appendix E. for some Instances illustrative of the Contents of the Parliament Rolls, including the earliest Instances of the opening of Parliament by Authority of the KingÕs Commission. As a Specimen of Ôhe Contents of the several Rolls and Manuscripts, from 6 Edw. I. to 19 Hen.VII. the Six Volumes of Ò Rotuli Parliamentorum, ut et Petitiones et Placita in ParliamentoÓ printed by an Order of the House of Lords of 9th March 1767, may be consulted : But this Collection does not contain all the Rolls, Petitions, and Parliamentary Proceedings during that Period; and it is by no Means to be relied upon for correftness.

1 The Journals of the House of Lords commence in 1 Hen. VIII : But of the Years 4, 5, 14 8c 15, at, 22, 23, 24, 26, and 27 Hen. VIII, and of the first two Sessions in I Mary, the Journals have not been preserved. In the printed Editions therefore, the Journals for those Years are supplied by Copies of, and Extrafts from, what are there termed the Parliament Rolls, being the Inrollments in Chancery mentioned above, and particularly described ante page xxxv. The Journals of the House of Commons commence in 1 Edw VI.; But until the Beginning of the Reign of Elizabeth they contain merely short Notes of the several Read.ings of the respeftive Bills before the House, with a few occasional Entries only of other Proceedings. See further Appendix F.

6. The Close, Patent, Fine, and Charter Rolls, among a Variety of Grants, Recognisances, and other Miscel.laneous Matters, concerning the State of the Realm and the Rights of the Crown, recorded in them, include Entries of Statutes, and some Instruments having direCt Reference, to Statutes wherein such Statutes are recited at length. These Rolls are kept at the Tower, from the Beginning of the Reign of King John to 22 Edw. IV, and from the Reign of Edw. V. to the present Time at the Chapel of the Rolls.

7. Books of Record, containing Entries of Statutes and Parliamentary Proceedings.ÑOf this Sort is, The Red Book of the Exchequer at Westminster, some of the early Part of which was compiled by Alexander de Swereford, first a Clerk and afterwards a Baron of the Exchequer,' in the Reign of Henry III. It seems afterwards to have been considered and used as an authorized Repository by the Court itself; and contains Entries and Inrollments of many Charters and antient Adis of Parliament, as well as other Instruments relating to the King and the Rights of the Crown, from the Time of William the Conqueror to the End of Edw. III.: The Originals of several of these Adis and Instruments are preserved in the Tower of London, and in the Chapter House at Westminster, with References to Inrollments in this Book,* or to the Circumstance of the Adi being sent into the Exchequer.1 The Red Book of the Exchequer at Dublin is considered as of the same Authority: It contains Entries of Magna Carta 1 Hen. III. especially granted to the People of Ireland; of the Statute of Westminster the First, 3 Edw. I, (which is not to be found on the Great Roll of Statutes in the Tower of London, being prior in Date to the present Commencement of that Roll,) and also of the Statutes of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I, de Viris Religiosis 7 Edw. I, and Westminster the Second, 13 Edw. I, agreeing in general with the Text of those Statutes on the Statute Roll in the Tower. There is reason to conclude that these Statutes were entered in the Red Book at Dublin, from an Exemplification sent over from England in the 13th Year of Edw. I, as is noticed in a Memoran.dum on the Close Roll of that Year.* A Register Book marked A., preserved at the Chapter House at West.minster, as in the Custody of the Treasurer and Chamberlains of the Exchequer,5 contains Entries or Inroll.ments made in the Time of Edward I. Among these are the Statute of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I, and the Statute of Westminster the Second, 13 Edw. I. The Originals of the several Statutes and Instruments, it is stated in the Register, were deposited in certain Chests in the Chapter House; but these Originals have not been discovered.

8. Books and Manuscripts not of Record, containing Entries or Copies of Statutes, are very numerous. In the Court of Exchequer at Westminster are Three Books, marked IX. X. XI. Book X. contains many of the earlier Statutes previous to Edw. Ill: Books IX. XI. contain the Statutes from 1 Edw. III. to 7 Hen. VIII.

In the Town ClerkÕs Office, at the Guildhall of the City of London, are several Manuscript Volumes ; in which, among other Matters chiefly relating to the Laws and Customs of the City of London, are Entries of many of the antient Statutes previous to Edward III. The greatest Number, and the earliest Copies are in two Volumes, distin.guished by the Appellations, Liber Horn, and Liber C.ustumarum. It appears from internal Evidence that Liber Horn was compiled about the Year 1311, and Liber Custumarum not long after theYear 1320: Liber Horn is rendered valuable by having been in many Instances corrected, in a later Hand Writing, from Exemplifications of Statutes sent under Seal to the Sheriffs of London. In two other Manuscripts, one called Liber de Antiquis Legibus, and the other Transcriptum Libri AIbi, copied from a Volume originally compiled in the Mayoralty of Richard Whityngton A. D. 1419, 7 Hen. V, are occasional Entries of a few antient Statutes. In other Volumes marked G. H. and I. are Entries of some of the Statutes of Edw. III. Richard II. Henry IV. and Henry V ; many of them appearing to have been made from Exemplifications sent to the Sheriffs of London for Proclamation.

Of Manuscript Collections of Statutes, preserved in Public Repositories, the greatest Number collected together in any one Place, is to be found in the British Museum. They are distinguished as being of the Cottonian or Harleian Collection; from the Royal Library; Donation Manuscripts ; and Lansdowne Manuscripts. The Cottonian Manuscripts Claudius D. II. and Vespasian B. VII. were resorted to by Hawkins and Cay, for Copies of Statutes previous to Edw. III.; and Nero C. I. for Statutes of Henry VI. and Edw. IV. not found at the Tower.

In the Bodleian Library at Oxford, are RawlinsonÕs, HattonÕs, and LaudÕs Manuscripts. Among the latter is a Roll of Statutes, No. 1036, consisting of Eleven small Membranes of Parchment united together; not much more than Four Inches wide; but each being Two Feet or more in length. This Roll appears to have been written in the Time of Edw. I: It contains no Statute later than the Articuli super Cartas, 28 Edw. I.

At Cambridge several Manuscript Collections of Statutes are preserved in the Library of the University, and in Trinity College Library. In Corpus Christi or BeneÕt College Library are the Manuscripts bequeathed to the College by Archbishop Parker.

INTRODUCTION. Ch. III. Sett. II, III,

Chartularies or Registers, preserved in several Cathedrals, contain Copies of some of the Old Statutes. Such are the Black Book of the Cathedral of Christ Church Dublin, written between the Years 1280 and 1399, and Register A. in Gloucester Cathedral, compiled in 1397.

In LincolnÕs Inn Library, are Lord HaleÕs Manuscript Copies of Rolls and Petitions in Parliament: In the Inner Temple Library, Mr. PetytÕs Collection of Manuscripts; among which are several Volumes of the Statutes. In many other Public Libraries also, Manuscript Colle&ions of Statutes are preserved.1

Of the several Manuscripts not of Record, an extensive and careful Examination has been made in preparing for the present Edition; and it has been ascertained that, although they differ from each other considerably in their Degrees of Antiquity and Correctness, yet the Credit of no single one is entirely to be relied on ; for scarcely any Manuscript has yet been discovered, in any Repository, in which there are not some material Errors, perverting or altogether destroying the Sense of the Text. In some Instances, however, such as Cott. Claud. D II. in the British Museum, and M m. v. ig, in the Library of the University of Cambridge, several of the Instruments con.tained in the Manuscripts purport to be examined by the Roll. In Liber Horn, in the Town ClerkÕs Office, London, several are marked as examined Ô per CeramÔ per Ceram Gildaule Ô per Statutum Gildaule London in Cera;Õ Ô cum brevi cum eisdetn in Gildaula adjundlÕ; all which signify that the Entry in the Book has been examined with an Exemplification of the Statute or Instrument under the Great Seal, sent to the Mayor and Sheriffs of London with or without a Writ for Publication thereof. The Rawlinson Manuscript No. 337. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and the Harleian Manuscript No. 5022 in the British Museum, refer to the Inrollment on the Statute Roll, of several Articles inserted in those Volumes, but do not profess that the Articles themselves were examined by that Roll.

III. On a mature Consideration of all the Circumstances before stated, the following Rules of Preference have been adhered to, in the Use of the several Sources for the Text, and for Various Readings of the Statutes, in the present Colle&ion.

During the Periods in which Statute Rolls exist, such Statute Rolls have been considered and used as the highest Authority for the Statutes contained in them; namely, the Statutes 6 Edw. I. to 8 Edw. IV.; with the Omission of the Statutes 9 to 23 Hen. VI. both inclusive.

But for such Statutes as, during the Period of the Existence of the Statute Rolls, do not appear on those Rolls; and for Statutes made in any Period of which the Statute Roll is not now in existence, namely previous to 6 Edw. I.; after 8 and before 25 Hen. VI; and after 8 Edw.1V ; and also for the Correction of manifest Errors or Omissions in the Text, whether taken from Statute Rolls or elsewhere, the following Sources have been recurred to in regular Gradation ; preference being given to them according to the following Order, but all being used and collated, where necessary: viz. 1. InroIIments of Ads.Ñ2. Exemplifications and Transcripts.Ñ3. Original Adis.Ñ

4. Rolls of Parliament.Ñ5. Close, Patent, Fine, and Charter Rolls.Ñ6. Entries and Books of Record.Ñ 7. Books and Manuscripts not of Record.ÑAnd finally, 8. The Printed Copies; the earliest of which was not published until more than two hundred Years subsequent to the present Commencement of the Statute Rolls.

The following Reasons for Preference among Manuscripts not of Record have been adopted : 1. Their

professing to be Authentic Copies from any Records, Exemplifications, or Transcripts : 2. Their Age; the oldest being on the whole the most worthy of Credit: 3. The Uniformity and Regularity of the Series of Statutes, and Instruments in each Collection : 4. Their having been already printed, and received in use, as Evidence of the Text of Statutes ; or, if not so printed, their according with the printed Copies, and with each other, so that when the Manuscripts differ, the Majority should prevail: 5. Certain Manuscripts have been holden to be of superior Authority upon some particular Subjects, having special Connexion with the Places in which they are preserved : Such as the Books preserved in the Exchequer, for Statutes relating to that Court, or to Accounts, or to Money ; Books at the Town ClerkÕs Office, London, relating to the Assises of Bread and Ale, Weights, and Measures, Ac :

6. In all Manuscripts some Articles are found much more corre& than others; a Judgment has therefore frequently been formed from internal Evidence in Favour of a particular Statute or Reading, although the Manuscript in which such Statute or Reading were found, might not, in other Instances, be entitled to Preference :

7. Where it has happened that several Manuscripts agreed in the Text or Reading of any Instrument, and were so equal in their Claims for Preference, that it was entirely Matter of Indifference which should be chosen for a Source of Extract or Quotation, that Manuscript has been used which has been quoted or extracted from for other Purposes, in Preference to one not before quoted ; and one which has already been printed from, in Preference to one which has not.

Sect. III.

Of the Mode used in searching for, transcribing, collating, noting, and printing the Text of the Statutes.

Immediately after the Commissioners had given their Directions for proceeding upon the Work, according to the Plans submitted to and approved of by them, Searches were made in the Tower of London and other principal Repositories in the Metropolis, which, by the Returns made to the Committee of the House of Commons upon Public Records, appeared to contain Authentic Records or antient Copies of Statutes; and in 1806, as hath been before-mentioned, every other Place of the same Description in England and Ireland was visited by Two Sub-Commissioners. Upon these Occasions, the Statute, Parliament, Close, Patent, Fine, and Charter Rolls, and other Records and Manuscripts preserved in the several Repositories, were examined : Reports of the Contents of these Records or Manuscripts were from Time to Time laid before the Commissioners:

1 See Appendix C. in which the several Records and Manuscripts in the respective Repositories are particularized.

Go gle

Numerous and repeated Transcripts and Collations were made, not only of the Statutes heretofore printed, but also of very many Instruments considered as fit to be introduced at Length, or as affording Materials for Notes and various Readings: And the printed Editions from the earliest Period to the present Time were colleded together, examined, and compared with each other. From the whole of these Materials Lists were prepared of the Matters to be admitted, referring to the several Records, Manuscripts, and Books, in which they were respectively preserved or published. All the Transcripts and Collations made of these Matters were compared with each other, and with the printed Copies. The Transcript which, on full Examination, appeared to be made from the most authentic Source was used as the Copy of the Text to be printed : All the other Transcripts and Collations of the same Instrument, as also the printed Editions, were then compared and collated with this Copy; and the requisite Various Readings noted accordingly.

The Various Readings are suggested, in the following Manner; First, By substituting one Reading for another: In this Case the Word or Sentence in the Text, of which an Alteration is suggested, is included between two Crotchets, with a Figure of Reference to the Note; and in the Note is inserted the Word or Sentence proposed to be substituted, with a Quotation of the Record or Manuscript or printed Copies in which it is found. Secondly, By inserting some Word or Sentence omitted: In this Case a Reference is included within a Parenthesis, and the Word or Sentence to be inserted is supplied in the Note. Thirdly, By noting the Omission, in other Copies, of a Word or Sentence inserted in the Text: In this Case the Word or Sentence in the Text is included between Crotchets with a Reference, and in the Note the Copies which omit such Word or Sentence are particularized.

The Entries on the Statute Rolls and Records of Chancery are very seldom broken into separate Paragraphs; though other Manuscripts are more frequently so divided. In all Cases where there is any Division of Paragraphs in the Record or Manuscript, the like Division has been made in the Transcript. The Transcript has been also occasionally divided into separate Chapters or Paragraphs, in Conformity with the printed Editions of the Statutes, and for the Convenience of Reference, in Places where such Division did not occur in the Record or Manuscript: But this has been done only when a full Stop or other Mark in the Manuscript appeared to justify the complete Separation of the Sentences. The Points or Stops are conformable to those in the Record ; and in printing the Text of the antient Statutes, the same Mode has been adopted as with resped to the Charters, of exhibiting the Contradions as near as may be to the likeness of the Original Charaders. Where the Chapters or Clauses are numbered in the Record or Manuscript, such Number has been inserted in the Transcript. And the Numbers of the Chapters and Clauses in CayÕs Edition, or the other Printed Editions from which the Translation is taken, are inserted at the Head of the Side Note or Abridgement affixed to the Translation.

In this State the Copy was sent to the Printer. The Proof Sheets supplied by him were in the First Instance compared with the Manuscript Transcripts. These Proofs being correded, they were next compared with the Original Record, or Manuscript Authority from which such Transcripts were made. In Cases of Various Readings, the whole Article as printed, was also read and compared with the Record or Manuscripts from whence the Various Readings were suggested; and further Suggestions as to Notes of Various Readings and Amendments were adopted, as they continued to occur. The Sheets thus correded, were again compared with the Record or Manuscript Authority, and the necessary Corredions marked thereon ; which being made by the Printer, the Sheets were revised, and occasionally submitted to the Commissioners, under whose Diredions many Amendments were made ; and the Sheets were then finally printed off for the Work, as they now appear.

Sect. I. Of the Original Language of the Charters and Statutes. Sect. II. Of the Translation in this ColleElion of the Statutes.

Sect. I.

Of the Original Language of the Charters and Statutes.

The Language of the Charters and Statutes, from the Period of the earliest Charter now given, i Henry I. to the Beginning of the Reign of Henry VII. is Latin or French. From that Time it has been uniformly English. The Petitions or Bills on which the Statutes were founded, began to be generally in English early in the Reign of Hen. VI.

All the Charters of Liberties, and of the Forest, from i Hen. I. to 29 Edw. I. (with the Exception after men.tioned,) are in Latin; but Translations of some of them into French, are found in various Colledions. In DÕAcheryÕs Spicilegium' there is a French Translation, as it is called by Blackstone, of the Charter of King John; for it is doubtful whether that Charter tvas ever promulgated in French in this Kingdom. Some early Manuscripts1 contain French Translations of the Two Charters of 9 Hen. Ill, and of the Charters of Inspeximus and Confirmation in 25 and 28 Edward I, though these latter appear on the Statute and Charter Rolls in Latin. The Charter dated 5 Nov. 25 Edw. 1,3 is in French; as is also the Duplicate of that Charter dated to Od. and entered on the Statute Roll 25 Edw. 1/

The Statutes of Henry III. are almost entirely in Latin. Some Legislative Matters, not m thfc Printed Colle&ions, are entered on the Patent Rolls in French. Ô

The Statutes of Edward I. are indiscriminately in Latin or French ; though the foi mer Language is most prevalent. But the Statute of Gloucester 6 Edward I. which on the Statute Roll is in French, appears in many contemporary Manuscripts in Latin. In several M ami scrip's, particularly Register A. in the Chapter House at Westminster, this Statute is given at length both hi Latin and French. On the other hand the Statute of Westminster the Second, 13 Edw. I. which is in Latin cm the Roll, appears in many Manuscripts in French ; and Chapter 34 of this latter Statute, as to Violence against Women, which on the Roll appears in French, is given, like the rest of the Statute, in Latin, in several Manuscripts*. The French Chapter, 49, as to Champerty by Justices, is omitted in the Tower Roll, and in many other Copies, which give the Statutes in Latin, but is found in the Ccples which give the Statute in French.3

The Statutes of Edward II. are, like those of Edward I, indiscriminately in Latin or French; but the latter Language prevails more than in the Statutes of Edward I.

The Statutes of Edward III. are more generally in French than those of any preceding King: yet some.fcw are in Latin. The Statutes of Richard II. are almost universally in French; those of the Sixth and Eighth Years are in Latin. The Statutes of Henry IV, with the Exception of Chapter 15 of the Statute 3 Hen. IV; which is in Latin, are entirely in French; as are those of Henry V, with the Exception of the short Statutes 5 and 7 Henry V. which appear in Latin.

The earliest Instance recorded of the Use of the English Language in any Parliamentary Proceeding, is in 36 Edw. III. The Stile of the Roll of that Year is in French as usual, but it is expressly stated that the Causes of summoning the Parliament were declared Ò en Englois4 and the like Circumstance is noted in 37 and 38 Edw. IILS In die Fifth Year of Richard II,6 the Chancellor is stated to have made Ô un bone collaciofi en Engleys Õ {introductory, as was then sometimes the Usage, to the Commencement of Business) though he made use of the common French form for opening the Parliament. A Petition from the Ò Folk of the Mercerye of LondonÓ, in the loth Year of the same Reign7, is in English; and it appears also, that in the 17th Year* the Earl of Arundel asked Pardon of the Duke of Lancaster by the Award of the King and Lords, in their Presence in Parliament, in a form of English Words. The Cession and Renunciation of the Crown by kichard II. is stated to have been read before the Estates of the Realm and the People in Westminster Hall, first in Latin and afterwards in English, but it is entered on the Parliament Roll only in Latin.9 And the Challenge of the Crown by Henry IV. with his Thanks after the Allowance of his Title, in the same Assembly, are recorded in English ; which is termed his maternal Tongue So also is the Speech of Sir William Thirnyng, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, tb the late King Richard, announcing to him the Sentence of his Deposition, and the yielding up, on the Part of the People, of their Fealty and Allegiance. In the Sixth Year of the Reign of Henry IV." an English Answer is given to a Petition of the Commons, touching a proposed Resumption of certain Grants of the Crown, to the Intent the King might the better live of his own. The English Language afterwards appears occa.sionally, through the Reigns of Hen. IV. and V."

In the First and Second, and subsequent Years of Hen. VI. the Petitions or Bills, and in many Cases the Answers also, oil which the Statutes were afterwards framed, are found frequently in English ; but the Statutes are entered on the Roll in French or Latin. From the 23d Year of Hen. VI. these Petitions or Bills are almost universally in English, as is also sometimes the Form of the Royal Assent: But the Statute continued to be inrolled in French or Latin'3. Sometimes Latin and French are used in the same Statute, as in 8 Hen. VI.; 27 Hen. VI.; and 39 Hen. VI. The last Statute wholly in Latin on Record is 33 Hen. VI. ; the last portion of any Statute in Latin is 39 Hen. VI; Chapter 2.

The Statutes of Edward IV. are entirely in French. The Statutes of Richard III. are in many Manuscripts in French, in a complete Statute Form ; and they were so printed in his Reign and that of his Successor. In the earlier English Editions a Translation was inserted, in the same Form : But in several Editions, since 1618, they have been printed in English, in a different Form, agreeing, so far as relates to the A£Is printed, with the Inrollment in Chancery at the Chapel of the Rolls. The Petitions and Bills in Parliament, during these two Reigns, are all in English.

The Statutes of Hen. VII. have always, it is believed, been published in English; but there are Manuscripts containing the Statutes of the first Two Parliaments, in his First and Third Year, in French From the Fourth Year to the End of his Reign, and from thence to the present Time, they are universally in English.

VII. the Statutes of the Third Year are in French ; but those of the Fourth and all the following Years are in English. The old Printed Editions of the Statutes 1 and 3 Hen. VII. in English, appear to be taken entirely from a Statute Roll; while in the modern Editions, some parts of the Statutes are manifestly taken from the Original Acts, or from a Parliament Roll or Inrollment in Chancery.

Attempts have been made by many learned Persons to explain this Variety of Languages in the earlier Periods of our Legislation ; and some have referred the Preference of the one Language or of the other to the Operation of particular Causes.' Nothing, however, is known with Certainty on this Subject; and at the present Day it is utterly impossible to account, in each Instance, for the Appearance of the Statute in French or in Latin. It seems oh the whole to be highly probable that for a long Period of Time, Charters, Statutes, and other Public Instruments were drawn up indiscriminately in French or Latin, and generally translated from one of those Lan.guages into the other *, before the Promulgation of them, which in many Instances appears to have been made at the same Time In both Languages. *

It is Matter of Curiosity to observe, that the Use of the French Language in Statutes was preserved rather longer in Ireland than in England. The Statute Roll of the Irish Parliament 8 Henry VII. preserved at the Rolls Office in Dublin, is in French; on the Statute Roll of the two next Parliaments of Ireland, 16 and 23 Hen. VIL the Introduftory Paragraphs stating the holding of the Parliament, &c. are in Latin; after which follows an AS or Chapter in French, confirming the Liberties of the Church and the Land : and all the other A&s of the Session are in English.

Sect. II.

Of the ÔTranslation in this Collection of the Statutes.

The Printed Translation of the Statutes previous to Hen. VII. used for the present Work, is that of Cay's Edition 1751 : But as many Statutes and Parts of Statutes are omitted from the English of that Edition, the Deficiencies have been supplied from the Edition by Hawkins 1735, the Folio Edition 1618, usually called RastallÕs; PultonÕs Edition of the same Year; RastallÕs Colleftion in English 1603 ; and, in some few Instances from earlier English Colledlions, and other Authorities.4 Of Statutes and Instruments or Parts thereof, not heretofore translated, and of such only, a Translation has been now made, which is always distinguished by being printed in a smaller Type. In making this new Translation, the following Rules have been generally adhered to: To render the Original as literally as possible, consistently with the Purpose of conveying the Sense in English : and to translate the same Word the same Way, if the Sense be the same. Former Translators of the Statutes having very much conformed to the Genius of the English Language in their Versions, and not servilely fallen into Latin or French Expressions or Forms pf Speech, an Endeavour has been made to adopt Language of a Cast corresponding with those Versions.

In the Bodleian Library, Rawlinson Manuscript, No. 230, is a very antient Translation of some of the Statutes of the Time of Hen. III. and Edw. I. There is reason to think, that this Translation is of a Time certainly not later than Edward III, and probably of an earlier Period : It does not contain any Statute later than Ô 25 Edward I. In the British Museum, Harleian Manuscript No. 4999, is a Translation of the Statutes 1 Edw. III. to 18 Hen. VI, made apparently in the Time of Henry VI, or Edward IV.

For the Purpose of correfting Errors in the Translation, the several Editions, as well of the Text as of the Translation, have been compared with each other; and much Use has also been made of the two Manuscript Translations just noticed, which are cited thus, the Rawlinson Manuscript as MS. Tr. i. and the Harleian Manuscript as MS. Tr. 2 : After the Commencement of the Reign of Henry VI., the Petitions or Bills entered in English on the Parliament Roll, from whence the Statute was drawn up in French or Latin, have been consulted.

Correftions of Errors in the Translation which arise from Misinterpretation or Omission, are suggested either from other Translations, or, where no other Translation supplies a probable Correction, by new Expressions. Errors or Inconsistencies which arise from the Insertion of Words or Sentences, not authorized by the Text as given in the present Work, are noticed, either by a Reference to Records or Manuscript Authorities, or to antient Printed Copies of the Latin or French Text as authorizing such Insertion, or by a proposed Omission of the Words so inserted, in consequence of their not being justified by any. Authority. Trifling Variances between the Text and the Translation, manifestly not affefting the Sense, have not been considered worthy of Notice ; particularly where all former Translations agree in the same Reading. But as it was difficult, not to say impossible, to lay down any certain Standard on this latter Head, a Consistency entirely perfect may not have been uniformly observed, and is not to be expected.

1 See 2 Inst. 485, as to the Two Chapters of Stat. Westm. 2. which are in French, although the Body of tire Statute is in Latin. Barrington in his Comments on the Statutum de Scaccario, remarks that when the Interests of the Clergy are particularly concerned, the Statute is in Latin : But on Examination, the correOness of this Remark may be doubted : See also N. BaconÕs Treatise on Government, Part I. Cap. 56. (pa. 101. 4t¡Edit. 1760.)

1 See LudersÕs Essay on the Use of the French Language, in our ancient Laws and A£ls of State; Tract. VI. 1810; where it is suggested that many of the Latin Statutes were first made in French, and from thence translated into Latin.

The Notes and Marks suggesting the Corredions in the Translation, are to be thus understood : First, Words which are included between Crotchets, without any Note of Reference, are such as are contained in all Translations, and are authorized by Printed Copies of the Latin or French Text; though not authorized by the Text, or by any Various Reading, here given, from Manuscript Records or Authorities. Secondly, Words in the Translation included between Crotchets, with a Figure, refer to a Corredion thereof, suggested in the Note; such Corredion, if authorized by any Printed or Manuscript Translation, is printed in the Note in Roman Letter; but if not so authorized, then such Corredion is printed in Italic Letter ; if the Corredion be justified by the Rolls of Parliament or old Manuscript Translations, they are quoted. Thirdly, A Reference within a Parenthesis between Two Words, suggests an Omission, which is supplied in the Notes, in Roman or Italic Charader, according as it is or is not authorized, as before specified. Fourthly, Where any Words in the Translation are inclosed between Crotchets, with Reference to the Note Ò Not in Original,Ó it is to be understood, that neither the Text, as now given from the Record or Manuscript, nor any printed Copy, appears to authorize the Insertion of the Words. The Term Ò Old Translations Ó is applied to all published previous to the Year 1618 ; in which Year the Editions distin.guished as Rastall's and PultonÕs Statutes were both published: The Edition called RastallÕs, however, having followed the Current of several former Editions of the Statutes, is included in the Term Ò OldÕÕ Translations ; and PultonÕs Translation being in many Parts new, and having been generally adopted by Cay and subsequent Editors, is therefore included in the Term Ò Modern.Ó

Short Abstracts or Side Notes have been prepared, as well to the Matters heretofore translated, as to those of which a Translation is now for the first Time given in this Publication; of those relating to Matters heretofore translated, some have been taken from CayÕs, or former English Editions of the Statutes; and like Abstrads are added to the Ads subsequent to the Reign of Hen. VII.

Sect. I.

Of the Collections of the Statutes of Scotland and Ireland, heretofore published by Royal

or Parliamentary Authority.

Although no General Colledion of the Statutes of England, or of Great Britain, has been hitherto published by Authority of the Crown or of the Parliament, it appears that Measures were carefully taken in former Times for colleding and authenticating the Legislative Ads, both of the Scottish and Irish Parliaments.

In Scotland, by Royal Commission from Queen Mary, dated i May 1566, direded to The Chancellor, Principal Officers of State, and other Persons therein named, it was ordained that all the Laws of that Realm should be inspeded, and correded, so that no other but those, should be printed by Royal Privilege, or have Place, Faith, or Authority in Courts of Justice : and by the same Commission it was provided that the Proceedings under it should be ratified in the next Parliament. From the Difficulties of the Undertaking, the Compilation of the Laws prior to James I, was postponed ; and the only part of the Work executed was a Colledion of Ads from the Return of James I, in 1424, to the last Parliament of Queen Mary in 1564. This Colledion was first published in the Year 1566. It comprehended a Publication of certain Statutes of James V. printed in 1541, and of Queen Mary printed in 1565, to each of which the Lord Clerk Register, at the Time, had subjoined his Certificate vouching for the truth of the Copies extraded from the Books of Parliament. These Certificates were retained in this Edition of 1566, and to the other Parts of it similar Certificates were subjoined.'

Other Publications were afterwards made by Authority ; such were those of James VI. 1568 and 1579, and several others prior in Date to 1597 ; but they related only to particular Parliaments or particular sorts of Ads ; and with these concludes that series of Printed Scottish Ads, which from their Typographical Charader have in late Times been usually denominated The Black Acts.

In 1591 A Parliamentary Commission was issued Ò For vistting and caussing of the Lawes and Adis of Parliament to be prented,Ó * which appears to have led in the first instance to the Republication of the Scottish Statutes from the A£ra of James I. to 1597, in the Volumes which usually bear the name of Skene's Edition, Sir John Skene being at that Time Lord Clerk Register. But under the same Commission, Sir John Skene appears also to have proceeded to the more arduous talk of colleding the antient Laws of Scotland prior to James I.: and in 1607 he had advanced so far in this Undertaking as to exhibit to the Legislature a Copy of the Manuscripts which he had prepared for Publication, and for his encouragement therein a Special Ad was passed.1 The Work, usually known by the Title of Regiam Majestatem, was at length published, in the Original Latin, in 1609; and was fallowed soon after by a Version in the Scottish Language.

Other Commissions for Ò Surveying the LawesÓ were issued at subsequent Periods. The Commission of 1628 after several Renewals was ratified by Parliament in 1633 ; and in 1681 another was issued which was again renewed in 1695. But the purpose intended was never accomplished.

Upon all these Editions from the earliest downwards, it is to be observed thaf they contain only a SeleClion from the Records of Parliament, of such Acts as were supposed by the Editors to be of greater and more permanent Utility; omitting such as were either temporary, or merely of a private and personal Nature

The Statutes of Ireland from 10 Hen. VI. to 14 Eliz. were collefted onder the Authority of Sir Henry Sidney, Lord Deputy of that Kingdom in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth ; * and being examined by the Justices of both the Benches, with The Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Master of the Rolls, and delivered by them to the Lord Deputy with their Hands subscribed thereto, they were afterwards, by the Advice of Lord Burleigh, then Lord High Treasurer of England, printed in the Year 1572.1 * *

At a subsequent Period, namely in 1621, another Collection of the Statutes of Ireland from 3 Edw. II. to 13 Jac. I. was abstracted from the Parliament Rolls of that Kingdom by Sir Richard Bolton, Recorder of Dublin; afterwards Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and in 1639 Lord Chancellor of Ireland ; and by Direction of Sir Oliver St. John, then Lord Deputy, that Collection was perused by the Chief Judges and the Master of the Rolls, and by them allowed and thought fit to be printed, together with so many of the Statutes formerly printed, as were not by express Words repealed. And it is deserving of Observation that they thought those Statutes formerly printed and not expressly repealed, should be prated again, for Two Reasons, as therein is stated; Ò the one, lest peradventure any should unadvisedly tax the Editor of Partiality, that Matters of great Moment were omitted, and Matters of less Consequence published; and the other was, that although those Statutes might be out of Use or determined at that Day, yet the same might well serve for an Historical Use, whereby might be discerned both the State of the Church and Commonwealth in those Times.Ó 4

In 1678 the Edition of 1621 was reprinted by the KingÕs Printer, with the addition of the subsequent Ads, to the end of the Session 17 and 18 Car. II; and this Volume was reprinted in 1723 without any Additions.

In 1762 an Address was presented by the House of Lords in Ireland to the Lord Lieutenant, requesting that the Statutes at Large of that Kingdom should be printed and published, under the Inspection of the Lord Chancellor and the Judges.5 6 They were accordingly published in the year 1765, in Seven Volumes Folio, comprehending the Statutes from 3 Edw. II. to 1 George III.: with an Eighth Volume containing Tables of the Titles of the Statutes in the feveral Volumes, and of the Private ACts from 1 Henry VIII. to i George III. and an Alphabetical Index to the Statutes.

In these Volumes, which in the Title Page are stated to be Ò Published by Authority,Õ* the Statutes to 17 & 18 Car. II. were reprinted from the Editions of 1621, 1678, and 1723; the Edition of 1572 not being noticed or referred to. For the period subsequent to 17 and 18 Car. II. recourse was had to the Sessional Publications printed by the KingÕs Printers. The whole Work was compiled from these Sources without Variation ; except that in some instances Errors of the Press were occasionally corrected by the Record ; and that some Public ACts, of which the Titles only were specified in the former Printed Editions, were inserted at large from the Records. Ô Some ACts inserted in the Edition of 1572 are omitted from this Collection.

Additional Volumes, containing the ACts of subsequent Parliaments, were from time to time published, in consequence of occasional Addresses of the House of Lords for that Purpose: and in 1786 a Re-publication of all the former Volumes took place, with additional Volumes to 26 Geo. III. These were continued by subsequent Volumes, to the end of 40 Geo. III. A.D. 1800, when the Union took place between Great Britain and Ireland.Õ

In 1799 a Volume was published containing the Titles of the Statutes and of the Private ACls, and Indexes, to the end of the Session 38 Geo. III. 1798.

1 From the Period of SkeneÕs Publication in 1597 down to the Union, the ACls of each Parliament and Session were regularly

printed and published under the Authority of the Clerk Register j and under that Authority, but without any special SanCtion by Parliament, Sir Thomas Murray published his Edition of the Statutes in 1681, annexing to it his Official Certificate of Authority ; but his Text appears to be taken only from the Edition by Skene and the subsequent Sessional Publications.

Sect. II.

Of the Methods successively adopted for promulgating the Statutes, before and since the Union of

Great Britain and Ireland.

The Promulgation of the Statutes, which formerly took place within the Realm of England, as well as in Scotland and Ireland, has been wholly superseded by the Praftice of modem Times. Before the Introduction of Printing, the Publication of the Statutes of England was made by Means of Exemplifications thereof, sent to the Sheriffs, under the Great Seal, out of Chancery, with Writs annexed, requiring the Procla.mation and Publication of the same by them,' and sometimes also directing Copies to be made and distributed, and the Sheriffs to return what was done by them thereupon. The earliest Statutes were published in this Manner; as appears not only by Copies of the Writs subjoined to the Records and Manuscripts of the respective Statutes, of the Thirteenth Century, but also by Original Writs still preserved in the Tower of London.*

In England printed Promulgations of the Statutes, in the Form of Sessional Publications,1 began in the First Year of Ric. III. A-D. 1484, very recently after the Introduction of Printing; and in consequence thereof such Exemplifications and Writs as are above mentioned were soon altogether discontinued yet the Statutes themselves, continued nevertheless to be inrolled in Chancery 5 and some of the earliest Sessional Publications appear by their Form to have been printed from a Statute Roll. All the Original Bills and Afts now extant in the Parliament Office, are some Years subsequent in Date to the Commencement of the Printed Sessional Publications of the Statutes; and it is evident, from some of those Printed Sessional Publications in the Time of Hen. VII. whereof the contemporary Bills and Adis are still preserved, that such Bills and Afts, though concurrent in Time were not then uniformly used as the Original Text for such Publications. The Sessional Publications are at present, and have tor a long Series of Years been printed entirely from Original Afts in the Parliament Office.Õ

In Scotland it was the exclusive Privilege and official Duty of the Lord Clerk Register to enter the Afts of Parliament in the proper Record, and to give authentic Copies of them to the Sheriffs, Magistrates of Boroughs, and such as might demand them. A Precept is extant for proclaiming and publishing the Statutes of Robert I. in the Year 1318 ; and there exists also a Parliamentary Ordinance made in the Reign of David II. 1366, by which the Afts of that Parliament are direfted to be sent under Royal Seal to each Sheriff to be by him publickly proclaimed.6 The earliest printed Publication of Statutes in Scotland took place in the year 1540-1.

In Ireland the Promulgation of such Statutes as were passed in England and transmitted to Ireland, was regularly made by means of a Transcript sent under Seal from England, with a Writ direfted to the Chancellor of Ireland, requiring the same to be kept in the Chancery of that Kingdom, to be enrolled in the Rolls of the said Chancery, then to be exemplified under the Great Seal of Ireland, and sent unto and proclaimed in the several Courts and Counties throughout the Kingdom.7 Sometimes the Writ was to the Justices, in Ireland, simply requiring Proclamation.8

With respeft to the Statutes made in Ireland, Provisions are contained in several Afts for the special Procla.mation of such Afts, so that the Penalties inflifted by them should not be incurred until after such Proclamation.9 It appears also that it was usual to proclaim the Statutes in general by the KingÕs Writ, made out by the Clerk of the Parliament.'0 Sessional Publications of the Afts did not take place in Ireland before the Reign of Charles I; and such Publications were not continued regularly and uniformly until after the Revolution."

Copies of Parliamentary Proceedings, or Afts of State, though not Statutes, were occasionally proclaimed and published. See the Roll of the Ordinances of the Staple 27 E.

4 The last Proclamation Writ entered on the Statute Rolls, is at the end of Stat. 7 Hen. V. A.D. 1419 ; Lord Coke, 2 Inst. 526, says the Writ continued to issue till the Reign of Henry VII. In the Printed Editions of the Statutes, a Proclamation Writ is prefixed to the Statutes of 19 Hen, VII.

5 See CommonsÕ Journals vol. viii, nth January 1661-2, when it was resolved that a Message should be sent to the Lords, requesting Ò that the Original Rolls of Afts of Parliament be kept in the Office, and not delivered to the Printer, but that true Copies be delivered to him from the Roll, fairly written and carefully examined and attested.Ó

In Great Britain the Public Inconvenience experienced from the defective Promulgation of the Statutes, led to the Adoption of new Measures in the Year 1796 ; by which, the Afts printed by the KingÕs Printer, whose Authority has been long deemed sufficient to entitle his Printed Copies to be received in Evidence, in all Courts of Law,' were distributed throughout the Kingdom as speedily as possible after they had received the Royal Assent:' And the Experience of the good Effects of those Measures led soon afterwards to their Execution in a much greater Extent.

After The Union of Great Britain and Ireland, a Seleft Committee of the House of Commons was appointed in the first Session of the United Parliament, to consider of the most effeftual Means of Promulgating the Statutes of the United Kingdom ; upon whose Report Resolutions for that Purpose were adopted by the Commons, and having been agreed to by the Lords, they were presented to His Majesty by a Joint Address of both Houses; and His Majesty was thereupon pleased to give Direftions accordingly.* 1

By the Tenor of these Resolutions, His MajestyÕs Printer was authorized and directed to print not less than Five thousand five hundred Copies of every Public General Aft, and Three hundred Copies of such Local and Personal Afts as were printed * ; the Public General Afts to be transmitted, as soon as possible after each Bill should receive the Royal Assent, to the Members of both Houses of Parliament, the great Officers and Departments of State, Public Libraries, Courts of Justice, Sheriffs, Municipal Magistrates, and Resident afting Justices of the Peace, throughout Great Britain and Ireland ; according to a prescribed Mode of Distribution; with a Direftion that every Chief Magistrate and Head Officer of every City, Borough, or Town Corporate in England and Ireland, and of every Royal Burgh in Scotland, and every Sheriff, Clerk of the Peace, and Town Clerk in the United Kingdom, receiving such Copies, should preserve them for the Public Use, and transmit them to his Successor in Office: And this Mode of authenticating and Promulgating the Statutes is now carried into Execution, throughout every part of the United Kingdom.

' By Stat. 41 Geo. 3. (U.K.) c. 90. € 9. it is expressly provided, that the Copy of the Statutes of England and Great Britain printed by the KingÕs Printer, shall be Evidence in Ireland, and that the Copy of the Statutes in Ireland, primed by the KingÕs Printer, shall be Evidence in Great Britain, of the Statutes respectively passed, previous to the Union between Great Britain and Ireland.

Continued after the Method of Mr. Pulton, with References one to the other, &c ; Titles of the Private Acts; and a Table of principal Matters. By Thomas MANBYEsq.ÑLondon printed, &c. Cum gratia & Privilegio Regie Majestatis.

The First Edition ended with the Statutes 19 Car. II.

The Statutes 20 and 22 Car. II. were added afterwards.

The Statutes at Large in Paragraphs [theTitle to the Edit. 1681 adds here Ò and Sections or Numbers,Ó] from Magna Charta until this time, [Ò untill the reign of K.Charles II.Ó Edit. 1684, &c.] carefully examined by the Rolls of Parliament: With the Titles of such Statutes as are expired, repealed, altered or out of use. Together with the Heads of PultonÕs, or RastallÕs Abridgements in the Margin, and the addition of New References from other Books of Law ; and a new Table. [/. e. Index] : By Joseph Keble of GrayÕs Inn Esquire.Ó

The Edition 1695 continues the Title thus; Ò In this Impression are added all the Statutes made in the reign of K. James II. King William and Queen Mary to the End of the last Session of Parliament May 3, 1695; in the 7"* year of the Reign of his Majesty K. Will. III. In Two Volumes.

The Statutes at large in Paragraphs and Sections or Numbers from Magna Charta to the end of theSession of Parliament, March 14, 1704; in the fourth year of the Reign of her Majesty Queen Anne. Carefully examined by the Rolls of Parliament. With the Titles of such Statutes as are expired, repealed, altered, or out of use; together with the Heads of PultonÕs or RastallÕs Abridgements in the Margin ; and above One thousand References from other Books of Law, with Alphabetical Tables In Three Volumes.

Vol. I. contains the Statutes, in English, from Magna Carta to 43 Eliz.ÑVol. II, from 1 Jac. I. to 6 8c 7 Will. III. with Indexes to all the Statutes in both Volumes. These two Volumes appear very similar to the latest Edition of KebleÕs Statutes 1695, ffom which perhaps they differ in nothing but the Title Page. The Title in Vol. III. in some Copies is Ò A Supplement to the last Edition of the Statute Book, beginning with the seventh and eighth years of the Reign of King William III. and continued to the End of theSession of Parliament, March 14, 1704, in the fourth year of the Reign of Her Majesty Queen Anne ; carefully examined by the Rolls of Parliament.

Addenda to the third Volume of the Statutes at large ; begin.ning with the fourth year of the Reign of Q. Anne, and continued to the End of the last Session of Parliament, April 1, 1708, in the seventh year of her MajestyÕs Reign. Carefully examined by the Rolls of Parliament, With an Alphabetical Table.

Statutes at Large from the seventh year of Q. Anne to the End of the eighth and last Session of the fifth Parliament of Great Britain, 7th March 1722, 8 Geo. I. Carefully examined by the Rolls of Parliament. With an Alpha.betical Table. In Two Volumes.

[ These two Volumes serve as Vol. IV. and V. of the Statutes printed in 1706, and the Addenda 1708. No. 51, 52 The Table is at the End of the Second Volume.']

The Statutes at Large from Magna Charta to the Seventh Year of King George the Second inclusive. In Six Volumes, by William Hawkins Esq. Serjeant at Law.

In most Copies of this Work, Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest, are printed from the Statute Roll in the Tower; though by an Error of the Press the Quotation Ò Ex MS. in Bibliotheca CottonÓ is printed at the beginning of the Charter of the Forest; the Quotation in the sub.sequent Pages being Ç Ex Rot. Orig. in Turr. Lond. But one Copy, at least, of this Volume still exists i which the Great Charter is printed from 2 Inst, and also from MS. Cott. Claud. D. II. and the Charter of the Forest from that MS. only. It may therefore be concluded that in the general impression these Pages were cancelled, and the Copies printed from the Statute Roll substituted in their place.

PRINTED SESSIONAL PUBLICATIONS

OF THE STATUTES

OF

ENGLAND.

These Publications, from 1 Ric.III. to 3 Car. I. inclusive, contain the Body of the Statute as made in each Session ; the several Ails or Chapters thereof, being distinguished by Numbers and Titles. From 16 Car. I. they consist of the several Ails of the Session ; each being printed separately, but paged progressively, from the beginning to the End of the Session. Of many of the Sessions several Editions were printed. From the Time of the Union with Scotland, the Sessional Publications are preserved (in a Series nearly perfeii) in the Office of the Clerk of the Fees, at the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; where some of the Sessional Acts from 1 William and Mary to 1 Anne, are also to be found; but none previous to 1 William and Mary. In the Library of Norwich Cathedral, the Sessional Publications from 1 Jac. II. to 1 Anne are complete in 14 Volumes. Some of the earliest Sessional Publications are preserved in various Public Libraries, but no perfect Series has yet been collected together ; and of some few Tears, no printed Copy is now known to exist. None of the Private Acts are included in any of these Publications ; but their Titles are prefixed or subjoined to the Statutes of each Session after 13 Eliz. in Tables of Acts not printed.

In January 1628, at the Commencement of the Second Session of this Parliament, (which was suddenly determined without any Aft being passed,) a Committee was appointed to inquire as to the printing of these Additions to the Petition of Right, when on Examination of the Printers it appeared, that 1500 Copies of the Petition, with the KingÕs second Answer only thereto, had been printed during the preceding Session, Ò whereof few were divulged and that immediately after the Conclusion of that Session those Copies were suppressed, and the others, with the Additions, printed by Special Warrant for the Purpose.

Explanation of the Contractions,

Used in printing the Records and Manuscripts copied in this Collection.

THE general Charadber and Appearance of the Charters and Records copied in this Colledtion, are exhibited in engraved Specimens.* With respedt to the Printed Contractions, it is to be observed, that wherever the Manuscript is abbreviated, the Print has a Mark of Contraction, as similar to that of the Manuscript as the Types will admit. The differeni Manuscripts vary a little from each other in the Mode of making the several Contra&ions. The following Explanadon of the Marks of Contradlion used in the Print (applying both to the Latin and French Text, though the latter is generally less abbreviated than the former), may serve as well to render the printed Copy intelligible, as also to explain the Contra&ions in the Manuscripts, and to make the reading and consulting of them, when necessary, more easy to Persons not used to antient Records.

A strait Lint over a Vowel denotes the Omission of the Letter m or n following:

qua ¥ - quam antiq1 - antiquam hoiu ¥ - hominum

i. The Six Volumes printed by an Order of the House of Lords of Great Britain, 9 March 1767, and intituled, Rotuli Parliamentorum ut et Petitiones et Placita in Parliamento, contain various Parliamentary Matters from 6 Edw. I. to 19 Hen. VII. Original Petitions in Parliament from the Time of Edw. I, Entries of Record of Rolls and Proceedings in Parliament in the Time of Edw. I. and II, and Rolls of Parliament from 4 & 5 Edw. II, to the End of the Reign of Edward IV, are still preserved in the Tower of London, among which are many Matters not noticed in those printed Volumes. Previous to Edward III. the Contents of the Rolls are miscellaneous and irregular. From 13 Edw. III. to the End of the Reign of Edw. IV. the Contents of them are generally, but not universally, uniform, and may be thus described. They begin by stating the Time of the Opening of each Session, the declaring the Causes for which the Parliament was summoned, and the Appointment of Receivers and Triers of Petitions.ÑThe Grants of Aids and Subsidies to the King, and the other Proceedings in the several Matters before Parliament, are entered as they took place. All the Petitions of the Commons, relating to Public Matters, and sometimes those of the Clergy separately, with the Answers thereto, are entered at large, as also all the Petitions or Bills presented by private Persons, and the Answers thereto: Many of these Petitions or Bills in the Time of Hen. VI. and Edward IV. are drawn up in the complete Form of Ads.ÑThe Rolls conclude with the Account of the Petitions, or Bills and Answers being read at the Close of the Session, and of the Leave given to the Great Men and Commons to depart.

On the Roll of 35 Edw. I. of which the Entry is preserved in the Vetus Codex in the Tower of London, the earliest existing Record occurs of a Commission granted by the King, for beginning the Business of Parliament in his Absence. It is in the following Form :

Ò Parliaments R. Edwardi sumonitu apud Kart in Odab S£i Hillaf anno Regni sui xxxv'¡.

Ò EDWARD par la grace de Dieu Roi Denglefre, Seign' Dirlaunde & Dues Daquitaine a touz noz foialx & loialx Prelatz, Contes, Barons, Procurours, & autres q sont venuz a Cardoill p nre somonse pr estre illueqs a nre Parlement a ces Oytaves de la Seynt Hilleyre, Saluz.

The next known existing Record of a similar Commission is found on the Parliament Roll in the Tower, 13 Edw. III. Part II. The following is a Copy of the Commencement of that Roll, and of the Royal Commission entered thereon, for the beginning and continuing of Parliament.

2. The Acts of Parliament inrolled, or, as they have been usually termed, Rolls of Parliament, which are preserved in the Chapel of the Rolls, London, commence with Richard III. and are continued to the present Time. The General Contemporary Title or Indorsement of each Roll is Ò Rotulus Parliamenti Ó &c. specifying the Year of the KingÕs Reign. But some of these Rolls are otherwise indorsed; E. g. ÒAds of Parlia.ment inrolled.Ó Ò Irrotulamentunn Parliamenti.Ó Ò Ada Parliamenti.Ó

From i Ric. III. to the End of Henry VII, these Rolls are very similar in their Contents to those of preceding Reigns, in the Tower, as before described. The Rolls from i Henry VIII. to 25 Hen. VIII. contain a more abridged Account of the Proceedings in Parliament, but appear to include all the Acts passed in every Session, with an introductory and concluding Form to each Act, of its being exhibited and assented to. After 21 Hen. VIII. the Introductory Forms of opening the Parliament, appointing Triers of Petitions, &c. are omitted. After 25 Henry VIII. some of the Acts are omitted, being generally such as are classed in the Printed Editions as Private Acts. In 31 Hen. VIII. the Introduction at the Head of the Roll for the first Time defines the Contents as Statutes made in a Parliament, the Time and Place of which is specified, and makes a precise Distinction between Public and Private Acts, as follows, viz. Ò In Parliamento inchoato, &c. [the Date] communi omnium Dominorum tarn Spiritualium quam Temporalium ac Communitatis Consensu, ac Regie Majestatis assensu, inaditata et stabilita fuerunt hec sequentia Statuta, viz. Actes Publicke :Ó Then follows a List of the Titles ; after that Ò Actes Private,Ó with a List of the Titles : Then follow the several Ads Public and Private, in a regular Series, with this Introductory Form to each; Ò Exhibita est regie Majestati, in Parliamento predi&o, Billa quedam, formam ACtus in se continens,Ó and at the End of each ; Ò Cui quidem Bille perleCte et ad plenum intellede per diCtum dominum Regem ex authoritate Parliamenti predicti sic responsum est.Ó [ Le Roy le veult; or otherwise as the Nature of the ACt requires.] No other Proceedings of Parliament are entered on the Roll. Private ACts as well as Public continued to be inrolled till 25 Eliz., but not all which were passed ; some Private ACts were also inrolled in An. 35 Eliz, but not afterwards. At the End of the Roll is generally subscribed the Name of the Clerk of the Parliament: and sometimes Words are added in the Nature of a Certificate of their Correctness, Ò Examinat p me.Ó Ò Examinat & concordat cum originali.Ó Ò Examinat & certificat, &c.Ó These are the Form and Contents of the Rolls to 1 Car. I.

In the Two Sessions 1 and 3 Car. I. the Rolls were made up nearly in the ancient Form.1 In 16 Car. I, the next ensuing Session, the Roll begins Ò In Parliamento inchoato, &c. [as in 31 Hen. VIII.] sancita, inactitata, ordinata, et stabilita fuerunt sequentia Statuta ut sequuntur, viz. Publique Acts.Ó Then follow the Title and Body of an Act, without any introductory Form, and at the End Ò Cui quidem Bille in se formam Actus continenti perlecte et ad plenum intellecte per dictum Dhum Regem ex authoritate Parliamenti sic Responsum est: R¡ÑLe Roy le veult." Or if a Subsidy Act Ò Le Roi remerciant ses bons Subjets, accepte letir benevo.lence & ainsi le veut.Ó Then follow the Title and Body of another Act, and at the End the like Form of signifying the Royal Assent, and so until all the Public Acts are entered. After which follows an Introduction Ò Item quedam Petitiones privatas personas concernentes in se formam Actus continentes exhibite fuerunt p>dSo Dilo Regi in Parliam p>d, quap Tituli subscribuntur, viz. Private Acts.Ó Then follows a List of the Titles, and at the End of the List, Ò Quibus perledtis 8c ad plenum intellettis, p Dhum Regem de Avisamento et assensu Dho£ Spiritualiu et Temporalifi ac Communitatis in d?o Parliam existen, ac authoritate ejusdem, taliter ut sequitur eisdem gingulatim est responsum, viz. Soit fait come il est desire.Ó No other Proceedings of Parliament are entered on the Roll: Ai the End is written, Ò Concord' cum Original Jo. Browne Cleric. Parliamento^.Ó This Form continues to 31 George II. inclusive. After which the List of the Private Ads, and its introdu&ory and concluding Forms, are wholly omitted.

Õ Sit more fully, Appendix F. post pages lxxvii, Uxviii.

Goa g!e

At the present Day, on Account of the increased Length and Number of the Public Afts passed in Parliament, they cannot all be conveniently entered on one Roll. At the Head therefore of a Roll, which is indorsed, Ç Prima Pars Rotulorum Parliamentorum de Anno Regni Regis Georgii Tertii,Ó [specifying the Tear of the Kings Reign, fife.] is written the following Introduction.

Ò In Parliamento inchoato et tento, apud [Place and Date] communi omnium Dominorum tam Spiritualium quam Temporalium et Communitatis consensu, ac Regia Majestatis assensu, sancita inaftitata ordinata et stabilita fuerunt sequentia hate Statuta: Videlicet.

Publics Acts.

1. An Act [ Title and Date of passing."]

Then follows the Ad at length, and at the End the IVords only of the Royal Assent.

Le Roy le veut.

[or otherwise as the Nature of the Ad requires.]

2. An Act [£ifr. in the same Form exadly.]

On this Roll, and on subsequent Rolls of the same Parliament, indorsed Ò Secunda ParsÓ Ò Tertia ParsÓ &c. K Rotulorum Parliamentorum de Anno Ó &c. as on the First Roll, all the Public Afts of the .Session are in like Manner entered: And at the Bottom of the last Roll, or Part, in the Hand-writing of the Clerk of the Parliaments is the following Certificate. Ò Concordat cum Originali. George Rose Cler Parliamento?.Ó

This Certificate refers to the Original Bills which, having received the Royal Assent in Parliament, became Acts, and are preserved in the Parliament Office at Westminster.

The Acts of the Parliament 49 Geo. III. occupy Fifty-five Rolls.

3. With respeft to the certifying into Chancery of Statutes and Private Acts.ÑPrivate Acts of which Evidence has been required, have been from Time to Time specially certified into Chancery by the Clerk of the Parliaments, in Answer to a Writ issued for that Purpose; in which Cases the Writ, with the Return thereto by the Clerk of the Parliaments, containing the Tenor of the Act, has always been exemplified under the Great Seal. There appears only one Instance of any Aft so certified before 25 Hen. VIII. viz. one of 6 Hen. VIII. and the Aft thus certified is contained in the general Inrollment of its proper Year, as are also several of the Afts certified on subsequent Occasions, as late as 35 Eliz. The Afts thus certified are kept in the Certiorari Bundles, separate from the regular Inrollments of the respeftive Years.

The Praftice of certifying Private Afts into Chancery has not of late Years been uniformly observed, Copies being obtained from the Original Aft in the Parliament Office: The Inconvenience attending this Irregularity has been partly remedied by the Introduction of a Clause at the end of some of the Local and Personal Acts, that the Act shall be printed by the KingÕs Printer, and that a Copy thereof so printed shall be Evidence ; but many Local and Personal Acts are passed without this Clause.

The Mode of transmitting and certifying Statutes into Chancery, in Ireland, will appear clearly from the following Particulars, abridged from the Journals of the House of Lords in that Kingdom, in the Year 1758, vol.iv. pa. 109, 113 & 117.

On the 3d of February 1758, It was 44 Ordered, That a Committee be appointed to inspect into the State of the Parliament Office, and inquire in what Manner the Rolls of Parliament are now kept, and how disposed of.Ó On the 20th of the same Month, the Lords Committees made a Report accordingly : In this Report they stated, that previous to the Year 17x5 the Original Acts, and the Transcripts, of them from Parliament into Chancery, were lodged at the Rolls Office ; and that subsequent to that Period the Acts and Transcripts were lodged in the Parliament Office: and they expressed their Opinion, that all Original Acts ought to be kept in the Parliament Office; and that Transcripts, duly certified by the Clerk of the Parliament, and returned on Writs of Certiorari, ought to be lodged in the Rolls Office; by which means, in case of Accident, the Loss of the Records of one Office might be supplied by those in the other.

Annexed to this Report of the Lords was an Appendix, containing a Report of Me. Lodge, Deputy Clerk and Keeper of the Rolls in Ireland, on the Contents of those Rolls. In this Report the following Particulars are stated :

44 The Parliament Rolls remaining of Record in the Rolls Office of His MajestyÕs High Court of Chancery in Ireland, begin with the Fifth Year of King Henry VI. which Roll hath this Title: 4 Ac! in Parliamento Dtii Regis ten apud Dublin coram Jacobo le Botiller Comit de Ormond Justid ipsius Dni Regis Terras suae Hibemiae, Die Veneris prox post festum SÕ1 Cuthberti Epi et Confessoris anno Regni Regis Henrici sexti quinto.'

Berkeley Mro Rotulo^.Ó

On the 23d of February 1758, the House of Lords came to the following, among other, Resolutions:

Ò That the Parliament Office is the proper Repository for the Original Acts passed in this Realm; and that Transcripts of the said Acts, certified in due Form, ought to be in the Rolls Office, there to remain of Record.

Ò That the antient Usage has been to issue Writs of Certiorari from Time to Time out of the Court of Chancery, requiring the Clerk of the Parliaments to return the Tenor of all Acts: But it does not appear to this House that any such Writ has been issued for this Purpose since the Year 1711.

Ò That it is highly expedient that all Original Acts, of which Transcripts have been duly certified into the Court of Chancery, should be lodged with the Clerk of the Parliaments: That a Writ of Certiorari should be immediately issued requiring the said Clerk to return the Tenor of all Acts, passed in this Kingdom since the Year 1711, into His MajestyÕs Court of Chancery; and that from henceforth a Writ of Certiorari should be regularly issued for the like Purpose at the Close of every Session.Ó

Goa gle

Notwithstanding the foregoing Proceedings, it does not appear that the Measures suggested were carried into Effect. On an Examination made, by two Sub-Commissioners on the Records, in the Year 1806, at the Rolls Office in Dublin, some Rolls of the Acts between 1711 and 1758 were found, but not signed or certified by the Clerk of the Parliament; and it is observable that the Heads or Introductions of those Rolls are cut off. From 1758 to the Time of the Union between Great Britain and Ireland, instead of the whole Body of Acts being certified authentically into Chancery at the End of each Session, as required by the last of the foregoing Resolutions, Copies of each separate Act, uncertified, were delivered into the Rolls Office, and put by without Regularity or Method, and without any Calendar at Index to them being made.ÑSee Report of Searches, by order of the Commissioners on Public Records, 1806: Ordered, by the House of Lords, to be printed 30 June 1807.

n.

With respect to Exemplifications of Statutes from Chancery after they have been transmitted thither, Two Instances will fully explain the Nature of the Proceeding: the one shewing the Mode of sending an Exem.plification by Mittimus to the Court where it is to be used in Evidence; the other giving the exaft Form of Exemplification now in use.

1. In Hilary Term 20 Geo. II. John Murray of Broughton being brought to the Bar of the Court of KingÕs Bench by Habeas Corpus direfted to the Lieutenant of the Tower, a Record was read to him, containing a Writ of Mittimus, with which was sent the Tenour of a Writ of Certiorari direfted to the Clerk of the Parliaments, and also the Return indorsed upon the Back of the Writ. The Certiorari required the Clerk of the Parliaments to send to the King in Chancery the Tenour of an Act indtled Ô An Aft to attaint Alexander Earl of Kellie [and others, among whom was John Murray] of High Treason, if they did not render themselves on or before the 12th Day of July 1746.Õ In a Schedule annexed to this Writ of Certiorari the said Aft was transcribed ; and the Clerk of the Parliaments certified that what was therein above written was the true Tenour of the Aft of Parliament in the Writ expressed. Upon this Occasion the Prisoner, ore tenus, pleaded that he did surrender himself within the Time prescribed by the Aft, and the Attorney General, by Authority from the King, confessed the Truth of the PrisonerÕs Plea; and the Court ordered the PrisonerÕs Plea and the Attorney GeneralÕs Confession to be recorded. The Writ of Certiorari itself was issued from the Petty Bag Office and remains there now with the Tenour of the Aft as transmitted, an Exemplification of which only was sent into the KingÕs Bench.'

2. The following is the Form of Exemplification of an Act, from Chancery. It was used for the Purpose of sending to Ireland an authentic Copy of the Aft, passed in the Parliament of Great Britain, for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland. The usual Inrollment in Chancery of all the Public Afts, passed in the Parliament in which that Aft received the Royal Assent, not having been made up, at the Time when an authentic Transcript of the Aft was wanted, the Tenour of the Aft was transmitted into Chancery by the Clerk of the Parliaments on a Certiorari direfted to him, and the Aft was then exemplified from Chancery, as follows :

Ò GEORGE the Third by the Grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland Defender of the Faith and so forth, To all to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting. We have inspefted our Writ of Certiorari issued out of our Court of Chancery bearing date at Westminster the first day of August in the Fortieth Year of our Reign together with the Return made on the back of the same Writ remaining of Record on the Files of our said Chancery in these Words to wit: George the Third by the Grace of God of Great Britain France and Ireland King Defender of the Faith and so forth ; To our beloved and faithful George Rose Esq' Clerk of our Parliaments Greeting : We being willing for certain reasons to be certified about the Tenour of a certain Aft made and ordained in our Parliament at Westminster in the Fortieth Year of our Reign intituled Ò An Aft for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland,Ó Command You, that the Tenor of the aforesaid Aft with all things relating thereunto under Your Seal distinftly and openly without Delay You send to Us in our Chancery and this Writ. Witness Ourself at Westminster the first day of August in the fortieth Year of our Reign.

We have inspefted also the Schedule annexed to the said Writ remaining likewise of Record on the Files of our said Chancery in these Words to wit.Ñ111 the Session of Parliament begun at Westminster the 24,h day of September in the Year of our Lord 1799 and holden in the 39th and 40th Years of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord George the Third, by the Grace of God of Great Britain France and Ireland King Defender of the Faith and so forth, by the Assent of the Lords as well Spiritual as Temporal and of the Commons and by the Assent of the King's Majesty the following Statute (amongst others) was ordained enacted and established to wit Ò An Aft for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland.Ó The Tenor of which Aft follows in these Words Ò Ann 39¡ & 40¡ Georgii 3'" N¡ 241.

APPENDIX. F.

Observations on Original Acts and Instruments in the Parliament Office at fVeJlminJler, as compared with the Inrollments in Chancery, and the Journals of the House of Lords. Temp. Hen. VII. to Car. I.

THE Instruments in the Parliament Office commencing 11 Hen. VII. consist, in general, of Original Engrossments of Bills or Afts as they passed the respeftive Houses of Parliament and received the Royal Assent. These Instruments are all separate from each other; they are distinguished by Numbers, and tied up in Bundles, each of which ought to contain the respeftive Afts of the several Years, the Titles of which are entered in Calendars kept for that Purpose ; but length of Time has produced some Irregularities and Deficiencies.

When the Bill originated in the Lords, Soit bailie aux Commune is written on the Front, and sometimes also Missus a Dominis, signed by Cler. Pari, and then A cest Bill les Commune ont Assentus: If it originated in the Commons, then Soit bailie aux Seigneurs, and afterwards, A cest Bill les Seigneurs ont assentus: Where any Provisoes or Clauses have been tacked to the Bill as Riders, these are noticed in the Assent of the Lords and Commons to the Bill in a general Manner, ouesq' les Provisions annex ; and sometimes also in the Royal Assent. The Royal Assent or Refusal is indorsed ., and to those which receive the Royal Assent the Name of Henry R. is written by the King at the Top, and in some Instances both at Top and Bottom. Many Erasures and Interlineations appear on these Ads, with Memoranda annexed. In general there is nothing written on any of the Afts to ascertain in what Year or in what Parliament they passed ; they are all tied up separately, as Instruments uncon.nected with each other, otherwise than as being all rolled up together in one Roll of Parchment indorsed with the Year of the KingÕs Reign, and buckled round with a Thong of Leather. ÑMany Instances occur of Acts missing, and mentioned in the Calendar so to be.

The Rolls containing the Inrollment of the Afts of each Year in Chancery, commence with i Ric. III. and are continued to the present Time; on these Rolls the Afts inrolled are entered in a regular Series, numbered progres.sively as they are entered on the Roll, without Regard to the Number of the original Aft at the Parliament Office.

The Journals of the House of Lords do not commence till the First Year of Henry VIII; and the Journals of the Years 4, 5, 14 & 15, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, and 27 Hen. VIII, and 1 Mary, Session 1 and 2, are not preserved. In several Years the existing Journals contain an Index Statutorum or List of Afts passed in each Session.

HENRY VII.

Anno 12 Hen. VII. The Roll in Chancery begins with the Forms of opening the Parliament, Names of Receivers and Triers of Petitions, the Eleftion and Presentation of the Speaker: None of these appear in the Parliament Office. The Instruments in the Parliament Office N¡ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, & 7, answer to N¡ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, & 11, on the Roll in Chancery ; being Chapters 1 to 7 of the Public Afts as usually printed. The A<5 for Fifteenths and Tenths, and the AS for Subsidy, which are numbered 12 and 13 on the Roll in Chancery, are tacked together in the Parliament Office, N¡ 8, and between them is a Slip of Parchment, with the Proviso in Favour of the Colleges in the Two Universities, &c. which is at the End of the Subsidy Aft, No. 13, on the Roll.ÑSee the Printed Parliament Rolls, vol. vi. pa. 519. No. 13, and pa. 521.

Two Schedules with the Names of Commissioners for levying the Subsidy entered on the Roll, in Chancery, as having been annexed to the Subsidy Aft, do not appear at the Parliament Office.

The Bundle in the Parliament Office of this Year, 12 Hen. VII., contains a Letter or Writ on Paper, of which the following is a Copy :

This Bundle also contains Article* of Accusation against Thomas Yotten, the Town Clerk of York, on a Roll of Parchment, apparently incomplete: This does not appear to have been any Parliamentary Proceeding whatever.

The introduftory and concluding Forms to each A ft, Ò Item quedam Billa,Ó &c. and the Conclusion Ò Qua quidem Billa," &c. which during this Period are respectively inserted at the Beginning and End of each Ad on the Roll in Chancery, are never inserted on the Original Ad at the Parliament Office.

19 Hen. VII.ÑThe introdudory Forms of opening of the Parliament, &c. which as usual are on the Roll of Chancery, do not appear on any Instrument at the Parliament Office.

The Ad entered on the Roll in Chancery No. a. pro Principe, is wanting at the Parliament Office. The Act, For the Monastery of St. Saviour of Sion, No. 33. at the Parliament Office, is No. 6. on the Roll in Chancery. This Act provides that if the King shall at any Time during the Parliament &c. make any Covenant by Indentures with the said Convent respecting certain Matters mentioned, that such Indentures &c. shall stand and be as an Act of this present Parliament, and be of like Force, as if they were entered in Parliament, and in the Rolls of the said Parliament remaining of RecordÑNo. 7. on the Roll in Chancery is an Entry of an Indenture on the Subjed alluded to in No. 6. This does not appear in the Parliament Office.

No. 34. in the Parliament Office (a Subsidy Act) is No. 11. on the Roll in Chancery : The Schedule of Names annexed to this Ad is contained in the Parliament Office, in a long narrow Roll, consisting of many Rolls tacked together, and the Order of the Counties is different from what appears on the Roll in Chancery or the printed Copy of it. On the Roll at the Parliament Office several Places are inserted, and the Names of the Commis.sioners appointed crossed through. These are omitted on the Roll in Chancery.

No. 19. on the Roll in Chancery, Chapter 9. of the Public Ads as printed, is missing at the Parliament Office.

No. 24. in the Parliament Office, an Ad for Attainder of Lord Audley and others, is No. 21 on the Roll in Chancery : This Ad, in the Parliament Office, is contained in Two Sheets of Parchment and Two Riders or Provisoes, tacked all together ; One of these Sheets and both the Riders are signed H. R. but no Royal Assent appears indorsed on any of them.ÑIn the Bundle of this Year is the following Letter from the King to the Speaker of the House of Commons, direding the Erasure of the Name of Robert Symson from this Ad. On the Ad, as in the Parliament Office, an Erasure appears accordingly in various Places before the Name of John Watson. In the Roll all is fair, and the Royal Assent is entered.

No. 8. in the Parliament Office is No. 27. on the Roll in Chancery, and Chapter 10 of the Public Afts as printed. The last Proviso to this Aft, in favour of H. Wyatt, was omitted in the old Editions of the Statutes, but was inserted by Cay. On the Roll in Chancery it appears that this Proviso was omitted at first to be entered, and was after.wards inserted in a Rider annexed, and signed Ò Ex'1 per me R. Hatton.Ó

On No. 27. in the Parliament Office, which is No. 32. on the Roll in Chancery, the Royal Assent is written twice.

No. 20. in the Parliament Office, respefting the Staple at Calais, is No. 3. on the Roll in Chancery. Tacked to No. 20. is an Instrument beginning Ò Also where,Ó &c. but which appears to have been a separate Bill, with separate Assent of both Houses and the King. The Royal Assent was first Ò Soit fait come il est desire,Ó but this is run through with a Pen, and Ò Le R. le veut,Ó written instead: This is entered on the Roll in Chancery nu. 33, as a separate Aft, with the latter Form of Assent; and is Chapter 22 of the Printed Afts Ò For Attornies and Faftors at Calais.Ó

The Bundle at the Parliament Office of this Year, 19 H. VII. also containsÑ1.

In the other Copy at the Parliament Office, the Words, Ò till the next Parliament Ó are run through with a Pen, and the Words Òfor ever" added. In this Copy the Word Ò notwithstandingÓ appears : In all other Respefts the Copies are Duplicates of each other.

A Bill respefting Hunting, with tlLe Roy sÕavis era Ó indorsed, is contained in the Bundle of this First Year at the Parliament Office, as also a Recognizance, on Paper, from the Bishop of Coventry and Litchfield. In the same Bundle are also contained two Sets of Provisoes, but to what Afts they belong does not appear, nor are they contained in any Aft of i Hen. VIII. on the Roll in Chancery.ÑThere is also a separate single general Proviso in Favour of the Hanse Merchants, exempting them from the Operation of any Afts of that Session, which does not appear on the Roll in Chancery.

No. 16. in the Bundle of this Year at the Parliament Office, is No. 4. on the Roll in Chancery, and Chapter 4. in the printed List of Private Afts. No. 17. in the Parliament Office, is No. 2. on the Roll in Chancery, and Chapter 2. in the printed List of Private Acts. No. 16. and 17. in the Parliament Office, are both indorsed, Ò Soit fait, fkc. oue les Provisions a y celles annexes.Ó 'l'o No. 17. there are twenty-five Provisoes annexed, in separate Slips of Parchment; to No. 16. no Provisoes are now annexed : It appears, however, that eight of the twenty-five Provisoes annexed to No. 17. belong to No. 16. and these are accordingly so entered on the Roll in Chancery. All these Provisoes are signed Ò Henry R.Ó in the KingÕs Hand-Writing. One is indorsed Ò Le Roi le veut.Ó On the Front of another is written, in a Hand quite different from the Text of the Proviso,

Ò Vacat p expressum ) p me Edum Sutton meum consesum j Dom. Dudley.Ó

But no Notice is taken of this in the Roll in Chancery, where this Proviso is regularly entered in the same Manner as the other Provisoes. On the Face of one of the Provisoes is written, Ò By the King,Ó in the same Hand as the Body of the Proviso.

An. 5, 6, 7 Hen. VIII. Journal wanting in An. 5.

The Afts of the Years 5 Hen.VIII., 6 Hen. VIII., and 7 Hen. VIII. at the Parliament Office, appear to have been intermixed with each other, and afterwards arranged, and their Titles inserted in the Calendar, without Reference to the Roll in Chancery or to the Journals of the House of Lords : The Bundle of the 5th Year contains only ten Afts, the Titles of which appear in the Calendar as being all the Statutes of that Year. On the Roll in Chancery of that Year are nineteen Afts: The nine deficient Afts at the Parliament Office are mixed in the Bundles, and inserted in the Calendar, as of the 6th and 7th Years.

One of the Afts of the 7 th Year, Cap. 5. of the Public Afts, is missing from the Bundle at the Parliament Office, and so marked in the Calendar: And in the Bundle of the 6th Year, No. 28. is an Aft of the 4th Year.

To the Aft of Resumption of 6 Hen. VIII., No. 25. in the Parliament Office, among several other Riders or Schedules annexed was one in Favour of George Earl of Shrewsbury, which, by some Mistake, was omitted to be inserted in the Roll in Chancery when the Aft was there inrolled. See No. 8. on that Roll. To remedy this Defeft, the Original Rider or Schedule, signed with the KingÕs Hand, has been taken from the Instrument at the Parliament Office, and tacked to the Roll in Chancery, with a Reference to the Place where it should be inserted ; and to the Instrument at the Parliament Office is added a Copy of the said Rider or Schedule, with a Notice that the Original was so annexed to the Roll in Chancery.1 * *

None of the Afts of the two Sessions of Parliament, the one holden in 14 & 15 Hen. VIII. and the other in it Hen. VIII. are to be found in the Parliament Office; nor is any Notice taken, in any of the Calendars or Indexes there, of any Afts passed in either of those Years : Nor is there any Journal of the House of Lords for those Years. The Afts, however, are entered on the respeftive Rolls of each Year in Chancery. Several Acts on the Roll of the Session 14 & 15 Hen.VIII. want the Form of the Royal Assent at the End of the Aft; but this is supplied by the very full and explicit Conclusion of the Roll, which states the Royal Assent being given at the End of the Parliament to all the Public Acts, which were read Ò per initia Ó for that Purpose.

The two last Articles on the Roll in Chancery, of the 23d Year, No. 33. and 34 ; No. 33. entitled, Ò An Aft concerning Restraint of Payment of Annates to the See of RomeNo. 34. entitled Ò The Ratification of the Aft restraining the Payment of Annates to the See of Romeare wanting at the Parliament Office. Some remark.able Circumstances respefting these two Articles, and also one in the 2jth Year, shall here be stated.

The first of these, N0.33. is not inserted in the old Editions among the Statutes 23 Henry VIII; but is printed in PickeringÕs Statutes, vol. iv. pa. 247Ñ251 ; and Ruff headÕs Appendix, pa. 117, as Cap. 20 of that Year. It contains, towards the Conclusion of it, a Proviso that the King may, at any Time on this Side the Beginning of the next Parliament, Ò by his Letters Patents under his Great Seal, to be made and to be entered of Record in the Roll of this present Parliament,Ó have Power to declare whether the Aft shall take place as a Statute or not. After the Ingrossment of the Aft on the Roll are added, very unusually, the Forms written on the Bill to signify the several Assents of the two Houses ; viz. Ò Soit bailie aux Communs.Ó Ò A cest Bille les Communs ont assentus.Ó In a different Hand writing, and apparently written some short Time afterwards, the usual Form of the Royal Assent is added;ÑÒ Cui quidem Bille plecte & ad plenum intellecte p dcum Dnum Regem ex assensu & auctoritate plmenti predicti taliter responsutn est; Le Roy le volt.ÓÑThen follows on the Roll. Ò Memorandum quod nono die Julii, anno regni Regis Henrici octavi vicesimo quinto, Idem Dns Rex per lireras suas patentes sub Magno Sigillo suo sigillat, actum predictum ratificavit, et actui illo assensum suum regium dedit, put per easdem literas patentes cujus tenor sequitur in hec verba, magis apte constat.

As before observed, neither the original Act nor the Ratification appear in the Parliament Office.

In the 25th Year of Hen. VIII. the Act printed in all Editions as Cap. 21. of that Year, intituled in the modern Editions, Ò The Aft concerning Peter Pence and Dispensations Ó contains a Power to the King to declare the Time when the Act shall commence, Ò by Letters to be enrolled in the Parliament Roll,Ó and also, a Power to annul the Act by like Letters Patents. In the original at the Parliament Office, these Provisions are contained in a Schedule annexed to the Act; they are not printed in any Edition of the Statutes previous to CayÕs, in which and subsequent Editions they are numbered as Sections 28, and 29 at the Conclusion of the Act. The Words Ò Soit fait come il est desire Ó are written at the Top of the Act; but in the Roll in Chancery, No. 27, the Act is intro- duced and concluded by the usual Forms of a Publick Act, and the Answer is Le Roy le veult; after which is entered a Memorandum similar to that annexed to 23 Hen. VIII. No. 33. except the Date of the Letters Patent, which is Ò 7 April, 25 Hen. VIII.Ó a few Days after the rising of the Parliament ; and then, Ò Rex Oib3, &c.

Teste me ipo apud Westni septimo die Aprilis anno regni nri vicesimo quinto.Ó The Instrument of Ratification does not appear at the Parliament Office.

Many Instances occur, in the Afts 26 Hen. VIII., where no Form whatever of Royal Assent appears on the Instruments at the Parliament Office, but the regular Forms appear on the Roll in Chancery. Several Instances also occur where the Form of the Royal Assent is different on the Roll to that which appears at the Parliament Office.

Commission for giving the RoydlAssent.

In anno 33 Hen. VIII. occurs what is believed to be the First Instance of the Royal Assent being given' by Commission: unless the Proceedings in An. 23 and 25, already stated, may be considered in that Light. It appears by the Journals of the House of Lordsthat the Chancellor produced two A£ts agreed to by the Lords and Commons, one for the Attainder of the Queen and her Accomplices, and the other for proceeding against Lunaticks in Cases of Treason ; each A£t being signed by the King; and the Royal Assent being signified by a Commission under the Great Seal signed by the King, and annexed to both the A£ls. And thereupon the Lords agreed to call for the Commons, that in the Presence of both Houses the Authority of Law may be given to both the Ads, which was done; Ò quod et fadum est.Ó Meanwhile the Commons arrived ; and the Duke of Suffolk made a Report from the Committee ordered to attend the Queen, that she acknowledged hfcr Crime, and prayed Indulgence. This is all that appears on the Journal respeding these two Ads. The Com.mission is not, as in subsequent Cases, given at Length in the Journal, but the original Instrument is preserved at the Parliament Office, to which both the Ads are attached, and the Whole is joined together by the Label which holds the Great Seal. These are preserved in the Bundle, and entered ia the Calendar of the 37th Year, at the Par liament Office, instead of the 33d. The following is a Copy of this Commission:

Ò HENRY £

Henry the Eight, by the Grace of God King of Englonde, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faithe and of the Church of Englonde, and also of Ireland, in Erthe the Supreme Head. To our right trusty and right well beloved the Lords Spuall and Temporall, and to our trusty and right well beloved the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, Greeting : We have seen and pfightlie understood two Adis and Ordinances annexed and affyled to these Presents, agreed and accorded by you our loving Subjedls the said Lords Spuall and Temporall and the said Commons in this our present Parliament assembled, and severally endocyde by you as hath been accustomed ; The one of the said Adis concerning the Attainder of the Queene and other her Complices, and the other concerning a Law and Ordinance divysed for suche Persons which after their Confessions or Conviccions of Treason shall happen to fall mad or lunatick, with diverse Clauses, Articles, and Provisions conteyned in either of the said Adis : And forasmuch as ye our said Subjedls the said Lords and Commons have most humblie desired us, amongst other Things, by the Contents of one of the said Adis concerning the Attainder of the Quene and other her Complices for diuers Respedts and Considerations therein expressed, and for the speedy Execuuon thereof, to put thereunto our Royal Assent by our Letters Patent to be assigned with oure Hande and sealed with our Great Seale, We have therefore at your humble Contemplacion and Desire, caused these our Letters Patent to be made, and have signed and caused the same to be sealed accordingly, and by the same declare and notify, as well to you the said Lords Spuall and Temporall and Commons aforesaid, as to all and singular other our loving Subjedls, that We, in Accomplishment of your humble Desyres, by these presents do putt our Royal Assent to the said Acte and Ordinaunce concerning the Attainder of the Quene and other her Complices therein named, and to all Articles, Clauses, and Provisions therein contained; and also for divers Considerations us moving, do put our Royal Assent to the other said Act dyvised for such Persons as after their Confessions or Conviccions of Treason happen to fall madd or lunatick, and to all Clauses, Articles, and Provisions therein conteyned; and be fully agreed and assented to both the said A£ls: Willing that the said A£ts, and every Article, Clause, Sentence, and Provision therein conteyned from hence.forth shall be of the same Strength, Force, and Effect, as if We had been personally present in the higher House, and had openly and publickly in the Presence of you all assented to the same; Commanding also by these Presents as well our Chancellor of England to seal these our Letters Patent with our Great Seal, and to declare and notify this our Royal Assent, in our Absence in the higher House, in the Presence of you the said Lords Spuall and Temporall and Commons of our Parliament, there to be assembled for that Purpose, as the Clerk of our Parliament to endoce the said A£ts with such Terms and Words in our Name as is requisite and hath been accustomed for the same, and also to enroll these our Letters Patent in the Parliament Roll; and these our Letters Patent shall be to every of them sufficient Warrant in that Behalf; and for more surety hereof we have assigned the said A£ts with our Hand ; and finally declare and will, that after this our Royal Assent passed by these Presents, and declared and notified as is afore.said, that then immediately the said Adis and every of them shall be taken, accepted, and admitted good, sufficient, and pfight, to all Entents, Constructions, and Purposes, and to be put in due Execution accordingly; the Conti.nuance of our Parliament, or any other Use, Custom, Thing or Things, to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.Ó [No Date or Teste.l

These Adis have been printed as Chapters 20 and 21 of 33 Hen. VIII. in all Editions: But the Titles of them do not appear in the Index Statutorum at the End of the Journal of this 33d Year1, in which Forty-four Adis are specified. The Adi respedling Lunaticks having committed Treason [chapter 20.] is on the Roll in Chancery, [nu. 15.] but the Adi for the Attainder of the Queen [chapter 21.] is not found entered on that Roll; nor is the Commission for giving the Royal Assent, though required in the Commission to be entered thereon.1 There are Two Rolls in Chancery of this 33d Year, Duplicates, each containing only the same Twenty-two Ò Public AdisÓ of that Year, and no List of the Private Adis : The Printed Statutes contain Thirty-nine Chapters as Public Adis; but several of them relative to matters merely local or personal; and Ten Private Adis, Three of which are not specified in the Index Statutorum of this Year above mentioned.

1 Vol. I. pa. 176. * Journal, vol. 1. pa. 198.

3 This Adi contains the following Clauses: Ò Be it declared by Authority of this present Parliament, That the KingÕs Rpyal Assent by his Letters Patent under his Great Seal, and assigned with his hand, and declared and notified in his Absence to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and to the Commons, assembled together in the High House, is and ever was of as good strength and force as though the KingÕs Person had been there personally present, and had assented openly and publickly to the same.Ñ And Be it also enacted, That this Royal Assent, and all other Royal Assents hereafter to be so given by the King3 of this Realm, and notified as is aforesaid, shall be taken and reputed good and effectual to all Intents and Purposes, without Doubt or Ambiguity; any Custom or Use to the contrary notwithstanding.Ó

Goa tale

The Index Statutorum of several Sessions in this Reign, does not agree accurately in its Contents, nor in its Arrangement, nor in the Titles of the Ads, either with the Roll in Chancery, or with the Calendar at the Parliament Office. The Index which is at the End of An. 34 8c 35 Hen. VIII.', is distinguished particularly by having, opposite to several of the Articles, Numbers, not in a regular Series, but which tally exadly with the Ads as numbered on the Roll in Chancery. The whole Number of Ads in this Index is Forty-eight; of which Thirty-six only are on the Roll in Chancery, and distinguished in this Index Statutorum by Numbers accordingly ; the litles very nearly, but not exadly agreeing. The Calendar of the Ads, and the corresponding Bundle in the Parliament Office for this Year also enumerate and contain Forty-eight Ads; but of these there are Two Numbers 37 and 47 in the Calendar, concerning some Estates of the Countess of Devon and Earl of Hertford, which do not appear either in the Roll in Chancery or in the Index Statutorum in the Journal; while Two which are contained as well on the Roll, No. 3, 4, as in the said Index, No. 12, 13, are omitted in the Calendar and Bundle at the Parliament Office: These are the Ads for the Subsidy of the Temporalty and of the Clergy. A further Instance of Inaccuracy is, that this Bundle does adually contain a Subsidy Ad of some preceding Year, but which is not noticed in the Calendar.

In Anno 35 Hen. VIII. all the Ads appear to have been passed by Commission. The Commission, and also the Ads which received the Royal Assent thereby, were required to be enrolled in the Parliament Roll *. But this Commission does not appear on the Roll in Chancery, nor is the Original to be found in the Bundle of that Year at the Parliament Office. The Royal Assent appears at the Top of the Front of the Ads, some of which have also the Royal Sign Manual at the Top, but some of them are without it; though the Omission of that Sanction appears unusual before this Time. The Acts are all separate, and no Intimation appears upon any of them of their having received the Royal Assent by Commission.

In the Journal of the Thirty-eighth Year, the last of King Henry the EighthÕs Reign, there appears a Commission Õ to give the Royal Assent to the Attainder of the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Surrey; as also an Entry of the Assent being given by the Commissioners, in the Presence of the Lords and Commons accordingly. There is no Roll in Chancery of the Parliament of this Year; and this appears to have been the only Ad passed in that Session, as the King died next day, and the Parliament was dissolved. The Commission, and the Ad for the Attainder annexed, are preserved in the Parliament Office, in the Bundle, and entered in the Calendar, of the Thirty-seventh Year. At the Bottom of the Commission, on the Left Hand, appears the KingÕs Sign Manual, remarkably fair. At the Top of the Ad are written the Words of Royal Assent Ò Soit fait Ó &c. But the Sign Manual is not upon the Ad.

MARY.

In the First Year of Queen Mary, Sess. 2. the Duke of Norfolk applied to make void the Ad of Attainder passed, as above mentioned, in 38 Hen.VIII., and an Ad was passed for that Purpose. See No. 34. on the Roll, 1 Mary, in Chancery ; and No. 27. of the Ads of that Year, in the Parliament Office ; the latter is thus endorsed : Ò Certificat in Cancellaf Dne nre regine xij¡ die Decembr A0 regni Regine Marie primo.Ó The Session ended on December 6. The Ad was not specially certified by itself into Chancery, nor otherwise than in the Parliament Roll of that Year, which is signed Ò Examinat et Certificaf p me Franciscum Spelman Cler Parliamento^.Ó Several other original Ads of this Year are indorsed with the Word Ò Certificat,Ó only. There is no Journal of this Session. The Contents of this Ad are important, in a general view, with relation to the Ratification and Evidence of an Ad of Parliament. It is classed in the later printed Editions as Cap. 13. of the List of Private Ads of 1 Mary, Sess. 2: but has never been printed at length in any Edition of the Statutes. The following is copied and abridged from the Roll in Chancery, which has been compared, and found to agree with the Original in the Parliament Office.

Ò In most hble wise sheweth unto your Highness, your humble and obedient Subjed and Suppliant, Thomas Duke of Norfolk; That where in the Second Session of the Parliament holden the 38th year of the Reign of your most noble Father K.

Ò Soit fait come il est desire:Ó And forasmuch, most gracious Sovereign Lady, as the Offence wherewith your said Suppliant and Subject was charged and whereof he was indited was for bearing of Arms which he and his Ancestors heretofore of long Time and Continuance had borne, as well within this Realm as without, and as well also in the Presence of the said late King as in the psence of divers of his pgenitors, [&c :] And forasmuch also as the said late King departed from this transient World in the Night next following after that the said Commission doth bear Date; and that by the Words contained in the said Commission it appeareth that the said late King did appoint the said Commissioners to give His MajestyÕs Royal Assent to the said Bill, having no Words in the same whereby it may appear that the said late King did himself give his Royal Assent to the said Bill, and for that also the said Commission was not signed with his Highness* Hand, but with his Stamp, put thereunto in the nether Part of the Writing of the said Commission, and not in the upper Part of the said Commission as His Highness was accustomed to do ; nor that it appeareth of any Record that the said Commissioners did give his Royal Assent to the Bill aforesaid j therefore all that was done by virtue of the said Commission by the said Commissioners concerning the giving of the said late KingÕs Royal Assent and Consent was clearly void in the Law, and made not the same Bill to take effect or to be an A cl of Parliament, nor Your GraceÕs said Subject thereby is not nor yet standeth as a Man attainted in the Law: All which notwithstanding, divers and sundry psons, taking Occasion by the Colour of the said Bill so assented unto as is aforesaid, do publish, say, and affirm, that Your HighnessÕ said Subject and Suppliant standeth and remaineth attainted of High Treason, to his great Slander, Infamy, and Dishe.rison : and over that the said Persons by sinister Means and Pradices have obtained certain Exemplifications under Your HighnessÕ Greate Seal of England to be made, of the said Bill only, as a Bill fully assented unto, as well by the said late King as by the Lords and Commons in the said Parliament assembled, making no mention in the said Exemplification of the same Commission (althoÕ the same be affiled and annexed unto the same Bill, and made as Parcel of the Record and a Demonstration of the whole Truth of the Matter) nor of any the Circumstances thereof: By the Means whereof, and other such like Praftices, which the Persons aforesaid do not cease daily to attempt, althoÕ the said Bill remaineth in very Deed as no Act of Parliament, but as a Bill only exhibited in the said Parliament, and only assented unto by the said Lords and Commons, and not by the said late King, for the Considerations aforesaid, yet the same might happen hereafter by reason of the said Exemplifications, and such like untrue Praftices, to be taken for a good and perfeft Aft, contrary to all Truth, whereby your said Suppliant and his Posterity may be hereafter in some Peril and Danger to be disinherited and shall be the less able to serve Your Highness and this Realm, if some convenient Remedy for the same, in this Time that the said untrue Praftices do rise and manifestly appear in the Conscience and Knowledge of them that be now living, be not therefore had and declared by Authority of Parliament: For the true and perfeft Declaration whereof it may please Your Highness that it be declared by the Authority of this present Parliament, That the Law of this Realm is and always hath been that the Royal Assent or Consent of the King or Kings of this Realm to any Aft of Parliament ought to be given in his own Royal Presence, being personally present in the Higher House of the Parliament, or by his Letters Patent under his Great Seal, assigned with his Hand, and declared and notified in his Absence to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons assembled together in the Higher House, according to the Statute made in the xxxiij'1 Year of the Reign of the said late King Henry the Eighth in that Case ordained and provided'; and that the said pretended Aft,whereby it is supposed your said Suppliant to be attainted, is by the common Laws of this your Realm void and of none Effeft, and by the Authority abovesaid shall be taken, adjudged, and deemed, to be no Aft of Parliament, and that it never took any Effeft as an Aft of Parliament, and that the same, by the Authority of this Aft, to all Intents and Purposes, is and shall be of no Value or Effeft, for the Causes aforesaid.

And be it further enafted, that all and singular Exemplifications heretofore had, made, obtained, or exemplified, at the Suit, Request, or Petition of any Person or Persons, or hereafter to be made, had, or exemplified, under the Great Seal of England, of the Tenor of the said pretended Aft, and wherein no Mention is or shall be contained or made of the Tenor of the said Commission and of the Entry of the Words of the Royal Assent entered by Authority ot the said Commission, shall be utterlie void and of none Effeft, and shall not be pleadable or answerable in any Court or Courts of Your Highness, Your Heirs or Successors, or elsewhere.

CHARLES, I.

Anno 1 Car. I.- In the Parliament Office all the Afts of this Session, nine in Number, are fastened together by means of a Label passed through the Bottom of all the several Rolls and Sheets of Parchment on which the Afts are respeftively written, and also through the Bottom of the Commission for giving the Royal Assent. Attached to this Label is the Great Seal; and the Grant of the Subsidy by the Clergy in Convocation is also authenticated ('

by the Seal of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Attestation of a Notary Public. The Afts are in separate Rolls or Sheets of Parchment, but are united by Means of the Commission and the Label thereto. They are written very badly, except that for the Subsidy of the Clergy, and have many Erasures, Interlineations, and Riders. On the Roll of this Session in Chancery, which appears to have been made up with great Care and Accuracy, the Commission is entered at length, and the Afts are very fairly engrossed. The Roll is signed H. F.Isjnge; but without any Words or Form of Certificate.

by R. Tottell, 1572; with the following Title :

Ò In this Voi.ume are contained all the Statutes from the tenrhe yere of King Henrie the Sixt, to the xiiii. yere of our moste gracious and soueraygne lady Queene Elysabeth; made and established in her Hignes Realme of Ireland,Ó

The Preface begins with Reflections on the State of Ireland, and the Necessity of Laws to restrain Licentiousness and prevent Ignorance, &c.

Ò Which things the Right Honorable S' Henry Sidney, Knight of the Honorable Order, Lord President of Wales & late Lord Deputie of the said Realm of Ireland, well perceiving & finding that the Remedying of this Mischief, which is the cause and worker of al the rest, would take away the Effeft thereof, caused all the Justices of both the Benches with the Chief Baron of the Escheker & the Master of the Rolles of the said Launde to confer together for the Coppying out and examining of all such Statutes as then were of Record & not published, which at his comandement they did, and delivered the same perfeftly written & examined with all their hands subscribed to every one of them: And then he (ever mindful to further the good state of the said Commonwelth) brought those Statutes over into England, and conferred with the Right Honorable S' W.Cecill Knight of the Order of the Garter, Lorde Burligh, & I.orde Hyghe Treasorer of Lnglande for the imprinting of them, with whose advyse & assent they were committed to the printe & now for thy benefite [the ReaderÕs] finished & set forth.Ó

2. Extract from the Preface to Sir Richard Boltoris Edition of the Irish Statutes, printed in Dublin 1621; with the following Title:

Ò The Statutes of Ireland; beginning the Third Year of King Edward the Second, and continuing until the Parliament begun in the eleventh Year of the Reign of our most gratious Sovereign Lord King James, and ended in the thirteenth Year of his Reign of England, France, and Ireland. Newly perused and examined with the Parliament Rolls: and divers Statutes imprinted in this Book, which were not formerly printed in the Old Book.Ó

The Preface is addressed to Ò S' Oliver SÔ John Knight Lord Deputie General of Ireland : Ó After some introductory Sentences respecting the Necessity of Laws and Statutes in general, it proceeds thus:

Ò And now, Right Honourable, considering that many good Statute Lawes of force in this kingdome were neuer hitherto imprinted, and (upon search) finding that, for want of imprinting, many others are perished and lost, in those troublesom and miserable times of rebellion, which have beene in this kingdome, and finding also by experience that the printed Books of those Statutes which were formerly printed are so few that there be not sufficient to furnish only the praCtisers and Judges of the Law; so as both the comon people and some of the Professors of the Law, yea the Judges themselves, did want the ordinarie means to attaine to the knowledge of the Statute Lawes, and were constrained verie often to have recourse to the Parliament Rolls; and finding also by daily experiences that Justices of Peace, Sheriffs, Constables, and other Officers fall short in the execution of their Offices to the great Detriment of the Common wealth, which defeCts I suppose to be chiefly occasioned by want of knowledge of the Statutes: &c. &c. - - - I resolued with my selfe (for the generall good of this Kingdome) to peruse all the Parliament Rolls which are extant, and to extraCt out of them all such Statute Laws as were generall or concerned the general good of the Common wealth, which I did accordingly: And, after your Lordships perusall of them, the same were (by your Lordships direction) againe perused by the Chiefe Judges and Master of the Rolls & by them allowed & thought fit to be imprinted, together with so many of the Statutes formerly printed as were not by express Words repealed in the last Parliamet. Howbeit some few of those Statutes which were formerly printed are by the Alteration of Times growen out vse; and although the same be not in expresse Wordes repealed by any later Ad, yet (in mine own opinion) many of those Statutes & especially those concerning Marchiors, and all Statutes that make markes of differences bewteen the English and Irish, as that of shaving the beard upon the upper lippe, and the distindions betweene Irish Enemies and English Rebells, and of persons amesnable and not amesnable to the Lawe, are by implication & good construction of the Statutes of 33 Hen.VIII. 3 & 4 Ph. & Ma. & 11 Eliz. repealed as absolutely as if the same had been by plaine and expresse words. For now Irish are no Enemies but have the absolute freedome of Subjeds, and the full benefite of the lawes; and all Ireland is now devided into Counties, and the KingÕs Writ doth now runne into all the parts thereof, so as now every Man is amesnable to the Law & may be punished for any Offence whatsoever by the ordinarie course of comon Justice ; Yet neverthelcsse the said Judges & Master of the Rolls thought fit, that those Statutes that had been formerly printed, and were not expressly repealed should be printed againe, and that for two reasons; the one lest per- adventure any should unadvisedly taxe me of partialitie that matters of great moment were omitted, and matters of lesse consequence published; and the other was that although the said Statutes be out of use or determined at this day, yet the same may well serve for an historical use; whereby the Judicious Reader may partly disceme both the State of the Church and Common Wealth in those times.Ó

3. From the Journals of the House of Lords in Ireland.

Die Martis, 20¡ Aprilis 1762¡.

RESOLVED, That an humble Address be presented to his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant, to desire His Excellency will be pleased to give Directions, that the Statutes at Large of this Kingdom be forthwith printed and published under the Inspection of the Lord Chancellor and Judges; and that, as an Encouragement to the Printer, a Copy thereof be given to each Member of both Houses of Parliament.

Ordered, That the Lord Viscount Jocelyn do attend His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant with the said Address.

Die Martis, 27Ò Aprilis 1762¡.

The Lord Viscount Jocelyn acquainted the House, That in Obedience to their LordshipsÕ Order he had attended His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant with their Address of the 20th Instant; to which Address His Excellency was pleased to give this Answer: Ò I will not fail to give the proper Orders, that the Resolutions of the House of Lords may be carried into EffeCt.Ó

4. Address to the Reader, prefixed to the Edition of the Statutes of Ireland :

Published by Authority in 1765.

As this Edition of the Ads,.passed in the several Parliaments held in this Kingdom, may be considered as a Public Work, in part obtained at their Expence, and which could not have been executed without such Assistance ¥, it may be proper to shew the Necessity of this Undertaking, from the present State of the Printed Statutes in Ireland; and also the Advantages proposed by what is now done, in attempting to supply former Defeds, and to render this Impression useful and commodious to the Reader.

The Irish Statutes now in Print, consist of those colleded by Sir Richard Bolton, in one Volume in Folio, printed in 1621, by the Society of Stationers, then Printers to His Majesty, reprinted by Benjamin Tooke, [Printer to His Majesty] in 1678, with the Addition of the subsequent Ads to the Session of the 17th and 18th of King Charles the Second inclusive : from which Time to the Revolution no Parliament was held in Ireland. To this Impression was annexed a thin and incompleat Index, and it has been since reprinted in 1723, without any Additions.

The several A£ts which passed in the Reigns of King William and Queen Mary, and those of Queen Anne and the succeeding Kings, were printed by the KingÕs Printers, at the Close of each respective Session, in different Volumes, of different Sizes, and in different Types, without Indexes or any Aid to find the Contents or even the Titles, but by inspeding the Volumes of the Sessions in which they passed ; which Volumes were become too numerous for Use, and even those so dispersed, that at present compleat Sets are with Difficulty to be procured to answer the Purposes of Justice, especially at the Assizes held in the several Counties.

These Considerations, it is presumed, induced the House of Lords to address his Excellency the Earl of Hallifax, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, by their Resolutions of the 20th April 1762, to give Diredions Ò That the Statutes at Large of this Kingdom be forthwith printed and published, under the Inspedion of the Lord Chancellor and Judges; and that as an Encouragement to the Printer, a Copy thereof be given to each Member of both Houses of Parliament.ÕÕ In consequence whereof his Excellency, by his Order, dated the 27th of April 1762, direded Hugh Boulter Primrose Grierson, His MajestyÕs Printer General in this Kingdom, to print and publish the said Statutes at Large, under the Inspedion of the Lord Chancellor and Judges; and to cause a Copy thereof to be given to each Member of both Houses of Parliament.

Which Order being signified to the Lord Chancellor and Judges, they were pleased to approve of a Specimen of the Paper, Size, and Type to be made use of on the occasion ; and their Lordships were farther pleased to honour the Editor with their Appointment to carry their Diredions into Execution.

The Ads as before printed by the KingÕs Printers, having received the Sandion of the Courts of Justice as the Statute Law of Ireland, the Editor considered them as Authentic, and made them the Copy from which he printed, without Variation, save that where he, on reading, apprehended Errors of the Press, he had recourse occasionally to the Records now in the Office of the Rolls, and from thence redified those Errors j the collating them at large being thought needless, and rather a matter of curiosity, which would have been attended with very great Expence.

The Statutes in this Colledion are ranged in order of Time, including all whose Titles are mentioned in any of the former printed Statutes though not there printed at large, distinguishing, however, the Ads or Parts of Ads expired or repealed, by a smaller sized Type; except in some few Instances where Ads have been repealed in part, of which due Notice is given in the Margin.

The Ads whereof the Titles only were mentioned in the Statutes of former Impressions, have been copied at large for this Work, from the Original Records; some Instances there may be of Rolls, before the Reign of Queen Elizabeth (but not since) with the Titles of Ads of Parliament not before printed, which the Editor did not think himself authorized to insert as Part of the Statutes of Ireland ; they never having received the Sandion of being printed by Authority, or even mentioned in any Statute so printed, nor authenticated by judicial Determinations.

The Editor was aware, that the inserting expired or repealed Ads at large, would increase the Bulk of this Colledion; but it is hoped the Public will dispense with that Inconvenience, as they may afford light, and be useful for the construdion of subsisting Laws; and will remain curious and authentic Documents in the Public History of this Kingdom.

It has been usual, especially of late Years, to insert in the same Ad different matters not expressed in the Title of such Ad; this has been the Case particularly in those intitled Ò Ads for Amendment of the LawÓ ; which has rendered it difficult to find the several Clauses when wanted. To remedy such Inconvenience, the Editor has, besides the general Index, added, but in a different Charader, to the Table of the Titles of those Ads, the different Matters therein contained.

Indexes are absolutely necessary to Works of this kind; the Editor has therefore endeavoured to make his general Index to this Colledion useful and complete.

The Ads of Settlement and Explanation though relating to a great part of the Landed Property in Ireland, may be considered as a separate Code of Laws, and as such rather to be consulted on particular Occasions, than as Part of the general Statute Law. The Editor has therefore added a separate Index for the Reader, turning to the several Matters contained in those Ads.

The short Abstrads and References in the Margin, will, it is hoped, be found accurate; and upon the Whole, the Editor is not conscious of having omitted any Care or Pains in discharge of the Trust he has been honoured with ; and hopes this will, upon Perusal, be found a corred and useful Edition of the Statutes at Large, agreeable to the Intention of that respedable Authority, at whose Desire this Work was ordered and undertaken.

In the same Manuscript, and in some others, there is a similar Precept for the Publication of certain Statutes enaded by a Parliamentary Commission in 1432.3 This Precept is in the following Words:

¥In the Edition 1566, these Statutes are placed between those of a Parliament in July 1426, and those of a General Council in March 1427, without any appropriate Date ; having prefixed to them, the first or introdudlory Part of the abovementioned Precept, but without its conclusion. In the Editions 1597 and 1681, the Precept is altogether omitted, and the Statutes are given as a Continuation of those of the Parliament 1426.

IT was Provided in the Court of our Lord the King, holden at Merton on Wednesday the Morrow after the Feast of St. Vincent, the 20"" year of the Reign of King Henry the Son of King John, before [William ÔJ Archbishop of Canterbury, and [other his Bishops and SuffragansÕ] and before the greater part of the Earls and Barons of England there being assembled, for the Coronation of the said King, and Hellianor the Queen, about which they were all called; [where J] it was treated for the Commonwealth of the Realm upon the Articles underwritten ; thus it was provided and granted, as well of the foresaid [Archbishops,*] Bishops, Earls and Barons, as of the King himself and others.

FIRST, Of Widows which after the Death of their Husbands are deforced of their Dowers, [and cannot have their Dowers or Quarentine Õ] without Plea, [Ô whosoever deforce them of their Dowers or Quaren- tine of the Lands, whereof their Husbands died seised, and that the same Widows after shall recover by Plea; they that be convift of such wrongful Deforcement shall yield Damages to the same Widows ;6] that is to say, the Value of the whole Dower to them belonging, from the time of the Death of their Husbands unto the Day that the said Widows, by Judgement of our Court, have recovered Seisin [of their Dower, &c.7] and the Deforcers nevertheless shall be amerced at the KingÕs Pleasure.

ALSO, From henceforth Widows may bequeath the [Crop of*] their Ground, as well of their Dowers as of other their Lands and Tenements, saving to the Lords [of the Fee,] all such Services as be due for their Dowers and other Tenements.

Punishment in cases of Reditseisin.

ALSO, If any be disseised of their Freehold, and before the Justices in Eyre have recovered Seisin by Assise of Novel disseisin, or by confession of them which did the Disseisin, and the Disseisee hath had Seisin delivered (') by the Sheriff, if the same Disseisors after the Circuit of the Justices, or in the mean time, [have disseised'] the same Plaintiff of the same Freehold, and thereof be convift, they shall be forthwith taken and committed, and kept in the KingÕs Prison until the King hath discharged them, by Fine or by some other Proceedings mean. And this is the Form [how such convift Persons iifsuchCascf shall he punished;Õ] when the Plaintiffs come into the Court of our Lord the King, they shall have the King's Writ direfted to the Sheriff, in which must be contained [the Plaint of Disseisin framed upon the Disseisin :4] And [then5] it shall be commanded to the Sheriff, that he, taking with him the Keepers of the Pleas of the [KingÕs] Crown, and other lawful Knights, in his proper Person, shall go unto the Land or Pasture, whereof the Plaint hath been made, and that he make before them, by the first Jurors, and other Neighbours, and lawful Men, diligent Inquisition thereof; and if [they6] find him disseised againÈ as before is said, then let him do according to the Provision aforementioned ; but if it be found otherwise, the Plaintiff shall be amerced, and the other shall go quit; neither shall the Sheriff [execute7] any such Plaint without special Commandment of the King. In the same manner shall be done [to *] them that have recovered their Seisin by Assise of Mortdauncester; [and so shall it be of all Lands and Tenements recovered in the KingÕs Court by Enquests,Õ] if they be disseised after by the first Deforceors, against whom they have recovered any wise by Enquest.

ALSO, Because many great Men of England, which have infeoffed Knights and their Freeholders of small Tenements in their great Manors, have complained that they cannot make their Profit of the residue of their Manors, as of Wastes, Woods, and Pastures, whereas (,0) the same Feoffees (") have sufficient Pasture (Ó) as much as belongeth to their Tenements; (Ó) It is provided and granted ; That whenever such Feoffees do bring an Assise of Novel disseisin for their Common of Pasture, and it is knowledged before the Justicers, that they have as much Pasture as sufficeth to their Tene.ments, and that they have free [Egress and Regress '*] from their Tenement unto the Pasture, then let them be contented therewith ; and they on whom [it was com.plained Ó] shall go quit [of as much as ,6] they have made their Profit of their Lands, Wastes, Woods, and Pastures; And if they alledge that they have not suffi.cient Pasture, or sufficient Ingress and Egress according to their Hold, then let the Truth be inquired by As.sise ; And if it be found, by the Assise, that the same Deforceors have ('7) disturbed them of their Ingress and Egress, or that they had not sufficient Pasture, as before is said, then shall they recover their Seisin by

view of the Inquest: so that by their Discretion and Oath the Plaintiffs shall have sufficient Pasture, and sufficient Ingress and Egress in form aforesaid; And the Disseisors shall be amerced, and shall yield Da.mages, as they were wont before this Provision. And if it be certified by the Assise, that the Plaintiffs have sufficient Pasture with (') Ingress and Egress as before is said, let the other make their Profit of the residue, and go quit of that Assise.

LIKEWISE, It is provided and granted by the King, that from henceforth Usuries shall not run against any being within Age, from the Time of the Death of his Ancestor, whose Heir he is, unto his lawful Age; so nevertheless, that the Payment of the principal Debt, with the Usury that was before the Death of his An.cestor, whose Heir he is, shall not remain (Õ).

OF Heirs that be led away, and withholden, or mar.ried by their [Parents,3] or by other, with Force against our Peace, thus it is Provided; That whatsoever Lay.man be convift thereof that he hath so [withholden any Child, led away, or married,4] he shall yield to the Loser the Value of the Marriage ; and for the Offence his Body shall be taken and imprisoned until he hath recompensed the Loser, if the Child be married ; and further, until he hath satisfied the King for the Tres.pass ; and this [mustJ] be done of an Heir being within the Age of Fourteen Years. And touching an Heir being Fourteen Years old or above, unto his full Age, if he marry without Licence of his Lord to defraud him of the Marriage, and his Lord offer him reasonable and convenient Marriage, without Disparagement, then his Lord shall hold his Land beyond the Term of his Age, that is to say, of One and Twenty Years, so long that he may receive the double Value of the Marriage, after the Estimation of lawful Men, or after as it hath been offered (6) before, without Fraud or Collusion, and after as it may be proved in the KingÕs Court. And as touch.ing Lords, which marry those that they have in Ward to Villains, or other, as Burgesses, where they be dispa.raged, if any such an Heir be within the Age of Four.teen Years, and of such Age that he cannot consent [to Marriage,] then, if his [Friends7] complain [of the same Lord,'] the Lord shall lose the Wardship, unto the Age of the Heir; and all the Profit that thereof shall be taken, shall be converted to the Use of the Heir being within Age, after the [Disposition9] and Provision of his [Friends,7] for the Shame done to him; but if he be Fourteen Years and above, so that he may consent, and do consent to such Marriage, no Pain shall follow.

IF [an IO] Heir, of what Age soever he be, will not marry at the Request of his Lord, he shall not be com.pelled thereunto ; but when he cometh to full Age, he shall give to his Lord, and pay him as much as any would have given him for the Marriage, before [the Receipt of"] his Land ; and that whether he will marry himself, or not; for the Marriage of him that is within Age of meer Right pertaineth to the Lord of the Fee.

TOUCHING Conveyance of Descent in a Writ of Right from any Ancestor from the Time of King Henry the elder, the Year and Day, It is Provided, that from henceforth there be no mention made of so long Time, but from the Time of King Henry our Grandfather; and this Act shall take Effect at Pente.cost, the one and twentieth Year [of our Reign,] and not afore, and the Writs before purchased shall pro.ceed : Writs of Mortdauncester, of Nativis, and Entre, shall not pass the last Return of King John from Ire.land into England; [and this Aft shall take effeft as before is declared.] Writs of Novel disseisin shall not pass the first Voyage of our Sovereign Lord the King, that now is, into Gascoine; and this Provision shall take his Effeft from the Time aforesaid, and all Writs purchased before shall proceed.

TO the KingÕs Writ of Bastardy, whether one being bom before Matrimony, may inherit in like Manner as he that is bom after [Matrimony,] all the Bishops an.swered, That they would not, nor could not answer to it; because it was direflly against the common Order of the Church. And all the Bishops instanted the Lords, that they would consent that all such as were born afore Matrimony should be legitimate, as well as they that be bom within Matrimony, as to the Succession of Inhe.ritance, forsomuch as the Church accepteth such for le.gitimate. And all the Earls and Barons with one voice answered, that they would not change the Laws of the Realm, which hitherto have been used and approved.

IT is Provided and granted, that every Freeman, which oweth Suit to the County, Trything, Hundred, and Wapentake, or to the Court of his Lord, may freely make his Attorney to do those Suits for him.

CONCERNING [Trespasses'] in Parks and [Ponds Õ] it is not yet discussed; for the Lords de.manded the proper Imprisonment of such as they should take in their Parks and [Ponds,1] which the King denied; wherefore it was deferred.

HENRY, by the Grace of God, King of England, [Lord of Ireland, Duke of Guyan and Nor.mandy, Earl of Anjou,] to his trusty and well beloved [Gerard, son of Maurice '] Justicer of Ireland, Greeting. Whereas certain Knights of the parties of Ireland, lately coming to Us, have informed Us, that when any Land doth descend unto Sisters within our Dominion of Ire.land, our Justices errant in those parties are in doubt, whether the younger Sisters ought to hold of the eldest Sister, and do Homage unto her for their Portions, or of the Chief Lord, and do Homage unto him: And Forasmuch as the said Knights have requested to be certified how it hath been used heretofore within our Realm of England in like case ; At their instance We do you to wit, that, such a Law and Custom [is in England '] in this case ; That if anv, [holdingJ] of Us in chief, [happen to die, having*] Daughters to his Heirs, our Ancestors and We, after the death of the Father, have always had and received Homage of all such Daughters, and every of them in this cast do hold of Us in chief; and if they happened to be within Age, We have [alway had3] the Ward and Marriage of every of them. And if [he"] be Tenant unto another Lord, and not to Us, the Sisters being within Age, the Lord shall have the Ward and Marriage of them all, and the eldest only shall do Homage for herself and all her Sisters ; and when the other Sisters come to full Age, they shall do their service to the Lords of the Fee by the hands of the eldest Sister; yet shall not the eldest by this occasion exad of her younger Sisters, Homage, Ward, or any other Subjeftion, [for they be all7] Sisters, and in manner as one Heir to one Inheritance, if the eldest should have Homage of the other Sisters, and demand Wardship, then the Inheritance should be divided, so that the eldest Sister should be Seig- nioress and [Tenant of Inheritance timul et semel*'] that is to say, Heir of her own part, and Seignioress to her Sisters; which could not stand well together in this case, for the eldest can demand no more than [her Sis.ters,9] but the chief Mease, by reason of her Ancienty. Moreover, [if the elder Sister should take Homage of the younger, she should be as a Seignioress to them all, and should have the Ward of them and their Heirs; which would be'"] none other, but to cast the Lamb to the Wolf to be devoured.

And therefore We command you, that you cause the aforesaid Customs that be used within our Realm of England in this case, ("), to be proclaimed throughout our Dominion of Ireland, and to be straitly kept [and observed.] [In Testimony whereof, &c. I Witness my.self at Westminster, the ninth day of Februarv, in the Fourteenth Year of our Reign.'1]

1 Maurice Fitzgerald, hit * alwayi hath been in our Realm of England 3 should hold * and have

" Heir, altogether and at once of one Inheritance, 9 a younger

*¡ since the eldest Sister is Heir of all the other Sisters, if they die without heirs of themselves, if the could have the tVard of her Sisters or their Children, this would be " as is aforesaid

13 Witness the King at Nottingham the thirtieth Day of August.

* This Title and the Various Readings are from the Old Printed Copies. In MS. Colt. Vesp. B. VII. fo 31. is a Copy beginning Ç Rex,Õ and dated ¥ xiiij. Maii anno regni nostri xxiv.' which in other respefts nearly agrees with the Old Printed Copies. In Hawkins's Edition of the Statutes is a Copy printed as from some Cotton Manuscript beginning Ô RexÕ and ending Ô Anno regni nostri qoadragesimo.Õ In CayÕs Edition of the Statutes is a Copy printed from MS Colt. Claud. D II (fo. irj. b.) beginning ¥ Rex Õ without any Date. These two Copies nearly agree with the Text printed above from the Close Roll ; at does also an Instrument in TottellÕs Statutes, printed in 1538, fã ijS, q ; intituled, Ô Matut' de Homagio capiendo,Õ and beginning Ô Edwardus dei gratia,' but without any Date.

Certificate into Ireland of the Law of England as to Lauds descending to Coparceners.

For Lands holden in Chief of the Kinc, he hath Homage of all the Daughters:

with Ward and Marriage.

For Land

holden of others, the Lord hath Ward and Marriage of all the Daughters : but the eldest only doth Homage and Service.

The eldest Daughter shall not have Homage of the others.

Know Ye, That where within our Realm [of England,] it [was Ô] doubted of the Year and Day that were wont to be assigned unto sick Per.sons being impleaded, [when*] and from what Day of the Year going before unto another Day of the Year following, the Year and Day in a Leap-Year ought to be taken and reckoned [how long it was :*] We there.fore, willing that a Conformity be observed in this be- half every where within our Realm, and to avoid all Danger from such as be in Plea, have provided, and by the Counsel of our faithful Subjects have ordained, That, to take away from henceforth all [Doubt and J] Ambiguity that might arise hereupon, the Day increas.ing in the Leap-Year shall be accounted [for one year,4] so that because of that Day none shall be prejudiced that is impleaded, but it shall be taken and reckoned of the same Month wherein it groweth ; (6) and that Day, and the Day next going before, shall be accounted for one Day. And therefore We do command you, that from henceforth you do cause this to be published afore you, and to be observed. Witness Myself [at Westminster, 8cc.7]

PROVISIONS made by The

i

N the Year of the Incarnation of Our Lord, One thousand j two hundred and fifty-nine, and the Forty-third Year of the Reign of King Henry the Son of King John, there being assembled at Westminster in the Fifteenth of Saint Michael, our said Lord the King and his Great Men, by the common Counsel and Consent of the said King and Great Men, the underwritten Provisions were made by the same King and great Men, and were published in manner following.

OF Doing Suits, unto the Courts of the Great Men and others the Lords of those Courts, It is Provided and with full consent Ordained, That no Man who hath been infeotfed by Deed shall be distrained from henceforth to do suit unto the Court of his Lord, unless he be specially bounden to do suit by the Form of his Deed: Except those whose Ancestors or who themselves have used to do such Suit, before the first Voyage of the said Lord the King into Brittany j from the time whereof there have passed Twenty-nine Years and a half at the time of making this Ordinance ; and in like manner no man infeoffed without Deed front the time of the Conqueft, or by other ancient Feoffment, shall be distrained to do such Suit ¥, unless he or his Ancestors have used to do the same, before the first Voyage of the said Lord the King into Brittany.

And if any Inheritance wherefrom only one Suit was due, shall descend unto many Heirs, as Parceners thereof, he that hath the elderÕs Share of that Inheritance shall do one Suit for himself and his Coparceners j and his Coparceners shall contribute after their Shares, to the doing of that Suit. And in like manner if many shall have been infeoffed of any Inheri.tance wherefrom one Suit were due, the Lord of that Fee shall have but one Suit therefrom; nor can he cxa£t more than one Suit from the said Inheritance, as it hath been used to be done before. And if the Persons infeoffed have no Warrantor or Mean who ought to acquit them thereof, then all of them shall contribute after their Shares, to the doing of that Suit.

And if it happen that the Lords of Courts do distrain their Tenants for such Suit, contrary to this Provision, then upon the complaint of those Tenants they shall be attached to appear in the KingÕs Court at a short day to answer therefore; and they shall have but one Essoign if they be within the Realm; and the Cattle or other Distresses taken upon this occasion shall be delivered to the Plaintiff forthwith, and shall remain delivered until the Plea between them be ended. And if the Lords of the Courts who have made such Distresses, shall not appear at the day whereto they were at.tached, or shall not keep the day given to them upon the Essoin, then the Sheriff shall be commanded to cause them to come upon another day ; at which day if they come not, the Sheriff shall be commanded to distrain them by all that they possess within his Bailiwick, so that he shall answer to the King for the Issues, and to have their Bodies by a cer.tain Day to be prefixed, so that if they should not come upon that Day, the Party Plaintiff may go thence without day ;

KING AND His COUNCIL.

and the Cattle or other Distresses shall remain delivered until those Lords shall recover that Suit by Award of the Court of our Lord the King; and in the mean time such Distresses shall cease : Saving to the Lords of the Courts their Right to recover those Suits in form of Law, when they will sue there.fore. And when the Lords of the Courts shall appear to answer unto the Plaintiffs for such Distresses, if they be there.upon convi&ed, then by the Award of the Court, the Plain.tiffs shall recover against them their Damages, which they have sustained by occasion of the aforesaid Distress. And in like manner, if Tenants, after this Afcl, do withdraw from their Lords the Suits which they ought to do, and which before the time of the aforesaid Voyage and hitherto they have used to do, the Lords of the Courts shall obtain Justice to recover their Suits, together with their Damages, by the same process and dispatch, in respedf of appointment of Days and awarding of Distresses, like as the Tenants do recover their Damages. And this matter of recovering Damages must be understood of the withdrawings done to themselves, and not of the with- drawings done to their Predecessors: Nevertheless the Lords of the Courts shall not recover Seisin of such Suits against their Tenants by Default; as that hath not been the Custom hitherto. And concerning the Suits that were withdrawn before the time of the aforesaid Voyage, let the Common Law have its course, as it hath used to have before.

CONCERNING The SheriffÕs Turn, It is Provided that Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, shall not be obliged to come thither, nor any Men of Religion, or Wo.men, unless their Presence be specially required; but the Turn shall lie holden as it was wont to be in the times of our Lord the KingÕs Predecessors. And where any do hold Tenements in divers Hundreds, they snail not be obliged to come to such Turn except in the Bailiwicks where they shall dwell: And the Turns shall be holden according to the form of the KingÕs Great Charter, and as they were wont to be holden in the times of King John and King Richard.

IT is also Provided that neither in the Circuit of Justicers, nor in the County and Huudred Courts, nor in the Courts Ba.ron, shall Fines be taken of any from henceforth for Fair Pleading, nor for not be ng troubled on that account.

IN the Plea of Dower that is called Unde nihil habit, from henceforth there shall be given Four Days in the Year at the least, and more if it may be conveniently done.

In Assises of Darrein Presentment, and in the Plea of Quare Impedit of Churches vacant, the Day shall be given from Fif.teen Days to Fifteen Days, or from Three Weeks to Three Weeks, according as the Place may be far or near. And in the Plea of Quare Impedit, if the Disturber come not at the first Day for which he shall have been summoned, nor cast an Es3oin, then he shall be attached unto another Day, on which Day if he come not nor cast an Essoin, he shall be dis.trained by the great Distress above mentioned. And if he come not then, upon his Default the Bishop shall be written to, that the Claim of the Disturber shall not obstruft the Plaintiff- for that Term ; saving unto the Disturber his Right at another time, when he will sue therefore.

CONCERNING Charters of Exemption and Privilege, that the Purchasers shall not be impanelled in Assises, Juries, or Recognitions, It is Provided, That if their Oath should be so necessary, that without it Justice could not be administered, as in the great Assise and Perambulations, and where they may have been named as Witnesses in Charters, or Writings of Covenants, or in Attaints or other like Cases, they shall be compelled to swear; saving unto them at another time their aforesaid Privilege and Exemption.

IP any Heir should be under age after the death of his Ancestor, and his Lord have the Wardship of his Lands, if that Lord will not render unto the said Heir his Lands when he cometh to lawful Age, without Plea, the Heir shall recover his Land as from the death of his Ancestor, together with the Damages that he shall have sustained by that withholding from the time of his coming to lawful Age ; and if an Heir at the time of his AncestorÕs death be of full age, and such Heir, apparent and known to be the Heir, be found in the Inheritance, his Chief Lord shall not put him out, nor take or remove any thing therefrom, but shall take simple Seisin only for the acknowledgement of his Seigniory.

And if a Chief Lord do maliciously keep such an Heir out of the Possession, whereby it behoveth him to proceed by an aftion of Mortdancestor or Cosinage, then he shall recover his Damages, as in the aft ion of Novel Disseisin.

NO Man from henceforth shall be permitted, for any man.ner of cause, to make Distresses out of his Fee, nor in the KingÕs or common Highway, except our Lord the King and his Officers.

IT is also Provided, That where Land that is holden in Socage is in the custody of an Heir's Kinsfolk, because the Heirs were within age, those Guardians cannot make Waste or Sale or any despoiling in that Inheritance, but shall keep it safely for the use of the Heir: So that when he shall come to age, they shall answer unto him by a lawful account for the Issues of the said Inheritance ; saving unto those Guardians their reasonable expenses. Neither can the said Guardians give or sell the Marriage of the said Heir, but for the benefit of the Heir himself.

NO Escheator, or Commissioner, or Justice, especially assigned to take any Assizes, or to hear and determine any complaints, shall from henceforth have authority to amerce for Default of the common summons, except the Chief Justice or Justices in Eyre in their Circuits.

IT shall not be lawful for Men of Religion to enter into any ManÕs Fee, without the licence of the Chief Lord of whom the Fee is immediately holden.

CONCERNING Essoins it is Provided, That in the County or Hundred Courts, or Courts Baron, or elsewhere, no Man shall be obliged to swear for the warranting of his Essoin.

NONE but the King from henceforth shall hold Plea in his Court of a false Judgement given in the Court of his Tenants; because such Pleas do especially belong to the KingÕs Crown and Dignity.

IT is Provided also, That if any man's Cattle be taken and unjustly detained, the Sheriff after Complaint thereof made unto him, may deliver them, without let or gainsaying of him who took the said Cattle, if they were taken without Liberties ; and if such Cattle should be taken within Liberties, and the Bailiffs of the Liberties will not deliver them, then the Sheriff, for the default of the said Bailiffs, shall cause them to be delivered.

NO Man from henceforth shall distrain his free Tenants to answer for their Freehold, nor for any matters pertaining to their Freehold, without the King's Writ; nor shall cause his free Tenants to swear against their will: For none can do this without a precept of the King.

IT is Provided also, That if bailiffs who are bounden to render account unto their Lords shall withdraw themselves, and have no Lands or Tenements whereby they may be dis.trained, then they shall be attached by their Bodies ; so that the Sheriffs in whose Bailiwicks they shall be found, shall cause them to come to the rendering of their Account.

Also Farmers during their Farms, shall not make Waste, or Sale, or Exile, in Woods, Houses, Men, or in any thing else belonging to the Tenements which they have to farm; unless they have a special grant in the writing of their Co.venant, making mention that they may do so. And if they do, and be convided thereof, they shall restore Damages in full.

THE Justices in Eyre from henceforth shall not amerce the Township in their Circuit, because all that are twelve years old do not appear before the Sheriffs and Coroners upon Inquests for the Death of Man, or other things pertaining to the Crown ; so that from those Townships there come enough for the making of such Inquests fully.

THE Fine of Murder from henceforth shall not be adjudged before the Justices, where it hath been adjudged to be Mis.fortune only : But the Fine of Murder shall hold place upon those slain feloniously, and not otherwise.

IT is moreover Provided, That no Man who is vouched to Warranty before the Justices in Eyre, in a Plea of Land or Tenement, shall from henceforth be amerced because he was not present, save on the first day of the coming of the Jus.tices: But if the Vouchee be within the County, then the Sheriff shall be enjoined to cause him to come within the third or fourth day, according to the distance of the places, as it was wont to be in the Circuit of the Justices : And if he dwell without the County, then he shall have a reasonable Summons of Fifteen Days at the least, according to the Discretion of the Justices and the Common Law.

IF any Clerk should be arrested for any Crime or Charge that toucheth the Crown, and afterwards by the KingÕs Pre.cept, be let to Bail, or be replevied, so that those to whom he is let to Bail should have him before the Justices, from hence.forth they to whom he hath been let to Bail, or his other Pledges shall not be amerced, if they have his Body before the Justices, although he will not or cannot make answer before them by reason of the Privilege of Clergy.

11 In the Printed Copies this Sentence occurs in a different Place.

AVE do likewise beseech our Lord the King, and with reve.rence advise his piety That for the doing and rendering of justice, he will prefer those Persons, who, seeking not their own ends, but those of God and Justice, will justly quiet the disputes of his People, according to the laudable Laws and Customs of the Realm, and thereby render the Throne of his Royal Majesty strengthened by Justice.

IN like manner We do beseech and advise our said Lord

the King, that he will fully keep and observe the Liberties ¡ u- Chuith> and t^le Charters of Liberties and of the Forest, which he is bound expressly, and by his own Oath, to preserve and keep.

LIKEWISE Our said Lord the King shall provide for the observance of the Grants that he hath hitherto made of his free will, and not by Duress ¥, and shall firmly establish other things, which have been thought necessary by his Council under his good Pleasure. And likewise the Church of England shall be fully restored to her Liberties and Customs which she had and ought to have before the time of these Troubles ; and shall be freely permitted to use the same.

WE Award and Provide, That our aforesaid Lord the King shall altogether remit and pardon all and singular persons, who from the beginning of the present Troubles of the Realm, and by occasion thereof unto this day, have committed any Wrong or Offence against him or his Royal Crown, and who shall come in to his Peace within Forty Days after the publica.tion of this our Ordinance: So that he shall not in any manner, for any cause or pretence, by reason of such wrongs or offences past, take Vengeance of those Offenders; or punish them with Death, or Loss of Limb, or Imprisonment, or Banishment, or Fine, or Revenge; except those hereafter contained in this our present Ordinance.

WE Award likewise and provide that all Places, Rights, Possessions, and other things to the Royal Crown belonging, shall be restored to the Crown and to our Lord the King by those who withhold and occupy them, unless they shall shew that they hold them by a reasonable Warrant from our Lord the King himself, or his Ancestors.

WE Award likewise and provide, that all Writings, Bonds, and Instruments, which the aforesaid Lord the King, or the Lord Edward his eldest Son, or other Liege Men may have made or published hitherto, by occasion of the Provisions of Oxford, or by occasion of the Troubles of the Realm, at the Instance of the late Simon de Montfort Earl of Leicester and his Accomplices, shall be absolutely annulled and quashed, and be altogether holden for nought and quashed. Moreover the A£ls of the said Simon and of his Accomplices, whether judicial or others, and the wrongs thereof, and all Contrails of things immoveable, by them made, while they held their Authority shall be annulled and holden for nought.

HUMBLY beseeching as well the Lord Legate as the Lord the King, that he the Lord Legate will utterly prohibit, under the Penalties of the Church, any Man from holding Simon Earl of Leicester for a Saint or Just One, fo: that he died under Excommunication, according to the Doilrine of Holy Church. And that the vain and foolish Miracles related of him by certain Persons, shall not pass any ManÕs Lips. And that our Lord the King will stri&lv enjoin the same prohibi.tion, under Pain of temporal Punishment.

WE reverently and humbly supplicate our venerable Father the Lord Ottobon Deacon Cardinal of St. Adrian, and Legate of the Apostolic See, that if he shall deem it expedient as well for our Lord the King as for all other of the Realm, both great and small, who have not observed their sworn Charters, to the observance whereof they were all obliged by the Sentence of Excommunication pronounced, and not observed, that they may receive the Benefit of Absolution.

WE likewise beseech and advise that no Man of what Condition soever he be, shall take Corn or any manner of Viftual, or other Goods whatever, under the pretence of borrowing, or the Promise of After-payment, without Leave of those to whom the Goods or Things belong : Saving the approved Customs of the Realm.

TOUCHING London [We commend it,Õ] and ex.hort (*) the King, that he by his Council will provide a Reformation for the State of the City, as concerning their Lands, Rents, Houses and Liberties, and that the same Provision may be made immediately.

First, concerning them that began the war, and yet continue;

Item, they that forcibly and maliciously withheld Northampton against the King; (3)

Item, they that were taken at Kenilworth, which came from the sacking of Winchester, or that otherwhere were against the King, whom he hath not pardoned;

Item, they that warred at Evesham against the King;

Item, they that were at Chesterfield against the King in battle;

Item, they that freely, wilfully, and uncompelled, sent any aid against the King or his Son;

Item, the Bailiffs and Officers of the Earl of Leicester, which robbed their Neighbours, and procured Man.slaughters, House burnings, and other Evils to be done, shall pay as much as their Lands be worth by the space of Five Years; And that they paying their Ransoms, shall have their Lands again, so that if their Lands should be sold, none shall [have4] them, but he that holdeth the same of the Gift of the King, in case he will give so much as a common Purchaser, [and with those terms; that if the Party so redeeming his Land, do satisfy for his whole Land from the beginning, he3 3 shall forthwith have his whole Land: And likewise he that satisfieth for the Half or the Third Part, shall forth.with have the Half, or the Third Part.

But if at the last Term appointed, the Party redeem.ing do not satisfy, the Half of the Lands remaining shall remain to them, to whom they were given by the KingÕs Gift; also the Party redeeming shall be at liberty within that term to sell all or part of his Land, (6) and in like manner to let it to farm.

AND if any have Woods, and will sell them towards their Ransom, he that holdeth the Land by the King's Gift, shall have a competent Servant, that shall receive the Money ; and the Party disherited, which selleth the Wood, must have one in whom he trusteth ; and these two Receivers, in the presence of the whole Shire, shall pay the Money received for the Wood, to them to whom Redemption ought to be given. The Pay.ment of this Redemption must be done by Three Years.

CONCERNING the Earl de Ferris, We award that he be punished by as much as the Value of his Lands shall amount unto in Seven Years :

Knights and Esquires, which were Robbers, and among the principal Robbers, in Wars and Rodes, if

Let them also enquire and fulfil those things, that [shall be ordained of the foresaid Twelve,'] according to (Õ) reasonable and true Estimations, and after as the said Twelve shall think good to be done.

FERMORS that were against the King, shall leese their terms, saving the Right of their Lords, to whom [they pay their yearly Rent; and they that shall have the Farms after the Terms expired, shall render them3] to the true Lords.

CONCERNING Castles builded by the KingÕs Charters, and by his Consent, and yet disherited without his Consent, We award, that after the Ransom paid, within the space of Three Years, the Lord of the Land shall pay within Six Years the Costs which were laid upon them afore [this general Proclamation4] by Consent of the King, or by reasonable Exchange of Land.

But they that held of the EarlÕs Fee, shall only be amerced to the King.

IMPOTENT Men and other, which did no Harm, shall be restored to their Lands without delay, and recover their Damages in the KingÕs Court; Let false Accusers be punished against the King in such wise as he believe them not lightly thereafter; and such Punishment must be done of them as belongeth to them that wrongfully have caused the KingÕs Lieges to be disherited and undone, without peril of Life, Maim.ing, and Disherison ; they that were accused by Malice shall forthwith have again their Lands, and recover their Damages in the KingÕs Court, as is contained in the Article next afore.

IF there be any that will not observe this Award, nor abide the Judgement of [the KingÓ] by his Peers, [all that be such shall be of the Number of the disherited, andll] shall have no Law to recover their Lands.

And if any holding the Lands of any Person disherited, be found rebel to this Award, he shall not be admitted to challenge any Right in the Land or Ransom given him by the King.

Moreover whoso will not agree to this Award, let him be had as Enemy of the King, and his Sons, and of all the Communally. And People and Clergy, as far forth as the Laws and [CommonsÕ*] do permit, shall pursue him as Enemy of the Peace of the Church and of the Realm.

Provisions made at Marlborough in the Presence of our Lord King Henry, and Richard King of the Romans, and the Lord Edward eldest Son of the said King Henry, and the Lord Ottobon, at that Time Legate in England.

IN the Year of Grace, One thousand two hundred sixty-seven, the two-and-fiftieth Year of the Reign of King Henry, Son of King John, in the Utas of Saint Martin, the said King our Lord providing for the better Estate of his Realm of England, and for the more speedy Ministration of Justice, as belongeth to the Office of a King, the more discreet Men of the Realm being called together, as well of the higher as of the lower Estate: ['It was Provided, agreed, and ordained, that whereas the Realm of England of late had been dis.quieted with manifold Troubles and Dissensions; for Reformation whereof Statutes and Laws be right neces.sary, whereby the Peace and Tranquillity of the People must be observed ; wherein the King, intending to devise convenient Remedy, hath made these Adis, Or.dinances, and Statutes underwritten, which he willeth to be observed for ever firmly and inviolably of all his Subjects, as well high as low.1]

WHEREAS at the time of a Commotion late stirred up within this Realm, and also sithence, many great Men, and divers other, [refusing to be justified *J by the King and his Court, like as they ought and were wont in Time of the KingÕs noble Progenitors, and also in his Time ; but took great Revenges and Distresses of their Neighbours, and of other, until they had Amends and Fines at their own Pleasure; and further, some of them [would not be justified!] by the KingÕs Officers, nor [would4] suffer them to make Delivery of such Dis.tresses as they had taken of their own Authority (Ô) ; It is Provided, agreed, and granted, that all Persons, as well of high as of low Estate, shall (6) receive Justice in the KingÕs Court; and none from henceforth shall take any such Revenge or Distress of his own Authority, without Award of [our7] Court, though he have Damage or Injury, whereby he would have amends of his Neighbour either higher or lower.

And upon the foresaid Article It is Provided and granted, that if any from henceforth take such Revenges of his own Authority, without Award of the KingÕs Court as before is said, and be convitt thereof, he shall be punished by Fine, and that according to the Trespass ; and likewise it one Neighbour take a Distress of another without Award of the KingÕs Court, whereby he hath Damage, he shall be punished in the same wise, and that after the Quantity of the Trespass; and nevertheless suf.ficient and full Amends shall be made to them that have sustained Loss by such Distresses.

1 It Òwas Provided and established and with full consent ordained, That [whereas the Realm of England /saving been of late depress l by manifold Troubles and the evils of Dissensions, standeth in need of a Reformation of the Laws and Usages, whereby the Peace and Tranquillity of the People may be preserved, whereto it behoved the King and his luge Men to apply an wholesome Remedy,) the Provisions, Ordinances, and Statutes underwritten, should be f.rm/y and inviolably obtei ved by all the People of the same Realm, as well high at low, for ever.

IF Any, of what Estate soever he be, will not suffer such Distresses as he hath taken, to be delivered by the KingÕs Officers, after the Law and Custom of the Realm, or will not suffer Summons, Attachments, or Execu.tions of Judgments given in the KingÕs Court, to be done according to the Law and Custom of the Realm, [as is aforesaid] he shall be punished in manner afore.said, as one that will not obey the Law, and that accord.ing to the Quantity of the Offence.

And if any, of what Estate soever he be, distrain his Tenant for Services and Customs [being due4] unto him, or for any other Thing, for the which the Lord of the Fee hath Cause to distrain, and after it is found that the same Services are not due, the Lord shall not there.fore be punished by Fine, as in the Cases aforesaid, if he do suffer the Distresses to be delivered according to the Law and Custom of the Realm; but shall be amerced as hitherto hath been used, and the Tenant shall recover his Damages (5) against him.

NONE from henceforth shall cause any Distress that he hath taken, to be driven out of the County where it w as [taken] ; and if one Neighbour do so to another of his own Authority, and without Judgment, he shall make Fine, as above is said, as for a Thing done against the Peace ; nevertheless, if the Lord presume so to do against his Tenant, he shall be grievously punished by Amerciament.

Moreover, Distresses shall be reasonable, and not too great; and he that taketb [great6] and unreasonable Distresses, shall be grievously amerced for the Excess of such Distresses.

THE Great Charter shall be observed in all his Articles, as well in such as pertain to the King, as to other ; and that shall be enquired afore the Justices in Eyre in their Circuits, and afore the Sheriffs in their Counties, when need shall be ; and Writs shall be freely granted against them that do offend, before the King, or the Justices of the Bench, or before Justices in Eyre, when they come into those Parts. Likewise the Charter of the Forest shall be observed in all his Ar.ticles, and the Offenders, when they be convict, shall be [grievously] punished by our Sovereign Lord the King [in Form above mentioned.]

AS touching them that use to infeoff their eldest Sons and Heirs, being within Age, of their Heritage, for to defraud the Lords of the Fee of their Wardships, It is Provided, accorded, and agreed, that by occasion of any such Feoffment no Chief Lord shall leese his Ward. Moreover, touching them that fain false Feoffments of their Lands, which they will lease for Term of Years, for to defraud the Chief Lords of their Wards, wherein it is contained, that they are satisfied of the whole Ser.vice due unto them until a certain Term ; [so 7J that such Feoffees are bound [at8] the said Term to pay a certain Sum [to the Value of the same Lands, or far above ;'] so that after such Term the Land shall return unto them, [or to their Heirs], because no Man will be content to hold it upon the Price ; It is Provided and agreed, that by such Fraud no Chief Lord shall leese his Ward: Nevertheless, it shall not be lawful to them to disseise such Feoffees without Judgment, but they shall have a Writ for to have such a Ward restored unto them ; and by the Witnesses contained in the [Deed'Ò] of Feoff.ment, with other free and lawful Men of the Country, and by the (") Value of the Land, and by the Quantity

of the Sum payable after the Term, it shall be tried whether such Feoffments were made bona fide, or by Collusion, to defraud the Chief Lords of the Fee of their Wards. And if the Chief Lords in such Cases recover their Wards by Judgment (1) the Feoffees shall nevertheless have their A Sion [to recover such Term or Fee, which they had therein,*] when the Heirs come to their lawful Age.

And if any Chief Lords do maliciously implead such Feoffees, faining this Case, namely, where the Feoffments were made [lawful3] and in good faith, then the Feof.fees shall have their Damages awarded, and their Costs which they have sustained by occasion of the foresaid Plea, and the Plaintiffs shall be grievously punished by Amerciament.

IN [a Plea of Communi Custodia,4] if the Deforceors come not at the great Distress, then the said Writ shall be renewed twice or thrice, at such Terms as it may be done within the half year following, so that every time the Writ shall be read in the open County, if the De.forceor be not found before, and there openly be pro.claimed, that he may come at the day limited (3); [so that if6] he absent himself then, [and7] come not to answer within the said half year, [nor the Sheriff cannot get his Body, to have it*] before our Justices to an.swer according to the Law and Custom of the Realm, then as a Rebel, and such a one as will not be justified, he shall lose the Seisin of his Ward; saving to him his A&ion at another time, if he have any right to the same. But in such cases, where the Wardships belong to the Guardians of Wards being within Age, and [where the Guardians demand a Wardship which belongeth to the Heir, or as appertaining to their Inheritance,9] such Heirs within Age [shall not leese their Inheritance10] by the Negligence or Rebellion of their Guardians, as in the case arore rehearsed ; but let the Common Law run in like manner as it hath been accustomed to do.

THEY which be taken and imprisoned for Redisseisin, shall not be delivered without special Commandment of our Lord the King, and shall make Fine with our Lord the King for their Trespass. And if it be found, that the Sheriff delivereth any contrary to this Ordinance, he shall be grievously amerced therefore ; and nevertheless, they which are so delivered by the Sheriff without the KingÕs Commandment, shall be [grievously] punished for their Trespass.

FOR doing Suits unto Courts of great Lords, [or of meaner Persons,"] from henceforth this Order shall be observed; That none that is infeoffed by Deed, from henceforth shall be distrained to do such Suit to the Court of his Lord, without he be specially bound there.to by the Form of his Deed: These only except, whose Ancestors or they themselves, have used to do such Suit before the first voyage of the [said] King [Henry] into [Britain,11] since which nine and thirty years and an half are passed, [unto the time11] that these Sta.tutes were enafted. Likewise from henceforth none that is infeoffed without Deed, from the Time of the Conquest, or (,4) any other ancient Feoffment, shall be distrained to do such Suits, unless that he or his An.cestors used to do it before the said Voyage (IJ). And they that are infeoffed by Deed to do a certain Service, as for (Ò) Service of so many Shillings by Year, to be [acquitted 17 ] of all Service, from henceforth shall not be bounden to such Suits, or other like, contrary unto the Form of their Feoffment. And if any Inheritance, whereof but one Suit is due, descend unto many Heirs, (")as unto Parceners, whoso hath the eldest Part of

And if many Feoffees be seised of an Inheritance, whereof but one Suit is due, the Lord of the Fee shall have but that one Suit; and shall not exaft of the said Inheritance but that one Suit, as hath been used to be done before. And if those Feoffees have no [War.rant1] or Mean which ought to acquit them, then all the Feoffees, according to their Portion, shall be Con- tributaries for doing [the Suit for them.1]

And if it chance that the Lords [of the Fee3] do distrain their Tenants for such Suits, contrary to this AS, then at the Complaint of the Tenants, the Lords shall be attached to appear in the KingÕs Court at a short Day, to make Answer thereto, and shall have but one Essoin therein, if they be within the Realm; and immediately the Beasts, or other Distresses taken by this Occasion, shall be delivered to the Plaintiff, and so shall remain, until the Plea (4) betwixt them be determined. And if the Lords of the Courts which took (5) Distresses, come not at the Day that they were attached, or do not keep the Day given to them by Essoin, then the Sheriff shall be commanded to cause them to come at another Day ; at which Day, if they come not, then he shall be commanded to distrain them by all [their Goods and Chattels] that they have in [the Shire,6] so that the She.riff shall answer to the King of the Issues [of the said Inheritance] ; and that he have their Bodies [before our Justices] at a certain Day limited ; so that if they come not at that Day, the Party Plaintiff shall go without Day, and his Beasts, or other Distresses [taken by that colour,] shall remain delivered, until the same Lords have reco.vered the same Suit by Award of the KingÕs Court: And in the mean time such Distresses shall cease ; saving to the Lords of the Court their Right to recover those Suits in Form of Law, when they will sue therefore. And when the Lords of the Courts come in to answer the Plaintiffs of such [Trespasses/] and be convift there.upon ; then, by Award of the [KingÕs] Court, the Plain.tiffs shall recover against them the Damages that they have sustained by occasion of the said Distress.

Likewise if the Tenants, after this Aft, withdraw from their Lord such Suits as they [were wont8] to do, and which [they did9] before the 'l ime of the said Voyage, and hitherto (IO) used to do ; then by like Speediness of Justice, as be to limiting of Days, and awarding of Distresses, the Lords of the Court shall obtain Justice to recover their Suits, with their Damages, in like man.ner as the Tenants should recover theirs: And this recovering of Damages must be understood of with.drawing from themselves, and not of withdrawing from their Ancestors : nevertheless, the Lords of the Court shall not recover Seisin of such Suits against their Tenants by Default, [as they were wont to do."] And touching Suits withdrawn before the Time afore men.tioned, let the Common Law run as it was wont before time.

FOR the Turns of Sheriffs, It is Provided, That Arch.bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, nor any Religious Men or Women, shall not need to come thither, except their Appearance be especially required thereat for some [other] cause ; but the Turn shall be kept as it hath been used in the times of the KingÕs [noble Progenitors."] And they that have [Hundreds of their own to be kept/3] shall not be bound to appear at any such Turns, but in the Bailiwicks where they be dwelling. And the Turns shall be kept after the Form of the (") Great Charter, and as they were used (l5) in the times of King Richard and King John.

IT is Provided also, That from henceforth neither in the Circuit of Justicers, nor in [Counties, Hundreds, andÕ6] Court Barons, any Fines shall be taken of any

Touching [Heirs which holdl] of our Lord the King in chief, this Order shall be observed; That our Lord the King shall have the first Seisin [of their Lands,1] like as he was wont to have before time; Neither shall the Heir, nor any other, intrude into the same Inheritance, before he hath received it out of the KingÕs Hands, as [the same Inheritance was *] wont to be taken out of his Hands and his Ancestors [in times past.5] And this must be understood of Lands and Fees, the which were accustomed to be in the KingÕs Hands, by reason of KnightÕs Service, or Serjeanty, or Right of Patronage.

IT is Provided, That if Land holden in Socage be in the Custody of the [Friends6] of the Heir, because the Heir is within Age, the Guardians shall make no Waste, nor Sale, nor any Destruction of the same Inheritance ; but safely shall keep it to the use of the said Heir: So that when he cometh to his lawful Age, they shall answer to him for the Issues of the said Inheritance by a lawful Accompt, saving to the same Guardians their reasonable Costs. Neither shall the said Guardians give or sell the Marriage of such an Heir, but to the Advantage of the foresaid Heir: But the next [Friends6] which had the Ward, for all that time that Writs of impleading did not lie, shall have such Wardship unto the Advantage of the Heir, as is said before, without Waste, [Sale,7] or Destruction making.

NO Escheator, Commissioner, or Justicer specially assigned to take (*) Assises, or to hear and determine (') Matters, from henceforth shall have Power to amerce for Default of common Summons, but the Chief Jus.tices, or the Justices in Eyre in their Circuits.

TOUCHING Essoins, It is Provided, That in Counties, Hundreds, or in Courts Barons, or in other Courts, none shall need to swear to warrant his Essoin.

NONE from henceforth, except our Lord the King, shall hold in his Court any Plea of false Judgement, given in the Court of his Tenants ; for such Plea spe.cially belongeth to the Crown and Dignity of our Lord the King.

IT is Provided also, That if the Beasts of any Man be taken, and wrongfully withholden, the Sheriff, after Complaint made to him thereof, may deliver them with.out Let or Gainsaying of him that took the Beasts, if they were taken out of Liberties : And if the Beasts were taken within any Liberties, and the Bailiffs of the Li.berty will not deliver them, then the Sheriff, for De.fault of those Bailiffs, shall cause them to be delivered.

NONE from henceforth may distrain his Freeholders to answer for their Freeholds, nor for any Things touching their Freehold, without the KingÕs Writ; nor shall cause his Freeholders to swear against their Wills; for no Man may do that without the KingÕs Com.mandment.

IT is Provided also, That if Bailiffs, which ought to make Account to their Lords, do withdraw themselves, and have no Lands nor Tenements whereby they may be distrained ; then they shall be attached by their Bodies ; so that the Sheriff, in whose Bailiwick they be found, shall cause them to come to make their Account.

Also Fermors, during their Terms, shall not make Waste, Sale, nor Exile of [House,9] Woods, Men, nor of any Thing belonging to the Tenements that they have to ferm, without special Licence had by Writing of Covenant, making mention that they may do it; which thing if they do, and thereof be convift, they shall yield full Damage, and shall be punished by Amerciament grievously.

The STATUTES of WESTMINSTER; The First.

1 THESE be the A&s of King Edward, Son to King Henry, made at Westminster at his first Parlia.ment general after his Coronation, on the Monday of Easter Utas, the Third Year of his Reign, by his Coun.cil and by the assent of Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and [all] the Commonalty of the Realm, being thither summoned: Because our Lord the King had great zeal and desire to redress the State of the Realm in such Things as required Amendment for the common profit of Holy Church, and of the Realm: And because the State of the Holy Church had been evil kept, and the Prelates and Religious Persons of the Land grieved many ways, and the People otherwise in- treated than they ought to be, and the Peace less kept, and the Laws less used, and the Offenders less punished, than they ought to be, by reason whereof the People [of the Land] feared the less to offend ; the King hath ordained and established these Afts underwritten, which he intendeth to be necessary and profitable unto the whole Realm.

FIRST the King willeth and commandeth, That the Peace of Holy Church and of the Land, be well kept and maintained in all points, and that common Right be done to all, as well Poor as Rich, without respett of Persons. And because that Abbeys and Houses of Religion [of the Land] have been overcharged, and sore grieved, by the resort of great Men and other, so that their Goods have not been sufficient for them.selves, whereby they have been [greatly hindred *] and impoverished, that they cannot maintain themselves, nor such (J) Charity as they have been accustomed to do ; It is Provided, That none shall come to eat or lodge (3) in any House of Religion of any otherÕs Foundation than of his own, at the Costs of the House, unless he be [required4] by the Governor of the House before his coming thither. And that none, at his own Costs, shall [enter and] come to lie [there5] against the Will of them that be of the House. And by this Statute the King intendeth not, that the Grace of Hospitality should be withdrawn from such as need; nor that the Founders of such [Monasteries6] should overcharge, or grieve them by their [often] coming. It is Provided also, that none high nor low, by colour of [Kindred, Affinity, or Alliance,7] or by any other oc.casion, shall course in [any'] Park, nor fish in [any']

IT is Provided also, That when a Clerk is taken [for guilty '3 of Felony, and is demanded by the Ordinary, he shall be delivered to him according to the Privilege of Holy Church, on such Peril as belongeth to it, after the Custom aforetimes used. And the King admonisheth the Prelates, and enioineth them upon the Faith that they owe to him, and for the common Profit and Peace of the Realm, that [they Õ] which be indifted of such Offences by solemn Inquest of lawful men in the KingÕs Court, in no manner [shall be deliveredJ] without due Purgation, so that the King shall not need to provide any other Remedy therein.

IT is Provided also, That nothing be demanded nor taken from henceforth, nor levied by the Sheriff, nor by any other, for the Escape of a Thief or a Felon, until it be judged for an Escape by the Justices in Eyre ; and he that otherwise doth, shall restore to him or them that have payed it, as much as he [or they have 4] taken or received, and as much also unto the King.

CONCERNING Wrecks of the Sea, it is agreed, That where a Man, a Dog, or a Cat escape quick out of the Ship, that such Ship nor Barge, nor any thing within them, shall be adjudged Wreck ; but the Goods shall be saved and kept by view of the Sheriff, Coroner, or the KingÕs Bailiff, and delivered into the hands of such as are of the Town where the Goods were found ; so that if any sue for those Goods, and [after prove5] that they were his, (6) or perished in his keeping, within a Year and a Day, they shall be restored to him without delay ; and if nor, they shall remain to the King, and be seised by the [Sheriffs, Coroners, and Bailiffs,7] and shall be delivered to them of the Town, which shall answer before the Justices of the Wreck belonging to the King ; And where Wreck belongeth to another than to the King, he shall have it in like manner. And he that otherwise doth, and thereof be attainted, shall be awarded to Prison, and make Fine at the KingÕs Will, and shall yield Damages also. And if a Bailiff do it [and it be disallowed by the Lord,8] and the Lord [will not pretend any Title thereunto,9] the Bailiff shall answer, if he have whereof; and if he have not whereof, the Lord shall deliver his BailiffÕs Body to the King.

AND because Eleftions ought to be free, the King commandeth upon great Forfeiture, that [no Man lo] by Force of Arms, nor by Malice, or menacing, shall dis.turb any to make free Eleftion. (")

AND that no City, Borough, nor Town, nor any Man be amerced, without reasonable cause, and accord.ing to the quantity of his Trespass ; that is to say, every Freeman saving his [Freehold,"] a Merchant saving his Merchandise, a Villain saving his Waynage, and that by his or their Peers.

AND that nothing be taken for Fair Pleading, as hath been prohibited heretofore in the time of King Henry, Father to our Lord the King that now is.

It is Provided, That all generally be ready and appa.relled, at the commandment and summons of Sheriffs, and at the Cry of the Country, to [sue'] and arrest Felons, when any need is, as well within Franchise as without; and they that will not so do, and thereof be attainted, shall make a grievous Fine to the King "¥ And if default be found in the Lord of the Franchise, the King [shall take the same Franchise to himself and if default be in the Bailiff, he shall have one Year's Imprisonment, and after shall make a grievous Fine; and if he have not whereof, he shall have Imprisonment of Two Years. And if the Sheriff, Coroner, or any other Bailiff, within such Franchise or without, for Reward, or for Prayer, [or for Fear3] or for any manner of Affinity, conceal, consent, or procure to conceal, the Felonies done in their Liberties, or otherwise [will not attach nor 4J arrest such Felons there, as they may, or other.wise [will not do 3J their Office for Favour borne to such Misdoers, and be attainted thereof, they shall have one YearÕs Imprisonment, and after make a grievous Fine [at the KingÕs pleasure, if they have wherewith ;J and if they have not whereof, they shall have Imprison.ment of [three 6J Years.

AND Forasmuch as mean Persons, and undiscreet, now of late are commonly chosen to the Office of Co.roners, where it is requisite that persons honest, lawful, and wise, should occupy such Offices : It is Provided, That through all Shires sufficient Men shall be chosen to be Coroners, of the most wise and discreet Knights, which know, will, and may best attend upon such Offices, and which lawfully shall attach and present Pleas of the Crown ; and that Sheriffs shall have Counter- Rolls with the Coroners, as well of Appeals, as of En- quests, of Attachments, or of other Things which to that Office belong; and that no Coroner demand nor take any thing of any Man to do his Office, upon pain of great Forfeiture to the King.

AND Forasmuch as many being [indicated7] of Mur.der, and culpable of the same, by favourable Inquests taken by the Sheriff, and by the KingÕs Writ [of *] Odio & Atia, be replevied unto the coming of the Jus.tices in Eyre; It is Provided, That from henceforth such Inquests shall be taken by lawful Men chosen out by Oath, of whom Two at the least shall be Knights, which [by9] no affinity with the Prisoners, nor otherwise are to be suspetted.

IT is Provided also, That notorious Felons, and which openly be of evil name, and will not put themselves in Enquests of Felonies, that Men shall charge them with before the Justices at the KingÕs Suit, [shall have strong and hard Imprisonment, (") as they which refuse to stand to the common Law of the Land : But this is not to be understood of such Prisoners as be taken [oflight suspicion.

AND The King prohibiteth that none do ravish, nor take away by force, any Maiden within Age, neither by her own consent, nor without; nor any Wife or Maiden of full Age, nor any other Woman, against her Will; and if any (Õ3) do, at his Suit that will sue within Forty Days, the King shall do common right; and if none commence his Suit within Forty Days, the King shall sue; and such as be found culpable, shall have Two Years Imprisonment, and after shall fine at. the KingÕs Pleasure ; and if they have not whereof (l4) they shall be punished by longer Imprisonment, according as the Trespass requireth.

AND Forasmuch as it hath been used in some Coun.ties to outlaw Persons being appealed of Commandment, Force, Aid, oi Receipt within the same Time that he which is appealed for the Deed, [is'] outlawed; It is Provided and [commandedÕ] by the King, That none be outlawed upon Appeal of Commandment, Force, Aid, or Receipt, until he that is appealed of the Deed be attainted, so that one like Law be used therein through the Realm : Nevertheless he that will so appeal, shall not, by reason of this, intermit or leave off to commence his Appeal at the next County [against them, no more than against their Principals, which be ap.pealed s] of the Deed ; but their Exigent shall remain, until such as be appealed of the Deed be attainted by Outlawry, or otherwise.

AND Forasmuch as Sheriffs, and other, which have taken and kept in prison Persons [detected4] of Felony, and [incontinent3] have let out by Replevin such as were not replevisable, and have kept in Prison such as were replevisable, because they would gain of the one party, and grieve the other : And Forasmuch as before this Time, it was not (6) determined which Persons were replevisable, and which not, but only those that were taken for the Death of Man, or by Commandment of the King, or of his Justices, or for the Forest; It is Provided, and by the King commanded, That such Pri.soners as before were outlawed, and they which have abjured the Realm, Provors, and such as be taken with the Manour, and those which have broken the KingÕs Prison, Thieves openly defamed and known, and such as be appealed by Provors, so long as the Provors be living, if they be not of good name, and such as be taken for House-burning feloniously done, or for false Money, or for counterfeiting the KingÕs Seal, or Per.sons excommunicate, taken at the request of the Bishop, or for manifest Offences, or for Treason touching the King himself, shall be in no wise replevisable by the common Writ, nor without Writ: But such as be in- dialed of Larceny, by Enquests taken before Sheriffs or Bailiffs by their Office, or of light Suspicion, or for Petty Larceny that amounteth not [above the Value'] of twelve-pence, if they were not [guilty8] of some other Larceny aforetime, or [guilty9] of Receipt of Felons, or of Commandment, or Force, or of Aid in Felony done; or [guilty of'¡] some other Trespass, for which one ought not to lose Life nor Member, and a Man appealed by a Provor after the death of the Provor, if he be no common thief, nor defamed, shall from henceforth be let out by sufficient Surety, whereof the Sheriff will be answerable, and that without giving aught of their Goods. And if the Sheriff, or any other, let any go at large by Surety, that is not replevisable, if he be Sheriff or Constable or any other Bailiff of Fee, which hath keeping of Prisons, and thereof be attainted, he shall lose his Fee and Office for ever: And if the Under- Sheriff, Constable, or Bailiff of such as have Fee for keeping of Prisons, [do it "] contrary to the Will of his Lord, or any other Bailiff being not of Fee, they shall have Three Years Imprisonment, and make Fine at the KingÕs Pleasure. And if any withhold Prisoners reple.visable, after that they have offered sufficient Surety, he shall pay a grievous Amerciament to the King; and if he take any Reward for the Deliverance of such, he shall pay double to the Prisoner, and also shall [be in the great mercy of11] the King.

IN Right thereof, that some Persons take, and cause to be taken, the Beasts of other, chasing them out of the Shire where the Beasts were taken; It is Provided also. That none [from henceforth] do so; and if any do, he shall make a grievous Fine, as is contained in the Statute of Marlebridge, made in the 1 ime of King Henry, Father to the King that now is. And likewise it shall be done to them which take Beasts [wrong.fully,] and distrain out of their Fee ; and shall be more grievously punished, if the manner of the 1 respass do so require.

IT is Provided also, That if any from henceforth take the Beasts of other, and cause them to be driven into a Castle or Fortress, and there within the Close of such Castle or Fortress do withhold them against Gage and Pledges, [whereupon1] the Beasts be solemnly demanded by the Sheriff, or by some other Bailiff of the KingÕs, at the Suit of the Plaintiff', the Sheriff or Bailiff, taking with him the Power of [the'] Shire or Bailiwick, do assay to make Replevin of the Beasts from him that took them, or from his Lord, or from other, being Ser.vants of the Lord, whatsoever they be, that are found in the Place whereunto the Beasts were chased; (Õ) if any deforce him of the Deliverance of the Beasts, or that no Man be found for the Lord, or for him that took them, for to answer and make the Deliverance, after such time as the Lord or Taker shall be admonished to make Deliverance by the Sheriff or Bailiff, if he be in the Country, or near, or there whereas he may be con.veniently warned by the Taker, or by any other of his, to make Deliverance, if he were out of the Country when the taking was, and did not cause the Beasts to be delivered incontinent, [that4] the King, for the Trespass and Despite, shall cause the said Castle or For.tress to be beaten down without Recovery ; and all the Damages that the Plaintiff hath sustained in his Beasts, or [in!] his [Gainure,6] or any otherwise, after the first Demand made by the Sheriff or Bailiff, of the Beasts, shall be restored to him double [by the Lord, or] by him that took the Beasts, if he have whereof; and if he have not whereof, he shall have it of the Lord, at what time, or in what manner the Deliverance be made, after that the Sheriff or Bailiff shall come to make Deliver.ance ; and it is to wit, that where the Sheriff ought to return the KingÕs Writ to the Bailiff of the Lord of the Castle or Fortress, or to any other, to whom the Return (7) belongeth, if the Bailiff' of the Franchise will not make Deliverance after that the Sheriff hath made his Return unto him, then shall the Sheriff do his Office without further Delay, (*) and upon the fore- said Pains: And in like manner Deliverance shall be made by Attachment of Plaint made without Writ, and upon the same Pain. And this is to be intended in all Places where the KingÕs Writ lieth. And if that be done in the Marches of Wales, or in any other Place, where the KingÕs Writs be not current, the King, which is Sovereign Lord over all, shall do Right there unto such as will complain.

FORASMUCH as the common Fine and Amercia.ment of the whole County in Eyre of the Justices for false Judgments, or for other Trespass, is unjustly as.sessed by Sheriffs and Baretors in the Shires, so that the Sum is many times increased, and the Parcels otherwise assessed than they ought to be, to the Damage of the People, [which9] be many Times paid to the Sheriffs and Baretors, which do not acquit the Payers ; It is Provided, and the King wills, That from henceforth such Sums shall be assessed before the Justices in Eyre, afore their Departure, by the Oath of Knights and other honest Men, upon all such as ought to pay (,0) ¥, and the Justices,

IN Right of the Sheriffs, or other, which answer by their own Hands unto the Exchequer, and which have received the KingÕs FatherÕs Debts, or the KingÕs own Debts before this time, and have not acquitted the Debtors in the Exchequer; It is Provided, That the King shall send good and lawful Men through every Shire, to hear all such as will complain thereof, and to determine the Matters [there'] that all such as can prove that they have (") paid, shall be thereof acquitted for ever, whether the Sheriffs or other be living or dead, in a certain Form that shall be delivered them ; and such as have not so done, if they be living, shall be grie.vously punished ; and if they be dead, their Heirs shall answer, and be charged with the Debt. And the King hath commanded, that Sheriffs and other aforesaid shall from henceforth lawfully acquit the Debtors at the next Accompt afttr they have received such Debts ; and then the Debt shall be allowed in the Exchequer, so that it shall no more come in the Summons; and if the She.riff otherwise do, and thereof be attainted, he shall pay to the Plaintiff thrice as much as he hath received, and shall make Fine at the KingÕs Pleasure. And let every [Sheriff] take heed, that he have such a Receiver, for whom he will answer ; for the King will be recompensed of all, of the Sheriffs and their Heirs. And if any other, that is answerable to the Exchequer by his own hands so do, he shall render thrice so much to the Plaintiff, and make Fine in like manner. And that the Sheriffs shall make Tallies to all such as have paid their Debt to the King; and that the Summons of the Ex.chequer be shewed to all Debtors that demand a Sight thereof, without denying to any, and that [without taking any Reward, and without giving any Thing ;!] and he that doth contrary, the King shall punish him grievously.

IT is Provided also for Trespassers in Parks and Ponds, That if any be thereof attainted at the Suit of the Party, great and large Amends shall be awarded [according to*] the Trespass, and shall have three Years Imprisonment, and after shall make Fine at the KingÕs pleasure, if he have whereof, and then shall find good Surety, that after he shall not commit like Trespass; and if he have not whereof to make Fine, after three Years Imprisonment, he shall find like Surety; and if he cannot find like Surety, he shall abjure the Realm ; and if any being [guilty s] thereof be fugitive, and have no Land nor Tenement sufficient, whereby he may be justified, so soon as the King shall find it by Enquest, he shall be proclaimed from County to County ; and if he come not, he shall be outlawed. It is Provided also and agreed, That if none do sue within a Year and a Day [for6] the Trespass done, the King shall have the Suit; and such as be found guilty thereof by lawful Enquest, shall be punished in like manner in all points as above is said. And if any such Trespasser be attainted that he hath taken [tame Beasts,7] or other Thing, in the Parks, by manner of Robbery, in coming, tarrying, or returning, let the Common Law be executed upon him, as upon him that is attainted of open Theft and Robbery, as well at the Suit of the King, as of the Party.

IN Right of Lands of Heirs being within Age, which be in Ward of their Lords; It is Provided, That the Guardians shall keep and sustain the Land, without making Destruction of any Thing; and that of such manner of Wards shall be done in all Points, as is con.tained in the Great Charter of Liberties made in the Time of King Henry, Father to the King that now is, and that it be so used from henceforth ; and in the same manner shall Archbishopricks, Bishopricks, Abbacies, Churches, and all Spiritual Dignities be kept in Time of Vacation.

Horse or Carts go; It is Provided, that if anv of the Court so do, he shall be grievously punished by the Marshals; and if it be done out of the Court, [or by one that is not of the Court, and'] be thereof attainted, he shall pay treble Damages, and shall remain in the KingÕs Prison Forty Days.

IT is Provided, That no Sheriff shall suffer any Bar- retors [or Maintainere ofÕ] Quarrels in their Shires, neither Stewards of great Lords, nor other unless he be Attorney for his Lord, to make Suit, [norÕ] to give judgements in the Counties, nor to pronounce the judgements, if he be not specially required and prayed

(4) of all the Suitors, and Attomies of the Suitors, which shall be at the Court; and if any do, the King shall punish grievously both the Sheriff and him that so doth.

Forasmuch as there have been oftentimes found in the Country [Devisors *] of Tales, whereby discord [or occasion6] of discord, hath many times arisen be.tween the King and his People, or Great Men of this Realm ; for the Damage that hath (7) and may thereof ensue ; It is commanded, That from henceforth none be so hardy to tell or publish any false News or Tales, whereby discord, or [occasion *] of discord or slander may grow between the King and his People, or the Great Men of the Realm; and he that doth so, shall be taken and kept in Prison, until he hath brought him into the Court, [which was the first Author of the Tale.6]

OF Great Men and their Bailiffs, and other, the KingÕs Officers only excepted unto whom especial Authority is given, which at the Complaint of some, or by their own Authority, attach other passing through their Ju.risdiction with their Goods, [compelling them Ò] to answer afore them upon Contracts, Covenants, and Trespasses, done out of their Power and their Jurisdic.tion, where indeed they hold nothing of them, nor within the Franchise, where their Power is, in Prejudice of the King and his Crown, and to the Damage of the People ; It is Provided, That none from henceforth so do ; and if any do, he shall pay to him, that by this Occasion shall be attached, his Damages double, and shall be grievously amerced to the King.

FORASMUCH as before this time, reasonable Aid to make ones Son Knight, or to marry his Daughter, was never put in certain, nor how much should be taken, nor at what time, whereby some levied unrea.sonable Aid, and more often than seemed necessary, whereby the People were sore grieved ; It is Provided, That from henceforth of an whole KnightÕs Fee there be taken but xx. s. and of xx. pound Land holden in Socage xx. s. and of more, more; and of less, less; after the rate. And that none shall levy such Aid to make his Son Knight, until his Son be fifteen years of Age, nor to marry his Daughter, until she be of the age of seven years. And of that there shall be made mention in the KingÕs Writ, formed on the same, when any will demand it. And if it happen that the Father, after he hath levied such Aid of his Tenants, die before he hath married his Daughter, the Executors of the Father shall be bound to the Daughter, for so much as the Father received for the Aid. And if the FatherÕs Goods be not sufficient, his Heir shall be charged there.with unto the Daughter.

IT is Provided also and agreed, That if any Man be attainted of Disseisin done in the time of the King that now is, with Robbery of any manner of Goods or Moveables, [and be found against him Ó] by Recog.nizance of Assise of Novel Disseisin, the Judgement

And in like manner it shall be done of Disseisin with Force and Arms, although there be no Robbery.

FORASMUCH as certain People of this Realm doubt [very little4] to make a false Oath, [which they ought not to do,5] whereby much People are disherited, and lose their Right; It is Provided, That the King, of his Office, shall from henceforth grant Attaints upon En- quests in Plea of Land, or of Freehold, or of any thing touching Freehold, when it shall seem to him necessary.

AND Forasmuch as it is long time passed since the Writs undernamed were (6) limited ; It is Provided, That in conveying a Descent in a Writ of Right, none shall [presume7] to declare of the Seisin of his An.cestor further, or beyond the time of King Richard, Uncle to King Henry, Father to the King that now is; and that a Writ of Novel Disseisin, [of Partition,*] which is called Nuper obiit, have their Limitation since the first Voyage of King Henry, Father to the King that now is, into Gascoin. And that Writs of Mortdances- tor, of Cosinage, of Aicl, of Entry, and of Nativis, have their Limitation from the Coronation of the same King Henry, and not before. Nevertheless all Writs pur.chased now by themselves, or to be purchased between this and the Feast of St.John, for one Year complete, shall be pleaded from as long time, as heretofore they have been used to be pleaded.

FORASMUCH as many People are delayed of their Right by false vouching to Warranty; It is Provided, That in Writs of Possession, [first in Writ9] of Mort- dauncestor, of Cosinage, of Aiel, Nuper obiit, of Intru.sion, and other like Writs, whereby Lands or Tenements are demanded, which ought to descend, revert, remain, or [escheatl0] by the death of any Ancestor or [other.wise,"] if the Tenant vouch to Warranty, and the De.mandant counterpleadeth him, and will aver by Assise, or by the Country, or otherwise, as the Court will award, that the Tenant, or his Ancestor, whose Heir he is, was the first that entered after the Death of him, of whose Seisin he demandeth ; the Averment of the De.mandant shall be received, if the Tenant [will abide thereupon";] and if not, he shall be further compelled to another answer, if he have not his Warrantor present, that wiil warrant him freely, and incontinent enter into the Warranty; saving unto the Demandant his Excep.tions against him, if he will vouch [further,'1] as he had before against the first Tenant. From henceforth in all manner of Writs of Entry, which make mention of Degrees, none shall vouch out of the Line : or in other Writs of Entry, where no mention is made of Degrees; which [Writ '4] shall not be maintained, but in cases where the other Writs of Degrees cannot ('5) lie, nor hold place : and in a Writ of Right It is Provided, That if theTenant vouch to Warranty, and the Demandant will counter-plead him, and be ready to aver by the Country, that he that is vouched to Warranty, nor his Ancestors, had never Seisin of the Land or Tenement demanded, nor Fee or Service by the hands of [his,4] Tenant, or his Ancestors, since the Time of him, on whose Seisin the Demandant declareth, until the lime that the Writ was purchased, and the Plea moved, whereby he might have infeoffed the 'Tenant or his Ancestors, then let the Aver.ment of the Demandant be received, if the Tenant [will abide thereupon17;] if not, the Tenant shall be further

compelled unto another Answer, if he be not present that will warrant him freely, and incontinent enter in Answer, saving unto the Demandant his Exceptions against him, as he had afore against the first Tenant. And the said Exception shall have place in a Writ of Mortdauncestor, and in the other Writs before named, as well as in Writs that concern Right. And if percase the Tenant have a [Deed, that compriseth Warranty of another Man, which is bound in none of these cases before mentioned to the Warranty of an elder Degree,'] his Recovery, by a Writ of Warranty of Charters out of the KingÕs Chancery, shall be saved to him at what time soever he will purchase it; howbeit the Plea shall not be de.layed therefore.

TOUCHING the Oaths of Champions, It is thus chÈm^onÕ* Provided, because it seldom [happened,Õ] but that the oÈth m * Champion of the [DefendantJ] is forsworn, in that he Writ of sweareth, that he or his Father saw the Seisin of his Right. Lord, or his Ancestor, and that his Father commanded him to dereign that Right; that from henceforth the Champion of the Demandant shall not be compelled so to swear: Nevertheless his Oath shall be kept in all other Points.

FORASMUCH as in a Writ of Assise, Attaints, and XLII. Juris utrum, the Jurors been often troubled by reason of >ft¡r Ò¡ln the Essoins of Tenants ; It is Provided, That after the Appearance. Tenant hath once appeared in the Court, he shall be no more essoined, but shall make his Attorney to sue for him, if he will; and if not, the Assise or Jury shall be taken through his Default.

FORASMUCH as Demandants be oftentimes delayed XLIII. of their Right, by reason that many Parceners be Te- p,8Ó"', nants, of which none may be compelled to answer j/c< without the other, or (*) there may be many jointly in- feoffed, where none knoweth his several, and such Te.nants oftentimes fourch by Essoin, so that every of them hath a several Essoin; It is Provided, That from hence.forth such Tenants shall not have Essoin, but at one Day, (5) no more than one sole Tenant should have; so that from henceforth they shall no more fourch, but only shall have one Essoin.

FORASMUCH as divers Persons cause themselves XLIV. falsely to be essoined, for being over the Sea, where ?,?*¡lnw indeed they were within the Realm the Day of the Sum- tra mons; It is Provided from henceforth, That this Essoin be not always allowed, if the Demandant will challenge it, and will be ready to aver that he was in England the Day of Summons and three weeks after ; but shall be adjourned in this Form: That if the Demandant [be ready6] at a certain Day, [by Averment ofÕ] the Country, or otherwise as the Court shall award, [to prove'] that the Tenant was within the Four Seas the Day that he was summoned, and three Weeks after, so that he might be reasonably warned by the Summons, the Essoin shall be turned into a Default; and that is to be understanden only before Justices.

CONCERNING Delays in all Manner of Writs XLV. [and *] Attachments, It is thus Provided, That if the ^roceÒt0 Tenant or Defendant, after the first [Attachments re- cªi* rance turned,10] make Default, that incontinent the great PPÒr*nce- Distress shall be awarded; and if the Sheriff- do not make sufficient Return by a certain day, he shall be grievously amerced; and if he return, that he hath done Execution in due manner, and the Issues delivered to the Sureties, then the Sheriff shall be commanded, that he 1

return Issues at another Day before the Justices ; and if the Party being attached come in at his Day to save his Defaults, he shall have the Issues; and if he come not, the King shall have them ; and the [KingÕs Justices '] shall cause them to be delivered in the Wardrobe ; and the Justices of the Bench at Westminster shall deliver them in the Exchequer ; and the Justices in Eyre unto the Sheriff of that Shire where they plead, as well of that Shire, as of foreign Shires, and (') shall be charged therewith in Summons by the Rolls of Justices.

IT is Provided also, and commanded by the King, That the Justices of the KingÕs Bench (J) at Westminster from henceforth shall decide all Pleas [determinable4] at one Day, before any matter be [arraigned,5] or [Plea commenced6] the Day following, saving that their Essoins shall be entered, judged, and allowed ; yet, by reason hereof, let none presume to absent himself at the Day to him limited.

IT is Provided also, That if any from henceforth pur.chase a Writ of Novel Disseisin, and he against whom the Writ was brought as Principal Disseisor, dieth be.fore the Assise be passed, then the Plaintiff shall have his Writ of Entry upon Disseisin against the Heir or Heirs of the Disseisor [or Disseisors,7] of what Age soever they be : In the same wise the Heir or Heirs of the Disseisee shall have their Writs of Entry against the Disseisors, or their Heirs, of what Age soever they be, if peradventure the Disseisee die before that he hath purchased his Writ; so that for the Nonage of the Heirs of the one party, nor of the other, the Writ shall not be abated, nor the Plea delayed; but as much as a man can without offending the Law, it must be hasted to make fresh Suit after the Disseisin. And in like manner [this shall be observed in all points for the Right of Prelates,8] Men of Religion, and other, to whom Lands and Tenements [can in no wise descend9] after others death, whether they be Disseisees or Disseisors. And if the Parties in pleading come to an Inquest, and it passeth against the Heir within Age, and namely, against the Heir of the Disseisee, that in such case he shall have an Attaint of the KingÕs special Grace.

IF a Guardian, [orlo] Chief Lord, infeoff any Man of Land, that is the Inheritance of a Child within Age, and in his Ward, to the Disheritance of the Heir ; It is Pro.vided, That the Heir shall forthwith have his Recovery by Assise of Novel disseisin against his Guardian, and against the Tenant; and the Seisin shall be delivered by the Justices, if it be recovered, to the next Friend of the Heir, to whom the Inheritance cannot descend, for to improve to the Use of the Heir, and to answer for the Issues unto the Heir, when he shall come unto his full Age ; and the Guardian, during his Life, shall lose the custody of the thing recovered, and all (") the Inheritance that he holdeth [by reason Ó] of the Heir. And if an.other Guardian than the Chief Lord do it, he shall lose the Wardship [of all together,'5] and be grievously pu.nished by the King. And if the Infant be carried away, or disturbed by the Guardian, or by the Feoffee, or by other, by reason whereof he cannot sue his Assise, then may one of his next Friends, that will, sue for him ; which shall be thereto admitted.

IN a Writ of Dower, called Unde nihil habet, the Writ shall not abate by the Exception of the Tenant, because she hath received her Dower of another Man before her Writ purchased, unless he can shew that she hath received Part of her Dower of himself, and in the same town, before the Writ purchased.

AND Forasmuch as the King hath ordained these things unto the Honour of God and Holy Church, and for the Commonwealth, and for the Remedy of such as be grieved, he would not that at any other time it should turn in Prejudice of himself, or of his Crown j but that such Right, as appertains to him, should be saved in all points.

In like manner it is to be inquired of them that be drowned, or suddenly dead: and after, [such Bodies are to be seen,1] whether they were so drowned, or slain, or strangled, by the sign of a cord lied straight about their necks, or [about any of their members, or upon *] any other hurt found upon their Bodies. whereupon they shall proceed in the Form aliove- said: and if they were not slain, then ought the Coroner to attach the Finders, and all other in the company. A Coroner also ought to inquire of 1 rea- sure that is found, who were the Finders, and likewise who is suspected thereof; and that may be well per.ceived where one liveth riotously, haunting laverns, and hath done so of long time; hereupon [he'] may be attached for this suspicion by four, or six, or more Pledges, [if he may be found.*] Further, if any be appealed of Rape, he must be attached, if the Appeal be fresh, and [they must see'] apparent sign of truth by Effusion of Blood, or an open Cry made; and such shall be attached by four or six Pledges, if they may be found : If the Appeal were without Cry, or without any manifest Sign or Token, two Pledges shall be sufficient. Upon Appeal of Wounds and such like, especially if the Wounds be mortal, the Parties ap.pealed shall be taken immediately and kept until it be known perfectly, whether he that is hurt shall recover, or not; and if he die, [the Defendant6] shall be kept; and if he recover health, they shall be attached by four or six Pledges, after as the Wound is great or small. If it be for a Maim, he shall find no less than four Pledges; if it be for a small Wound, (7) two Pledges shall suffice ; also all Wounds ought to be viewed, the Length, Breadth, and Deepness, and with what Wea.pons, and in what Part of the Body the Wound or Hurt is; and how many be culpable, and how many Wounds there be, and who gave the Wound, (") all which things must be inrolled in the Roll of the Coroners. Moreover if any be appealed, [of any Aft done, as Principal,g] they that be appealed of the Force, shall be attached also, [and] surely [kept in Ward,] until the Principals be attainted ('Ò) [or delivered.] Concerning Horses, Boats, Carts, [&c.] whereby any are slain, that properly arc called Deodands, they shall be valued and delivered unto the Towns, [as before is said.]

Concerning Wreck of the Sea, wheresoever it be found, if any lay Hands on it, he shall be attached by sufficient Pledges, and the Price of the Wreck shall be valued and delivered to the Towns. If any be suspefted of the Death of any Man being in danger of Life, he shall be taken and imprisoned, as before is said; In like manner Huy shall be levied for all [Murthers, Burglaries, and for Men slain, or in Peril to be slain,'1] as otherwise is used in England; and all shall follow the Huy and Steps, [as near as can be ;"] and he that

The STATUTE of BIGAMY.

i.

Of Aid of the King where there is Warranty.

II.

Of Aid of the King where there is no Warranty.

IN the Presence of [certain Reverend Fathers, Bishops of England, and others of the KingÕs Council,'] the Constitutions under written were recited, ( ) and after heard and published before the King and his Council; [Forasmuch as all the KingÕs Council,3] as well Jus.tices as other, did agree that they should be put in Writing for a perpetual Memory, and that they should be stedfastly observed.

The First Article.

CONCERNING Pleas where the Tenant excepteth, that he cannot answer without the King j It is agreed by the Justices, and other learned Men of our Lord the KingÕs Council of the Realm, which heretofore have had the use and practice of Judgement, that where a Feoffment was made by the King [with a Deed thereupon, that if4] another person by a like Feoff.ment and like Deed (s) be bounden to Warranty, the Justices could not heretofore have proceeded any fur.ther, neither yet do proceed without the KingÕs Com.mandment had therefore ; (6) neither can it be thought that they may proceed.

[AND it seemeth also, that they could not proceed in certain Cases,7] as where the King hath confirmed or ratified [any ManÕs Deed to the Use of another,*] or hath granted and thing (9) as much as in him is, or [where a Deed is shewed, and Clause contained therein, whereby he ought to warrantize,"*] and in like Cases they shall not surcease by occasion of [aM] Confirma.tion, (Ó) Grant, or Surrender, or other like, but, after

6 neither can it be thought that, in tuch cate, concerning Lands, Rights, and Possessions being in the KingÕs hand, they may proceed, since the King himself hath no Superior, who can be Judge of him, or bis Ad. In lile manner also it is agreed, by the same Persons, that concerning Tene. aunts or Wardships, or other things where it would be to the King's prejudice, that upon the answer of the Tenant that which is demanded could or might be lost, the Justices have not proceeded further ;

A STATUTE concerning JUSTICES being assigned;

called Rageman.

TT is accorded by our Lord the King, and by his Council, -*¥ That Justices shall go throughout the Land to inquire, hear, and determine all the Complaints and Suits for Trespasses committed within these Twenty-five years past, before the Feast of Saint Michael, in the fourth year of King Edward ; as well by the KingÕs Bailiffs and Officers as by other Bailiffs, and by all other Persons whomsoever} except Appeals of Felonies, and except the Complaints and Suits pending else.where before the KingÕs Justices, or in the County Court by Writ or without Writ; so nevertheless that they do hear and determine the Causes depending before them: And this is to be understood as well of outrageous Takings, and all Manner of Trespasses, Quarrels, and Offences done unto the King and others, touched in the Inquests heretofore found by the KingÕs Command, as of Trespasses committed since; and especially of Trespasses since committed by any Bailiffs whomsoever, against the good Men by whose Oaths those Inquests were made. And the King willeth, that for Relief of the People and speedy Execution of Justice, That the Complaints of every one be heard before the aforesaid Justices, and determined, as well by Writ as without, ac.cording to the Articles delivered unto the same Justices, and this is to be understood as well within Franchise as without. Also the King willeth that the same Justices do hear and determine the Complaints of those who will complain of Mat.ters done by any one contrary to the KingÕs Statutes, as well of what concerneth the King as the People. And the King willeth of those also who are attainted of Trespasses, where Amerciament only appertaineth, that the Plea shall be finally determined, and the Amends forthwith made to the Plaintiff. And concerning those who may be attainted of Trespass, where Fine or Imprisonment lieth or appertaineth, the Amends shall forthwith be adjudged to the Plaintiff, and Execution thereof shall be had without Delay; and the Trespassers shall be put by good Mainprise to appear before the KingÕs Justices at the Parliament next eusuing, if they can find Mainpernors; and if not, they shall abide in Prison: and the Justices shall make Inquiry by their Office, of their Lands and Goods, and of the manner of the Trespass, and shall thereof certify the King at the same Parliament, so that he may then punish them according to their Desert. And because the KingÕs Court ought to be favourable in such manner of Causes, the King willeth, and doth enjoin his Jus.tices, that none, in complaining nor answering, shall be sur.prised or troubled by Trickers or Barrettors, whereby the Truth may not be found out, and Offenders remain un.punished, until the next Parliament. And Moreover let the Justices have regard to the Time of War, and to the Cove.nants made in such Time, so that by occasion thereof no Man shall be troubled for the aforesaid Covenants.

OF GLOUCESTER.

XHE Year of Grace MCCLXXVIII, and the Sixth of the Reign of King Edward Son of King Henry, at Gloucester, in the month of August, the King himself providing for the Amendment of his Realm, and for a fuller Administration of Justice, as the good of the Kingly Office requireth, having called unto him the more discreet persons of his Kingdom, as well of the greater as of the less: It is Established and Ordained with one accord, That Whereas the same Kingdom, in many divers Cases, as well of Franchises as of other Things, wherein afore.time the Law hath failed, and to avoid the grievous Damages and innumerable Disherisons which this Default of the Law hath caused to the People of the Realm, hath need of divers Additions to the Law, and of new Provisions, therefore the Statutes, Ordinances, and Provisions under-written should be stedfastly observed by all the People of the Kingdom.

Whereas the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and others of the Kingdom, claim to have divets Franchises, for the Examination and Judgement whereof the King had appointed a day to the said Prelates, Earls, Barons, and others: It is Provided and granted with one accord, that the aforesaid Prelates Earls Barons, and others, may use such sort of Franchises, so that nothing accrue to them by Usurpation or Occupation, and that they occupy nothing against the King, until the next coming of the King through the County, or the next coming of the Justices in Eyre for Common Pleas into the same County, or until the King shall otherwise order: Saving the KingÕs Right when he shall put the same in Suit, according to what is contained in the KingÕs Writ. And hereof Writs shall be issued to the Sheriffs Bailiffs and others, in Behalf of every Demandant; and the Form of the Writ shall be changed according to the Diversity of the Franchises that each man claimeth.

And the Sheriffs shall cause it to be commonly pro.claimed throughout their Bailliwicks, that is to say, in Cities Boroughs Market Towns and elsewhere, that all those who claim to have any Franchises by the Charters of the KingÕs Predecessors, Kings of England, or in other manner, shall come before the King or before the Justices in Eyre, at a certain day and place, to shew what sort of Franchises they claim to have, and by what Warrant. And the She.riffs themselves shall then be there in their proper persons, with their Bailiffs and Officers, to certify the King upon the aforesaid Franchises and other matters touching the same. And this Proclamation before the King shall con.tain Warning of three Weeks. And in like manner shall the Sheriffs make Proclamation in the Circuit of the Justices ; and in like manner shall come in their proper persons, with

* The whole of this Statute, as here given from the Tower Roll in French, is entered, with some Variations, in a Register-Book of the Time, marked A. among the Records in the Treasury of the Court of the Receipt of the Exchequer, preserved in the Chapter House at Westminster; fo. 27 6 ; A Copy or Translation of the Statute in Latin is given in fo. 272 b. &c. of the same Register; as also in the Liter Custumarum in the Town ClerkÕs Office, London; and in other Manuscripts. The Tower Roll being injured and illegible in some places, the Words defeflive have been supplied from the French Entry in the Register Book A., and are distinguished by being included in Brackets without any Figure of Reference. In MS. Cot/. Claudius D. II. the Statute is given in French; with a Note at the End Ô ExÕ p rotulum,Õ and agrees very exaCtly with the Statute Roll in the Tower. In that Cotton Manuscript, and in very many other Manuscripts, the Introductory Part of the Statute relating to Franchises is given in Latin, with some Variations from the French Text, as a separate Statute, de Quo Warranto or de Ijbertate clamanda. The Ro.l of Statutes in the Bodleian Library, No. 1036, MS. Cott. Vespas. B.VII, and very many other MSS. give this Statute of Gloucester, in French, commencing only with a short Introduction something similar to the first Paragraph of the Statute on the Tower Roll, and then proceeding to Chapter I. respecting Damages in Novel Disseisin. The Old Printed Copies give this Statute with a like short Introduction in French : and also give a Copy of the Introductory Part in Latin, as a Statute of Quo Warranto, 30 Edw. I. In all English Editions of the Statutes previous to HawkinsÕs Edition, a Translation of the short Introduction is given at the Beginning of the Statute, and the Translation of the Latin Introduction is given as a Statute of 30 Edw. I. In HawkinsÕs and subsequent Editions the Original of the French Introduction on the Tower Roll is given without a Translation ; and a Translation of the Latin Introduction is given without the Original.

their Bailiffs and Officers, to certify the Justices of such sort of Franchises, and other matters touching the same. And this Proclamation shall give warning of forty days, as the common summons containeth ; So that if the Party who claimeth the Franchise come before the King, he shall not be put in Default before the Justices in Eyre; forasmuch as the King of his special Grace hath granted that he will save the Party harmless in respeft of this adjournment. And if any such Party be impleaded upon such sort of Franchises before two of the aforesaid Justices, the same Justices before whom the Party is in Plea, shall save him harmless before other Justices; and the King likewise before himself, when he shall know from the Justices that the Party was in Plea before them, as it is before said. And if they that claim to have such Franchises come not at the day aforesaid, then the Franchises shall be taken into the KingÕs hand by the Sheriff of the place, in name of Distress ; so that they shall not use such sort of Franchises until they come to receive Justice. And when they come upon that Distress, their Franchises shall be replevied, if they demand them ; upon which Re.plevin th?y shall answer forthwith in the form aforesaid. And if peradventure the parties except, that they ought not to answer thereupon without an original Writ, then if it can be known that they have, by their own aft, usurped or occu.pied any Franchises upon the King or his predecessors, they shall be told forthwith to answer without Writ; and shall thereon receive such Judgment as the KingÕs Court shall award. And if they alledge further that their Ancestor or Ancestors died seised of the same Franchises, they shall be heard, and forthwith Inquiry shall be made of the Truth, and according thereto the Justices shall proceed in the business. And if it be found that their Ancestor died seised thereof, then the King shall have an original Writ out of his Chancery in the form made for that purpose. ÒThe King to the Sheriff, Greeting : Summon by good summoners such an one, that he be before Us, at such a place, upon our next coming into the County; or before our Justices at the first Assises, when they shall come into those parts ., to shew by what Warrant [he holds his View of Frank-pledge in his Manor of N. in the same County; and let the Sheriffs have there the Summoners and this Writ: or thus; by what Warrant he holds the hundred of B. in the County aforesaid : or thus ; by what Warrant] he claims to be quit of Toll, for him or his men, throughout our Realm, by continuance after the death of such an one late his predecessor. And have there the summoners and this Writ.Ó [And the Forms of the Writs shall be charged according to the diversity of the Franchises and of the Case, and according to the Discretion of the Chancery, and of the Justices.] And if the Parties come at the day, let them answer; whereupon Replication shall be made, and Judgement given. And if they come not, neither essoin themselves before the King, and the King tarry longer in that County, the Sheriff shall be com.manded to cause them to appear at the fourth day; at which day if they come not, and the King tarry longer in that County, the proceeding shall be as it is in the Circuit of the Justices. And if the King depart out of that County, the Parties shall be adjourned unto a short day, and shall have reasonable delays ac.cording to the discretion of the Justices, as in aftions personal. And the Justices in Eyre shall proceed herein, in their Cir.cuits, according to the Ordinance aforesaid and according as such sort of Pleas ought to be proceeded upon in the Eyre.

Concerning Complaints made and to be made of the King's Bailiffs, and of other Bailiffs, it shall be done according to the Ordinance before made thereof, and according to the In.quests before had thereupon. And the Justices in Eyre shall do therein, according to what the King hath enjoined them, and according to the Articles which the King hath given them in charge.

WHEREAS heretofore Damages were not awarded in Assises of Novel Disseisin, but only against the Disseisors: It is Provided, That if the Disseisors do aliene the Lands, and have not whereof there may be Damages levied, that they to whose hand such Tene.ments shall come, shall be charged with the Damages, so that eveiy one shall answer for his time. It is Pro.vided also, that the Disseisee shall recover Damages in a Writ of Entry upon Novel Disseisin, against him that is found Tenant after the Disseisor. It is Provided also, that where before this time Damages were not awarded in a Plea of Mortdauncestor, but in case where the Land was recovered against the Chief Lord, that from henceforth Damages shall be awarded in all Cases where a man recovereth by Assise of Mortdauncestor, as be.fore is said in Assise of Novel Disseisin : And likewise Damages shall be recovered in Writs of Cosinage, Aiel, and Besaiel.

And Whereas before Time Damages were not taxed, but to the Value of the Issues of the Land; It is Pro.vided, that the Demandant may recover against the Tenant the Costs of his Writ purchased, together with the Damages abovesaid. And this Ad shall hold place in all cases where the Party is to recover Damages.

And every Person from henceforth (Õ) shall be com.pelled to render Damages, [where the Land is reco.vered !] against him upon his own Intrusion, or his own Ad.

IF a Child within Age be holden from his Heritage after the death of his [Father,] Cosin, Grandfather, or Great Grandfather, whereby he is driven to his Writ, and his Adversary cometh into the Court, and for his Answer alledgeth a Feoffment, or pleadeth some other thing, whereby the Justices award an Enquest, there, whereas the Enquest was deferred unto the full Age [of the Infant,] now the Enquest shall pass as well as if he were of full Age.

IT is Established also, That if a Man aliene a Tene.ment, that he holdeth by the Law of England, his Son shall not be barred by the Deed of his Father, from whom no Heritage to him descended, to demand and recover by W rit of Mortdauncestor, of the Seisin of his Mother, although the Deed of his Father doth mention, that he and his Heits be bound to Warranty. And if any Heritage descend to him of his FatherÕs side, then he shall be barred for the Value of the Heritage that is to him descended. And if in Time after any Heritage descend to him by the same Father, then shall the Tenant recover against him of the Seisin of his Mother by a judicial Writ that shall issue out of the Rolls of the Justices before whom the Plea was pleaded, to resummon his Warranty, as before hath been done in Cases where the Warrantor cometh into the Court, saying, That nothing descended from him by whose Deed he is vouched. And in like manner the Issue of the Son shall recover by Writ of Cosinage, Aiel, and Besaiel. Likewise in like manner the Heir of the Wife shall not be barred of his Aftion, after the Death of his Father and Mother, by the Deed of his Father, if he demand [by a&ion] the Inheritance (Õ) of his Mother by a Writ of Entry, which his Father did aliene in the time of his Mother, whereof no Fine is levied in the KingÕs Court.

ALSO if a Man let his Land to [Ferni,1] or to find Estovers, in Meat or in Cloth, amounting to the Fourth Part of the very Value of the Land, and he which hold- eth the Land so charged letteth it lie fresh, so that the Party can find no Distress there, by the Space of two or three years, [to compel the Farmer to render, or to do as *] is contained in the Writing [or3] Lease; It is es.tablished, That the two Years being passed, the Lessor shall have an Aftion to demand the Land in Demean by a Writ which he shall have out of the Chancery. And if he against whom the Land is demanded come before Judgement, and pay the Arrearages and the Damages, and find Surety, such as the Court shall think sufficient, to pay from thenceforth as is contained in the Writing of his Lease, he shall keep the Land. And if he tarry until it be recovered by Judgement, he shall be barred for ever.

IT is Provided also, That a Man from henceforth shall have a Writ of Waste (4) in the Chancery against him that holdeth by Law of England, or otherwise for Term of Life, or for Term of Years, or a Woman in Dower; and he which shall be attainted of Waste, shall leese the Thing that he hath wasted, and moreover shall recompense thrice so much as the Waste shall be taxed at. And for Waste made in the Time of Ward.ship, it shall be done as is contained in the Great Charter. And where it is contained in the Great Charter, that he which did Waste during the Custody, shall leese the Wardship, It is agreed that he shall recompense the Heir his Damages for the Waste, if so be that the Wardship lost do not amount to the Value of the Damages before the Age of the Heir of the same Wardship.

IT is Provided also, That if a Man die, having many Heirs, of whom one is Son or Daughter, Brother or Sister, Nephew or Niece, and the other be of a further Degree, all the Heirs shall recover from henceforth by a Writ of Mortdauncestor (s).

ALSO if a Woman sell or give in Fee, or for Term of Life, the Land that she holdeth in Dower ; It is ordained, That the Heir, or other to whom the Land ought to revert after the Death of such Woman, shall have present Recovery to demand the Land by a Writ of Entry made thereof in the Chancery.

IT is Provided also, That Sheriffs shall plead Pleas of Trespass in their Counties, as they have been accus.tomed to be pleaded. And that none from henceforth shall have Writs of Trespass before Justices, unless he swear by his faith, that the Goods taken away were worth Forty Shillings at the least. And if he complain of Beating, he shall answer by his Faith, that his Plaint is true. Touching Wounds and Maims, a Man shall have his Writ as before hath been used. And it is agreed, that the Defendants in such Pleas may make their Attornies, where Appeal lieth not; so that if they be attainted (6) being absent, then the Sheriff shall be commanded to take them, and (7) shall have like Pain as they should have had, if they had been present at the Judgement given. And if the Plaintiffs from henceforth in such Trespasses cause themselves to be essoined after the first Appearance, Day shall be given them unto the coming of the Justices [in Eyre,] and the Defendants in the mean time shall be in Peace. [In such Pleas and other, whereas Attachments and Distresses do lie,'] (Õ) if the Defendant essoin himself of the KingÕs Service, and do not bring his Warrant at the Day given him by the Essoin, he shall recompense the Plaintiff Damages for his Journey Twenty Shillings, or more, after the Discretion of the Justices, and shall be grievously amerced unto the King.

THE King commandeth, That no Writ shall be granted out of the Chancery for the Death of a Man to enquire whether a Man did kill another by Misfortune, or in his own Defence, or in other Manner [without Felony ;'] [but he shall be put in Prison until the coming of the Justices in Eyre, or Justices assigned to the Gaol-delivery, and shall put himself upon the Country before them for Good and Evil; ^ In case it be found Õ] by the Country, that he did it in his De.fence, or by Misfortune, then by [the Report of the Justices to the King,1] the King shall take him to his Grace, if it please him.

It is Provided also, that no Appeal shall be abated so, [soon4] as they have been heretofore ; but if the Appellor declare the Deed, the Year, the Day, the Hour, the Time of the King, and the Town where the Deed was done, and with what Weapon he was slain, the Appeal shall stand in effeft; and (Ô) shall not be abated, for Default of Fresh Suit, if the Party shall sue within the Year and the Day after the Deed done.

WHEREAS it is contained in the Statute of the King that now is, that Two Parceners, or 1 wo that hold in common, may not fourch by Essoin, after that they have once appeared in the Court : It is Provided, I hat the same be observed and kept, where a Man and his Wife be impleaded in the KingÕs Court.

IT is Provided also, That if any Man lease his Tene.ment in the City of London, for Term of Years, and he to whom the Freehold belongeth, causeth himself to be impleaded by Collusion, and maketh Default after Default, or r.ometh into the Court, and giveth it up, for to make the Termor lose his Term, and [the De.mandant hath his Suit,6] so that the Termor may recover by Writ of Covenant: The Mayor and Bailiffs may inquire by a good Inquest, in the presence of the Termor and the Demandant, whether the Demandant moved his Plea upon good Right that he had, or by Collusion, or by Fraud, to make the Termor lose his Term : And if it be found by the Inquest, that the Demandant moved his Plea upon good Right that he had, the Judgement shall be given forthwith : And if it be found by Inquest that he impleaded him by Fraud, to put the Termor from his Term, [then shall the Termor enjoy his Term, and] the Execution of Judgement for the Demandant shall be suspended until the Term be expired. And in like Manner it shall be of Equity before the Justices in such Case, if the Termor do challenge it before the Judgement.

IT is Provided also, That if a Man impleaded for a Tenement in the same City, doth vouch a Foreigner to Warranty, that he shall come into the Chancery, and have a Writ to summon his Warrantor at a certain Day before the Justices of the Bench, and another Writ to the Mayor and Bailiffs of London, that they shall sur.cease in the Matter that is before them by Writ, until the Plea of the Warranty be determined before the Justices of the Bench : And when the Plea at the Bench shall be determined, then shall [he that is vouched7] be commanded to go into the City, to answer unto the chief Plea. And a Writ shall be awarded, at the Suit of the Demandant, by the Justices (*) unto the Mayor and Bailiffs, that they shall proceed in the Plea. And if the Demandant recover [against the Tenant,] the Tenant shall come before the Justices of the Bench, [which shall di-eft Õ] a Writ to the Mayor and Bailiffs, that if the Tenant have lost his Land, they shall cause the Land to be extended, and valued, and shall return the Extent at a certain Day into the Bench ; and after it shall be commanded to the Sheriff of the Shire, where the [Warrantee10] was summoned, that he shall cause him to have as much of the Land of the Warrantor in Value.

IT is Provided also, That after such Time as a Plea shall be moved in the City of London by Writ, the Tenant shall have no Power to make any Waste or Estrepement of the Land in demand, hanging the Plea, [and if he do, the Mayor and Bailiffs shall cause it'] to be kept at the Suit of the Demandant. And the same Ordinance and Statute shall be observed in other Cities, Boroughs, and every where throughout the Realm.

THE King of his special Grace granteth unto the Citizens of London, that whereas beforetimes they that were disseised of Freehold in the same City could not recover their Damages, before the coming of the Justices to the Tower, that from henceforth the Disseisees shall have Damages by Recognizance of the same Assise whereby they recovered their Lands ; and the Disseisors shall be amerced before Two Barons of the Exchequer, which shall resort once a Year into the City to do it. And it shall be commanded unto the Barons and to the Treasurer of the Exchequer, that they shall cause [it1] every Year to be [levied3] by Two of them at their rising after Candlemas. And the Amerciaments by Summons of the Exchequer shall be levied to the KingÕs Use, and be delivered at the Exchequer.

IT is Provided also, That the Mayor and Bailiffs be.fore the coming of those Barons, shall enquire of Wines sold against the Assize, and shall present it before them at their coming, and then (4) shall be amerced, where they were wont to tarry unto the coming of the Justicers [in Eyre.]

Exposition of the Statute of Gloucester.

AFTER, by the King and his Justices, certain Expo.sitions were made upon some of the Articles above mentioned ; that is to wit; To the first Article, [for Entries by Disseisin,1] Damages shall run from the Time of the Statute published. In the same wise in Writs of Entry upon Disseisin ; and (Õ) in all Writs of Mort- dauncestor, C.osinage, Aiel, or Besael, [of Intrusion by3] oneÕs own Aft by any manner of Writ, Damages shall run after the Writ purchased against them that held [by Statute,4] albeit their Ancestors (s) died [seised thereof.] Touching an Inquest to be made of such as be within Age, the Statute shall run without Limitation of Time. Touching Alienation of Lands holden by the Law of England, the Statute shall run for such Lands being aliened after the Time of the Statute published. In like manner the Statute shall extend and run upon the Lands of a Wife aliened by her Husband, whereas no Fine was levied thereof in Court. Touching Lands being let in Fee-ferm, to pay therefore yearly the Fourth Part of the very Value thereof, the Statute shall run as well unto Lands that were leased before the making of the Statute, as after ; in case that the Tenant have with- holden above the Space of Two Years after the Statute published, so much as he should have paid to his Lessor yearly according to the Form of the Covenant. And as to the Punishment of Waste in all Cases, except it be of Dowers and Wards, it shall be understood of Wastes done sithence the Statute [published.] And of the Forfeiture of Treble in Cases of Wastes of Dowers and Wardships, it shall be understood of Waste committed after the Statute [published.] And as con.cerning them which do aliene their Dowers, it is to be understood after [the publishing of] the Statute.

Given at Gloucester the Sunday next after the Feast of Saint Peter ad Vincula, the Sixth year of the Reign of King Edward the FÕirst.

We have Provided also, That if any Person, Religious or other, do presume

(5) either by Craft or Engine to offend against this Sta.tute, it shall be lawful to Us and other [Chief Lords of the Fee immediate to enter into the Land so aliened,6] within a Year from the Time of the Alienation, and to hold it in Fee [as an7] Inheritance. And if the Chief Lord immediate be negligent, and will not enter into such Fee within the Year, then it shall be lawful to the next Chief Lord immediate of the same Fee to enter into the same [Land Ò] within half a Year next following, and to hold it as before is said ; and so every Lord immediate may enter into [such Land,6] if [the next Lord Ô¡] be negligent in entering into the same Fee, as is aforesaid. And if all the Chief Lords of such Fees, being of full Age, within the Four Seas, and out of Prison, be negli.gent or slack in this Behalf, (") We, immediately after the Year accomplished, from the Time that such Pur.chases, Gifts, or Appropriations hap to be made, shall take such Lands and Tenements into our Hand, and shall infeoff other therein by certain Services to be done ('*) to Us for the Defence of our Realm ; saving to the Chief Lords of the same Fees their Wards and Eschetes, [and other Services thereunto ,J] due and accustomed. And therefore We command you, that ye cause the fore- said Statute to be read before you, and from henceforth to be kept firmly and observed.

Witness Myself at Westminster the Fifteenth day of November, the Seventh year of our Reign.

FORASMUCH as Merchants, which heretofore have lent their Goods to divers persons, be greatly im.poverished, because there is no speedy Law provided for them to have Recovery of their Debts at the Day of Payment assigned ; and by reason hereof many Mer.chants [have withdrawn to come '] into this Realm with their Merchandises, to the Damage as well of the Mer.chants, as of the whole Realm: The King by himself and by his Council hath ordained and established, That the Merchant which will be sure of his Debt, shall cause his Debtor to come before the Mayor of London, or of York, or Bristol, [or*] before the Mayor and a Clerk, which the King shall appoint for the same, for to knowledge the Debt and the Day of Payment; and the Recognisance shall be entered into a Roll with the Hand of the said Clerk, which shall be known. Moreover, the said Clerk shall make with his own Hand a Bill Obligatory, whereunto the Seal of the Debtor shall be put, with the KingÕs Seal, that shall be provided for the same Purpose, the which Seal shall remain in the keeping of the Mayor and Clerk aforesaid : And if the Debtor doth not pay at the Lay to him limited, the Creditor may come before the said Mayor and Clerk with his Bill obligatory; and if it be found by the Roll, and by the Bill, that the Debt was knowledged, and that the Day of Payment is expired, the Mayor shall incontinent cause the Moveables of the Debtor to be sold, as far as the Debt doth amount, by the praising of honest Men, [as Chattels,'] Burgages de.visable, until the whole Sum of the Debt; and the Money, without delay, shall be paid to the Creditor. And if the Mayor can find no Buyer, he shall cause the Moveables to be delivered to the Creditor at a reasonable Price, as much as doth amount to the Sum of the Debt, in Allowance of his Debt: And the KingÕs Seal shall be put unto the Sale and Deliverance of the Burgages devisable for a perpetual Witness. And if the Debtor have no Moveables within the Jurisdiction of the Mayor, whereupon the Debt may be levied, but hath some otherwhere within the Realm, then shall the Mayor send the Recognisance, made before him and the Clerk aforesaid, unto the Chancellor, under the [KingÕs Seal'1;] and the Chancellor shall direft a Writ unto the Sheriff, in whose Bailiwick the Moveables of the Debtor be, and the Sheriff shall cause [him to agree with his CreditorÕ] in such Form as (Ô) the Mayor should have done in case that the Moveables of the Debtor had been within his Power ; and let them that shall praise the moveable Goods, to be delivered unto the Creditor, take good heed that they do set a (7) reasonable Price ' do refrain to come

And if the Debtor will say, that his move- able Goods were delivered or sold for less than they were worth, yet shall he have no Remedy thereby; [for when '3 the Mayor or the Sheriff hath sold the moveable Goods lawfully to him that offered most; [he may account it his own folly, that he did not sell his own moveable Goods himself before the Day of his Suit, when he might, and would not, and have levied the Money with his own Hands.1] And if the Debtor have no Moveables whereupon the Debt may be levied, then shall his Body be taken where it may be found, and kept in Prison until that he have made Agreement, or his Friends for him ; and if he have not (J) wherewith he may sustain himself in Prison, the Creditor shall find him Bread and Water, to the end that he die not in Prison for default of Sustenance, the which Costs the Debtor shall recompense him with his Debt, before that he be let out of Prison. And if the Creditor be a Merchant Stranger, he shall remain at the Costs of the Debtor for so long Time as he [tarrieth about the Suit of his Debt, and until4J the moveable Goods of the Debtor be sold or delivered unto him. And if the Creditor do not [take5] the Debtor alone for the Surety of his Payment, by reason whereof Pledges or Main.pernors be founden, then those Pledges or Mainpernors shall come before the Mayor and Clerk abovesaid, and shall bind themselves by Writings and Recognizances, as afore is said of the Debtor. And in like manner if the Debt be not paid at the Day limited, such Execution shall be awarded against the Pledges or Mainpernors, as before is said of the Debtor; Provided nevertheless, That so long as the Debt may be fully taken and levied of the Goods moveable of the Debtor, the Mainpernors or Pledges shall be without Damage : Notwithstanding, for Default of moveable Goods of the Debtor, the Cre.ditor shall have [Execution of his Recognisance upon ÒJ the Mainpernors or Pledges, in such manner and form as before is limited against the principal Debtor.

And to defray the Charge of the aforesaid Clerk, the King shall take out of every Pound one Penny. This Ordinance and Adi the King willeth to be holden from henceforth through.out all his Realm of England, among all Persons whosoever they may be, who shall freely choose to make such Recogni.sance } except Jews, to whom this Statute extendeth not.

And by this Statute a Writ of Debt shall not be abated. And the Chancellor, Barons of the Exchequer, Justices of the one Bench and of the other, and Justices Errants, shall not be estopped to take Recognizances of Debts of those who shall choose so to do before them; but the Execution of Recogni.zances before them shall not be made according to the Form aforesaid, but according to the Law, Usage, and Manner here.tofore used.

EDWARD by the Grace of God King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitain, to all hii Subjects of his Land of Snowdon, and of other his Lands in Wales, Greeting in the Lord. The Divine Providence, which is un.erring in its own Government, among other gifts of its Dis.pensation, wherewith it hath vouchsafed to distinguish Us and our Realm of England, hath now of its favour wholly and en.tirely transferred under our proper dominion, the Land of Wales with its Inhabitants, heretofore subjeft unto us in Feudal Right, all obstacles whatsoever ceasing; and hath annexed and united the same unto the Crown of the aforesaid Realm, as a Member of the same Body. We therefore, under the Divine Will, being desirous that our aforesaid Land of Snowdon and our other Lands in those parts, like as all those which are sub- je£f unto our Power, should be governed with due Order, to the Honour and Praise of God and of Holy Church, and the Advancement of Justice, and that the People or Inhabitants of those Lands who have submitted themselves absolutely unto our will, and whom We have thereunto so accepted, should be pro.tected in security within our peace under fixed Laws and Cus.toms, have caused to be rehearsed before Us and the Nobles of our Realm, the Laws and Customs of those parts hitherto in use: Which being diligently heard and fully understood, We have, by the Advice of the aforesaid Nobles, abolished certain of them, some thereof We have allowed, and some We have cor.rected j and We have likewise commanded certain others to be ordained and added thereto ; and these We will shall be from henceforth for ever stedfastly kept and observed in our Lands in those parts, according to the Form underwritten.

We have Provided and by our command ordained, That the Justice of Snowdon shall have the Custody and Government of the Peace of Us the King in Snowdon, and our Lands of Wales adjoining; and shall administer Justice to all Persons whatsoever, according to original Writs of Us the King, and also the Laws and Customs underwritten. We likewise will and ordain that there be Sheriffs, Coroners, and Bailiffs of Commotes in Snowdon, and our Lands of those parts. A She.riff of Anglesea, under whom shall be the whole Land of Anglesea, with its Cantreds, Metes, and Bounds. A Sheriff of Caemarvan, under whom shall be the Cantred of Arvan, the Cantred of Arthlencoyth, the Commote of Cruthin, the Cantred of Thleen, and the Commote of Yvionith. A Sheriff of Merioneth, under whom shall be the Cantred of Merioneth, the Commote of Ardovey, and the Commote of Peuthlin, and the Commote of Deyrinoin, with their Metes and Bounds. A Sheriff of Flint, under whom shall be the Cantred of En- glefeud, the Land of Maillor Sexeneyth, and the Land of Hope, and all the Land adjoining to our Castle and Town of Rothelan unto the Town of Chester, shall from henceforth be obedient under Us to our Justice of Chester, and shall answer for the Issues of the same Commote at our Exchequer of Chester. There shall be Coroners in the same Counties, to be chosen by the KingÕs Writ, the tenor whereof is to be found among the original Writs of the Chancery. There shall like.wise be Bailiffs of Commotes, who shall faithfully do and dis.charge their Offices, and diligently attend thereto, according to what shall be given them in charge by the Justice and Sheriffs.

Of the Office of Sheriff in Wales ; and the Manner of holding Courts.

THE Sheriff ought to execute his Office in this Form, to wit 5 When any one shall have complained to him of any Trespass done to him against the Peace of our Lord the King, or of the taking and wrongful detaining of Cattle, or of an unjust taking, or of Debt or any other Contract not fulfilled and the like, either by Writ or without Writ, first let him take Pledges of prosecuting his Claim, or the partyÕs Oath if he be a poor man, and afterwards make Execution as is more fully declared, in this manner, the Defendants in each case shall be sum.moned to be at the next County Court, to answer unto the Plaintiffs; at which Court, after Summons made and Proof thereof, if they come not, they shall be summoned again by Award of the Court, to be at another Court next ensuing, to answer as before ; at which, if they come not, after Summons repeated and Proof thereof, they shall be summoned by Award of the Court a third time, to be at the next third County Court to answer as before; at which Court, if they come not, then the Plaintiffs by Judgement of the Court, as well in Pitas by Writ as Plaints without Writ, shall recover their Demands together with Damages or Amends, as well in moveables as in immoveables, according as the Aftions require. And for such Defaults a Penalty shall be incurred to our Lord the King, according to the Law and Custom of Wales. And when the parties shall have appeared to plead, each shall be received without Fine to relate the Truth of his Case; and according to the Plaints, Answers, and Allegations on either side, shall be the Proceeding to Judgement for the Plaintiff or Defendant, by the Award of the County Court; and the Punishment shall be according to the Quality and Quantity of the Offence. And it is to be known that the County Court ought to be holden in this Manner, to wit, from Month to Month, in such Place as our Lord the King shall ordain ; and this upon Monday in one County, upon Tuesday in another, upon Wed.nesday in a third County, and upon Thursday in a fourth, and not upon any other days. And the Sheriff shall proceed thus in the holding of his County Court. First he shall hear and receive before himself and the Coroner and the Suitors of the County, the Presentments of Felonies and of Casualties that shall have happened between two Counties, touching the death of a man, in this manner ; That the four Townships next to the place where the fail of Manslaughter or Misaventure shall have happened, shall come to the next County Court, together with him that found the dead man, and the Welshery, that is, the Kindred of the Person slain, and there shall pre.sent the Fa£t of Felony, the Case of Misadventure, and the manner of either: Declaring thus,That on such a day, at such a place, it fell out that such an one, known or unknown, was found slain feloniously, or drowned, or otherwise dead by misad.venture, and such an one found him, who is present, &c. and that Presentment shall be forthwith inrolled, as well in the Coroner's Roll as in the SheriffÕs. And if there should be present man or woman that would sue by Appeal, there shall be Pledges to prosecute taken forthwith, and the Appeal shall be sued in that County Court. So that if the Appellees should appear, they shall straight be taken, and detained in the prison of our Lord the King until the coming of the Justice, and be safely kept; And if they should not appear, then upon the Prosecution of the Appellor they shall be exacted from one County Couit to another; and if they come not at the fourth Court, or be not taken to pledge, they shall be outlawed, and Women shall be waived. And if they should not ap.pear at the first County Court where they shall be exacted, their Lands and Chattels shall be forthwith taken and seised in the hand of our Lord the King, and shall be delivered into Ward to the Townships, as hereunder. In the same manner shall the proceeding be in an Appeal of Wounding, Maihem, Rape, Arson, and Robbery, against the Appellees, if they should not appear. And if they should appear, and find suf.ficient Pledges, six at the least, or more, to abide Judgement at the coming of the Justice, they shall straight be replevied.

The Forms of the KingÕs Original Writs to be pleaded in Wales.

The Writ of Novel Disseisin for a Freehold, whereof any Freeholder shall have been disseised unjustly, and without Judgement.

The King to the Sheriff of Anglesey, Greeting. A. hath complained unto us that B. and C. unjustly, and without Judgement, have disseised him of his Freehold in N. after the Proclamation of our Peace in Wales, in the eleventh year of our Reign. And therefore We command you, that if the aforesaid A. shall give you Security to prosecute his Claim, then you shall cause the said Tenement to be reseised of the Chattels that shall have been taken in the same; and the same Tene.ment with the Chattels to be in peace until a certain day, whereof our Justice shall give you Notice.

The King to the Sheriff, Greeting. If A. shall give you Security to prosecute his Claim, then summon by good Sum.moned twelve free and lawful men of the neighbourhood of N. to come before our Justice, ready upon their Oath to make Recognition whether B. the Father of the aforesaid A. was 3eised in his Demesne as of Fee of such a Manor with the Appurtenances, or of so much Land with the Appurtenances, in N. on the day when he died ; and whether he died since the Proclamation of our Peace in Wales, in the eleventh year of our reign. And whether the same A. be his next Heir. And in the mean time let them view that Manor or that Land, and cause their names to be put in writing. And summon by good Summoners C., who now holdeth that Manor, or that Land, that he be then there to hear that Recognition. And have there the Summoned and this Writ. Dated, &c.

And Letters Patent shall be made in these woras, until our Lord the King shall ordain otherwise: The King to his Justice, Greeting. Know Ye, that We have constituted you our Justice, together with those whom ye shall think fit to be associated unto you, to take the Assizes of Novel Disseisin and Mortdauncestor in the Parts of Wales. And therefore we command you that at certain days and places, which you shall therefore provide, you do take those Assizes; doing therein what appertained to Justice, according to the Law and Custom of our Realm. Saving unto us the Amercements and other things therefore due unto us : For we have given command to our Sheriffs, that they do cause those Assizes to come before you, at certain days and places which you shall for the same make known unto them. In witness whereof wc have caused these our Letters Patent to be made unto you. Dated, &c. Anil there shall be a Writ Close, by the Com.mand of the Justice to be directed to the Sheriffs in this Form: The King to the Sheriff, Greeting. We command you that you cause to come before our Justice at certain days and places which he shall make known unto you, all the Assizes of Novel Disseisin and Mortdancestor arraigned before the same Justice by our Writs, together with the original Writs, Attachments, and all other Proceedings concerning the said Assizes ; and this Writ. Dated, &c.

And the Form of the Writ shall be changed according to the Diversities of the Cases ; that is to wit, if the Mother, or the Brother, or the Sister, or the Uncle, or the Aunt were seised in Demesne as of Fee of the Thing demanded by Process of Mortdancestor, on the Day when they died. And when many Coheirs and Parceners of any Inheritance demand that Inheritance, that is to say, when one of them demandeth on the Death of Father or Mother, Brother or Sister, Uncle or Aunt, and another or others of those Coheirs demand on the Death of a Grandfather or Grandmother, or Cousin, Male or Female, a Writ of Mortdancestor shall be made to them upon their Case; because that Part of the said Writ that toucheth the kind of Ancestor who is dead, according to the Clause thereof commonly used, draweth unto it the Nature of other Articles touching Coheirs in remoter Degrees.

Of Pleas, some are to be determined by the Assize, some by Juries: By the Assise are to be determined;

WHEN one who is seised of a Freehold, being afterwards disseised by Force, demandeth Seisin to be restored to him, in this Case there is provided the Writ of Novel Disseisin, in the Form above written among the other original Writs of the Chancery : In like manner for Common of Pasture, when one being disseised of his Common of Pasture appurtenant unto his Freehold, demandeth Seisin to be restored to him; for this Case also there is provided the same Writ of Novel Disseisin, by the changing of certain Words in the Form above written among the other original Writ3 of the Chancery ; wherein the Proceeding is to be thus: First, the Sheriff, having taken from the Plaintiff two Pledges to prosecute, shall cause to be chosen Twelve free and lawful Men, Sec. of the neighbourhood where the Tenement or Pasture lietli, and shall cause them to view the Tenement, and in like manner the Pasture, and shall attach the Disseisors as it is contained in the Writ: Afterwards, when the Parties and the Assise shall come before the Justice, the Plaintiff shall be asked of what Freehold or of what Com.mon of Pasture he complaincth that he is disseised; and ac.cording to his Complaint, and the Answer of the adverse Party, they shall proceed to the taking of the Assise, unless the Disseisor can say any thing wherefore the Assise ought to tarry.

be summoned by Two good and lawful Summoners, that he be before the Justice at a certain Day; and the Summons shall contain Warning of Fifteen Days at the least ; at which Day, if he come, the Justice shall proceed in the Execution of his Office. And if he come not at that day, he shall be punished foT his Default according to the Provision of the Welsh Law, that is to say, by Three Cows or the Value thereof; and he shall be summoned again by Two other Summoners, by a Summons containing the like Warning of Fifteen Days, as before is said ; at which Day, whether he come or not, the Justice shall proceed to do his Office, unless he shall cause himself to be essoined for being beyond Sea, and then there shall be given him the space of Forty Days, so that he have Ebb and Flood; but let him that shall so essoin himself, beware: For if, being within the Four Seas, he falsely essoin himself for being beyond Sen, and be thereof convi£t by good Proof, or by good Inquest, he shall be punished as for a De.fault, at the first by Amerciament, according to what is con.tained in the Welsh Law; and also, he shall be estopped from saying any thing against the assise, unless he can vouch to Warranty. And be it known, that neither in the Writ of Mortdancestor, nor in any Writ of a Plea of Land, doth any Essoin lie, except only the Essoin of being beyond Sea, and this before the Tenant or Deforciant appeared) in Court; and the Essoin of being in the KingÕs Service, which lieth in every stage of the Plea when the King shall be pleased to warrant the same: but let him beware that be doth not falsely cause himself to be essoined of the King's Service; for if he should fail of the King's Warranty, he shall be punished for his Default by Amercement to be made to our Lord the King, according to the Welsh Law, and by paying to the adverse Party his Expences of that Day, according to the Justice's discretion. In these Writs of Mortdancestor, the Proceeding shall be after this Manner : First, the Writ being read wherein is contained the Claim of the Demandant, the Deforciant shall be asked if he can say ought wherefore the Assise ought to tarry : Which if he cannot, the Justice shall take the Assise by the Jurors who may best know the Truth, according to the Form of the Writ. And if the Assise pass for the Demand.ant, Seisin shall be adjudged to the Demandant with Damages taxed by the Jurors, and the Deforciant shall abide in the King's Mercy. But the Deforciant may alledge many Things against the Assise; for he may vouch to Warranty, and then the arrival of the Warrantor is to be waited for; whom the Justice shall cause to come by one Summons at the first, and if it be necessary by Re-summons, as hath been said in the case of the principal Deforciant; and he shall be punished for a Default as is aforesaid: if after Re-summons he come not, nor shall essoin himself, the Assise shall proceed against him by Default. And if the Assise pass for the Demandant, Seisin of the thing in question shall be adjudged to the De.mandant, and the Deforciant shall have to the Value, of the Land of the Warrantor. But if the Warrantor come, and require to have that shewn him whereby he ought to warrant, it behoveth the Voucher to shew the Deed, that maketh men.tion of the Warranty, or of a Gift made by the Warrantor or his Ancestor whose Heir he is, wherein it is declared that he ought to hold of the Feoffor and his Heirs; or, to shew ihat the Warrantor were seised of his Homage for the Tenement demanded ; which is to be inquired of, if it should be denied, by those before whom he shall say he did the Homage, to.gether with other free and lawful men sworn; or, that he holdeth that Tenement in Exchange for another Tenement: if hereupon the Deforciant can bring his Warrantor to war.rant, he shall abide in the King's Mercy, because he hath denied the Warranty: Yet nevertheless it shall be considered that he may warrant, and make Answer to the Assise, if he choose.

The Deforciant may alledge many other Things against the Assise; to wit, that the Ancestor of whose Death, &c. committed Felony, for which he was hanged, outlawed, or as a publick Thief escaping, and not obedient to the Law, beheaded; or that he abjured Wales, upon Confession of the Felony before the Coroner: The Deforciant may also object Bastardy to the Demandant; and thereupon the Bishop of the place shall be direfted to make Inquiry of the Truth of the Fa£t; and thereof to certify the Chief Justice of Wales; And according to what the Bishop shall have certi- fied, they shall proceed to Judgment, without taking the Assise:

Warranty.

And if the Bishop return that he is a Bastard, he shall be estopped from making the Demand ; And if he return that he is legitimate the Justice shall cause the Deforciant to come by Summons, and if it be necessary, by Re-summons ; reserving to the King as hath been often said, the Amercement for De.fault } After the Resummons, whether he come or not, the Demandant shall recover his Demand by the BishopÕs Testi.mony, whose Testimony shall not be gainsayed ; and he shall remain in the KingÕs Mercy. Many other things he may al.ledge, which it is hard to enumerate ; as that the Ancestor on whose Death the Assise is arraigned was a Villain, and held the Land in Villenage; or that he held it at Will, or for Term of Life, or Years : In which cases the Assise of Mort- dancestor lieth not. And the abovesaid Assises of Novel Dis.seisin and Mortdancestor ought not to be taken but in their proper Counties, lest the Country should be overcharged with trouble and expence; but the Assises shall be taken by the Justice twice, thrice, or four times in the Year.

It hath been treated in part of Writs and Assises, and of the Proceeding therein : It behoveth now to speak of Pleas that are to be determined by Inquests or by Juries: Whereof some are of Things immoveable as of Tenements, or of Moveables, as of Debts and Chattels, some of both Kinds, some of Tres.passes: But first, something is to be said of Tenements and immoveable Things ; For which there is a Writ provided, the Form whereof is contained among the other Writs of those Parts ; The Process upon that Writ is such; First, there being found Pledges to prosecute, the Sheriff shall cause the Tenant to be summoned by good Summoners, that he appear at a certain Day; at which Day if he come not, he shall be sum.moned again for another Day ; and if he come not at the second Day, he shall be summoned to appear at a third Day ; at which Day if he come not, nor cause himself to be essoined, Seisin shall be awarded to the Demandant by Default, and the Deforciant shall abide in the KingÕs Mercy; Reserving never.theless unto the King the Amercement for every Default, as hath been said before.

Now when the Deforciant shall appear, by reason that the PlaintiffÕs Demand cannot be known from the Words of the Writ, for that the Causes of suing are many, and almost in.finite, it is necessary that the Demandant should count against the Deforciant, and express the Cause of his Demand, and this by Words that contain the l ruth, without Exception to Words: Not following that hard rule, He who fails in a Syllable, fails in the whole Cause.

Of the Causes of Suit, what they may be and ought to be, it is fit that something should be briefly said. Oftentimes the Demandant hath Right by this, that his Ancestor held the Land in Demand, and was thereof seised as of Right and Fee; and then the Demandant must count of the Descent of Kin descending to himself. It happeneth also that a man demiseth Land for Term of Life or Years, after which Term the Land ought to revert to himself or his Heirs; Or likewise that it ought to revert to him, after the Death of a Woman Tenant in Dower; or as an Escheat after the Death of his Tenant, being a Bastard, because such an one cannot have other Heir than one lawfully begotten of his own Body ; Or, after the Death of his Tenant, who hath committed Felony : In any of the four Cases aforesaid, or where, after the Death of any one the Land ought to remain unto another by the Form of the Gift, in these Cases and the like, the Demandant shall de.clare his Demand according to his Case; and in these Cases and the like, wherein the aforesaid Writ is to be used, that, and none other, shall be used: And the DemandantÕs Count being heard, the Tenant shall have a view of the Land, if he require it, and a Day shall be given within which the View shall be had; and at the Day given after the View, the t Deforciant shall make Answer; who may vouch to War.ranty by the Aid of the Court, as it hath been said in the Writ of Mortdancestor; and the Justice shall cause the War.rantor to come, as he caused the Principal, by one Summons, and if it be necessary by a second and a third ; at which, if he come not, he being punished upon every Default, as is aforesaid. Seisin of the thing in question shall be awarded to the Demandant for the Default of the Warrantor; and the Deforciant shall have to the Value of the Land of the Warrantor, and the Warrantor shall be in Mercy. If the Warrantor come and freely warrant, he shall be received to an.swer and defend the Plea, without having a View of the Land.

But if he shall deny the Warranty, the Plea of the Warranty shall be carried on between them, after the manner above di- re&ed in the Writ of Mortdancestor. But if the Deforciant except against the Demandant, that his Ancestor whose Seisin he demanded), or any one in the Descent, were a Bastard, so that nothing can descend from him or through him, he shall be heard; Or he may shew a Deed of Feoffment of his An.cestor, or of Quit Claim of any one in the Descent: And upon the Affirmation of the one Party and the Denial of the other, the Parties shall descend to the lawful Inquest: and by the Verdifl of the Inquest shall the Plea be determined) because Pleas of Land in those Parts are not to be determined by Battle, nor by the Grand Assise. So if he should except that the Ancestor or any one in the Descent committed Felony, whereby the Aflion lieth not for him j in which case, if he to whom this is opposed denieth it, the matter ought rather to be determined by the Record of the Justice, or of the In.quest of the Country of the hanging and beheading, and also by the Record of the Coroner of the Outlawry and Abjuration. In like manner, on the Demand of a Tenement that ought to revert after a term past, or by the Condition of the Gift, upon the Affirmation of the one Party and the Denial of the other, they shall descend to the Inquest of the Country, and accord.ing to their Vcrdifl shall the Judgment be.

Concerning the other Article, to wit, of Moveables, Debts, and Chattels, it remaineth to speak ; for which there is pro.vided the Writ of Debt in the Form above written) in this Writ, the Proceeding shall be after this manner. First, there being found Pledges to prosecute, the Debtor and Defendant shall be summoned to be before the Justice at a certain day, at which if he come not, he shall be summoned again ., and if at the second day he come not, nor essoin himself, the Debt shall be adjudged to the Plaintiff by Default, together with Damages, at the discretion of the Justice, or by the In.quest of the Country, at the will of the Justice, and the Debtor shall abide in the KingÕs Mercy ; reserving always to the King the Amercement for every Default. But if the Debtor appear, the Plaintiff must then declare his Demand, and the cause of his Demand; that is to say, that he is indebted unto him in an Hundred Marks which he lent him, the Day of Payment whereof is past-, or for Land, or an Horse, or for other Goods or Chattels whatsoever sold to him; or for the Arrears of a Rent not growing out of Tenements) or upon other Confratts} whereupon he must produce his Suit, or shew the Deed of Obligation or Tally : The Demand being heard and understood, and also the Declaration of the Plaintiff, the Debtor shall answer thereto; and if he acknowledge the Debt, judgement shall be given against him, and it shall be levied of his Goods and Chattels, &c) if he deny the Debt, and his Bond be brought forth against him, the Writing must be verified by the Witnesses named in the Bond, if they be living, together with the Jury -, and if there be no Witnesses named, or if they should be dead, it shall be verified by the Jury only; and according to their Verdi& shall Judgement be awarded. But if the Plaintiff have not a Bond, but produce his Suit only or a Tally, the adverse Party may deny that he is indebted tš him in any thing, and make his Defence by Wager of Law, that is, by his own Oath and eleven others swearing with him, or by the Country, at his eledfion. It happeneth sometimes that the Debtor confesseth that he did once owe the Debt, and alledgeth Payment thereof} in this case he must shew an Acquittance of the Payment, or else the Plaintiff may deny, by Wager of Law, that he hath received ought, or likewise by the Country, See. This Writ of Debt shall not be granted for a less Sum than Forty Shillings ) for of a less Debt the Plea shall be in the County Court, either with Writ or without.

CONCERNING the Third Article ) in which there is pro.vided the Writ of Covenant, whereby sometimes Moveables are demanded, and sometimes Immoveables, by force of a Cove.nant entered into between the Parties, which may differ from the Law, in the Form described in the Place before n?-ied. The Proceeding upon this Writ is thus: First, there being found Pledges to prosecute, the Defendant shall be summoned once, and if it be necessary a second time) and if he come not upon the second Summons, nor essoin himself, the Demand and Declaration of the Plaintiff shall be heard) and the thing demanded shall be taken into the KingÕs hand, if it be aTene-

ment j and if it be a Chattel, that or its Value shall be taken into the KingÕs hand, and another day shall be given him ; And if within fifteen days he shall replevy the thing so taken into the KingÕs hand, and appear at the day given him, he shall be received to answer and defend ; but if not, the Plain.tiffÕs Demand shall be awarded to him by Default, together with Damages taxed, as is said before in the Writ of Debt. And he shall remain in the King's Mercy: Saving always to the King the Amercement for the Default as aforesaid. The PlaintiffÕs Complaint being heard, and the Declaration of his Demand, the Defendant shall make answer; and upon the Affirmation of the one Party and the Denial of the other, they shall proceed to the Inquest, and the Business shall be determined by the Inquest of the Country. And it is to be known that sometimes a Freehold is demanded by the Writ of Covenant; as where any man letteth Land to another to farm, rendering therefore a certain Rent, under a Condition added thereto in the writing of Covenant, that if he be not satis.fied for the Rent, it shall be lawful for him to enter into the Land that he hath demised, and to hold the same; If he to whom the Land hath been demised do not pay the Rent, and he who hath demised it hath not the means of entering into the Land demised, according to the tenor of his Writing, by reason of the Power of his Adversary, in this Case he ought to recover the Tenement by the Writ of Covenant, together with Damages. Where sometimes a Covenant is made between Parties, that the one shall infeoff the other of a certain Tenement, and shall deliver Seisin unto him at a certain day, if afterwards he should transfer that Tenement by Feoffment to a third Person, since he cannot annul that Feoffment by virtue of the first Contract that was not carried into effeft, in that case the injured Party cannot have other Redress by Writ of Covenant, but this only, that he have a Satisfaction in Money for his Damages; and thus in one case there lieth an Aftion to demand a Tenement by Writ of Covenant, and in another case Money or Damages, or the Tenement. And for that Contracts in Covenants are infinite, it would be difficult to make mention of each in particular; but according to the Nature of each Covenant, by the Affirm.ation of the one Party and the Denial of the other, it will either come to be tried by Inquest upon the FaCt, or it will come to an Acknowledgment of the Writings brought into Judgement, and according to that Acknowledgment Judge.ment will be awarded; or the Writings will be denied, and then it will come to an Inquiry into the making of the Writings, by the Witnesses named in the Writings, if there be such, together with the Jury : And if there should be no Witnesses named, or they should be dead, then by the Jury only.

CONCERNING the Fourth Article, to wit, personal Tres.passes : Whereof it is provided. That all Trespasses wherein the Damages do not exceed Forty Shillings shall be pleaded before the Sheriff in the County Court without Writ, by Gages and Pledges: Trespasses that exceed the Sum of Forty Shil.lings, shall be pleaded before the Justice of Wales, after this manner: The Plaintiff, before he be heard by the Justice, shall swear that his Demand exceedeth the Sum of Forty Shillings; and this being done, and Pledges to prosecute found, the Jus.tice shall command the Sheriff or Bailiff of the place, that he cause to come before him, within a short term, him of whom Complaint is made; and the PlaintiffÕs Complaint being heard, the Defendant shall make his Answer : And since in a Plea of Trespass the Defendant can hardly do otherwise than make his Defence by the Country, the Justice, by Consent of Par.ties, shall make Inquiry of the Truth by lawful Inquest ; and that Inquiry made, if he find the Defendant guilty, he shall punish him by Imprisonment, or by Ransom, or by Amerce.ment, and Payment of Damages to the injured Party, ac.cording to the Quality and Quantity of the Offence: So that this Punishment be for example to others, and make them fear to offend: and whereas mention is made above of the Consent of Parties, it may happen that the Defendant will refuse the Trial by the Country; in which case, if the Plaintiff offer to verify the Trespass done unto him by the Country, and the Defendant refuse the same, he shall be taken for convidt, and shall be punished as though he were convidt by the Country.

AND whereas heretofore Women have not been endowed in Wales, the King granteth that they shall be endowed. The Dower of a Woman is two fold : One is an Assignment of the Third Part of the whole Land that belonged to her Husband which were his during Coverture, whereof there lieth the Writ of reasonable Dower, elsewhere described in ita place, with the other Writi for Wales. The Proceeding in this Writ is thus: There being found Pledges to prosecute, the Deforciant shall be summoned to appear at a certain day, at which if he come not, he shall be summoned again ; at which day, if he come not, the Woman shall have her Dower awarded unto her; that is to say, the Third Part, Dec. together with Damages, 8tc. But if the Defendant appear, he shall be received to answer, without having a View of the Land ; and the WomanÕs Demand being made, the Tenant shall be di.rected to answer, if he can alledge any thing wherefore she ought not to have her Dower; and if he can alledge nothings the Woman shall recover as abote. If he should objed that she ought not to have her Dower, because she was never espoused in lawful Matrimony to him whom she calleth her Husband, then the Bishop shall be charged to make Inquiry of the Truth thereof: And that Inquiry made, he shall certify it to the Justice of Wales. And according to the Bishop's Certificate, shall the Proceeding to Judgement be, after this manner: If the Bishop certify that she was not the lawful Wife, she shall be foreclosed of her ACtion of Dower } if he tiertify that she was the lawful Wife, the Tenant shall be summoned to appear at a certain day to hear his Judgement} at which day, if he come not, he shall be summoned unto another day; at which day whether he come or not, there being no Essoin allowed, the Woman shall recover her Dower and Damages -, and the Tenant in Mercy. Saving always to the King the Ametcement for Default. But if he objed that she ought not to have her Dower, because her Husband did not hold the Tenement whereof she demandeth Dower, either on the day when he married her or at any time after, in Fee, so that he could thereof have endowed her; the Truth of this fad is to be inquired of by the Country only and according to their Verdid shall the Judgement be awarded. If it be objeded unto her that she ought not to have her Dower, because her Husband committed Felony, then if the Felony be proved, she shall not recover Dower. So if it bo objeded unto her that her Husband lost the Land whereof she demandeth Dower by Judgement, as that whereunto he had not Right; if this be denied, and be proved by the Re.cord of the Justices before whom that Land was lost, or by the Country if it were lost in the County or inferior Court, she shall be precluded from having her Adion of Dower. The other Dower is when a Son endoweth his Wife by the Assent of his Father | the Form of the Writ whereof is to be found among the rest ; wherein the Proceeding is after this manner: The Deforciant shall be summoned as in the other Writ of Dower, and in like manner his Contumacy shall be punished, as in the other Writ of Dower; but if he come at the day given him, then the WomanÕs Demand being made, he shall answer thereto ¥, and if the Endowment made, in the said Form and the Consent to the Dower be denied, and it be established by the Country that the Husband did endow her at the Church door of his FatherÕs Tenement, and that the Father, in his own Person or by a special Messenger therefore sent, did consent to that Dower, the Woman shall recover her Dower and Damages. It is also to be known that in either Writ the Tenant may vouch to Warranty, with the Aid of the Court, and the Proceeding in the Plea of Warranty shall be as is before directed ; but there is a Differ.ence between this Case of Dower and that above by Praecipe, where tbe Mode of Proceeding endeth in the Warranty; because there the Demandant in that case always recovereth the thing demanded, and the Tenant, out of the Land of the Warrantor, to the Value: In the Case of Dower it it other.wise, because the Tenant will keep his Land in Peace, and the Woman will have to the Value of her Dower demanded, out of the Land of the Warrantor; provided that the Tenant hath of the Land of her Husband to the Value whereby this may be done, but if otherwise, not. Concerning other Assign- ment of Dower, there is nothing said for the present.

hath been partible, Our Lord the King will not hare that Custom abrogated ; but wilkth that Inheritances shall remain partible among like Heirs, as it was wont to be, and Parti.tion of the same Inheritance shall be made as it was wont to be made; with this Exception, that Bastards from hence.forth shall not inherit, and also shall not hare Portions with the lawful Heirs, nor without the lawful Heirs. And if it happen that any Inheritance should hereafter, upon the Failure of Heir Male, descend unto Females, the lawful Heirs of their Ancestor last seised thereof, We will of our especial Grace that the same Women shall have their Portions thereof, to be assigned them in our Court, although this be contrary to the Custom of Wales before used.

AND Whereas the People of Wales have besought us that We would grant unto them, That concerning their Possessions immoveable, as Lands and Tenements, the Truth may be tried by good and lawful Men of the Neighbourhood, chosen by Consent of Parties ; and concerning things moveable, as of Contrafls, Debts, Sureties, Covenants, Trespasses, Chattels, and all other moveables of the same sort, they may use the Welsh Law, whereto they have been accustomed ; which was this, that if a Man complain of another upon Contracts or things, done in such a place that the PlaintiffÕs Case may be proved by those who saw and heard it, when the Plaintiff shall establish his Case by those Witnesses, whose Testimony cannot be disproved, then he ought to recover the thing in Demand, and the adverse Party be condemned} and that in other Cases which cannot be proved by Persons who saw and heard, the Defendant should be put to his Purgation, sometimes with a greater Number, sometimes with less, according to the Quality and Quantity of the Matter or Deed : And that in Theft, if one be taken with the Mainour, he shall not be ad.mitted to Purgation, but be holden for convict: We, for the common Peace and Quiet of our aforesaid People of our Land of Wales, do grant the Premises unto them : Yet so that they hold not place in Thefts, Larcenies, Burnings, Mur.ders, Manslaughters, and manifest and notorious Robberies, nor do by any means extend unto these; wherein We will that they shall use the Laws of England, as is before declared.

And therefore We command you that from henceforth you do stedfastly observe the Premises in all things. So notwith.standing that whensoever and wheresoever and as often as it shall be our Pleasure, we may declare, interpret, enlarge, or diminish the aforesaid Statutes, and the several Parts of them, according to our mere Will, and as to us shall seem expe.dient for the Security of Us and of our Land aforesaid.

In Witness whereof our Seal hath been affixed to these Presents. Given at Rothelan on Sunday in Midlent, in the Twelfth Year of our Reign.

THE King to his Treasurer and Barons of the Ex.chequer, (Õ) Greeting. To the Intent that Provision may be had for the Indempnity of Us and our People, in certain things touching Us and our People aforesaid, in our said Court of Exchequer ; We will and provide, That from henceforth the Bodies of Shires shall not be written in several Rolls, but shall be written in a certain annual Roll by themselves, and shall be read every Year upon the Accompts of Sheriffs; that is to wit, [of seve.ral Counties,1] that it may be known if aught may accrue unto Us (J) by any mean. The Remanents of the Ferms of the same Shires [shall be written post terras datas4] in the annual Rolls, and the Sheriffs shall be charged therewith : in which Remanents the Liveries and Alms assigned shall be allowed, and other Allow.ances, if Sheriffs have had any, of the Issues of their Bailiwicks by our Writs. And because [of the Sug.gestion of our Bailiffs,4] our Writs are made of divers Allowances, unto our grievous Damage, We will and provide, That of such manner Allowances so to be made, from henceforth View shall be made in our Ex.chequer ; and the same View being faithfully made, the same Treasurer and Barons shall certify our Chancellor of the due Allowances so to be made, and that Writs of Allowances shall be made according to the same Cer.tificate. Moreover, there shall be written in the same annual Rolls the Ferms of the Sheriffs, the Profits of Counties, the Ferms of Serjeanties and Asserts, the Ferms of Cities, Boroughs, Towns, and other Ferms, whereof there is Answer made yearly in the Exchequer. And in them also shall be written all Debts determined, all gross Debts, whereof there is hope that somewhat shall be paid ; and all other Debts that seem to be clear: But when it is come unto accompt to the Title of New Duties, nothing shall be written in the annual Roll, but those Debts whereof there is hope of Payment, and whereof the Sheriff is answerable, and Debts found in the Originals ('Õ). Of dead Ferms, and Debts desperate, whereof there is no Hope, one Roll shall be made, and [shall be intituled Comitatus, and read7] every Year upon the Accompt of Sheriffs; and the Debts whereof the Sheriffs are answerable shall be written in the an.nual Roll, and there shall be acquitted. Moreover, We will and provide, That it shall be proclaimed in every County, that all they that have Tallies of the Exche.quer, for the Debts of themselves or their Ancestors, hitherto paid usually there, and not yet allowed, which yet do come in the Summons of the Exchequer, they do deliver to the Sheriffs such Tallies, to be allowed at the Exchequer upon their Accompts; and the She.riffs shall make to them of whom they shall so receive Tallies their Writings, witnessing the Receipt of those Tallies, (Ò) and Occasion of the Debts: Two faithful Knights deputed thereunto, shall be present at the Re.ceipt of the Tallies aforesaid, between whom and the said Sheriffs Indentures snail be made of such Re.ceipts, [with9] the Seals of them both interchangeably. The foresaid Knights, deputed thereunto, shall send the Parts of their Indentures, at the Term appointed, unto

Moreover it shall be proclaimed, That except those that have such Tallies do deliver them to the Sheriffs and Knights, as afore is said, that then they shall be distrained for the whole Debt, and that the foresaid Tallies shall be reputed for unpaid. Moreover (1) the Debts which yet [are to come *3 in the Summons of the Exchequer, whereof the Debtors do proffer Tallies against divers Sheriffs, shall be de.falked and acquitted ; [Moreover we provide,3! That certain Persons assigned thereunto on our Behalf, shall be sent into every Shire, which shall have full Power to enquire of such manner of Debts; and also to call afore them [solemnly, as well the Sheriffs, as their Heirs and Assigns, and4] the Tenants of their Lands, in case they be dead that have received the Debts; and also, if need be, to proceed to the taking of [such manner of In.quests,Õ] whether the Parties, against whom the foresaid Tallies were shewed, do come or not; so that the Sheriff do return a reasonable Summons made to them there.fore ; and so the Truth being inquired and discussed in Presence of the Parties, if they will be there, the Inqui.sitors shall make Rolls [of them that shall be convift afore them ; so that the foresaid Debts being confessed and inrolled,6] the Tallies of the same shall be forthwith broken. And the Sheriffs shall have in their Custody the Transcripts of the same Rolls, under the Seals of the Inquisitors; and shall surcease in making Distresses for the Debts contained in the same, until they have otherwise in Commandment from Us therefore. And the foresaid Inquisitors shall send unto the Exchequer the foresaid Rolls under their Seals, that it may be examined there, by a Search to be made therefore, what Debts be paid in the Whole, and what are paid in Part, [and what Debts there be, whereof the Debtors be not acquitted,Õ] according as shall be convenient to be done. Moreover We will and provide, That the Chamberlains from henceforth shall not make to the Sheriffs, [or any of their Bailiffs,8] Tallies [of dividendis,9] unless they first receive of them [Writings containing the particular Sums of the Aftions of Debts,10] and the Names of them that paid them, [unto"] the which Particulars [he11] [may part the Names of such manner dividendis,'3] which being so received under their Seals, it shall not be lawful to [number Ò] them into other Particulars. Moreover We provide, That all Debts, whereunto the Sheriffs make Return, that the Debtors have nothing in their Bailiwicks, ne had not at such Time as they were charged with the same Debts, or that the Debtors be not found, that the same Debts shall be estreated (ls) in Rolls, and the same Rolls to be delivered unto faithful and circumspeft Men, which shall make Inquiry thereof after such Form as shall be provided by the Treasurer and Barons. [But for so much as certain Pleas were16] heretofore holden in the Exchequer, which did not concern Us nor our Ministers of the Exchequer, [whereby"Õ] as well our Pleas, as the Causes of our People, are unduly prorogued and letted ; We will and ordain, That (,8) no Plea shall be holden or pleaded in the Exchequer aforesaid, unless it do specially concern Us and our Ministers aforesaid. And therefore We command, That Ye cause the Premises to be distinctly and openly read afore you, and to inroll it, causing the same to be straitly observed in our Court of Exchequer aforesaid.

WHEREAS of late our Lord the King, in the Quinzim of Saint John Baptist, the Sixth Year of his Reign, calling together the Prelates, Earls, Ba.rons, and his Council at Gloucester, and considering that divers of this Realm were disherited, by reason that in many Cases, where Remedy should have been had there was none provided by him nor his Predecessors, ordained certain Statutes right necessary and profitable for his Realm, whereby the People of England and Ireland, being Subjects unto his Power, have obtained more speedy Justice in their Oppressions, than they had before; and certain Cases, wherein the Law failed, did re.main undetermined, and some (Ô) remained to be enaded, that were for the Reformation of the Oppressions of the People: Our Lord the King in his Parliament, after the Feast of Easter, holden the Thirteenth Year of his Reign at Westminster, caused many Oppressions [of the People,] and Defaults of the Laws, for the Accom.plishment of the said Statutes of Gloucester, to be rehearsed, and thereupon did provide certain Ads, as shall appear here following.

FIRST, Concerning Lands that many times are given upon Condition, that is to wit, Where any giveth his Land to any Man and his Wife, and to the Heirs be.gotten of the Bodies of the same Man and his Wife, with such Condition expressed that if the same Man and his Wife die without [Heirs Õ] of their Bodies between them begotten, the Land so given shall revert to the Giver or his Heir: In case also where one giveth Lands in free Marriage, which Gift hath a Condition annexed, though it be not expressed in the Deed of Gift, which is this, That if the Husband and Wife die without Heir of their Bodies begotten, the Land so given shall revert to the Giver or his Heir: In case also where one giveth Land to another, and the Heirs of his Body issuing ; it seemed very hard, and yet seemeth to the Givers and their Heirs, that their Will being expressed in the Gift, was not heretofore, nor yet is observed : (3) in all the Cases aforesaid, after Issue begotten and born between them, to whom the Lands were given under such Con.dition, heretofore such Feoffees had Power to aliene the Land so given, and to disherit their Issue of the Land, contrary to the Minds of the Givers, and contrary to the Form expressed in the Gift: And further, when the Issue of such Feoffee is failing, the Land so given ought to return to the Giver, or his Heir, by Form of tbc Gift expressed in the Deed, though the Issue, if any were, had died: Yet by the Deed and Feoffment of them, to whom Land was so given upon Condition, the Donors have heretofore been barred of their Reversion, which was direttly repugnant to the Perm of the Gift: Wherefore our Lord the King, perceiving how necessary and expedient it should be to provide Remedy in the aforesaid Cases, hath ordained, That the Will of the

Giver, according to the Form in the Deed of Gift ma.nifestly expressed, shall be from henceforth observed; so that they to whom the Land was given under such Condition, shall have ito Power to aliene the Land so given, but that it shall remain unto the Issue of them to whom it was given after their Death, or [shall revert] unto the Giver or his Heirs, if Issue fail [whereas'] there is no Issue at all, or if any Issue be, [and fail by Death, or Heir of the Body of such Issue failing.1] Neither shall the second Husband of any such Woman, from henceforth, have any thing in the Land so given upon Condition, after the Death of his Wife, by the Law of England, nor the Issue of the second Husband and Wife shall succeed in the Inheritance, but immediately after the Death of the Husband and Wife, to whom the Land was so given, it shall [come to their Issue, or return untos] the Giver, or his Heir, as before is said. And forasmuch as in a new Case new Remedy must be provided, this Manner of Writ shall be granted to the Party that will purchase it: [Precipe A. quod juste, &c. reddat E. manerium de F. cum suis pertinentiis, quod

C. dedit tali viro & tali mulieri, & haeredibus de ipsis viro & muliere exeuntibus.4] Or thus: [Quod C. dedit tali viro in liberum maritagium cum tali muliere, & quod post mortem praediftorum viri & mulieris, prae- difto B. filio eorundem viri & mulieris descendere debeat per formam donationis praediftae, ut dicit, &c. Vel, Quod C. dedit tali & haeredibus de corpore suo exe.untibus, & quod post mortem illius talis, praedifto B. filio praedifti talis descendere debeat per formam, &c.s] The Writ whereby the Giver shall recover, when Issue faileth, is common enough in the Chancery. And it is to wit that this Statute shall hold place touching Alienation of Land contrary to the Form of the Gift hereafter to be made, and shall not extend to Gifts made before. And if a Fine be levied hereafter upon such Lands, it shall be void in the Law ; neither shall the Heirs, or such as the Reversion belongeth unto, though they be of full Age, within England, and out of Prison, need to make their Claim.

FORASMUCH as Lords of Fees distraining their Tenants for Services [and Customs] due unto them, are many times grieved, because their Tenants do replevy the Distress by Writ, or without Writ; and when the Lords, at the Complaint of their Tenants, do come by Attachment into the County, or unto another Court, having Power to hold Pleas [of Withernam,6] and do avow the taking good and lawful, by reason that the Tenants disavow to hold ought, nor do claim to hold any thing of him which took the Distress and avowed it, he that distrained is amerced, and the Tenants go quit; to whom Punishment cannot be assigned for such disavowing by Record of the County, or of other Courts having no Record: It is Provided and ordained from henceforth, That where such Lords cannot obtain Justice in Counties and such manner of Courts against their Tenants, as soon as they shall be attached at the Suit of their Tenants, a Writ shall be granted to them to remove the Plea before the Justices, afore whom, and none other.where, Justice may be ministred unto such Lords; and the Cause shall be put in the Writ, because such a Man distrained in his Fee for Services and Customs to him due : Neither is this Aft prejudicial to the Law com.monly used, which did not permit that any Plea should be moved before Justices at the Suit of the Defendant; for though it appear at the first shew that the Tenant is Plaintiff, and the Lord Defendant, nevertheless, having respeft to that, that the Lord hath distrained, and sueth for Services and Customs being behind, he appeareth indeed to be rather Aftor, or Plaintiff, than Defendant.

£n<? c0 the Jntent JU8,ices may know upon what fresh betsin the Lords may avow the Distress reasonable UP¡" "^Tenants; from henceforth It is agreed and enacted. That a reasonable Distress may be avowed upon the Seisin of any Ancestor or Predecessor [since a j i!me *^at.a Writ ¡f Novel disseisin hath run.1] And because it chanceth sometimes that the Tenant, after that he hath replevied his Beasts, doth sell or [alteneÔJ them, whereby Return cannot be made unto the Lord that distrained, if it be adjudged : It is pro- vided, That Sheriffs or Bailiffs from henceforth shall not only receive of the Plaintiffs Pledges for the pur.suing of the Suit, before they make Deliverance of the Distress, but also for the Return of the Beasts, if Re.turn be awarded. And if any take Pledges otherwise, he shall answer for the Price of the Beasts, and the Lord that distraineth shall have his Recovery by Writ, that he shall restore unto him so many Beasts or Cattle; and if the Bailiff be not able to restore, his Superior shall restore. And forasmuch as it hapneth sometime, that after the Return of the Beasts is awarded unto the Distrainor, and the Party so distrained, after that the Beasts be returned, doth replevy them again, and when he seeth the Distrainor appearing in the Court ready to answer him, doth make Default, whereby Return of the Beasts ought to be awarded again unto the Dis.trainor, and so the Beasts be replevied twice or thrice, and infinitely, and the Judgements given in the KingÕs Court take no Effett in this Case, whereupon no Re.medy hath been yet provided ; in this case such Process [shall be awarded,3] that so soon as Return of the Beasts shall be awarded to the Distrainor, the Sheriff shall be commanded by a judicial Writ to make Return of the Beasts unto the Distrainor ; in which Writ it shall be expressed, that the Sheriff shall not deliver them without Writ, making mention of the Judgement given by the Justices, which cannot be without a Writ issuing out of the Rolls of the said Justices before whom the Matter was moved. Therefore when he cometh unto the Justices, and desireth (4) Replevin of the Beasts, he shall have a judicial Writ, that the She.riff taking Surety for the Suit, and also of the Beasts or Cattle to be returned, or the Price of them, if Re.turn be awarded, shall deliver unto him the Beasts or Cattle before returned, and the Distrainor shall be at.tached to come at a certain Day before the Justices, afore whom the Plea [was moved,3] in Presence of the Parties. And if he that replevied make Default again, or for an.other cause Return of the Distress be awarded, being now twice replevied, [the6] Distress shall remain (7) irrepleviable ; but if a Distress be taken of new, and for a new Cause, the Process abovesaid shall be observed in the same new Distress.

IN case when a Man doth lose by Default the Land which was the Right of his Wife, it was very haid that the Wife, after the Death of her Husband, had none other Recovery but by a Writ of Right; wherefore our Lord the King hath ordained, That a Woman, after the Death of her Husband, shall recover by a Writ of Entry, [whereto she could not disagree during his Life,*] which shall be pleaded in Form under-written: If the Tenant do except against the Demand of the Wife, that he entered by Judgement, and it be found that his Entry was by Default, whereto the Tenant of Necessity must make Answer, if it be demanded of him, then he shall be compelled to make further Answer, and to shew his Right according to the Form of the Writ that he purchased before against the Husband and the Wife. And if he can verify that he hath [or had] Right in the Land demanded, the Woman shall gain nothing by her Writ; which Thing if he cannot shew, the Woman shall recover the Land in Demand; this being ob.served, that if the Husband absent himself, and will not defend his WifeÕs Right, or against his WifeÕs Consent will render the Land, if the Wife do come before Judge.ment, ready to answer the Demandant, and to defend

. from the time that the Writ of Novel disseisin doth run.

her Right, the Wife shall be admitted. Likewise if Tenant in Dower, Tenant by the Law of the Land, or otherwise for Term of Life, or by Gift, where the Re.version is reserved, do make Default, or will give up ; the Heirs, and they unto whom the Reversion belongeth, shall be admitted to their Answer if they come before Judgement: And if upon such Default, or Surrender, Judgement hap to be given, then the Heirs, or they unto whom the Reversion belongeth after the Death of such Tenants, shall have their Recovery by a Writ of Entry, in which like Process shall be observed as is aforesaid, in case where the Husband loseth his WifeÕs Land [by Default]; and so in the Cases aforesaid two Actions do concur, one between the Demandant and Tenant, and another between the Tenant shewing his Right, and the Demandant.

IN Case where the Husband, being impleaded for Land, [giveth up the Land demanded unto his Adver.sary by Covin'] after the Death of the Husband, the Justices [shall award *] the Wife her Dower, if it be demanded by Writ; but in case where the Husband loseth the Land in demand by Default, if the Wife, after the Death of her Husband, demandeth her Dower, it hath been [proved,1 * * *] that some Justices have awarded unto the Woman her Dower notwithstanding the De.fault which her Husband made, other Justices being of the contrary Opinion, and judging otherwise; to the intent that from henceforth such Ambiguity shall be taken away, It is thus Ordained in certain, That in both Cases the Woman demanding her Dower shall be heard: And if it be alledged against her, that her Husband lost the Land, whereof the Dower is demanded, by Judge.ment, whereby she ought not to have Dower, and then it be enquired by what Judgement, and it be found that it was by Default, whereunto the Tenant must answer; then it behoveth the Tenant to answer further, and to shew that he had Right, and hath in the foresaid Land, according to the Form of the Writ that the Tenant be.fore purchased against the Husband. And if he can shew that the Husband of such Wife had no Right in the Lands, nor any other but he that holdeth them, the Tenant shall go quit, and the Wife shall recover nothing of her Dower ; which Thing if he cannot shew, the Wife shall recover her Dower. And so in these Cases, and in certain other following, that is to say, When the Wife being endowed loseth her Dower by Default, and Te.nants in free Marriage, by the Law of England, or for Term of Life, or in Feetail, divers Adions do concur; for such Tenants, when they must demand their Land lost by Default, and when it is come to that Point, that the Tenants must be compelled to shew their Right, they cannot make Answer without them to whom the Reversion of Right belongeth : Therefore it is granted unto them to vouch to Warranty, as if they were Te.nants, if they have a Warranty. And when the War.rantor hath warranted, the Plea shall pass between hint that is seised and the Warrantor, according to the Te.nor of the Writ that the Tenant purchased before, and by which he recovered by Default; and so from many Adions at length they shall resort to one Judgement, which is this, That the Demandants shall recover their Demand, or the Tenants shall go quit. And if the Adion of such a Tenant, which is compelled to shew his Right, be moved by a Writ of Right, though that the great Assise or Battail cannot be joyned by the Words accustomed, yet it shall be joined by Words conve.nient (*): For [when5] the Tenant, in that he sheweth his Right which belongeth to him by the Writ that he before purchased, (6) instead of a Demandant, the War.rantor may well defend the Right of the Tenant, which is accounted in Place of the Demandant as before is said, and offer to defend the Seisin of his Ancestors by the Body of his Freeman, or put himself [inJ] the great Assise, and pray Recognizance to be made, whether he hath more Right to the Land in Demand, or else the Patty before named; or otherwise the great Assise

And sometimes when an Agreement is made between many claiming one Advowson, and inrolled before the Justices in the Roll, or by Fine, in this Form, that one shall present the first Time, and at the next Avoidance another, and the third Time another ; and so of many, in case there be many : And when one hath presented, and had his Presentation, which he ought to have according to the Form of [their Agreement and Fine *] and at the next Avoidance he to whom the second Presentation belongeth, is disturbed by any that was Party to [the said Fine,8] or by some other in his stead ; It is Provided, That from henceforth they that be so disturbed shall have no need to sue a Quare Impedit, but shall resort to the Roll or Fine -t and if the said Concord or Agreement be found in the Roll or Fine, then the Sheriff shall be com.manded, that he give Knowledge unto the Disturber, that he be ready at some short Day, containing the Space of Fifteen Days, or three Weeks, as the Place hap- peneth to be near or far, for to shew if he can alledge any Thing, wherefore the Party that is disturbed ought not to present: And if he come not, or peradventure doth come, and can alledge nothing to bar the Party of his Presentation by reason of any Deed made [or written9] since the Fine was made or inrolled, he shall recover his Presentation with his Damages.

And where it chanceth that after the Death of the for

Ancestor [of him1] that presented his Clerk unto a fpãllnT- Church, the same Advowson is assigned in Dower to t;on ,fur a any Woman, or to Tenant by the Curtesie, which do particular present, and after the Death of such Tenants the very estate ended. Heir is disturbed to present when the Church is void,

It is Provided, That from henceforth it shall be in the Eleftion of the Party disturbed, whether he will sue a Writ of Quare Impedit, or of Darrein Presentment.

The same shall be observed in Advowsons demised for Term of Life, or Years, or in Fee-tail. And from Damage* henceforth in Writs of Quare Impedit and Darrein Pre- J^Q^iTaiid sentment, Damages shall be awarded, that is to wit, E>arrejn If the Time of Six Months pass by the Disturbance of preKntment. any, so that the Bishop do confer to the Church, and the very Patron loseth his Presentation for that Time,

Damages^ shall be awarded [Õfor Two Years value of the Church. And if the Six Months be not passed, but the Presentment be [deraignedJ] within the said Time, then Damages shall be awarded to the Half-yearÕs Value of the Church ;*] and if the Disturber have not whereof he may recompense Damages, in case where the Bishop conferreth by Lapse of Time, he shall be punished by Two YearsÕ Imprisonment: And if the Advowson be [deraigned3] within the Half-year, yet the Disturber shall be punished by the Imprisonment of Half a Year.

And from henceforth Writs shall be granted for Chapels, Writ* for Prebends, Vicarages, Hospitals, Abbeys, Priories, and other Houses which be of the Advowsons of [other J] vicarage*, Men, that have not been used to be granted before. &c And when the Parson of any Church is disturbed to de.mand Tythes in the next Parish by a Writ of Indicavit, the Patron of the Parson so disturbed, shall have a Writ to demand the Advowson of the Tythes being in de.mand ; and when it is [deraigned,6] then shall the Plea pass in the Court Christian, as far forth as it is [de.raigned 6] in the KingÕs Court. When an Advowson Usurpation descendeth unto Parceners, though one present twice, Copareencr and usurpeth upon his Coheir, yet he that was negligent upon another. shall not be clearly barred, but another Time shall have his Turn to present when it falleth.

WHEN any demandeth Land against another, and the Party that is impleaded voucheth to Warranty, and the Warrantor denieth his Warranty, and the Plea hangeth long between the Tenant and the Warrantor ; and at length, when it is tried, that the Vouchee is bound to Warranty, by the Law and Custom of the Realm hitherto used there was none other Punishment assigned for the Vouchee that denieth his Warranty, but only that he should warrantize, and should be amerced, because he did not warrant before ; which was prejudicial unto the Demandant, because he suffered oftentimes great Delays by Collusion between the Tenant and the Warrantor: Wherefore our Lord the King hath or.dained, That like as the Tenant should leese the Land being in Demand, in case where he vouched, and the Vouchee could discharge himself of the Warranty, in the same wise shall the Warrantor leese in case where he denieth his Warranty, and it be tried against him that he is bounden to Warranty. And if an Inquest be depending between the Tenant and the Warrantor, and the Demandant will require a Writ to cause the Jury to come, it shall be granted him.

VI.

The Penalty where the Vouchee denieth his Warranty.

A Venire Facias at the DemandantÕa Requeat.

A WRIT of Admeasurement of Dower shall be from henceforth granted to a Guardian ; neither shall the Heir, when he cometh to full Age, be barred by the Suit of such a Guardian, that sueth against the Tenant in Dower feignedly, and by Collusion, but that he may admeasure the Dower, after as it ought to be admeasured by the Law of England. And as well in this Writ, as in a Writ of Admeasurement of Pasture, more speedy Process shall be awarded than hath been used hitherto; so that when it is come unto the great Distress, Days shall be given, within which Two Counties 1 ay be holden, at the which open Proclamation shall be made, that the Defendant shall come in at the Day contained in the Writ, to answer to the Plaintiff;

The Writ of Mesne, and new Process therein.

at which Day, if he come in, the Plea shall pass between them ; and if he do not come, and the Proclamation be testified by the Sheriff in manner abovesaid, upon his Default they shall make Admeasurement.

WHEREAS by a Plea moved upon a Writ of Ad.measurement of Pasture, the Pasture was sometime admeasured before the Justices, sometime before the Sheriff in the County, and it chanced many Times, after such Admeasurement made, the Pasture to be over.charged again by him that first did it, with more Beasts than he ought to keep, whereupon no Remedy hath been yet provided; It is ordained, That upon the second Overcharge, the Plaintiff shall have Remedy in this manner: If the Admeasurement were before the Justices, the Plaintiff shall have a Writ judicial, that the Sheriff in Presence of the Parties being summoned, if they will come, shall inquire upon the second Overcharge; which if it be found, it shall be returned before the Justices, under the Seals of the Sheriff, and the Seals of the Jurors; and the Justices shall award the Plaintiff Da.mages, and shall put in the Extreats the Value of the Beasts which [were '] put into the Pasture after such Admeasurement more than he ought, and shall deliver the Extreats unto the Barons of the Exchequer, whereof they shall answer unto the King. If such Admeasure.ment were made in the County, then, at the Request of the Plaintiff, a Writ shall go out of the Chancery, that the Sheriff shall inquire of such Overcharge; and for the Beasts put in the Pasture above the due Number, or for the Value of them, he shall answer to the King at the Exchequer. And lest the Sheriff might defraud the King in this case, it is agreed, that all such Writs De secunda Superoneratione, that pass out of the Chan.cery, shall be inrolled, and at the YearÕs End the Transcripts shall be sent into the Exchequer under the ChancellorÕs Seal, that the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer may see how the Sheriff doth answer of the Issues of such Writs ; in the same wise Writs of Redis.seisin shall be inrolled and sent into the Exchequer at the YearÕs End.

WHEN Chief Lords distrain in their Fee for Customs and Services to them due, and there is a Mean which ought to acquit the Tenant, sithence it lieth not in the Mouth of the Tenant, after that he hath replevied the Distress, to deny the Demand of the Chief Lord, which avoweth in the KingÕs Court, that the Distress is law.fully taken upon his Tenant, which is upon the Mean ; and many have been heretofore sore grieved by such Distresses, in so much as the Mean, notwithstanding that he hath whereby he may be distrained, doth make long delays before he will come into the Court to answer [for his Tenant1] unto the Writ of Mean; and further, the Case was most hard when the Mean had nothing; In case also when the Tenant was ready to do his Ser.vices and Customs unto his Lord, and the Chief Lord would refuse to take such Services and Customs by the Hands of any other than of his next Tenant, and so such Tenants in Demean lost somewhiles the Profits of their Lands for a Time, and somewhiles for their whole Time, and hitherto no Remedy hath been provided in this Case: A Remedy is Provided and Ordained here.after in this Form ; That so soon as such Tenant in Demean, having a Mean between him and the Chief Lord, is distrained, incontinent the Tenant shall pur.chase his Writ of Mean; and if the Mean, having Land in the same County, absent himself until the great Dis.tress awarded, the Plaintiff shall have such Day given him in his Writ of great Distress, afore the coming whereof two Counties may be holden, and the Sheriff shall be commanded to distrain the Mean by the great Distress, like as it is contained in the Writ, and never.theless the Sheriff in two full Counties shall cause to be proclaimed solemnly, that the Mean do come at a Day contained in the Writ, to answer his Tenant; at which Day, if he come, the Plea shall pass between them after the common Usage; and if he do not come, then such Mesne shall lose the Services of his Tenant,

and from thenceforth the Tenant shall not answer him in any thing; but, the same Mean being excluded, he shall answer unto the Chief Lord for such Services and Customs [as before he ought to have done to the same Mean;'] neither shall the Chief Lord have Power to distrain, so long as the aforesaid Tenant doth offer him the Services and Customs due; and if the Chief Lord exaft more than the Mean [ought to do,Õ] the Tenant in such Case shall have such Exceptions as the Mean should. And if the Mean have nothing within the KingÕs Dominion, the Tenant shall nevertheless pur.chase his Writ of Mean to the Sheriff of the same Shire wherein he is distrained. And if the Sheriff return, that he hath nothing whereby he may be summoned [then3] shall the Tenant sue his Writ of Attachment. And if the Sheriff return, that he hath nothing to be attached by, he shall nevertheless sue his Writ of Great Distress, and Proclamation shall be made in Form abovesaid. And if the Mean have no Land in the Shire where the Distress is taken, but hath Land in some other Shire, then a Writ Original shall issue, to summon the Mean, unto the Sheriff of the same Shire where the Distress is taken, and when it is returned by the Sheriff that he hath nothing in his Shire, a Writ Judicial shall issue, to summon the Mean, unto the Sheriff of the same Shire in which it shall be testified that he hath Land, and Suit shall be made in the same Shire until they have passed unto the Great Distress and Proclamation, as above is said [in4] the Mean having Land in the same Shire in which the Distress is taken; and nevertheless Suit shall be made in the same Shire where he hath nothing, as above is said of the Mean that hath nothing, until the Process come to the Great Distress and Proclamation ; and so after Proclamation made in both Counties, the Mean shall be forejudged of his Fee and Service. And where it happeneth some.times, that the Tenant in Demean is infeoffed to hold by less Service than the Mean ought to do unto the Chief Lord, when after such Proclamation the Tenant hath attorned to the Chief Lord, and, the Mean being excluded, the Tenant must of Necessity answer unto the Chief Lord for all such Services and Customs as the Mean was wont to do to him ; And after that the Mean is come into the Court, and hath confessed that he ought to acquit his Tenant, or be compelled by Judgement to acquit, if after such Confession or Judge.ment it is complained that the Mean doth not acquit his Tenant, then shall issue a Writ Judicial, that the Sheriff shall distrain the Mean to acquit the Tenant, and to be at a certain Day before the Justicers, for to shew why he hath not acquitted him before ; and when [they have proceeded unto the Great Distress,5] the Plaintiff shall be heard ; and if the Plaintiff can prove, that he hath not acquitted him, he shall yield Damages, and by Award of the Court the Tenant shall go quit from the Mean, and shall attorn unto the Chief Lord. And if he come not at the first Distress, a Writ shall go forth to distrain him again, and Proclamation shall be made, and as soon as it is returned, they shall proceed [in6] Judgement, as before is said. And it is to be under- standen, that by this Statute Tenants are not excluded, but they shall have a Warranty of the Means and their Heirs, if they be impleaded of their Lands, as they have had before. Nor the Tenants shall be excluded, but that they may sue against their Means, as they used heretofore, if they see that their Process may be more available by the old Custom, than by this Statute. And it is to wit, that by this Statute no Remedy is provided to any Means, but only in case where there is but one only Mean between the Lord that distraineth and the Tenant; and in case where that Mean is of full Age; and in case where the Tenant may attorn unto the chief Lord, without Prejudice of any other than of the Mean, which is spoken for Women Tenants in Dower, and Te.nants by the Courtesie, or otherwise for Term of Life, or in Fee-tail, unto whom for certain Causes Remedy is not yet provided, but, God willing, there shall be at another Time.

WHEREAS in the Circuit of Justices it was pro.claimed, That all such as would deliver Writs, should deliver them within a certain Time, after which no Writ should be received ; many trusting upon the same, and tarrying until the said Time, and no Writ served upon them, departed by Licence of the said Justices ; after whose Departure their Adversaries, perceiving their Ab.sence, delivered their Writs in Wax, which sometime by Fraud, and sometimes for Rewards, be received of the Sheriff, and they, that thought to have departed quiet, lose their Lands : For the Remedy of such Fraud, from henceforth, the King hath ordained, That the Jus.tices in their Circuits shall appoint a Time of Fifteen Days, or a Month, [or' ] a Time more or less, after as the County shall happen to be more or less, within which Time it shall be openly proclaimed, that all such as will deliver their Writs, shall deliver them before the same Time; and when the Time cometh, the Sheriff shall certifie the Chief Justice in Eyre how many Writs he hath, and what, and that no Writ be received after the same Time; and if it be received, the Process is.suing thereupon shall be of none Effed ; but only that a Writ abated any Time during the Circuit may be amended ; also Writs of Dower of Men that died within the Summons of the Circuit, Assises of Darrain pre.sentment, Quare impedit, of Churches vacant within the foresaid Summons, shall be received at any Time be.fore the Departure of the Justices ; also Writs of Novel disseisin, at what Time soever the Disseisin was done, shall be received [in the Circuit of Justices.1] Our Lord the King of his special Grace granteth, That such as have Land in divers Shires where the Justices make their Circuit, [and that have Land in Shires where the Justices have no Circuit, that fear to be impleaded,Õ] and are impleaded of other Lands in Shires where they have no Circuit, as before the Justices at Westminster, or in the KingÕs Bench, or before Justices assigned to take Assises, or in any County before Sheriffs, or in any Court Baron, may make a general Attorney to sue for them in all Pleas in the Circuit of Justices moved or to be moved for them, or against them, during the Circuit; which Attorney or Attorneys shall have full Power in all Pleas moved during the Circuit, until the Plea be determined, or that his Master remove him ; yet shall they not be excused thereby, but they shall be put in Juries and Assises before the same Justices.

CONCERNING Servants, Bailiffs, Chamberlains, and all Manner of Receivers, which are bound to yield Accompt, It is agreed and ordained, That when the Masters of such Servants do assign Auditors to take their Accompt, and they be found in Arrearages upon the Ac.compt, [all Things allowed which ought to be allowed,] their Bodies shall be arrested, and, by the Testimony of the Auditors of the same Accompt, shall be sent or de.livered unto the next Gaol of the KingÕs in those Parts; and shall be received of the Sheriff or Gaoler, and im.prisoned in Iron under safe Custody, and shall remain in the same Prison at their own Cost, until they have satisfied their Master fully of the Arrearages. Never.theless if any Person being so committed to Prison, do complain, that the Auditors of his Accompt have grieved him unjustly, charging him with Receipts that he hath not received, or not allowing him Expences, or reasonable Disbursements, and can find Friends that will undertake to bring him before the Barons of the Exchequer, he shall be delivered unto them; and the Sheriff, in whose Prison he is kept, shall give Know.ledge unto his Master, that he appear before the Barons of the Exchequer at a certain Day, with the Rolls and Tallies by which he made his Accompt; and in the Presence of the Barons, or the Auditors that they shall assign him, the Accompt shall be rehearsed, and Justice shall be done to the Parties, so that if he be found in Arrearages, he shall be committed to the Fleet, as above is said. And if he 0ee, and will not give Accompt willingly, as is contained elsewhere in other Statutes, he shall be distrained to come before the Justices to make his Account, if he have whereof to be distrained.

And let the Sheriff or Keeper of such Gaol take heed, if it be within a Franchise, or without, that he do not suffer him to go out of Prison by the common Writ called Replegiare, or by other means, without assent of his Master; and if he do, and thereof be convid, he shall be answerable to his Master of the Damages done to him by such his Servant, according as it may be found by the Country, and (*) shall have his Recovery by Writ of Debt. And if the Keeper of the Gaol have not wherewith he may be justified, or [not able Õ] to pay, his Superior, that committed the Custody of the Gaol unto him, shall be answerable by the same Writ.

FORASMUCH as many, through Malice intending to grieve other, do procure false Appeals to be made of Homicides and other Felonies by Appellors, having no.thing to satisfy the King for their false Appeal, nor to the Parties appealed for their Damages, It is ordained, That when any, being appealed of Felony surmised upon him, doth acquit himself in the KingÕs Court in due Manner, either at the Suit of the Appellor, or of our Lord the King, the Justices, before whom the Appeal shall be heard and determined, shall punish the Appellor by a YearÕs Imprisonment, and the Appellors shall nevertheless restore to the Parties appealed their Damages, according to the Discretion of the Justices, having resped to the Imprisonment or Arrestment that the Party appealed hath sustained by reason of such Appeals, and to the Infamy that they have incurred by the Imprisonment or otherwise, and shall nevertheless make a grievous Fine unto the King. And if perad- venture such Appellor be not able to recompense the Damages, it shall be inquired by whose Abetment or Malice the Appeal was commenced, if the Party appealed desire it; and if it be found by the same Inquest, that any Man is Abettor through Malice, at the Suit of the Party appealed he shall be distrained by a judicial Writ to come before the Justices; and if he be lawfully con.vid of such malicious Abetment, he shall be punished by Imprisonment and Restitution of Damages, as before is said of the Appellor. And from .henceforth in Ap.peal of the Death of a Man there shall no Essoin lie for the Appellor, in whatsoever Court the Appeal shall hap to be determined.

FORASMUCH as Sheriffs, feigning many Times certain Persons to be indided before them in their Turns of Felonies and other Trespasses, do take Men that are not culpable nor lawfully indided, and imprison them, and do exad Money from them, whereas they were not lawfully indicted by twelve Jurors; It is ordained, That Sheriffs in their Turns, and in other Places [where they have Power4] to enquire of Trespassers by the KingÕs Precept, or by Office, shall cause their Inquests of such Malefadors to be taken by lawful Men, and by Twelve at the least, which shall put their Seals to such Inqui.sitions ; and those that shall be found culpable by such Inquests, they shall take and imprison, as they have used aforetimes to do: and if they do imprison other than such as have been indicted by Inquest, the Parties im.prisoned shall have their Adion by a Writ of Imprison.ment against the Sheriffs, as they should have against any other Person that should imprison them without Warrant; and as it hath been said of Sheriffs, so shall it be observed of every Bailiff of Franchise.

WHEREAS for Waste done in the Inheritance of any Person, by Guardians, Tenants in Dower, Tenants by the Courtesie of England, or otherwise for Term of Life, [or Years,] a Writ of Prohibition of Waste hath been used to be granted, by which Writs many were deceived, thinking that such as had done the Waste

IN case where Inheritance descendeth to one within Age of the FatherÕs side, that held of one Lotd, and the MotherÕs side that held of another Lord, there hath been hitherto Doubt, for the Marriage of such an Heir, to which of the two Lords it should belong; It is agreed, That the same Lord shall from henceforth have the Mar.

XVII. IN the Circuit of the Justices an Essoign De malo De miLlefti* shall not be from henceforth allowed for Lands in the same Shire, unless he that caused himself to be essoined be sick indeed ; for if the Demandant except, that the Tenant is not sick, nor in such Plight but that he may come before the Justices, his Exception shall be admitted. And if it can be so proved by Enquest, the F.ssoign shall be turned to a Default: And from hence.forth such Essoin shall not lie in a Writ of Right be.tween two claiming by one Descent.

WHEN Debt is recovered or knowledged in the KingÕs Court, or Damages awarded, it shall be from henceforth in the Elettion of him that sueth for such Debt or Darttages, [to have a Wiit of Fieri facias unto the Sheriff for to levy the Debt2] of the Lands and Goods j or that the Sheriff shall deliver to him all the Chattels of the Debtor, saving only his Oxen and Beasts of his Plough, and the one half of his Land, until the Debt be levied upon a reasonable Price or Extent: And if he be put out of that Tenement, he shall recover by a Writ of Novel disseisin, and after by a Writ of Redisseisin, if need be.

XIX. WHEREAS after the Death of a Person dying intes- TUe Ordinary tate? which is bounden to some other for Debt, the chargeable Goods come to the Ordinary to be disposed ; the Ordi- Debts of'an nary from henceforth shall be bound to answer the Inteatate. Debts as far forth as the Goods of the Dead will extend, in such sort as the Executors of the same Party should have been bounden, if he had made a Testament.

For the Heir against Heir, or Alienee.

WHEREAS two or more do hold Wood, Turf- land, or Fishing, or other such thing in common, wherein none knoweth his several, and some of them do Waste against the Minds of the other, an A&ion may lie by a Writ of Waste; and when it is come unto Judgement, the Defendant shall choose either to take his Part in a Place certain, by the Sheriff, and by the View, Oath, and Assignment of his Neighbours, [sworn and tried *] for the same Intent, or else he shall grant to take nothing from henceforth in the same Wood, Turf-land, and such other, but as his Partners will take; and if he do choose to take his Part in a Place certain, the Part wasted shall be assigned for his Part, [as it was3] before he committed the Waste. And [thereis such a Writ4] in this Case, that is to say; [Cum A. & B. tenent boscum pro indiviso, B. fecit vastum, &c.>]

EXECUTORS from henceforth shall have a Writ of Accompt, and the same Aftion and Process, in the same Writ, as the Testator [might have had4] if he had lived.

IN Cases whereas a Writ is granted out of the Chancery for [the Fad of another,5] the Plaintiffs from henceforth shall not depart from the KingÕs Court without Remedy, because the Land is transferred from one to another, and in the Register of the Chancery there is no special Writ found in this Case; as of a House, a Wall, a Market, [but the Writ is granted *] against him that levied [the Nusance] ; and if the House, Wall, or such like be aliened to another, the Writ [shall not be denied9] ; but from henceforth, where in one Case a Writ is granted, in like Case,

Ewhen like Remedy falleth, the Writ shall be made as ath been used before.'"] [Questus est nobis A. quod

D. injuste, &c. levavit domum, murum, mercatum, & alia quae sunt ad nocumentum, &c."] And if such Things levied be aliened from one to another, the Writ shall be thus: [Questus est nobis A. quod B. & C. le.vaverunt, &c."] In like Manner, as a Parson of a Church may recover Common of Pasture by Writ of Novel Disseisin, likewise from henceforth his Successor shall have a Quod permittat against the Disseisor or his Heir, though a like Writ were never granted out of the Chancery before. And in like Manner, as a Writ is granted to try whether Land be the free Alms of such a Church, or the Lay Fee of such a Man, even so from henceforth a Writ shall be made to try whether it be the free Aims of this Church, or of another Church, in case where the free Alms of one Church is transferred to the Possession of another Church.

And whensoever from henceforth it shall fortune in the Chancery, that in one Case a Writ is found, and in like Case falling under like Law, and requiring like Remedy, is found none, the Clerks of the Chancery

FORASMUCH as there is no Writ in the Chancery whereby Plaintiffs can have so speedy Remedy, as by a Writ of Novel disseisin; Our Lord the King, willing that Justice may be speedily ministred, and that Delays in Pleas may be taken away or abridged, granteth that a Writ of Novel disseisin shall hold place in more Cases than it hath done heretofore; and granteth, that for Estovers of Wood, Profit to be taken in Woods by ga.thering of Nuts, Acoms, and other Fruits, for a Corody, for Delivery of Corn and other Vi&uals and Necessaries to be received yearly in a Place certain, Toll, Tronage, Passage, Pontage, [Pawnage,] and such like, to be taken in Places certain, keeping of Parks, Woods, Fo.rests, Chases, Warrens, Gates, and other Bailiwicks, and Offices in Fee, from henceforth an Assise of Novel disseisin shall lie; and in all Cases afore rehearsed, according to the accustomed Manner, the Writ shall be De libero tenemento; and as before times it hath lien and holden Place in Common of Pasture, so shall it from henceforth hold Place in Common of Turf-land, Fishing, and such like Commons, which any Man hath appendant to Freehold, or without Freehold by special Deed, at the least for Term of Life. In case also when any holding (6) for Term of Years, or in Ward, alieneth the same in Fee, and by such Alienation the Freehold is transferred to the Feoffee, the Remedy shall be by a Writ of Novel disseisin, and as well the Feoffor as the Feoffee shall be had for Disseisors, so that during the Life of any of them the said Writ shall hold place; and if by the Death of the Parties, Remedy happen to fail by that Writ, then Remedy shall be obtained by a Writ of Entry. And albeit that above mention is made of some Cases wherein a Writ of Novel disseisin held no Place before, let no Man think therefore that this Writ lieth not now where it hath lien before; and though some have doubted whether a Remedy be had by this Writ in case where one feedeth in the Several of another, let it be had for certain, that a good and a sure Remedy is given in that Case by the said Writ. And let them which be named Disseisors beware from henceforth that they alledge not false Exceptions, whereby the taking of the Assise may be deferred, say.ing, that another Time an Assise of the same Land passed between the same Parties, or saying, and falsly, that a Writ of more high Nature hangeth between the same Parties for the same Land, and upon these and like Matters do vouch Rolls or Records to Warranty, to the end that by the same vouching they may take away the Vesture, and receive the Rents and other Pro.fits, to the great Damage of the Plaintiff. And where before none other Pain was limited against him that falsly had alledged such untrue Exceptions, but only that, after such false Surmises disproved, the Assise should pass; our Lord the King, to whom such false Exceptions be odious, hath ordained, That if any being named Disseisor do personally alledge the Exception at the Day to him given, if he fail of the Warranty that he hath vouched he shall be adjudged for a Disseisor without taking of the Assise, and shall restore the Da.mages before inquired of, or to be inquired after, to the Double, and shall nevertheless have a Year's Im.prisonment for his Falshood. And if that Exception be alledged by a Bailiff, the taking of the Assise shall not be delayed therefore, nor the Judgement upon the Restitution of the Lands and Damages; yet never.theless, that if the Master of such a Bailiff that was absent, come after before the same Justices that took the Assise, and offer to prove by Record or Rolls, that another Time an Assise passed between the

sajne Paries of the same Land, or that the Plaintiff at an.other lime did withdraw his Suit in a like Writ, or that a Plea hangeth by a Writ of more high Nature, a Writ [of Venire facias shall be granted unto him to cause the same Record to be brought;1] and when he hath the same, and the Justices do perceive, that the Record so [shewed by him*] would have been so available before the Judgement, that the Plaintiff by force of the same should have been barred of his Aflion, the Justices shall presently cause the Party to be warned that first reco.vered, that he appear at a certain Day, at the which the Defendant shall have again his Seisin and Damages, if he before paid any by the first Judgement (Õ) given, which shall be restored him to the Double, as before is said ; and also he that first recovered shall be punished by Im.prisonment according to the Discretion of the Justices. In the same manner if the Defendant, against whom the Assise passed in his absence, shew any Deeds or Releases, upon the making whereof the Jury were not examined, nor could be examined, because there was no mention made of them in pleading, and [by probabi.lity *] might be ignorant of the making of those Writ.ings ; the Justices upon the Sight of those Writings shall cause the Party to be warned that recovered, that he appear at a certain day, and shall cause the Jurors of the same Assise to come; and if he shall verify those Writings to be true by the Verditt of the Jurors, or by Inrollment, he that purchased the Assise contrary to his own Deed, shall be punished by the Pain aforesaid. And the Sheriff from henceforth shall not take an Ox of the Disseisee, but of the Disseisor only ; and if there be many Disseisors named in one Writ, yet shall he be contented with one Ox; nor shall receive any Ox but of [vs.7] Price, or the Value.

IN Writs of Redisseisin from henceforth double Da.mages shall be awarded, and the Redisseisors shall not be repleviable hereafter by the common Writ; and like as in the Statute of Merton the same Writ was pro.vided for such as were disseised after they had reco.vered by Assise of Novel Disseisin, of Mortdauncestor, or other [Jurates ;6] even so from henceforth the same Writ shall further hold place for them that shall recover by Default, Reddition, or otherwise, without Recogni.tion of Assises or [Jurates.6]

AFTER any hath put himself [to an Inquest,7] an Essoin shall be allowed him at the next Day; but [all *] the other Days following, the taking of the Inquest shall not be delayed by the Essoin, whether he were essoined before, or no; neither shall any Essoin be allowed after Day given Prece partium, in case where the Parties consent to come without Essoin.

WHEREAS by the Statute of Westminster the First, it was provided, That after the Tenants have once ap.peared in the Court, no Essoin should be allowed them in Writs of Assises; In like Manner it shall be from henceforth observed against the Demandants.

A WRIT of Trespass, ad audiendum & terminandum, from henceforth shall not be granted before any Jus.tices, except Justices of either Bench, and Justices in Eyre, unless it be for an heinous Trespass, where it is necessary to provide speedy Remedy, and our Lord the King of his special Grace hath thought it good to be granted. And from henceforth a Writ to hear and de.termine Appeals before Justices assigned shall not be granted but in a special Case, and for a Cause certain, when the King commandeth. But lest the Parties ap.pealed or indited be kept long in Prison, they shall have a Writ of Odio & Atia, like as it is declared in Magna Charta and other Statutes.

But from henceforth the Justices of the Bench in such Assises shall give four Days at the least in the Year [before the said Justices assigned, for to spare Expence and Labour : Inquisitions of Trespass shall be deter.

And if any In.quisitions be taken otherwise than after this Form, they shall be of no Effed, except that an Assise of Darrein presentment, and Inquisitions of Quare impedit shall be determined in their own Shire before one Justice of the Bench and one Knight, at a Day and Place certain in the Bench assigned, whether the Defendant consent or not, and there the Judgement shall be given immediately: All Justices of the Benches [from henceforth shall have in their Circuits5 ] Clerks to inroll all Pleas pleaded be.fore them, like as they have used to have in Time passed. And also It is Ordained, That the Justices assigned to take Assises shall not compel the Jurors to say precisely whether it be Disseisin or not, so that they do shew the Truth of the [Deed,6] and require Aid of the Justices; but if they of their own head will say, that it is (7) Disseisin, their Verdict shall be admitted at their own Peril. And from henceforth the Justices shall not put in Assises or Juries any other than those that were sum.moned to the same at the first.

that alledged the Exception do write the same Excep.tion, and require that the Justices will put to their Seals for a Witness, the Justices shall so do; and if one will not, another of [the Company'] shall. And if the King, upon Complaint [made of the Justices,1] cause the Re.cord to come before him, and the same Exception be not found m the Roll, and the Plaintiff shew the Ex.ception written, with the Seal of a Justice put to, the Justice shall be commanded that he appear at a certain Day, either to confess or deny his Seal; and if the Jus.tice cannot deny his Seal, they shall proceed to Judge.ment according to the same Exception, as it ought to be allowed or disallowed.

WHEN Religious Men and other Ecclesiastical Per.sons do implead any, and the Party impleaded maketh Default, whereby he ought to leese the Land, foras.much as the Justices have thought hitherto that if the Party impleaded make Default by Collusion, that where the Demandant, by Occasion of the Statute, could not obtain Seisin of the Land by Title of Gift, or other Alienation, [he shall now Õ] by reason of the Default, and so the Statute is defrauded; It is Ordained by our Lord the King, and granted, That in this Case, after the Default made, it shall be inquired by the Country, whether the Demandant had Right in the Thing demanded, or no. And if it be found that the Demandant had Right in his Demand, the Judgement shall pass with him, and he shall recover Seisin: and if he hath no Right, the Land shall accrue to the next Lord of the Fee, if he demand it within a Year from the Time of the Inquest taken; and if he do not demand it within the Year, it shall accrue to the next Lord above, if he do demand it within half a Year after the same Year; and so every Lord after the next Lord shall have the Space of half a Year to demand it successively, until it come to the King, to whom at length, through Default of other Lords, the Lands shall accrue: And to challenge the Jurors of the Inquest, every of the Chief Lords of the Fees shall be admitted, and likewise for the King, they that will shall challenge; and after the Judgement given, the Land shall remain [clear4] in the KingÕs Hands, until it be dereigned by the Demandant, or some other Chief Lord, and the Sheriff shall be charged to answer therefore at the Exchequer.

FORASMUCH as many Tenants set up Crosses, or [cause4] to be set up in their Lands, in Prejudice of their Lords, that Tenants should defend themselves against the Chief Lords of the Fee, by the Privileges of Templars and Hospitalers; It is Ordained, That such Lands shall be forfeit to the Chief Lords, or to the King, in the same manner as is provided (6) for Lands aliened in Mortmain.

IT is Provided, That if a Man from henceforth do ravish a Woman, married, Maid, or other, where she did not consent, neither before nor after, he shall have Judgement of Life and of Member. And likewise where a Man ravisheth a Woman, married Lady, Damosel, or other, with Force, although she consent after, he shall have such Judgement as before is said, if he be at.tainted at the KingÕs Suit, and there the King shall have the Suit.

And of Women carried away with the Goods of their Husbands, the King shall have the Suit for the Goods so taken away. And if a Wife willingly leave her Hus.band, and go away, and continue with her Advouterer, she shall be barred for ever of Adion to demand her Dower, that she ought to have of her HusbandÕs Lands, if she be convid thereupon, except that her Husband willingly, and without Coertion of the Church, recon.cile her, and suffer her to dwell with him; in which Case she shall be restored to her Adion. He that car- rieth a Nun from her House, although she corÇent, shall be punished by three Years Imprisonment, and shall make convenient Satisfadion to the House from whence she was taken, and nevertheless shall make Fine at the KingÕs Will.

CONCERNING Children Males or Females, whose Marriage belongeth to another, taken and carried away, if the Ravisher have no Right in the Marriage, though after he restore the Child unmarried, or else pay for the Marriage, he shall nevertheless be punished for his Of.fence by two Years Imprisonment. And if he do not restore, or do marry the [Child'] after the Years of Consent, and be not able to satisfy for the Marriage, he shall abjure the Realm, or have perpetual Imprisonment; and thereupon the Plaintiff shall have such a Writ: [Si A. fecerit te securum de clamore suo, &c. tunc pone per vadium, &c. B. quod sit coram Justiciariis, &c. ostensurus, quare talem haeredem infra aetatem existen- tem, cujus maritagium ad ipsutn pertinet, tali loco in- ventum rapuit & abduxit contra voluntatem ipsius A. & contra pacem nostram, &c.'] And if the Heir be in the same County, then this Clause must be thereto added: [Et diligenter inquiras, ubi ille haeres sit in balliva tua; & ipsum (ubicunque fuerit inventus) capias, & salvo & secure custodias, ita quod eum habeas coram praefatis Justiciariis nostris ad praefatum terminum, ad reddendum cui praediftorum A. vel B. reddi debeat:3] and Suit shall be made against the Party on whom Complaint is made, until he come in by Distress, if he have whereby he may be distrained; or else for his Contumacy, in case he be not [justifiable,4] he shall be (!) outlawed ; and if percase the Heir be [married or carried6] into another County, then a Writ shall be dire&ed to the Sheriff of the same Shire in this Form: [Questus est nobis A. quod B. nuper talem haeredem infra aetatem & in custodia sua existentem tali loco in comitatu tali rapuit, & de comitatu tali ad talem locum in ComÕ tuo abduxit contra voluntatem ipsius

A. & contra pacem nostram, &c. Et ideo tibi prae- cipimus, quod praedi&um haeredem (ubicunque in bal.liva tua invenire poteris) capias, & salvo & secure eum custodias, ita quod eum habeas coram Justitiariis nos.tris, &c. tali die, quern idem A. habet versus prae- didtum B. ad reddendum cui de jure reddi debeat.7] And if the Heir do die afore he can be found, or be.fore he can be restored to the Plaintiff, the Plea shall pass between them nevertheless, until it be tried unto whom he ought to have been restored if he had been living ; neither shall the Ravisher of such a one be excused or eased of the Punishment aforesaid by the Death of the Heir, whom he did withhold by wrong during his Life. And if the Plaintiff die before the Plea determined, if the Right belong to him by reason of his proper Fee, the Plea shall be resummoned at the Suit of the Heir of the Plaintiff, and the Plea shall pass in due Order; but if the Right belongeth to him by another Title, as by a Title of Gift, Sale, or other sucn like, then the Plea shall be resummoned at the Suit of the Executors of the Plaintiff, and the Plea shall pass as before is said. In the same manner if the Defendant die before the Plea be tried, or the Heir be restored, the Plea shall pass by Resummons between the Plaintiff, his Heirs or Executors, and the Executors of the Defendant, or his Heirs, if the Executors be not sufficient, to satisfy for the Value of the Marriage, after as it is contained in other Statutes, but not as to the Pain of Imprison.ment, [for8] none ought to be punished for the Offence of another. In the same manner when a Plea hangeth between Parties for the Ward of Land, or of an Heir, or of both, by the common Writ that beginneth Praecipe

And if any be attached upon such false Complaints, he shall replevy his Distress so taken, and shall cause the Matter to be brought afore the Justices, before whom if the Sheriff, [Bailiff, or other Lord,*] after that the Party distrained hath framed his Plaint, will advow the Distress lawful by reason of such Complaints made unto them, and it be replied that such Plaints were moved maliciously against the Party by the Solicitation or Pro.curement of the Sheriff, or other Bailiffs, or Lords, the same Replication shall be admitted ; and if they be con- vift hereupon, they shall make Fine to the King, and ne.vertheless restore treble Damages to the Parties grieved.

FORASMUCH also as Bailiffs, to whose Office it belongeth to take Distresses, intending to grieve [their Inferiors,5] that they may exaft Money of them, do send Strangers to take Distresses, to the Intent that they might grieve [their Inferiors,5] by reason that the Parties so distrained, not knowing such Persons, will not suffer the Distresses to be taken ; It is Provided, That no Dis.tress shall be taken, but by Bailiffs sworn and known. And if they which do distrain do otherwise, and thereof be convift, if the Parties grieved will purchase a Writ of Trespass, they shall restore Damages to the Parties grieved, and besides, shall be grievously punished to.wards the King.

able to travel: Neither shall this Statute extend to great Assises, in which it behoveth many times Knights to pass not resident in the Country, for the Scarcity of Knights, so that they have Land in the Shire. And if the Sheriff, or his [ Undersheriffs,'] or Bailiffs of Li.berties, offend in any Point of this Statute, and there.upon be convift, Damages shall be awarded to the Parties grieved, and they shall nevertheless be amerced to the King; and Justices assigned to take Assises, when they come into the Shire, shall have Power to hear the Plaints of all Complainants as to the Articles contained in this Statute, and to minister Justice in Form aforesaid.

FORASMUCH as Justices, to whose Office it be- longeth to minister Justice to all that sue before them, are many Times disturbed in due Execution of their Office, for that Sheriffs do not return Writs original and judicial; and also for that they make false Returns unto the KingÕs Writs ; Our Lord the King hath pro.vided and ordained, That such as do fear the Malice of Sheriffs, shall deliver their Writs original and judicial in [the open County, or in the County1] where the Collection of the KingÕs Money is ; and may take of the Sheriff or Undersheriff, being present, a Bill, wherein the Names of the Demandants and Tenants mentioned in the Writ shall be contained ; and at the Request of him that delivered the Writ, the Seal of the Sheriff or Undersheriff shall be put to the Bill for a Testimony, and Mention shall be made of the day of the Deliverance of the Writ. And if the Sheriff or Undersheriff will not put his Seal to the Bill, the Witness of Knights and other credible Persons being in presence shall be taken, that put their Seals to such Bill. And if the Sheriff will not return Writs delivered unto him, and Complaint thereof be made to the Justices, a Writ judicial shall go unto the Justices assigned to take Assises, that they shall inquire by such as were present at the Deliverance of the Writ to the Sheriff, if they knew of the Deliver.ance, and an Inquest shall be returned. And if it be found by the Inquest, that the Writ was delivered to him, Damages shall be awarded to the Plaintiff' or De.mandant ; having respeft to the Quality and Quantity of the Action, and to the Peril that might have come to him by reason of the Delay that he sustained ; and by this mean there shall be Remedy when the Sheriff retumeth that the Writ came too late, whereby he could not execute the KingÕs Commandment.

Oftentimes also Pleas be delayed by reason that the Sheriff returneth that he hath commanded the Bailiffs of some Liberty which did nothing therein, and nameth Li.berties that never had the Return of Writs ; whereupon our Lord the King hath ordained, That the Treasurer [and Barons] of the Exchequer shall deliver [to the Jus.tices] in a Roll all the Liberties in all Shires that have Return of Writs. And if the Sheriff answer that he hath made Return to a Bailiff of another Liberty than is contained in the said Roll, the Sheriff shall be forthwith punished as a Disheritor of our Lord the King and his Crown. And if peradventure he return that he hath de.livered the Writ to a Bailiff of some Liberty that indeed hath Return, the Sheriff shall be commanded, that he shall not spare for the foresaid Liberty, but shall execute the KingÕs Precept; and that he do the Bailiffs to wit to whom he returned the Writ, that they be ready at a Day contained in the Writ, to answer why they did not exe.cute the KingÕs Precept; And if they come at the Day, and acquit themselves, that no Return was made to them, the Sheriff shall be forthwith condemned to the Lord of the same Liberty, and likewise to the Party grieved by the Delay, for to render Damages. And if the Bailiffs come not in at the Day, or do come, and do not acquit themselves in manner aforesaid, in every judicial Writ, so long as the Plea hangeth, the Sheriff shall be commanded that he shall not spare for the Liberty, See. Many times also Sheriffs make false Re.turns as touching [these Articles,5] Quod de exitibus,&c. returning sometime, and lying, that there be no Issues, sometime that there are small Issues, when they may re.turn great, and sometime do make mention of no Issues;

Wherefore it is ordained and agreed, That if the Plain- tiff demand hearing of the SheriffÕs Return, it shall be granted him ; and if he offer to aver that the Sheriff might have returned greater Issues [unto the King,] he shall have a Writ judicial unto the Justices assigned to take Assises, that they shall inquire in Presence of the Sheriff if he will be there of what and how great Issues the Sheriff might have made Return from the Day of the Writ [purchased '] unto the Day contained in the Writ. And when the Inquest is returned, if he have not afore answered for the Whole, he shall be charged with the Overplus by the Extreats [of the Justices] delivered in the Exchequer, and nevertheless shall be grievously amerced for the Concealment. And let the Sheriff know that Rents, Com in the Grange, and all moveables, ex.cept Horse Harness, (*) and Houshold Stuff, be con.tained within the Name of Issues. And the King hath commanded, that Sheriffs shall be punished by the Jus.tices once or twice, if need be, for such false Returns ; and if they offend the third Time, none shall have to do therewith but the King. They make also many times false Answers, returning that they could not execute the KingÕs Precept for the Resistance of some great Man ; [wherefore3] let the Sheriffs beware from hence.forth, for such Manner of Answers redound much to the Dishonour of the King; and as soon as his [Bailiffs4] do testify that they found such Resistance, forthwith all Things set apart, taking with him the Power of the Shire, he shall go in proper Person to do Execution ; and if he find his Underbailiffs false, he shall punish them by Imprisonment, so that other by their Example may be reformed ; and if he do find them true, he shall punish the Resisters by Imprisonment, from whence they shall not be delivered without the KingÕs special Commandment. And if percase the Sheriff" when he cometh do find Resistance, he shall certifie to the Court the Names of the Resisters, Aiders, Consenters, Com.manders, and Favourers, and by a Writ judicial they shall be attached by their Bodies to appear at the [KingÕs] Court; and if they be convict of such Resistance, they shall be punished at the KingÕs Pleasure. Neither shall any Officer of the KingÕs meddle in assigning the Pu.nishment, for our Lord the King hath reserved it spe.cially to himself, because that [Resisters have been5] reputed Disturbers of his Peace, and of his Realm.

WHERE any doth aliene the Right of his Wife, It is agreed, That from henceforth the Suit of the Woman, or her Heir, after the Death of her Husband, shall not be delayed by the Nonage of the Heir that ought to warrantise, but let the Purchaser tarry, which ought not to have been ignorant that he bought the Right of another, until the Age of his Warrantor, to have his Warranty.

OUR Lord the King hath ordained, That if Abbots, Priors, Keepers of Hospitals, and other Religious Houses founded by him or by his Progenitors, do from hence.forth aliene the Lands given to their Houses by him or by his Progenitors; the Land shall be taken into the KingÕs Hands, and holden at his Will, and the Pur.chaser shall lose his Recovery as well of the Lands, as of the Money that he paid. And if the House were founded by an Earl, Baron, or other Persons, for the Lands so aliened, he [from6] whom, or [from6] whose Ancestor, the Land so aliened was given, shall have a Writ to recover the same I.and in Demesne, which is thus: [Praecipe tali Abbati, quod juste, &c. reddat G.F. tale tenementum quod eidem domui collatum fu;t in liberam eleemosynam per predictum G. vel antecessores suos, & quod ad prediftum G. reverti debet per alienationem quam praediftus Abbas fecit de praedidto tenemento, contra formam collationis praedida:, ut dicit.7] In like manner for Lands given for the Main-

Of Abbots and Priors holding an whole Barony, when they do Homage or Fealty for their Baronies, he shall take one Palfray, or the Price, as afore is said; and this shall also be observed [amongst'] Archbishops and Bishops. Of such as hold but a Part of a Barony, whether they be Religious or Secular, he shall take according to the portion of the part of the Barony that they hold. Of Religious Men that hold in free Alms and not by a Barony, nor Part of a Barony, the Marshal from henceforth shall demand nothing: And our Lord the King hath granted, that by this Statute [a5] Marshal of Fee shall not be barred hereafter to demand more, if he can shew that he hath Right unto more. The KingÕs Chamberlains from henceforth shall have of Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, and other Persons Spiritual, of Earls and Barons holding an entire Barony, a reasonable Fine when they do their Homage or Fealty (6); and if j they hold by a Part of a Barony, they shall take a rea.sonable Fine according to the Portion to them belong.ing. Other Abbots, Priors, and other Persons Spiritual and Temporal, that hold no entire Barony, nor Part of a Barony, shall not be distrained to make Fine, as it is said by them that hold by a Barony, or Part of a Barony, but the Chamberlain shall be contented with [his7] upper Garment, or with the Price thereof; which is done in favour of Persons Religious more than of Lay Persons; for it is more convenient that Religious Men should fine for their Upper Garment, than to be stripped.

BE it Prohibited from henceforth to Hospitallers and Templars, that hereafter they bring no Man in Plea before the Keepers of their Privileges for any Matter, the Knowledge whereof belongeth to the KingÕs Court; which if they do, first, they shall yield Damages to the Party grieved, and be grievously punished unto the King. The King also prohibiteth to the Keepers of such Privileges, that from henceforth they grant no Citations at the instance of Hospitallers, Templars, or other Per.sons privileged, before it be expressed upon what Matter the Citation ought to be made; and if the Keepers do see that Citation is required upon any Mat.ter, the Knowledge whereof belongeth to the KingÕs

Court, the Keepers shall neither make nor knowledge the Cttation. And if the Keepers do otherwise, they s all yield Damages to the Party grieved, and neverthe.less shall be grievously punished by the King. And forasmuch as such Persons privileged, depute Keepers, oub-Pnors, Chantors, Sextons, which be Religious Men, and which have nothing to satisfy the Parties grieved, nor the King; which be more bold to offend the KingÕs Dignity than their Superiors, to whom Punishment may be assigned by their Temporalties: Let the Prelates of such Obedients therefore beware from henceforth, that they do not suffer their Obedients to usurp any Juris.diction in Prejudice of the King and his Crown ; and if they do, their Superiors shall be charged for their FaCt, as much as if they had been convict upon their proper Aft.

CONCERNING Porters [bearing Verge before Justices of the Bench in the Circuit Õ] ; It is Provided,

That of every Assise and Jury that they keep they shall take [xd.!] only, and for the [BillsÕ] nothing. Of such as recover their Demands by Default, Confession, or otherwise by Judgement without Assise and Jury,

[they shall take nothing;] of such as go without Day by Default of the Demandant or Plaintiff, they shall take nothing. And if any recover his Demand against many by one Writ, and by Recognizance of Assise or Jury, they shall be content with iv d. And likewise if many named in one Writ do recover by Recognizance of Assise or Jury, they shall be content with ivd. Of such as do Homage in the Bench, they shall be content with their upper Garment. Of great Assises, Attaints, Juries, and Battle waged, they shall take xii d. only. Of such as be called before Justices to sue or to defend their Pleas, they shall take nothing for their coming in or forth. At the Pleas of the Crown, for every Dozen xii d. only shall be taken. Of every Prisoner deli.vered iv d. shall be taken. Of every one whose Peace is proclaimed xii d. only shall be taken. [Of the Find.ers of Men slain, and others of a Town attached, iv d. OfTythingmen nothing shall be taken.*] Of Cyro- graphers, for making a Cyrografe, it is ordained, that they shall be contented with iv s. Of Clerks writing Writs original and judicial, it is ordained, That for one Writ they shall take but id. And the King chargeth all his Justices, upon their Faith and Oath that they owe him, that if such Manner of Officers offend in any Ar.ticle against this Statute, and Complaint come to them thereof, they shall execute on them reasonable Punish.ment : And if they offend the second Time, they shall award greater Punishment, that they may be duly cor.rected : And if they offend the third Time, and be thereupon convifted, if they be Officers [of the Fee,Õ] they shall leese their Fee; and if they be other, they shall void the KingÕs Court, and shall not be received again, without the special Grace [and Licence6] of the King himself.

BECAUSE that of such Things as be recorded before* XLV. the Chancellor and the Justices of the King that have Record, and be inrolled in their Rolls, Process of Plea ought not to be made by Summons, Attachments,

Essoin, View of Land, and other Solemnities of the Court, as hath been used to be done of Bargains and Covenants made out of the Court; From henceforth it is to be observed, That those Things which are found inrolled before them that have Record, or contained in Fines, whether they be Contrafts, Covenants, Obliga.tions, Services, or Customs knowledged, or other Things whatsoever inrolled, wherein the KingÕs Court, without Offence of the Law and Custom, may execute their Authority, from henceforth they shall have such Vigour, that hereafter it shall not need to plead [for7] them;

But when the Plaintiff cometh to the King's Court, if the Recognisance or Fine levied be fresh, that i.- to say, levied within the Year, he shall forthwith h ve a Writ of Execution of the same Recognisance made.

And if the Recognisance were made, or the Fine levied of a further Time passed, the Sheriff shall be commanded,

that he give Knowledge to the Party of whom it is com.plained, that he be [afore the Justices] at a certain Day, to shew if he have any thing to say why such Matters inrolled or contained in the Fine ought not to have Execution. And if he do not come at the Day, or peradventure do come, and can say nothing why Execu.tion ought not to be done, the Sheriff shall be com.manded to cause the Thing inrolled or contained in the Fine to be executed. In like Manner, an Ordinary shall be commanded in his Case, observing nevertheless as before is said of a Mean, which by Recognisance or Judgement is bound to acquit.

WHEREAS in a Statute made at Merton, it was granted that Lords of Wastes, Woods, and Pastures, might approve the said Wastes, Woods, and Pastures, notwithstanding the Contradiction of their Tenants, so that the Tenants had sufficient Pasture to their Tene.ments with free [Egress and Regress to'] the same: And Forasmuch as no Mention was made between [Neighbours and Neighbours,Õ] many Lords of Wastes, Woods, and Pastures, have been hindered heretofore by the Contradi&ion of Neighbours having sufficient Pasture: And because foreign Tenants have no more Right to Common in the Wastes, Woods, or Pastures of any Lord than the LordÕs own Tenants; It is Or.dained, That the Statute of Merton, provided between the Lord and his Tenants, from henceforth shall hold Place between Lords of Wastes, Woods, and Pastures, and their Neighbours; Saving sufficient Pasture to their Tenants and Neighbours, so that the Lords of such Wastes, Woods, and Pastures, may make Approvement of the Residue. And this shall be observed for such as claim Pasture as appurtenant to their Tenements. But if any do claim Common (3) by special Feoffment or Grant for a certain Number of Bieasts, or otherwise [whichJ] he ought to have of common Right, [whereas Covenant barreth the I.aw,J] he shall have such Reco.very as he ought to have had by Form of the Grant made unto him ; By occasion of a Windmill, Sheepcote Deyry, inlarging of a Court necessary, or Courtelage, from henceforth no Man shall be grieved by Assise of Novel Disseisin for Common of Pasture. And where sometime it chanceth, that one having Right to approve, [doth then levy6] a Dyke or an Hedge, and some by Night, or [at another Season, when they suppose not to be espied,7] do overthrow the Hedge or Dyke, and it cannot be known by Verdift of the Assise or Jury, who did overthrow the Hedge or Dyke, and Men of [the Towns near š] will not indidt such as be guilty of the Fad, [the Towns near adjoyning9] shall be distrained to levy ('Ò) the Hedge or Dyke at their own Cost, and to yield Damages. And where one, having no Right to Common, usurpeth Common what Time an Heir is within Age, or a Woman is covert, or whilst the Pas.ture is in the Hands of Tenants in Dower, by the Cour.tesy, or otherwise for Term of Life or Years, or in Fee- tail, and have long Time used the Pasture, many hold opinion, that such Pastures ought to be said to belong to [the"] Freehold, and that the Possessor ought to have Aftion by a Writ of Novel Disseisin, if he be deforced of such Pasture; but from henceforth this must be holden, that such as have entred within the lime that an Assise of Mortdauncestor [hath lien,"] if they had no Common before, shall have no Recovery by a Writ of Novel Disseisin, if they be deforced.

IT is Provided, That the Waters of Humber, Owse, Trent, Done, Arre, Derewent, Wherfe, Nid, Yore, Swale, Tese, [Tine, Eden,] and all other Waters wherein Salmons be taken (,J), shall be in Defence for taking Salmons from the Nativity of our Lady unto St. MartinÕs Day; and that likewise young Salmons shall not be taken nor destroyed by Nets, nor by other Engines at Millpools, from the midst of April unto the Nativity of St. John Baptist.

And for the third Trespass, they shall be imprisoned a whole Year; and as their Trespass increaseth, so shall the Punishment.

FOR View of Land It is Ordained and Provided, That from henceforth View shall not be granted but in case when View of Land is necessary ; As if one lose Land by Default, and he that loseth, [moveth a Writ'] to demand the same Land; and in case when one by an Exception dilatory abateth a Writ after the View of the Land, as by Non-tenure, or misnaming of the Town, or such like, if he purchase another Writ, in this Case, and in the Case before mentioned, from henceforth the View shall not be granted, if he had View in the first Writs. In a Writ of Dower, where the Dower in De.mand is of Land that the Husband aliened to the Tenant or his Ancestors, where the Tenant ought not to be ignorant what Land the Husband did aliene to him or his Ancestor, though the Husband died not seised, yet from henceforth View shall not be granted to the Tenant. In a Writ of Entre also, that is abated because the Demandant misnamed the Entre, if the Demandant purchase another Writ of Entre, if the Tenant had View in the first Writ, he shall not have it in the second. In all Writs also where Lands be demanded by reason of a Lease made by the Demandant, or his Ancestor, unto the Tenant, and not to his Ancestor, as that which he leased to him, being within Age, not whole of Mind, being in Prison, and such like, View shall not be granted hereafter; but if the Demise were made to his Ancestor, the View shall lie as it hath done before.

THE Chancellor, Treasurer, Justices, nor any of the KingÕs Council, no Clerk of the Chancery, nor of the Exchequer, nor of any Justice or other Officer, nor any of the KingÕs House, Clerk ne Lay, shall not receive any Church, nor Advowson of a Church, Land, nor Tenement in Fee, by Gift, nor by Purchase, nor to Farm, nor by Champerty, nor otherwise, so long as the Thing is in Plea before Us, or before any of our Officers ; nor shall take no Reward thereof. And he that doth [contrary to this Aft,3] either himself, or by another, or make any [Bargain,4] shall be punished at the KingÕs Pleasure, as well he that purchaseth, as he that doth sell.

ALL the said Statutes shall take Effeft at the Feast of St. Michael next coming, so that by occasion of any Offence done on this Side the said Feast, contrary to any of these Statutes, no Punishment, Mention whereof is made within these Statutes, shall be executed upon the Offenders. Moreover, concerning the Statutes provided where the Law faileth, and for Remedies, lest Suitors coming to the KingÕs Court should depart from thence without Remedy, they shall have Writs provided in their Cases, but they shall not be pleaded until the Feast of St. Michael aforesaid.

The STATUTE of WINCHESTER.

FORASMUCH as from Day to Day, Robberies, Murthers, [Burnings, and Theft,'] be more often used than they have been heretofore, and Felons cannot be attainted by the Oath of Jurors, which had rather suffer [Strangers to be robbed, and so pass without pain,1] than to indite the Offenders, of whom great part be People of the same Country, or at the least, if the Offenders be of another Country, the Receivers be of places near; and they do the same, because [an Oath is not given unto Jurors of the same Country where such Felonies were done, and to the Restitution of Damages,3] hitherto no Pain hath been limited for their concealment and Laches; Our Lord the King, for to abate the power of Felons, hath established a Pain in this case, so that from henceforth, for fear of the Pain more than for fear of any Oath, they shall not spare any, nor conceal any Felonies; And doth command, That [Cries4] shall be solemnly made in all Counties, Hundreds, Markets, Fairs, and all other Places where great Resort of People is, so that none shall excuse himself by Ignorance, that from henceforth every Country be so well kept, that immediately upon such Robberies and Felonies com.mitted, fresh Suit shall be made from Town to Town, and from Country to Country.

LIKEWISE, when need requires, Inquests shall be made in Towns, by him that is Lord of the Town, and after in the Hundred, and in the Franchise, and in the County, and sometimes in two, three, or four Counties, in case when Felonies shall be committed in the Marches of Shires, so that the Offenders may be attainted. And if the Country will not answer [for the Bodies of such manner of Offenders,3] the Pain shall be such, that every Country, that is to wit, the People dwelling in the Country, shall be answerable for the Robberies done, and also the Damages; so that the whole Hundred where the Robbery shall be done, with the Franchises being within the Precintt of the same Hundred, shall be an.swerable for the Robberies done. And if the Robbery be done in the Division of Two Hundreds, both the Hundreds [and the Franchises within them6] shall be answerable; and after that the Felony or Robbery is done, theCountry shall have no longer Space than [Forty Days,7] within which [forty days'] it shall behove them to agree for the Robbery or Offence, or else that they will answer for the Bodies of the Offenders.

AND Forasmuch as the King will not that his People should be suddenly impoverished by reason of this Penalty, that seemeth very hard to many; the King granteth, That [they shall not incur9] immediately, but n shall be respited until Easter next following, within which Time the King may see how the Country will order themselves, and whether such Felonies and Rob.beries do cease. After which Term let them all be assured, that the foresaid Penalty shall run generally, that is to say, every Country, that is to wit, the People in the Country, shall be answerable for Felonies and Robberies done among them.

AND for the more Surety of the Country, the King hath commanded, that in great Towns, being walled, the Gates shall be closed from the Sun-setting until the Sun-rising; and that no man do lodge in Suburbs, nor [in any place out of the Town, from nine of the Clock until Day,1] without his Host will answer for him ; and the Bailiffs of Towns every Week, or at the least every Fifteenth Day, shall make Inquiry of all Persons being lodged in the Suburbs, or [in foreign Places'] of the Towns ; and if they do find any [that have lodged or received any Strangers or suspicious person, against the peace,7] the Bailiffs shall do right therein. And the King commandeth, that from henceforth [all Towns be kept,4] as it hath been used in times passed, that is to wit, from the Day of the Ascension unto the Day of St. Michael, in every City [Six Men shall keep7] at every gate, in every Borough (*) Twelve Men, (7) every Town (') Six or Four, according to the Number of the Inhabitants of the Town, and (9) shall watch the Town continually all Night, from the Sun-setting unto the Sun-rising. And if any Stranger do pass by them, he shall be arrested until Morning ; and if ho Suspicion be found, he shall go quit; and if they find cause of Sus.picion, they shall forthwith deliver him to the Sheriff, and the Sheriff may receive him without Damage, and shall keep him safely, until he be [acquitted '¡] in due Manner. And if they will not obey the Arrest, they shall levy Hue and Cry upon them, and [such as keep the Town shall follow with Hue and Cry with all the Town, and the Towns near, and so Hue and Cry shall be made from Town to Town,"] until that they be taken and delivered to the Sheriff, as before is said; and for the Arrestments of such Strangers none shall be punished.

AND Further, It is commanded, That Highways lead.ing from one Market Town to another shall be enlarged, whereas [Bushes Woods "] or Dykes be, so that there be neither Dyke [Tree,J] nor Bush, whereby a Man may lurk to do hurt, (,4) within two hundred foot of the one side, and two hundred foot on the other side of the way, so that this Statute shall not extend unto [Ashes,17] nor unto great Trees, [for which it shall be clearly out of this.'6] And if by Default of the Lord that will not abate the Dyke, Underwood or Bushes, in the manner aforesaid, any Robberies be done therein, the Lord shall be answerable for the Felony; and if Murther be done the Lord shall make a Fine at the KingÕs Pleasure. And if the Lord be not able to fell the Underwoods, the Country shall aid him therein. And the King willeth, that in his demean Lands and Woods within his Forest and without, the Ways shall be en.larged, as before is said. And if percase a Park be [taken from '7] the Highway, it is requisite that the Lord shall [set,8] his Park [the space of two hundred foot from the Highways,'9] as before is said, or that he make such a Wall, Dyke, or Hedge, that Offenders may not pass, ne return to do evil.

AND Further, It is commanded, That every Man have in his house Harness for to keep the Peace after the antient Assise; that is to say, Every Man between fifteen years of age, and sixty years, shall be assessed and sworn to Armor according to the quantity of their Lands and Goods ; that is to wit, [from Ò] Fifteen Pounds Lands, and Goods (*') Forty Marks, an Hauberke, [a Breast.plate "] of Iron, a Sword, a Knife, and an Horse; and [from *Ò] Ten Pounds of Lands, and Twenty Marks Goods, an Hauberke, [a Breast-plate of Iron,"] a Sword, and a Knife ; and [from10] Five Pound Lands,

Forasmuch as Merchants after complained unto the King, that Sheriffs misinterpreted his Statutes, and sometimes by Malice and false Interpretation delayed the execution of the Statute, to the great damage of Merchants ; the King at his Parliament holden at Westminster after Easter, the Thirteenth Year of his Reign, caused the said Statute made at Afton Bumel to be rehearsed ; and for the Declaration of certain articles in the Statute afore.said, hath ordained and established, That a Merchant who will be sure of his Debt, shall cause his Debtor to coine before the Mayor of London, or before some chief Warden of a City or of another good Town, where the King shall appoint; and before the Mayor and chief Warden, or other sufficient [Men 'J chosen and sworn thereto, when the Mayor or chief Warden cannot at.tend, and before one of the Clerks, that the King shall thereto assign, when both cannot attend, he shall knowledge the Debt and the Day of Payment; and the Recognisance shall be inrolled by one of the Clerks hands being known, and the Roll shall be double, whereof one part shall remain with the Mayor or chief Warden, and the other with the [Clerks Õ] that thereto shall be first named ; and further, one of the said Clerks with his own hand shall write an Obligation, to which writing the Seal of the Debtor shall be put with the KingÕs Seal, provided for the same Intent; which Seal shall be of two Pieces, whereof the greater Piece shall remain in the custody of the Mayor, or the chief Warden, and the other Piece in the keeping of the fore- said Clerk. And if the Debtor do not pay at the Day limited unto him, then shall the Merchant come to the Mayor and Clerk with his Obligation ; and if it be found by the Roll or Writing, that the Debt was knowledged, and the Day of Payment expired, the Mayor or chief Warden shall cause the Body of the Debtor to be taken, if he be Lay, whensoever he happeneth to come in their power, and shall commit him to the Prison of the Town, if there be any, and he shall remain there at his own Casts, until he hath agreed for the Debt. And It is commanded that the Keeper of the Town Prison shall retain him upon the delivery of the Mayor or Warden; and if the Keeper (J) [shall not4] receive him, he shall be answerable for the Debt, if he have whereof; and if he have not whereof, he that committed the Prison to his keeping shall answer. And if the Debtor cannot be found in the power of the Mayor or chief Warden, then shall the Mayor or chief Warden send into the Chan.cery, under the KingÕs Seal, the Recognisance of the Debt; and the Chancellor shall direct a Writ unto the Sheriff in whose Shire the Debtor shall be found, for to take his Body, if he be Lay, and safely to keep him in Prison until he hath agreed for the Debt; and within a Quarter of a Year after that he is taken, his Chattels (3) shall be delivered him, so that by his own he may levy and pay the Debt; and it shall be lawful unto him, during the same Quarter, to sell his Lands and Tene.ments for the discharge of his Debts, and his Sale shall be good and effeftual. And if he do not agree within the Quarter, [next>] after the Quarter expired, all the Lands and Goods of the Debtor shall be delivered unto the Merchant by a reasonable Extent, to hold them until such Time as the Debt is wholly levied j and neverthe.less the Body shall remain in Prison as before is said; and the Merchant shall find him Bread and Water; and the Merchant shall have such Seisin in the Lands and Tenements delivered unto him, or his Assignee, that he may maintain a Writ of Novel Disseisin, if he be put out, and Re-disseisin also, as of Freehold, to hold to him and his Assigns until the Debt be paid; and as soon as the Debt is levied (?) the Body of the Debtor shall be delivered with his Lands. And in such Writs as the Chancellor doth award Mention shall be made, that the Sheriff shall certify the Justices of the one Bench or of the other, how he hath performed the KingÕs Command.ment, at a certain day ; at which day the Merchant shall sue before the Justices, if Agreement be not made; and if the [Sheriffs"] do not return the Writ, or do return that the Writ came too late, or that he hath directed it

And when the Lands of the Debtors be deli.vered unto the Merchant, he shall have Seisin of all the Lands that were in the hand of the Debtor, the day of the Recognizance made, in whose hands soever that they come after, either by Feoffment or otherwise. And after the Debt paid, [the DebtorÕs Lands and the issues of Lands of Debtors by feoffment shall return again, as well to the Feoffee, as the other Lands unto the Debtors.5] And if the Debtor or his Sureties die, the Merchant shall have no Authority to take the Body of his Heir, but he shall have his Lands, as before is said, if he be of age, or when he shall be of full age ; [until he hath levied of the Lands the amountance and value of the Debt.] And a Seal shall be provided, that shall serve for Fairs, and the same shall be sent unto every Fair under the KingÕs Seal by a Clerk sworn, or by the Keeper of the Fair [, And of' the Commonalty of the Merchants of the City of London Two Merchants shall be chosen, that shall swear6] and the Seal shall be opened before them; and the one Piece shall be de.livered unto the foresaid Merchants, and the other shall remain with the Clerk; and before them, or one of the Merchants, if both cannot attend, the Recognizances shall be taken, as before is said. And before that any Recognizance be inrolled, the pain of the Statute shall be openly read before the Debtor, so that after he can.not say, that any did put another Penalty than that whereto he bound himself. And to maintain the Costs of the said Clerk, the King shall take of every Pound a Penny, in every Town where the Seal is, except Fairs, where he shall take one penny halfpenny of the Pound.

X Yourselves circumspectly in all matters concerning the Bishop of Norwich and his Clergy, not punishing them if they bold Plea, in Court Christian, of such things as be meer spiritual, that is to wit, of Penance enjoined by Prelates for deadly Sin, as Fornication* Adultery, and such like, for the which sometimes cor.poral Penance, and sometime pecuniary is enjoyned* specially if a Freeman be convift of such things.

Also if Prelates do punish for leaving the Church.yard unclosed, or for that the Church is uncovered, or not conveniently decked, in which cases none other Penance can be enjoined but pecuniary.

Item, if a Parson demand of his Parishioners Obla.tions or Tithes due and accustomed ; or if any Parson do sue against another Parson for Tithes greater or smaller, so that the fourth part of the value of the Be.nefice be not demanded.

Item, if a Parson demand Mortuaries, in Places where a Mortuary hath been used to be given.

Item, if a Prelate of a Church or, [of a Patron,Õj demand of a Parson a Pension due to him, all such Demands are to be made in a Spiritual Court.

And for laying violent hands on a Clerk, and in cause of Defamation, it hath been granted already, that it shall be tried in a Spiritual Court, when money is not demanded, but [a thing done*] for Punishment of Sin, and likewise for breaking an Oath.

In all cases afore rehearsed, the Spiritual Judge shall have power to take knowledge, notwithstanding the KingÕs Prohibition (').

[Under what Form shall Lay-men *] purchase Pro.hibitions generally upon Tithes, Oblations, Obventions, redeeming of Penances, Mortuaries, violent Hands lay.ing on a Clerk or Lay-Brother, and in Cases of Defa.mation, in which Cases Spiritual Penance must be en.joined ? The King answered to these Articles ; That in Tithes, Oblations, Obventions, and Mortuaries when [they be pleaded *] as before is said, the KingÕs Prohibition doth not lie. And if a Clerk or a Person Religious do sell his [Corn6] being in his Bam, or otherwhere to any Man for Money, if the Price thereof be demanded before a Spiritual Judge, the King s Prohibition doth lie; for by the Sale the Spiritual are become Temporal, and so [Tithes pass into7] Chatties.

STATUTES for the

THESE be the Articles which Our Lord the King doth command to be well kept in his City of London, for the keeping and maintenance of his Peace.

First, Whereas many Evils, as Murders, Robberies, and Manslaughters have been committed heretofore in the City by Night and by Day, and People have been beaten and evil intreated, and divers other Mischances have befallen against his Peace ; It is enjoined that none be so hardy to be found going or wandering about the Streets of the City, after Cur.few tolled at St. Martins le Grand, with Sword or Buckler, or other Arms for doing Mischief, or whereof evil suspicion might arise ; nor any in any other Manner, unless he be a great Man or other lawful Person of good repute, or their certain Messenger, having their Warrants to go from one to another, with Lanthern in hand. And if any be found going about contrary to the Form aforesaid, unless he have cause to come late into the City, he shall be taken by the Keepers of the Peace and be put into the place of confinement ap.pointed for such Offenders; and on the morrow he shall be brought and presented before the Warden, or the Mayor of the City for the Time being, and before the Aldermen ; and according as they shall find that he hath offended, and as the Custom is, he shall be punished.

And Whereas such Offenders as aforesaid going about by Night, do commonly resort and have their Meetings and hold their evil talk in Taverns more than elsewhere, and there do seek for shelter, lying in wait, and watching their time to do Mischief ; It is enjoined that none do keep a Tavern open for Wine or Ale, after the tolling of the aforesaid Curfew ; but they shall keep their Tavern shut after that hour, and none therein drinking or resorting; Neither shall any Man admit others in his House except in common Taverns, for whom he will not be answerable unto the KingÕs Peace. And if any Taverner be found doing the contrary, the first time he shall be put in pledge by his Tavern drinking cup, or by other good pledge there found, and he amerced forty- pence { and if he be found a second time offending, he shall be ameTced half a mark ; and the third time Ten Shillings; and the fourth time he shall pay the whole Penalty double, that il to say, Twenty Shillings: And the fifth time be shall be forejudged of his Trade for ever.

Also, Forasmuch as Fools who delight in Mischief, do leam to fence with Buckler, and thereby are the more encouraged to commit their Follies ; It is Provided and enjoined that none shall hold school for, nor shall teach the Art of Fencing with Buckler, within the City, by Night or by Day ; and if any S3 do, he shall be imprisoned for Forty Days.

And Whereas Malrfattors taken and arrested for Tres.passes, as for Batteries, spilling of Blood, and other Offences against the Peace of our Lord the King, and for evil suspi.cion, are often delivered too easily, by reason whereof, others the less dreading such Punishments are encouraged in their Follies, and in often transgressing against the Peace, in ex.pedition of such easy Deliverance: It is Provided that no Man so imprisoned shall be delivered by tbe Sheriff, nor by any Officer under him, without the Award of the War.den or Mayor for the Time being, and of the Aldermen ; unless the Trespass be very small; and then good and solemn Mainprize shall be taken, and of Persons justiceable before the Bailiffs of the City, that he do appear before the said Warden or Mayor, and the Aldermen, at a certain Day, to receive Award and Judgement according to his Trespass.

Moreover It is Provided, that every Alderman in his Wardmote shall make diligent Enquiry concerning such Ma- lefa£tors, resorting to and abiding in his Ward ; and if any such be found by Presentment or Indi&ment of the good Men of the Ward, or by evil suspicion, they shall straight be attached by their Bodies, and brought before the Warden or Mayor, and the Aldermen, and be arraigned of that whereof they are indi&ed or presented ; and they who can.not acquit themselves, shall be punished by Imprisonment, or other Punishment, at their Discretion, and according to what the Trespass requircth.

And Whereas divers Persons do resort unto the City, some from Parts beyond the Sea, and others of this Land, and do there seek shelter and refuge, by reason of Banishment out of their own Country, or who for great offence or other mis.deed have fled from their own Country ; and of these some do become Brokers, Hostelers, and Innkeepers within the City, for Denizens and Strangers, as freely as though they were good and lawful Men of the Franchise of the City; and some nothing do but run up and down through the Streets, mote by Night than by Day, and are well attired in Cloathing and Array, and have their Food of delicate Meats and costly; Neither do they use any Craft or Merchandize, nor have they Lands or Tenements whereof to live, nor any Friend to find them: and through such Persons many perils do often happen in the City, and many evils, and some of them are found openly offending, as in Robberies, breaking of Houses by night, Murders, and other evil Deeds: It is Pro.vided that no Man of Foreign Lands or other Person what.soever, shall be a resiant Innkeeper or Hosteler in the City, unless he be a Freeman of the City, admitted and at Farm before the Warden or Mayor, and the Aldermen, as a good Man and true ; and that he have good testimony from the Parts whence he cometh, that he hath well and lawfully de.parted ; and that he find safe Pledges justiceable before the Bailiffs of the City, to be answerable to the KingÕs Peace, and to save the Citizens and the City harmless. And there shall be no Broker in the City, except those who are admitted and sworn before the Warden or Mayor, and Aldermen. And all that are Innkeepers, Hostelers, and Brokers in the City, con.trary to the form aforesaid, from one Month after the Day when these Articles shall be read and published in the City, shall forego the same, and withdraw themselves that thty do so no more; and if any be found offending herein after the said Month, or any other of whom there is evil suspicion for his ill behaviour, as for bad Company, or by good Evidence of the Neighbourhood, he shall forthwith be arrested by his

THE KING, who willeth that the Peace of his City be well kept among all Persons, having been informed that his said Articles are not observed, neither can be, by reason that his Officers have been many times accused and grievously punished before his Auditors of Plaints, and elsewhere in his Court, for imprisoning and otherwise punishing Offenders and suspetled Persons, for that they had not the KingÕs Warrant for so doing ; whereby the said Officers have been and are less bold to chastise and punish Offenders, and these do be.come so much the more daring to offend, and do give unto others the example of evil doing, to the great peril of the City and great encouragement of Offences; He doth will and command, that from henceforth none of his Officers shall be complained of before his Auditors of Plaints, or else.where in his Court, for any imprisoning or other punishing of Offenders or Persons suspected of evil : Unless it be that any Officer should so do of open malice and for his own re.venge, or for the revenge of another that maliciously procureth the same, and not for the keeping of the Peace.

And the King willeth that these Provisions, and the Additions, be well and surely kept in the aforesaid City, for the maintenance of his Peace, with the Amendments thereof when it shall please him to make such, for the Profit of his City.

And if it be a Charter of Confirmation of the Gift of Te.nements, or of a Tenement given by the King or by another, then thus: We have Inspe&ed, 8cc. as before. And at the End thus: We therefore, the aforesaid Gift and Grant ratuy- ing and approving, the same for Us and our Heirs, to such an one and his Heirs, or to such an one and his Succes.sors, do grant and confirm; as the aforesaid Charters do justly and reasonably testify. These being Witnesses, 8cc. or, In Witness, &c.

And if in the Charter to be confirmed both be contained, that is to say, a Grant of Liberties, and a Gift of Lands, by our Predecessor or Predecessors or others, then in this Form, Edward, Sec. Ws have Inspe&ed the Charter which such an one, our Predecessor or Ancestor made to such an one, of such a Tenement, or of such Tenements, and of the Liberties under.written, in these Words: And then at the End of such Confir.mation, mention shall be made of both, thus: We therefore, the aforesaid Gifts and Grants ratifying and approving, the same for Us and our Heirs, to such an one and his Heirs, or to such an one and his Successors, do grant and confirm ; as the aforesaid Charter, or the aforesaid Charters, of such an one our Predecessor or Ancestor, of such a Tenement, or of such Tenements, and as the Charter or Charters of him or of them, of the aforesaid Liberties, which he and his Predecessors or Ancestors have hitherto reasonably used, do justly and reasonably testify.

And if the Charter or Charters of another or others, of a new Gift and a new Grant of a Tenement, or of Tenements, be required to be confirmed, then thus: Edward, 8cc. We have Inspected the Charter of such an one, or of such Per.sons, 8tc. in these words; We therefore, the aforesaid Gifts and Grants ratifying and approving, the same for Us and our Heirs do grant and confirm; Saving Our Right and the Right of any other Person ; as the aforesaid Charter or Charters do reasonably testify. These being Witnesses, &c. or, In Witness, 8cc.

And if it happen that after such Confirmations, there arise a Doubt whether any Article or Articles in the Charter con.tained, might have been fully exercised or not; then when it is come to lhat Doubt, a Discussion shall be had before the Trea.surer and Barons of the Exchequer, concerning the using of the Article or Articles, whereupon the Doubt shall have arisen ; and for the making of that Discussion, the Treasurer and Ba.rons shall associate unto them the Justices of each Bench, and all other Justices who shall then happen to be in London. Yet so that if the Justices of the King's Bench should be absent, and peradventure any Justice of the other Bench should be absent, or any one of the aforesaid Barons, that Discussion shall not therefore be deferred to be made; but the Treasurer and the rest of the Barons, taking unto them the Justices then there present, shall proceed to make that Discussion : and it shall be determined by them, what ought in future to be observed as to that Article or Articles, by the Use or Abuse thereof.

And if any Man require the Deed or Gift of another to be confirmed by our Lord the King, it is first to be seen whether the Donation or Grant, or Deed or Gift be new, or an old one confirmed by the King: And if it be new, the Confir.mation shall be deferred, until it shall appear unto our T ord the King, that he hath no Right in the Tenement granted by another.

A STATUTE of our Lord The King, concerning the Selling and Buying of Land.

FORASMUCH as Purchasers of Lands and Tene.ments of the Fees of great men and [other Lords,1] have many times' heretofore entered into their Fees, to the prejudice of the Lords, [to whom *] the Freeholders of such great men (!) have sold their Lands and Tene.ments to be holden in Fee (4) of their Feoffors, and not of the Chief Lords of the Fees, whereby the same Chief Lords have many times lost their Escheats, Marriages, and Wardships of Lands and Tenements belonging to their Fees; which thing seemed very hard and extream unto those [Lords and other great men,5] and more.over in this case manifest Disheritance: Our Lord the King, in his Parliament at Westminster after Easter, the eighteenth year of his Reign, that is to wit, in the Quinzime of Saint John Baptist, at the instance of the great Men of the Realm, granted, provided, and or.dained, That from henceforth it shall be lawful to every Freeman to sell at his own pleasure his Lands and Te.nements, or part of them ; so that the Feoffee shall hold the same Lands or Tenements of the [Chief Lord of the same Fee, by such Service6] and Customs as his Feoffor held before.

AND if he sell any part of such Lands or Tenements to any, the Feoffee shall immediately hold it of the Chief Lord, and shall be forthwith charged with the Services, for so much as pertaineth, or ought to pertain to the said Chief Lord for the same parcel, according to the Quantity of the Land or Tenement [so] sold: And so in this case the same part of the Service [shall remain to the Lord, to be taken by the hands of the Feoffee, for the which he ought7] to be attendant and answerable to the same Chief Lord, according to the Quantity of the Land or Tenement sold, for the parcel of the Service so due.

AND it is to be understood, that by the said Sales or Purchases of Lands or Tenements, or any parcels of them, such Lands or Tenements shall in no wise come into Mortmain, either in part or in whole, neither by Po.licy ne Craft, contrary to the Form of the Statute made thereupon of late. And It is to wit, that this Statute extendeth but only to Lands [holden8] in Fee Simple; and that it extendeth to the time coming; and it shall begin to take effeft at the Feast of Saint Andrew the Apostle next coming.

The Statute oe Quo Warranto.

FORASMUCH as Writs of Quo Warranto, and also Judgements given upon Pleas of the same, were greatly delayed, because the Justices in giving Judgement [were not1 ] certified of the KingÕs Pleasure therein ; Our Lord the King, at his Parliament holden at Westminster, after the Feast of Easter, the eighteenth Year of his Reign, of his special Grace, and for the Affeftion that he beareth unto his Prelates, Earls, and Barons, and other of his Realm, hath granted, That all under his Allegiance, whatsoever they be, as well Spi.ritual as other, which can verify by good Enquest of the Country, or otherwise, that they and their Ancestors or Predecessors have used any manner of Liberties, whereof they were impleaded by the said Writs, before the time of King Richard our Cousin, or in all his time, and have continued hitherto (*) so that they have not misused such Liberties, that the Parties shall be ad.journed further unto a certain day reasonable before the same Justices, within the which they may go to our Lord the King with the Record of the Justices, signed with their Seal, and also return; and our Lord the King, by his Letters [Patents] shall confirm their Estate. And they that cannot prove the Seisin of their Ancestors or Predecessors in such manner as is before declared, shall be ordered and judged after the Law and Custom of the Realm; and such as have the KingÕs Charter shall be judged according to their Charters (3). Moreover, the King of his special Grace hath granted, that all Judgements that [are to be *] given in Pleas of Quo Warranto, by his Justices at West.minster, after the foresaid Easter, for our Lord the King himself, if the Parties grieved will come again before the King, he of his grace shall give them such remedy as before is mentioned. Also our said Lord the King hath granted, for sparing of the Costs and Expences of the People of his Realm, that Pleas of Quo Warranto from henceforth shall be pleaded and determined in the Circuit of the Justices; and that all Pleas (5) now depending (Ò) shall be adjourned into their own Shires, until the coming of the Justices into those Parts: (7)

1 have not hitherto been ¥ * 'without Interruption, and

! and the full effeS of the tame 4 have been

1 and that in the meanwhile after Adjournment to made they shall

remain without day.

Another New Statute of Quo Warranto.

CONCERNING the Writ that is called Quo War.ranto, our Lord the King, at the Feast of Pentecost, in the eighteenth year of his Reign, hath established, that all those which claim to have quiet possession of any Franchise before the time of King Richard, without Interruption, and can shew the same by a lawful En.quest, shall well enjoy their possession ; and in case that such Possession be demanded for cause reasonable, our Lord the King shall confirm it by Title. And those that have old Charters of Franchise, shall have the same Charters adjudged according to the tenor and form of them. And those that have lost their Liberties sith Easter last passed, by the foresaid Writ, according to the course of pleading in the same Writ heretofore used, shall have restitution of their Franchise lost, and from henceforth they shall [have1] according to the nature of this present Constitution.

How Writ* of Quo Wa:rjnto ought to bÛ determined and pleaded in future.

Liberties by

Prescription.

Liberties by Charter, icc.

Pleas of Quo Warranto shall be determined in the Circuit.

Liberties by Prescription or the King's Grant.

Ecclesiastical Judges may proceed; not.withstanding the KingÕs Prohibition; if there be no Remedy at Law.

Slot. IVestml. chap. 40.

The Statute of the Writ of Consultation.'

WHEREAS Ecclesiastical Judges have often sur.ceased to proceed in Causes moved before them, by force of the KingÕs Writ of Prohibition, in Cases whereas Remedy could not be given to Complainants in the KingÕs Court, by any Writ out of the Chancery, [because thatÕ] such Plaintiffs were deferred of their right and remedy in both Courts, as well [Temporal3] as Spiritual, to their great damage, like as the King hath been advertised by the grievous Complaint of his Sub- jedts: Our Lord the King willeth and commandeth, that where Ecclesiastical Judges do surcease in the aforesaid Cases, by the KingÕs Prohibition directed unto them, that the Chancellor, or the Chief Justice of our Lord the King for the time being, upon sight of the Libel of the same matter, at the instance of the Plaintiff, if they can see that the Case cannot be redressed by any Writ out of the Chancery, but that the Spiritual Court ought to determine the Matters, shall write to the Ecclesiastical Judges, before whom the Cause was first moved, that they proceed therein, notwithstanding the KingÕs Prohibition direfted to them before.

WHEREAS the Tenant impleaded in a Plea of Land heretofore had vouched (') to Warranty, and thereupon the Demandant would aver, that neither he that is vouched, nor any of his Ancestors, since the time that the Ancestor of the Demandant was seised, was in possession of the said Lands, neither in Demean nor in Service, if the Party vouched were present, and would warantise the Land freely unto the Tenant, such Averment of the Demandant hath not been used to be admitted, unless the party vouched had been absent, and that by reason of a certain Statute of the KingÕs [lately] made amongst other Statutes of West. 1; Wherefore our Lord the King, considering the Fraud, Deceit, and Malice, and also his own Damage, and Disherison of his Crown, that in the said case [hath many times happened in this Court, and daily doth, whereas '] some holding of the King in chief by a whole Barony, in a Plea hanging before the Justices of the Bench, [upon their demand do vouch3] particularly, [base persons'] unknown and Strangers [which they will bring forth,3] and of whom neither they nor their Ancestors had ever any thing in the Lands that they warranted, nor in any other Lands or Tenements within this Realm, neither in Demean nor in Service, as hath been testified by divers of the KingÕs faithful Sub.jects ; so that by such Cautel, Fraud, and Malice, the same Tenants holding by an entire barony, [do6] de.fraud the King of the Amerciament that they should incur, if the Demandant should recover against them :

A Statute or Waste.

WILLIAM BUTLER, which is within Age, and in Ward of our Lord the King, hath shewed unto his Highness, that where Gawin Butler his Bro.ther whose Heir he is, had (') impleaded one Walter de Hapeton by the KingÕs Writ, for Waste and Destruc.tion made by him the said Walter in certain his Lands and Tenements, which the same Walter held for Term of his Life, of the Inheritance of the aforesaid Gawin in Wimme and Thirke; and the foresaid Gawin, before he had obtained Judgement, died; after whose death the foresaid William by like Writ impleaded the loresaid Walter for the Waste and Destru&ion made by him of long time; the same Walter, before Gilbert Thornton and his companions assigned to hear the KingÕs Pleas, came in, and said, that he ought not to answer to the same William for the Waste and Destruftion made in the rime of another, before the Right of the said Inheritance descended unto him, and thereupon de.manded Judgement: And Forasmuch as certain Justices did not agree in giving of the said Judgement, because it seemed to some that it should not be agreeable to the Law, that any Person should obtain advantage and recompense by the foresaid Writ, which is a Writ of Trespass done to a Person certain, but only the same Person to whom and in whose time the Trespass was done; other Justices, with the more part of the KingÕs Council, were in the contrary opinion, alledging by divers reasons, that the said William ought to be heard and answered unto, and all other whatsoever they be, in like cases, [or in like Trespasses j And because like matters have remained not amended, and Trespasses unpunished, which was inconvenientÕ]: Wherefore our Lord the King (>) in his full Parliament holden the day after the Feast of the Purification, in the Twentieth year of his Reign, [by a general Council4] hath ordained, and from henceforth hath commanded to be straitly observed, That every Heir, in whose Ward soever he be, and as well within Age as of lull Age, shall have his Recovery by a Writ of Waste in the foresaid case, and also in other where the same Writ

And It is commanded by the King himself unto the same Gilbert Thornton and his Companions, that they do proceed in the foresaid matter, and in otherlike from henceforth; and Judgement shall be given according as the matter is found.

The Statute of defending Right.

WHERE One by the KingÕs Writ doth demand any Tenements against Tenant by the Courtesie, in Tail, in Dower, or (') for Term of Life, or of Years, and the Demandant sueth so far that the Lands be in manner [recovered,1] whereupon another, [not Party to the Suit cometh in3] before Judgement given, and saith, That he hath Fee and Right in those Lands, and prayeth the Court, that in as much as he is come before Judgement, ready to defend his Tenement, and to make answer unto the Demandant, that he may be admitted thereunto by force of a Statute made by the King that now is, amongst other the last Statutes made at West.minster; by which Statute as well such as had no Right, as they which had Right, oftentimes in the case before mentioned, falsely, and in Deceit of the Court did come in, and pray to be received to make Answer, that by their Admission they might prolong the Demandant from the Judgement and Seisin of his Land, and to cause those Demandants to plead of new ; and so the Demand.ants are [greatly4 *] deferred in the case aforesaid to recover their Right in the KingÕs Court, by reason of such Malice, [as well by mistaking of the said Statute, as J] for any other cause just and reasonable ; and this is used and found often before our Justices : Wherefore our Lord the King, for to withstand all such Malice in the aforesaid case, and intending to provide a Remedy therein, in his full Parliament, and by his Common Council, hath ordained, and from henceforth commanded straitly to be observed, that is to wit, from the Monday next after the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, the Twentieth year of his Reign, that when any before Judgement in the foresaid case cometh in by a collateral Title, and desireth to be received, before his Receipt he shall find sufficient Surety, as the Court will award, to satisfie the Demandant of the value of the Lands so to be recovered, from the day that he is received to make answer until the time that final Judgement be given upon the Petition of [the Demandant. And if6] the Demandant recover his Demand, [the Defendor7] shall be grievously amerced, if he have whereof; and if he have not, he shall be imprisoned at the KingÕs Pleasure. And if he can prove his Right to be as good as he affirmed at such time as he was received, he shall go quit.

Concerning

assigned.

Slat. Westm.t. igE.I.c. 30.

Four Circuits appointed for the taking of Assises, See. throughout the year.

UREAS Our Lord the King did of late in his last Statutes of Westminster dire£f, that in every County certain Justices and no others should be assigned, to take the Assises, Juries, and Certificates in those Counties, at certain seasons : And because as well the Justices of either Bench, as the Justices in Eyre, when they were not upon the Circuit, who had been assigned to do the said office within limited times, being often hindered as well by reason of their office, as by the commands of our Lord the King to them dire&ed, could not come at the Days and Places which they had ap.pointed } by reason whereof through their absence many were put off from their Right, and Trespasses remained un.punished : Our Lord the King being willing as far as

he is able, that every one of his Silbje&s should have speedy Justice upon wrong done unto him, doth command, that

From henceforth there shall be assigned eight cir.cumspect and discreet Justices, to take Assises, Juries, and Certificates through the whole Realm, that is to say ; Two in the Counties of York, Northumberland, Westmorland, Cumberland, Lancaster, Nottingham, and Derby. And Two in the Counties of Lincoln, Lei.cester, Warwick, Stafford, Salop, Northampton, Rut.land, Gloucester, Hereford, and Wigom. And Two in the Counties of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Wilts, Southampton, Oxoii, Berks, Sussex, and Surrey. And Two in the Counties of Kent, Essex, [Suffolk, Norfolk,'] Cambridge, Huntingdon, Bedford, and Buck.ingham. And the Assises, Juries, and Inquests of the County of Middlesex shall be taken before the Justices of the Bench. Which said eight Justices assigned to take the Assises [and Certificates aforesaid,1] shall espe.cially attend and [daily3] through the whole year, that is to say (4) in the places where they think best and most for the ease of the People: And the Term of the Statute last made at Westminster, of taking of Assises, in no wise shall be observed. Nor no Writs of As.sises, Juries, or Recognisances shall be granted to be taken before any other Justices than before the aforesaid Justices assigned, except it be of the special Grace of the King, &c.

The GREAT CHARTER of the LIBERTIES of ENGLAND, And of the LIBERTIES of the FOREST:

Confirmed by King Edward, in the Twenty-fifth Year of his Reign.

EDWARD by the Grace of God King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Guyan, [to all Archbishops, Bishops, See.'} We have seen the Great Charter of the Lord Henry sometimes King of England, our Father, of the Liberties of England in these words: Henry by the Grace of God King of England,Lord of Ireland, Duke of Normandy and Guyan, and Earl of Anjou, to all Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, Sheriffs, Provosts, Officers, and to all Bailiffs, and other our faithful Subjedls, which shall see this present Charter, Greeting: Know Ye, that We, unto the honour of Almighty God, and for the salvation of (*) the souls of our Progenitors and Successors [Kings of England,] to the advancement of Holy Church and amendment of our Realm, of our meer and free will, have given and granted to all Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and to all [Freemen] of this our Realm, these Liberties following, to be kept in our Kingdom of England for ever.

FIRST, We have granted to God, and by this our present Charter have confirmed, for Us and our Heirs for ever, that the Church of England shall be free, and shall have all her whole Rights and Liberties inviolable. We have granted also, and given to all the Freemen of our Realm, for Us and our Heirs for ever, these Li.berties under-written, to have and to hold to them and their Heirs, of Us and our Heirs for ever.

IF any of our Earls or Barons, or any other, which hold of Us in chief by Knight's Service, die, and at the time of his death his Heir be of full age, and oweth [to us] Relief, he shall have his inheritance by the old Relief; that is to say, the Heir or Heirs of an Earl for a whole Earldom, by one hundred pound ; the Heir or Heirs of a Baron, for an whole Barony, by one hundred marks ; the Heir or Heirs of a Knight, for one whole KnightÕs Fee (J) one hundred shillings at the most; and he that hath less shall give less, according to the old Custom of the Fees.

BUT if the Heir of any such be within Age, his Lord shall not have the Ward of him, nor of his Land, before that he hath taken of him Homage; and after that such an Heir hath been in Ward, when he is come to full Age, that is to say, to the Age of one and twenty years, he shall have his Inheritance without Relief and without Fine: So that if such an Heir, being within Age, be made Knight, yet nevertheless his Land shall remain in the keeping of his Lord unto the term aforesaid.

THE Keeper of the Land of such an Heir, being within Age, shall not take of the Lands of the Heir, but reasonable Issues, reasonable Customs, and reasonable Services, and that without Destruction and Waste of his men and his goods. And if We commit the cus.tody of any such Land to the Sheriff, or to any other

And the View of Frankpledge shall be likewise at the Feast of Saint Michael, without [occasion :'] So that every man may have his Liberties which he had or used to have in the time of King Henry our Grandfather, or which he hath purchased since. The View of Frankpledge shall be so done, that our Peace may be kept; and that [the Tything be wholly kept,1] as it hath been accustomed; and that the Sheriff [seek no occasions ;s] and that he be content with so much as the Sheriff was wont to have for his View-making, in the time of King Henry our Grandfather.

IT shall not be lawful from henceforth to any to give his Lands to any Religious House, [and *] to take the same Land again, to hold of the same House: Nor shall it be lawful to any House of Religion (J) to take the Lands of any, [and to lease the same*] to him of whom [he received it.7] If any from henceforth (s) give his Lands to any Religious House, and thereupon be con- vi£f, the Gift shall be utterly void, and the Land shall accrue to the Lord of the Fee.

EDWARD by the Grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Guyan, To All to whom these Presents shall come, sendeth Greeting: We have seen the Charter of the Lord Henry our Father, sometime King of England, concerning the Forest in thesewords. Henry, by the Grace of God, King of Eng.land, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Normandy and Guyan, [and Earl of Anjou, to all Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, Justicers, Foresters, Sheriffs, Provosts, Officers, and to all his Bailiffs, and faithful Subje&s which shall see this present Charter, Greeting. Know Ye, that We, unto the honour of Almighty God, and for the salvation of our soul and the souls of our Ancestors and Successors, to the advance.ment of Holy Church, and amendment of our Realm, of our mere and free will have given and granted, to all Archbishops, Bishops, Earls, Barons, and to all of this our Realm, these Liber ties, following, to be kept in our Kingdom of England for ever.']

FIRST, We will that all Forests, which King Henry our Grandfather afforested, shall be viewed by good and lawful men; and if he have made Forest of any other Wood more than of his own Demesne, whereby the Owner of the Wood hath hurt, forthwith it shall be disafforested; and if he have made Forest of his own Wood, then it shall remain Forest, saving the Common of Herbage, and of other things in the same Forest, to them which before were accustomed to have the same.

MEN that dwell out of the Forest, from henceforth shall not come before the Justicers of our Forest by common Summons, unless they be impleaded there, or be Sureties for some others that were attached for the Forest.

ALL Woods which have been made Forest by King Richard our Uncle, or by King John our Father, until our first Coronation, shall be forthwith disafforested unless it be our demesne Wood.

ALL Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, Knights, and other our Freeholders which have their Woods in Forests, shall have their Woods as they had them at the (Õ) first Coronation of King Henry our Grandfather. So that they shall be quit for ever of all Purprestures, Wastes, and Asserts, made in those Woods after that time, until the beginning of the se.cond year of our Coronation. And those that from henceforth do make Purpresture without our Licence, or Waste or Assert in the same, shall answer unto Us for the same Wastes, Purprestures, and Asserts.

OUR Rangers shall go through the Forest to make Range, as it hath been accustomed at the Time of the first Coronation of King Henry our Grandfather, and not otherwise.

THE Enquiry or View for Lawing of Dogs within our Forest shall be made from henceforth when the Range is made, that is to say, from three year to three year ; and then it shall be done by the view and testi.mony of lawful men, and not otherwise ; and he whose Dog is not lawed, and so found, shall pay for his amercia.ment iij. s.: And from henceforth no Ox shall be taken for I.awing of Dogs. And such Lawing shall be done by the Assise commonly used, that is to say, that three claws of the fore foot shall be cut off [by the skin.3] But from henceforth such Lawing of Dogs shall not [be,4] but in places where it hath been accustomed from the time of the first Coronation of the foresaid King Henry our Grandfather.

NO Forester or Bedel from henceforth shall make Scotal, or gather garb, or oats, or any com, lamb, or pig, nor shall make any [Gathering, but3] by the sight and upon the [view6] of the twelve Rangers, when they shall make their [Range. So7] many Foresters shall be assigned to the keeping of the Forests, as reasonably shall seem sufficient for the keeping of the same.

F'DWARD, by the Grace of God, King of England, t.

j Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Guyan, To All those that these present Letters shall hear or see, Greeting, ciurten. Know Ye that We, to the honour of God, and of Holy Church, and to the Profit of our Realm, have granted for us and our Heirs, that the Charter of Liberties, and the Charter of the Forest, which were made by Common Assent of all the Realm, in the time of King Henry our Father, shall be kept in every point with.out breach. And We will that the same Charters shall be sent under our Seal, as well to our Justices of 1 ereo Õ the Forest, as to others, and to all Sheriffs of Shires, and to all our other Officers, and to all our Cities through.out the Realm, together with our Writs, in the which it shall be contained, that they cause the foresaid Char.ters to be published, and to declare to the People that We have confirmed them in all points; and [that Õ] our Justices, Sheriffs, Mayors, and other Ministers, which under Us (*) have the Laws of our Land to guide, [shall allow the said Charters pleaded before them in Judgment in all their points;J] that is to wit, the Great Charter as the Common Law, and the Char.ter of the Forest (4) for the Wealth of our Realm.

AND We will, that if any Judgement be given from II. henceforth contrary to the points of the Charters afore- said by the Justices, or by any other our Ministers that e

hold Plea before them against the points of the Charters, TOid. it shall be undone and holden for nought.

AND We will, that the same Charters shall be sent, under our Seal, to Cathedral Churches throughout our Realm, there to remain, and shall be read before the People two times by the year.

AND that all Archbishops and Bishops shall pronounce the Sentence of (J) Excommunication against all those that by [Word,] Deed, (6) or Counsel do contrary to the foresaid Charters, or that in any point break or undo them. And that the said Curses be twice a year de.nounced and published by the Prelates aforesaid. And if the same Prelates, (7) or any of them be remiss in the Denunciation of the said Sentences, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York for the time being (') shall compel and distrein them [to the execution of their dutiesÕ] in form aforesaid.

IV.

The Breaker*

of the

Charter* *hall be excom.municated.

AND for so much as divers People of our Realm are v. in fear, that the Aids and Tasks which they have given Aids, Tut*, to Us beforetime towards our wars and other business, and Pn**'s of their own grant and good will, howsoever they were to

made, might turn to a Bondage to them and their Heirs, ,;,*]) not be because they might be at another time found in the taken for a Rolls, and [likewise for,0] the Prises taken throughout t'u,tora- the Realm by our Ministers ("); We have granted for Us and our Heirs, that We shall not draw such Aids,

Tasks, nor Prises into a Custom, for any thing that hath been done heretofore, [be it by Roll or any other Precedent that may be founden."]

MOREOVER we have granted for Us and our Heirs as well to Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, and other Folk of Holy Church, as also to Earls, Barons, and to all the Communalty of the Land, that for no business from henceforth we shall take (Õ3) such manner of Aids, Tasks, nor Prises, but by the common assent of the Realm, and for the common profit thereof, saving the ancient Aids and Prises due and accustomed.

AND for so much as the more part of the Commu- nalty of the Realm find themselves sore grieved with the [Maletent'] of Woolls, that is to wit, a Toll of Forty Shillings for every Sack of Wooll, and have made pe.tition to Us to release the same; We at their requests have clearly released it, and have granted [for Us and our Heirs] that we shall not take [such things *] without their common assent and good will; Saving to Us and our Heirs the Custom of Woolls, Skins, and Leather, granted before by the Communalty aforesaid.

UDWARD, by the Grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland and Duke of Guyan, to the Sheriff of Lancaster greeting. Whereas of late before our Passage into Flanders, We, being at Westminster, having regard unto the heavy charges and expences, which the People of our Realm had made and sustained in divers manners in our behalf, as well in time of Peace as War, had no small wish and desire to shew favour unto the same People, as far as We were able at that time ¥, and did grant unto the same People, of our own free will, for Us and our Heirs, That the Great Charter of Liberties should be observed in all its points; and likewise that the Charter of the Forest should be kept \ yet saving our Oath, the Right of our Crown, and our Exceptions, and those of others also : Which things We did then cause to be declared on our part and in our presence, by the Reverend Father Robert Archbishop of Canterbury ; and again at Odimere, in our way into Flanders, We gave command under our Seal, that the same Grant should be observed and holdcn throughout

our whole Realm, in every County. And Because from that time forth, We have been manifoldly occupied and distra&ed by restraint and distress of Wars, in divers Countries and afar off, by reason whereof We could not know the state of our Realm ; We in these days so far as our leisure allows, perse.vering in our former intention, have deliberated upon our aforesaid Grant: And to the Honour of God and of our Holy Mother Church, and the good of the whole People of our Realm, We will that the aforesaid Great Charter of Liberties be observed in all its points; and the Charter of the Forest also, according to the under-written Articles, which are these.

The Enquiry or View for Lawing of Dogs within our Forest shall be made from henceforth when the Range is made, that is to say, from three year to three year ; and then it shall be done by the view and testimony of lawful men, and not otherwise; and he whose Dog is not lawed, and so found, shall pay for his Amercia.ment iij s.: And from hencefoith no Ox shall be taken for Lawing of Dogs. And such Lawing shall be done by the Assise commonly used, that is to say, that three claws of the fore foot shall be cut off [by the skin.1] But from henceforth such Lawing of Dogs shall not [be,1] but in places where it hath been accustomed from the time of the first Coronation of the foresaid King Henry our Grandfather. No Forester or Bedel from henceforth shall make Scotal, or gather garb, or oats, or any com, lamb, or pig, nor shall make any [Gathering, butJ] by the sight and upon the [view4] of the twelve Rangers, when they shall make their [range. So7] many Foresters shall be assigned to the keeping of the Forests, as reasonably shall seem sufficient for the keeping of the same. No Swanimote from henceforth shall be kept within this our Realm, but thrice in the year; videlicet, the beginning of fifteen days afore Mi.chaelmas, when that our Gest-takers, or Walkers of our Woods, come together to take Agestment in our demesne Woods; and about the Feast of St. Martin [in the winter,] when that our Gest-takers shall receive our pawnage: And to these two Swanimotes shall come together our Foresters, Vierders, Gest-takers, and none other, by distress; and the third Swanimote shall be kept in the beginning of fifteen days before the feast of St. John Baptist, [when that our Gest-takers do meet to hunt our deer ;6] and at this Swanimote shall meet our Foresters, Vierders, and none other, by distress. More.over, every forty Days through the year our Foresters and Vierders shall meet to see the Attachments of the Forest, as well for greenhue, as for hunting, by the Pre.sentment of the same Foresters, and before them at.tached. And the said Swanimotes shall not be kept but within the Counties in which they have used to be kept. Every Freeman may agest his own Wood within our Forest at his pleasure, and shall take his Pawnage. Also We do grant, that every Freeman may drive his Swine freely without impediment through our demesne Woods, for to agest them in their own Woods, or else where they will. And if the Swine of any Freeman lie one night within our Forest, there shall be no occasion taken thereof, whereby he may lose any thing of his own. No Man from henceforth shall lose either Life or Mem.ber for [killing7] of our Deer; but if any man be taken and convict for taking of our Venison, he shall make a grievous fine, if he have any thing whereof; and if he have nothing to lose, he shall be imprisoned a year and a day: and after the year and day ex.pired, if he can find sufficient Sureties, he shall be deli.vered; and if not, he shall abjure the Realm of England. Whatsoever Archbishop, Bishop, Earl, or Baron, com.ing to us at our commandment, [passing bv *] our Forest, it shall be lawful for him to take and kill one or two of our Deer, by view of our Forester, if he be present; or else he shall cause one to blow an horn for him, that he seem not to steal our Deer.

And likewise they shall do returning from us, as it is aforesaid. Every Freeman from henceforth without danger,' ] shall make in his own wood, or in his land, Õor in his water,1] which he hath within our Forest, [mills, springs, pools, marl-pits, dikes,3 ] or earable ground, [without inclosing that earable ground,4] so that it be not to the annoyance of any of his neighbours. Every Freeman shall have, within his own Woods, Ayries of Hawks, Sparrow-hawks, Faulcons, Eagles, and Herons: and shall have also the Honey that is found within his Woods. No Forester from hence.forth, which is not Forester in fee, paying to Us ferm for his Bailiwick, shall take any Chimmage or Toll within his Bailiwick; but a Forester in fee, paying us ferm for his Bailiwick, shall take Chimmage; that is to say, for carriage by Cart the half-year ij d. and for an.other half-year ij d. for an horse that beareth loads, every half-year, an half-peny, and by another half year half a peny ; and but of those only that come as Mer.chants [through his Bailiwick5] by licence to buy bushes, timber, bark, coal, and (6) to sell it again at their Pleasure; but for none other carriage by Cart (7) Chimmage shall be taken ; nor Chimmage shall not be taken, but in such places only where it (*) hath been used to be (9). Those which bear upon their backs brushment, bark, or coal to sell, though it be their living, shall ('¡) pay no Chimmage [to our Fo.resters, except they take it within our demesne Woods.] All that be outlawed for the Forest only, since the time of King Henry our Grandfather, until our first Coro.nation, shall come to our peace without let: and shall find to us Suredes, that from henceforth they shall not trespass unto us within our Forest. No Constable, Castellan, or [Bailiff"] shall hold Plea of Forest, neither for greenhue nor hunting; but every Forester in Fee shall make Attachments for Pleas of Forest, as well for greenhue as hunting, and shall present them to the Vierders of the Provinces ; and when they be enrolled and enclosed under the seals of the Vierders, they shall be presented to our chief [Justicers "] of our Forest, when [they "] shall come into those parts to hold the Pleas of the Forest, and before [them'1] they shall be determined.Ó Which Articles abovesaid, We will to be stedfastly ob.served andholden: Willing nevertheless that Perambulation be made ; Saving always our Oath, the Right of our Crown, and our Exceptions and Challenges, and those of all other Persons : So that such Perambulation be reported unto Us, before that any execution or any thing else be done thereupon : Which Perambulation We will shall be made as aforesaid, as soon as may be after the businesses that we have in hand with the Messengers who are about to come from the Court of Rome; but which are indeed so arduous, that they not only concern Us and our Realm, but all Christendom ; and for the more sound consideration whereof We shall fully require the advice of our whole Council. And besides the making of our Crant of the premises, as it is expressed above. We have upon diligent meditation thought of certain Defeils in the Law, manifold Grievances and Oppressions, which in many other ways have been brought upon the People aforesaid in times past: And We are willing, upon those which occur to Us at present, towards the Relief and Benefit of the same People, for the certainty of the Law, to establish and set a Remedy in manner following.

FORASMUCH as Fines levied in our Court ought and do make an end of all matters, and therefore are called Fines [principally, where after waging of Batail,J] or the great Assise in their cases ever they hold the last and final place : And now by a certain time passed, as well in the time of King Henry of famous memory, our Grandfather, as in our time, the Parties of such Fines and their Heirs, contrary to the Laws (Ò) of our Realm of ancient time used, were admitted to adnul and

defeat such [Fine,1] alledging, that before the Fine levied, and at the levying thereof, and since, the De.mandants or Plaintiffs, or their Ancestors, were alway seised of the Lands contained in the Fine, or of some parcel thereof; and so Fines lawfully levied were many times unjustly defeated and adnulled by Jurors of the Country falsly (') and maliciously procured ; We there- fore, intending to provide a Remedy in the Premises, in our Parliament at Westminster, have ordained, that such Exceptions, (Õ) Answers, or Inquisitions of the Coun.try (4) shall from henceforth in no wise be admitted contrary to such Recognizances or Fines. And further We will, that this Statute shall as well extend unto Fines heretofore levied, as to them that shall be levied hereafter. And let the Justices see that such Notes and Fines, as hereafter shall be levied in our Court, be read openly and solemnly, and that in the mean time all Pleas shall cease; and this must be at two certain days in the week, according to the discretion of the Justices.

WE have also ordained, by the advice of our Coun.cil, That from henceforth Sheriffs shall not be charged of any Issues to be levied, nor shall levy any before they pass out of the Exchequer, [there to be delivered by the Extreats of the Justices ;5] and that in the Ex.treats of Justices every head shall be charged for Issues forfeited, like as of Amerciaments. And if peradven- ture any Sheriff will answer for the Issues of any Re- cognisor, Pledge, or Mainpernor, by him [undertaken 6] and returned into our Court, which at the time of the Return is not able to pay such Issues or Amerciaments, the Sheriff shall be charged, and shall answer therefore in our Exchequer. And let the Sheriffs beware under Pain of great Forfeiture, that from henceforth they do make Tallies (Õ) of all such Money as they or their Officers have received by our Commandment: and that they do not return any where the Names of any Main.pernors, Jurors, or any other, except such Mainper.nors, Jurors, or others, according to the tenour of our Writs being dircded to the Sheriffs foi the same Cause, be lawfully and manifestly [impanelled š] thereupon. And they shall not return the names ot any Free.men as Pledges, without that ['hey will plainly con.sent and agree to the same.9] And hereupon We have enacted, that at one time certain every year, one Baron and one Clerk of our said Exchequer shall be sent through every Shire of England, to inroll the names of all such as have paid that yearÕs Debts exafted on them by green Wax ; and the same Baron and Clerk shall view all such Tallies, and inroll them ; and shall hear and determine Complaints made against Sheriffs [and their Clerks] and Bailiffs that have done contrary to the Premises, and the Offenders shall be grievously- punished.

FORASMUCH as Sheriffs and others heretofore have let out by Replevin common Felons, and openly defamed being taken and imprisoned for Murder and [Felony,19] and such as be not replevisable, contraiy to the Form of our Statute of Persons replevisable and not replevisable lately made; whereby such Transgressors not replevisable [be let out, and to deliver them "] de.ceitfully, before the coming of the Justices Errant, or other assigned for their Deliverance, [they procure '*] by themselves and by their Friends Jurors of the Country, and some they threat, whereby as well for fear of the Sheriff, and other that let them at large by Plevin, as for fear of the Thieves ('*) being so de.livered, before the Justices assigned for Gaol Deli.veries such Felonies and Murthers are concealed, and so being concealed, remain still unpunished : We, for the Utility of our Realm, and for the more assured conservation of our Peace, have provided and ordained, that Justices assigned to take Assises in every County

where they do take Assises, as they be appointed, in.continent after the Assises taken, in the Shires, shall remain both together, if they be Lay; and if one of them be a Clerk, then one of the most discreet Knights of the Shire being associate to him that is a Layman, by our Writ shall deliver the Gaols of the Shires, as well within Liberties as without, of all manner of Pri.soners, after the form of the Gaol Deliveries of those Shires before time used. And the same Justices shall inquire then, if Sheriffs or any other have let out by Replevin Prisoners not replevisable, or have offended in any thing contrary to the Form of the foresaid Statute lately made at Westminster; and whom they shall find guilty, they shall chasten and punish in all things ac.cording to the form of the Statute aforesaid.

Or PURCHASING LIBERTIES.*

IT is to be Known, that the King ordained at West.minster the first day of April the seven and twentieth Year of his Reign, that such as would purchase a new Park, and Men of Religion that would amortize Lands or Tenements, should nave Writs out of the Chan.cery to enquire upon the Points accustomed in [all'] Things ; and that Enquests of Lands or Tenements that be worth yearly more than twenty Shillings, that is to wit, by extent, be returned into the Exchequer, and there to make Fine for the Amortisements, or for the Park having, if the Enquests do pass for him that pur.chased them : and after it shall be certified unto the Chancellor or his Deputy, (1) that he take a reasonable Fine therefore, (!) and after make Delivery.

In like manner they shall do, that will purchase Lands, or Tenements holden of the King in chief.

Also People dwelling beyond the Sea, that have Lands, [Tenements,] or Rents in England, if they will purchase Letters of Protection, or will make general Attorneys, they shall be sent unto the Exchequer, and there shall make their Fines, and from thence [shall be sent4] unto the Chancellor or his Deputy, for that which he ought to do therein.

In like manner they shall do, that will purchase any

Fair, Market, Warren, or any other Liberty. Also such as will purchase attermining of their Debts shall be sent into the Exchequer.

Also, such as be not able to travel, and People that dwell in far Countries from the Chancery, which plead or be impleaded, shall have a Writ out of the Chancery to some sufficient Man, that shall receive their Attorneys

when need is.

And for a Remembrance of these Things, there is an Indenture made, divided into three Parts, whereof one Part remaineth in the Chancery, another in the Exche.quer, and the third in the Wardrobe.

JpDWARD by the Grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitain, to the Sheriff of Somerset and Dorset, Greeting: Whereas our Kingdom and the other Lands of our Sovereignty, are filled with divers bad Monies, known by the names of Pollards and Crock- ards, and by other names, which are brought and left in the said Kingdom and elsewhere within our Jurisdiction, by divers Persons coming from abroad, and therein diversely dispersed, to the great damage of Us and all our People 5 We, by the common consent of the Prelates, Earls, and Barons of the same Realm, have thereupon ordained and established a Remedy, according to the Articles following.

* This Title is from the Printed Copies. No Title appear* on the Roll.

Go gle

Falie Money ¥hall not be imported, under For. feiture of Life and Goodi

Appointment

of Warden* at the Port! to enforce thiÈ Afk.

Foreign Sterlings shall be delivered to the Wardens;

and examined by the Assayers.

False Money forfeited.

Wools, Tin, &c. shall be sold only for good Silver, Ac.

Coin, Silver- Plate, Ac. ¥hall not be exported.

First, That from henceforth no man ¥ shall bring such Monies into our said Kingdom, nor elsewhere within our Jurisdiction, under the Penalty of losing Life and Goods, and whatsoever else he can forfeit; So always, that all Persons of whatever Country or Nation they be, may safely bring unto our Ex.change all sorts of Money of good Silver, of whatever foreign Coin or of whatever value they be, without their being forfeit.

And Forasmuch as this Ordinance cannot avail if it be not well maintained ; It is ordained, that good and stri& watch be kept, in all places upon the Sea Coast, at the Ports, and elsewhere, where there is any coming from Abroad, by good and lawful men sworn ; who shall arrest those who bring such or other bad Monies, together with the Monies and every thing belonging to them, and shall send them to him or them who shall have power, on our behalf, to take charge of them. But such power, inasmuch as We are not yet advised what order shall be taken in respeft thereof, We have retained unto Ourselves. And concerning the Arrest aforesaid, We will that it be made after this manner; that is to say, that the Commonalty of each Port choose two good and lawful men of the same Port, for whom the Electors will be answerable, who, together with the Bailiffs of the same Port, shall arrest and search, faith.fully and without sparing, all those who shall arrive within their Wards, and all that they bring with them; and the Bo.dies of those, whom they shall find bringing such or other bad Monies, they shall send without delay to our chief Prison of the County wherein they land. And We will and command that the Keeper of the same Prison do detain and safely keep them, until We be informed of the manner of the Faft, and shall therein have made known our Pleasure. And the Money and other Silver, if any there be, the same Wardens ought to send and deliver unto our great Exchange ; and for other goods, to charge themselves, and answer at our Exchequer.

And Moreover, Whereas We have been informed that the good Sterling is counterfeited in foreign Parts with base and false metal, to the greater damage of our Realm afoiesaid, We have further ordained, that all who shall bring Sterlings from Abroad into the same Realm, or elsewhere within our Jurisdiction, shall and do deliver the same Sterlings to the said Wardens of the Ports where they shall land; and that the same Wardens, under their seals and the seals of those who bring them, and by the lawful testimony of the good men of the same Ports, shall send them forthwith, to the nearest Assayers, who shall be assigned by us to make the Assay of Money. And the same Wardens shall also send their Bodies with the Money, safely and courteously. And if the Assayers shall find the Money to be good and lawful in weight and in Silver, and in all ether things, according to the old standard of England, they shall forthwith free the Persons from Arrest, and deliver them their Money, which they have so brought; and if they be found false, they shall be forfeit, and their Bodies be at our pleasure.

Moreover, It is ordained, that from henceforth none of our Realm, nor within our Jurisdiction, shall sell or barter any Wools, Leather, Woolfells, Lead, or Tin, except for good and lawful Sterlings, or for Silver Plate, assayed and marked at our great Exchange; or in exchange for good and lawful and sufficient Merchandize: And if any doth the contrary, and be thereof attaint by the said Wardens, or by others of our Officers, that the things so sold or bartered shall be for.feit unto Us.

Further, It is ordained that no good Money of Silver, of our Coin or any other, nor any Silver in Plate or otherwise, shall go or be carried forth of our Realm, nor out of our Jurisdiction into foreign Parts, without our special Licence,

And for the due Observance of this Matter, together with the other Points aforesaid, the same Wardens shall use their diligence and labour by all proper means in their power. And the same Wardens before they receive their charge aforesaid, ought to make Oath before the Sheriffs, or before their chief Wardens in places where they are not answerable to the Sheriffs, that they will do and observe faithfully and without any negledi, as much as in them lieth, all that belongeth to their charge, according to the Form aforesaid. And if they release or spare any man for Gift or Favour, or in any other manner, and be thereof attaint, they shall Õincur the forfeiture of Life, and of all that they possess.

Moreover as it hath been ordained, that there should be a Table at Dover and elsewhere, where We shall direct the constant passing to be, for giving change for the necessary expences of those who go and come; We have therefore as.signed John Bellard, John Galeys, and their Companions, to keep the Table at Dover on our behalf for all sorts of Monies. And We will that they do there give change for necessary expences, to those who are going Abroad, and to those who are coming from thence, by the view and testimony of the Controller, whom We shall place there ; and that all Persons who shall come from Abroad, bringing with them Money current within the Jurisdi&ion of the King of France, shall take the same Money to the said Table, and shall there re.ceive to the amount, in Money current within our Realm. And if they be found in any other place with such Money, that the same Money shall be forfeit unto Us, and the For.feiture shall be sent to the said Table for our use.

Wherefore We command you firmly enjoining, that forth.with upon sight of these letters, all the Articles and Points aforesaid you do cause to be proclaimed and published in Cities and Boroughs, Market Towns, Ports, and all other Places throughout your Bailiwick, where you shall think it meet to be done; and Wardens to be appointed and sworn, and this our Ordinance to be kept and observed in the Form abovesaid, under the Pains in the same Form contained.

THE King to the Sheriff of Westmorland. Greeting. Whereas We have of late established that no Man shall bring into our Kingdom, nor elsewhere within our Jurisdic.tion, any bad Monies, as Pollards and Crockards, and other like Monies which are called by divers names, under the Penalty of losing Life and Goods, and whatsoever else he can forfeit ¥, And We have since newly ordained and established, inasmuch as it would be a grievous thing that People, Strangers and of foreign Countries, who knew nothing of that Ordinance, should be by the same so grievously and so soon punished and bound, that the said Penalty of Life should be respited until the Feast of Saint John Baptist nest coming, and from the Feast of Saint John thenceforth that all Merchants who should bring in bad Monies into our Kingdom, or else.where within our Jurisdiction, should incur the Penalty con.tained in the Ordinance aforesaid: And Messengers and Pil.grims who bring no Money but merely for their Expences, shall be sent to the Exchange without incurring the Forfeiture. And that none bring Sterlings from abroad, nor any other manner of Money, but such as shall send the Sterlings or other manner of Money to the Exchange to be changed. And whoever, contrary to the Ordinance proclaimed, shall bring them openly or secretly, and be found with Sterlings or with other manner of Money upon the Sea, his Goods shall be for.feited to Us and his Body taken and ransomed at the King's Will: Wherefore We command you, that the Ordinance afore.said, with this new Addition, throughout your Bailiwick you do cause to be kept and observed. Given at Canterbury, the Twenty-eighth day of May.

Also We command you, that all Wools and other things incurred and forfeited to Us, according to the Form of the Statute aforesaid, without any delay, to the Colleftors of our Custom on Wools in the City aforesaid, well and faithfully Ye do cause to be delivered by Indenture between you and them thereupon to be thereof made:

THE King to the Collectors of his Custom on Wools, in the City of London, Greeting. Whereas of late by Us and our Council It was ordained, That Wools, Leather, Woolfells, Lead, or Tin, should not be bartered or any way sold unless for good Sterlings or other lawful Merchandize, as in the Sta.tute thereon made is more fully contained ; Wherefore We have commanded our Sheriffs of London by our Letters that they, in the several places within their Bailiwick, should de.pute certain and lawful Wardens for the keeping the Statute aforesaid in all its Articles: And now We have understood that Wools and other Merchandize aforesaid are commonly bartered and sold for Pollards and Crockards, and other like Money, contrary to the Form of the Statute aforesaid, to the grievous damage of the People of our Realm: Wherefore We have commanded our Sheriffs of London that they do so carefully and circumspedly provide that the said Wardens, by them the said Sheriffs so deputed, the Statute aforesaid in its several Articles do well and faithfully keep and observe, that We may not have matter or occasion for grievously punishing them the said Sheriffs, for their own default, or that of the Wardens aforesaid therein: And We have in like manner commanded the said Sheriffs, that all Wools and other things in their Bailiwick incurred and forfeited to Us according to the form of the Statute aforesaid, to you for our use, without any delay, (hey shall well and faithfully cause to be delivered, by Indenture between them and you thereupon to be thereof made; We do command you that the Wools and other things, which to you as is aforesaid they shall have delivered, from them Ye do receive, and an Indenture thereof between you Ye do make in form aforesaid: And provide that the Inden.tures aforesaid so by you to be made, Ye do have on the Morrow of St. Michael next coming at our Exchequer, to certify our Treasurer and Barons of the said Exchequer what ye shall have done in the Premises.

ARTICLES upon THE CHARTERS.*

TT'ORASMUCH as the Articles of the Great Charter f of Liberties, and of the Charter of the Forest, the which King Henry, Father of the King that now is, granted to his People, for the weal of his Realm, have not been heretofore observed ne kept, because there was no Punishment [executed upon Ô3 them which of.fended against the points of the Charters before men.tioned ; Our Lord the King hath again granted, renewed, and confirmed them, (Õ) at the request of his Prelates, Earls, and Barons, assembled in his Parliament holden at Westminster, (3) the eight and twentieth year of his Reign, [and hath ordained, enafted, and established certain Articles *] against all them that offend contrary to the points of the said Charters, or any part of them, [or that in anywise transgress them,*3 in the Form that ensueth:

That is to say, That from henceforth the Great Charter of the Liberties of England, granted to all the Com.monalty of the Realm, and the Charter of the Forest, in like manner granted, shall be observed, kept, and maintained in (6) every point, in as ample wise as the King hath granted, renewed, and confirmed them by his Charter. And that the Charters be delivered to every Sheriff of England under the KingÕs Seal, to be read four times in the year before the People in the full County ; that is to wit, the next County day after the Feast of Saint Michael, and the next County day after Christmas, and at the next County after Easter, and at the next County after the Feast of Saint John. And for these two Charters to be firmly observed in every Point and Article, where before no Remedy was at the Common Law, there shall be chosen in every Shire Court, by the Commonalty of the same Shire, three substantial Men, Knights, or other lawful, wise, and well disposed Persons, which shall be Justices sworn and assigned by the KingÕs Letters Patents under the Great Seal, to hear and determine without any other Writ, but only their Commission, such Plaints as shall be made upon all those that commit or offend against any point contained in the foresaid Charters, in the Shires where they be assigned, as well within Franchises as without, and as well [for73 the KingÕs Officers out of their places, as [for 73 other; and to hear the Plaints from day to day without any delay, and to determine them, without allowing the delays which be allowed by the Common Law. And the same Knights shall have power to punish all such as shall be attainted of any Trespass done contrary to any Point of the foresaid Charters, where no Remedy was before by the Com.mon Law, as before is said, by Imprisonment, or by Ransom, or by Amerciament, according to the Trespass.

Nevertheless the King, nor none of those that made this Ordinance intend, that by virtue hereof any of the foresaid Knights shall hold any Plea by the power which shall be given them, in such case where there hath been Remedy provided in times passed, after the course of the Common Law by Writ; nor also that any prejudice should be done to the Common Law, nor to the Char.ters aforesaid in any Point. And the King willeth, that if all Three be not present, or cannot at all times attend to do their office in form aforesaid, that Two of them shall do it. And It is Ordained, that the KingÕs Sheriffs and Bailiffs shall be attendant to do the commandments of the foresaid Justices, as far forth as appertaineth unto their Offices. And besides these things granted upon the Articles of the Charters aforesaid, the King of his special Grace, for redress of the Grievances that his People hath sustained by reason of his Wars, and for the amendment of their Estate, and to the intent that they may be the more ready to do him service, and the more willing to assist and aid him in time of need, hath granted certain Articles, the which he supposeth shall not only be (1) observed of his liege People, but also shall be as much profitable, or more, than the Articles heretofore granted.

[SecondarilyForasmuch as there is a great Griev.ance in this Realm, and damage without Measure, for that the King and the Ministers of his House, as well [of Aliens3] as Denizens, do make [great Prises4] where they pass through the Realm, and take the goods as well of Clerks as of Lay People, without paying therefore any thing, or else much less than the value: It is Ordained, that from henceforth none [do take any such Prisess] within the Realm, but only the KingÕs Takers, and the Purveyors for his House ; and that the KingÕs Takers and Purveyors of his House shall take nothing, but only for his House. And touching such things as they shall take in the Country, of meat and drink, and such other mean things necessary for the House, they shall pay or make agreement with them of whom the things shall be taken. And that all (6) the KingÕs Takers, Purveyors, or [Catours,7] from hence.forth shall have their Warrant with them, under the KingÕs great or petty Seal, declaring their authority, and the things whereof they have power to make Prise or Purveyance ; the which Warrant they shall shew unto them whose goods they take, before they take any thing. And that those Takers, Purveyors, or [Catours7] for the King, shall take no more than is needful or meet to be used for the King, his Houshold, and his Chil.

dren. And that they shall not take any thing for them that be [in Wages9] nor for any other. And that they shall make full answer in the King's House, or in the Wardrobe, for all things taken by them, without making their largesses any other where, or liveries of such things as [they have ,0] taken for the King. And if any Taker for the King's House, by reason of his War.rant, make any Prise or Livery, otherwise than before is mentioned, upon complaint made to the Steward and to the Treasurer of the KingÕs House, the truth shall be enquired. And if he be attainted thereof, he shall forth.with [make agreement with "] the Party, and shall be put out of the KingÕs Service for ever, and shall remain in Prison at the KingÕs pleasure. And if any make Prise without Warrant, and carry it away against the will of the Owner, he shall immediately be arrested by the Town where the Prise was made, and shall be com.mitted to the next Gaol; and if he be attainted there.upon, it shall be done unto him as unto a Felon, if the quantity of the Goods do so require. And concerning Prises made in Fairs, and good Towns, and in Ports for the KingÕs great Wardrobe, the Takers shall have their common Warrant under the Great Seal. And for the things that they shall take, it shall be testified under the Seal of the Keeper of the Wardrobe; and of those things [that they have taken,Ò] the number of the things,

Nevertheless the King and his Council do not intend, by reason of this Estatute, to diminish the KingÕs Right, for the ancient Prises due and accustomed, as of Wines and other Goods, but that his Right shall be saved unto him whole in all Points.

CONCERNING the Authority of [Stewards'] and Marshals, and of such Pleas as they may hold, and in what manner, It is ordained, that from henceforth they shall not hold Plea of Freehold, neither of Debt nor of Covenant, nor of any Contract made between [the KingÕs3] People, but only of Trespass done within the House, and of other Trespasses done within the Verge, and of Contracts and Covenants that one of the King's House shall have made with another of the same House, and in the same House, and none other where. And they shall plead no Plea of Trespass, other than that which shall be attached by them before the King depart from the Verge where the Trespass shall be committed ; and shall plead them speedily from day to day, so that they may be pleaded and determined before that the King depart out of the limits of the same Verge where the Trespass was done. And if it so be that they can.not be determined within the limits of the same Verge, then shall the same Pleas cease before the Steward, and the Plaintiffs shall have recourse to the common Law. And from henceforth the Steward shall not take Cog.nisance of Debts nor of other things, but of People of the same House, nor shall hold none other Plea by Obli.gation made at the distress of the Steward and of the Marshals. And if the Steward or Marshals do any thing contrary to this Ordinance, it shall be holden as void. And Forasmuch as heretofore many Felonies committed within the Verge have been unpunished, because the Coroners of the Country have not been authorized to enquire of such manner of Felonies done within the Verge, but the Coroner of the KingÕs House, which never continueth in one place, by reason whereof there can be no Trial made in due manner, nor the Felons put in exigent, nor outlawed, nor any thing (4) presented in the Circuit, the which hath been to the great damage of the King, and nothing to the good preservation of his Peace j It is Ordained, that from henceforth in cases of the death of Men, whereof the CoronerÕs Office is to make View and Enquest, it shall be commanded to the Coroner of the Country, that he, with the Coroner of the [KingÕs] House, shall do as belongeth to his Office, and inroll it. And that thing that cannot be determined before the Steward [where5] the Felons cannot be at.tached (6) or for other like cause, shall be remitted to the Common Law, so that Exigents, Outlawries, and Pre.sentments, shall be made thereupon in Eyre by the Co.roner of the Country, as well as of other Felonies done out of the Verge : Nevertheless they shall not omit, by reason hereof, to make Attachments freshly upon the Felonies done.

MOREOVER no Common Pleas shall be from hence forth holden in the Exchequer, contrary to the Form of the Great Charter.

AND on the other Party, the King will, that the Chancellor and the Justices of his Bench shall follow him, so that he may have at all times near unto him some Sages of the Law, which be able duly to order all such Matters as shall come unto the Court, at all Times when need shall require.

THERE shall no Writ from henceforth, that toucheth the Common Law, go forth under [any of the petty Seals.']

THE Constable of the Castle of Dover shall not from henceforth hold any [Plea of a foreign County within *] the Castle Gate, except it touch the keeping of the Castle. Nor shall the said Constable distrain the Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports to plead any otherwhere, nor otherwise, than they ought after the Form of their [Charter obtained of the King for5] their old Franchises confirmed by the Great Charter.

THE King hath granted unto his People, that they

shall have Eleftion of their Sheriff, in every Shire, where the Shrivalty is not of Fee, if they list.

THE King willeth and commandeth, that no Sheriff nor Bailiff shall impanel in Inquests nor in Juries over many Persons (*) nor otherwise than it is ordained by Statute ; and that they shall put in those Inquests and Juries such as be next Neighbours, most sufficient, and least suspicious. And he that otherwise doth, and is attainted thereupon, shall pay unto the Plaintiff his Damages double, and shall be grievously amerced unto the King.

IN Right of Conspirators, false Informers, and evil Procurers of Dozens, Assises, Inquests and Juries, the King hath provided Remedy for the Plaintiffs by a Writ out of the Chancery ; and notwithstanding, he willeth that his Justices of the one Bench and of the other, and Justices assigned to take Assises, when they come into the Country to do their Office, shall upon every Plaint made unto them, award Inquests thereupon without Writ, and shall do right unto the Plaintiffs without Delay.

AND Further, because the King hath heretofore or.dained by Statute, that none of his Ministers shall take no Plea [for Maintenance,5] by which Statute [other Officers6] were not bounden before this time; the King will, that no Officer nor any other, for to have part of the Thing in Plea, shall not take upon him the Bu.siness that is in Suit; nor none upon any such Cove.nant shall give up his Right to another ; and if any do, and he be attainted thereof, the Taker shall forfeit unto the King so much of his Lands and Goods as doth amount to the value of the Part that he hath purchased [for such Maintenance.Õ] And [for this Atteindre,"] whosoever will, shall be received to sue for the King before the Justices, before whom the Plea hangeth, and the Judgement shall be given by them. But it may not be understood hereby, that any Person shall be pro.hibit to have Counsel of Pleaders, or of learned Men in the Law for his Fee, or of his Parents and next Friends.

FROM henceforth the King will, that such Distresses as are to be taken for his Debts shall not be made upon Beasts of the Plough, so long as a Man may find any other, [upon the same Pain that is elsewhere ordained by Statute,9] &c. And he will not that over-great Distresses shall be taken for his Debts, nor driven too far; and if the Debtor can find able and convenient Surety until a Day before the Day limited to the She.riff, within which a Man may purchase Remedy [to '¡] agree for the Demand, the Distress shall be released in the mean Time ; and he that otherwise doth, shall be grievously punished.

[FROM henceforth the King will,1] That the Baili.wicks and Hundreds of the King, nor of other great Lords of the Land, be not let to Fenn at over-great Sums, whereby the People [are!] overcharged by making Contribution to such Ferms.

IN Summons and Attachments in Plea of Land, the Summons and Attachments from henceforth shall con.tain the Term of Fifteen Days full at the least, accord.ing to the common Law, if it be not in Attachment of Assises taken in the King's Presence, or of Pleas before Justices in Eyre during the Eyre.

THAT shall be done with them that make false Re.turns, (4) whereby Right is deferred, as it is ordained in the second Statute of Westminster, with like Pain.

AND Forasmuch as there be more Malefactors in the Realm, than had wont to be, and that Robberies, Burnings, and Manslaughters are committed out of measure, and the Peace little observed, by reason that the Statute which the King not long past caused to be made at Winchester is not observed; the King will, that the same Statute be sent again into every County, [tos] be read and published four times in the Year [and kept in every Point as straitly as the two Great Charters,6] upon the Pains therein limited. And for the observing and maintenance of this Statute, the three Knights that be assigned in the Shires for to re.dress Things done against the said Great Charters, shall be charged, and shall have their Warrant therefore.

FOR Redress of Wastes, and Destructions done by Escheators or Subescheators in the Lands of Wards, as of Houses, Woods, Parks, [Warrens,7] and of all other Things that fall into the KingÕs Hands : the King will that he which hath sustained Damage, shall have a Writ of Waste out of the Chancery against the Escheator for his Aft, or the Subescheator for his Aft if he have whereof to answer; and if he have not, his Master shall answer by like Pain concerning the Damages, as is ordained by the Statute for them that do Waste in Wardships.

[FROM henceforth,*] where the Escheator or the She.riff [shall seize9] other MenÕs Lands into the KingÕs hands where there is no Cause of Seiser, and after, when it is found no Cause, the Profits taken in the mean Time have been still retained, and not restored, when the King hath removed his Hand ; the King will, that if hereafter any Lands be so seised, and after [it be removed out of his hands'"] by reason that he hath no cause to seize nor to hold it, the Issues shall be fully restored to him to whom the Land ought to re.main, and which hath sustained the Damage.

IT is Ordained, That no Goldsmith of England, nor none otherwhere within the KingÕs Dominion, shall from henceforth [make, or cause to be made,"] any Manner of Vessel, Jewel, or any other Thing of Gold or Silver, except it be of good and true Allay, that is to say, Gold of a certain Touch, and Silver of the sterling Al.lay, or of better, at the Pleasure of him to whom the Work belongeth; and that none work worse Silver than Money; and that no Manner of Vessel of Silver depart out of the Hands of the Workers, until it be essayed by the Wardens of the Craft; and further, that it be marked with the Leopard's Head; and that they work no worse Gold than of the Touch of Paris;

That whosoever be appealed by Provors, being in Prisons which the same Justices do deliver, and wheresoever in our Realm that such Appealees be dwelling (!), that immediately it shall be commanded to the Sheriff, in whose Bailiwick the Parties so appealed be commorant or may be found, by the KingÕs Writ, under the Testi.mony of the same Justices, that he do take such Persons appealed, and cause them to be brought unto the Gaols where the Appealors be kept that appealed them, and they shall answer there before the same Justices. And if they that be appealed will put themselves upon the Country, it shall be commanded in like manner by a Judicial Writ, from the same Justices to the Sheriff, in whose Liberty the Felonies were done, of which they were appealed, that he shall cause an Enquest of the Country to come before the same Justices, unto the same place where the Appealors be kept, at a certain Day.

A STATUTE for ESCHEATORS.*

AT the Parliament of our Lord the King at Lincoln, in the Utas of Saint Hilary, the twenty-ninth year of his Reign, by his Council it was agreed, [and also commanded by the King himself, That from thence it should be observed and done'] according to the advice of the Reverend Father W. Langton, the Bishop of Co.ventry and Litchfield, and Treasurer to the King, John Langton then being Chancellor, [and other of the Coun.cil there present before the King That where Inquests taken by his Escheators, by any of the KingÕs Writs [purchased out of the Chancery being returned,3 ] and it be found by such Inquests, that nothing is holden of the King [whereby the King ought*] to have the custody of such Lands and Tenements by reason of [the!] In.quests taken (6) by his Escheators, that immediately and without any delay the Escheators shall be commanded by the KingÕs Writ had out of the Chancery, to put from their hands all the Lands and Tenements so (Õ) taken into the KingÕs possession ; and if they have taken any profits of such Lands and Tenements so taken into the King's hands by them, from the time that such Lands and Tenements fell into the KingÕs hands, they shall make full restitution to him or them, for whom it was found by Inquests (*) taken by the same Escheators, that such Lands (Õ) ought to remain ; Saving alway to the King, in case that after such time as his Escheators have dis.charged their hands by force of the KingÕs Writ, as before is said, if any thing happen to be found in the Chancery or the Exchequer, or in any other of the King's Courts, whereby the custody of such Lands, (9) whereof the Escheators have discharged their hands in form afore.said, should belong unto the King, that immediately he in whose possession such Lands happen to be, shall be summoned by a Writ out of the Chancery, to be before the King at a certain Day wheresoever, &c. to shew if he can say any thing, wherefore the King ought not to have the Custody of such Lands, according to the form of the Evidences or Remembrances found for the King ; and if he come in, and shew why the custody of such Lands do not belong, or ought not to belong unto the

OF Inquests to be taken before any of the Justices, and wherein our Lord the King is Party how.soever it be; It is agreed and ordained by the King and all his Council, That from henceforth, notwith.standing it be alledged by them that sue for the King, that the Jurors of those Inquests, or some of them, be not indifferent for the King, yet such Inquests shall not remain untaken for that cause ; but if they that sue for the King will challenge any of those Jurors, they shall assign of their Challenge a Cause certain, and the Truth of the same Challenge shall be enquired of ac.cording to the Custom of the Court; and let it be pro.ceeded to the Taking of the same Inquisitions, as it shall be found, if the Challenges be true, or not, after the Discretion of the Justices.

An ORDINANCE of the FOREST.

WHEREAS certain People that be put out of the Forest [for the Purliew, and by the great Men,'] have made Request [to our Lord the King] at this Parliament, that they might be acquitted of [their Charge/] and of Things that the Foresters demand of them, as they were wont [to be;3] Our Lord the King answered [first, That where he had granted Purliew,*] that he was pleased that it should stand in like Manner as it was granted, albeit that the Thing was sued and demanded in an evil Point; nevertheless he willeth and intendeth, that (s) all his demean Lands wheresoever they be, that have been [of the Crown, being re.turned 6] by way of Escheat, or otherwise, shall have Estate of Free-chase and Free-warren, and in such Manner shall be saved and kept to his Use for all manner of [Escheats,7] and for all manner of [Things *] that pleaseth him.

And in Right of them that have Lands and Tene.ments disafforested [for the said Purliew, and such as9] demand to have Common wuthin the Bounds of Fo.rests, the Intent and Will of our Lord the King is, That [from henceforth, where Purliew is, they may claim to be quit of Charge of the Forests. And whereas'¡] the KingÕs Beasts cannot have their Haunt and Repair unto [the Forest-ground," ] as they had, so long as [they "] were within the Forests, that such Folk shall not have Common, nor other Easement within the Bounds of the Woods, nor of the Lands, the which remain in Forest: But if any of them that be disafforested by the [Purliew,"] would rather be within the Forest as they were before, than to be out of the Forest as they be [ now, it pleaseth the King very well that they shall be received thereunto; so that they may remain in their antient Estate, and shall have Common and other Ease.ment ( .*) as well as they had before. Whereupon our Lord the King willeth and commandeth, That his Jus.tices of the Forest on this Side Trent, and beyond Trent, in like Manner shall keep and hold, and cause to be kept and holden straitly, the foresaid Points within their Liberties in the Form above mentioned.

It is no new Thing, that among divers Establish.ments of Laws, which We have ordained in our own Time upon the great and heinous Mischiefs that happen in Writs of Novel Disseisin chiefly above other, We have devised more speedy Remedy in those Writs than was before. And Forasmuch as it chanceth many Times in Assises of Novel Disseisin, that the Tenant doth except against the Plaintiff, that he holdeth the Tene.ments in Demand [jointly Õ] with his Wife, not named in the Writ, and sometime with a Stranger, (*) not named in the Writ, and sheweth forth a Deed testifying the same, and demandeth Judgement of the Writ; It is agreed and ordained, That if the Plaintiff will offer to aver by Assise, that the Day of his Writ purchased, he that alledged the Exception was sole Tenant, so that

Joint-tenancy pleaded in other real Aftions.

neither his Wife, nor any other had any Thing in the said Lands, then the Justices, before whom the Assise is arraigned, shall retain the same Deed safely in their keeping, until the Assise be tried between them there.upon, as that which is in a sort denied. And they shall [let the Party absent to understand by their Writ under their Testimony, and also to the Joint-tenant that is present, of whom the Deed maketh mention,'] that he be present at a certain Day with the other Tenant, to answer unto the Party Plaintiff, as well upon the Ex.ception alledged, as of the Lands demanded and put in View, if it seem expedient for him : At which Day if both that are named Tenants do come in, and do justify the same Feoffment, thev shall answer and maintain the Exception alledged by one of them, and further shall answer unto the Assise as though the original Writ had been purchased against both of them jointly. And if it be proved by Assise, that the Exception was alledged maliciously, to delay the Plaintiff of his Right, [so that they held not'] the same Land jointly the Day of the Writ purchased, then albeit the same Assise do pass for the Tenants, and against the Plaintiff, yet they that alledge the Exception, shall be punished by one YearÕs Imprisonment, whence they shall not be delivered with.out a grievous Fine. And let the Justices be well ad.vised, That from henceforth they do not allow (3) an Exception alledged by the Bailiffs of any such Te.nants. And if he that alledgeth the Exception absent himself at his Day, and the other that is named Joint- tenant do appear, although he that doth appear doth disavow the same Deed, and say that he hath nothing in the foresaid Tenements; nevertheless the Assise shall pass against the Tenant that is absent, by his Default. And if it be found by Assise, that they were not jointly enfeoffed the Day of the Writ purchased, and likewise that the Tenant against whom the Writ was purchased, or another named in the Writ, did disseise the Plaintiff, then, having regard to the Exception that was falsly and maliciously alledged to the hurt of the Party, and to the Disseisin that they made, the Party Plaintiff shall recover his Seisin and double Damages, and they that alledge the false Exception shall have the Punishment aforesaid. But if neither of the Tenants do come at the Day, then upon their Default the Assise shall pass against them. And if it be found thereby, that the same Ex.ception was lawfully and truly alledged, [and] that they which alledged it were jointly seized before the Plaintiff purchased his Writ against them, the Assise shall pass no further, but the Writ shall be abated. The same shall be observed, if both or one only do appear, if it be found by Assise that the Exception afore.said was truly alledged, as before is said. In the same Order it is established and agreed, That in Assises of Mortdauncestor, and Juris utrum, at the first day that the Parties appear in Court, if the Tenant alledge the foresaid Excepdon against the Demandant, shewing a Deed thereupon, and the Demandant will offer to aver by the Assise or Jury, that at the Day of his Writ pur.chased, he that alledged the Exception was sole Tenant, from thence the same Process and Manner of Proceed.ing shall be used in Assises of Mortdauncestor and Writs of Juris utrum, as before is ordained in Assises of Novel disseisin, and like Punishment shall be inflicted upon the Offenders and those that be convidl. In other Writs, whereby Tenements are demanded, such Process shall be made, that if at the first Day that the Parties appear in Court, the Tenant doth alledge the foresaid Excep.tion of a joint Feoffment, and the Demandant will offer to aver by the Country, that the Day of the Writ pur.chased, he that alledged the Exception was sole Te.nant, then the same Process and Manner of Proceeding shall be observed betwixt the Parties until a Jury have passed between them thereupon. And if it be found by the Jury, that the same Exception was truly alledged, then the Writ of the Demandant shall abate ; and if it be founden by the Jury, that the same Exception was

'jpHE King unto All to whom, &cc. Greeting: While We behold the Imperfe&ion of human weakness, and weigh with attentive consideration the burthens far and wide dif.fused that lie upon our shoulders, We are indeed inwardly tormented with divers compunctions, tossed about by the waves of divers thoughts, and are frequently troubled, passing sleepless nights; hesitating in our inmost soul upon what ought to be done, what to be held, or what to be prosecuted; Yet, under Him, who holding in Heaven the Empire over all things, bringeth every thing into existence, and dispenseth the Gifts of his Grace as it pleaseth him, while the Under.standings of Men cannot conceive the greatness of his wisv dom, We do resume our power j Trusring that He will per.fect our AClions in his service, and in the clemency of his goodness will mercifully look upon, and supply our Defi.ciency ; that We relying upon his protection, may be di.rected in the path of our LordÕs Commandments. Truly among all the Things which rest upon our care and anxiety, about this chiefly is our mind busied without intermission, that We may prepare the pleasantness of ease and quiet for our SubjcCts dwelling in our Realm, in whose quiet we have rest, and in their tranquillity we are inwardly cherished with the Odours of satisfaction amidst the Flowers of hoped- for Peace. We have indeed learned, from the information of our faithful Servants and the frequent cries of the op.pressed, whereby we are disturbed with excessive Commotion of Mind, that the People of the said Realm are, by the Officers of our Forests, miserably oppressed, impoverished,

and troubled with many wrongs, being every where molested. For sometimes the Accusations of the Forest, and Indict.ments, commonly so called, are made not by lawful Inquests of good Men and true of the Country, preceding them, as Justice doth require, but upon the Command of one or per.haps two of the Foresters, or upon the Command of one or perhaps two of the Verderers ; who from hatred or other.wise maliciously, that they may extort Money from some one, do accuse or indiCt whom they will; and thereupon do follow grievous Attachments, and the innocent Man is punished, who hath incurred no Fault or Offence at all. Moreover the People is oppressed with the Multitude of Foresters and other Officers, who not having wherewithal to get their living by other means, must needs live upon the neighbourhood of the Forest * and what is worse, they do justify this their way of life in right of their place: Accordingly by selling and giving away, for such Victuals as they want, and in many ways diminishing, and suffering to be diminished the Wood in their Charge, or deputed to their Charge, and the Deer therein being, in successive Process of Time, they do de.stroy and annihilate the same, to the intolerable damage of Us and our Heirs. What further ? It would be difficult to re.late separately the Losses and Grievances which happen in these Matters, as We have heard them: Being therefore desirous to prevent such Oppressions and Grievances, which without heavy Scandal We can no longer suffer to pass with Indifference, by all ways and Means in our Power, and to provide with our most diligent endeavour for the Peace and Tranquillity ot the Inhabitants of our Realm :

FIRST, [We have ordained '] for ourselves and our Heirs, that (Õ) all Trespasses hereafter to be done in our Forests, of Green-hugh, and of Hunting, the Fo.resters within whose Bailiwicks such Trespasses shall happen to be committed, shall present the same at the next Swanimote before the Foresters, Verdors, Regar- dors, Agistors, and other Ministers of the same Forest; and upon such Presentations there before the Foresters, Verdors, (s) and all other Ministers aforesaid, by the Oath as well of Knights as of other lawful and honest Men of the nearest parts where the Trespass so pre.sented shall be done, not suspe&ed, the truth of the Matter shall be [lawfully *] enquired of; and the truth so enquired of, the same Presentations by the common accord and assent of all the Ministers aforesaid, shall be solemnly confirmed and sealed with their Seals. And if an Indictment be in any other manner, it shall be adjudged void.

AND if it happen any of the said Foresters, Regardors, or other Ministers of the same Forests do die, or by Sickness or other means to be hindred, whereby he cannot be present at the same Swanimote, presently the Justice of the same Forest, or his Lieutenant, shall put another in his place., so that the Indictment may be made by all in form aforesaid; and that the Officers which are to be placed, shall be put in as heretofore it hath been used to be, except the Verderors, who shall be ordained by Elettion, and by our Writ,

AND We will, that none of the foresaid Ministers shall hereafter be put in any Assises, Juries, or Enquests to be taken without the Forest.

AND if there be any Surcharge found [of5] the Foresters, or by such other as take upon them to be Officers of the Forests, such Surchargers shall be re.moved and imprisoned according to the discretion of the Justice of the Forest, or his Lieutenant j and they by whom they were placed shall be also punished at our pleasure. And at every Swanimote Inquisition shall be (6) made of Surcharges of Foresters, and other Ministers of the Forest, and of their Oppressions done to our People ; [and Reformation and Punishment shall be done7] as it is ordained before.

AS touching them that [commit'] Trespasses of v- Green-hugh, or Hunting (*) at such Times as the Forest ^Ôgrounds was disafforested ; (J) We will that those Offences shall disafforested, be pardoned, saving such Trespasses which were com.mitted in that Part which [doth 4] remain Forest; yet so, as that the Hedges and Ditches made in the mean time shall be wholly cast down, removed, and avoided; saving our Arrentations, which We will have remain ac.cording to the Assise of the Forest. The Wood which Sjjeuf Woo<1 is felled and cut down shall be removed; and the Wood which is standing shall remain in the Forest. And if any such Wood yet standing be sold, it shall remain in the Forest, and the Seller shall satisfy the Buyer ac.cording to the quantity of the Wood standing in the Forest, and so sold in the mean time, (') as he re.ceived of him.

Statutum

The STATUTE

late it came to the Knowledge of our Lord the King, by the grievous Complaint of the honour.able Persons, Lords, and other Noblemen of his Realm, that whereas Monasteries, Priories, and other Religious Houses were founded to the honour and glory of God, and the advancement of the Holy Church, by the King and his Progenitors, and by the said Noblemen and their Ancestors, and a very great Portion of Lands and Tenements have been given by them to the said Mo.nasteries, Priories, and Houses, and the Religious Men serving God in them, to the Intent that Clerks and Laymen might be admitted in such Monasteries, Pri.ories, and Religious Houses, according to their suf.ficient Ability, and that sick and feeble Men might be maintained, Hospitality, Almsgiving, and other cha.ritable Deeds might be [done, and that in them Prayers might be said '] for the Souls of the said Founders and their Heirs; the Abbots, Priors, and Govemours of the said Houses, and certain Aliens their Superiours, as the Abbots and Priors of (*) Cestercienses, and Pre- monstratenses, and of the [Order3] of St. Augustine, and St. Benedift, and many more of other Religion and Order, have [at their own Pleasures set *] divers unwonted, heavy, and importable Tallages, Payments, and Impositions upon every of the said Monasteries and Houses in Subjedion unto them in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, without the Privity of our Lord the King and his Nobility, contrary to the Laws and Customs of the said Realm ; and thereby the Number of Religious Persons, and other Servants in the said Houses and Religious Places being oppressed by such Tallages, Payments, and Impositions, the Service of God is diminished, Alms [being not given to5] the Poor, the Sick, and Feeble, the Healths of the Living and the Souls of the Dead be miserably defrauded, Hospitality, Almsgiving, and other godly Deeds do cease ; and so that which in Times past was charitably given to godly uses, and to the increase of the Ser.vice of God, is now converted to an evil [end ;6] by Permission whereof (7) there groweth great Scandal to the People, and infinite Losses [and Disheritances are like to ensue to"] the Founders of the said Houses

and their Heirs, unless speedy and sufficient Remedy be provided to redress so many and grievous De.triments : Wherefore our foresaid Lord the King, con.sidering that it would be very prejudicial to him and his People if he should any longer suffer so great, Losses and Injuries to be winked at, and therefore being willing to maintain and defend the Monasteries, Priories, and other Religious Houses (Ô) erefted in his Kingdom, and in all Lands subject to his Dominion, (Õ) and from henceforth to provide sufficient Remedy to reform such Oppressions, as he is bound, by the Counsel of his Earls, Barons, Great Men, and other Nobles (*) of his Kingdom in his Parliament holden at Westminster, [in the five and thirtieth year of his Reign, hath or.dained and enatted :*]

Ò THAT no Abbot, Prior, Master, Warden, or other Religious Person, of whatsoever Condition, State, or Religion he be, being under the KingÕs Power or Ju- risdi&ion, shall by himself, or by Merchants or others, secretly or openly, by any [Device or Means,Ô3 carry or send, or by any Means cause to be sent, any Tax imposed by the Abbots, Priors, Masters, or Wardens of Religious Houses (6) their Superiors, or (7) assessed amongst themselves, out of his Kingdom and his Do.minion, under the Name of a Rent, Tallage, (*) or any kind of Imposition, or otherwise [by the way93 of Exchange, [mutual Sale,10] or other Contratt how.soever it may be termed ; neither shall depart into any other Country for Visitation, or upon any other Colour, by that Means to carry the Goods of their Monasteries and Houses out of the Kingdom and Dominion afore.said. And if any will presume to offend this present Statute, he shall be grievously punished according to the quality of his Offence, and according to his Contempt of the KingÕs Prohibition.

Ò MOREOVER, our foresaid Lord the King doth inhibit all and singular Abbots, Priors, Masters, and Governors of Religious Houses and Places, being Aliens, to whose Authority, Subjection, and Obedience the Houses of the same Orders in his Kingdom and Domi.nion be subject, that they do not at any time hereafter impose, or by any means assess any Tallages, Payments, [Charges,"] or other Burdens whatsoever, upon the Monasteries, Priories, or other Religious Houses in Sub- jeftion unto them as is aforesaid; and that upon [pain of all that they have or may forfeit.1Õ] Ó

AND Further, our Lord the King hath ordained and established, That the Abbots of the Orders of Cester- cienses and Premonstracenses, and other religious Or.ders, whose Seal hath heretofore been used to remain only in the Custody of the Abbot, and not of the Covent, shall hereafter have a common Seal, and [that shall remain,J] in the Custody of the Prior of the Monastery or House, and Four of the most worthy and discreet Men of the Covent of the same House, to be laid up in safe keeping under the private Seal of the Abbot of the same House; [so that the Abbot or Prior, which doth govern the House, shall be able of himself to establish nothing, though heretofore it hath been otherwise used.1*] And if it fortune hereafter, that Writings [of Obligations,1'.Õ] Donations, Purchases, Sales, Alienations, or of any other Contracts, be (Ò) sealed with any other Seal than such a common Seal kept as is aforesaid, they shall be adjudged void and of no force in Law.

And though the Publication and open Notice of the Ordinances and Statutes aforesaid was stayed in sus- pence, for certain Causes, sithence the last Parliament, until this present Parliament holden at Carlisle in the Oftaves of St. Hilary, in the five and thirtieth year of the Reign of the same King Edward, (') to the Intent that they might proceed with greater deliberation and advice; Our Lord the King, after full conference and debate had with his Earls, Barons, Nobles, and other great Men (Õ) of his Kingdom, touching the Premisses, by their whole Consent and Agreement hath ordained and enafted, that the Ordinances and Statutes aforesaid, under the Man.ner, Form, and Conditions aforesaid, from the First Day of May next ensuing, shall (J) be inviolably ob.served (*) for ever, and the Offenders of them shall [be punished as is aforesaid.*]

The like Statute, word for word, is sent into all the Coun.ties throughout England.

The King to the Sheriff of Salop, Greeting. Whereas, for the common Weal of the People of our Realm, and the Amendment of the State of our whole Dominion, in our pre.sent Parliament at Carlisle, with the advice of our great Men and Nobles, We have made certain Statutes, which We do send you signed to be observed, We do command you, firmly injoining, that the same, in two of your County Courts you do cause to be openly read and recited, and the same in all and singular their Articles to be inviolably observed, and this in no wise omit. Witness the King at Carlisle, the Twentieth day of March.

Like Writs are sent to every SherifF throughout England.

The King, to his well beloved in Christ the Abbot of Waverley, Greeting. Whereas for the common Weal of the People of our Realm, &c. as above. We do command you, firmly injoining, that the same every year twice in a full Chapter of your House you do cause to be openly read and recited, and in all and singular their Articles, under the pain in the said Statutes contained, to be inviolably observed.

THE KING tp the Sheriff of York, Greeting. From the grievous Complaint of the People.of our Realm by their several Petitions exhibited before UÈ in our present Parliament at Westminster, We have understood, That as well. Men of Religion and other Ecclesiastical Persons as other Inhabitants of our Realm, by the frequent and various taking, carrying, and driving away of Com, Horses, Carts, Oxen, Cows, and other their Goods and Chattels, by certain our Ministers and others done, and through the frequent Resorts of Great Men, and of the Officers of UÈ, and of the said Great Men, to the Houses and Manors of Men of Religion and other Ecclesias.tical Persons, by lodging there, and by consuming their Goods there found against their Will, and moreover tlirough other undue Burdens, they have been hitherto manifoldly oppressed and impoverished, and from Day to Day by such Takings and Resorts and Extortions, and intolerable Burdens are so much oppressed and grieved, that Divine Worship, Hospitalities, and other Works of Charity in some Places are diminished, and in some Places do cease, and are wholly withdrawn: We there.fore, who are bound to maintain the State of the Church of England, and of the People of our Realm, and to defend them from such Oppressions and Expences, Willing, with regard to these and other like Grievances to afford convenient Remedy, and considering that it would be useful that the Statute, in the Time of the Lord Edward, formerly King of England, our Father, in the Third Year of his Reign at Westminster, against such Delinquents made, should be observed in all its Articles, and that the Offenders should be punished by the Pains in the said Statute contained, according to their De-, merits; by which said Statute it is thus ordained ;

Ç* That none shall come to eat or lodge in any House of Religion of any otherÕs Foundation than of his own, at the Costs of the House, unless he be specially requested by the Governor of the House before his coming thither; nor yet at his own Costs against the Will of the Governor of the same : And by this it is not intended that the Grace of Hospitality should be withdrawn from such as need, nor that the Founders of such Houses should overcharge or grieve them in any Way. And 1 that none by colour of any Kindred, Specialty, or Alliance, or by any other Occasion shall course in anotherÕs Park, nor fish in anotherÕs Pond, nor presume to lodge in the Houses or Manors of Prelates, or Religious Persons, or others whom.soever, at the Costs of the Lords of the said Manors, or at their own Costs, against the Will or Leave of the said Lords, or their Bailiffs of their Manors aforesaid } and if any do chance to enter any such Manor or House with the good Will, or against the Will of the Lord of such Manor or House, or his Bailiff, he shall cause no Window or Door, nor nothing that is shut, to be opened or broken by himself nor by any other, nor no manner of Vidual, nor other Thing shall take by colour of buying nor otherwise: And that none shall presume to thrash Corn, nor to take, carry, or drive away the same, nor any

And also that all they that offend against the Premises or any of them, and thereof be attainted, shall be committed to Prison and be punished according to the Quantity and Manner of the Tres.pass, and after as our Court shall think convenient; and that if they to whom such Trespass was done will sue, the Damage which they have received shall be awarded and restored to them to the Double, and they that have done the Trespass shall be likewise punished in the Manner aforesaid : And althoÕ none will sue in this Behalf We shall have our Suit against such Trespassers as for a Thing committed against our Commandment, and our Peace. And We shall make En.quiry from Year to Year what Persons do such Trespasses, after as We shall think convenient; and they that be indi&ed by such Inquests of any of the Trespasses aforesaid, shall be at.tached and afterwards distrained by the great Distress, to come into our Court at a certain Day, containing the Space of a Month; and if they come not at that Day they shall be dis.trained again by the same Distress, for to come at another Day, containing the Space of Six Weeks, and if they come not then, they shall be judged as attainted, and shall yield double Damages, at our Suit, to such as have received such Hurt or Damage, and nevertheless shall make grievous Fine, at our Plealure, after the Manner and Quantity of such Trespass.Ó We do command You, that in our City aforesaid, in the Places where you shall see fit, you do cause to be proclaimed and published, and likewise oh our Behalf to be firmly en.joined, that no one under the Pains in the said Statute con.tained, and grievous Forfeiture to Us, do presume to contra.vene the said Statute in any Thing ; or to inflict any such Grievances and Oppressions on Prelates, Men of Religion, Ecclesiastical Persons, Clerks, or Lay-men of whatever State or Condition they be : And that all who shall feel themselves aggrieved by such Oppressions and Grievances, and will re.cover their Damages against such Offenders, shall come to our Chancery for obtaining Remedy therein in their several Cases : And We have injoined our Chancellor that such Remedy he shall not in any Way delay to make to such Complainants. Witness the King at Canterbury on the Eleventh Day of June.

In the same manner it was commanded to the several Sheriffs throughout England.

' meignee, Rot. Slot. 28 Edw. I.

Ò In the first place, Forasmuch as there is a great Grievance in this Realm, and Damage without measure, for that the King and the Ministers of his House, as well Aliens as Denizens, do make their Takings where they pass through the Realm, and take the Goods as well of Clerks as of Lay People, without paying there.fore any thing, or else much less than the value: It is Ordained, that from henceforth none do make any 1 akings within the Realm, but only the KingÕs Takers, and the Purveyors for his House ; and that the KingÕs Takers and Purveyors of his House shall take nothing, but only for his House. And touching such Things as they shall take in the Country, of Meat and Drink, and such other mean Things necessary for the House, they shall pay or make agreement with them of whom the Things shall be taken. And that all such the KingÕs Takers, Purveyors, or Buyers from henceforth shall have their Warrant with them, under the KingÕs Great or Petty Seal, declaring their Authority, and the Things whereof they have power to make Prise or Pur.veyance ; the which Warrant they shall shew unto them whose Goods they take, before they take any thing. And that those Takers, Purveyors, or Buyers for the King, shall take no more than is needful or meet to be used for the King, his Household, and that of his Children : and that they shall not take any thing for them that be at Wages, nor for any other. And that they shall make full Answer in the KingÕs House, or in the Wardrobe, for all Things taken by them, without making their Largesses any other where, or Liveries of such Things as have been taken for the King. And if any Taker for the KingÕs House, by reason of his Warrant, make any Prise or Livery, otherwise than before is mentioned, upon Complaint made to the Steward and to the Treasurer of the KingÕs House, the Truth shall be enquired. And if he be attainted thereof, he shall forthwith satisfy the Party, and shall be put out of the KingÕs Service for ever, and shall remain in Prison at the KingÕs Pleasure. And if any make Prise without Warrant, and carry it away against the will of the Owner, he shall immediately be arrested by the Town where the Prise was made, and shall be committed to the next Gaol; and if he be attainted thereupon, it shall be done unto him as unto a Felon, if the quantity of the Goods do so require. And con.cerning Prises made in Fairs, and good Towns, and in Ports for the KingÕs great Wardrobe, the Takers shall have their common Warrant under the Great Seal. And for the Things that they shall take, it shall be testified under the Seal of the Keeper of the Wardrobe ; and of those Things so by them taken, the Number of the Things, the Quantity, and the Value, there shall be a Dividend made between the Takers and the Keepers of Fairs, Mayors, or Chief Bailiffs of Towns and Ports, by the view of Merchants, whose Goods shall be so taken ; and they shall not be suffered to take any more than is contained in their Divident; and the said Di- vident shall be taken into the Wardrobe under the Seal of the Warden, Mayor, or Chief Bailiff aforesaid, and there shall remain until the Accompt of the Keeper of the KingÕs Wardrobe: Add if it be found, that any hath taken otherwise than he ought to do, upon his accompt he shall be punished by the Keeper of the King's Wardrobe after his desert; and if any make such Prises without Warrant, and be attainted there.upon, he shall incur the same Pain as they which take Prises for the KingÕs Household without Warrant, as before is said. Nevertheless the King and his Council do not intend, by reason of this Estatute, to diminish the KingÕs Right, for the ancient Prises due and ac.customed, as of Wines and other Goods, but that his Right shall be sav ;d unto hint whole in all Points. Concerning the Authority of the Steward and Marshals, and of such Pleas as they may hold, and in what man.ner, It is ordained, that from henceforth they shall .tot hold Plea of Freehold, neither of Debt nor of Covenant, nor of any Contrad made between common People, but only of Trespass done within the House, and of other Trespasses done within the Verge, and of Con.trails and Covenants that one of the KingÕs House shall have made with another of the same House, and in

the same House, and none other where. And they shall plead no Plea of Trespass, other than that which shall be attached by them before the King depart from the Verge where the Trespass shall be committed ; and shall plead them speedily from day to day, so that they may be pleaded and determined before that the King depart out of the Limits of the same Verge where the Trespass was done. And if it so be that they cannot be determined within the Limits of the same Verge, then shall the same Pleas cease before the Steward, and the Plaintiffs shall have recourse to the common Law. And from henceforth the Steward shall not take Cogni.sance of Debts nor of other things, but of People of the same House, nor shall hold none other Plea by Ob.ligation made at the Distress of the Steward and of the Marshals. And if the Steward or Marshals do any thing contrary to this Ordinance, it shall be holden as void. There shall no Writ from henceforth, that toucheth the Common Law, go forth under the Petty Seal.Ó

The which Articles the King that now is, at the Request of his good People of his Realm, having regard to the cau.ses aforesaid, doth will and command that henceforth they be fully holden and kept in all their points. And as to the Request of the said good People with respeft to holding and maintaining Pleas at the Gates of the KingÕs Castles, the King willeth that the Constables of his Castles shall not dis.train People to plead before them any Plea of 3 Foreign County, nor within the County, otherwise than anciently hath been used to be done. And as to the Customs which the King taketh by his Officers, that is to say, of every Ton of Wine two shillings, of every Cloth which Alien Merchants bring into his land two shillings, and of every Pound Value of Avers de poi> three-pence, the King willeth at the Request of the said good People, that the said Customs of Wines, Cloths, and Avers de pois, do cease at his will, in order to know and be advised what Profit and Advantage will accrue to him and his People by ceasing the taking of those Customs, and then the King will have Counsel according to the Advan.tage which he shall see therein; Saving always to the King the antient Prises and Customs antiently due and approved. And as to the other Requests ¥ which the said good People have made to the King, the King hath granted the same fully, and hath charged his Chancellor and his other Officers, that they do cause the same to be firmly kept. And the King willeth, that if any one find himself aggrieved in any point contrary to the said Ordinance, and the said Articles so by him granted, and will complain thereof, that his Chancellor do give him Remedy by Writ according to his case, and according to that which shall seem most expedient to be done.

The King to the Sheriff of York Greeting. Whereas in our Parliament holden at Westminster in one Month after Easter, in the Second year of our Reign, Supplication was made unto Us, on the part of the Commonalty of the said Realm, that We would take care to provide a Remedy upon divers Grievances suffered by the said Commonalty ; and after.wards in our Parliament at Stamford, after the Feast of St. James the Apostle, in the Third year of our Reign, diligent Discussion being had upon the said Supplications, and a cer.tain Ordinance, lately made on some of such grievances by the Lord Edward formerly King of England our Father, being taken into consideration and recited before Us and our Coun.cil, VVe, favourably inclining to the Supplications aforesaid, have caused the said Ordinance, which We will shall hence.forth be firmly observed, together with certain other Articles in the aforesaid Supplications contained, and by Us, in like manner at the Request of the said Commonalty, of our special grace, granted, to be transmitted to you under our Seal; Commanding, that the Ordinance and Articles aforesaid, in your full County Court, you do cause to be read and pub.licly proclaimed, and the Ordinance and Articles aforesaid throughout your bailiwick to be firmly and inviolably ob.served. Witness the King at Langley the Twentieth day of August.

Like Letters are directed to every Sheriff throughout England.

JjÕDWARD by the Grace ot God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquirain, To All to whom these Letters shall come, Greeting. Know Ye, That Whereas on the sixteenth day of March, in the third year of our reign, to the honour of God, and for the weal of Us and of our Realm, We did grant of our free will, by our Letters Patent, to the Prelates, Earls, and Barons of our said Realm, that they might choose certain Persons of the Prelates, Earls, and Barons, whom they should see fit to call unto them; and We did also grant, by the same Letters, to those who should be chosen, whosoever they should be, by the said Prelates, Earls, and Barons, full power to order the State of our House.hold, and of our Realm before mentioned, in such man.ner that their Ordinances should be made to the honour of God and the honour and profit of Holy Church, and to our honour, and to our profit, and to the profit of our People, according to right, and reason, and the Oath which We made at our Coronation (Ô), according as is more fully contained in our said Letters: And the Honourable Father in God Robert, by the grace of God Archbishop of Canterbury, Pri.mate of all England, the Bishops, Earls, and Barons thereunto chosen (.), by virtue of our said Letters, have ordained upon the said Matters in the Form which followeth;

Forasmuch as by bad and deceitful counsel our Lord the King and a',1 his Subjefts are dishonoured in all Lands ; and moreover the Crown hath been in many points abased and dismembered, and his Lands of Gascony, Ireland, and Scotland on the point of being lost, if God do not give amendment; and his Realm of England upon the point of rising, on account of Oppressions, Prises, and Destruflions j

1 For the Form of this Oath, See the Notes at the End of this Ordinance.

1 For the Names of the Ordainers, See Rit. Claus. 3 Ed. 11. m. %d: Rot. Cant MS. Colt. I :ÑRot Cans, also contains the Form of the Election of the Ordainers and the Oath taken by them.

* The Text of these Ordinances is given from an Exemplification of them under the Great Seal of K. Edward II., preserved in the British Museum among the Cotton Charters.

In the Tower of London is preserved, among the Parliament Rolls, a Roll containing these Ordinances, beginning Ô A touz ceux Õ The Roll is of the Time of Edward IL, and is indorsed, in a Hand-writing nearly contemporary, with the Word * OrdinaSies.Õ Several Indorsements in a more modern Hand-writing, have aKo been made on the Roll. The following is in the Hand-writing of Mr. Geo. Holmes, for sixty Years Deputy Keeper of the Records in the Tower, who died in 1748, Ô Rot. Pari, de anno v. Edwardi Secundi, sive Rot. Ordinationum facf per Comiss. Regis t.ingen Statum tocius Regni.Õ In this Roll the Paragraphs or Chapters are numbered, and Abstracts of the Contents are inserted, in the Margin. These are printed in Addition to the Text of the Exemplification. Some Words illegible in the Exemplification have been supplied from this Roll, but which is itself partly defaced ., these and other Readings from the same Roll are marked Rot. Ord. in the Notes.

In the Treasury of Canterbury Cathedral is a Roll marked K. 11, containing these Ordinances. It begins thus Ò Ceux sunt les Noveles Ordenances faites a Lundres lan du regne nostre Scignur Rei Edward, fitz le Rei Edward Quynt: Et par mesme le Rei confermees 8c desouz seon graunt seal enseallees : Et desouz meme le Seal les dites Ordenances 8c le confermement sunt cn la Tresorie de ceste Eglise en Garde.Ó The Instrument under the Great Seal, referred to by the Roll, is not to be found in the Treasury of the Cathedral ; although the numerous and valuable Deeds and Charters there were very carefully arranged and indexed in the Year 1806. The Notes from this Roll are marked Rot. Cant.

A Copy of these Ordinances is entered, in a Hand writing of the Time of Edward II, in MS. Cott. Claudius D. II. fo. 169, 8cc j and another Copy in fo. 197, 8cc. of the same Volume, in a Hand-writing of a subsequent Period. In both Copies the Instrument is divided into Chapters, but not striflly in Accordance with the Numbers on the Roll in the Tower above noticed. The Readings from the more antient Copy are marked MS. Cott. 1 : those from the other Copy MS. Cott. 2. Copies of the Ordinances are in many other Manuscript Collections, but not in any Printed Copies of the Statutes.

the which things being known and shewn, our Lord the King, of his free will hath granted to the Prelates, Earls, and Ba.rons, and to the other good People of his Realm, that certain Persons should be chosen to order and establish the state of his Household and of his Realm, as more fully appears by the Commission of our Lord the King thereof made: Wherefore We, Robert, by the grace of God Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England, the Bishops, Earls, and Barons chosen by virtue of the said Commission, do ordain, to the honour of God and of Holy Church, and to the honour of the King and of his Realm, in the manner which followeth :

First, We do ordain that the Ordinances before made by Us, and shewn to the King ('), be holden and kept, the which are next under written :

Ò FIRST, It is Ordained, That Holy Church have all her Franchises, in such sort as she ought to have.

Ò MOREOVER, It is Ordained, That the Peace of the King be firmly kept throughout the Realm, so that every one may safely go, come, and tarry, according to the Law and Usage of the Realm.

Ò MOREOVER, It is Ordained, For to acquit the Debts of the King and retrieve his State, and the more honourably to maintain him, that no Gift of Land, nor ot Rent, nor of Franchise, nor of Escheat, nor of Wardship, nor Marriage, nor Bailiwick, be made to any of the said Ordainours during their Power under the said Ordinance, nor to any other, without the Consent and Assent of the said Ordainours, or of the greater part of them, or Six of them at the least; but all the things whereof Profit can arise shall be used to the Profit of the King, until his State be becomingly retrieved, and somewhat else be thereupon ordained to the honour and profit of the King.

Ç MOREOVER, It is Ordained, That the Customs of the Realm be kept and received by People of the Realm, and not by Aliens; and that the Issues and Profits of the same Customs, together with all other Issues and Profits of the Realm arising from any matters whatsoever, shall come en.tirely to the KingÕs Exchequer, and by the Treasurer and the Chamberlains shall be delivered, to maintain the Household of the King, and otherwise to his Profit, so that the King may live of his own, without taking Prises other than those an.ciently due and accustomed; and all others shall cease.

Ò MOREOVER, It is Ordained, That all Merchants Aliens, who have received the Profits of the Customs of the Realm, or of other things appurtenant to the King, since the Death of King Edward the Father of our Lord the King that now is, shall be arrested with-all their Goods, wheresoever they shall be found within the power of the King of England, until they have rendered reasonable Account, of how much they have re.ceived of the Issues of the Realm within the time aforesaid, before the Treasurer and before the Barons of the Exchequer, and others joined to them by the said Ordainours.

Ç MOREOVER, It is Ordained, That the Great Charter be kept in all its points in such manner, that if there be in the said Charter any point obscure or doubtful, it shall be declared by the said Ordainours, and others whom they will, for that purpose, call to them, when they shall see occasion and season during their power.Ó

AND Moreover, Forasmuch as the Crown is so much abased and dismembered by divers Gifts, We do ordain, That all the Gifts which have been given to the damage of the King and the Diminution of the Crown since the Commis.sion made to us, of Castles, Towns, Lands and Tenements, and Bailiwicks, Wardships and Marriages, Escheats and Re.leases, whatsoever they be, as well in Gascony, Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, as in England, be repealed, and We do repeal the same altogether, without being given again to the same persons without common assent in Parliament. And that if such manner of Gifts or Releases be from hence.forth given against the form aforesaid, without the assent of his Baronage, and that in Parliament, until that his Debts be

acquitted, and his State becomingly relieved, they shall be holden for none, and the Taker shall be punished in Parlia.ment by the Award of the Baronage.

FORASMUCH as it was heretofore ordained, That the Customs of the Realm should be received and kept by People of the Realm, and not by Aliens ; and that the Issues ami the Profits of the same Customs, together with all other Issues and Profits of the Realm arising, whatsoever they be, should come entirely to the KingÕs Exchequer, and by the Treasurer and Chamberlain be received and delivered for the Mainte.nance of the KingÕs Household, and otherwise to his profit, so that the King might live of his own, without making Prises other than those anciently due and rightful; the which mat.ters are not observed ; Wherefore We do ordain, that the said Customs, together with all the Issues of the Realm as afore is said, be received and kept by People of the Realm, and delivered into the Exchequer in the form aforementioned.

FORASMUCH as the King ought not to undertake Deed of War against any one, nor to go out of his Realm, but by common assent of his Baronage, for the many Perils that may happen to him and his Realm, We do ordain, That the King henceforth shall not go out of his Realm, nor undertake against any one Deed of War, without the common assent of his Baronage, and that in Parliament. And if he otherwise do, and upon such Enterprize cause to be summoned his Service, such Summons shall be for none) and if it happen that the King undertake Deed of War against any one, or go out of the Realm, with the assent of his said Baronage, and it be necessary that he appoint a Guardian in his Realm, then he shall appoint him with the common assent of his Baronage, and that in Parliament.

Of paying all Manner of Issues of the Realm into the Exchequer.

IX. That the King go not out ofthe Realm.

AND Forasmuch as it is to be feared that the People of X. the Land will rise, for the Prises and divers Oppressions That all made in these times, especially because that it was heretofore ordained, That our Lord the King should live of his own, without making Prises other than those anciently due and accustomed, and all others should cease, and nevertheless Prises are made from day to day against that Ordinance, as be.fore ; We do ordain that all Prises fhall cease from henceforth, saving the Prises, antient, rightful, and due to the King, and to others to whom they are due of right. And if any Prises be made contrary to the Ordinance aforesaid, by whomsoever it be, or of whatsoever condition he be ., that is to say, if any, by colour of making Purveyance to the use of our Lord the King, or of another, (hall take Corn, Wares, Merchandizes, or other manner of Goods, against the will of those to whom they belong, and do not render incontinently the Money to the very Value, if he cannot thereof have respite of the good will of the seller, according to that which is comprised in the great Charter, of Prises made by Constables of Castles and their Bailiffs, and moreover the Prises aforesaid which are due being excepted, notwithstanding any Commission which may be, the pursuit of the Hue and Cry shall be raised upon him, and he shall be carried to the next Gaol of the King, and the Common Law shall be done of him as of a Robber or Thief, if he be thereof attainted.

ALSO, new Customs have been levied, and the old en.hanced, as upon Wools, Cloths, Wines, Avoir de pois, and other Things, whereby the Merchants come more seldom, and bring fewer Goods into the Land, and the Foreign Merchants ahide longer than they were wont to do, by which abiding things become more dear than they were wont to be, to the damage of the King and his People ; We do ordain, that all manner of Customs and Imposts levied since the Coronation of King Edward, Son of King Henry, be entirely put out, and altogether extinguished for ever, notwithstanding the Charter which the said King Edward made to the Merchants Aliens, because the same was made contrary to the Great Charter and the Franchise of the City of London, and without the assent of the Baronage ; And if any, of whatsoever condition he be, do take or levy any thing beyond the ancient Customs due and rightful, or make disturbance, whereby the Merchants cannot of their Goods do their will, and thereof be attainted, there

shall be awarded to the Plaintiffs their Damages, having re.gard to the Purchase, to the Suit, to the Costs and Losses which they shall have had, and to the violation of the Great Charter; and the Trespasser shall/ be imprisoned according to the quantity of the Trespass, and according to the discre.tion of the Justices, and he shall never be in the KingÕs Ser.vice ; saving nevertheless to the King the Customs of Wools, Wool-Fells and Leather; that is to say, for each Sack of Wool, half a Mark, and for three hundred Wool-Fells, half a Mark, and for a Last of Leather, one Mark, if the Goods be liable thereto: And henceforth Merchants Strangers shall come, abide, and go according to the ancient Customs, and according to that which of old they were wont to do.

TO the Honour of God and of Holy Church, and against those who by malice do purchase Prohibitions and Attachments against the Ordinaries of Holy Church in causes of corredlions of Sin, and others purely spiritual, which in no wise belong to the Lay Court; We do ordain, that by the Justices, who convid for such malicious doings, and who amerce the mali.cious Plaintiffs, Damages shall be awarded to the Ordinaries injuriously vexed, or if the said Plaintiffs have nothing whereof to pay, Imprisonment shall be awarded for the time according to the Grievance maliciously procured, saving the Estate of the King, and of his Crown, and the Right of others.

AND Forasmuch as the King hath been evil guided and counselled by bad Counsellors, as is aforesaid, We do ordain, that all evil Counsellors be put away and removed altogether, so that neither they nor other such be near him, nor retained in any Office of the King, and other more fit People be put in their Places; And in the same manner shall it be done of their Servants and People of Office, and of others who arc in the KingÕs Household, who are not fit.

AND Forasmuch as many Evils have come to pass by such Counsellors and such Ministers, We do ordain that the King do make the Chancellor, Chief Justice of the one Bench and the other, the Treasurer, the Chancellor and Chief Baron of the Exchequer, the Steward of his Houshold, the Keeper of his Wardrobe, and Comptroller, and a fit Clerk to keep the Privy Seal, a Chief Keeper of the Forests on this Side of Trent, and another on the other Side of Trent, and also an Escheator on this Side of Trent, and another on the other Side of Trent, and the Chief Clerk of the King in the Com.mon Bench, by the Counsel and Assent of his Baronage, and that in Parliament; And if it happen by any chance, that it be expedient to appoint any of the said Ministers before there be a Parliament, then the King shall appoint thereto by the good Counsel which he shall have near him, until the Parliament. And so it shall henceforth be done of such Ministers, when need shall be.

LIKEWISE We do ordain, that all the Chief Wardens of the Ports and the Castles upon the Sea, shall be appointed and made in the Form aforesaid, and that such Wardens be themselves People of the Land.

AND Forasmuch as the Lands of Gascony, Ireland, and Scotland be in peril of being lost for want of good Ministers, We do ordain, that good and sufficient Ministers be appointed to keep watch in the said Lands, in the form contained in the Second Article next above.

MOREOVER We do ordain, that the Sheriffs be from henceforth appointed by the Chancellor, the Treasurer, and the others of the Council who shall be present; and if the Chancellor be not present, they shall be appointed by the 'treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer, and by the Justices of the Bench, and that such be appointed and made who are fit and sufficient and who have Lands and Tenements whereof they can answer to the King arid to the People for their Deeds, and that no other than such be appointed, and that they have their Commission under the Great Seal.

FOKASMUCH as common Fame is, and besides much Proof hath been made, that divers Oppressions, as Disherit- ances, false Indi&ments and Imprisonments, and thereupon grievous Hansoms, and many other manner of Grievances, which the Wardens, Bailiffs, Ministers of the Forest, and others, have done by colour of their Bailiwicks and of their

Offices, of which Grievances the People, who are so much grieved, do not dare openly to complain, nor to prosecute their Suit in the KingÕs Court, while they are in their Bailiwicks and Offices; We do ordain that of all Wardens, Bailiffs, and Ministers of the Forests, who before the Time of the King who now is, have been wont to be removeable at the King's Pleasure as well of those to whom their Bailiwicks and Offices have been already wilfully granted for term of life, notwithstanding such Grant, as of others, their Bailiwicks or Offices shall be seised in the King's hand ; and that good and sufficient Persons be assigned Justices to enquire upon the Grievances aforesaid, and to hear and determine all the Griev.ances and Plaints of all those who will prosecute for the King, or for themselves, against the said Wardens, Bailiffs, and Ministers of the Forests, or others, according to the Law and Custom of the Realm ; and in such sort as the Law will permit, the Plaints shall be determined between this and the Easter next coming, or before, if they can in due manner according to Law. And if the said Wardens, Bailiffs, and Ministers be found guilty of the Grievances aforesaid, then they shall be removed for ever, and if not, they shall have again their Bailiwicks and Offices.

AND Forasmuch as many Petsons have been disherited, fined, and destroyed by the Chief Wardens of the Fo.rests on this side of Trent and on the other, and by other Ministers, against the form of the Charter of the Forest, and against the Declaration which King Edward the Son of King Henry made in the Form which followeth; that is to say ;

ÒWe will and grant for ourselves and our Heirs, that con.cerning Trespasses hereafter to be done in our Forests of Green-Hue and of Hunting, the Foresters within whose Bailiwicks such Trespasses shall happen to be committed, shall present the same at the next Swanimote before the Fo.resters, Verdors, Regardors, Agistors, and other Ministers of the same Forest; and upon such Presentations there before the Foresters, Verdors, Regardors, Agistors, and all other Ministers aforesaid, by the Oath as well of Knights as of other lawful and honest Men of the nearest parts where the Trespass so presented shall be done, not suspefted, the truth of the matter shall be better and more fully inquired of; and the truth so inquired of, the same Presentations by the com.mon Accord and Assent of all the Ministers aforesaid shall be solemnly confirmed and sealed with their Seals : And if an In- di&ment be in any other Manner, it shall be adjudged voidsÓ And because that the Chief Wardens of the Forests have not observed the said Form heretofore, We do ordain, that henceforth no one shall be taken or imprisoned for Green- Hue or Hunting, unless he be found with the Mainour, or indifked in the form before mentioned, and then the Chief Warden of the Forest shall deliver him to Mainprize until the Eyre of the Forest, without taking any thing for his deli.verance. And if the said Warden will not do it, he shall have the Writ in the Chancery which was of old ordained for such Persons indicted, to be at Mainprise until the Evre ; And if the said Warden, after the receiving of the said Writ, do not cause such Persons indifted to be delivered to Main.prise, without taking any thing, then the Plaintiff shall have a Writ in the Chancery to the Sheriff, to attach the Warden before the King, to answer at a certain day, why he hath not replevied him, who is so taken ; And the Sheriff, calling the Verdors, shall cause to be delivered him who is so taken, to good Mainprise, in the presence of the Verdors, and shall cause to be delivered the names of the Mainper.nors to the same Verdors, to answer in Eyre before the Justices. And if the Chief Warden Le thereof attainted, there shall be awarded to the Plaintiffs their treble Damages ; and the said Warden shall be imprisoned and ransomed at the KingÕs Pleasure, and shall never be in the Service of the King. And from henceforth it shall be written to them as to the Chief Wardens of the Forest, because that they cannot be Justices, nor have Record, except in Fvre. And Forasmuch as it is said, that the Chief Wardens o' the Forests have taken and levied Fines, Amercements, and Ran.soms against the Form aforesaid, We do ordain, that the said Wardens, and the other Chief Wardens do render their Ac.counts of the aforesaid Prises before the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer, between this and the Christmas next to come.

Concerning

Piers

Gavaston.

FORASMUCH as it is a Matter known, and proved by the examination of the Prelates, Earls, and Barons, Knights, and other good People of the Realm, that Piers de Gavaston hath evil led and evil counselled our Lord the King, and hath enticed him to do evil in divers and deceitful manners, in ga.thering to himself all the Treasure of the King, and sending the same out of the Realm; in accroaching to himself Royal Power and Royal Dignity, as in making alliances of People by Oaths to live and die with him against all Men, and that by the Treasure which he acquired from day to day; in lording it over the State of the King and of the Crown, in destruc.tion of the King and his People, and especially estranging the KingÕs heart from his Liege People; in despising their coun.sels ; not suffering good Ministers to execute the Law of the Land ; in removing good Ministers, putting in those of his covin, as well Aliens as others, and who at his will and at his command offended against Right and the Law of the Land; in taking the KingÕs Lands, Tenements, and Bailiwicks to him and his Heirs; and hath caused the King to give the Lands and Tenements of his Crown to divers People, to the great Damage and Decrease of the State of the King and of his Crown; and that as well since the Ordinance which the King granted to the Ordainours, to aft for the profit of him and of his People, as before, against the Ordinance of the Ordain.ours ; and maintaining Robbers, Homicides, and causing them to obtain the KingÕs Charter of his Peace, in encouraging evil doers to aft worse ; and in carrying the King into hostile Land without the Assent of his Baronage, to the peril of his Person and the destruction of his Realm ; and in causing to be sealed Blank Charters under the Great Seal of the King, in deceit and disheritance of the King and his Crown, and against his homage; and feloniously, falsely, and traiterously hath done the things aforesaid, to the great dishonour and damage of the King, and disherison of his Crown, and disherison of the People in many ways: And Moreover We, having regard to the Deeds of the most noble King, the Father of ihe King that now is, by whose award the aforesaid Piers abjured the Realm of England, and who willed that our Lord the King his Son should abjure for ever his Company; and that since by the common Assent of all the Realm, and of the King, and of the same Prelates, Earls, and Barons, it was heretofore awarded that he should void the faid Realm, and he did void the fame; and that his Return was never by common Assent, but only by the Assent of some Persons, who, under condition if he should well demean himself after his return, assented thereto: And now for certain is found his evil demeanour; for which demeanour, and for the great evils aforesaid, and for the many others which may happen to our Lord the King and his People, and for nourishing good concord between the King and his People, and to eschew many manners of discords and perils; We do ordain, by virtue of the Commission of our Lord the King to us granted, that Piers de Gavaston, as the open Enemy of the King and of his People, be for ever exiled, as well out of the Realm of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, as from all the Dominion of our Lord the King, as well beyond the Sea as on this Side, for ever, never to return : and that he do void the Realm of England and all the Land, aforesaid, and entirely all the Dominion of our Lord the King, between this and the Feast of All Saints next to come ; and We do give hint Port at Dover, in the form afore.said, and no where else, from whence to pass and go out. And if the said Piers do abide in the Realm of England, or in any other place within the Dominion of our Lord the King, beyond the said Day which is given to him to go out and pass as is aforesaid, then it shall be done of him as of the Enemy of the King and of the Realm, and of his People. And that all those who henceforth shall contravene this Ordinance in respeft of the said Exile, or the penalty thereupon ensuing, it shall be done of them according to that which thereunto pertaineth, if thereof they be attainted.

Franchises and Bailiwicks contrary to that Ordinance, and for that because he hath evil counselled the King contrary to his Oath; We do ordain that he be put out of the King's Counsel fer ever, and that he do never, in any place, come near the King, unless it be at the common Summons of the Parliament, or in War if the King willeth to have him, unless it be by common Assent of the Archbishops, Bishops,

Earls, and Barons, and that in full Parliament, and all other Lands which he holdeth within the Realm of England, shall be taken into the hand of the King of England, and holden until the King hath received of the Issues of those I.ands the Value of all the Esplees which the said Sir Henry hath taken of the Lands received contrary to the said Ordinance. And if the aforesaid Sir Henry do in any point contravene these Ordinances, he shall be disherited fot ever of all the Lands which he hath in England of the Gift of the King.

FORASMUCH as it is found by the Enquiry of the Prc- XXIII. latcs, Earls, and Barons, that the Lady de Vescy hath pro- Concerning cured the King to give to Sir Henry de Beaumont her Brother, de

and to others, Lands, Franchises, and Bailiwicks, to the da- ÕÕ mage and dishonour of the King, and open disherison of the Crown, and also procured to be sent out Letters under die Privy Seal against the Law and the Intent of the King,

We do ordain, that she go to her house, and that within the Quinzime of St. Michael next coming, without ever return.ing to the Court to make stay ; And that for all the Things aforesaid, and because tiiat it is understood that the Castle of Bamburgh belongeth to the Crown, We do also ordain that the said Castle be retaken from her into the KingÕs hand, and that it be not delivered to her nor to any other, except at the King's Pleasure.

AND Forasmuch as the People do feel themselves much XXIV. aggrieved by divers Debts which are demanded of them to Of Acquit- the KingÕs use by Summons of the Exchequer, the which Ònc^*ln Debts are paid, whereof the People have divers Acquittances, some by Tallies and Writs, and others by divers Franchises which were granted to them by Deeds of Kings, which are allowable ., We do ordain, that from henceforth upon the Account of every Sheriff, and of other Ministers of the King, who ought to render account at the Exchequer, such manner of Tallies, Writs, and Franchises be allowed, which are al.lowable upon the Account, if the said Acquittances be shewn to the Court, so that they do not run in demand by default of Allowance ; and if the Treasurer and Barons of the Ex.chequer do not perform this in manner aforesaid, the Plaintiffs shall have their recovery by Petitions in Parliament.

FORASMUCH as common Merchants and many other of XXV the People are received to plead in the Exchequer Pleas of of holding Debt and Trespass, by reason that they are acknowledged Pleas m the by the Ministers of the said Court more readily than they Exchequer, ought to be, whereby the Accounts and other things touching the King are the more delayed, and besides that many of the People are aggrieved ; We do ordain, that from henceforth Pleas shall not be holden in the said Court of the Exchequer, except Pleas touching the King and his Ministers, who are answerable in the Exchequer by reason of tlicir Offices; and the Officers of the same Court, and their Attendants and Ser.vants, who chiefly are abiding with them in the Places where the Exchequer abides; And if any be teceived by the ac.knowledgement of the said Court to plead in the said Exche.quer in the form aforesaid, the Parties impleaded shall have their recovery in Parliament.

Of perform.ing the Office of Coroner within the Verge.

Of Charters of the KingÕs Peace.

LIKEWISE, Forasmuch as the People do feel themselves much aggrieved that the Stewards and Marshals hold many Pleas which do not belong to their Office, and also in this that they will not receive Attornies as well for the Defen.dants as for the Plaintiffs, We do ordain, that from henceforth they receive Attornies as well for the Defendants as for the Plaintiffs, and that they do not hold Plea of Freehold nor of Debt, nor of Covenant, nor of Contrail, nor any common Plea concerning the common People, but only of Trespass of those of the Household, and of other Trespasses done within the Verge, and of Contrails and of Covenants which any one of the KingÕs Household shall have made with others of the same Household, and in the same Household, and no where else ; And that they plead no Plea of Trespass other than that which may be attached by them, before that the King go out of the Verge where the Trespass shall be done, and shall plead them speedily from day to day, so that th'y be pleaded through and determined, before that the King go out of the Limits of that Verge where the Trespass was done ; And if perchance they cannot be determined within the Limits of that Verge, such Pleas shall cease before the Steward, and the Plaintiffs shall sue by the common Law. Nor from henceforth shall the Steward take cognizance of Debts, nor of other things, except of Persons of the House.hold aforesaid, and against Persons of the Household afore.said, nor shall hold none other Plea by Obligation made at the Distress of the Steward and of the Marshals; Nor shall any otie of the Household, nor any who follow the Household, be put in Inquest before them, excepting where the Plaintiff and Defendant be of the same Household, and of Deeds done in the same Household; And if the Steward and Marshals do any thing against this Ordinance, their Deed shall be holden for none ; and they who feel themselves ag.grieved against the said Ordinance, shall have a Writ in Chancery pleadable in the KingÕs Bench, and shall recover their Damages against those who hold the Plea, and who have drawn them into Plea, by the discretion of the Justices, having regard to their Purchase, Costs, Grievances, and Losses, according to the quantity of the Trespass, and they shall never be in the Service of the King.

AND Forasmuch a3 heretofore many Felonies done within the Verge have been unpunished, because that the Coroners of the Country have not been authorised to enquire of such manner of Felonies done within the Verge, but the Coroner of the KingÕs Household, by reason whereof there hath been no Trial made in due manner, nor the Felons put in Exigent, nor outlawed, nor any thing of such Felony presented in Eyre, which is to the great Damage of the King, and the less secure maintenance of his Peace; We do ordain, that from hence.forth in case of Homicide, whereof the CoronerÕs Office is to make View and Inquest, it shall be commanded to the Co.roner of the Country or of the Franchises where the dead Persons shall be found, that he together with the Coroner of the Household do execute the Office which thereunto per- taineth, and shall enter it in his Roll; And of that which cannot be determined before the Steward, because that the Felons cannot be attached or found, or for any other reason, the process shall remain at the common Law, so that the Exigents, and the Outlawries and the Presentments made thereof be shewed in Eyre by the Coroner of the Country, as well as of other Felonies done out of the Verge ; Neverthe.less they shall not omit, by reason hereof, to make Attachments freshly upon the Felonies done ; if they can be found.

FORASMUCH as the People do feel themselves much aggrieved in this, that Persons are emboldened to kill and rob others, because that the King by evil advice giveth so lightly his Peace against the form of Law ; We do ordain, that no Felon nor Fugitive be from henceforth prote&ed or defended from any manner of Felony, by the KingÕs Charter of his Peace granted to him, unless in a case where the King can give grace according to his Oath, and that by Process of Law and the Custom of the Realm, and if any Charter be from hence.forth granted and made in any other manner to any one, it shall avail nothing, and be holden for none: And that no open evil doer against the Crown and the Peace of the Land, be by any one aided or maintained.

FORASMUCH as many Persons are delayed in the King's XXIX. Court of their Demands, because that the Party alledgeth, that the Demandants ought not to be answered without the lnnu4Uy. King, and also many People be aggrieved by the KingÕs Mini.sters against Right, in respedt of which Grievances no one can recover without a common Parliament ; We do ordain, that the King shall hold a Parliament once in the year, or twice, if need be, and that in a convenient Place -. And that in the same Parliaments, the Pleas, which are in the aforesaid form de.layed, and the Pleas whereon the Justices are of divers Opi.nions, shall be recorded and determined. And, in like man.ner the Bills shall be finished which are delivered in Parlia.ment, in such sort as Law and Reason demand.

FORASMUCH as at all times when an Exchange of Mo.ney is made in the Realm, the People are greatly aggrieved in many manners; We do ordain, that when need be, and the King willeth to make an Exchange, that he do it by the com.mon Counsel of his Baronage, and that in Parliament.

LIKEWISE We do ordain, that all the Statutes which have been made in Amendment of the Law, and to the Profit of Of the the People by the Ancestors of our Lord the King, be kept keeping all and maintained in such sort as they ought to be by Law and Sulutc*' Reason, so that they be not contrary to the Great Charter, nor the Charter of the Forest, nor against the Ordinances by us made. And if any Statute be made against the form afore.said, it shall be liolden for none and altogether made void.

XXX Of the Exchange of Money.

FORASMUCH as the Law of the Land and common Right XXXII.

are often delayed, by Letters issued under the KingÕs Privy That the

Seal, to the great grievance of the People, We do ordain, that ,*<e

, , , . , T r , r , , , , Land be not

trom henceforth the Law of the Land and common Right be deiaye(] by

not delayed nor disturbed by Letters of the said Seal; And if Letters of

any thing be done in any of the Places of the Court of our Lord

the King, or elsewhere, by such Letters issued under the Privy

Seal against Right or the Law of the Land, it shall avail

nothing, and be holden for none.

FORASMUCH as many Persons, other than known Mer- XXXIII. chants, do feel themselves much aggrieved and fined by the ^

Statute of Merchants made at A&on Burnell; We do ordain, Merchants that henceforth that Statute shall not hold except between Mer.chants and Merchants, and of Merchandizes made between them, and that the Recognizance be made like as is contained in the said Statute, and by the testimony of four good and lawful Men, who are known, and that their names be entered in the Recognizance to testify the faff, and that to no one shall other Lands be delivered, to hold in the name of Frank Tenement by virtue of the said Statute, except the Burgages of Merchants and their moveable Chatties, and that is to be understood between Merchants and Merchants, known Mer.chants. Moreover We do ordain, that the Seals of the King which be assigned to testify the said Recognizances be deli.vered to the most rich and the most sage, in the undermen.tioned Towns, chosen to such custody by the Commonaltiei of the same Towns; that is to say, at Newcastle upon Tvne,

York, and Nottingham, for the Counties beyond Trent, and the Merchants there coming ar.d abiding; at Exeter, Bristol, and Southampton for the Merchants coming to and abiding in Parts of the South and West; at Lincoln and Northampton, for Merchants there coming and abiding; at London and at Canterbury, for the Merchants coming to and abiding in those Parts; at Shrewsbury, for the Merchants coming to and abiding in those Parts; at Norwich, for the Merchants coming to and abiding in those Parts. And Recognizances made elsewhere than in the said Towns, shall not hold place from henceforth.

FORASMUCH as many Prisoners do become Approvers for the saving of their Lives, and by means of divers Oppres.sions and Pains which Sheriffs and Gaolers, in whose custody they are, do cause to them, and set them on to approve the most rich Persons of the Country, and those of good fame, whom they cause to be attached, and to be put into vile and hard imprisonment, and take grievous ransom of them, from which Imposts and Takings no advantage doth accrue to the King, We do ordain, that from hcncefortlt they who are of good fame being approved by Approvers, who of right ought not to have any voice, shall not be put into Prison, in case they can find good mainprise, to be at the next Gaol Delivery to abide the Law, and to acquit them of the charge according to the

XXXIV. Of letting to Mainprise Persons appealed.

VOL. I.

Go gle

L

XXXV. Of Persons outlawed in Foreign Countries.

XXXVI. Of abating Appeals.

XXXVII. Of deceit by means of Protections.

Usage of the Realm, without taking any thing from them for being let to mainprize. And that at all times when the Gaol- Delivery is delayed by the absence of the Justices, or on other occasion, they shall be left by the said Mainprize, or by other sufficient Security, until the coming of the said Justices in the form aforesaid. Likewise, We do ordain, that they who become Approvers shall not be heard to approve any Man later than three Days next after the time when they become Approvers.

LIKEWISE, Forasmuch as many Persons, Terre-Tenants are appealed, through malice, of divers Felonies in Counties where they have not Lands or Tenements, and by malicious Suit are outlawed, to the loss of their Lives and the disherison of them and of their Heirs; We do ordain, that from hence.forth no Man outlawed by such malicious Suit in the County where he hath not Lands or Tenements, shall be put to death, or disherited, in case that they who by such Suit are out.lawed, do render themselves to the KingÕs Prison, and can acquit themselves by the Counties in which they were out.lawed of the Felonies and other Trespasses, in respe£l of which they were outlawed, and their Lands shall be restored to them when they are acquitted, if they be in the KingÕs Hand ; and if any other than the King be Tenant of the said Tenements they shall have their Recovery by Writ of Entry formed upon the said case ; And they at whose Suit they were so outlawed shall be taken, and shall abjure the Realm, and if they cannot be found, they shall be put in Exigent and outlawed.

Forasmuch as many Persons, by false testimonies of Sheriffs, testifying that they cannot be found, and have not Lands or Tenements by which they can be distrained in their Baili.wicks, albeit they have in other Counties Lands and Tene.ments, are thereby put in Exigent in Counties where they have not Lands or Tenements, and perchance outlawed, in peril of their Lives, and in disherison of them and of their Heirs, if they be outlawed for Felonies; wherefore We do ordain, that Persons outlawed in such manner shall not be put to death, nor disherited of their Lands, in case they render themselves to the KingÕs Prison, and can acquit them.selves by the Counties in which they were so outlawed, that they be not guilty of the Felonies nor of the Trespasses laid to their charge, and they shall have recovery of their Lands and their Damages in form aforesaid.

LIKEWISE, Forasmuch as many Persons are the more em.boldened to kill and rob People, by reason that Appeals pursued in the Court of our Lord the King are abated for too slight causes, and the Appellors taken and imprisoned and ransomed at the King's will, and those appealed at the KingÕs Suit more lightly acquired than they would be if the Appeals were not abated ; We do ordain, that from henceforth Appeals of Felonies be not abated, wherever the Appellors make mention in their Appeals of the Day, and the hour, and the place, and with what weapon the death was infli&ed, and of what manner of Goods the Robbery was ; And if the Appellors can acquit themselves of the said Felonies, they shall have their Recovery upon the Abettors and the Appellors, according to that which is contained in the Statute upon the Abettors of false Appeals, if the Appellees be not indided of such Felonies by solemn Inquest.

FORASMUCH as many Persons are delayed of their Suits in the KingÕs Court, by Prote&ions granted to Persons who pretend to go into the King's Service, and do so only to delay the Suit of the Plaintiff, as well in Plea of Land as in Plea of Debt, and of Trespass; to restrain such malice also, We do ordain, that if the Tenant in Plea of Land do use the Protec.tion of our Lord the King after appearance, and the Deman.dant can aver that the Tenant was not in the King's Service the Day that the parol did demur without Day by reason of the Protedion, the absence of the Tenant shall be turned into a default; And if the Tenant use his Protedion before Ap.pearance, it shall be lawful for the Demandant, if it be pro.fitable to him to take a Writ in the Chancery upon the Tenant, to aver that he was not in the KingÕs Service the Day that the Suit was delayed by the Proiedion, and if the Tenant be con- vid thereof, there shall be awarded to the Demandant his Damages by the Discretion of the Justices, regard being had to his Purchase, Costs, Charges, and Losses, and the Tenant shall be adjudged to Prison for the Deceit done to the King

In MS. Harl. 867, is the Form of this Oath in Latin and French; the former agreeing with the Printed Copy already referred to, and the latter with the Entry on Rot. Claus. 1 Ed. II. See also Rot. Pari. 1 Hen. IV. nu. 16, 17, the Form of the Oath in Latin, which omits the first Sentence of the Oath beginning Ò Si leges Ó and the Answer; but in other particulars agrees with the Printed Latin Copy.

The Form of the Coronation Oath in French, in the Old Abridgement of the Statutes, first printed about 1481, is as follows:

Statute the FtRST.

^ I riHF. King to All to whom, &c. sendeth, Greeting. Of dim. X Understand Ye, That whereas of late (') Times gr'ln^j''0 of our Progenitors sometimes Kings of England, in the Clergy, divers their Parliaments, and likewise after that We had undertaken the Governance of the Realm, in our Par.liaments, many Articles containing divers Grievances, committed (*) against the Church of England, the Prelates and Clergy, were propounded by the Prelates and Clerks of our Realm; and further, great Instance was made that convenient Remedy might be provided therein: And of late in our Parliament holden at Lin.coln, the Ninth year of our Reign, We caused the Articles underwritten, with certain Answers made to some of them heretofore, to be rehearsed before our Council, and made certain Answers to be corrected j and to the Residue of the Articles underwritten, An.swers were made by Us and our Council; of which said Articles, with the Answers of the same, the Tenors here ensue.

FIRST, Whereas Laymen do purchase Prohibitions generally upon Tythes, Obventions, Oblations, Mor.tuaries, Redemption of Penance, violent laying Hands on Clerks or [Converts,1] and in Cases of Defamation, in which Cases [Spiritual Penance ought to be enjoined : *] the King doth answer to this Article, That in Tythes, Oblations, Obventions, Mortuaries, when they are pro.pounded under these Names, the KingÕs Prohibition shall hold no place, although for the long withholding of the same, [the Money may be esteemed at a Sum certain.J] But if a Clerk or a Religious Man do sell his Tythes being gathered in his Barn, or otherwise, to any Man for Money, if the Money be demanded before a Spiritual Judge, the KingÕs Prohibition shall lie ; for, by the Sale, the Spiritual Goods are made Temporal, and the Tythes turned into Chattels.

No Prohibi.tion in Suits for Tythes, &cj

unless they be sold;

ALSO if Debate do arise upon the Right of Tythes, having his Original from the Right of the Patronage, and the Quantity of the same Tythes do come unto the fourth Part of the Goods of the Church, the KingÕs Prohibition shall hold Place, if the Cause come before a Judge Spiritual. Also if a Prelate enjoin a Penance Pecuniary to a Man for his Offence, and it be demanded, the KingÕs Prohibition shall hold Place; but if Prelates enjoin a Penance Corporal, and they which be so punished will redeem upon their own Ac.cord such Penances by Money, if (4) Money be demanded before a Judge Spiritual, the KingÕs Prohibition shall hold no Place.

II.

or arise from the Right of Patronage.

Penance

pecuniary and corporal.

MOREOVER, if any lay violent Hands on a Clerk, the Amends for the Peace broken shall be before the King, and for the Excommunication before a Prelate, that Penance Corporal may be enjoined; which if the Offender will redeem, of his own good Will, by giving Money to the Prelate, or to the Party grieved, it [shall7] be required before the Prelate, and the KingÕs Prohibition shall not lie.

III.

Laying Hanas upon a Clerk.

IN Defamations also Prelates shall correct in Man.ner abovesaid, the KingÕs Prohibition notwithstand.ing : first injoyning a Penance Corporal, which if the Offender will redeem, the Prelate may freely receive the Money, though the KingÕs Prohibition be shewed.

X.

ALSO if any do erett in his Ground a Mill of new, and after the Parson of the same Place demandeth Tythe for the same, the KingÕs Prohibition doth issue in this Form : [Quia de tali molendino haftemis decimae non fuerurit solutae, prohibem9, &c. & sententiam ex- communicationis, si quam hac occasione promulgave- ritis, revocetis omnino. '3 The Answer. In such case the KingÕs Prohibition was never granted by the KingÕs Assent, [nor never shall, which Õ] hath decreed that it shall not hereafter lie in such Cases.

ALSO if any Cause or Matter, the Knowledge whereof belongeth to a Court Spiritual, and shall be definitively determined before a Spiritual Judge, [and doth passÕ] into a Judgement, [and shall not be suspended4] by an Appeal; and after, if upon the same Thing a Ques.tion is moved before a Temporal Judge between the same Parties, and it be proved by Witness or Instru.ments, such an Exception is not to be admitted in a Temporal Court. The Answer. When any one Case (s) is debated before Judges Spiritual [or6] Temporal, as above appeareth upon the Case of laying violent Hands on a Clerk, [it is thought,7] that notwithstanding the Spiri.tual Judgement, the KingÕs Court shall discuss the same Matter [as the Party shall think expedient for himself.8] ALSO the KingÕs Letter (Õ) directed unto Ordinaries, that have wrapped those that be in Subje&ion unto them in the Sentence of Excommunication, that they should assoil them by a certain day, or else that they do appear, and shew wherefore they have excommu.nicated them: The Answer. The King decreeth, That hereafter no such Letters shall be suffered to go forth, but in case where it is found that the KingÕs Liberty is prejudiced by the Excommunication.

ALSO Barons of the KingÕs Exchequer claiming by their Privilege, that they ought to make answer to no Complainant out of the same Place, extend the same Privilege unto Clerks abiding there, galled to Orders or unto Residence, and inhibit Ordinaries that by no Means, or for any Cause, so long as they be in the Ex.chequer, or in the KingÕs Service, they shall not call them to Judgement. The Answer. It pleaseth our Lord the King, That such Clerks as attend in his Ser.vice, if they offend, shall be correct by their Ordinaries like as other; but so long as they are occupied about the Exchequer, they shall not be bound to keep Resi.dence in their Churches. [This is added ,0] of new by the KingÕs Council. The King and his Ancestors since Time out of Mind have used, That Clerks, which are employed in his Service, during such l ime as they are in Service, shall not be compelled to keep Residence at their Benefices; and such Things as be thought ne.cessary for the King and the Commonwealth, ought not to be said to be prejudicial to the Liberty of the Church.

ALSO the KingÕs Officers, as Sheriffs and other, do enter into the Fees of the Church to take Distresses, and sometime they take the ParsonÕs Beasts in the KingÕs Highway, where they have nothing but the Land be.longing to the Church. The Answer. The KingÕs Pleasure is, That from henceforth such Distresses shall neither be taken in the KingÕs Highway, nor in the Fees wherewith Churches in Times past have been in- dowed ; nevertheless he willeth Distresses to be taken in Possessions of the Church newly purchased by Ecclesiastical Persons.

ALSO where some flying unto the Church, abjure the Realm, according to the Custom of the Realm, and Lay-men or their Enemies do pursue them, and pluck them from the KingÕs Highway, and they are hanged or headed ; and whilst they be in the Church, are kept [in the Church-yard with armed Men,"] and sometime in the Church, so straitly, that they cannot depart from the hallowed Ground to empty their Belly, and cannot be suffered to have Necessaries brought unto them for their Living :

Responsio. Cticus p felonia fugiens ad ecctiam, p immunitate ecctiastica optinend, si asserit se esse cti- cum, regnu no compellat' abjurare; set legi regni se reddens, gaudebit ecctiastica lifetate, juxta laudabilem consuetudinE regni haden9 usitatam.

The Answer. They that abjure the Realm so long Prottaion as they be in the Common Way, shall be in the of PerÇon* KingÕs Peace, nor ought to be disturbed of any š£c^urch Man; and when they be in the Church, their Keepers ln(j abjuring ought not to abide in the Churd. yard, except Neces- tbe Ralm. sity or Peril of Escape do require so. And so long as they be in the Church, [they shall not be compelled to flee away, but they shall have ÔJ Necessaries tor their Living, and may go forth to empty their Belly. And the KingÕs Pleasure is, that Thieves [or Appellors whensoever they will, may confess their Offences unto Priests ; but let the Confessors beware that they do not erroneously inform such Appellors.

ALSO It is desired that our Lord the King, and the X1- great Men of the Realm do not charge Religious Houses, or Spiritual Persons, for Corodies, Pensions, or so- t0 ^ unduly jouming in Religious Houses, and other Places of the charged with Church, or with taking up Horse or Carts, whereby Corodiet, ^ such Houses are impoverished, and GodÕs Service dl- Ptn*'on*' c' minished, and by reason of such charges, Priests and other Ministers of the Church deputed unto divine Ser.vice, are oftentimes compelled to depart from the Places aforesaid. The Answer. The KingÕs Pleasure is, that upon the contents in their Petition, from henceforth they shall not be unduly charged. And if the contrary be done by great Men or other, they shall have remedy after the form of the Statutes made in the Time of King Edward, Father to the King that now is. And like Remedy shall be done for Corodies and Pensions exacted by compulsion, whereof no mention is made in the Statutes.

ALSO if any of the KingÕs Tenure be called before their Ordinaries out of the Parish where they [con.tinue,4] if they be excommunicate for their manifest Contumacy, and after forty days a Writ goeth out to take them, they pretend their privilege, that they ought not to be cited out of the Town and Parish where their dwelling is; and so the King's Writ that went out for to take them is denied. The Answer. It was never yet denied, nor shall be hereafter.

ALSO It is desired that Spiritual Persons, whom our Lord the King doth present unto Benefices of the Church, if the Bishop will not admit them, either for Lack of Learning, or for other cause reasonable, may not be under the Examination of Lay Persons in the Cases aforesaid, as it is now attempted, contrary to the De.crees Canonical, but that they may sue unto a Spiritual Judge, (s) for Remedy, as right shall require. The Answer. Of the ability of a Parson presented unto a Benefice of the Church the Examination belongeth to a Spiritual Judge; and so it hath been used heretofore, and shall be hereafter.

ALSO if any Dignity be vacant, where Ele&ion is to be made, it is moved that the Eleftors may freely make their Election without fear of any Power Temporal, and that all Prayers and Oppressions shall in this Behalf cease. The Answer. They shall be made (ree accord.ing to the form of Statutes and Ordinances.

MOREOVER, though a Clerk ought not to be judged before a Temporal Judge, nor any thing may be done against him that concerneth Life or Member; nevertheless Temporal Judges cause that Clerks fleeing unto the Church, and paradventure confessing their Offences, do abjure the Realm, and for the same cause admit their Abjuration, although hereupon they cannot be their Judges, and so Power is wrongfully given to Lay Persons to put to death such Clerks, if such Per.sons chance to be found within the Realm after their Abjuration ; the Prelates and Clergy desire such Remedy to be provided herein, that the Immunity or Privilege of the Church and Spiritual Persons may be saved and unbroken. The Answer. A Clerk fleeing to the Church for Felony, to obtain the Privilege of the Church, if he affirm himself to be a Clerk, he shall not be compelled to abjure the Realm ; but yielding himself to the Law of the Realm, shall enjoy the Pri.vilege of the Church, according to the laudable Custom of the Realm heretofore used.

ALSO, Notwithftanding that a Confession made be.fore him that is not lawful Judge, [thereof,1 *] is not sufficient whereon Process may be awarded, or Sentence given; yet some Temporal Judges, [though they have been instantly desired thereto, do not deliver to their Ordinaries, according to the Premisses, such Clerks as confess before them their heinous offences, as Theft, Robbery, and Murther, but admit their accusation, which commonly they call an Appeal, albeit to this reaped they be not of their Court, nor can be judged*] or condemned before them (3) upon their own Confes.sion, without breaking of the ChurchÕs Privilege : The Answer. The Privilege of the Church, [being demanded in due form by the Ordinary, shall not be denied unto the Appealour, as to a Clerk.4]

FORASMUCH as our Lord King Edward, Son to King Edward, at his Parliament holden at Lincoln in Quindena Hilarii, in the Ninth Year of his Reign, by the Information of his Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other great Men of the Realm, being summoned to the same Parliament, and also by the grievous Complaint of the People, did perceive great Damage to be done to him, and great Oppressions and Disheritances to his People, by reason unsufficient Sheriffs and Hundreders have been before this Time, and yet be in the Realm ; Our Lord the King intending to eschew such evil Oppres.sions and Disheritances, by the Assent of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other great Estates aforesaid, hath ordained and established in the said Parliament, That the Sheriffs from henceforth shall be assigned by the Chancellor, Treasurer, Barons of the Exchequer, and by the Justices ; and in the Absence of the Chancellor, by the Treasurer, Barons, and Justices: and that none shall be Sheriff, except he have sufficient Land, within the same Shire where he shall be Sheriff, to answer the King and his People j and that none that is Steward or Bailiff to a great Lord shall be made Sheriff, except he be out of Service, [so that he may'] attend to execute the Office of a Sheriff for the King and his People; (Õ).

And in like Manner it is agreed and established, W*10 ,tÕ*b that Hundreds, whether they btlong to the King or to other, shall be kept by convenient and able Persons, H^'dred*. that have sufficient Land within the same Hundred or Shire where the Hundred is: [and that the Chancellor,

Manner aforesaid, without having other Regard .'J

And if any Sheriffs or Hundreders be insufficient at this Hundred

Time, they shall be removed, and other more conve-

nient [put in their rooms j1] and that such Hundreds be ^ui not'd*

leased and bailed to such Persons for a reasonable Rent, OiBÇ.

so that they need not to use Extortion upon the People

by reason of too outragious Ferm; and that no Sheriff

nor Hundreder shall lease his Office to any other in

Ferm or otherwise; and that the Execution of Writs By whum

that come to the Sheriffs, shall be done by the Hun- V^srcwtion^of

dreders sworn and known in the full County, and not

by other, if it be not (!) the open Default or notorious

Disturbance of the Hundreders; and then Execution

shall be done by other Persons meet and s *orn, sj that

the People may know to whom to sue such Executions ;

saving always the Returns of Writs to them that have

them, or ought to have them.

The King to the Sheriff of York, Greeting. We send you a certain Statute made in our Parliament at Lincoln, concern.ing the form of appointing Sheriffs and Bailiffs of Hundreds, and concerning other matters in the said Statute contained, sealed w.th our Seal; commanding you that the said Statute in your full County you do cause to be read, published, and in all its Articles, so much as to you belongeth, firmly and invio.lably to be observed. Witness the King at Lincoln the twen.tieth day of February in the ninth year of his Reign.

Like Letters are directed to the several Sheriffs throughout England.

And Be it Remembered that che same Statute was sealed under the Great Seal, and sent to the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer, and also to the Justices of the one Bench and of the other, to be firmly kept in all its points.

would sue against such Trespassers, the Damages which t)iey might sustain should be awarded and restored to them to the double; and the Trespassers should nevertheless be punished in the form aforesaid; and that if any-wse against whom a Trespass should happen to be done, contrary to the Form of the Statute aforesaid, would not sue against such Trespassers, nevertheless our said Father should have his Suit against the aforesaid Trespassers, as for a thing committed against his Commandment and against his Peace ; and that our said Father would direft Inquiries to be made from year to year, as he should think expedient, what persons might have committed any such Trespass : And further that all those who should be imlitted by such Inquests should be attached and afterwards be distrained by the great Distress to come into the Court of our said Father at a certain Day, containing the Space of a Month ; and that if they should not come then, they should be distrained again by the like Distress, to come into the KingÕs Court at a certain Day, containing the Space of Six Weeks : And that if they should not come then, they should be judged as attainted, and be bounden at the Suit of our said Father, to yield double Damages to those who had received such Hurt orDamage; and that nevertheless they should make grievous Fine at the King's Pleasure, after the manner and quantity of their Trespass: Ó as in the Statute aforesaid is more fully contained : And afterwards in the time of our said Father, and likewise in our time, since we have undertaken the government of our Realm, in divers Parliaments both of our Father and ourself, on behalf of the Prelates and Clergy of the aforesaid Realm, grievous Complaints have been pre.ferred, alledging that Sheriffs and other Officers of our said Father in his life-time, and also our Officers in our time have not at all observed the aforesaid Statute ; and that they, not weigh.ing in aught or fearing the aforesaid Penalties, expressed as it is premised in the said Statute, the Com, Victuals, and other Goods, and likewise the Horses Oxen, Waggons, Carts, Ships, and Barges of the Prelates and others of the Clergy, as well within Sanctuary as without, by colour of their Offices and otherwise at their will and pleasure, against the will of the said Prelates and Clergy, and the Keepers of fuch Things and Goods, have taken and driven away; Whereupon the said Prelates and Clergy have many times earnestly besought us to grant them a remedy: We, for the honour of God, and for preserving the Peace and Tranquillity of the Church of Eng.land in time to come, willing that the Statute aforesaid, which was made by our said Father and the whole common Council of his Realm, as it is rehearsed, although it should have been hitherto less fully observed in some or other of the Articles therein contained, should nevertheless be inviolably observed in all things henceforth for ever, do grant and stri&ly command for Us and our Heirs, that no Sheriffs or other Officers of Us or our Heirs, or any other Person what.soever, do presume to thrash any Corn, and the fame or any other Vittuals or Goods, or elfe Horses, Oxen, Waggons, Carts, Ships, or Barges of Prelates, Men of Religion, Rettors of Churches, or of others of the Clergy, under colour of buying or otherwise, in Market-Towns or elsewhere, against the will of the Owners or Keepers thereof to take, carry, or drive awa y, or by occasion thereof to make any Extortion upon any Man, under all and singular the Penalties abovesaid; and that all and singular Persons who shall offend in the Premises, without any excuse whatever, shall be subjett to the Penalties aforefaid : And that all and singular the Officers of Us and our Heirs, that is to say, every of them so far as it may belong to him by reason of his Place, shall upon such as do contrary hereto, execute the Penalties aforesaid ; and that they who shall happen to be committed to Prison for such cause shall not be delivered out of the fame without the especial Command of Us and our Heirs.

The STATUTE of YORK.*

Ex magno Rat. Slat, in Turr. Lond. m. 32.

PUR ceo qe plusurs gentz du Roialme DengletVe, & de la ?re Dirlaunde, unt einz ces houres soventefeth soffert tneschefs & desheritesons, par en- cheson de ceo qe en ascun cas ou defaute de lei fust, remedie ne fust ordene; & aussint p' ceo q as- cuns pointz des estatutz avant faitz avoient mestier desclarsissement: Nre Seign' le Roi Edward, fiz au Roi Edward, desiraunt plenere dreit estre faite a son poeple, a son plement a Everewyk, as tres simoignes de seint Michel, lan de son regne duszisme, par as.sent des Prelatz, Countes, Barons, & la coaute de son reaume illoeqs assemblez, fist les establissementz, & les estatutz qe sensuent, les queus il veut q en le dit roialme & en la dite tre soient fermement tenutz.

En primes pur dieses meschefs, qe unt estez de ceo q les tenantz en assises de novele dissele ne poeint avant ces houres fere attorne; Accorde est q les te.nantz en brefs de novele dissele desore puissent fere attomez. Et nentent mie le Roi p tant q les tenantz & les defendantz, en assises de novele dissele, ne puis.sent pleder p baillif com avant soleient, sil voillent.

Et ensement acorde est, q qant Chartre, quite cla- maunce, aquitance, ou autre escrit, seit dedit en la Court le Roi, en queus soient tesmoignes nomez, seit pees fait de fere venir les tesmoignes, com avant ad este usee: issint q sil ne veignent a la gÕnt destresce sur eus ret'nee, ou q ret'ne seit qil ne unt rien, ou ne sont trovez, q adonk ne seit lessee la prise de len- queste p absence de tieux tesmoignes. Et si les tes.moignes veignent p la g¡nt destresce, & lenqueste p ascune encheson remaigne a p'ndre, seit mesnie le jour done a ceus tesmoignes q issint vendront, qest done a lenqueste pndre ; A queux jour si tieux tesmoignes ne veignent, soient lour issues sur eux primes ret'netz forfeetz, & la prise de lenqueste ne remaigne par lour absence. Et pr absence des tesmoignes, qe sont des franchises, ou brief le Roi original ne court mie, ne seit la prise de tiele enqueste lesse.

Et com il seit contenu en lestatut fait a Westm, le secund jour Daveritt lan du regne Edward pere nre Seign' le Roi qore est vint septime, q les enquestes, & les reconisaunces, devant Justices de lun Bank k de lautre ajugez, fuissent prises devant ascun des Justices des places, associe a li un Chivaler du Counte ou les enquestes sreient a f?ndre, si les enquestes ne fuissent de g"nt examinement; & q en tieles enquestes ^ndre fust fait sicom les Justices verroient q fust a fere, au pfit du Roialme; Le quel estatut ad bo- soigne des? meuz declare : Acorde est q les enquestes & Juretz, q sont 8c ?ront a pWlre en pleez de ?re, qe ne sont mie de g*nt examinement, soient prises en pays devant une Justice de la place ou le pie est, associe a li un pdhome du pays, Chevaler ou autre, Issint q ctein jour seit done en Bank, & c?tein jour & leu, en pays, en p'sence des pties, si demaundaunt le prie.

FORASMUCH as divers People of the Realm of England and Ireland have heretofore many Times suffered gTeat Mischiefs, [Damages,] and Disherisons, by reason that in some Cases where the Law failed, no Remedy was ordained; and also forasmuch as some Points of the Statutes heretofore made had Need of Exposition: Our Lord King Edward, Son to King Ed.ward, desiring that full Right be done to his People, at his Parliament holden at York, the third week after the Feast of Saint Michael, the Twelfth Year of his Reign, by the Assent of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and the Commonalty of his Realm there assembled, hath made these Adis and Statutes here following, the which he willeth to be straitly observed in his said Realm and Land.

FIRST, For divers Mischiefs that have been, because Tenants in Assise of Novel Disseisin might not make Atturnies heretofore: It is agreed that the Tenants in Assise of Novel Disseisin from henceforth may make Atturnies. Yet the King intendeth not hereby that the Tenants and Defendants in Assises of Novel Disseisin should not plead by Bailiffs, if they will, as they have used to do heretofore.

ALSO It is agreed, That when a Deed, Release, Acquittance, or other Writing is denied in the KingÕs Court, wherein Witnesses be named, Process shall be awarded to cause such Witnesses to appear, as before hath been used ; so that if none of them come at the great Distress returned, or if it be returned that they have nothing, or that they cannot be found, yet the taking of the Inquest shall not be deferred by the Ab.sence of such Witnesses. And if the Witnesses do come in at the great Distress, and the Inquest for some Cause remaineth untaken, the Witnesses that come in shall have like Day given them as is assigned for the taking of the Inquest; at which Day, if the Witnesses do not appear, the Issues that were first returned upon them shall be forfeit; and the taking of the Inquest shall not be deferred because of their Absence. And for Absence of Witnesses, dwelling within Franchises where the KingÕs Writ original doth not lie, the taking of an Inquest shall not be omitted.

AND Where it is contained in a Statute made at Westminster the second day of April, in the xxvii. year of the Reign of the KingÕs Father that now is, that Inquests and Recognisances [taken Õ] before Justices of the one Bench and of the other, should be taken before any Justice of the [Places Õ] [accompanied withJ] some Knight of the Shire where such Inquests hap to be taken, if they have not need of great Examination ; and that in such Inquests the Justices shall do as they think most expedient for the wealth of the Realm ; the which Statute needeth to be better declared :

It is agreed, that Inquests and Juries that be and shall be taken in Pleas of Land, that require not great Examination, shall be taken in the Country before a Justice of the [Place*] where the Plea is, [accom.panied with!] a substantial Man of the Country, Knight, or other, so that a certain Day be given in the Bench, and a certain Day and Place in the Country, in the presence of the Parties, if the Demandant request it.

iv.

Justices of Nisi Prius may record Non-suits, Defaults, &c,

Assises of Darrein Presentment &C. [See Slat. IVetlm. I, tb. 30.]

V.

Returns in Liberties shall be made by Indenture between the Bailiff and the Sheriff.

Sheriffs and Bailiffs shall set their Names to their Returns.

VI.

No Officer keeping Assise of Wine and Victuals shall merchandize therein during his Office.

And also the Inquests and Juries, in Pleas of Land that require great Examination, shall Be taken in the Country, in the Manner abovesaid, before two Justices of the Bench:

AND the Justices or Justice shall have power to re.cord Nonsuits and Defaults in the Country, at the Days and Places assigned, as afore is said. And that which they shall have done in the things above mentioned, shall be reported in the Bench at a day certain, there to be inrolled, and thereupon Judgement shall be given. And the King intendeth not, that the said Inquests and Juries should not be taken in the Bench, if they come, nor that this Statute should extend unto great Assises. And also one Justice of the one [Place1] and of the other, [being associate with Õ] a discreet man of the Coun.try, Knight, or other, at the request of the Plaintiff, shall take Inquests upon Pleas pleaded and to be pleaded, that be moved by Attachment and Distress, and shall have power to record Nonsuits as above is said, and to take Inquests upon Defaults there made. And as to (Õ) the Inquests to be taken upon Writs of Quare Impedit, it shall be done as is contained in the Statute of West.minster the Second; and the Justices shall have power to record Nonsuits and Defaults in the Country, and to give Judgement thereupon, as they do in the Bench, and [there to report that which they have done, and there to be inrolled.*] And if it happen, that the Justice or Justices that shall be assigned to take such Inquests in the Country, do not come, or [if they come5] into the Country at the Day assigned, yet the Parties and Persons of such Inquests shall keep their Day in the Bench.

AND Because it is many times complained in the KingÕs Court [upon Returns, that6] Bailiffs of Franchises, having full power to return the KingÕs Writs, have de.livered to Sheriffs, [that have been7] after changed, and otherwise returned into the KingÕs Court, to the great Damage of some of the Parties and the Delay of Right; It is agreed that of Returns which hereafter shall be delivered to the Sheriffs by Bailiffs of such Franchises, an Indenture shall be made between the Bailiff of the Franchise by his proper Name, and the Sheriff by his proper Name. And if any Sheriff change the Return so delivered to him by Indenture, and be thereof convift, at the Suit of the Lord of the Franchise, of whom he received the return, if the Lord have had any Damage, or if his Franchise be imblemished, and at the Suit of the Party that hath sustained Loss through that occa.sion, he shall be punished by the King for his false Return, and shall yield unto the Lord and to the Party double Damages. Also It is agreed, that from hence.forth Sheriffs, and other Bailiffs that receive the KingÕs Writs returnable in his Court, shall put their own Names with the Returns, so that the Court may know [of whom they took such Returns,8] if need be ; and if any Sheriff or other Bailiff leave out his Name in his Returns, he shall be grievously amerced to the KingÕs Use.

ALSO to the common profit of the People, It is agreed, That no Officer in City or in Borough, that by reason of his Office ought to keep Assises of Wines and Viftuals, so long as he is attendant to that Office, shall not merchandise for Wines nor Victuals, neither in Gross nor by Retale : And if any do, and be thereof conviCt, the Merchandize whereof he is conviCt shall be forfeit to the King, and the third part thereof shall be delivered to the Party that sued the Offisiaer, as the KingÕs Gift. And in such Case he that will sue [for a thing so forfeited,6] shall be received: And the Chan.cellor, Treasurer, Barons of the Exchequer, Justices of either Bench, and Justices assigned to take Assises, shall admit such Plaints by Writs, and without Writs, and shall determine them, and shall perform all things con.tained in these Articles in form abovesaid. And never.theless the King may assign his Justices to execute this Thing in Cities and Boroughs, when and where it pleaseth him.

1 Bench * there being associate with him

1 Assisces of Darrein Presentment, and

4 and that which they have done shall he reported into the Bench, and there be inrolled. 5 come not

6 that Returns, which 1 hasve been

* who are answerable for such Returns, 9 to obtain such thing.

Et ausi les enquestes & Jurez en plai de tVe, qe de- maundent g*nt examinement, soient prises en pays, en la fourme susdite, devant deus Justices du Bank : et eyt la Justice ou les Justices poer a recorder non- sutes & defautes en pays, as jours & lieus q €ront assignez, com desus est dir. Et ceo qil avW fait, en les choses susdites, seit reporte en Bank a jour done, & illoeqs enroule, & de ceo jugement rendu. Et nentent mie le Roi q les dites enquestes & Jurez ne pussent estre prises en Bank, si eles veignent, ne q cest estatut sestent a g*nt assises. Et ausi une Justice del un Bank & de lautre, associe a lui un pdhotne du pays, Chevaler ou autre, a la requeste du pleintif, pigne les enquestes des pledz, pledez & a pleder, q sont meuez par attachementz & destresces, Et eyt poer de recorder les nonsutes, com desus est dist, & pndre les enquestes par defautes illoeqs faites. Et qant a les assises de drein p>senl, & les en- questes sur bref de Quare impedit pndre, seit fait com il est contenutz en le secund estatut de Westm; Et eyt la Justice poer de recorder nonsutes, & de.fautes en pays, & sur ceo jugement doner, com en Bank, & seit reporte en Bank ceo q il afa fait, & illoeqs seit en roule. Et si issint aveigne q les Jus.tices ou la Justice q €ront ou sra assigne de pren.dre tieles enquestes en pays, ne veignent pas, ou ne veigne en pays au jour assigne, jadumeyns les parties & les gentz del enqueste gardent lour jour en Bank.

Et si nul vis- counte chaunge ret'n issint life a li p endent'e, & de ceo seit atteint a la suite le Seign' de la fraun- chise dont il afa tiel ret'n resceu, si le Seign' av*a damage encoru ou sa fraunchise seit enblemie, Sc ala sute de la partie q ava damage encorue p cel enche- son, seit puni de vers le Roi com de faus ret'n, & rende au Seign' & a la ptie damage a double. Aussint est acorde q desore Viscontes & autres Baillifs q resceivent brefs le Roi, ret'nables en sa court, met- tent leur ppres nouns ove leur ret'ns, issint q Court puisse savoir a qi p>ndre des deux ret'ns si mestier seit; et si nul visconte, ou autre baillif, en ses ret'ns entre- lesse son noun, seit grevement aiQcie al oeps le Roi.

Ensement por comun pfit du poeple acorde est q nul ministre, en Cite ne en Burgh, qi p reson de son of.fice deit garder assise des vins & des vitailles. tant com il €ra entendaunt a tiel office, ne marchaunde des vins ne des vitalles, en gros ne a retail. Et si nul face, & de ceo seit atteint, la marchaundie dount il €ra ateint seit forfaite au Roi, & la fee pde seit life, com de doun le Roi, a celi a qi sute le trespassour €ra issint ateint. Et en tieu cas seit resceu celi q vodra sure por tieu chose ateindre : Et Chaunceller, Tresorer, Barons del Escheker, Justices del un Bank & de lautre, & Justices assignetz as assises p*ndre, res.ceivent deux pleintes, p brief & sans bref, & les tmi- nent, & pfacent totes les choses contenues en cest article, en la fourme avantdite. Et jadumeyns put le Roi assigner ses Justices a ceste chose pfere en Cites & en Burghs, qant & la ou il plerra.

The STATUTE of WESTMINSTER; the Fourth.*

Concerning Acquittances by Sheriffs.

pORASMUCH as among other Oppressions and Griev.ances, which the People hath felt by Sheriffs and other Ministers, against the Form of the Statutes and other Remedies therefore provided, they have felt themselves much grieved, by this, that some Sheriffs and other Ministers do not acquit, at the Exchequer of our Lord the King, those of whom they have levied Money for the KingÕs use by Summons of the Exchequer, and whereof they have made Tally to the Debtor, or other Acquittance ) and by this, that in Juries of twenty-four the Process hath been tedious} as hath been shewn to our Lord King Edward, Son of King Edward, at his Parliament at Westminster on the Ocflave of St. Michael, in the Fourteenth year of his Reign, by the Complaint of the Commonalty of his Realm: Our Lord the King desiring to provide and apply Remedy, for the Profit of his People j by the Assent of the Prelates, Earls, and Barons, and all the Com.monalty of his Realm, in the said Parliament, hath made and established the Statutes following:

(') Of the Sheriffs and other Ministers, which gather the Debts of the King, and make Tallies and other Acquittances to the Debtors, yet do not acquit them in the Exchequer, and of the same are impleaded in the Exchequer, and by favour are put to little Issues, which they will rather leese then come to answer, and so are the Plaintiffs always charged, to their great Da.mage and Oppression: It is ordained and established, that [the Sheriffs and other Ministers, when they are Õ] impleaded in the Exchequer, [are so far gone in PleaJ] that the great Distress is returned against him, and he cometh not to answer, then shall go forth another Writ of Distress returnable at a certain Day, in which Writ it shall be commanded that Proclamation be made in the full County, that the Defendant come at such a Day, and acquit the [Debt 4] of the Sum for which he made the Tally or Acquittance; at which Day if the Defend.ant come not, and the Writ be returned and Procla.mation certified, he shall be holden for convift, and the Debt taken of him, as Debt recovered in the KingÕs Court, and Damages awarded to the Plaintiff, according to the Discretion of the Barons. And this Statute shall extend as well to those which [weres] Sheriffs and other Ministers, [that let to lease6] their Bailiwicks, as to Sheriffs and other Ministers [which hold their Bailiwicks themselves.7] And it is not the intent of our Sovereign Lord the King, nor of his Council, [nor by this Sta.tute, no man Òj shall be forbidden, but that they may complain of Sheriffs and other Ministers when they shall be found in the Exchequer, and that they shall answer there, as hath been reasonably used before this time.

CONCERNING [Process to be awardedÕ] in Juries of Twenty-four, because that by the Law hitherto used, the Jusrices have not taken such Juries undl all the first Jurors which were alive did appear before them in Court, and those Jurors doubting to be attainted, would rather loose their Issues than appear in Court, by means whereof the Plaintiffs were greatly delayed, and false Oaths seldom times punished ; It is therefore ordained and established, that if the first Jurors which shall be living, appear not in Court before the Justices which shall be assigned such Juries to take, at the first grand Distress upon them returned, or that Return then be made, that they have nothing whereby they may be distrained, that then by their absence [there be no delay made of the Jury observing in all other things the Process in such Juries heretofore used.

Refusing Intercourse between the King and his Nobles.

Removing

of good Ministers and Justices ; and appointing others.

lmlidiing certain Peers and others.

the King, his Ministers, and the Guidance of his Realm, to the Dishonour of the King, the Impoverishment of the Crown, and the Destruction of the Realm, of the Great Men, and of the People, they committed the evil Deeds under-written, in compassing to estrange the Heart of our Lord the King from the Peers of his Land, so that they might have between them two, the sole Government of the Realm.

IN the first place, That Sir Hugh le Despenser the Son was despiteful against the King, and upon that Despite made a Bill, upon which Bill he desired to have in alliance Sirjohn Giffard of Brymmesfeld, Sir Richard de Grey, and others, for the pur.pose of leading the King by violence to a£l according to his will, so that nothing was remiss in him that he had not ac.complished it. The Tenor of which Bill follows underwritten. Ò Homage and the Oath of Allegiance is more by reason of the Crown, than by reason of the Person of the King, and it bindeth itself more unto the Crown than unto the Person; and this appears in that before the Estate of the Crown hath descended, no Allegiance is belonging to the Person ; where.fore if the King by chance be not guided by Reason, in right of the Crown, his liege Subjects are bound by the Oath made to the Crown to guide the King and the Estate of the Crown back again by reason, and otherwise the Oath would not be kept. Now were it to be asked, how they ought to guide the King ? Whether by Course of Law, or by Violence ? By Course of Law a Man will not be able to get Redress, for he will have no Judges but such as are the King's, in which case if the Will of the King be not according to Rea.son, he certainly will have only Error maintained and con.firmed ; Wherefore it bchoveth, in order to save the Oath, that when the King will not redress the matter and remove that which is hurtful to the People at large, and prejudicial to ,the Crown, it is to be determined, that the thing be re.moved by Violence, for He is bound by his Oath to govern the People and his Liege Subje&s, and his Liege Subjeds are bound to govern in Aid of Him, and in his Default.Ó

AND also by their Covin, and evil Practices, they led and evil counselled our Lord the King, so that, with respeft to his personal presence, which he ought in duty to shew to the Great Men and his People, and with respedl to the Favours and Right about which they requested him to answer them, he did nothing, except at the Will and Humour of the said Sir Hugh and Sir Hugh; at once withdrawing the King from his Duty against his Oath, and the Hearts of the Great Men and the Peojile from their Liege Sovereign.

ALSO they, the same Persons, by their false Covin would not suffer the Great Men of the Realm, nor the good Coun.sellors of the King, to speak with nor approach the King, in order well to advise him, nor the King to speak with them, except in the presence and the hearing of the said Sir Hugh and Sir Hugh, or the one of the two, and at their will, and according to their humour, and such things as they pleased ; estranging the Great Men and the good Counsellors of the King from their good will towards their Liege Sovereign, and accroaching to themselves Royal Power, Mastery, and Sovereignty over the person of the King, to the great Disho.nour and Peril of the King, and of the Crown, and of his Realm.

ALSO they, the same Persons, for the purpose of succeed.ing in their wicked ends and desires, to the Disherison of the Great Men of the Land, and the Destruction of the People, removed the good and sufficient Ministers who had been appointed by Assent, and of their covin put in false and evil Ministers, who would not suffer Right to be done; and Sheriffs, Escheators, Constables of Castles, and others in the KingÕs Offices, neither suitable to the King nor to the People; and caused to be appointed Justices not learned in the Law of the Land, to hear and determine things touching the Great Men and the People of the Realm, such as the said Sir Hugh the Father, Sir Ralph de Basset, Sir Ralph Camoys, and Sir John Inge, and others their special allies and sworn friends; and by the covin of such Ministers and their false procurers and favourers, they wrongfully caused to be indited by false Jurors of their alliance the Peers of the Land, that is to say, the Earl of Hereford, Mr John Giffard of Brym.mesfeld, and Mr. Robert of Mohaut and other good Men

through covetousness to obtain their Lands; and so that which ought to be for the Maintenance of Peace and of the good, and the Punishment of the bad, they perverted to the Disherison of the Great Men and the Destruftion of the People.

ALSO, they falsely and wickedly counselled our Lord the King to go with Horse and Arms towards the parts of Glou.cester, and made him traverse the country with Horsemen, and make intursions with his armed men in those parts upon his good People, contrary to the Form of the Great Charter, and the Award of the Peers of the Land ; and so by their false and evil Counsels they would have moved a War in the Land, to the Destruction of Holy Church and of the People, for their own proper Quarrel.

ALSO, Where the Earl of Hereford and the Lord of Wyg- more, by command of the King being assigned to make War against Llewellyn Bren, who had risen against the King In Glamorganshire, as soon as the Lands were in the hands of the King by the death of the Earl of Gloucester, the said Llewellyn surrendered himself to the said Lords, at the King's pleasure for his favour, and those Lords promised him Par.don, and upon such condition they received and delivered him to our Lord the King, and our Lord the King in such form received him; and then as soon as the said Lords were out of the Land, the said Sir Hugh the Son and Sir Hugh the Father, who had accroached Royal Power as above is stated, took the said Llewellyn, and carried him to Cardiff, seeing that Sir Hugh the Son was then seised thereof for his share, and by their covin usurping Jurisdiction in a case where they could not reasonably have any, they there caused him to be drawn, hanged, beheaded, and quartered as a Felon for a thing done in the time of the King ; and in this wise they usurped Royal Power ana Jurisdiction which belonged to the Crown, in Disherison of the Crown, and to the Dishonour of our Lord the King, and of the said Lords of Hereford and Mortimer, and in evil example and great danger perchance in times to come. And also they evil coun.selled our Lord the King to take into his hands the Lands and Chattels of Sir Hugh DÕAudeley the son, and they forejudged him of his Lands without due Process according to the Law of the Land, through covetousness, to obtain for Sir Hugh le Despenser the Son those Lands ; and by other false corn- passings he compassed to have the Lands of Sir Roger Damory ; so that they might obtain by such false compassing the whole of the Earldom of Gloucester, to the Disherison of the Peers of the Land.

ALSO, Where our Lord the King, by his Letters Patent under his Great Seal in full Parliament at Westminster, granted to the Earl of Warwick, that upon his death his Exe.cutors should hold his Lands until the Age of his Heir, the which Grant, after the death of the said Earl, the King con.firmed at his Parliament at Lincoln, at the Request and by the Assent of the Peers of the Land, the said Sir Hugh the Father by the maintenance, abetting, and procurement of the said Sir Hugh his Son, caused our Lord the King to repeal the said Deed without cause, and to deliver to the said Sir Hugh the Father, for his own profit, the Wardship of the same Lands ; so defeating by their evil counsel that which the King had gra nted in his Parliaments by his good Counsel, and by the Assent of the Peers of the Land ; to the Dishonour of the King, and against Right and Rcaaoil.

ALSO they, the same Persons, have not suffered our Lord the King to take reasonable Fines of the Peers of the Land, and others who are within his Fee, in such manner as had been used until these times; but through covetousness to obtain those Lands, by Royal Power accroached to them, have interposed in such matters undue impediments, surmising the Lands to be forfeited, as of Mr. John de Mowbray for the Lands of Gower, and others, to the Damage and Dishonour of our Lord the King, and against the Law of the Land,

in Disherison of the Great Men and others of the Realm, in this wise causing the King to deny Right in Parliament, contrary to his Oath.

ALSO through their evil covetousness, and by Royal Power accroached to them, they would not suffer our Lord the King to hear, or do right to the great Men of the Land, upon the Proof which they made to him, for him and for themselves, of the Disherison of the Crown, and of themselves touching the Lands which belonged to the Templars; and so, by Royal Power unto them accroached, have they led the King, his Council, and his Prelates, that of Things touching them or their Allies, through their Undertakings and Embracery, Right cannot be done except at their Pleasure, to the Damage and Dishonour of our Lord the King, and the Peril of his Oath, and the Disherison and Destruction pf many Great Men, and of the People of the Realm. And also they who have been chosen to Bishopricks, Abbies, Priories, who ought of Right to be received of our Lord the King, where they have been in due Form defied, have not been able to approach to our Lord the King, nor to speak with him to request his favour until they have made Fine and Tribute to Sir Hugh the Son at his plea.sure ¥, and no one who had any Favour to ask of our Lord the King, could obtain the Favour before he had made Fine to him. Besides that, where John de Lachelegh and others were sen.tenced to prison for a Trespass which they had committed against the Lady de Merk, to the Damage of the said Lady, of one thousand and five hundred Marks, whereof they were convified before Mr. Robert de Saddyngle and his com.panions, Justices assigned to hear and determine that Trespass, and the said John was in the prison of Colchester by the afore.said Sentence, Sir Hugh the Son, accroaching unto himself Royal Power, carried away the said John out of Prison, against the Law of the Land, without his having made Satisfaction unto the said Lady of the Damages aforesaid, and made him sell his Land to him, and thereof levy a Fine. The which Evil Deeds above written are notorious and true, as is found by the examination of the F.arls, Barons, and other Peers of the Land.

WHEREFORE We, Peers of the Land, Earls and Barons, in the Presence of our Lord the King, do award, that Sir Hugh le Despenser the Son, and Sir Hugh le Despenser the Father, be disherited for ever, as Disheritors of the Crown, and Enemies of the King and his People ; and that they be utterly exiled out of the Realm of England, without returning at any time, unless it be by the Assent of our Lord the King, and by the Assent of the Prelates, Earls, and Barons, and that in Parliament duly summoned. And We do give them Port at Dover, and none other place elsewhere, to void and pass out of the Realm of England, between this and the Feast of the Be.heading of St.John the Baptist next ensuing, that day included. And if the said Sir Hugh and Sir Hugh do remain in the Realm of England beyond (he said Day which is given to them to void and pass out, as above is said, or if after the said Day they do return, then be it done unto them, as Enemies of the King and of the Kingdom

^^THEREAS in the Parliament of our Lord King Edward Son of King Edward, summoned at Weatminater in Three Weeka after the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, in the Fifteenth year of hia Reign, upon the prayer of Hum.phry de Bohun then Earl of Hereford, and cf diveri other great Men of the Realm, It was assented and accorded,

Ò That no Man, of what Estate or Condition soever he were, for any Alliance whensoever made by Oath, Writing, or other.wise, nor for Ridings made with Banners displayed of the KingÕs Arms or others, not for the seizing, occupying, or de.taining of Castles, Towns, Manors, Lands, Tenements, Goods or- Chattels, or the seizing, imprisoning, or ransoming Per.sons in the KingÕs Allegiance, or other Homicides, Robberies, Felonies, or other Things which might be noted for Trespas.ses or Felonies, done against the KingÕs Peace by the said great Men, their Allies or Adherents, in pursuing and destroy.ing Hugh le Despenser the Son, and Hugh le Despenser the Father, their Allies and Adherents, since the First Day of March, in the Fourteenth Year of the Reign of our said Lord the King, until the Nineteenth Day of August next ensuing, should be appealed or challenged, taken or imprisoned, im.peached, molested, or grieved, nor into judgement brought by the King, nor by any other at the KingÕs Suit, nor at the Suit of any other whomsoever, in the KingÕs Court nor any where else ., But that of all such Trespasses and Felonies they should be acquittedAnd afterwards, unto our Lord the King, at his Parliament summoned at York, in Three Weeks of Easter, in the abovesaid Fifteenth Year of his Reign, it was shewed by the Prelates, Earls, Barons, Knights of Shires, and the Commonalty of his Realm, there assembled by his command, that the said Statute, Ordinance, Provifion, and Acquittance were sinfully and wrongfully made and granted, against Rea.son and common Right, and against the Oath of our Lord the King which he made at his Coronation; and that the Assent which they gave to the said Statute, Ordinance, Provision, and Acquittance, was given for dread of the great Force which the said Earl of Hereford, and the other great Confederates suddenly brought to the said Parliament of Westminster, with Horse and Arms, in Affray and Abasement of all the People ; and that they would not in anywise have assented to the said Statute, Ordinance, Provision, and Acquittance, but by reason of the said outrageous and unjust Force j Wherefore they there besought our Lord the King, that for the Salvation of his Soul and of their Souls, he would cause to be brought before him, in the said Parliament, summoned and holden at York, the Tenor of the said Statute, Ordinance, Provision, and Acquit.tance, and would cause them to be examined, repealed, and wholly made void. And our Lord the King at their Request did cause to be brought before him in the said Parliament, the Tenor of the said Statute, Ordinance, Provision, and Acquit.tance, in the Words that here follow.

Ç< Whereas, of late, divers Great Men of the Realm sur.mised against Sir Hugh le Despenser the Son, and Sir Hugh le Despenser the Father, divers Crimes by them done against the Estate of our Lord the King and his Crown, and in Dis.herison of the Great Men, and destru&ion of the People j and for the prosecuting those Crimes , and for the obtaining

A STATUTE for ESTREATS of the EXCHEQUER.*

Form and Order of Estreats from Chancery into the Exchequer.

rJnHE King, to our well beloved Clerks William de Ayre- mynne, Keeper of the Rolls of our Chancery, and his Companions, Keepers of our Great Seal, Greeting. We send you a Form contained in a Scroll inclosed within these, by Us and our Council ordained, according to which the Estreats of our Chancery, which shall be annually delivered at our Ex.chequer, ought hereafter to be made. And We do will and charge you, that the same Form Ye do cause to be entered in your Rolls, and henceforth to be kept and holden in making the Estreats aforesaid. Moreover We send You another Scroll inclosed within these our Letters, in the which is contained how Justices and Inquirors ought to deliver their Estreats to our said Exchequer. And We charge you, that, that being understood which is contained in the same Scrolls, You do cause to be sent our Writs to the Justices and to others, to do that which therein is contained, in due Form. Given under our Privy Seal at Cowyk the Ninth Day of June in the Sixteenth Year of our Reign.

Because of the Trouble which hath been here.tofore upon the Accompts of Sheriffs in the Exchequer, because that in the Estreats of the Rolls of the Chan.cery, which have been yearly delivered into the Exche.quer, the Accounts thereof have been mingled, the King willeth therefore, that from henceforth the Estreats be made in manner following.

First shall be entered the Fines which most com.monly happen, as to have Writs, and all other Fines wherein the Sum of Money is expressed; and all these manner of Fines of one County for the whole Year shall be written by themselves in one place, and by order of priority, according as the Fine shall be entered in the Rolls; and also of all other Counties generally, whatsoever shall happen [to follow in any one County :'] and for the more ready recourse to the Rolls, if that any Thing in Time to come shall be doubted of, either of the Number or other Letter in the Estreat, the Date of the Day when the Fine was made shall be entered into the Estreat, delivered into the Exchequer.

And after those Fines, then shall be entered Charters, Letters Patent, and Commissions, [in which any Farm or yearly Rent is due to the King, or [wherein Õ] any Accompts are to be made, and these shall be written by Counties severally after the readiest manner.

After these shall be written Homages and Fealties, whereof the Reliefs are to be demanded, and Writs of Diem clausit extremum, and other Things, whereof the Sum is not expressed, nor any yearly Demand to be made.

Lords in this Kingdom, were seised into the Hands of our Sovereign Lord the King, and of divers other Lords of the Fees of them; who [challenged the same Lands for the Consideration aforesaid, that the same Lands ÔJ ought to revert to them as their Escheats: Whereupon, after, in a Parliament of the most noble Prince King Edward, Son of King Edward, summoned and assem.bled at Westminster, Three Weeks after the Day of the Purification of the blessed Virgin Mary, in the Seven.teenth Year of the Reign of the same King, great Con.ference was had before the King himself, in the presence of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, Nobles, and great Men of the Realm, and others there present, whether the foresaid Lords of the Fees, or others which held those Lands that were the foresaid Templers, as is aforesaid, might retain them by the Law of the Realm, and with safe Conscience: Whereupon, the greater Part of the King's Council, as well the Justices as other Lay Per.sons being assembled together, The said Justices affirmed precisely, that our Lord the King, and other Lords of the Fees aforesaid, might well and lawfully, by the Laws of the Realm, retain the foresaid Lands as their Escheats, in regard of the ceasing and Dissolution of the Order aforesaid : But because the Lands and Tenements aforesaid were given to the Brethren of the said Order for the Defence of Christians, and the Holy Land against Pagans and Sarazens, and other Enemies of Christ and Christians, and the Universal Holy Church ; It seemed good to our Lord the King, the Noblemen, and others assembled in the same Parliament, for the Health of their Souls and Discharge of their Con.sciences, That whereas the said Military Order of Tem.plers were originally instituted for the Defence of Chris.tians and the Universal Holy Church, Subversion of the Enemies of Christ and Christians, and canonised to the Augmentation of [the Honour of God and liberal Alms-giving, that the foresaid Lands and Tenements in Demeasnes, Lordships, Services, Liberties, Customs, and all other Things pertaining thereunto, and [by any Thing3] depending thereupon, according to the Wills of the Givers, shall be assigned and delivered to other Men of most Holy Religion ; to the Intent the Fruits, Reve.nues, and Profits of the same Lands, Tenements, and other Things (*) may be converted and charitably dis.posed to godly uses (5): And thereupon in the same Parliament It is agreed, ordained, and established for Law to continue for ever (6), That neither our Lord the King, nor any other Lords of the Fees aforesaid, or any other Person, hath Title or Right to retain the foresaid Lands and Tenements, with the Appurtenances or any Part thereof, in [regard7] of Fscheat, or by any other Means, or hereafter to challenge the same Lands in resped of the ceasing or dissolution of the foresaid Mili.tary Order of Templers, whereof the Brethren of the same Order were seised in their Demesnes as of Fee, at the Time of the ceasing and dissolution aforesaid ; Not.withstanding that the foresaid Lands and Tenements, after the said ceasing and dissolution, came to the Hands of divers Persons by Descent of Inheritance, Gift, or Purchase, or by any other Means; and notwithstanding any Law or Custom of the Realm of England, whereby this [Law, Ordinance, and Statute, touching"] the Assignment and Conveyance of the foresaid Lands and Tenements (Õ) might be hindered, impugned, or coun.terpleaded : [Seeing'¡] the Order of the Brethren of the Hospital of Saint John of Hierusalem was likewise or.dained, instituted, and canonised for the Defence of Christians and the Holy Church : It is agreed and enadled in the said Parliament by our foresaid Lord the King, the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other great Men of the Realm, there being, That insomuch as the foresaid Order of the Templers is ceased and dissolved, and the foresaid Order of the Hospital is provided, instituted, and ca* nonised, for the Defence of Christians, ("J as is afore.said, That all the Lands, Tenements, Lordships, Fees, Churches, Advowsons of Churches, and Liberties, with all Things to them (l!) belonging, which were the said

A.d. 13234,

TemplersÕ at the Time of their ceasing and dissolution, shall be assigned and delivered to the foresaid Order of the Hospital, and to the Prior and Brethren of the same Hospital, to remain to them and their Successors for ever: Wherefore our said Lord the King, by the mutual Assent of the Earls, Barons, and Noblemen aforesaid, (') of his Regal Authority, in the same Parliament hath assigned and determined to deliver all the foresaid Lands, Tenements, Lordships, Fees, Churches, Advow- sons, and Liberties, with their Appurtenances, to the foresaid Order of the Hospital, and to the said Prior and Brethren of the said Order : To have and hold to the same Prior and his Brethren, and (Õ) Successors, for ever, of our Lord the King, and other Lords of the Fees aforesaid, by the same Services, by which the Brethren of the Military Order of Templers held the same, at the Time of their ceasing and dissolution ; as in relieving of the Poor, in Hospitalities, in celebrating divine Ser.vice, Defence of the Holy Land, and [in all other Offices3] and Services before time due, by whatsoever Names they be called. So always that the godly and worthy Will of the foresaid Givers be (*) observed, performed, and always religiously executed, as is afore.said : Saving to every Person his Aftion, if he had any, the Time of the ceasing and dissolution aforesaid, against the same Templers in the foresaid Lands and Tenements, (s) Rents, Services, Customs, Pensions, Corrodies, Liberties, celebrating of Masses, Alms, and other Things whatsoever, and Liberty to prosecute his Right against the said Prior and Brethren of the Hos.pital aforesaid, [and their Brethren6] and their Succes.sors, according to the Law and Custom of the Realm, as he might have had against the foresaid Templers, if the Order aforesaid had not been dissolved: And if it fortune that the said Prior and Brethren of the Hospital aforesaid, or their Successors, shall be put out of the foresaid Lands and Tenements, or of any Parcel thereof, after they shall be seised of the same, they shall have [power to recover their own7] according to the Law of the Realm.

And to the Intent that the Assignment before spe.cified may be published and made known to all Men to whom it behoveth : It is ordained and agreed in the same Parliament, that it shall be openly proclaimed in every County of this Kingdom, that all and every Person holding the Lands and Tenements aforesaid, and all others to whom it doth appertain, shall be at Westminster one Month after Easter Day next, if they will, to hear the Concord, Provisiori, and Assignment aforesaid ; in Form aforesaid. 1

TIE KING commandeth, that all manner of Bailiffs, Sheriffs, and other Officers, as well the [Justices'] of Chester, and [other Bailiffs of these Counties,1] as other, [that be Receivers'] of Wards, (4) of Escheats, [and other'] Bailiwicks, shall be answerable in the Exchequer, and there shall make account to the Treasurer and Barons of the same Place.

AND that all Sheriffs, Fermors, Bailiffs of Franchises, and other, [shall comeš] to the Prefer in the Exchequer, the [Monday7] after the Feast of St. Michael, and the Monday after the Utas of Easter, for to pay their Ferms, Rents, and Issues belonging to the King, (*) and shall bring at the foresaid Terms, the foresaid Ferms, Rents, and Issues [due,] wholly (Õ) into the Exchequer, [as before is mentioned.] And if [they make default, their Bodies'0] shall remain without departing from thence, until [they"] have paid or made Agreement: And he that will not come at the Terms aforesaid, shall be amerced after the [Customu] of the Exchequer: And the Sheriffs and Bailiffs at the same Terms shall bring and pay such Money as (Ó) they have received of the Summons of the Exchequer, and other the KingÕs Debts; and shall be prepared and ready to make [hill Account,4] of the Things aforesaid.

And that all Bailiffs of Franchises, which ought to levy the KingÕs Debts, and be answerable to the Sheriffs thereof, (Õ') shall come and account sufficiently, accord.ing to the Extreats of the Summons of the Exchequer; and such as do not, their Bodies shall remain in Ward of the Sheriffs: And for Default in them, the Sheriffs shall cause the Debts to be levied by their own Bailiffs, [where they have Power,"Ô] as they have used to do in Time passed. And if the Bailiffs do not come in (,7) at the Day that the Sheriff shall give them knowledge, the Sheriff shall enter into the same Franchises, and levy the Debts [with his own Hand."]

Concerning [Justices1*] of Chester, and [Bailiffs thereof,*¡] the King willeth, that they, [or one of them, shall come *'] at the Profer of St. Michael every Year, [when they ought to give account unto the King;11 ] and at the Profer of the Utas of Easter they shall come [likewise,13] and bring in that which they owe to the King for that Term ; and [the Justices'9] of Chester shall have Day to account from Year to Year in Shiindena Pascha; and the [Bailiffs thereof10] the Monday of Easter Utas.

* In those Editions which continue the Statutes beyond Edward II. several Articles have been placed between the Reigns of Edward II. and Edward III. under the Head of Ò Certain Statutes made during the Reigns of K. Henry III. K. Edward I. or K. Edward II. but uncertain when or in which of their Times.Ó The Number and Nature of the Articles so classed vary in the several Editions. Under the present Head are now arranged all such Articles, the exatt Date whereof appears uncertain, but which have been uniformly considered as made previous to Edward III. and which have been admitted either into any Edition of the Antiqua Statuta, or into any general Colleftion of the Statutes.

t Two separate Articles intituled Ô Distridliones (or De Distriffione) Scaccarii,Õ and Ô Statutum de ScaccarioÕ have most generally been attributed to the jist Year of King Henry III; and in the modem Printed Copies have been distinguished as Statutes 4 and 3 of that Year. In RastallÕs Colle&ion, Edit. 1603, it is suggested that they were made in the Reign of Edward I. and this seems confirmed by the Reference to the Ô Statutum de ScaccarioÕ in the Statute of 16 Ed. II. relating to the Form of sending Estreats into the Exchequer. The Various Readings marked MS. Cott. are from the Cotton MS. Claudius D. 2. fo. 224. from whence these Articles were printed by Cay.

And when a Sheriff or Bailiff hath begun his Ac.count, none other shall be received (') to account, until he that was first appointed hath [clearly accounted,Õ] and his Money (Õ) received.

FORASMUCH as the Commonalty of the Realm hath sustained great Damage by wrongful taking of Distresses, which have been made by Sheriffs, and by other the KingÕs Bailiffs, for the KingÕs Debt, or for any other Cause: It is therefore provided [and or.dained,] that when a Sheriff, or any other Man doth take the Beasts of other, they to whom the Beasts do belong may give them their Feeding without Disturb.ance, so long as they be impounded, without giving any Thing for their keeping. And that the Beasts, nor no other Distress taken for the KingÕs Debt, nor for any other Cause, be [given ne] sold within fifteen Days after the Taking.

And if any bring the (Õ) Tally of a Payment made in the Exchequer, the Distress shall cease.

And if he bring the Tally of any Sheriff or Bailiff, of Payment made to them of the Thing demanded, and will find Pledges that he will appear in the Exchequer, upon the next Account, to do as Right shall require, then the Distress shall cease; and the Sheriff or Bailiff shall cause him to be attached that ought to have ac.quitted him, that he appear upon the same Account, to do as Right shall require; and there shall have the Names of the Pledges.

Yet it is provided, that no Man of Religion, nor other, shall be distrained by his Beasts that gain his Land, nor by his Sheep, for the KingÕs Debt, nor the Debt of any other Man, nor for any other Cause, by the King's [or other BailiffsÕ] [but until they can find another Distress,4] or Chattels sufficient whereof they may levy the Debt, or that is sufficient for the Demand ; except impounding of Beasts that a Man findeth in his Ground damage-feasant, (Õ) after the Use and Custom of the Realm. And that such Distresses be reasonable, after the Value of the Debt or Demand, [and by the Esti.mation of Neighbours, and not by Strangers,"] and not outrageous.

Howbeit, the King willeth and commandeth, that Sheriffs or their Bailiffs, that have received the KingÕs Debt of the Summons of the Exchequer, and have not acquitted the Debtors thereof at [the Õ] next Account, shall be punished after [the Statutes made'0] thereupon.

And the King willeth, that all Debts of Summons of the Exchequer, that the Sheriff or Bailiff have confessed Receipt, shall be allowed him forthwith : so that whether he received all the Debt, or part, it shall never come more in [Demand nor] Summons, after the Sheriff hath confessed the Receipt.

And that the Constable, Marshal, [Chamberlain;"] and other that are of Fee in the Exchequer, from henceforth shall present unto the King such as they [have11] put in their Places to do their Offices, [which must,J] be of good Fame, and sufficient ('") for whose a£ls themselves will answer.

And the King commandeth the Treasurer, and Barons [of the Exchequer,] upon their Allegiance, and by the Oath that they have made to him, that they shall not [assign any in their Rooms, but such as this Act meaneth of.1Õ]

And Forasmuch as Sheriffs, Constables, and other obtain many Times outrageous Allowances, by [pre.tence of'3] the KingÕs Works, and other Things done and provided by his Commandment; It is provided, that all Surveyors of the KingÕs Works shall be chosen by the Oath of [Twelve'4] Men, and of such as [will and may attend best ,s] to that Office ; and that they be sufficient to answer the King, if need be, and shall swear that they bear lawful Witness.

When a Quarter of Wheat is sold for iiis. or iiis. ivd. and a Quarter of Barley for xxd. or iis. and a Quarter of Oats for xvid. then Brewers in Cities ought and may well afford to sell Two Gallons of Beer or Ale for a Penny, and out of Cities to sell iii [or iv.] Gallons for a Penny. And when in a Town iii Gallons are sold for a Penny, out of a Town they ought and may sell four ; and this Assise ought to be holden through.out all England.

[4 And if a Baker or Brewer be convi&ed that they have not kept the foresaid Assises, the First, Second, and Third Time they shall be amerced, according to the Quantity of their Offence ; and that as often as a Baker shall offend in the Weight of a Farthing Loaf of Bread not above ijs. Weight, that then he be amerced as before is said ; but if he exceed ijs. then [is he to be set upon5] the Pillory without any Redemption of Money.

In like Manner shall it be done if he offend often.times and will not amend, then he shall suffer the Judg.ment of the Body, that is to say, the Pillory if he offend in the Weight of a Farthing Loaf under Two Shillings Weight as is aforesaid.

* This Title is from the Copy in Tottell's Magna Carta, See. 1556, where this is given as a Statute of 33 Edw. I. The Calculation there, asalio in the older Printed Copies and Translations, is much shorter than that in the Text. The following short Article, intituled, Ô Compositio Ulnarum k Perticarum, is inserted in MS. Cost. Claudius D. II. fo. 241 b. and in some of the Old Printed Copies: The Translation, is from RastallÕi Collection ; 1603.

Ordinatum est qd tria g'na ordei sicca & rotunda faciunt pollicem ; duodecim pollices faciunt pedein; tres pedes faciunt ulnam -, quinq, ulne et dimidia faciunt pticam ; & quadraginta ptice in Iongitudine, & quatuor in latitudine faciunt unum Acram.

It is Ordained that three Grains of Barley dry and round do make an Inch ; Twelve Inches make a Foot; Three Feet make a Yard} Five Yards and a Half make a Perch; and Forty Perches in Length and Four in Breadth make an Acre.

It is Provided and Ordained, That the Enquirers shall com.mand the Sheriff of the place, that he do cause to come at a certain day, and at a certain place, which shall be assigned him by the aforesaid Enquirers, all the Bailiffs within the Wapentakes, Hundreds, and Franchises, that are and have been Bailiffs or Beadles, if they be living, during the Time when P. de C. was the Coroner of our Lord the King in that County ; that is to say, all that are and have been Bailiffs or Beadles within the Precintt of the Bailiwick belonging to that Coroner, or without, if need be. And that they do also cause to come before them the Coroner concerning whom they take the Inquest, with all his Rolls of the whole Time of his being Coroner of our Lord the King, and all his Clerks who are living. And the Enquirers shall forthwith safely seal, with their Seals, all the Rolls of the aforesaid Coroner, and redeliver them to the Coroner, that he may have them ready when the Justices in Eyre shall come to sit in that County, or that the King shall otherwise ordain in the matter. And if the Coroner be dead, after the same Manner shall it be done to his Heir, for his FatherÕs Time j so that neither the Coroner nor his Heir, nor their Clerks may forge the Rolls against the coming of the Justices, nor otherwise do any thing, in what may respcCt the Crown, to the prejudice of the King and Damage of the People, and in Hindrance of any ManÕs Right, as they have heretofore done.

And then when they shall have made the Oath, every Bailiff of a Wapentake, Hundred, and Franchise shall be severally charged to bring before the Enquirers aforesaid, at a Day, in a Place certain, that shall be given him by them, the Names of all the Towns, Half-towns, and Hamlets within his Wapentake, Hundred, and Franchise, written in a Roll, and at the same Day and Place shall deliver them to the afore.said Enquirers: And afterwards the Enquirers shall charge the aforesaid Bailiffs to cause to come before them, at a certain Day and Place which they shall appoint, from each Town eight Men, from an Half-town six Men, and from an Hamlet four, of the best and most lawful Men, except the Lords of such Towns, Half-towns, and Hamlets aforesaid, by whom the aforesaid Enquirers shall take the grand Inquest of twelve, of each Wapentake, Hundred, and Franchise, and Town answering by twelve, if there be any in the Precindf aforesaid ; and every one of the aforesaid eight, six, and four

STATUTE concerning the SHERIFF and his CLERKS.

'C'ORASMUCH as the Punishment of every Offence ought in justice to be inflifted upon the Person delinquent; and many Sheriffs in the Realm be wholly Lay Persons, having no Knowledge of the Returns of the Writs which hitherto are returnable into the KingÕs Court, and some, although they be lettered Persons, yet nevertheless putting so much Faith in the Afts of their Clerks, affeft not themselves in any way to intermeddle in the overlooking or examining of Writs direfted to them ; and always, in Times past, as well in the Exchequer as elsewhere, in the King's Courts it was the Usage, that for the undue Execution of Writs the Sheriffs to whom they were direfted, should be amerced, and not their Clerks who com.posed and made talse feigned and frivolous Answers to the same Writs ; whereby it is presumed and known to be true that those Clerks have assumed a greater boldness in offending: The Venerable Fathers, Brother William de Hotham Arch.bishop of Dublin, W. deLuda Bishop of Ely, R. de Gravesend Bishop of London, W. de Langton Bishop of CoveAtry and Litchfield, Treasurer of the King, and John de Langton Chancellor of England, John de Cobham and his Companions, Barons of the aforesaid Exchequer, and also the Justices of both Benches, and others of the KingÕs Council, being as.sembled at the same Exchequer at Westminster, on Friday, in the Feast of St. Valentine, in the Twenty-sixth Year of King Edward, consulting upon the applying of a Remedy in the aforesaid Case, lest for the future the Clerks of Sheriffs giving false Answers to the KingÕs Writs should perceive such their Malice to pass unpunished, as they have hitherto done, and lest Sheriffs also should not receive Punishment in that case for the Afts of their Clerks, and should permit them as before hath fre.quently happened ; They have agreed and provided, that before theTreasurer and Barons of the KingÕs Exchequer, and elsewhere in the Courts of the King himself before any of his Justices, as well the Clerks as the Sheriffs themselves shall answer for false Return, and be punished ; so that if a Deleft of Return be found in the Person of the Clerk, and not in the Person of the Sheriff, the Clerk shall make Satisfaftion to the Party injured of the Damage, which that Party can lawfully shew he hath sustained, in consequence of the Defeft of the Return afore.said, and nevertheless shall be punished as relates to the King, according to the Discretion of the Justices before whom he was convifted, Respeft being had to the Quantity of the Offence; And the Sheriffs then in that Case shall go quit; so nevertheless that their Clerks be sufficient to make Satisfac.tion as is said; to which if they be not, in their Default, Answer and Satisfaftion shall be made by the Sheriffs under whom those Clerks are bound to do such Duty.

And Be it Remembered that this Provision holdeth from thcDay of its being made, to be observed of the Sheriffs and their Clerks in London and Middlesex, and this because they are forewarned of the same. And as to the other Sheriffs of the Realm, and their Clerks, the said Provision shall hold Place on the Morrow of the Close of Easter next following, thenceforward, because then the said Sheriffs will be warned upon their Profer.

And afterwards on the Morrow of the Close of Easter in the Twenty-sixth Year of the Reign of the King, the said Provision was set forth in the Exchequer to the several Sheriffs of England; and it was agreed then by the KingÕs Council, that the Clerks of Sheriffs giving false Answers to the Summonses of the Ex.chequer upon the Accounts of the Sheriffs shall be punished, if they be thereof convifted, in the Form whereby it is above provided that they shall be punished, for the false Execution of Writs.

WHEN the Writ original is delivered in presence of the Parties before Justices, a Pleader shall say this, Sir Justice, [Conge de accorder and the Justice shall say to him, [what saith Sir R.*J and shall name one of the Parties; Then, when they be agreed of the Sum of Money that must be given to the King, then the Justice shall say, Cry the Peace ; and after, the Pleader shall say ; In so much as (Õ) Peace is licensed thus unto you, W. S. and A. his Wife, that here be, do acknow.ledge the Manor of B. with the Appurtenances contained in the Writ, to be the Right of [our Lord the King,4] which he hath of their Gift, to have and to hold to him and his Jieirs, of the said W. and A. and the Heirs of A. as in [Demeans,5] Rents, Seigniories, Courts, Pleas, Purchases, Wards, Marriages, Reliefs, Escheats, Mills, Advowsons of Churches, and all other Franchises and free Customs to the said Manor belonging, paying yearly to R. and his Heirs, as chief Lords of the Fee, the Ser.vices [and Customs due *] for all Services.

And it is to be noted, that the order of the Law will not suffer a final Accord to be levied in the KingÕs Court without a Writ original, and that must be at the least before Four Justices in the Bench, or in Eyre, and not otherwise, and in Presence of the Parties named in the Writ which must be of full Age, of good Memory, and out of Prison.

And if a Woman Covert be one of the Parties, then she must be first examined by Four of the said Justices ; and if she doth not assent thereunto, the Fine shall not be levied.

And the Cause wherefore such Solemnity ought to be done in a Fine, is, because a Fine is so high a Bar, of so great Force, and of so strong Nature in itself, that it concludeth not only such as be Parties and Privies thereto, and their Heirs, but all other People of the World, being of full Age, out of Prison, of good Memory, and within the Four Seas, the Day of the Fine levied ; if they make not their Claim of their Aftion within a Year and a Day [by the Country.7]

rr^HE King unto the Justices of his Bench, Greeting.

X Whereas of late We have ordained, that all such Vines as are to be levied in our Court, be lawfully levied, which We will in nowise to be infringed, (') or to be adnulled of their whole Power, We have sent unto you our Mind in writing firmly to be observed ; that is to wit, that as well the Parties Demandant or Plaintiff, as the Tenants or Defendants that will yield or acknowledge their Right [of Lands Ò] or Tenements unto other, in Pleas of Warrantia Chartae, Covenant, and other, whereupon Fines are to be levied afore you, before such Fines do pass, the Parties shall appear per.sonally, so that their Age, Idiocy, or any other Default, if any be, may be judged and discerned by you. Pro.vided notwithstanding, that if any Person be by Age or Impotence decrepid, or by [casualty J] so oppressed and withholden, that by no Mean he is able to come before you in our Court, then in such Case We will that Two or One of you, by Assent of the Residue of the Bench, shall go unto the Party so diseased, and shall receive his Cognizance upon that Plea and Form of Plea that he hath in our Court, whereupon the same Fine ought to be levied (*); and if there go but one he shall take with him an Abbot, a Prior, or a Knight, a Man of good Fame and Credit; and shall certify you thereof by [the !] Record, so that all Things incident to the same Fine being examined by him or them, the same Fines according to our former Ordinance may be lawfully levied.

And We will not that any of our Barons of the Exchequer, or (6) our Justices shall admit any At- tomies but only in Pleas that pass afore them (7) in the Benches and in Places where they be assigned by Us. And the same Power of admitting Attor.nies, we prohibit and deny to the Clerks and Servants of the said Barons and Justices; and do ordain that if any Attornies be admitted hereafter by any of the Persons aforesaid, their Admission shall be of none EffecI: Reserved alway to the Chancellor for the Time being his Authority in admitting Attornies, according to whose Discretion they shall be admitted j and to our Chief Justices as heretofore hath been observed in the Admission of Attornies.

We will also that this our Ordinance shall take Effeff and begin at the Utas of the Trinity next ensuing. [Given at our Parliament at Carlisle the Fifteenth Year of our Reign."]

THERE it is contained in our Statute that none of

v T our Court shall take any Plea to Champerty by Craft nor by Engine; and [that no1 ] Pleaders, Appren.tices, Attomies, Stewards of Great Men, Bailiffs, [nor any *] other of the Realm, [shall take for Maintenance or the like Bargain, any manner of Suit 01 Plea against other,1] whereby all the Realm is much grieved, and both Rich and Poor troubled in divers manners; It is Provided by a common Accord, That all such as from henceforth shall be attainted of such Emprises, Suits, or Bargains, and such as consent thereunto, shall have Imprisonment of Three Years, and shall make Fine at the KingÕs Pleasure. Given at Berwick upon Tweed the Twentieth Year of the Reign of King Edward (4).

Our Lord the King, at the Information of Gilbert Rowbery Clerk of his Council, hath commanded, That whosoever will complain himself of Conspirators, (') Inventors and Maintainors of false Quarrels, [and Par.takers thereof,6] and Brokers of Debates, that [Gil.bert Thornton shall cause them to be attached by his Writ, that they be before our Sovereign Lord the King, to answer unto the Plaintiffs by this Writ following :7]

The King to the Sheriff Greeting, We command thee, That if A. of B. give thee Surety for prosecuting his Claim, then put by Gages and safe Pledges G of C that he be before us from the Day of the Holy Trinity in Fifteen Days, wherever We shall then be in England, to answer to the aforesaid A. of a Pica of Conspiracy and Trespass according to our Ordi.nance lately thereof provided, as the said A. can reasonably show that he ought to answer to him thereof. And have there the Names of the Pledges and this Writ. Witness G. de Thornton.

And if any Man shall be convicted at the Suit of any Complainant of any such Offence, let him be impri.soned until he hath satisfied the Party grieved, and towards the King let him be grievously redeemed.

¥ In all the English Editions, as also in all Printed Copies where both Text and Translation are inserted, this has been printed as one Statute of 33 Edw. I. under the Title of 4 The Statute of ChampertyÕ. In the oldest Printed Copies by Pynson and Berthelet, the first Part is given at a separate Instrument, intituled, 4 Statutum de Champertie Õ and dated at Berwick, 11 Edw. 1. In those old Printed Copies is also inserted, an Instrument, intituled, * Statutum de ConspiratoribusÕ as of

33 Edw. I. in which the Statute of Champerty is again erroneously printed with some verbal Variations, with the Date

20 Edw. I. and the Provision and Writ against Conspirators is subjoined. In TottellÕs Printed Copy, 1536, the Ô Statutum

de Champertie Õ and 4 Statutum de Conspiratoribus Õ are given as separate Articles i the former with the Date 11 Edward I.

and the latter without a Date. In CayÕs Edition, a Copy of the first Part is given from MS. Colt. Claud. D. II. [fo. 163. where it is inserted, without any Title, immediately after the Statute of Gloucester, which is marked ÒexÕ p rotulu.Ó} In a Manuscript marked M. m. v. ly. in Cambridge University Library is a Copy of this first Pan, immediately after the Statute of Gloucester, which in that Manuscript is also marked as examined by the Roll: This Copy agrees with that in MS.

EDWARD by the Grace of God, &c. To all his true and faithful Subje&s, Greeting. Forasmuch as many do purchase the Protection of our Lord the King, affirming that they were out of the Realm in the KingÕs Service; (') It is Provided, That if their Adver- saty will challenge the Protection, and immediately when it is shewed in the Court, will aver (Õ) that they were within the Four Seas, and out of the KingÕs Service in a Place certain, so that they might have well come, their Challenge shall be entered (J), and the Matter shall remain without Day, according to the Nature of the Protection. And when [it shall be resummoned 4] and he cometh into the Court, he shall demand Judgement, and hearing of the Process, and offer to aver his Chal.lenge if his Adversary will attend : And if the Country do pass against him that cast the Protection, it shall [return to5] a Default, if he be Tenant; and if he be Demandant, he shall leese his Writ, and shall be amerced unto the King.

The Manner of challenging Essoins.

HERE is declared how many ways Essoins may be challenged, and in what Cases Essoins do lie, and in what not; that is to say, an Essoin lieth not where the Land is taken into the KingÕs Hands. Essoin lieth not where the Party is distrained by his Land (Ô). Essoin lieth not where any Judgement is given thereupon ; if the Jurors do come. Essoin lieth not where the Party was seen in the Court. Essoin of Ultra mare lieth not where another time the Party hath been essoined De malo veniendi. It lieth not where the Party hath essoined himself another Day It lieth not where the Sheriff was commanded to make the Party to appear. Essoin De servitio Regis lieth not where the Party is a Woman; unless because she be Nurse, a Midwife, or commanded by Writ Ad ventrem inspiciendum. It lieth not in a Writ of Dower, because it seemeth to be but a Deceit and a delay of Right [. It lieth not for that the Plaintiff hath not foundÕ] Pledges to prosecute the Suit. It lieth not where the Attorney was essoined. It lieth not where the Party hath an Attorney in his Suit. It lieth not where the Essoiner confessetn that he is not in our Lord the KingÕs Service. It lieth not where the Summons is not returned, or the Party not attached, for

RATTLE nor the Grand Assise may not be joined between Relations, until after the Third Degree, where they claim by the same Descent: But Battle may be joined between Brothers where one is a Feoffee, and the other claims by Descent of Inheritance. Battle is joined, and the Grand Assise not, where one is enfeoffed and vouches to Warranty under the Charter which he hath of his Feoffor, the Vouchee may deny the Charter by the Body of one his Freemen } and there the Grand Assise lieth not, but Battle. The Grand Assise is joined and Battle not, where a Man selleth Land to another by Charter, and such Purchaser selleth over the Land, and hath no more Land, whereby he gives up the Charter by which he was first enfeoffed; then cometh the Heir of riic first Feoffor and empleadeth him by Writ of Right, he cannot defend his Seisin by the Body of one of his Freemen ; but he must put himself on God and the Grand Assise. Neither Battle nor Grand Assise may be joined where the Demandant claims to hold in free Marriage, free Burgage, or in free Socage, and in Gavclkynd, as in Kent; and in other Cases, as if he demand only a small Thing as an Acre, Toft, or Croft ; then by Award of the Justices he may consent to a Jury of Twelve Free Men in place of the Grand Assise, to spare the Trouble and Oath of Twelve Knights; and they shall make the Oath without Delay, to say the Truth thereof to their Knowledge.

STATUTES concerning MONEY,

Made at Caernarvon, on the Feast of St. Michael, in the Twelfth Year.

AGAINST the Perils and Damages which are of late come, and which hereafter may come of the Money of England, It is thus ordained ; that it be cried and defended on the KingÕs Behalf thorough the whole Realm, in all the Merchant Towns, that no Man upon grievous Forfeiture be so hardy to dispend, receive, or send Money of other Coin than of the Coin of the King of England, Ireland, and Scotland.

Also that it be defended of the KingÕs Behalf, that none bring Money into this Country, but only for his Expences; neither that he be so hardy to arrive into England, if the Force of Tempest do not enforce him, by good witness, but at Dover, or at Sandwich, at London, and at St. Botolph, and at Southampton, and to other common Ports.

And when he shall come to any of these Places, he shall well and lawfully shew his Money to him that shall be assigned by the King, without any Concealment, upon Pain of Forfeiture of his Body, and that which he hath ; and that from thence he carry not nor eloin the same by himself nor by other, until that his Money be viewed and examined by him whom the King shall assign.

And Further, that it be cried and defended on the KingÕs Behalf, upon Pain of Forfeiture of his Body and that which he hath, that no Man be so hardy to send Money between Cloths, in Fardels, or in Bales, or in any other Manner whereof Suspicion may be of any Concealment. And if there be any such found, he which found the same shall have iiij d. of the Pound, and the rest to be to the King.

And also that it be cried and commanded on the KingÕs Behalf, that if any find Money coined of any other Coin than of the Coin of the King of England, Ireland, or Scotland, or [rounded1] Money, that he break the same; and that none be so hardy to gainsay the same upon Pain of grievous Forfeiture; and he which findeth the same false shall break the same, (Õ) the broken Money shall be given to him who oweth it, and the false Money shall be pierced without restoring it; and the Body of him in whose Hands the false or clipped Money appeareth to be found, be taken and holden until such Time as he can find Surety, if he be a suspicious Man.

And because that many of the Poor and Rich People cannot know the light and clipped Money (!), now it is ordained, that hereafter he which ought to receive or pay Money, shall receive and pay the same by Weight of v.s. of even Weight by the Tumbrel, delivered by the Warden of the Exchange marked with the KingÕs Mark as the Measures are ; and it shall be lawful to any Man to pierce the Money which shall not [weigh4 j the

* In the Printed Copies Three Instruments are inserted, and attributed to jo Edw. I. intituled, Ô Statutum de Moneta magnum.Õ Ç Statutum de Moneta Parvum.Õ Ô Articuli de Moneta.Õ The Statute printed in the Text from Lib. Scacc. unites the Contents of the First and Third of these Instruments. The Various Readings marked Rot. Pat. are from an Entry on the Patent Roll 12 Edw. I. m. 5. in Cedula, of a Writ to the Keeper of the Fair of St. Botulph, * DÕ quibjda remediis pvisis cont* retonS & falsificaSem Monete.Õ This Writ recites that the Inconveniencies arising from false Money, and the Remedies provided bv the King and Council, are sent them in a Schedule annexed, to be observed. The Copy of this Schedule begins with the Articuli de Moneta, 1 Ceosont les choses,' 8cc. and then proceeds to state the proposed remedy nearly in the tenor of part of the Statutum de Moneta magnum, as printed in the first six paragraphs of the Text. The Writ printed, post pa. 220, from Rot. Claus. 12 Edw.II. to the Treasurer ana Barons of the Exchequer appears to be the Foundation of the Statutum de Moneta parvum, as inserted in the Printed Copies, of which the Various Readings are given in the Notes. In MS. Cott. Claudius D. II. fo. 239, b. is the first part of this Statute, intituled ' Statutu de Moneta :Õ and in fo. 240 the latter part, intituled, Ô Articuli ejusdem Statuti.Õ These were printed in Cay's Edition.

The Viewer and the Warden of the Money which shall come from beyond the Sea, when he shall have any, he shall have regard unto the Age thereof, and shall weigh the same. And if he find of the new Money, that the Pound weigheth not xx s. by the Number of iiij pence, then he shall have regard by the Tumbrel where the Default shall be, (*) and if [he seeÕ] Money which is much used, if in the whole Pound of xxs. it want but vjd. then it shall be delivered to him who brought the same without gainsaying ; and if it want more, it shall be done of them, as of the rest. And let the Warden aforesaid take good heed, that he take no Gift nor Allowance, [to make any Means of Sport,5] nor make any Extortion, nor give any Manner of Delay, as he will save himself and his Goods.

These be the Things which arise on this side of the Sea and on the other, to the great Damage of our Lord the King and of his People, to the great Corruption of his Money of England.

First, they make there abroad a Money of Silver, with a Mitre; Twenty Shillings of which Money weighs only Six.teen Shillings and Four-pence of the Money of England.

Also they make Two other Sorts of Money with Lions, whereon there are bends in the one Money, and not in the other, but which are as light as the Money with the Mitre.

Also they make as well on this Side the Sea as on the other a Sort of false Money, which is merely of Copper,and is whitened, and when it is new it resembles the Money of England.

There is also another Sort of Money which is made in Germany under the Name of Edward King of England, which weighs as little as, or less than, the Money with the Mitre, and that cannot be distinguished, unless it be by Weight.

The other Deceit which they make in the Money is, that there are some who bring Plates of Pewter or of Lead in the Form of a Penny, then they put them between Two Leaves of Silver, and afterwards insert them into Coin or into Copper, where another Penny well forged hath been struck.

Others, as well on this side the Sea as on the other, do clip the good and lawful Money to the Damage of the wholeCommunity. Those Monies which are made and clipped out of England are brought by Passengers, and especially by Merchants. And because they know that Search is made for them at Dover, they put them into Cloths and Bales; then they come not to Dover or Sandwich, but they come to London, or into Essex, or into Suffolk, or into Norfolk, or to Hull, or into Lindsay, or to some other Ports of England, where they exped to find no Hindrance: The which 'Things, if they should be long permitted to be so, would bring the Money of England to nothing.

[And if you do not fully execute this our Commandment, We will grievously amerce you and yours. T. W. of Marchia, our Treasurer the xxj Day of June, in the Twentieth Year of our Reign.6]

1 The King to his Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer,

STATUTE concerning Tenants by the Curtesy of England.

Who shall be Tenant by the Curtesy ;

who not.

No Homage for Land given in Marriage.

A Second Husband.

J HEN a Man shall take Lands in Marriage with a Wife, if he have begotten of the same his Wife an Heir, Son, or Daughter, which shall be heard to cry within the Four Walls, if the same Husband over.live his Wife, whether the Heir live or not, the same Land shall remain to the Husband, (') and after the Death of the Husband, the Lands shall return to the Donor or to his Heir; but if he have no Heir by his Wife, then after the Death of the Wife, it shall return to the Donor or to his Heir. And this is the Cause why for Land given in Marriage, Homage is not used to be received; for if any Lands were so given in Mar.riage or otherwise that Homage were received, it might then never lawfully revert to the Donor or to his Heir as above is said. And the same Judgement shall be of the Second Husband, as is said of the First, whether there be left any Heir of the First or not.

TT'ORASMUCH as We have understood very often that Contention hath arisen between Parsons of Churches and their Parishioners, touching Trees that grow in the Churchyard, both of them affirming that they belong to themselves; We have thought good to to declare the doubt of such Contentions [by law of Writing'] rather than by law of Statute : For whereas Tim in a the Churchyard, specially that which is dedicated, is the Churchjrnrd Soil of the Church, and whatsoever is planted upon the *

Soil belongeth to the Soil, it followeth necessarily, that u the Trees themselves ought to be numbered amongst the Church Goods, the disposing whereof is not given to Laymen, but, as the Holy Scripture witnesseth, the care of disposing them being undiscussed by God, ought to be committed unto Priests only: But, Foras.much as those Trees oftentimes are planted to keep away the Force of the Wind for hurting of the Churches, We will that the Parsons of Churches do Theyihitt do not presume to fell those Trees undiscreetly, but be uied in only when the Chancel of the Church doth want ne- ,he

cessary Reparations; nor shall convert them to any urc ' other Use by any other means, unless the Body of the Church do likewise want Reparations, and the Parsons do of Charity think good to give of those Trees to the Parishioners wanting them ; which We do not command to be done, but when it is done we do commend it.

The STATUS) of JEWRY.

FORASMUCH as the King hath seen that divers Evils, Usury

and the disheriting of the good Men of his Land have forbidden to happened by the Usuries which the Jews have made in Time lh* Jews, past, and that divers Sins have followed thereupon ; albeit he and his Ancestors have received much benefit from the Jewish People in all Time past; nevertheless for the Honour of God and the common benefit of the People, the King hath ordained and established, That from henceforth no Jew shall lend any Thing at Usury, either upon Land, or upon Rent, or upon other Thing: And that no Usuries shall run in Time coming from the Feast of Saint Edward last past. Notwithstanding, the Covenants before made shall be observed, saving that the Usuries shall cease. But all those who owe Debts to Jews upon Pledges of Moveables, shall acquit them between this and Easter; if not they shall be forfeited. And if any Jew shall lend at Usury contrary to this Ordinance, the King will not lend his Aid, neither by himself nor his Officers, for the recovering of his Loan ; but will punish him at his discretion for the Offence, and will do justice to the Christian that he may obtain his Pledge again.

AND that the Distresses for Debts due onto the Jews from Distresses henceforth shall not be so grievous, but that, the Moiety of for Debts the Lands and Chattels of the Christians shall remain for their to ^ewÕ* Maintenance ; and that no Distress shall be made for a Jewry Debt, upon the Heir of the Debtor named in the JewÕs Deed, nor upon any other Person holding (he Land that was the DebtorÕs, before that the Debt be put in Suit and allowed in Court.

And if the Sheriff or other Bailiff, by the KingÕs Command hath to give Seisin to a Jew, be it one or more, for their Debt, of Chattels or Land to the Value of the Debt, the Chattels shall be valued by the Oaths of good Men, and be delivered to the Jew or Jews, or to their Proxy, to the Amount of the Debt; and if the Chattels be not sufficient, the Lands shall be extended by the same Oath before the Delivery of Seisin to the Jew or Jews, to each in his due Proportion; so that it may be certainly known that the Debt is quit, and the Christian may have his Land again : Saving always to the Christian the Moiety of his Land and Chattels for his mainte.nance as aforesaid, and the Chief Mansion.

And if any Moveables hereafter be found in Possession of a Jew, and any Man shall sue him, the Jew shall be allowed his Warranty, if he may have it; and if not, let him answer therefore: So that he be not herein otherwise privi.leged than a Christian.

AND that all Jews shall dwell in the KingÕs own Cities and Boroughs, where the Chests of Chirographs of Jewry are wont to be : And that each Jew after he shall be Seven Yeats old, shall wear a Badge on his outer Garment; that is to say, in the Form of Two Tables joined, of yellow Felt, of the Length of Six Inches, and of the Breadth of Three Inches. And that each one, after he shall be Twelve Years old, pay Three pence yearly at Easter of Tax to the King, whose Bond-man he is; and this shall hold place as well for a Woman as a Man.

And that no Jew shall have Power to infeoff another, whether Jew or Christian, of Houses, Rents, or Tenements that he now hath, nor to alien in any other Manner, nor to make Acquittance to any Christian of his Debt, without the especial Licence of the King, until the King shall have other.wise ordained therein.

AND, Forasmuch as it is the will and sufferance of Holy Church, that they may live and be preserved, the King taketh them under his Protection, and granteth them his Peace ; and willeth that they be safely preserved and defended by his Sheriffs and other Bailiffs, and by his Liege Men; and com- mandeth that none shall do them harm, or damage, or wrong, in their Bodies or in their Goods, moveable or immoveable ; and that they shall neither plead nor be impleaded in any Court, nor be challenged or troubled in any Court, except in the Court of the King, whose Bond-men they are. And that none shall owe Obedience, or Service, or Rent, except to the King, or his Bailiffs in his Name ; unless it be for their Dwellings which they now hold by paying Rent; saving the Right of Holy Church.

AND the King granteth unto them that they may gain their living by lawful Merchandise and their Labour; and that they may have Intercourse with Christians, in order to carry on lawful Trade by selling and buying. But that no Chris- tian, for this Cause or any other, shall dwell among them. And the King willeth that they shall not by reason of their Merchandise be put to Lot or Scot, nor in Taxes with the Men of the Cities or Boroughs where they abide ; for that they are taxable to the King as his Bondmen, and to none other but the King.

Moreover the King granteth unto them that they may buy Houses and Curtilages, in the Cities and Boroughs where they abide, so that they hold them in chief of the King ; saving unto the Lords of the Fee their Services due and accustomed. And that they may take and buy Farms or Land for the Term of Ten Years or less, without taking Homages or Fealties, or such sort of Obedience from Christians, and without having Advowsons of Churches ; and that they may be able to gain their living in the World, if they have not the Means of Trading, or cannot Labour; and this Licence to take Lands to farm shall endure to them only for Fifteen Years from this Time forward.

IT is Provided by our Lord the King and his Justices, and also granted unto (1) the Citizens of London, That (*) Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Ba.rons, and other that have Rents in London, and for some Tenements the Rents are behind, and (J) cannot recover those Rents, that it shall be lawful for them to distrain their Tenants for their Arrerages, so long as any Thing is found in the Fee, whereby they may be distrained; and if they have nothing in the Fee, whereby they may be distrained, then the Tenants shall be im.pleaded [by a Writ of Gavelet ¥] of Customs and Ser.vices, which may be well done by the Freemen of their City presented in their Hustings, for the keeping of Suit, to gather their Rents; so that if the Tenants do acknowledge their Services, they shall presently and without Delay satisfy their Lords of their Arrerages. And if they deny them their Services, the Demandants shall immediately name (!)two Witnesses, whose Names shall be inrolled, and shall have Day to bring them forth at the next Hustings; at which Day if they bring forth (6) Witnesses, and it is shewed by them in the full Court of their own Sight and Hearing, that the same Plaintiffs have any Time received the Rents which they demand of the Tenements, then the Tenants shall leese their Fees by Award of the Court, and the Plaintiffs shall recover their Tenements in Demean. [If they will not7] acknowledge the Services unto their Lords, as before is said, and likewise the Arrerages, then the Arrerages by Judgement of the Court shall be doubled, and they shall give to the Sheriff for the wrongful with.holding, [if they be worth so much, C. s. without any Difficulty:s] And if they do not come in after due Summons in the Hustings, then the same Fees shall be delivered unto the Plaintiffs in the full Hustings, to be holden in their own Hands for one Year and a Day ; within which Time if the Tenants do coine unto them, and do offer to satisfy them of the Arrerages double, and to the Sheriff for his Amerciament, as before is said, then they shall have their Tenements again; but if [it be9] after one Year and a Day accomplished, such Tenements shall remain unto the Lords of those Fees, by Judgement of the Court, in their Demean for ever; and then such Lands shall be called Forschoke, because such Tenements shall remain for ever in Demean to the Lords of the Fees, for Default of the Service. The same Ordinance shall be kept and observed if the Tenants do knowledge the Arrerages, and be not able to make Satisfaction therefore, as it is said before.

The CUSTOMS of KENT.

^iOHESE are the Usage* and Customs, the which the Comunalty of Kent claimeth to have in the Tenements of Gavelkinde, and in the Men of Gavel- kinde, allowed in Eire before John of Berwike, and his Companions, the Justices in Eire in Kent, the Twenty- first Year of King Edward, the Son of King Henry ; that is to say, that all the Bodies of Kentishmen be free, as well as the other free Bodies of England. And that they ought not the Eschetor of the King to chuse, nor ever in any Time did they: But the King shall take, or cause to be taken, such an one as it shall please him, to serve him in that which shall be needful. And that they may their Lands and their Tenements give and sell, without Licence asked of their Lords: Saving unto the Lords the Rents and the Services due out of the same Tenements. And that all and every of them may, by Writ of the King, or by Plaint, plead for the obtaining of their Right, as well of their Lords as of other Men. And they claim also, that the communahie of Gavel- kindmen, which hold none other than Tenements of Gavelkinde nature, ought not to come to the common Summonce of the Eire, but only by the Borsholder, and Four Men of the Borough ; except the Towns, which ought to answer by Twelve Men in the Eire. And they claim also, that if any Tenant in Gavelkinde be attainted of Felony, for the which he suffereth Ex.ecution of Death, the King shall have all his Goods, and his Heir forthwith after his Death shall be inherit.able to all his Lands and Tenements which he held in Gavelkinde in Fee, and in Inheritance; and he shall hold them by the same Services and Customs as his Ancestors held them ; whereupon it is said in Kentish, Ô the Father to the Boughe, and the Sonne to the Plough.Õ And if he have a Wife, forthwith be she endowed by the Heir, if he be of Age, of the one half of all the Lands and Tenements which her Husband held of Gavelkinde nature in Fee; to have and to hold according to the Form hereafter declared. And of such Lands the King shall not have the Year, nor Wast, but only the Goods, as is before said. And if any Man of Gavelkind, either for Felony or for Suspicion

(a) And they claim also, that if any Te- nant in Gavelkinde die, and be an Inheritour of Lands plrtjbie. and Tenements in Gavelkinde, that all his Sons shall part that Inheritance by equal Portions. And if there be no Heir Male, let the Partition be made between the Females, even as between Brothers. And let the Mes- The Hearth suage also be departed between them, but the Hearth t0 the for Fire shall remain to the youngest Son or Daughter; youngeÈt. and be the Value thereof delivered to each of the Par.ceners of that Heritage, from xl. Feet from that Astre, if the Tenement will so suffer : And then let the eldest Brother have the first Choice, and the others afterward according to their Degree. Likewise of Houses which shall be found in such Messuages, let them be de.parted amongst the Heirs by equal Portions, that is to weete, by Foot if need be, saving the Covert of the Astre, which shall remain to the youngest Son or Daughter as is before said: So nevertheless that the youngest make reasonable Amends to his Parceners, for the Part which to them belongeth, by the Award of good Men : And of the aforesaid Tenements, whereof One Suit one only Suit was wont to be made before Time, be parccncrl; there not by reason of the Partition but one sole Suit made, as it was before accustomed: But yet let all the Contribution Parceners make Contribution to the Parcener which ,lÕcreon- maketh the Suit for them. In like Sort let the Goods Partition of Gavelkinde Persons be parted into Three Parts, after PÓ80"*'1' the Funerals and the Debts paid, if there be lawful deceased, issue on live: So that the Dead have one part, and his lawful Sons and Daughters another Part, and the Wife the Third Part. And if there be no lawful Issue on live, custody of let the Dead have the one Half and the Wife on live the ,tle Pj'!r other Half. And if the Heir or Heirs shall be under ^ * Õ

the Age of Fifteen Years, let the nourtriture of them be committed by the Lord to the next of the Blood to whom the Inheritance can not descend, So that the Lord take nothing for committing thereof; and let not the Marriage.

(a) Somner in his ÒTreatise of Gavelkind,Ó pa. 171, ( Edit.I 726.) gives the following Clause, with the Translation, to be inserted in this Place ; from an ancient Copy Ç registred in a quondam Book of St. Auguftine's Abbey at Canterbury," then in the Possession of Sir Roger Twysden.

E si home ou femme seit feloun de sei mesmes, qe il sey mesmes de gre se ocye, le Roy aura les chatteux tuts & nient 1* an ne le Wast, mes le heir seit tantost enherite sans contredit, kar tout seit il feloun de sey mesmes, il neyt my atteint de felonye.

And that this is one of the Customs of Kent,

And if a Man or Woman shall be a Felon of him or herself, who shall kill him or herself of his or her own accord, the King shall have all the Chattels, and not the Year and the Waste, but the Heir shall immediately inherit without Con.tradiction 5 for albeit he or she be a Felon of him or her sell, he or she is not attainted of Felony.

Proceedings upon the Custom of Gavelatc,

of the which Profits and Goods let him be bound to make answer which had the Education of the Heir, or else the Lord or his Heirs which committed the same Education : And this is to be understood that from such Time as those Heirs in Gavelkinde be of, or have passed, the Age of Fifteen Years, it is lawful for them, their Lands or Tenements, to give and sell at their Pleasure ; saving the Services to the chief Lords as is before said. And if any such Tenant in Gavelkinde die, and have a Wife that over liveth him, let that Wife by-and by be endowed of the the one Half of the Tenements whereof her Husband died vested and seized, by the Heirs, if they be of Age, or by the Lords if the Heirs be not of Age; so that she may have the one Half of those Lands and Tenements to hold so long as she keepeth her a Widow, [or shall be attainted of Childbirth,'] after the ancient Usage ; that is so say, that if when she is delivered of Child, the Infant be heard cry, and that the Hue and Cry be raised, and the Country be assembled, and have the View of the Child so bom, and of the Mother, then let her lose her Dower wholly, and otherwise not, so long as she holdeth her a Widow; whereof it is said in Kentish, Ò He that doth wende her, let him lende her.Ó And they claim also, that if a Man take a Wife which hath Inheritance of Gavelkinde, and the Wife dieth before him, let the Husband have the one Half of those Lands and Tenements whereof she died seised so long as he holdeth him a Widower, without doing any Strippc or Waste, or [Banishment,1] whether there were Issue between them or no: And if he take another Wife, let him lose all. And if any Tenement of Gavelkinde do Escheat, and that Escheat be to any Lord which holdeth by Fee of Hawberke, or by Ser- jeancie, by Death or by Gavelate as is hereafter said, or be to him rendred by his Tenant which before held it of him by quiteclaim thereof made, or if his Escheat be by Gavelate as is hereafter said, let this Land remain to the Heirs unpartable: And this is to be understood where the Tenant so rendering doth retain no Service to himself, but saveth nevertheless to the other Lords their Fees, Ferns, and the Rents wherewith the afore.said Tenements of Gavelkind, so rendred, were before charged, by him or them which might charge them. And they claim also, that if any Tenant in Gavelkinde withhold his Rent and his Services of the Tenement which he holdeth of his Lord, let the Lord seek by the Award of his Court [from Three Weeks to Three Weeks, to find3] some Distress |ipon that Tenement until the Fourth Court, always with Witnesses: And if within that Time he can find no Distress in that Tenement, whereby he may have Justice of his Tenant, then at the Fourth Court let it be awarded, that he shall take that Tenement into his Hand, in the Name of a Distress, as if it wete an Ox or a Cow, and let him keep it a Year and a Day in his Hand without manuring it; within which Term if the Tenant come

and pay his Arrerages, and make reasonable Amends for the withholding, then let him have and enjoy his Tenement, as his Ancestors and he before held it.

And if he do not come before the Year and the Day past, then let the Lord go to the next County Court with the Witnesses of his own Court, and pronounce there this Process to have further witness. And by the Award of his Court, after that County Court holden, he shall enter, and manure in those Lands and Te.nements, as in his own Demeans. And if the Tenant come afterward, and will re-have his Tenements, and hold them as he did before, let him make Agreement with the Lord, according as it is anciently said :

And they claim also, that every Essoini. Kentish Man may essoin another,, either in the KingÕs Court or in the County, or in the Hundred, or in the Court of his Lord, where Essoin lieth, and that as well in case of common Suit as of (Õ) Plea. Moreover they claim by an especial Deed of King Henry [the Third,

Father of King Edward which now is, whom God save,J ] that of the Tenements which are holden in Gavelkinde, there shall no Battail be joined, nor Grand N¡

J ^ nor Grand

Assise taken by Twelve Knights, as it is used in other Assise in Places of the Realm ; this is to weet, where the Tenant Lands, and Demandant hold by Gavelkinde: But in place of these Grand Assises, let Juries be taken by Twelve Men, being Tenants in Gavelkinde, so that Four Tenants of Gavelkinde choose Twelve Tenants of Gavelkinde to be Jurors. And the Charter of the King of this Espe.cially [is in4] the Custody of Sir John of Norwood, the Day of S. Alphey, in Canterbury, the Year of King Edward, the Son of King Henry, the Twenty-first.

These be the Usages of Gavelkinde, and of Gavelkinde- Men in Kent, which were before the Conquest, and at the Conquest, and ever since till now.

Ô That is. Let him nine Timet fay. and nine Timet repay the Arreart, and Five founds for the detention of the Rent, before he shall have hit Tenement again.

Of THE KINGÕS PREROGATIVE*

OUR Lord the King shall have the Ward of all the Lands of such as hold of him in chief by KnightÕs Service, whereof the Tenants were seised in their Demesne as of Fee, at the Day of their Death, of whomsoever they hold else by like Service, so that they held [of ancient Time any Land of the Crown,'] until the Heir come to his lawful Age ; except the Fees of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Durham be.tween Tyne and Tees, and Fees of Earls and Barons (') in the Marches, where the KingÕs Writs do not lie; and whereof the said Archbishops, Bishops, Earls, and Barons ought to have such Wards, though they held of the King in some other place.

Also the King shall have Marriage of an Heir being within Age and in his Ward, whether the Land of such Heir have appertained to the Crown of antient conti.nuance, or that it came by reason of Escheat being in the KingÕs Hands, or that he had the Marriage by reason of the Ward (J) of the Lords of such Heirs, without any respedl to the Priority of Feoffment, albeit they held of others.

Also the King shall have Primer Seisin, after the Death of such as held of him in Chief, of all Lands and Tenements whereof they were seised in their De.mesne as of Fee, of what Age that their Heirs be; taking the Issues of the same Lands and Tenements, until Inquisition be made as the Manner is, and until he hath taken Homage of such Heir.

Also he shall assign to Widows after the Death of their Husbands, that held of him i t Chief, the Dower that to them belongeth, [&c.] though the Heir be of full Age, if the Widows will: And such Widows, before Assignment of their Dower, shall swear that they shall not marry themselves without the KingÕs Licence, whether the Heirs be of full Age or not. And if they marry without (4) Licence, then the King shall take into his Hands by way of Distress all such Lands and Tenements as they hold of him in Dower, until he be satisfied at his own Will, so that [she5] shall take nothing of the Issues, &c. for by such Distresses they and their Husbands must fine at his Will: And his Will in the Time of King Henry, Father of King Edward, was esteemed to the one YearÕs Value of her Dower, unless they had the greater Favour.

Women that hold of the King in Chief any Inheritance, of whatsoever Age they be, shall swear likewise that they shall not marry themselves without the KingÕs Licence ; and if they do, their Lands and Tenements shall be taken in like Manner into the KingÕs Hands, until they have satisfied at the King's Will.

And if one Inheritance that is holden of the King in Chief, descend to many Parceners, then all the Heirs shall do Homage to the King ; and the same Inheritance so holden of the King shall be divided amongst those Heirs; so that every of them after shall hold their part of the King.

If a Woman, before the Death of her Ancestor that held of the King in chief, be married before she be mar.riageable, then the King shall have the Ward of the Body of the same Woman until she be of Age able to consent; and then she may chuse whether she will have him to whom she was first married, or him that the King will offer her.

Of Land* of

None that holdeth of the King in chief by Knight's Service, may alien the more part of his Lands, so that the Residue thereof be not sufficient to do his Service, except he have the KiugÕs Licence ; but this may not be understood of Members and Parcels of such Lands.

Of Serjeanties aliened without the King's Licence, the King hath used to rate such Serjeanties at a reasonable Extent thereof to be made.

Of Churches being vacant, the Advowsons whereof The King a belong to the King, and other present to the same, where- upon debate ariseth between the King and other: If the churcbea. King by Award of the Court do recover his Presen.tation, though it be after the lapse of Six Months from the Time of the Avoidance, no Time shall prejudice him, so that he present within the Space of Six Months.

The King shall have the Custody of the Lands of natural Fools, talcing the Profits of them without Waste or Destrudion, and shall find them their Necessaries, of whose Fee soever the Lands be holden ; and after the Death of such Idiots he shall render [if] to the right Heirs, so that such Idiots shall not aliene, nor their Heirs shall be disinherited.

Also the King shall provide, when any, that before- time hath had his Wit and Memory happen to foil of his Wit, as there are many [per lucida intervalla,1] that their Lands and Tenements shall be safely kept without Waste and Destru&ion, and that they and their Houshold shall live and be maintained competently with the Pro.fits of the same, and the Residue besides their Susten- tation shall be kept to their Use, to be delivered unto them when they come to right Mind ; so that 9uch Lands and Tenements shall in no wise (') be aliened; and the King shall take nothing (4) to his own Use. And if the Party die in such Estate, then the Residue shall be distributed for his Soul by the Advice of the Ordinary.

Also the King shall have Wreck of the Sea through.out the Realm, Whales and [great SturgeonsÕ] taken in the Sea or elsewhere within the Realm, except in certain Places privileged by the King.

Also the King shall have Escheats of the Lands of Normans, to whose Fee soever they belong, saving the Service appertaining to the chief Lords of the same Fee;

And this also is to be understood where any Inheritance descendeth to any that is born in the Parts beyond the Sea, whose Ancestors were from the Time of King John under the Allegiance of the Kings of France, and not of the Kings of England, as late it happened by the Barony of Monmouth, after the Death of John de Monmouth, whose Heirs were of Britain, and (*) other Places, King Henry by the foresaid Occasion recovered many Escheats of Normans Lands out of the Fees of other Men, and gave them to be holden of the chief Lords of the Fee, by Services due and accustomed thereunto.

When any that holdeth of the King in chief dieth, and his Heir entereth into the Land that his Ancestor held of the King the day that he died, before that he hath done Homage to the King, and received Seisin of the King, he shall gain no Freehold thereby ; and if he die seised during that Time, his Wife shall not be endowed of the same Land ; as it came in use by Maud, daughter to the Earl of Hereford, Wife to [Maunsel Õ] the Marshal, which after the Death of William Earl Marshal of Eng.land his Brother, took his Seisin of the Castle and Manor of Scrogoil, and died in the same Castle, before he had entered by the King, and before he had done Homage to him ; whereupon it was agreed that his Wife should not be endowed, because that her Husband had not entered by the King, but rather by Intrusion: how- beit [the Statute doth not meanÕ] of Socage and other small Tenures.

Also the King shall have Escheats of Lands of the Freeholders of Archbishops and Bishops, when such Tenants be attainted for Felony (Õ) in time of Vacation, while their Temporalties were in the KingÕs Hands, to give at his Pleasure, [saving to such Prelates the Ser.vice that thereto is due and accustomed.,c]

Wreck of the Sea, Whales and Sturgeons.

Escheats of Lands descended to Aliens.

Intrusion of the KingÕs Tenant befote Homage.

Escheats of Felons during the Vacancy of Gishopricks.

Const rufiion of Grants of Lands by the King.

The Linds and Goods of Felons attainted.

Customs of Gloucester and Kent.

When our Lord the King giveth or granteth Land or a Manor with the Appurtenances, without he make ex.press mention in his Deed or Writing of KnightÕs Fees, Advowsons of Churches, and Dowers when they fall, belonging to such Manor or Land, then at this Day the King reserveth to himself such Fees, Advowsons, and Dowers, albeit that among other Persons it hath been observed otherwise.

Also the King shall have the Goods of all Felons at.tainted, and Fugitives wheresoever they be found. And if they have Freehold, then it shall be forthwith taken into the KingÕs Hands, and the King shall have all Pro.fits of the same by one Year and one Day, and the Land shall be wasted and destroyed in the Houses, Woods, and Gardens, and in all manner of Things belonging to the same Land, excepting Men of certain Places pri.vileged by the King therefore. And after our Lord the King hath had the Year, Day, and Waste, then the Land shall be restored to the chief Lord of the same Fee, unless that he fine before with the King for the Year, the Day, and the Waste. Nevertheless it is used in the County of Gloucester by Custom, that after one Year and one Day, the Lands and Tenements of Felons shall revert and be restored to the next Heir, to whom [it'] ought to have descended if the Felony had not been done. And in Kent, in Gavelkind, Ò The Father to the Bough, the Son to the Plough,Ó (Ò) there all Heirs Male shall divide their Inheritance, and likewise Women ; but Women shall not make Partition with Men. And a Woman after the Death of her Husband shall be en.dowed of the Moiety; and if she commit Fornication in her Widowhood, or take an Husband after, she shall lose her (3) Dower.

Wards and Reliefs.

IT is to wit, that where any Relief is given, there Wardship is incident, and contrariwise; And such as hold by Serjeanty to go with the King in his Host, there Ward and Relief are incident; And such as hold by Petty Serjeanty, as to bear Shield or Spear in the KingÕs Host, or to bear or to carry, there is neither Ward, Marriage, or Relief; Also a free Sokeman shall not give Ward nor Relief, but he shall double his Rent after the Death of his Ancestor, according as he hath used to pay to his Lord, and shall not be unmeasurably grieved. Now somewhat is to be said of the Nature of having Wards; There be Two Manner of Writs to have Wards ; one is where Lands be holden in KnightÕs Service, the other is where Lands be holden in Socage; The Ward of Land that is holden in Knights Service belongeth to the Chief Lord, and the Marriage, which ought to be without Disparagement as the Great Char.ter limiteth, [until he cometh to the Age of1] One and twenty Years : The Ward of an Heir that holdeth in Socage; if the Land or Inheritance descend of his Mo.therÕs Side, then it belongeth to the next Friend on the FatherÕs Side; and contrariwise : And a Writ to recover Ward may be brought in Three Manners; One is when a Man demandeth Ward of the Land, and of the Heir, and that is in case when a Man holdeth Land of ano.ther by Knights Service, and the Tenant dieth, then may the Chief Lord, if he be deforced, demand the Ward of his Land and Heir, and shall have both Ward and Marriage. Another Manner is when a Man is infeoffed of a Verge of Land by one Man, and (Õ) by another of a Carve of Land, the Second Lord may not bring a Writ of Ward to recover either the Land or the Heir, for the Ward belongeth to him of whom he 1 was first infeoffed. The Third Manner is where a Man hath Land in his Hands by Reason of Ward, and [hath not the Heir,3] then he may bring a Writ to demand the Heir, and not the Land.

STATUTE for respiting of Knighthood.*

OUR Lord the King hath granted, That all such as ought to be Knights, and be not, and have been distrained to take upon them the Order of a Knight, within the Feast of the Nativity of our Lord, shall have respite to take the aforesaid Arms of a Knight, until the Utas of St. Hillary without [Occasion,1] and after that, that they shall be distrained ; [except they make some other Mean.1]

Also he hath granted, that if any will complain in the Chancery, because he was distrained, &c. and hath not Twenty Pound yearly in Fee, or for Term of Life, and will prove that by the Country, then it shall be written umo [the more3] discreet and sage Knights of the Shire to take the said Inquisition ; and if it be tried so by the same Inquest, he shall have Remedy, and the Distress shall cease.

Also if any be impleaded for all his Land, or for Part of the same, so that the Residue be not sufficient to the Value of Twenty Pound, and can prove the same, then the Distress shall cease until the same Plea be determined.

Also if any of them be bounden (4) in certain Debts stalled in the Exchequer, at a certain Sum to be received yearly out of his Lands, so that the Residue of his Lands doth not amount to the yearly Value of Twenty Pounds besides the same Sum, the Distress shall cease, until the foresaid Debt be clearly paid.

And none shall be distrained to take upon him the Order of a Knight, before that he come unto the Age of One and twenty Years.

Also none by Reason of any Land that he holdeth in Manors, which now are ancient Demean of the Crown as Sokeman, and [which Lands must also give3] Tal.lage when the KingÕs Demeans are tallied, shall be distrained to take upon him the Order of a Knight.

Also of them that hold their Land in Socage, of other Manors than of the (6) Manors of the Crown, doing no Foreign Service, the Rolls of the Chancery shall be searched for the Times of the KingÕs Predecessors, and it shall be done as it hath been used to be done.

In like Manner shall be done of Clerks being within Holy Orders, holding Lay-fee, which should be Knights if they were Lay.

Also none shall be distrained for his Burgage Lands, although they do amount to the Value of Twenty Pound yearly, or more.

And they that ought to be Knights, and be not, which have holden their Lands in their Hands but a small Time ; and likewise such as should be Knights, that do pretend great Age, or Default of their Members, or any other incurable Disease, or Charge of [their Children, or of Suits,7] or do alledge [such necessary Excuses,"] they shall resort unto Robert Tiptoft, and Anthony de Beck, and shall make Fine before them; to whom it is enjoyned, that according to their Dis.cretions they shall admit the reasonable Fines of all such Persons.

IF any Forester shall find any Man attachable for Attachments Green-hue in his Forest, first he shall attach him for Vert, by Two Pledges, if they be to be found, if not, he shall be brought to the next Town where they may be found.

And if [they be afterward Ô] found, he shall attach him

by Four Pledges. And if the Third Time, he shall be

presented before the Verdors, and be put by Eight

Pledges; afterward after the Third Attachment his

Body shall be attached and retained; [for a Remembrance

that he is a Verdor. Know !] that all Trees not bearing

Fruit, and those which bear Fruit at any Time in the

whole Year, and an Ash if he be old [shall remain in

the Forest, and Arable,Õ] because our Lord the King is

in Possession. If any Man shall be found felling an

Oak without the Demesne Wood, and within the Pre-

cin£t, without the View or Delivery of the Forester

or Verdor, he shall be attached by Four Pledges, and

by the View of the Verdor the Oak shall be appraised,

and the Names of the Pledges shall be written in the

Roll of the Foresters and Verdors. If any Man shall Assart, and

be found in the KingÕs Demesnes assarting or doing Purprcium.

Purpresture, his Body shall be forthwith retained; but

if without the Demesnes within the Precindl he shall be

put by Six Pledges; and if he be afterward found

he shall double his Pledges; if the T hird Time, [he

shall retain his Body.*] If any Man attachable do Sureties

refuse to put in Sureties and Pledges he shall be dis- by Parties

trained by his Cattels found within the Bounds of *>uchcd

the Forest; but if he have none, his Body shall be

detained until he have done that which he ought; and

If any Deer be found dead or wounded there shall be an Inquisition made by [Six' ] of the next Villages to the Forest which shall be written in the Roll; the Finder shall be put by Six Pledges and the Flesh shall be sent to a Spital House, if by Testimony of the Verdors and the Country there be any nigh ; but if there be no such House near, the Flesh shall be given to the Poor and Lame, the Head and Skin shall be given to the Poor of the next Town, and the Arrow, if there be any found, shall be presented to the Verdor, and inrolled in his Roll. If there be any Greyhounds found running to do any Hurt, the Foster shall retain them, and present them in the Presence of the Verdor, and send them to the King or Chief Justice of the Forest. If any Mastive be found upon any Deer and shall be [rnusled,1] he whose Mastive he is shall be quit of the Deed; but if he be not [rnusled *] the Owner of such Mastive shall be guilty, [as if he had given it him with his Hand,1] and he shall be put by Six Pledges, whose Names shall be written, and also what Dog it was. If any Man take Deer in the Forest without War.rant, his Body shall be arrested wheresoever he be found within the Bounds of the Forest; and when he is taken, he shall not be delivered without special Com.mandment of the King, or of the Chief Justice of the Forest. If any see any misdoers within the Bounds of the Forest, to take or carry away any Deer, he shall do what he may to take them, and if he cannot he shall levy Hue and Cry, and if he do not so he shall remain in the KingÕs Mercy. If any Woodward shall see Mis- deers within his Wardship, or shall see a dead Wild Beast, he shall shew him to the Chief Foster or Verdor, and if he do not, and the Foster of our Lord the King find such a Fault in his Wood within the Precindl, that Wood shall be taken into the KingÕs Hands by the KingÕs Commandment, or of his Chief Justice, and the Woodward is to be attached by Four Pledges. If any Man shall have a Wood against the Demesne Wood of our Lord the King, it is lawful for him after that the Demesne Hedges are agisted, to have in the Time of Pawnage so many Swine as the Wood may suffer, by the View of the Foster, Verdor, Regardor, Agistor, and other lawful Men, and this shall be done of the Profit of the Swine. Know that in the Time of Pawnage, when the Agistment ought to be made, the Fosters, Verdors, and Agistors ought to crave the Assent of the Justices of our Lord the KingÕs Forest, and seek their good Will, and the Agistment shall be made as well within the Demesne Hedges and Woods as without, and the Agistment shall be made according to their Commandment, and Tenour of their Letters, which Letters he shall have before the Justices of the Forest in the next Circuit. And it is commanded, that hereafter be taken for every Hog as much as may be, to the Use of our Lord the King for Pawnage, that is to say, One Penny or ii d. but of little Pigs there shall be no more paid then was before. If any Man of another County put or willingly suffer his Cattle to go within the Bounds of the Forest, the Foster may retain the Cattle by Sure.ties and safe Pledges, which if he cannot do, by the Testimony of the Verdors he shall shew the Sheriff of the County thereof, that he may make Distress until he find Pledges ; if the Sheriff do it not the Foster shall shew the same to the Justices. No Mower shall bring with him a great Mastive to drive away the Deer of our Lord the King, but little Dogs [to look to such Things as lie open.*] Of those which claim to have Privileges, as Dogs [without Claws,5] and Greyhounds, within the Bounds of the Forest, they shall have nothing to do without our Lord the KingÕs Warrant, or his Justices. A Wood remaining in the Hands of our Lord the King by One Year and One Day, it is in the KingÕs Pleasure, except it be recovered by the Judgement of the Justices. All the Bounds of the whole Forest are the KingÕs.

* This Title is from the Old Printed Copies, which attribute these Articles to the l ime of Edw. I. In most of the English and modern Editions they have been inserted as Stat. 2. of 34 Edw. I; but in the several MSS. quoted they follow immediately after the Statute of Wynton. In Rast. 1603 is a Note, * This seemeth not to be any Statute.Õ On Rot. Pat. 13 Edxv. I. m. 13. is an Entry of a Commission by Letters Patent, intituled in the Margin Ô De militibj assignatis ad artiefos in statuto p conser- vaooe pads edito contentos ob'iSvandis, &c.Õ The Commission is directed to W. de Stickeland and R. de Engleys, and bears teste Ô Edm. Com. Cornub consanguiii Reg apud Westm xx. die Januarii.Õ It diredls particular Enquiry to be made in the County of Westmorland as to the Execution of the Statute of Winchester: and a Writ is subjoined to the Sheriff to summon Juries to enquire accordingly Like Commissions and Writs were sent into Thirty-one other Counties. On Rot. Claus. 3 Edw. II. m. 7. also is an Entry of a Writ to W. de Saint Geotge, W. de Sanston, and the Sheriff of Cambridge, intituled in the Margin Ô De articulis Statuf Wynton ob^iandis.Õ The Writ recites that a Commission had been then lately granted, to enquire into the Observance of the Statute, which Commission had not been duly enforced, and the Writ requires that the same shall be executed according to the Articles in the Commission contained. Like Writs were sent into Thirty-seven other Counties. In CayÕs Edition an imperfedf Copy of the Articles in the Text was given, Ô E prrantiquo MS.Ô

¥ The Various Readings are from the Copy printed in RastallÕs Collection, 1557, title Abjuration; where it is preceded by the following Instrument, quoted as Ô Tract de Officiis Coronatoru,Õ which Rastall says he could not find in any written or primed book, but only in the Abridgement of Statutes. The Translations are from the Edition of Rastall's Collection in English, 1603.

WHEN a Robber, Murderer, or other evil-doer shall fly unto any Church upon his confession of felony, the Coroner shall cause the abjuration to be made thus: Let the Felon be brought to the Church door, and there be assigned unto him a port, near or far off, and a time appointed to him to go out of the Realm, so that in going towards that port he carry a cross in his hand, and that he go notout of the King's highway, neither on the right hand, nor on the left, but that he keep it always until he shall be gone out of the Land; and that he shall not return without special favour of our Lord the King.

Statute the First.

WHEREAS Hugh Spenser the Father, and Hugh Spenser the Son, late at the Suit of Thomas then Earl of Lancaster and Leicester, and Steward of England, by the common assent and award of the Peers and Commons of the Realm, and by the Assent of King Edward Father to our Sovereign Lord the King that now is, as Traitors and Enemies of the King and of his Realm, were exiled, disherited, and banished out of the Realm for ever; and afterward, the same Hugh and Hugh, by evil council which the King had [taken of them,'] without the Assent of the Peers and Com.mons of the Realm, came again into the Realm; and they, with other, procured the said King to pursue the said Earl of Lancaster, and other great men and people of this Realm, in which pursuit, the said Earl of Lancaster, and other great men and people of the Realm were [willingly dead '] and disherited, and some out.lawed, banished, and disherited, and some disherited and imprisoned, and some ransomed and disherited; and after such Mischief, the said Hugh and Hugh, Master Robert Baldocke, and Edmond late Earl of Arundel usurped to them the Royal Power, so that the King nothing did nor would do, but as the said Hugh, and Hugh, Robert, and Edmond Earl of Arundel did counsel him, were it never so great wrong; during which Usurpation, by duress and Force against the will of the [Commons,1] they purchased Lands as well by Fines levied in the Court of the said King Ed.ward, as otherwise: And Whereas after the death of the said Earl of Lancaster, and of other great men, our Sovereign Lord the King that now is, and Dame Isabel, Queen of England, his Mother, by the KingÕs will and Common Counsel of the Realm, went over into France, to treat a Peace between the two Realms of England

and France, upon certain Debates then moved; The said Hugh and Hugh, Robert, and Edmond Earl of Arundel continuing their Mischief, encouraged the said King Edward against our Sovereign Lord the King that now is, his Son, and the said Queen his Wife, and by the Royal Power which they had to them incroached, as afore is said, procured so much Grievance, by the assent of the said King Edward, to our Sovereign Lord the King that now is, and the Queen his Mother, then being beyond the Sea, that they remained as forsaken of the said King Edward, and as exiled from this Realm of England : Wherefore it was necessary for our Sovereign Lord the King that now is, and the Queen his Mother, being in so great jeopardy of them.selves in a strange Country, and seeing the Destruction, Damage, Oppressions, and Disherisons which were no.toriously done in the Realm of England, upon Holy Church, Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other great Men and [the Commonalty '] by the said Hugh and Hugh, Robert, and Edmond Earl of Arundel, by the encroach.ing of such Royal Power to them, to take as good Counsel therein as they might ; and seeing they might not remedy the same [unless Õ] they came into England with an army of men of war, and by the Grace of God, with such puissance and with the help of great men and Commons of the Realm, they have vanquished and destroyed the said Hugh and Hugh, Robert, and Ed.mond (J): Wherefore our Sovereign Lord King Ed.

FIRST, That no great Man nor other, of what Estate, Dignity, or Condition he be, that came with the said King that now is, and with the Queen his Mother, into the Realm of England, nor none other, then dwelling in England that came [with '3 the said King that now is, and the Queen, in Aid of them to pursue their said Enemies, in which Pursuit the King his Father was (6) taken and put in Ward, and yet remaineth in Ward, shall not be impeached, molested, nor grieved, in Person nor in Goods, in the KingÕs Court, nor other Court, for the Pursuit of the said King, taking and with-holding of his Body, nor Pursuit of any other, nor taking of their Persons, Goods, nor Death of any Man, or any other Things perpetrate or committed in the said Pursuit, from the Day that the said King and Queen did arrive, till the Day of the Coronation of the same King: and it is not the KingÕs Mind, that such Offenders that committed any Trespass, or other Offence out of the said Pursuit should go quit or have Advantage of this Statute, but they shall be at their answer for the same at the Law.

ITEM, That the Repeal of the said Exile, which was made by duress and force, be annulled for evermore; and the same Exile made by Award of the Peers and the Commons, by the KingÕs Assent as afore is said, shall stand in his Strength in all Points, after the Tenour of every Article therein contained.

ITEM, That the Executors of the Testament of all those that were of the same Quarrel [dead,7] shall have Actions and recover the Goods and Chattels of them being of the said Quarrel whose Executors they be, as they of the same Quarrel [should.8] And that Fines, Sales, and Gifts of Land, and Recognisances of Debts, after the time of the Exile of the said Hugh and Hugh,

It is also agreed and stablished, that if Duress any Man will by way of Adion, defeat any Fine, Sale, avoided, or Gift of Land, and Recognisances of Debts, made by force or duress to the said Persons as above is said, he shall have a Writ out of the Chancery to cause the Transcript of [the Fote and 1 ] of the Fine, and the Tenor of the Recognisances to be had before the King and his Justices, assigned to hold Pleas before the King, with two Bishops, two Earls, and two Barons associate unto them, or else of every Estate one ; [to warn the Tenant of the Land, whereof such Fine is levied, or Gift or Sale made.

And *3 if it be found in the KingÕs Court by Confession of the Party, or by a lawful Enquest to be taken, that such Fine, Sale, or Gift, was levied or made by duress of Imprisonment, or else for fear of Death, it fhall then be defeated; and Execution to be made for the Plaintiff as pertaineth [by3] Restitution of Lands and Tenements, being in other Mens Hands than the KingÕs.

And like Process shall be made of Lands being in the KingÕs Hands, whereof Fines be levied [to warn the Keepers of the said Lands/J And in case where any will demand Land by the common Law, and such Fine or Deed be pleaded in Barr of his Demand, then it shall be done as hath been used in Times past where a Release or Quit-claim hath been pleaded in Barr of such A&ions between the Parties, or Imprisonment hath been al- ledged : but it is not the mind of the King nor of his Council, that they which have sold their Lands, [and released or quit claimed of their own free Will, should have any benefit by this Statute.

ITEM, It is Accorded, ordained, and established in IV. Amendment of the Law, that [when a Record6] Averment cometh into the KingÕs Court by Writ of false Judge- against the ment, in case where the Party alledgeth that the Record writ offer is otherwise than the Court doth record the same, the judgement.*1 Averment shall be received of the good Country, and of them which were present in the Court when the Re- I cord was made, if they do come with others of the Country by the Sheriffs Return; and if they come not the Inquest shall be taken by the good Country.

ITEM, It is Provided and established, that from hence- V. forth against the false Returns of Bailiffs of Franchises, Averment which have full Return of Writs, a Man shall have ^S*m5t Averment, and recover as well against them as against Bailiffs of the KingÕs Sheriff, as well of too little Issues returned Liberties, as in other Cases, so that it falleth not in prejudice of the Lords, nor in the blemish of their Franchise; and that the Estate of Holy Church be always saved ; and that all the Punishment fall only upon the Bailiffs, by Punishment of their Bodies, if they have not whereof to answer.

ITEM, It is Provided, that for the great Mischiefs, Damage, and Destru&ion that hath happened to divers Persons, as well of Holy Church, as of other, by the false Oaths of Jurors in Writs of Trespass j from henceforth a Writ of Attaint shall be granted, as well upon the Principal as upon the Damages, in a Writ of Trespass; and that the Chancellor which shall be for the Time, shall have Power to grant such Writs of At.taints, without speaking therefore to the King; and in such and all other Cases of Attaints, the Justices shall not let to take the Attaints for the Damages not paid.

Bench and of the other, and Justices of Assise and Gaol-delivery, shall by force of this Statute enquire of such Compulsions, Punishments, and Procurements, and hear the Complaints of all them that will complain in such Cases by Bill, and shall hear and determine such Plaints, as well at the Suit of the Party, as at the KingÕs Suit.

ITEM, Whereas divers People be disinherited, ran.somed, and undone, by the chief Keepers of the Forests on this Side Trent, and beyond, and by other Ministers, against the Form of the great Charter of the Forest, and against the Declaration made by King Edward, Son of King Henry, in form following; that is to say: Ò We will and grant for us and our Heirs, that for any Trespass done in our Forest of Vert and Venison, that the Foresters in whose Bailiwick such Trespass shall be committed, shall present the same Trespasses at the next Swanimote before the Foresters, Verders, Regarders, Agisters, and other Ministers of the same Forest; and upon such Pre.sentment made before the said Foresters, Verders, Re.garders, and Agisters, and other Ministers aforesaid, as well by the Oaths of Knights, as [by'] other discreet and lawful Men, and not suspicious, of the Parties adjoining or near, where such Offences shall be so presented, and where the Truth may best and most fully be enquired, and the Truth [perfe&ly known,1] then such Present.ments by the common assent and consent of all the said Ministers shall be solemnly [written,3] and with their Seals ensealed; and if any Indiftment be in any other Manner made, the same shall be voidAnd therefore because the chief Wardens of the Forests have not ob.served the same Form hitherto, It is agreed and or.dained, that from henceforth no Man shall be taken nor imprisoned for Vert or Venison, unless he be taken with the Maner, or else indifted after the Form before specified ; and then the chief Warden of the Forest shall let him to Mainprise till the Eyre of the Forest, without any thing taking for his Deliverance ¥, and if the said Warden will not so do, he shall have a Writ out of the Chancery, which hath been in old time ordained for such Persons indicted, to be at Mainprise till the Eyre. And if such Warden, after he hath received the Writ, do not incontinently deliver such Persons indicted, to Mainprise, without taking any thing, then the Plaintiff shall have a Writ out of the Chancery to the Sheriff, to attach the said Warden to be before the King at a cer.tain Day, to answer wherefore he hath not replevied him that is so taken; and the Sheriff, the Verders being called to him, shall deliver him that is so taken by good Mainprise, in the Presence of the Verders, and shall deliver the Names of the Mainpernors to the same Verders to answer in the Eyre before the Justices. And if the chief Warden be thereof attainted, the Plaintiffs shall have their treble Damages awarded them, and the said Warden shall be committed to Prison, and ransomed at the KingÕs Will: and from henceforth it shall be written to them as to the chief Wardens of the Forest, because they may not be Justices, nor have any Record but in the Eyre.

Dated at Westminster the Seventh Day of March, in the First Year of the Reign of the said King Edward that now is.

Statute the Second.

TO the Honour of God and of Holy Church, and to the redress of the Oppressions of the People, King Edward [the Third,Õ] at his Parliament holden at West.minster after the Purification of our Lady, in the 1Õ irst Year of his Reign, at the request of the Commonalty of his Realm, by their Petition made before him and his Council in the Parliament, by Assent of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other great Men assembled at the said Parliament, hath granted for him and his Heirs for ever these Articles underwritten.

FIRST, that the Great Charter of the Liberties, and the Charter of the Forest be observed and kept in every Article. And that the Perambulations of the Forest (:) in time of King Edward, Grandfather to the King that now is, be from henceforth holden in the like Form as it was then riden and bounded; and thereupon a Charter to be made to every Shire where it was riden [and bounded.]] And in such Places where it was not [bounded,3] the King will that it shall be [bounded 3] by good Men and lawful, and that a Charter be there.upon made as afore is said. Item, every Man that hath any Wood within the Forest may take Houseboot and Heyboot in his said Wood, without being attached for the same by any Ministers of the Forest, so that he do the same by the View of the Foresters.

AND because before this Time in the Time of King Edward, Father to the King that now is, the King by evil Counsellors caused to be seised into his Hands the Temporalties of divers Bishops, with all their Goods and Chattels therein found, without any Cause (3) and the same held in his Hands by a long Season, and continually thereof took the Profits, to the great Damage of the same Bishops, Wastes and Destructions of all their Castles, Manors, Parks, and Woods : The King will and granted), That from henceforth it shall not be done.

ITEM, Whereas King Edward, Father to the King that now is, in Times past had pardoned his People of all Issues and Amerciaments, till the xx. Year of the Reign of his Father, and afterward without having regard to the said Pardon, the said Issues and Amerciaments have been levied, to the great Damage of the People: The King will that as touching the same Issues and Amercia.ments, his Father's grant shall be executed. And that the JewsÕ Debts be also pardoned.

ITEM, For the case of the People which hath been before this Time grieved by outrageous levying of the KingÕs Debts; The King will and granteth, that the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer may determine and [ordain1'] every Debt due to the King to the Sum of Estates, three hundred pound, according to the Estate of the Debtors, saving always their countenance. And that they shall not charge the Sheriffs, Bayliffs of Liberties, nor none other Accomptants in the Exchequer, to levy any Sum of any Person, if he do charge him of as much as he may levy by his Oath, without abating the DebtorÕs Countenance; but the Answers of the Sheriffs, and of other Ministers, shall be taken according to the Point of their Oaths.

ITEM, The King will that no Man from henceforth shall be charged to arm himself, otherwise than he was wont in the Time of his Progenitors Kings of England ; and that no Man be compelled to go out of his Shire, but [where necessity requireth, and sudden coming'] of strange Enemies into the Realm; and then it shall be done as hath been used in times past for the defence of the Realm.

ITEM, Because the Commons have felt great Grief, whereas they granted any Aid to the King of their Goods, and certain were assigned to tax their Goods, and the

Taxers have levied the same Tax, and yielded their Ac- coinpt for the same at the Exchequer, and there paid the Money ; Justices have been assigned after to enquire of their doings; which Justices have taken Ransoms and Fines of the Taxer's and other, by colour of their Com.missions, to the great Oppression and Impoverishing of them ; The King will, that from henceforth they shall be taxed after the old manner, and not otherwise.

ITEM, Whereas Commissions have been awarded to certain People of Shires to prepare Men of Arms, and convey them to the King into Scotland or Gascoign, or elsewhere, at the charge of the Shires ; the King hath not before this Time given any Wages to the said Pre.parers and Conveyers, nor Soldiers whom they have brought, whereby the Commons of the Counties have been at great Charge, and much impoverished ; The King will that it shall be done so no more.

ITEM, Whereas some of the Realm have grievously complained, that they be grieved by Sheriffs, naming themselves the KingÕs Approvers, which take Money by Extortion for Beaupleader ; The King will, That the Statute of Marlebridge shall be observed and kept in this Point.

ITEM, The King will, That Cities, Boroughs, - and franchised Towns, shall enjoy their Franchises, Customs, and Usages, as they ought and were wont to do.

ITEM,Whereas Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, [Abbesses, and Prioresses '] have been before this Time sore grieved by the KingÕs Requests and his Progeni.tors, which have desired them by great Threats, for their Clerks and other Servants, for great Pensions, Prebends, Churches, and Corodies, so that they might nothing give nor do to such as had done them Service, nor to their Friends, to their great Charge and Damage; The King granteth, that from henceforth he will no more such Things desire, but where he ought.

ITEM, [The CommonsÕ] do grievously complain, that when divers Persons, as well Clerks as Lay People, have been indicted before Sheriffs in their Turns, and after by Inquests procured, be delivered before the Justices ; after their Deliverance they do sue in the Spiritual Court against such Indiftors, surmising against them that they have defamed them, to the great Damage of the In- dictors, wherefore many People of the Shire be in fear to indidt such Offenders; The King will, that in such Case every Man that feeleth himself grieved thereby, shall have ^Prohibition formed in the Chancery upon his Case.

ITEM, Whereas divers People of the Realm complain themselves to be grieved, because that Lands and Te.nements which be holden of the King in chief, and aliened without Licence, have been seised heretofore into the KingÕs Hands, and holden as forfeit; The King shall not hold them as forfeit in such Case, but will and grant from henceforth, of such Lands and Tenements so aliened, there shall be reasonable Fine taken in the Chan.cery, by due Process.

ITEM, Whereas divers have complained, that they be grieved by reason of purchasing of Lands and Tenements which have been holden of the KingÕs Progenitors that now is, as of Honours, and the same Lands and Tene.ments have been taken into the KingÕs Hands, as though they had been holden in chief of the King, as of his Crown; The King will, That from henceforth no Man be grieved by any such Purchase.

ITEM, Because the King desireth that common Right be administered to all Persons, as well poor as rich ; he commandeth and defendeth, that none of his Coun.sellors, nor of his House, nor none other of his Ministers, nor no great Man of the Realm by himself, nor by other, by sending of Letters, nor otherwise, nor none other in this Land, great nor small, shall take upon them to maintain Quarrels nor Parties in the Country, to the let and disturbance of the Common Law.

ITEM, Whereas many in this Realm in the Time of the KingÕs Father that now is, by means of his false and evil Counsellors, have been excited by Dures, to bind

OUR Lord King Edward, the Third after the Con.quest, at his Parliament holden at Northampton, at the three weeks of Easter, in the second year of his Reign, desiring that the Peace of his Land, and his Laws and Statutes, ordained and used before this Time, may be kept and maintained in all Points ; to the Honour of God and of Holy Church, and to the common Profit of the People, by Assent of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other great Men, and all the Commonalty sum.moned to the same Parliament, hath ordained and established in the said Parliament these Things under.written, in Form following.

FIRST, That the Great Charter, and the Charter of I. the Forest, be observed in all Points. TheChirter*.

ITEM, Whereas Offenders have been greatly encou- n. raged, because [the'] Charters of Pardon have been so Pardons easily granted in times past, of Manslaughters, Robberies, for Felony. Felonies, and other Trespasses against the Peace; It is ordained and enacted, That such Charter shall not be granted, but only where the King may do it by his Oath, that is to say, where a Man slayeth another in his own defence, or by Misfortune: And also they have been en.couraged, because that [' the Justices of Gaol-delivery, and of Oyer and Terminer, have been procured by great Men1] against the Form of the Statute made in the xxvij year of the reign of King Edward,

The Statute of Lincoln, 9 Edw. II. concerning Sheriffs, *kc. confirmed.

V.

The Statute Westminster the Second, 13 Ldw. I. chapter .59, concerning . the Delivery of Writs to the Sheriff, confirmed.

Grandfather to our Lord the King that now is, wherein is contained, that Justices assigned to take Assises, if they be Laymen, shall make Deliverance; and if the one be a Clerk, and the other a Layman, that the Lay Judge, with another of the Country associate to him, shall deliver the Gaols: Wherefore it is enafted, That such [Justices"] shall not be made against the Form of the said Statute; and that the Assises, Attaints, and Certifications be taken before the Justices commonly assigned, which should be good Men and lawful, hav.ing Knowledge of the Law, and none other, after the Form of another Statute made in the Time of the said [King Edward the First;Ô] and that the Oyers and Ter- miners shall not be granted but before Justices of the one Bench or the other, or the Justices Errants, and that for great [hurt,] or horrible Trespasses, and of the KingÕs special Grace, after the Form of the Statute thereof ordained in Time of the said Grandfather, and none otherwise.

ITEM, It is enafted, That no Man great nor small, of what Condition soever he be, except the KingÕs Ser.vants in his presence, and his Ministers in executing of the KingÕs Precepts, or of their Office, and such as be in their Company assisting them, and also [upon a Cry made for Arms to keep the Peace, and the same in such places where such Afts happen,3] be so hardy to come before the King's Justices, or other of the KingÕs Ministers doing their office, with force and arms, nor bring no force in affray of the peace, nor to go nor ride armed by night nor by day, in Fairs, Markets, nor in the presence of the Justices or other Ministers, nor in no part elsewhere, upon pain to forfeit their Armour to the King, and their Bodies to Prison at the KingÕs pleasure. And that the KingÕs Justices in their presence, Sheriffs, and other Ministers (*) in their Baili.wicks, Lords of Franchises, and their Bailiffs in the same, and Mayors and Bailiffs of Cities and Boroughs, within the same' Cities and Boroughs, and Borough- Holders, Constables, and Wardens of the Peace within their Wards, shall have Power to execute this Aft. And that the Justices assigned, at their coming down into the Country, shall have Power to enquire how such Officers and Lords have exercised their Offices in this Case, and to punish them whom they find that have not done that which pertained to their Office.

ITEM, Because the Peace cannot be well kept without good Ministers, as Sheriffs, Bailiffs, and Hundreders, which ought to do Execution as well of the KingÕs Privities as of other Things touching our Lord the King and his People; It is ordained and established, That the Statute made in the time of King Edward, Father to the King that now is, at Lincoln, containing that Sheriffs, Hundreders, and Bailiffs shall be of such People as have Lands in the same Shires or Bailiwicks, shall be observed in all Points after the Form thereof; and that Sheriff's and Bailiffs of Fee shall cause their Counties and Bailiwicks to be kept by such as have Lands therein.

ITEM, Where it was ordained by the Statute of West.minster the Second, that they which will deliver their Writs to the Sheriff, shall deliver them in the full County, or in the Rere County, and that the Sheriff or under Sheriff shall thereupon make a Bill; It is accorded and established, that at what Time or Place in the County a Man doth deliver any Writ to the Sheriff or to the Under-Sheriff, that they shall receive the same Writs, and make a Bill, after the form contained in the same Statute, without taking any Thing therefore ; and if they refuse to make a Bill, others that be present shall set to their Seals; and if the Sheriff or Under-Sheriff do not return the said Writs, they shall be punished after the form contained in the same Statute ; and also the Justices of Assises shall have power to enquire thereof at every ManÕs Complaint, and to award Damages, as having respeft to the Delay, and to the loss and peril that might happen

And that every Lord at the begin.ning of his Fair shall there do cry and publish how long the Fair shall endure ; to the Intent that Merchants shall not be at the same Fairs over the Time so published, upon pain to be grievously punished towards the King ; nor the said Lords shall not hold them over the due Time, upon pain to seize the Fairs into the KingÕs hands, there to remain till they have made a Fine to the King for the Offence, after it be duly found, that the Lords held the same Fairs longer than they ought, or that the Merchants have sitten above the Time so cried and published.

ITEM, It is accorded, That no Sheriff, Bailiff of Hun.dred, Wapentake, nor of Franchise, nor Under-Escheat- ors, shall be from henceforth, except he have Lands sufficient in the Place where they be Ministers, whereof to answer the King and his People, in case that any Man complain against them; as it was ordained at another Time at the Parliament holden at Lincoln, in the Time of the KingÕs Father that now is, that is to say, in the Ninth Year of his Reign.

ITEM, Whereas in Times past, Sheriffs and Gaolers of Gaols would not receive Thieves, Persons appealed, in- difted, or found with the maner, taken and attached by the Constables and Townships, without taking great Fines and Ransoms of them for their Receipt, whereby the said Constables and Townships have been unwil.ling to take Thieves and Felons, because of such ex.treme Charges, and the Thieves and the Felons the more encouraged to offend; It is enafted, That the Sheriffs and Gaolers shall receive and safely keep in Prison from henceforth such TIlieves and Felons, by the delivery of the Constables and Townships, without taking any thing for the Receipt; and the Justices assigned to deliver the Gaol, shall have Power to hear their Complaints that will complain upon the Sheriffs and Gaolers in such case, and moreover to punish the Sheriffs and Gaolers if they be found guilty.

ITEM, Where in Times past divers People of the Realm, as well great Men as other, have made Alliances, Confederacies, and Conspiracies, to maintain Pardes, Pleas, and Quarrels, whereby divers have been wrong.fully disinherited ; and some ransomed and destroyed ; and some, for fear to be maimed and beaten, durst not sue for their Right, nor complain, nor the Jurors of Inquests give their Verdifts, to the great hurt of the People, and [Slander'] of the Law, and common right; It is accorded, that the Justices of the one Bench and of the other, and the Justices of Assises, whensoever they come to hold their Sessions, or to take Inquests upon Nisi prius, shall enquire, hear, and determine, as well at the KingÕs Suit, as at the Suit of the Party, of such Maintainers, Bearers and Conspirators, and also of them that commit Champerty, and of all other things contained in the foresaid Article, as well as Justices in Eyre should do if they were in the same County; and that which cannot be determined before the Justices of the one Bench or the other upon the Nisi prius, [for shortness of Time,1] shall be adjourned into the [Place3] whereof they be Justices, and there be determined as Right and Reason shall require.

ITEM, Because there be more Taverners in the Realm than were wont to be, selling as well corrupt Wines as wholsome, and have sold the Gallon at such Price as they themselves would, because there was no Punishment ordained for them, as hath been for them that have sold Bread and Ale, to the great hurt of the People; It is accorded, That a Crv shall be made, that none be so hardy to sell Wines but at a reasonable Price, regarding the Price that is at the Ports from whence the Wines came, and the Expences, as in Carriage of the same from the said Ports to the Places where they be sold ; and that (*) Assay shall be made of such Wines two Times every Year, once at Easter, and another Time at Michaelmas, and more often if need be, by the Lords of the Towns and their Bailiffs, and also by the Mayor and Bailiffs of the same Towns ; and all the Wines that shall be found (s) corrupt, shall be [poured out,6] and the Vessels broken.

ITEM, Because divers Charters of Pardon have been granted of Felonies, Robberies, and Manslaughters, against the form of the Statute lately made at Northampton, containing that no Man should have such Charters out of the Parliament, whereby such misdoers have been the more bold to offend ; It is enafted, That from henceforth the same Statute shall be kept and maintained in all Points.

ITEM, Whereas it is contained in a Statute late made at Westminster, in the first Year of the Reign of our

Lord the King that now is, after his Coronation, that ^ ___^

Attaints should be granted in Writs of Trespass ; It is pa)l Forty accorded and established, That Writs of Attaint shall Shilling*, be from henceforth granted as well in Pleas of Trespass See Statute moved without Writ, as by Writ, before Justices of JÔe $ Record, if the Damages judged do pass xl. s.; and this Statute shall hold Place as well of Inquests taken in Times past, as to be taken in Time to come.

Item, Because that Persons indifted of Felonies, Rob- VIII. beries, and Theft, in Times past have removed the same t1Õ*. oj. Indiftment before the King, and there yielded themselves, prisoner* by and by the Marshals of the KingÕs Bench have been in- the Marshal* continently let to Bail, and after have done many evil of thf KingÕ* Deeds, and lien in wait to slay and evil intreat their Benc ' Enditors; and also Persons appealed of Felony, after the Exigent awarded, have yielded themselves before the King, and have been let to Bail by the said Marshals:

It is accorded and established, That such Enditees and Appellees shall be safely and surely kept in Prison, as belongeth to them according to the Charge which the said Marshals shall have of the Justices. And if any Marshal do otherwise, at the Complaint of every Man that will complain, the Justices shall do him right during the Terms; and in the End of the Terms, upon their rising, the said Marshals shall choose before the said Justices, before they depart the Places, in what Town they will keep such Prisoners, at their Peril; and in the same Town they shall [allow to them1]

Houses to keep such Prisoners at their own Costs and

Charges ; and there they shall keep them in Prison, and

by Bail nor without Bail: and if any such Prisoner The Penalty

Bail, and that be found at the KingÕs Suit, or at the atlarge? 8¡

Suit of the Party, the Marshals which shall be found

thereof guilty, shall have half a YearÕs Imprisonment,

and be ransomed at the KingÕs Will; and the Justices

shall thereof make Enquiry when they see Time ; and

as to the Marshals, [it shall be done within the Verge,3]

that which reason will. And in case that the Marshals or etcape.

suffer by their Assent such Prisoners to escape, they

shall be at the Law, as before this Time they have been.

And the King intendeth not by this Statute to lose the the Escape, where he ought to have the same.

ITEM, It is enafted, That no Man from henceforth IX. shall be attached by any Accusation, nor forejudged of unlawful Life or Limb, nor his Lands, Tenements, Goods, nor g^c " Õ Chattels seised into the KingÕs Hands, against the Form of the Great Charter, and the Law of the Land.

XII.

Of Pardon on Outlawries.

Satisfa&ion of PlaintiffÕs .Damages.

On Outlawry before

Appearance, Party out.lawed shall yield himself.

Plaintiff shall he warned to appear and proceed.

XIII.

Averment of Plaintiffs (or for the King) shall be received against Imprison.ment, alleged to defeat Outlawry.

XIV. 13 Edw. I.

Arrest of Night- walkers and others suspe&ed.

Inquests of Sheriffs thereon returnable to Justices of Gaol delivery.

assigned to hear and determine such Felonies, shall direct their Writs to all the Counties of England, where need shall be, to take such Persons indidted.

ITEM, It is established and ordained, That in case where the Plaintiff shall recover Damages, and he against whom the Damages be recovered be outlawed at the KingÕs Suit, that no Charter of Pardon shall be granted of [his'] Outlawry, except the Chancellor be certified that the Plaintiff is satisfied of his Damages. And in case that a man be outlawed by Process before his Appearance, no such Charter shall be granted, except the Chancellor be certified that such Person outlawed hath yielded him.self to prison before the Justices of the Place, from whence the Writ of Exigent issued; that is to say, if from the KingÕs [Bench,1] then he shall yield him in the same Place; and if from the Common [Bench,1] then he shall yield himself there ; and if from the Justices of Oyer (3) Terminer, whiles the same Justices do sit, he shall yield him before them ; and if they be risen, then he shall yield him in the KingÕs Bench before the Jus.tices, and the Record with the Process shall be removed before them by Writ: And the said Justices before whom they shall so yield them, shall cause the Party Plaintiff to be warned to appear before them at a certain Day ; at which Day, if the Warning be duly witnessed, and the Plaintiff appear upon his Warning, then they shall plead upon the first original Writ, as though no Outlawry had been pronounced; and if the Plaintiff come not, he that is outlawed shall be delivered by virtue of his Charter ; and it is to be understood, that all such Charters be of the Grace of the King, as before they have been.

ITEM, Because divers People being duly outlawed, have avoided the Outlawries pronounced against them, them, by reason of Imprisonments untruly testified by Sheriffs and others which have no Record ; It is enabled, That if any from henceforth will defeat any Outlawry pronounced upon him by such Testimony, that he shall yield himself to the Prison, and then the Justices of the KingÕs Bench shall cause the Party at whose Suit the Outlawry was pronounced, to be warned to be before them at a certain Day; at which Day, if the Party will verify that the Testimony is untrue, his Averment shall be received. And in like Manner the KingÕs Serjeant, or his Attorney, or other that will sue for the King, shall be received to have the same Averment against such Testimony, in case where such Outlawry is pro.nounced at the KingÕs Suit.

ITEM, Whereas in the Statute made at Winchester in the Time of King Edward, Grandfather to the King that now is, it is contained, That if any Stranger pass by the Country in the Night, of whom any have sus.picion, he shall presently be arrested and delivered to the Sheriff, and remain in Ward till he be duly de.livered: And because there have been divers Man.

slaughters, Felonies, and Robberies done in Times past, by People that be called Roberdesmen, Wastors, and Draw-latches; It is accorded, That if any [may *] have any evil Suspicion of such, be it by Day or by Night, they shall be incontinently arrested by the Constables of the Towns; and if they be arrested within Franchises, they shall be delivered to the Bailiffs of the Franchise, and if in Guildable, they shall be delivered to the She.riffs, and kept in Prison till the coming down of the Justices assigned to deliver the Gaol; and in the mean Time the Sheriffs or Bailiffs of the Franchises shall enquire of such Arrests, and at the coming of the Jus.tices return their Enquests (5) before them, with that which they have found, and the Cause of the Takings, with the Bodies, and the Justices shall proceed to the Deliverance of such Persons arrested according to the Law: And in case that the Sheriffs or Bailiffs of the Franchises have not enquired of such Arrests, they shall be amerced, and nevertheless the Justices shall make Enquiry, and further proceed to the Deliverance, as before is said.

Statute the First.

WHEREAS before this time in many Parliaments, and now at this present Parliament summoned at York, on the morrow after the Ascension, in the ninth year of the Reign of King Edward, the Third after the Conquest, it was shewed to our said Lord the King, by the Knights of the Shires, Citizens of the Cities, and Burgesses of the Boroughs, which come for the Commons of the said Shires, Cities, and Bo.roughs, that in divers Cities, Boroughs, and other Places of his Realm, great Duress and grievous Da.mage have been done to him and his People by some people of Cities, Boroughs, Ports of the Sea, and other Places of the said Realm, which in long time past have not suffered, nor yet will suffer Merchant Strangers, nor other, which do carry and bring in by Sea or Land, Wines, [Aver de pois,Õ] and other Livings and Victuals, with divers other Things to be sold, ne.cessary and profitable for the King, his Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other Noblemen, and the Commons of this Realm, to sell or deliver such Wines, Livings, Vic.tuals, nor other Things to any other than to them.selves, of the (Ô) Cities, Boroughs, Ports of the Sea, or other Places where such Wines, Livings, Viftuals, and other Things to be sold, shall be brought or car.ried by reason whereof such stuff aforesaid is sold to the King and to his People, in the hands of the said Citizens, Burgesses, and other People, Denizens,

Merchants may freely buy and sell, except to Enemies.

Double Damages to Merchants interrupted j and also Forfeiture of Franchise, Sec.

more dear than they should be, if such Merchant Strangers, and others, which bring such Things into the Realm, might freely sell them to whom they would, to the great damage of our Lord the King, and of his Pre.lates, Earls, Barons, and other Nobles of this Realm, and grievous oppression of his Commons: Whereupon the said Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, for them and [the1 *] Commons, desired our said Lord the King in his said Parliament, by their Petition, that for [the ÕJ profit and [commodity3 *] of [his'] Prelates, Earls, Barons, [and other Nobles of this Realm,5] it may please him without further delay upon the said Grievances and Outrage to provide Remedy:

Our Lord the King, desiring the profit of his People, [by the assent of6] his Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other Nobles of his Realm, summoned at his Parlia.ment, and [by the advice7 *] of his Council being there, upon the said things disclosed to him [and found true,*] to the great hurt [of the said Prelates,9] Earls, and Barons, and other Nobles of his Realm, and op.pression of his Commons, [hath ,0] ordained and esta.blished, that all Merchants, Strangers and Denizens, and all other, and every of them, of what estate or condition soever they be, that will buy or sell Corn, Wines, Aver de pois, Flesh, Fish, and all other Livings and Vi&uals, Woolls, Clothes, Wares, Merchandises, and all other Things vendible, from whence soever they come by Foreigners or Denizens, at what place soever it be, City, Borough, Town, Port of the Sea, Fair, Market, or else.where within the Realm, within Franchise or without, may freely without interruption sell them to what Per.sons it shall please them, as well to Foreigners, as De.nizens ; except always the Enemies of our Lord the King, and of his Realm. And if haply any disturbance be done to any Merchant, Stranger, or Denizen, or any other, for the sale of such Things in any City, Borough, Town, Port of the Sea, or other Place which hath Fran.chise, and the Mayors and Bailiffs, or other which hath the rule of such Franchise, being required by the said Merchants, or other, thereof to provide remedy, and do not, and be thereof attainted, the Franchise shall be seised into the KingÕs hands ; and nevertheless he and the other which hath done this disturbance against this Statute, shall be bound to yield and restore to the said Merchant his double damages which he hath thereby sustained. And if such disturbance or interruption be done to such Merchants, or to other in such Towns or Places where no Franchise is, and the Lord, if he be present, or his Bailiff, Constable, or other Ruler of the said Towns and Places, in the absence of the Lords, being therein required to do right, and do not, and thereof be attainted ; they shall yield to the Party Plain.tiff his Double Damages, as afore is said ; and the dis.turbers in the one case and the other, as well within Franchises as without, if they be attainted, shall have one yearÕs Imprisonment, and nevertheless be ransomed at the KingÕs Will. And It is ordained and established, that no Alien or Denizen, upon the same pain, shall be troubled, but that he may freely buy such Things aforesaid in the said Places, and cariy them where it pleaseth him, to his own use, or to the profit of the King, or of the great Men, or the Commons of the Realm ; saving that such Merchants Aliens shall carry no Wine out of the same Realm, as is contained in their Charter: And it is enafted and established, that the Things aforesaid shall be observed, performed, and kept in every City, Borough, Town, Port of the Sea, and other Places within the Realm, notwithstanding Charters of Franchise granted to them to the contrary, nor Usage, nor Custom, nor Judgement given upon their Char.ters, Usages, or Customs that they can alledge ; which

Item, At the request of the said Commons made to UL our Lord the King in his said Parliament, It is ordained and established by our Lord the King, by the Assent of fourc|Ó0ky the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other great Men, and Essoin, the Commons aforesaid, that in a Writ of Debt brought against divers Executors, the same Executors, nor any of them, shall have but one Essoign before Appearance, that is to say, at the Summons or Attachment; nor after Appearance they shall have but one Essoign, as the Testator should have had; so that (') all the Ex.ecutors do [present1] the Person of the Testator as one Person: It is also enafted, that though the Sheriff Process do answer at the Summons, that some of them have E^^ãtors nothing whereby he may be summoned, yet there shall an Attachment be awarded upon [them3] ; and if the Sheriff answer, that he hath nothing whereby he may be attached, the great Distress shall be awarded, so that at the great Distress returned upon them, he or they that do first appear in the Court shall answer to the Plaintiff.

And although some of them have appeared in the Court, and make Default at the Day that the great Dis.tress is returned upon the other, yet nevertheless he or they shall be put to answer, that first appeared, at the great Distress returned; and in case the Judgement Judgment pass for the Plaintiff, he shall have his Judgement and a?Ònst a Õ Execution against them that have pleaded, according to only plead, the Law heretofore used, and against all other named in the Writ, of the Goods of the Testator, as well as if they had all pleaded. And it is to be understood, that if any, in such case, will sue according to the Law that hath been used heretofore, he may freely do it notwithstanding this Statute.

And because in Times past many have been oftentimes IV. delayed of their Aftion, as well in Assises and other Where Deeds Pleas of Land, as in Contrafts, Covenants, and Tres- are datcd passes, by reason that the Tenants or Defendants have xiTvWrit pleaded in Bar a Release, Quit-claim, or other special runneth no", Deed, made within a Franchise within the Bounds of Inquest* the Realm, where the KingÕs Writ runneth not; It is šha11 not bc enafted and established, That when such Deeds be for,P^Õ shewed forth in Bar of an Aftion, bearing Date in a Absence of Place within the same Franchise, although there be Witnesses Witnesses of the same Franchise named in the same 10 the D"*1* Deeds, if the same Deeds be denied, Process shall

[EDWARD by the Grace of God King of England, For the &c. to the Sheriff of N.Õ] greeting.

FIRST, It is provided that from henceforth no Re.ligious Man, nor other, shall carry any Sterling out of the Realm of England, nor Silver in Plate, nor Vessel of Gold nor of Silver, upon pain of Forfeiture of the Money, Plate, or Vessel that he shall so carry without our especial Licence.

ITEM, That no false Money or counterfeit Sterling be brought into the Realm, nor elsewhere within our Power, upon Forfeiture of such Money ; so always that all People of what Realm or Dominion they be, may safely bring [to the Exchanges, and to no Place else,

Statute the First.

BECAUSE our Lord the King, Edward the Third after the Conquest, which sovereignly desireth the Maintenance of his Peace, and Safeguard of his People, hath perceived at the Complaint of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and also at the shewing of the Knights of the Shires and his Commons, by their Petition put in his Parliament holden at Westminster the Monday next after Midlent, in the Tenth Year of his Reign, divers Oppressions and Grievances done to his said People, and namely by Murderers, Robbers, Thieves, Ravishers of Women, and other Felons; coveting, to obvent the Malice of such Felons, and to [[see1] a [conveniable'] Remedy, hath ordained and established, by the Assent of the said Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other Nobles of [thisJ] Realm, and at the Request of the said Knights and Commons, for the quietness and peace of his People, that the Articles underneath written be kept and main.tained in all Points.

FIRST, It is accorded and established, That the Great Charter, and the Charter of the Forest, and also the Statutes made in the Time of the KingÕs Progenitors, and also in his own Time, be kept, holden, and firmly maintained, as well by the great Men as by the small, and the rich Men as the poor.

ITEM, Whereas Murderers, Robbers, (*) and other Felons, be greatly encouraged to offend, by reason that Charters of Pardon, of Manslaughter, Robbery, Felonies, and other Trespasses against the Peace, have been so lightly granted before this Time; It is accorded and established by our Lord the King, by the Assent of his Prelates, Earls, (s) Barons, and at the Request of the said Knights, and Commons, that no such Charters from henceforth shall be granted by our Lord the King, against the Form of a Statute late made at Northampton the Second Year of his Reign.

AND [as6] Charters granted in Times past: It is ac.corded and established, by our Sovereign Lord the King, by the same Assent, and at the Request aforesaid, that all such which have such Charters, shall come before the Sheriffs, and Coroners of the Counties, where the Felo.nies be done, between this and the Feast of the Nativity of Saint John Baptist next coming, and every of them shall find before the said Sheriffs and Coroners of the Coun.ties where the Felonies be done, (Õ) good and sufficient Mainpernors, for whom the said Sheriffs and Coroners will answer, that they from henceforth shall bear them.selves well and lawfully ; and the Mainprises shall be sealed with their Seals, and returned in the Chancery at the xv. of the said Feast of Saint John: And they that will aid themselves by such Charters, and have not found Mainprise, as above is said, or after the Mainprise found, bear themselves otherwise against the Peace than they ought, their Charters shall be holden for none. And in case that our Sovereign Lord the King grant any such Charters in Time to come, that within Three Months after the making of the same, they that (*) have the said Charters, shall come and find before the said Sheriffs and Coroners of the Counties where the Felo.nies be done, such (9) Mainprise, and also as before is said of their good bearing; and be the said Mainprises sealed and returned in the Chancery within Three Weeks after the end of the said Three Months: and if they that shall have such Charters will in Time to come aid themselves thereby, and have not found such Main.prises, or after such Mainprises found, do bear them otherwise against the Peace than they ought, their Charters shall be holden for none, as afore is said.

then present, to hear their Cause and Reasons of such Delays; which Cause and Reason so heard, by good Advice of themselves, the Chancellor, Treasurer, the Justices of the one Bench and of the other, and other of the KingÕs Council, as many and such as they shall think convenient, shall proceed to take a good Accord, and make a good Judgement; and according to the same Accord so taken, the tenor of the said Record, together with the Judgement which shall be accorded, shall be remanded before the Justices, before whom the Plea did depend, and that they hastily go to give Judgement ac.cording to the same [ Record ' j: And in case it seemeth Adjournment to them that the difficulty be so great, that it may not well be determined without Assent of the Parliament, in Qf that the said tenor or tenors shall be brought by the Difficulty, said Prelate, Earls, and Barons, unto the next Parlia.ment, and there shall be a final Accord taken what Judgement ought to be given in this Case ; and according to this Accord it shall be commanded to the Judges, before whom the Plea did depend, that they shall pro.ceed to give Judgement without Delay. And to begin to do Remedy upon this Ordinance, it is assented, that a Commission and a Power shall be granted to the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earls of Arundel and Huntington, the Lord of Wake, and the Lord Ralfe Basset, to endure till the next Parliament. And though Chancellor, the Ministers have made an Oath before this time, yet Judges, Scc. nevertheless to remember them of the same Oath, it is 0*

assented, that as well the Chancellor, Treasurer, Keeper office, of the Privy Seal, the Justices of the one Bench and of the other, the Chancellor, Barons of the Exchequer, as the Justices assigned, and all they that do meddle in the said Places under them, by the Advice of the same Archbishop, Earls, and Barons, shall make an Oath well and lawfully to serve the King and his People ; and by the Advice of the said Prelate, Earls, and Barons, be it ordained to increase the Number of the Ministers when need shall be, and them to diminish in the same Manner; and so from Time to Time, when Officers shall be newly put in the said Offices, they shall be sworn in the same Manner.

ITEM, It is assented, That by the Misprision of a Clerk in any Place wheresoever it be, no Process shall be adnulled, or discontinued, by mistaking in Writing one Syllable, or one Letter too much or too little; but as soon as the Thing is perceived, by challenge of the party, or in other Manner, it shall be hastily amended in due form, without giving advantage to the party that challengeth the same because of such Misprision.

ITEM, Because that some Sheriffs have their Baili- VII. wicks for Term of Years of the KingÕs Grant, and some Sheriff's do so much trust to tarry in their Office by Procure- sha" ment, that they be encouraged to do many Oppressions to the People, and evil Service to the King and his ,t ,he People; It is assented and established, That no Sheriff Exchequer shall tarry in his Bailiwick over one Year, and then another convenient shall be ordained in his place, that hath Land sufficient in his Bailiwick, by the Chancellor,

Treasurer, and chief Baron of the Exchequer, taking to them the chief Justices of the one Bench and of the other, if they be present; and that shall be done yearly in the Morrow of All Souls, at the Exchequer.

ITEM, Whereas sometime there were no more but VIII. two Escheators in England, that is to say, one Escheator Escheators ; on this side Trent, and another beyond, whereby the King and the People were worse served than in the time when there were divers Escheators, and of less Estate ;

It is assented and accorded, That from henceforth there their Numb*-.; shall be as many Escheators assigned, as were in the time when the King that now is did take the Governance of this Realm upon him ; and that the same Escheators be Appointment chosen by the Chancellor, Treasurer, and the Chief Baron of the Exchequer, taking to them the Chief Justices of the one Bench and the other, if they be present, in Manner as is afore said of Sheriffs; and that no Escheator tarry in his Office above a Year ; and that no Coroner be chosen unless he have Land in Fee suffi.cient in the same County, whereof he may answer to all manner of People.

ITEM, Whereas many Mischiefs be happened through the Realm, for that the Sheriffs have let the Hundreds and Wapentakes to an higher Perm than they yield to the King, and the Fermers do let the same to other at more higher and greater Sums, in such manner that by the high letting and enhansing of the Ferms, and by the [great1 ] number of Bailiffs Errants, Out-riders, and other whom the Sheriffs, Bailiffs, and Hundreders do put in, the People be in divers manners charged and grieved ; It is assented and accorded, That from henceforth all the Wapentakes and Hundreds which be severed from the Counties, shall be rejoyned to the same Counties, as before this time hath been established by another Statute; and that the Sheriffs hold the same in their own Hands, and put in such Bailiffs and Hundreders, having Lands within the Bailiwicks and Hundreds, for whom they will answer: and if they will let any Hundreds, Bailiwicks, or Wapentakes to ferm, they shall let the same at the ancient Ferm without any thing increasing; and that the King and his People be served by such Bailiffs and Hundreders, and their Under Bailiffs, in avoiding for ever the Out-riders and other, which in divers Counties beforetime have notoriously [grieved *3 the People. And that no Bailiff Errant be, but in the Counties where Bailiffs Errants have been in times past, in the time of the KingÕs Grandfather that now is ; and that there be no more but one Bailiff Errant in one County. And in the same manner it is assented, That all other, of what Estate or Condition they be, which have Bailiwicks or Hundreds in Fee, if they the same will hold in their own Hands, then they shall put in such Bailiffs for whom they will answer; and if they will let the same in Ferm to other, then they shall let the same at the ancient Ferm without any thing increasing, as afore is said: And the Justices of the one Bench and the other, the Barons of the Exchequer, and the Justices assigned, shall have Power to inquire of all those that offend against this Ordinance, at all times that they come into the Country, and to execute such Punishment as to them shall seein convenient to be done according to the Law and Reason. And if the Sheriffs or their Fermors be found in Default in any point against this Ordinance and thereof be attainted, the Hundreds and Wapentakes where such default shall be found, shall be taken into the KingÕs Hands, and let to other by the same Justices, and [to commit them33 to Prison, there to remain till they have made Fine and Ransom to the King, according to the Quantity of the Trespass; and nevertheless they shall answer to the King of the whole Ferm. And that the Lords which hold Hundreds or Wapentakes in Fee, shall set such Bailiffs which be sufficient to answer the King and his People; and if their Bailiffs do against this Ordinance, they shall be called to answer ; and if they be attainted, they shall [have such Punishment 43 as the Law of the Land requireth in such Case, and they shall be out of their Bailiwicks for ever, and other sufficient put in their Places by the same Lords.

And that the KingÕs Jusdces, before whom such cases shall happen, shall enquire the truth thereof; and if they find by Inquest thereupon taken, that any Keeper or Under Keeper hath done the same, he shall be thereof arraigned ; and if he be found guilty, he shall have Judgement of Life and Member as afore is said.

ITEM, Where it is contained in the Great Charter, that oneMeasure and one Weight be throughout England; and also it is contained in a Statute made in the time of King Edward, Grandfather to the King that now is, that none shall sell by the Bushel, if it be not marked with the KingÕs Seal, and that it be according to the KingÕs Standard ; and also it is contained, that he which shall be attainted for having double Measure, that is to say, one greater to buy, and another less to sell, shall be imprisoned as [false,Ô3 and grievously punished ; which things have not been holden nor used after the said Establishment, to the great Grief of the People; It is assented and accorded,That from henceforth one Measure and one Weight shall be throughout the Realm of England; and that the Treasurer cause to be made certain Standards of Bushels, Gallons, of Weights of [Aunce,1 J and send the same into every County where such Stan.dards be not sent before this time ; and thereupon shall be assigned two good and sufficient Persons in every County, and more, according as the County in greatness requireth, to survey as well within Franchise as without, that the Measures and the Weights be according to the Standard, and that they have Power to inquire, hear, and determine, and to punish all those that shall be found thereof guilty; and that the Sheriffs at their Command.ments, receive and detain them in Prison till they have made Fine to the King; and every Person that will complain of such as do offend in buying or selling shall be heard, as well for the King as for himself: and that the said Assignes shall deliver their Estreats every Year in the morrow of Saint Michael, at the Exche.quer, and take for their Expences the fourth Part of that which they may levy, and answer to the King the threp Parts; and of that which may not be levied be.fore their profer, the fourth Part shall be allowed to them at the Exchequer, and the three Parts levied to the KingÕs Use.

ITEM, Whereas in the Great Charter it is contained, that after the Death of the Ancestors, which hold of the King in chief, and whose Heirs be within Age, that the King shall keep the Lands without Waste and De- struftion, and restore them wholly to the Heirs when they come to their full Age; and against God and Right, and the said Establishment, the Escheators, and other to whom the Lands of such Heirs have been committed, have done Waste and Destruftion, to the great Mischief, as well of the Heirs of Earls, Barons, and other great Men, as of other which hold of the King in Chief, and nevertheless the said Escheators have not had Conscience to do such Destruftions, and scarcely have answered the King: Wherefore It is assented and established, That from henceforth after the Death of every Person which holdeth of the King in chief, that the Escheators shall do to be seised into the KingÕs Hands the Lands as pertaineth, without doing Waste in Houses, Woods, Parks, Ponds, anil other Extortions, which may fall to the Damage of the 1 leir ; and hastily after the diem clausit extremum delivered him to return the same by a good and true Extent in the Chancery : After which Return if it be found that the Heir is within Age, and the next Friends of the Heir to whom the Inheritance cannot descend, shall come and offer them to take the said Lands, yielding Value to the King, till the Age of the Heir, as far forth as

Nisi Prius may be granted before a Justice of Common Pleas, in a Suit in King's Bench;

other will yield without Fraud, by accord betwixt the Chancellor and Treasurer, they shall have a Commission to keep the said Lands by good and sufficient Surety till the Age of the said Heirs, and to answer the King of the Value: And it is not the KingÕs Intent, that by this Statute he be foreclosed to have an Adtion of Waste against such Guardians and Fermors, as he and his Ancestors have had before this Time; and that the Heirs, when they come to their Age, shall have their Aftion by Writ of Waste against such Guardians and Fermors.

ITEM, Whereas before this Time, in case that a Man hath demanded by Petition in the Parliament cer.tain Lands and Tenements which be in the KingÕs Hands, and to the same Petitions hath been answered in the same Parliament, Chancery, or the KingÕs Bench, that the King will that a Writ be sued to the Treasurer and Chamberlains [of the Exchequer,] to search Charters, [Miniments,1] and other Remembrances, which may him avail, whereby he may be advised to make answer ; to which Writs commonly the Treasurer and Chamberlains have answered, that they have searched but not [by- searched,1] and would not answer that they have fully searched and nothing found, nor that they can no more find, but that which they have sent; whereby according to the Law afore this Time used, a Man hath not had cause to put them which be for the King to answer, and in such Manner the Demandants have been greatly de.layed to their Mischief; Wherefore It is assented, That after that the Four Writs be returned, whether [the Mini- ment5] or Remembrance be found for the King, or not, that then in the Parliament, Chancery, or in the KingÕs Bench, or in the Common Bench, they which shall sue for the King shall be put to answer, and to defend the Lands and Tenements so demanded against the King, to the best that they can or may according to the Law, so always that every of the Four Writs be delivered to the Treasurer and to the Chamberlains Forty Days be.fore the Day of the Return ; and that by Commandment of the Great Seal, or Privy Seal, no point of this Sta.tute shall be put in delay; nor that the Justices of what.soever Place it be, shall let to do the Common Law by Commandment, which shall come to them under the Great Seal or Privy Seal.

ITEM, Because by divers Statutes made before this Time in divers Parliaments it was assented, That no Charter of Pardon of the Death of a Man should be granted by the King, but in case where he may do it keeping the Oath of his Crown; which Statutes have not been holden, but Charters have been granted with.out Number to divers [Felons4] and Manslayers, to the evil Example and Fear of good People and lawful, whereby [Thieves, Felons, and Offenders5] be com.forted to do their Robberies and Man-slaughter, and the same do from Day to Day, and the more be encouraged to do the same, because of Hope easily to have their Charters of Pardon; It is assented, established, and ac.corded, That no Charter [or6] Pardon of the Death of a Man, nor of other Felony, shall be from henceforth granted to any Man, but in case where the King may the same do, saving the Oath of his Crown, as it is con.tained in the Statutes made before this Time ; and if any Charter be from henceforth granted against the said Statutes, the same shall be holden for none.

ITEM, Whereas before this Time it was established, That the Inquests and Juries which be to be taken, as well of the KingÕs Bench as of the Common Bench, should be taken before one or [more7] Justices of the same [Place,8] as it is contained in the said Establish.ment ; and now it is notoriously seen and known, that divers Inquests and Juries have been (9) taken, and yet be in divers Counties of England, where no Justice did come, to the great Mischief of the Parties that do sue, and also of the good People of the Country which be impanelled : Wherefore it is assented and stablished, That whoso demandeth the Nisi Prius in the KingÕs Bench, as well at the Suit of the Defendant, as of the Plaintiff, as before this Time hath been done by the Form of the Statute, the Nisi Prius shall be granted before any

Justice of the Place where the Plea dependeth, if any of the same Place may well go into those Parts; and if nor, then the Nisi Prius shall be granted before any Justice of the Common Bench, at a certain Day, which may be accorded, and [to deliver or send the Tenor of the Record to him 1 j under the Seal of the Chief Justice of the Place; at which Day he shall take the Inquest, and return the Verdict under his Seal with the Writ, the Te.nor, and the Panel, which shall be received in the KingÕs Bench, and there enrolled, and thereupon Judgement given according to the Verdidt of the same Inquest; and the said Justice of the Common Bench shall have Power to record Defaults and Nonsuits, as far forth as if the Nisi Prius had been granted before any Justice of the KingÕs Bench ; after which Defaults so recorded and returned in the KingÕs Bench, the Justices shall go to give Judgement upon the same Record.

Year of his Reign, and to endure till the Feast of Pentecost, then next fol.lowing, and front that Feast till the Feast of Pentecost [then next following into a Year.1] And for this Grant, the King by the assent of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and all other assembled in Parliament, hath granted, that from the Feast of Pentecost, [which cometh into one Year,'] he nor his Heirs shall not demand, assess, nor take, nor suffer to be taken more Custom of a Sack of Wool of any Englishman, but half a Mark (5) only ; and upon the Wool-fells and Leather the old Custom ; and the Sack ought to contain xxvi.

And that none cocket Wools, but in the Name of him that shall be Owner of the same ; and if any be found otherwise cocketted, they shall be taken in the KingÕs Hands as forfeit. And this Stablishment lawfully to be holden and kept, the King hath promised in the presence of the (t) Earls, Barons, and other in his Parliament, no more to charge, set, or assess, upon the Custom, but in the Manner as afore is said. In the same Manner the Prelates, Earls, and Barons, have promised lawfully, as much as in them is, that they shall procure the King, as much as they may, to hold the same ; and that they shall in no wise assent to the contrary, if it be not by assent of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and Commons of the Realm, and that in full Parliament.

Manners by some of our Servants, to people of Holy Church, against [the Franchise of1] the Great Charter and the Establishments aforesaid, which Oppressions they shew in Petition, praying upon the same Remedy : Wherefore We, their Petition seen and regarded, and thereupon deliberation had with the Peers of our Realm, and other of our Council and of the Realm summoned to our said Parliament, and having regard to the Great Charter, and to other Statutes aforesaid, and at the request of the said Prelates and Clergy, which have much aided us, and daily do, by the assent and accord of the said Peers, and of all other summoned and being in our said Parliament, have granted and do grant for us and our Heirs and Successors, to the said Prelates and Clergy, the things underwritten perpetually to endure :

1 their Franchises

FIRST, That none by us, nor by other (*) Commis.sion of the Great Seal, nor of the Small, nor without Commission, shall take nothing of Com, Hay, Beasts, Carriage, nor other Goods of Archbishops, Bishops, Ab.bots, Priors, Abbesses, Prioresses, Parsons, Vicars, or of other People of Holy Church, (Õ) nor without, against the agreement and will of the Owners of the same Goods. And We do defend, that from henceforth no such Com.missions under the Great Seal, nor the Small, shall in anywise go forth for any Prises to be made : for We do take the said Prelates and Clergy, with their Possessions, Goods and Cattailes, into our especial Protection and Defence. Also we grant for us and our Heirs, that we shall not from henceforth charge any of the Prelates or Clergy, nor their Houses to receive [Guests,4] nor So.journers of Scotland, nor of other Country, nor our Horses nor Dogs, Falcons, nor other [Hawks1] of ours, nor others against their Gree and Will j Saving always to us the Services which be due to us of right, of them which owe to us the same Services, to sustain and re.ceive Dogs, Horses, or [Hawks.5]

ITEM, Because of the Temporalties being in our hands, or in the hands of our Ancestors, by reason of Archbishopricks, Bishopricks, or other Prelacies void, and also because of other lands, tenements, fees, and advowsons being in our hands and in the hands of our Ancestors, by nonage of Heirs, it hath been used before this time, that exception of Plenarty should hold no place against us, nor against any of our ances.tors, no more in case (6) such Presentments should be devolute to us in anotherÕs right, than if they had been in our own right, or in the right of our Crown, whereby many Parsons and Prebendaries were out of their Churches, Prebends, and Benefices, which they had long time holden, to their great mischief and impove.rishment : We will and grant for us and for our heirs, to avoid such mischiefs, that from henceforth we nor our heirs shall not make Collation or Presentment to any Church, Prebend, Chapel, or other Benefice, by the occasion of such Voidances of Prelacies, or of the lands of Infants within age, or of others, come or to come in our hands, or in the hands of our heirs, if we or our heirs do not make our Collations or Presentments within three years after that such Benefices do so of deed become void ; and that of such Churches and other Benefices, of which Clerks be in possession, and have had possession by a year before the making of this Statute, We nor our heirs shall have none action nor reason to present to such Benefices so full. And we will not that any man be holden to answer to any Writ of Quare Impedit taken in our name in such case, if the Collation or Presentment be not made within iii years after the Voidance as afore is said. And of such Voidances come in the time of our Ancestors, no Col.lation nor Presentment shall be from henceforth made by us nor by our heirs; but of any Aft ion to take of such Voidances we be wholly and quitely foreclosed.

ITEM, Because that in the petition of the said Prelates and Clergy it is contained, that Escheators and other Keepers, in the time of vacation of Archbi- shopricks, Bishopricks, and other Prelacies, have done great waste and destruftion in the same in time past; We will and grant for Us and for our Heirs, that at all times front henceforth, when such voidances shall happen, that our Escheators, and the Escheators of our Heirs, which for the Time shall be, shall enter, and cause to be well kept the said Voidances, without doing waste or destruction in the Manors, [Warrens,1] Parks, Ponds, or Woods; and that they se.ll no Un.derwood, nor hunt in the Parks or Warrens, nor fish in Ponds, nor free Fishings, nor shall rack nor take Fines of the Tenants, free nor bond; but shall keep and save as much as pertaineth to the said voidances, without [doing harm3] or any manner of oppression. And if the Dean and Chapter of Churches Cathedral, Priors, Subpriors, Prioresses, Subprioresses, and Co.vents of Prelacies, Abbies, or Priories, whose voidance pertaineth to us and our Heirs, will render to us and our Heirs the value of the said voidance, as other will reasonably yield, then the Chancellor and Treasurer shall have power to let (4) the said Dean and Chapter, Prior or Subprior, Prioress or Subprioress, and Covent, the said voidances by good and sufficient surety, so that they shall have the same before all other, yielding to Us the value of them, according as shall be found by Remem.brances of the Exchequer, or by Inquest to be taken upon the same, if need be, without making fine. And in case they will not accord to yield to the value, nor find such Surety, then the Chancellor and Treasurer shall cause to be ordained the good preservation of such voidances by Escheators, or other sufficient Keepers, to answer the King of that to him pertaineth reafonably, without doing waste or destru&ion, or other thing which may turn in disherison of the Churches whereof such voidances shall happen.

Statute the Second.

r l^DWARD by the Grace of God, &c.'] to the L JlL( Sheriff of Lincoln, Greeting. Whereas at our Parliament summoned at Westminster in the Quinzime of Easter last past, certain Articles expressly contrary to the Laws and Customs of our Realm of England, and to our Prerogatives and Rights Roval were pretended to be granted by Us by the manner of a Statute ; We, consider.ing how that by the Bond of our Oath we be tied to the observance and defence of such Laws, Customs, Rights, and Prerogatives, and providently willing to revoke (Õ) such things to [their own State,i'] which be so improvi- dently done, upon conference and treatise thereupon had with the Earls, Barons, and other wise Men of our said Realm, and because We never consented to the making of the said (4) Statute, but as then it behoved us, We dissimuled in the Premisses [by Protestations of Revo.cation !] of the said Statute, if indeed it should proceed, to eschew the dangers which by the denying of the same We feared to come, forasmuch as the said Parliament otherwise had been, without dispatching any thing, in discord dissolved, and so our earnest business had likely been ruinated, which God prohibit, and the said pre.tensed Statute We permitted then to be sealed: It seemed to the said Earls, Barons, and other wise Men, that sithence the said Statute did not of our free Will proceed, the same [be6] void, and ought not to have the name nor strength of a Statute ; and therefore by their Counsel and Assent We have decreed the said Statute to be void, and the same in as much as it proceeded of [Dread,7] We have agreed to be adnulled; willing nevertheless, That the Articles contained in the said pretensed Statute which by other of our Statutes, or of our Progenitors Kings of England, have been approved, shall, according to the form of the said [StatuteÕ] in every point, as con.venient is, be observed ; And the same We do, only to the Conservation and Reintegration of the Rights of our Crown, as We be bound, and not that We should in any wise grieve or oppress our Subjects, whom We desire to rule by lenity and gentleness. And therefore We do command thee, that all these things thou cause to be openly proclaimed in such Places within thy Bailiwick where thou shalt see expedient. Witness myself at Westminster the First Day of Oftober, the Fifteenth Year of our Reign.

IT is to be Remembered, that at the Parliament holden at Westminster, the Monday next after the Utas of the Holy Trinity, the year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord the King that now is of England the xviij. and of France the V. (') many Things were shewed in full Par.liament, which were attempted by the Party adversary to our Sovereign Lord the King, of France, against the Truce lately taken in Britaine, betwixt our said Sove.reign Lord the King and [him; Õ] and how that [he Ô] enforceth himself as much as he may, to destroy our said Sovereign Lord the King, and his Allies, Subjects, Lands, and Places, and the tongue of England ; and that was prayed by our said Soverign Lord the King of the Prelates, great Men, and Commons, that they would give him such Counsel and Aid, as should be expedient in so great necessity : And the said Prelates, great Men, and Commons, taking good deliberation and advice, and openly seeing the subversion of the Land of England, and the KingÕs great business, which God defend, if hasty remedy be not provided, have [concealedJ] jointly and severally, and prayed with great instance our Sove.reign Lord the King, that he would make him as strong as he might to pass the Sea, in assurance of the aid of God and of his good quarrel, effe&ually this time to make an end of his Wars, or by way of peace or else by force; and that (4) for Letters, Words, nor fair promises, he shall let his passage, till he see the effeft of his busi.ness ; and for this cause the said great Men do grant, to pass and to adventure them with him. And the said Commons do grant to him, for the same cause upon a certain form ii. Quinzimes of the Commonalty, and ii. Dismes of the Cities and Boroughs, to be levied in man.ner as the last Quinzime granted to him was levied, and not in other manner; and to be payed by ii. years, at the feasts of All Saints, and of Easter next following, for the first year; and [in that, thatJ] our Sovereign Lord the King doth pass the Sea, to pay at the same terms [to the Quinzime and Disme6] of the second year, and not in other manner ; so that the Money levied of the same, be dispended in the business shewed to them in this Parliament, by the advice of the great Men thereto assigned, and that the aids beyond Trent, be put in defence of the North. And our said Sovereign Lord the King, for this cause, and in ease of the said Com.mons, and of all his faithful Subjefts of England, by the assent of the Prelates, great Men, and Commons, hath granted of his good grace these things underwritten : FIRST, That the Commissions of the new Enquiries shall cease and be wholly adnulled, and that Writs be thereupon made of the Justices to surcease; Saving (7) the Indiftments of Felonies and Trespasses done against the Peace, of Wools carried out of the Realm, without paying Custom or Subsidy, and of other the KingÕs Goods, or of Money received or retained, by them which have had Commission under the KingÕs Seal, and also of

EDWARD by the Grace of God, [&c.'] Greeting.

Know Ye that at our Parliament holden at West.minster the Monday next after the Utas of the Holy Trinity, [theYear of our reign of England theEighteenth, and of France the Fifth,1] amongst other Things shewed, assented, and accorded in the said Parliament, there were shewed, assented, and accorded these Things under-written.

FIRST, Whereas many Things have been attempted, by the Party our Adversary of France, against the Truce late taken in Britaine, betwixt Us and Him, and how that he enforceth himself, as much as he may, to de.stroy Us, and our Allies, Subjects, Lands, and Places, and the Tongue of England: And thereupon We prayed the Prelates, Great Men, and the Commons, that they would give us such Counsel and Aid as should need in so great necessity; and the said Prelates, Great Men, and Commons, having thereof good deliberation and advice, and seeing openly the Subversion of the Land of England, and of our great Business, which God de.fend, if speedy Remedy be not provided; have coun.selled jointly and severally, and with great instance prayed Us, that in assurance of the Aid of God, and our good Quarrel, we should make Us as strong [as We might, to pass the Sea and3] by all the good means that We might, at this time to finish our Wars; and that for Letters, Words, nor fair Promises, we should not let our Passage, till We did see the Effeft of our Business: And for this Cause, the Great Men aforesaid granted to pass, and to adventure themselves with Us; and the said Prelates and Procurators of the Clergy, have granted to Us for the same Cause, a Triennial Disme, to be paid at certain Days, that is to say, of the Province of Canterbury, at the Feasts of the Purification of our Lady, and of Saint Bamabe the Apostle: And of the Province of York, at the Feasts of Saint Luke, and the Nativity of Saint John Baptist. And We for this Cause, in Maintenance of the Estate of Holy Church, and in Ease of the said Prelates, and all the Clergy of England, by Assent of the Great Men, and of the Com.mons, do grant of our good grace the Things under.written ; that is to say, that no Archbishop (4) shall be impeached before our Justices because of Crime, unless We especially do command them, till another Remedy be thereof ordained.

ITEM, If any Clerk be arraigned before our Justices at our Suit, or at the Suit of the Party, and the Clerk holdeth him to his Clergy, alledging that he ought not before them thereupon to answer; and if any Man for Us, or for the same Party, will suggest, that he hath married two Wives, or one Widow, that upon the same the Justices shall not have the Cognisance or Power to try the Bigamy by Inquest, or in other manner, but it shall be sent to the Spiritual Court, as hath been done in times past in case of Bastardy ; and till the Certificate be made by the Ordinary, the Party in whom the Bigamy is alleged, by the words aforesaid, or in other manner, shall abide in Prison; if he be not mainpernable.

ITEM, If Prelates, Clerks beneficed, or Religious People, which have purchased Lands, and the same have put to Mortmain, be impeached (5) upon the same before our Justices, and they shew our Charter of Li.cence, and Process thereupon made by an Inquest of Ad quod damnum, or of our Grace, or by Fine, they

p l^DWARD by the grace of God, Ac. to the Sheriff For the L E of Stafford,1] Greeting. Because that, by divers proclaiming Complaints made to Us, We have perceived that the Law the0rdlnince of the Land, which We by our Oath are bound to main- ,he KingÕs tain, is the less well kept and the Execution of the same Justices, disturbed many times by Maintenance and Procurement, as well in the Court as in the Country, (Õ); We, greatly moved of Conscience in this matter, and for this cause desiring as much for the pleasure of God, and ease and quietness of our Subjefts, as to save our Conscience, and for to save and keep our said Oath, by the assent of the great Men and other wise Men of our Council, [We have ordained these things following: First, We have I. commanded3] all our Justices, That they shall from JuÇticÇ shall henceforth do equal Law and Execution of right to all p^nt¡ our Subjefts, rich and poor, without having regard to without any Person, and without omitting to do right for any Regard of Letters or Commandment which may come to them from Letter* j Us, or from any other, or by any other cause; and if that any Letters, Writs, or Commandments come to the Justices, or to other deputed to do Law and Right

according to the usage of the Realm, in disturbance of the Law, or of the Execution of the same, or of (Õ) Right to the Parties, the Justices and other aforesaid shall pro.ceed and hold their Courts and Processes where the Pleas and Matters be depending before them, as if no such Letters, Writs, or Commandments were come to them; and they shall certify Us and our Council of such Com.mandments which be contrary to the Law, as afore is said. And to the Intent that our Justices should do even right to all People in the manner aforesaid, without more favour shewing to one than to another, We have ordained and caused our said Justices to be sworn, that they shall not from henceforth, as long as they shall be in the Office of Justice, take Fee nor Robe of any Man, but of Ourself, and that they shall take no Gift nor Re.ward by themselves, nor by other, privily nor apertly, of any Man that hath to do before them by any Way, except meat and drink, and that of small value; and that they shall give no Counsel to great Man or small, [in caseÒ] where We be party, or which do or may touch Us in any point, upon pain to be at our Will, Body, Lands, and Goods, to do thereof as shall please us, in case they do contrary; and for this Cause We have in.creased the Fees of the same our Justices in such manner as it ought reasonably to suffice them.

IN the same manner We have ordained in the right of the Barons of the Exchequer, and We have expressly charged them in our presence, That they shall do right and reason to all our Subjefts great and small; and that they shall deliver the People reasonably and with.out delay of the Business which they have to do before them, without undue tarrying as hath been done in times past.

ITEM, We have ordained, That all they which shall be Justices assigned by Commission to hear and deter.mine, and such as shall be associated to them, and also Justices of Assises to be taken in the Country, and of Gaol-delivery, and such as shall be [assigned and] as.sociated to them, shall make first [an Oath in certain Points, according as to them shall be enjoined by our CouncilJ] in our Chancery, before that any Commission be to them delivered.

ITEM, We have commanded and utterly defended, That none of our House, nor of them that be about us, nor other, which be towards our dear beloved Compa.nion the Queen, or our Son Prince of Wales, or towards our Courts, nor Prelates, Earls, Barons, nor other great nor small of the Land, of what Estate or Condition they be, shall not take in hand Quarrels other than their own, nor the same maintain by them nor by other, privily nor apertly, for Gift, Promise, Amity, Favour, Doubt, [nor Fear/] nor for none other Cause, in Dis.turbance of Law and Hindrance of Right, upon the Pains aforesaid ; but that every Man may be free to sue for and defend his Right in our Courts and elsewhere, according to the Law: And We have straitly commanded our said Son, and divers Earls and other great Men, being before us, that they on their behalf shall do to be kept this Ordinance without default; and that they suffer none which be [towards thems] (6) to attempt against this Ordinance by any way.

ITEM, Because We be informed, that many bearers and Maintainers of Quarrels and Parties in the Country be maintained and bome by Lords, whereby they be more encouraged to offend, and by Procurement co.vine and maintenance of such Bearers in the Country many People be disherited, and some delayed and dis.turbed of their Right, and some not guilty convidl and condemned or otherwise oppressed, in the undoing of their Estate, and in the notorious Destruction (7) of our People: We have commanded and do command, That all the great Men from henceforth shall void from their Retinue Fees and Robes all such Bearers and Maintainers in the Country, without shewing to them any Aid, Favour, or Comfort in any manner.

The Statute op Labourers.1

For malting Proclamation concerning Servants.

L

Who shall be bound to

The Rate of Wages fixed.

rTJ'DWARD by the Grace of God, &c. to the Reve- L Jl2j rend Father in Christ, William, by the same grace Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all Eng.land,1] Greeting. Because a great Part of the People, and especially of Workmen and Servants, late died of the Pestilence, many seeing the Necessity of Masters, and great Scarcity of Servants, will not serve unless they may receive excessive Wages, and some rather willing to beg in Idleness, than by Labour to get their Living; We, considering the grievous Incommodities, which of the lack especially of Ploughmen and such La.bourers may hereafter come, have upon deliberation and treaty with the Prelates and the Nobles, and Learned Men assisting Us, of their mutual counsel Ordained:

THAT every Man and Woman of our Realm of England, of what condition he be, free or bond, able in body, and within the age of threescore years, not ^rveTwhen living in Merchandize, nor exercising any Craft, nor required having of his own whereof he may live, nor proper Land, about whose Tillage he may himself occupy, and not serving any other, if he in convenient Service, his estate considered, be required to serve, he shall be bounden to serve him which so shall him require; and take only the Wages, Livery, Meed, or Salary, which were accustomed to be given in the places where he oweth to serve, the xx. year of our Reign of Eng.land, or five or six other common years next before.

Provided always, lhat the Lords be preferred before other in their Bondmen or their Land Tenants, so in their Service to be retained: so that nevertheless the said Lords shall retain no more than be necessary for them; and if any such Man or Woman, being so re- Persons quired to serve, will not the same do, that proved by two refusing to true Men before the Sheriff, [or the Bailiffs of our So- 8erve.Õ(hal* be vereign Lord the King, or the Constables5] of the Town lmpnsone where the same shall happen to be done, he shall anon be taken by them or any of them, and committed to the next Gaol, there to remain under strait keeping, till he find surety to serve in the form aforesaid.

ITEM, If any Reaper, Mower, or other Workman or Servant, of what estate or condition that he be, re.tained in any ManÕs Service, do depart from the said Service without reasonable Cause or Licence, before the Term agreed, he shall have Pain of Imprisonment.

And that none under the same Pain presume to receive or to retain any such in his Service.

ITEM, That no Man pay, or promise to pay, any Servant any more Wages, Liveries, Meed, or Salary The old than was wont, as afore is said ; nor that any in other WaSf5>and manner shall demand or receive the same, upon Pain of doubling of that, that so shall be paid, promised, required, or received, to him which thereof shall feel himself grieved, pursuing for the same; and if none such will pursue, then the same to be applied to any of the People that will pursue ; and such Pursuit shall be in the Court of the Lord of the Place where such Case shall happen.

ITEM, If the Lords of the Towns or Manors pre.sume in any Point to come against this present Ordi- Lords of nance either by them, or by their Servants, then Pursuit Xowns or shall be made against them in the Counties, Wapen- takes, Tithings, or such other Courts, for the Treble (hall fo rfeit Pain paid or promised by them or their Servants in the Treble Value, form aforesaid ; and if any before this present Ordi.nance hath covenanted with any so to serve for more Wages, he shall not be bound by reason of the same Covenant, to pay more than at another time was wont to be paid to such Person; nor upon the said Pain shall presume any more to pay.

ITEM, That Sadlers, Skinners, White-tawers, Cord- wainers, Taylors, Smiths, Carpenters, Masons, Tilers, [Shipwrights,'3 Carters, and all other Artificers and Workmen, shall not take for their Labour and Work.manship above the same that was wont to be paid to such Persons the said twentieth year, and other common years next before, as afore is said, in the Place where they shall happen to work ; and if any Man take more, he shall be committed to the next Gaol, in manner as afore is said.

ITEM, That Butchers, Fishmongers, [Regrators,1] Hostelers, Brewers, Bakers, Pulters, and all other Sellers of all manner of Visual, shall be bound to sell the same Vi&ual for a reasonable Price, having respeft to the Price that such Vi&ual be sold at in the Places ad.joining, so that the same Sellers have moderate Gains, and not excessive, reasonably to be required according to the distance of the Place from whence the said Victuals be carried ; and if any sell such Victuals in any other manner, and thereof be convict in the manner and form aforesaid, he shall pay the Double of the same that he so received, to the Party damnified, or, in Default of him, to any other that will pursue in this behalf: And the Mayors and Bailiffs of Cities, Bo.roughs, Merchant-Towns, and others, and of the [Ports of the Sea, and other Places,Õ] shall have Power to in.quire of all and singular which shall in any thing offend the same, and to levy the said Pain to the Use of them at whose Suit such Offenders shall be convift; and in case that the same Mayors and Bailiffs be neg.ligent in doing Execution of the Premises, and thereof be convict before our Justices, by Us to be assigned, then the same Mayors and Bailiffs $hall be compelled by the same Justices to pay the Treble of the Thing so sold to the Party damnified, or to any other in Default of him that will pursue; and nevertheless towards Us they shall be grievously punished.

ITEM, Because that many [valiant4] Beggars, as long as they may live of begging, do refuse to labour, giving themselves to Idleness and Vice, and sometime to Theft and other Abominations ; none upon the said Pain of Imprisonment shall, under the colour of Pity or Alms, give any thing to such, which may labour, or presume to favour them [towards their Desires,5] so that thereby they may be compelled to labour for their necessary Living.

Witness, 8cc. as before.

By the King himself and the whole Council.

Like Letters of Request are dire£led to the several Bishops of England, and to the Keeper of the Spiritualties of the Archbishoprick of Canterburv, during the Vacancy of the See, under the same date.

Wherefore our said Sovereign Lord the King, the xiiij. day of June, the xxiij. year of his Reign, hath commanded to all Sheriffs of England by divers Writs, that they shall do openly to be proclaimed and holden, all and singular the pre.mises in the Counties, Boroughs, Merchant Towns, Sea-ports, and other places in their Bailiwicks where to them shall seem expedient, and that they do thereof due execution, as afore is said.

Subsequently, our Sovereign Lord the King perceiving by the common complaint, that his People, for such excessive Stipend, Liveries and Prices, which to such Servants, La.bourers, and Workmen were constrainedly paid, be oppressed, and that the Disme and Quinzime to him attaining might not be paid, unless Remedy were therefore provided : Regard.ing also the Coaftions and manifest Extortions, and that there was no man which against such Offenders did pursue for the said Commodity so ordained to be obtained : Wherefore it was consonant, that that Thing which was ordained to be applied to singular Uses, seeing that the same Persons did not nor would not pursue, should be converted to a Publick and Com.mon Profit, by the Advice of his Counsel hath Ordained, That all and singular Workmen, Servants, and Artificers, as well Men as Women, of whatsoever estate or condition they be, taking moie for their Labours, Services, and Workman.ship than they were wont to take the said xx. year and other years aforesaid, should be assessed to the same Sum, which they shall receive over and above with other Sums, as well for the Time past, when the Stipend, Wages, Liveries and Prices were augmented, as for the Time then to come ; and that the said whole Sum received over and above, should be levied of every of them and gathered to the KingÕs Use, in Alleviation of every of the Towns whereof the said Artificers, Servants, and Labourers be, towards the Payments of the Sums cf the Disme and Quinzime yet running, whereunto the same Towns or People of the same were assessed. So that always, the same Disme and Quinzime ended, all the same Money, Liveries, and Prices, or the Value of the same Liveries, which, as afore is said, should be over and above received of them and every of them, should be levied and ga.thered by them whom the King will thereto assign, to the KingÕs Use, in Alleviation and Supportation of the Realm of England: And that they which for the same to serve, or the said Sums so by them over and above received, and before assessed, to pay, and their Crafts and Work to exercise, do refuse, they shall be incontinently arrested by the Taxers and Collectors of the said Disme and Quinzime, or any of them, (1) in every of the said Towns deputed to execute the premises, or hy the Bailiffs of the Places or Constables of the Towns, when they be thereof certified, and committed to the Gaol, there to remain till they have found Surety to serve, and shall pay that that they shall above receive, according to the same Ordi- mnees, or till the King shall some other Thing thereof demand- And always it is the Intent of the King and of his Counsel, that according to the first Ordinance, it should be lawful, and shall be lawful, to every Man to pursue against all exceeding the same, or not obeying to the same, and the thing recovered to be applied to his own Use. And therefore our said Sove.reign Lord the King hath commanded all Archbishops and Bishops that they do to be published the Premises in all Places of their Dioceses, commanding the Curates and other Sub.diocesans, that they compel their Parochians to labour, ac.cording to the Necessity of the Time, and also their Stipendiary Priests of their said Dioceses which do now excessively take, and will not, as it is said, serve for a competent Salary, [as hath been accustomed,1] upon Pain of Suspension and Inter- didlion : And that in no wise ye omit the same, as ye love Us and the Common Wealth of our Realm. Dated the day and year aforesaid.

Trial of Bastardy in auch Cases.

Statute the First.!

OUR Lord the King, at his Parliament holden at Westminster, at the Utas of the Purification of our Lady, the year of his Reign of England the Five and twentieth, and of France the Twelfth, considering the great Mischiefs and Damages which have happened to the People of his Realm of England, as well because that the Statutes ordained before this Time have not been holden and kept as they ought to be, as because of the mortal Pestilence that late reigned, and willing to provide for the Quietness and common Profit of his said People convenient Remedy; therefore by the Assent of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other great Men, and all the Commons of his said Realm summoned to the Parliament, hath ordained and established the Things underwritten, videlicet: Because that some People be m doubt if the Children bom in the Parts beyond the Sea, out of the Ligeance of England, should be able to demand any Inheritance within the same Ligeance, or not, whereof a Petition was put in the Parliament late holden at Westminster, the Seventeenth Year of the Reign of our Lord the King that now is, and was not at the same Time wholly assented; our Lord the King, willing that all Doubts and Ambiguities should be put away, and the Law in this Case declared and put in a Certainty, hath charged the said Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other wise Men of his Council, assembled in this Parliament, to deliberate upon this Point; all which of one assent have said, That the Law of the Crown of England is, and always hath been such, that the Chil.dren of the Kings of England, in whatsoever Parts they be bom, in England or elsewhere, be able and ought to bear the Inheritance after the death of their Ancestors; which Law our said Lord the King, the said Prelates Earls, Barons, and other great Men, and all the Com.mons assembled in this Parliament, do approve and affirm for ever. And in the Right of other Children born out of the Ligeance of England in the Time of our Lord the King, they be of one Mind accorded, that Henry Son of John de Beaumond, Elizabeth Daughter of Guy de Bryan, and Giles Son of Ralph Dawbeny, and other which the King will name, which were bom beyond the Sea, out of the Ligeance of England, shall be from henceforth able to have and enjoy their Inhe.ritance after the death of their Ancestors, in all Parts within the Ligeance of England, as well as those that should be bom within the same Ligeance. And that all Children Inheritors, which from henceforth shall be bom without the Ligeance of the King, whose Fathers and Mothers at the Time of their Birth be and shall be at the Faith and Ligeance of the King of England, shall have and enjoy the same Benefits and Advantages, to have and bear the Inheritance within the same Ligeance, as the other Inheritors aforesaid in Time to come ; so always, that the Mothers of such Children do pass the Sea by the Licence and Wills of their Husbands.

WHEREAS late in the Parliament of good Memory of Edward King of England, Grandfather to our Lord the King that now is, the [xxv'] Year of his Reign, holden at Carlisle, the Petition [heard, put before *] the said Grandfather and his Council in his said Parliament by the Commonalty of the said Realm, containing, That whereas the Holy Church of England was founded in the Estate of Prelacy, within the Realm of England, by the said Grandfather and his Progenitors, and the Earls, Barons, and other Nobles of his said Realm, and their Ancestors, to inform them and the People of the Law of God, and to make Hospitalities, Alms, and other Works of Charity, in the Places where the Churches were founded, for the Souls of the Founders, their Heirs, and all Christians; and certain Possessions, as well in Fees, Lands, Rents, as in Advowsons, which do extend to a great Value, were assigned by the said Founders to the Prelates and other People of the Holy Church of the said Realm, to sustain the same Charge, and especially of the Possessions which were assigned to Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Religious, and all other People of Holy Church, by the Kings of the said Realm, Earls, Barons, and other great Men of his Realm; the same Kings, Earls, Barons, and other Nobles, as Lords and Advowees, have had and ought to have the Custody of such Voidances, and the Presentments and the Collations of the Benefices being of such Prelacies: And the said Kings in Times past were wont to have the greatest Part of their Council, for the Safeguard of the Realm when they had need, of such Prelates and Clerks so advanced ; [the Bishop Õ] of Rome, accroch- ing to him the Seignories of such Possessions and Bene.fices doth give and grant the same Benefices to Aliens, which did never dwell in England, and to Cardinals, which might not dwell here, and to other as well Aliens as Denizens, as if he had been Patron or Advowee of the said Dignities and Benefices, as he was not of Right by the Law of England ; whereby if they should be suf.fered, there should scarcely be any Benefice within a short Time in the said Realm, but that it should be in the hands of Aliens and Denizens by virtue of such Pro.visions, against the good Will and Disposition of the Founders of the same Benefices ; and so the Eleftions of Archbishops, Bishops, and other Religious should fail, and the Alms, Hospitalities, and other Works of Cha.rity, which should be done in the said Places, should be withdrawn, the said Grandfather, and other Lay- Patrons, in the Time of such Voidances, should lose their Presentments, the said Council should perish, and Goods without Number should be carried out of the Realm, in Adnullation of the Estate of the Holy Church of England, and disherison of the said Grandfather, and the Earls, Barons, and other Nobles [of the said Realm,] and in Offence and Destruction of the Laws and Rights of his Realm, and to the great Damage of 1 five and thirtieth

And in case that Collation, Reservation, or Provision be made by the Court of Rome of any Church, Prebend, or other Benefices, which be of the Advowry of People of Holy Church, whereof the King is Advowee Para.mount immediate, that at the same Time of the Void- ance, at which Time the Collation, Reservation, or Pro.vision [ought to Õ] take Effeft as afore is said, the King and his Heirs thereof shall have the Presentment or Collation for that Time ; and so from Time to Time, whensoever such People of Holy Church shall be dis.turbed of their Presentments or Collations, by such Reservations, Collations, or Provisions, as afore is said ; saving to them the Right of their Advowsons and their Presentments, when no Collation or Provision of the Court of Rome is thereof made, (3) where that the said People of Holy Church shall or will to the same Bene.fices present or make Collation; and that their Presen.tees may enjoy the Effed of their Collations or Present.ments : And in the same Manner every other Lord, of what condition that he be, shall have the Collations or Presentments to the Houses of Religion which be of his Advowry, and other Benefices of Holy Church which be pertaining to the same Houses. And if such Advowees do not present to such Benefices within the half Year after such Voidances, nor the Bishop of the Place do not give the same by Lapse of Time within a Month after half a Year, that then the King shall have thereof the Presentments and Collations, as he hath of other of his own Advowry. And in case that the Presentees of the King, or the Presentees of other Patrons of Holy Church or of their Advowees, or they to whom the King, or such Patrons or Advowees aforesaid, have given Benefices per.taining to their Presentments or Collations, be disturbed by such Provisors, so that they may not have Possession of such Benefices by virtue of the Presentments or Col.lations to them made, or that they which be in Posses.sion of such Benefices be impeached upon their said Pos.sessions by such Provisors ; then the said Provisors, their Procurators, Executors, and Notaries, shall be attached by their Body, and brought in to answer; and if they be convict, they shall abide in Prison without being let to Mainprise, or Bail, or otherwise delivered, till that they have made Fine and Ransom to the King at his Will, and Gree to the Party that shall feel himself grieved.

AT the Parliament summoned at Westminster in the Feast of St. Hilary, the Year of the Reign of our

Corn shall

Tallies of the Goods taken.

Lord King Edward the Third [after the Conquest,J of England the Five and twentieth, and of France the Twelfth ; our said Lord the King, by the assent of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and of all the Commonalty of his Realm of England summoned to the Parliament, to the honour of God and Holy Church, and in Amend.ment of his said Realm, hath ordained and established the Things underwritten.

FIRST, Forasmuch as great and outrageous damage and grievance hath been done to the People by the Takers and Purveyors of Victuals, for the Houses of pu**eyora^ our Sovereign Lord the King, the Queen, and their by Meaiure Children ; It is accorded and assented in the said Parlia- striked ment, That the Takers (') of Corn for the said Houses Things taken shall take the same by Measure striked according as it by Purveyors is used through the Land. And that such Corn, Hay, sfla,i be , Litter, Bestall and all other Viftuals and Things, which *tP^he wry shall be taken for the said Houses, shall be [taken'] Value. by the very Value, by the Constable and other good People of the Towns where such Taking shall be made, without that that the Praisers by Menace or Duress shall be driven to set any other Price than their Oath will, and as commonly runneth in the next Markets.

And that betwixt the Purveyors and them whose Goods shali be taken in the presence of the Constables and Praisers, Tallies be made incontinently, without that that the People whose Goods shali be taken, shall be drawn or travelled elsewhere, and the same Tallies sealed with the Seals of the Takers of the Things so taken, by which Tallies Gree shall be made to them whose Goods shall be so taken ; and if any Purveyor or Taker for Punishment the said Houses, do in any other Manner, he shall be for undue f maintenant arrested by the Town where the Taking p"rT'rlnc* shall be made, and brought to the next Gaol; and it ^ c 3 he be thereof attainted, it shall be done of him as of a Thief, if the Quantity of the Goods the same require; according as in a Statute made in the Time of our So.vereign Lord the King that now is, the Fifth Year of his Reign, and in another Statute made in the Time of the King's Grandfather upon such Takings, is contained more at the full: and that from henceforth in the Commissions of such Takers and Purveyors, the Intent and Pain limited in this Statute shall be contained: and that no Commission be made, but only under the PurveyorsÕ

KingÕs great Seal or Privy Seal; nor that no Man be bender bound to obey [any such Commissions, other or in what Õkt Qrnt or Manner 4J than is aforesaid; and that the same Statute priry Sell, take place in all Points against every Taker and Pur.veyor of every Manner of Victual in every part of the Realm, of what Condition soever he be.

ITEM, Whereas divers Opinions have been before II. this Time [in what Case Treason shall be said, and in Declaration what not;s] the King, at the Request of the Lords and J^br ªCM of the Commons, hath made a Declaration in the Man- adjudged ner as hereafter followeth, that is to say; When a Man Treason.

And if percase any Man of this Realm ride armed [covertly"] or secretly with Men of Arms against any other, to slay him, or rob him, or take him, or retain him till he hath made Fine or Ran.som for to have his Deliverance, it is not the Mind of the King nor his Council, that in such Case it shall be judged Treason, but shall be judged Felony or Trespass, according to the Laws of the Land of old Time used, and according as the Case requireth. And if in such Case, or other like, before this Time any Justices have judged Treason, and for this Cause the Lands and Te.nements have comen into the KingÕs hands as Forfeit, the chief Lords of the Fee shall have the Escheats of the Tenements holden of them, whether that the same Tenements be in the KingÕs hands, or in others, by Gift or in other Maimer; Saving always to our Lord the King the Year, and the Waste, and the Forfeitures of Chattels, which pertain to him in the Cases above named; and that [the Writs"] of Scire facias be granted in such Case against the Land-tenants, without other Original, and without allowing [any Proteftion 15] in the said Suit; and that of the Lands which be in the KingÕs hands, Writs be granted to the Sheriffs of the Counties where the Lands be, to deliver them out of the KingÕs hands without Delay.

ITEM, It is accorded, That no Indiftor shall be put in Inquests upon Deliverance of the Indi&ees of Felonies or Trespass, if he be challenged for that same cause by him which is so indidled.

a conveniable Remedy might be thereof ordained, to the Reverence of God and of Holy Church ; by the Assent of his Parliament, for him and his Heirs, willeth and granteth the Points underwritten.

FIRST, That all the Privileges and Franchises granted heretofore to the said Clergy be confirmed and holden in all Points. And as touching Presentments to be made by our Lord the King, or any of his Heirs, to a Benefice of Holy Church in anotherÕs Right by old Title, our said Lord the King, to the Honour of God and Holy Church, willeth and granteth, of the Assent of the said Parliament, that from henceforth he nor any of his Heirs shall not take Title to present to any Bene.fice in any otherÕs Right of any Time of his Progenitors; nor that any Prelate of his Realm be bound to receive any such Presentment to be made, nor to do thereof any Execution; nor that any Justice of the one Place, or the other, may not nor ought not to hold Plea, or give Judgement upon any such Presentment to be made; but that the said King and his Heirs be for ever here.after clearly barred of all such Presentments ; saving always to him and his Heirs all such Presentments in anotherÕs Right [fallen, or to fall,1} of all his Time, and of the Time to come.

AND, Because in the Parliament holden at West.minster the Fourteenth Year of the Reign of our Lord the King that now is, amongst other Things then granted to the Prelates of Holy Church, it was ordained, That the King should not take Title to present to any Bene.fice in anotherÕs Right, but of the Voidances which shall happen of such Benefices within Three Years next before his Presentment, which Thing seemeth very pre.judicial to the King and his Heirs; It is accorded in this present Parliament, That the said Ordinance, as to this Point, shall be holden for none ; but nevertheless, that all the other Articles contained in the said Ordi.nance, and [GrantÕ] then made to Holy Church shall stand in their Force.

ITEM, Whereas before this Time our Lord the King hath taken Title to present to Benefices at the Sugges.tion of many Clerks, where the Title hath not been true, and by such Presentments and Judgements there.upon given, the Clerks have been received by the Or.dinaries of the Places, against God and good Faith, and in Depression of them which had good and true Title to the said Benefices ; now the King will and granteth, That at what Time he shall [take Õ] Collation or Present.ment from henceforth to any Benefice in anotherÕs Right, that the Title whereupon he groundeth himself shall be well examined that it be true ; and at what Time before Judgement (Õ) the Title be found by good Information untrue or unjust, the Collation or Presentment thereof made, shall be repealed; and the Patron, or the Pos.sessor, which shall shew and prove the false Title, shall have thereupon Writs out of the Chancery as many as to him shall be needful.

ITEM, Whereas the said Prelates have grievously complained, praying thereof Remedy, for that secular Clerks, as well Chaplains as other Monks, and other People of Religion, have been drawn and hanged by Award of the secular Justices, in Prejudice of the Fran.chises of Holy Church, and in Oppression of the Juris.diction thereof; It is accorded and granted by the said King in his Parliament, That all Manner of Clerks, as well secular as religious, which shall be from henceforth convift before the secular Justices aforesaid, for any Treasons or Felonies touching other Persons than the King himself, or his Royal Majesty, shall from hence.forth freely have and enjoy the Privilege of Holy Church, and shall be without any Impeachment or Delay de.livered to the Ordinaries demanding them. And for this Grant the said Archbishop promiseth to our Lord the King, that upon the Punishment and safe keeping of such Clerks Offenders, which so shall be delivered to the Ordinaries, he shall thereof make a convenient Ordinance, whereby they shall be safely kept and duly punished, so that no Clerk shall take Courage to offend for Default of Correction.

ITEM, Although that Clerks arraigned of Felony before secular Justices, which challenged their Clergy, and were demanded by the Ordinary of the Place, have been often before this Time remanded to the Gaol by the said Justices, surmising to them, that other Ihings be to be said against them ; nevertheless because the com.mon Law is, That a Clerk in such Case ought not to be remanded to the Gaol, but ought to be presently ar.raigned of all, or otherwise delivered to the Ordinary ; It is accorded, l hat this Point be kept by all manner of Justices and Judges secular throughout our Realm.

ITEM, Because the Temporalties of Archbishops and Bishops have been oftentimes taken into the King s Hands for Contempts done to him upon Writs of Quare non admisit, and likewise for divers other Causes, whereof the said Prelates have prayed the King, that no such Taking shall from henceforth be made, sith they be Peers of the Land ; the King will and granteth, in the same Parliament, That all the Justices which from henceforth shall give Judgement against any Prelate of the Land in such Case, or the like, that they in such Case may freely receive, and from henceforth shall receive for the Contempt so judged, a reasonable Fine of the Party so condemned, according to the Quantity of the Trespass, and after the Quality of the Contempt, incontinently at the Time of the Judgement, if the Party offer the same, or otherwise after the Judgement, at what Time the Party will offer himself; and if it need, the Chancellor and the Treasurer shall be called to the Receipt of the said Fines.

ITEM, Because that many Presentments to divers Benefices of Holy Church, as well of the Patronage of Lay People, as of People of Holy Church, which were void by Six Months, whereof the Collation of such Be.nefices by Lapse of Time was devolute, and of Right pertaining to the Ordinaries of the Places, were reco.vered by the King by Judgements thereof given of the Assent of the said Patrons, in Deceit of the said Col.lations so made reasonably by the said Ordinaries ; in which Pleas (Ô) the Ordinaries nor their Clerks, to whom they did give such Benefices, were not received to shew nor defend their Right in this Behalf, [nor to counterplead the KingÕs Right so claimed,1] which if not reasonable ; Wherefore the King, by the Assent ol the said Parliament, will and granteth for him and his Heirs, That when Archbishops, Bishops, or other Or.dinaries, have given a Benefice of Right devolute to him by Lapse of Time, and after the King presenteth and taketh the Suit against the Patron, which percase will suffer that the King shall recover without Adlion tried, in deceit of the Ordinary, or the Possessor of the said Benefices, that in such Case, and in all other Cases like, where the KingÕs Right is not tried, the Arch.bishop or Bishop, Ordinary or Possessor, shall be re.ceived to counterplead the Title taken for the King, and to have his Answer, and to shew and defend his Right upon the Matter, although that he claim nothing in the Patronage in the Case aforesaid.

ITEM, Whereas the said Prelates have shewed and prayed Remedy, for that the secular Justices do accroch to them Cognisance of Voidance of Benefices of Right, which Cognisance and the discus-ing thereof pertaineth to the Judges of Holy Church, and not to the Lay Judge; The King will and granteth, That the said Justices shall from henceforth receive such Challenges made or to be made by any Prelate of Holy Church in this Behalf, and moreover thereof shall do Right and Reason.

ITEM, Because that the KingÕs Justices do take In- duftments of Ordinaries, and of their Ministers, of Extortions and Oppressions, and impeach them, with.out putting in certain, wherein or whereof, or in what Manner they have done Extortion ; The King will, That his Justices shall not from henceforth impeach the Ordinaries, nor their Ministers, because of such Indid- ments of general Extortions or Oppressions, unless they say, and put m certain, in what Thing, and of what, and in what Manner the said Ordinaries or their Ministers have done Extortions or Oppressions.

THE KING to All to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting. Whereas in our last Parliament holden at West.minster in the Feast of Saint Hilary last past, among other Petitions and Articles exhibited in the same Parliament by the Honourable Father in God Simon Archbishop of Canter.bury, for himself and his brethren the Bishops of his Pro.vince, concerning certain Grievances which they alledged to be done to Holy Church against the Privileges thereof, it was claimed on the part of the said Clergy, that all Clerks con.victed of having falsified or counterfeited our Money, or our Great or Privy Seals, ought to enjoy the Privilege of Holy Church, and that the Church had been in possession of such : We, by reason that we cannot, for other great Businesses, attend to the Discussion of this Point, willing as well to preserve the Estate of Holy Church as our own, do will and grant, that this Article be put in suspense until our next Parliament, in the which the Point may be more fully dis.cussed, and the Truth thereof tried: and that, if in the mean time any Clerk be conviCt of having falsified or counter.feited the Money of the Land, or either of our Seals aforesaid, he shall not for the Time be put to death by Award of the Secular Judge, but be remanded to Prison, there to remain in safe Custody without making any Deliverance to the Ordi.nary, until it be otherwise ordained therein.

In Witness whereof We have caused these our Letters Patents to be made. Given at Westminster the Twentieth day of February, in the Twenty-sixth year of our reign of England, and of France the Thirteenth.

Statute the First.

OUR Lord the King, by the Assent and (Õ) Prayer of the Great Men, and the Commons of his Realm of England, at his great Council holden at West.minster, the Monday next after the Feast of St. Matthew the Apostle, the Twenty-seventh Year of his Reign of England, and of France the Fourteenth, in Amendment of his said Realm, and Maintenance of the Laws and Usages (Õ) hath ordained and established these Things underwritten.

FIRST, Because it is shewed to our Lord the King, by the grievous and clamorous Complaints of the Great Men and Commons aforesaid, how that divers of the People be, and have been drawn out of the Realm to answer of Things, whereof the Cognisance pertaineth to the KingÕs Court; and also that the Judgements given in the same Court be impeached in [another Court,3] in Prejudice and Disherison of our Lord the King, and of his Crown, and of all the People of his said Realm, and to the undoing and Destru&ion of the Common Law of the same Realm at all l imes used: Whereupon, good Deliberation had with the Great Men and other of his said Council, It is assented and accorded by our Lord the King, and the Great Men and Commons aforesaid, That all the People of the KingÕs Ligeance of what Condition that they be, which shall draw any out of the Realm in Plea, whereof the Cognisance pertaineth to the KingÕs Court, or of Things whereof Judgements be given in the King's Court, or which do sue in [any other Court,4] to defeat or impeach the Judgements given in the KingÕs Court, shall have a Day containing the Space ofTwo Months, by Warning to be made to them in the Place where the Possessions be, which be in Debate, or otherwise where they have Lands or other Possessions, by the Sheriffs or other the KingÕs Ministers, to appear before the King and his Council, or in his Chancery, or before the KingÕs Justices in his Places of the one Bench or the other, or before other the KingÕs Justices which to the same shall be deputed, to answer in their proper Persons to the King, of the Contempt done in this Behalf; and if they come not at the said Day in their proper Person to be at the Law, they, their Procurators, Attornies, Executors, Notaries, and Maintainors, shall from that Day forth be put out of the KingÕs Protection, and their Lands, Goods, and Chattels forfeit to the King, and their Bodies, wheresoever they may be found, shall be taken and imprisoned, and ransomed at the KingÕs Will: And upon the same a Writ shall be made to take them by their Bodies, and to seize their Lands, Goods, and Possessions into the KingÕs Hands; and if it be returned that they be not found, they shall be put in Exigent, and outlawed.

Provided always, That at what Time they come before they be outlawed, and will yield them to the KingÕs Prison to be justified by the Law, and to receive that which the Court shall award in this Behalf, that they shall be thereto received ; the Forfeiture of the Lands, Goods, and Chattels abiding in their Force, if they do not yield them within the said Two Months, as afore is said.

All Subjeftj suing in a Foreign Court for Matter* cognizable in the King** Court, or questioning elsewhere the Judgement* of the King'* Court, shall have Two Months* warning to answer for such Contempt.

IV

The KingÕs Release o( such Forfeitures.

Cloths under the Assise shall be allowed for in Price.

AulnegerÕs Fee for every Cloth and half Cloth sold.

A Subsidy granted lo the King of every Cloth.

ITEM, Because our Lord the King hath often granted Charters of Pardon of Felonies upon feigned and untrue Suggestions of divers People, whereof much Evil hath chanced in Times past, and for to eschue such Evil, It is accorded and assented by our said Lord the King, and all the said Council, That from henceforth in every Charter of Pardon of Felony, which shall be granted at any ManÕs Suggestion, the Õ said Suggestion, and the Name of him that maketh the Suggestion, shall be com.prised in the same Charter; and if after, the same Sug.gestion be found untrue, the Charter shall be disallowed and holden for none: And the Justices before whom such Charters shall be alledged, shall enquire of the same Suggestion, and that as well of Charters granted before this Time, as of Charters which shall be granted in Time to come ; and if they find them untrue, then they shall disallow the Charters so alledged, and shall moreover do as the Law demandeth.

ITEM, For the great and outrageous Dearth of Victuals, which Hostlers [Herbingers,'] and other Re- grators of Victuals make through the Realm, to the great Damage of the People passing through the Realm : It is accorded and established, That [the Justices *] learned in the Law, which be good and convenient, shall be newly chosen to enquire of the Deeds and Outrages of such Hostlers, Regrators, Labourers, and all other com.prised in the Statute another Time thereof made, and them to punish, and moreover to do right to the King and his People : Saving always to every Lord and other, their Franchises in all Points.

ITEM, Whereas the Great Men and Commons have shewed to our Lord the King, how divers Merchants, as well Foreigners as Denizens, have withdrawn them, and yet do withdraw them to come with Cloths into England, to the great Damage of the King and of all his People, because that the KingÕs Aulneger surmiseth to Merchant Strangers, that their Cloths be not of Assise, that is to say, The coloured Cloth of the Length of Six and twenty Yards measured by the [Crest,3] and of the Breadth of Six Quarters and an Half; and the Cloth of Ray, of the Length of Eight and twenty Yards measured by the List, and of the Breadth of Six Quarters, and [whereas the same have been arrested4] as forfeit to our Lord the King; (5) they have prayed our said Lord the King, that it may please him to release and put out such Forfeitures in Ease of his People, for a convenient Recompence to be made to him [of the other Party ;6^] Our Lord the King, upon such Condition hearing their Supplication, hath released and [excluded him of7] all the said Forfeitures, and he willeth and granteth for him and for his Heirs, that there shall be no Cloths forfeit, although they be not of the same Assise ; but the KingÕs Aulneger shall measure the Cloth, and mark the same, by which Mark a Man may know how much the Cloth containeth ; and of as much as the Cloth which is bought for Cloth of Assise, shall be found less than the Assise, Allowance or Abatement shall be made to the Buyer in the Payment which he shall make for the same Cloth, after the Quantity of the Price for which the Cloth was bought; And the Aulneger shall take for every Cloth so mea.sured, which is of Assise, that is to say, of the Seller an Halfpenny, and of Half a Cloth a Farthing, for his Office, and no more; nor they shall take nothing of the Cloths which be less than [of the Half Cloth ;*] and that he nothing meddle of the Aulnage of any Cloth, but only of Cloths which are to be sold : And for so much the said Lords and Commons have granted to the King a Subsidy of every Cloth which is to be sold, to take of the Seller over the Customs thereof due, that is to say ; Of every Cloth of the said Assise, wherein there is no Grain, iv. d. and of every Half such Cloth, ii. d. and of every Cloth of Assise of Scarlet, vi. d. and of every Half such Cloth, iiid. and of every Cloth Half Grain of Assise, v. d. and of every Half such Cloth ii d. ob. And that (9) every Cloth passing the Half Cloth of Assise by Three Yards and more, which is no Cloth whole of Assise, and also of every Cloth passing the

FORASMUCH as the Staple is now of late ordained to abide perpetually in England, and at the be.ginning there was no Evidence in certain, by which a Man might assign or limit in certain that that the Mayors and Constables, in the Places where the Staples be ordained, ought to take by Year in certain for their Travail; but it was then assented by the Lords and Commons, That of every Sack should be levied, eight- pence for the first Year, and delivered to the said Mayor and Constables, in the Places where the said Staples be assigned, which first Year passed out at the Gule of August last past: And now comeih as much

Wools, or well nigh as much, to the Port of London, as do in all the other Staples through the Realm, and to some of the other Staples cometh as much of Wools, as to Two or Three of the other Staples, so that to one Staple cometh more, and to another less, so that the Mayor and Constables of some Places take too much, and in other Places too little, and the People be very much charged to pay Eight-pence of a Sack, as afore is said, having regard to the Sum of the Wools that passeth over the Sea : And all the Time that the said Staple was abiding beyond the Sea, he that [is1J chosen Mayor by the Merchants of England, did take a certain

Of the Sumi

to be paid to the Mayors & Constables of the Staples for their Services.

* These Titles are from the Printed Copies and Translations; some of which ascribe this Ordinance to the 28th year of this Reign: It is not inserted in Rot. Ord. 27 Edw. Ill : It was printed, in CayÕs Edition of the Statutes, from MS. Reg. 19 A. XIV; and there is also a Copy in MS. Cott. Nero C.I j as of 27 Edw. III.

by the year; and also it were Reason that it should be so in England, and that in a reasonable manner, every Man according to his Travail, and that the People should not be so much charged: Wherefore It is ordained by the King and the great Men, and by the Advice of all the Council, That no more shall be levied of a Sack but four-pence in no [Part'] from the gule of August last past hitherto, nor from henceforth (*). And that the four-pence of the Sack, in every Place where the Staple is, shall be put in a Box, and sealed with the Seals of the Mayor and Constables, to the Intent that the said Mayor and Constables may be thereof paid of their certain, that they shall take ; and if, at the End of the Year, more be found in the Box than the Fees of the said Mayor and Constables shall amount unto, it shall be safely kept, to pay and [perform Õ] the Fees of the Mayors and Constables in other Staples, where the iiii. d. will not thereto suffice; and if any Thing remain in the said Boxes after the Fees paid, the same Sum Residue shall be saved to the common Profit of the Merchants of the Staple for the Year to come, and for to pay for the Weights made of New, and also for [Payments 4] and other Things necessary touching the Staple. And as much as is levied, in all the Places where the Staples be, over the said Sum of iiii d. of the Sack, after the said Gule of August last past, shall be rebailed and restored to the Uses aforesaid. And the Fees of the Mayor and Constables be ordained and limited in the Form as followeth, that is to say; The Mayor of the Staple of Westminster shall take C. li. (s) and every of the Constables there ten Marks. The Mayor of York, Kingston upon Hull, Norwich, and Winches.ter, every of them xx. li. and every of the Constables of the said Places aC.s; The Mayor of Newcastle upon Tine, Chichester, and of Exeter, x. li. and every of the Constables of those Places, five Marks. And if any of the Mayors and Constables above named, (6) refuse the Office, he shall pay to the Company as much as his Fee shall amount to (7). And Proclamation of the same was made through England the Sixth Day, &c.

And It was commanded to the Mayor and Constables of the Staple of Westminster, that the Ordinance aforesaid, and all and singular the Things in the same contained, in the Staple aforesaid they do cause to be proclaimed and firmly holden. Witness the King at Westminster, the Sixth day of November.

By the King himself and the Council.

In the same Manner it was commanded to the Mayors and Constables of the several Staples throughout England.

And It was commanded to the Sheriff of York, that the Ordinance aforesaid, and all and singular the Things in the same contained, in the Places in his Bailiwick, as well within Liberties as without, where he should see meet, he should cause to be publickly proclaimed and firmly holden. Witness as above.

In the same Manner it was commanded to the several Sheriffs throughout England.

In the same Manner it was commanded to the underwritten, under the same Date, viz.

ITEM, Because that great Clamour and grievous Inere^0f Complaints be made, as well by Aliens as by Denizens, Murdert uul that Merchants and other passing through the Realm of ttobbrne*. England with their Merchandises and other Goods, be slain and robbed, and namely now more than they were wont, whereof Remedy hath not been made to the [Complaints ;'] Our Lord the King, considering the Profit which may come to the said Realm by coming and abiding of the said Merchants Aliens in the same Realm, and the Damage and Mischief which to them and other is done daily by such Manslaughters and Robberies, and willing to provide for the Surety and Indempnity of Merchants and other aforesaid, hath ordained and. esta.blished, by the Assent of all his Parliament, to the Intent that Merchants Aliens shall have the greater Will and Courage to come into the said Realm of England^ [and !] that Remedy from henceforth be speedily made to such Merchants and other robbed, according to the Form Confirmation contained in the Statute late made at Winchester; that *nd Al"tnd- is to say, that solemn [CryJ] be made in all Counties, gunne of' Hundreds, Markets, Fairs, and all other Places where Wincbritcr, [solemn Assembly *] of the People shall be, so that none 13 Edw, I. by Ignorance shall excuse him, that every Country from ct,aPter *È *¥ henceforth be so kept, that immediately after Felonies and Robberies done, fresh Suit be made from Town to Town, and from Country to Country ; and Inquest, if need be, shall be also taken in the Towns by him which is Sovereign of the Town, and after in Hundreds,

Franchises, and in the County, and some time in Two,

Three, or Four Counties, in case when Felonies shall be done in the Marches of the Counties, so that the Offenders may be attainted. And if the Country do not answer of such Offenders, the Pain shall be such, that every Country, that is to say, the People dwelling in the Country, shall answer of the Robberies done, and of the Damages; so that all the Hundred where the Robbery shall be done, [or SJ the Franchises which be within the Precinft of the same Hundred, shall answer of the Robbery done; and if the Robbery be done in the Division of two Hundreds, both Hundreds shall answer together with the Franchises: And longer Term shall not the Country have after the Robbery or Felony done, than Forty Days; within which them behoveth to [make Gree of6] the Robbery, or of the Offence, or that they answer of the Bodies of the Offenders.

ITEM, for that the mean People of the Realm, and XII. divers others have complained of the grievances done to them, because the Purveyors of our Lord the King, (*) the Queen, and of the Prince, and of other, have taken of them their Goods, [Livings *] and Viffuals, and thereof have delivered them Tallies, assigning to them a day and place to receive their Payment at foreign places and far off, where they dispensed the value of the thing so taken of them, or the double, before that they have received their Payment, and oftentimes have failed of all; the King willing to provide a remedy against such Grievances, hath ordained and established, for Purveyance* the quietness and ease of his People, that of all ,0 KingÕ* Purveyances which be or shall be made to his use, or lindcr to any others use, within the Sum of Twenty Shillings,

Statute the Second.

FORASMUCH as the Commons of the Realm of England, at the Parliament holden at Westminster, the Monday next after the Week of Easter, the Year of the Reign of our [Lord the King, Edward the Third1] of England xxxi, and of France xviii, have complained them to our Lord the King, because that the People of Great Yarmouth do encounter the Fishers bringing Herring to the said Town in the Time of the Fair, and do buy and forestall the Herring before they do come to the Town ; and also the Hostelers of the same Town, that lodge the Fishers coming thither with their Herring, will not suffer the said Fishers to sell their said Herring, nor meddle with the Sale thereof, but sell them at their own Will as dear as they will, and give to the Fishers that (2) pleaseth them, whereby the Fishers do withdraw themselves to come thither; and so is the Herring set at much greater Price than ever it was, to the great Damage of our Lord the King, of the Lords, and of all the People: Wherefore our Lord the King, seeing the Mischiefs in this Behalf, by the Assent of the Great Men and all the Commons, hath ordained and stablished Remedy upon the said Mischiefs, in the Form as followeth.

Statute the Third.

XT/ÕHERE AS it is shewn to our Lord the King by the Õ ' Commons of his Realm of England, in his Parliament holden at Westminster, the Monday next after the Week of Easter, in the Year of the Reign of our Lord the King, that is to say, of England the One-and-thirtieth, and of France the Eighteenth, that Salt-Fish of Blakeney and of the Coasts adjoining, are, and heretofore have been sold at too high and excessive price, to the great Damage of our Lord the King, of the great Men, and of all the People of the said Realm ; whereof the said Commons do pray a Remedy ; Our Lord the King, desiring to make Amendment therein, for Relief of his People, and by Assent of the Prelates and other great Men and Commons, hath ordained and established concerning the Sale of the said Fish, in Manner following.

FIRST, [It is ordained,] That all the Ships called Doggers and Lodeships, pertaining to the Haven of Blackney, and Coasts thereunto adjoining, that is to say, [the Suyter, the Wyneton,1 ] Clay, Salthouse, Shiring- ham, and C.rowmer, shall deliver [or Õ] discharge their Fish within the Haven of Blackney only, betwixt Benord and Hogfleet, and in none other Place, upon Pain of Imprisonment at the KingÕs Will, and Forfeiture of the same Fish. And that no Fish be delivered nor carried out of the Ship to any House, nor elsewhere, before that the Owner of the Ship, wherein the said Fish is charged, and the Merchant that shall buy the Fish, be agreed of the Price of the same, by clear Day.

ITEM, That no Fisher nor Owner of any Ship, nor any other, set Hand upon any Fish within the Ship, for to try, choose, or impair the Fish, but only the Buyer or his Attorney, upon the said Pain. And that no Fish called Loych-fish shall be chosen or tried, but only

Suylerley, JViveton.

And also by the Advice of the Merchants and Buyers of the Owners coming to the Fair of Black- ne" and of the Owners of the Ships, a Price shall be set at the Beginning, and assessed upon the Dogger- fish and Loych-fish, before that any Sale be made, which Price shall be holden during the Fair; and that the said Fish be sold at such a Price openly, and not by Covin privily : And that no Owner of Ships, Mari.ners, nor other, lodge, nor cause to be lodged in their Houses privily nor openly, Fish in the [Mud,3] nor Fish [searched,4] for to sell again another Time at Retale, but all such Fish shall be sold reasonably within the said Bounds at the [Fair3] and Price aforesaid, upon the same Pain.

And that there shall be no Deliverance made of the said Fish, but in the Presence of Six Men chosen thereto, by the good Men of the Towns of Suyterley, Wyveton, Clayc, Salthous, and Shiryngham, and the Owners and Masters of Ships and the Merchants ; which six Men, five, four, three, or two of them at the least, shall be always present with the Owners and Masters of Ships, and the Merchants to make every Delivery ; and the said six chosen Men shall be sworn, well and faith.fully to search if any Orgeys be found concealed, beyond the Score which the Masters and Mariners shall have in the Hun.dred as above is said ; and if more Orgeys be found con.cealed, they shall forthwith be arrested by the said chosen Men then present, and forfeited unto our Lord the King.

And that no Owner of a Ship, Mariner, nor other, make Impeachment, nor be resistant in any Point against this present Ordinance ; nor that no Mariner nor Fisher, because of this Ordinance, leave or refuse to go [in 6] fishing, as before Times they were wont to do, nor disturb any Covenant made between a Merchant and Owner of a Ship, upon Pain of Imprisonment, and to be ransomed at the KingÕs Will; and that upon the same a Writ be sent to the Sheriff of Norfolk, that at every ManÕs Complaint that will sue for the King, or for himself, against those that in any Point offend against this Ordinance, he shall cause the same Resisters and Trespassers to be attached, and them detain in Prison till the King and his Council have ordained of them that Right requireth, after the Quantity of their Trespass.

Statute the Fourth.

THE King to the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, to our Officers both great and small, and to All other our faithful Subjc&s whomsoever, of our Land of Ireland, unto whom these Presents shall come Greeting. Whereas from the frequent Information of trust-worthy Persons, We have learnt that our Land of Ireland, and the Church of Ireland, and the Clergy and People thereof subjeft to Us, through Default of good Government and the Neglefl and Carelessness of the Royal Officers there, both great and small, have been hitherto manifoldly disturbed and grieved; and the Marches of the said Land situate near the Enemy, have been laid waste by Hostile Invasions, the Marchers being slain and plundered, and their Dwellings horribly burnt, and others compelled to desert their proper Homes, some of them flying unto the Enemy, and others to strange Places 5 and divers Parts of the said Marches being thus desolate and deserted have been occupied by the Enemy; and the Affairs of Us and the said Land improperly and uselessly carried on, the Laws and approved Customs not duly observed, our People in divers Manners spoiled of their Goods and Property, against Justice, Law, and the Form of the Statutes thereof made ; and our Peace broken and ill kept, and Traitors, Thieves, and Malefaftors not punished as they ought to be : By occasion of which Evils and others, greater Damages irreparable, which God forbid, are feared to happen, unless apt Remedies be opposed to the Premises: We desiring to provide for the good Government and Quiet of the same Land and People, have thereupon, by Assent of our Council, determined that the Matters following shall be ordained and stedfastly observed :

First, We will and command that the Holy Church of Ireland shall have her Liberties and free Customs inviolable, and shall freely enjoy and use the same.

Also We will and command that the Affairs of Us and the Land, those especially which be great and arduous, shall, in Councils, by our sage Counsellors and the Prelates and Great Men, and certain of the more discreet and lawful Men of the Parts adjoining where those Councils shall happen to be holden, for this Cause to be called forth, but in Par.liaments by those our Counsellors, and the Prelates, and Nobles, and others in the Land aforesaid, as the Custom requireth, according to Justice, Law, Custom and Reason, be treated and managed ; and faithfully, without Fear, Favour, Hatred, or Reward, be discussed and also determined.

Also Whereas the Justices and certain others who have been heretofore our Officers of our said Land, led by the Counsels of their private Counsellors, not ours, let us not say of Brocagers, have occasioned innumerable Wrongs as well to Us as to singular other Persons, applying their Gains un.lawfully acquired in that behalf to their own Use, not ours ; We will and command that our said Officers, the greater chiefly, shall not keep in their Service such Counsellors as aforesaid that are Brocagers, more especially those defamed of such Brocages, who have heretofore belonged to such Chief Ministers ; and if they should have retained any, they shall forthwith put them away; that the Affairs of Us and the Land, be not obstrufted by the said Brocagers; nor the Profits to Us appertaining be not carried away from Us through the Means of their feigned Counsels ; And if such private Counsellors, which God forbid, being retained among the followers of those our Ministers contrary to the aforesaid Ordinance, should receive any thing from the People or

any of them, to their Grievance, by Brocage or other under.hand Bargain, to their own Use or that of their Lords, they shall restore it fully to him that paid the same, and never.theless, for such Extortion, they shall, on our behalf, by our Justice and Council of Ireland be duly punished ; and shall make reasonable Fine to us, as shall seem meet unto our same Justice and Council, and shall be removed forthwith, as is above rehearsed, from their Retinue: We hereby stri&ly injoining our Justice of Ireland for the Time being, that this he do faithfully observe in his own Person, and do cause the same to be observed by others.

Also, Whereas the People through almost all Ireland subjedl to Us, by the Plunderings and Takings of Victuals and other their Goods, by Purveyors of the said Chief Ministers, and very frequently by Command of those Ministers hath been lamentably depressed; We will and stedfastly command, that Purveyances of Vidluals to be made in the said Land of Ireland, for the Use of Us and our said Chief Ministers, shall be made according to the Form of the Statutes and Articles made and passed by Us in Parliaments and other great Coun.cils for the Benefit of our People, and not otherwise; So that Vidluals or other Things whatsoever to be taken for such Use, shall be appraised by the good and lawful Men of the Neighbourhood of the Places where they shall happen to be taken, sworn thereto and not menaced nor compelled by Menaces, having regard to the Price whereat such Vidluals and Things are sold in the neighbouring Markets, and the Price shall be paid forthwith : And if for dearth of Money, the said Purveyors do make Tallies of such Price to them of whom the Vidluals and Things be taken, according to the said Price, they shall pay the same within one or two Months. So always that for small Vidlual and Things so bought and taken, that is to say, within the Sum of Twenty Shillings, there shall be ready Payment in Hand made : And if our Chief Ministers shall negledl the same, We will and com.mand that our Treasurer of Ireland for the Time being, shall pay the said Price without Difficulty, out of the Fees which they our Chief Ministers do receive at our Exchequer of Dublin; or else that so much shall be subtradled from the Fee of the said Treasurer, and paid for the same Vidluals, for his Default in this Behalf: And that the Purveyors deputed to purvey such Vidluals, shall make their Corporal Oath upon the Holy Gospels of God before our Council of Ireland, That they will purvey and take Vidluals where it may be done to the greatest Advantage for Us and our Ministers, and the least Damage to our People, according to the Form of our Commissions thereof to be made to them under our Great Seal of Ireland ; which shall contain the Method and Form of making such Purveyances, according to the Tenors of the Statutes and Articles aforesaid ; and that Clause especially, Ò If they do otherwise it shall be done of them, as of Thieves And that they will not take Gifts or Fines from any, that they may spare them and grieve others; and no Vidluals or other Things shall be taken or purveyed, as is abovesaid, for the Use aforesaid, by any Commissions of our said Chief Ministers under their Seals, but only by Commissions under our Great Seal of Ireland : And We will moreover that such Purveyances shall be made by Deliberation as well of our Council, as of certain lawful and trust-worthy Persons among the Chiefs of those Neighbourhoods wherein they our said Chief Ministers shall abide, or whereto they shall happen to come; So that the Grievances in that Behalf may cease, which have hitherto woefully oppressed our liege People of Ireland. But We will not for the Honour and Worship of God, and our Holy Mother Church, that any thing be taken in anywise in Churches, or the Endowments and Fees of Churches, to the Use of Us or those Ministers, either by those our Ministers, Purveyors, or any others, against the Will of the Prelates or Ecclesiastical Persons or the Guardians of their Places and Goods.

Also, Whereas through the Default and Negledl of our said Chief Ministers, our Peace in divers Parts of the same Land, as well without the Marches as within the same, hath been improvidently kept, whereby Thieves, Malefadlors, and Disturbers of the said Peace being made bolder, have hitherto publicly committed Manslaughters and Robberies, as well in the Lands of our Peace as m the Marches, and have exadled Fines and Ransoms of divers, thattney mightlet them go in peacCj

Vol. I.

and by threatenings to kill them and to burn their House* have extorted the same; and thus in divers Parts where Peace hath been wont to flourish, the March hath become full of War and the People afHi&ed : We will and stri£Hy command that our Justice of Ireland, now or for the Time being, in every County where he shall hold his Sessions, concerning such Manslayers and Manslaughters, Robbers and Robberies, Trespasses and Trespassers, and the Exa&crs and Extorters of such Fines and Ransoms, and also concerning those who are called Idle men, and Malefactors called Kerns and those who lead them, by whom our liege People of divers Parts are oppressed and destroyed, and many of them com.pelled to leave their Homes, many Times and often in the Year, shall make diligent Inquiries, and cause the Parties indiCted to suffer Justice, if he would avoid our Indignation and the Punishment due on our Behalf.

Moreover We will and command that the Inhabitants of the Country where it shall happen that such Robbers and Ma.lefactors shall be wandering and committing Robberies and Thefts, shall make competent Satisfaction to them of the same Country who are robbed and plundered of their Goods by the Persons aforesaid, if they did not pursue such Robbers and Malefactors with Hue and Cry, nor have answered for their Bodies, according to the Form of the Statute heretofore at Winchester made and provided: And if the Keepers of the Peace in the Counties of cur said Land of Ireland should be negli.gent in the Execution of their Office, We will and command that, touching their NcgleCt and MisconduCt, by our Justice of Ireland frequent Inquiry shall be had ; and them, by Impri.sonment of their Bodies, and by Fines to be made to Us, ac.cording to the Manner, Quality, and Quantity of their Faults, NegleCts, and Offences, shall he punish and chastise.

ALSO, Whereas by Occasion of Chatters of Pardon of Felo.nies and Trespasses, by them who have hitlierto been our Justices of Ireland, generally and improvidently granted, Sedi.tions, Manslaughters, Robberies, Thefts, and Trespasses have been more frequently committed, and other Evils innumerable have ensued thereupon ; We will and command that such Char.ters shall not be granted from henceforth, except in Parliaments or Councils, by the Assent and Advice of the same Parlia.ments and Councils, having regard to the Qualities of the Persons and of the Offences committed : So that no general Pardon be thereof granted, but the Felonies or Trespasses committed shall be specified and expressed therein, according to the Tenor of a certain Statute by Us and our Council of England made, and sent into Ireland to be observed.

ALSO, Whereas our Council of Ireland and certain Prelates, Great Men, Commonalties of Cities and Towns, and likewise others being Messengers sent from Ireland, have by Letters and Suggestions untruly certified Us and our Council of Eng.land from Time to Time that there was good Peace preserved in our said Land of Ireland, and that the Peaces in all Parts or in divers Marches had been re-established ; in which Times there fell out greater Manslaughters, Burnings, and Plunderings of the English Marches and other Mischiefs from sudden Inva.sions of the Enemy than in the Times of Wars; and Wc con.fiding in these Certificates, did not provide Defences and proper Remedies as behoved Us, in convenient Time, whereby divers Countries are weakened and wasted ; the which Deceits and Delusions in such Certificates we intend not to pass over in Silence, but to punish ; Wc will, and under grievous For.feiture to Us do command, that from henceforth no Prelates, Great Men, Commonalties, or any others, for the avoiding of future Dangers, shall dare or presume, upon the Procurations of any of our Officers or otherwise, to certify Us and our Council in fuch Case, except of the Truth of the Facl; but if they presume fo to do, and be thereof found Guilty, We will cause them to suffer just Punishment.

ALSO, Whereas by Marriages and divers other Ties and the nursing of Infant Children, among the English dwelling in the Marches and the Irish, and by Forewarnings and Espyals made on both Sides by the Occasions aforesaid, infinite Destruaions and other Evils have happened hitherto, and the Expeditions of Us and our Justices there in our Name, as well in ads of

The Justice of Ireland ¥hall enquire of Man.slaughters, Robberies, Extortions, &c.

Inhabitants of the Country shall make Satisfaction forRobberics, &c.

VI.

Charters of Pardon shall not be granted, except in Parliament or Council;

Felonies shall be specified in Pardons.

VII.

The Council, &c. shall certify into England the Truth only respefting the State of Ireland.

viii. Marriages between the English and the Irish prohibited.

IX.

The Mayor# and other Officers of the Staple shall not exceed their Juriidiftion.

X.

Champarty

forbidden.

XI.

Common Pleas shall not be pleaded in the Exchequer.

XII. Bills and Suggestions shall be transmitted, under the Great Seal of England,

War as in other useful Progresses have been impeded ; Wc will and command that such Marriages, to be contradled between English and Irish, and other private Ties and nursing of Infant Children, shall from henceforth cease, and be alto.gether done away; and that our Justice of Ireland for the Time being shall make diligent Inquiry from Time to Time, of such Marriages between English and Irish, and Ties and nursing of Infants, and of the Adherings together, Forewarn.ings and Espyals made by such Occasions, if hereafter any shall happen to be contrafled or made, and shall punish the Offend.ers according to the Law and Custom of our Land of Ireland.

ALSO, Wheteas the Mayors, Constables, and other Officers of the Staple of Ireland, by Colour of the Statute of the Staple, do hold Cognizance of, and make erroneous and unjust Pro.cesses in, Pleas of Debt and Trespasses, and divers other Complaints, which concern not the Traffick of the Staple, and of old Caufes before the Time of the said Staple, like as in Matters and Pleas of the Staple, to the very grievous Damage of our People of those Parts: We will, and do injoin and command, that the said Mayors, Constables, or other Officers of the saiil Staple, do not hold any other Pleas than those which belong to them, according to the Effeft, Form, and Tenor of the abovesaid Statute of the Staple; But if they fo do, our said Justice shall from Time to Time thereof make Inquiry, and fhall duly punish the Offenders.

ALSO, Whereas certain Officers both Great and Small, and the Serjeants who plead in our Courts there, and sometimes the Clerks of the Courts, notwithstanding the Sta.tutes passed touching Champarties, as well for Gifts and Bargains, as mutual Covenants among themselves and some of the Parties pleading before them, to have the Lands in Plea when they should be recovered, have maintained and defended and aided one of the Parties; so that commonly the Land so in Plea, and recovered through an Error in Justice by the Maintenance and Aid of the aforesaid Serjeants and Officers, hath remained in the Hands of some One of them, without his paying any thing or but little for the same ; and thus the Parties be cheated out of their Land, and having lost the Expences incurred by the Cause, have been brought unto Poverty or a State of Misery: We will and command, and do striftly injoin, under grievous Forfeiture to LTs, and under the Penalties contained in the said Statutes, That none of our Officers Great or Small, Serjeants or any Clerks whatever, do make or carry on such Maintenances, Defences, or Aids of Parties upon such Occasions against Justice, nor do obtain Land so in Plea, or attempt any Thing else against the Form of the same Statutes.

ALSO, Whereas Writs of Debt and Trespass and other Things besides, which ought to be pleaded before our Justices at the Common Law, are commonly pleaded in our Exchequer of Dublin by Writs of the same Exchequer, whereby our Treasurer and Barons, and the Clerks of the same Exchequer, being occupied about such Pleas, are hindered from attending to the Businesses of Us and our People, which belong to their Offices in the same Exchequer by the Law and Custom thereof; whereby the said Businesses are daily delayed, to the grievous Damage of Us and our People; We will, and striflly injoining do command, that such Common Pleas be not pleaded in the said Exchequer, contrary to the Form of the Statute thereof made and provided ; and that the Chancellor of the same Exchequer, if he do sign such Common-Law Writs, or do cause or suffer the same to be signed under the Seal of the said Exchequer, for the Contempt done unto Us, and for the Wrong brought upon the Party, shall before our Justice either by our Writ or by Bill, answer as it behoveth him to do.

ALSO, Whereas through false and untrue Suggestions of certain Persons of Ireland passing to and fro, having barking mouths, and striving to injure the Fame and Reputation of our good Officers and other liege Subjefts in those Parts, as well by Bills as Suggestions, not without Scandal, the Affairs of Us and our Land arc thereby many Times obstructed ; We will and

ordain that from henceforth such Bills and Suggestions, when put into Writing, shall be transmitted under the Seal of our Chancellor of England for the Time being, to our Justice, Chancellor, and Treasurer of Ireland for the Time being: To the End that they, calling unto them such others as they shall think meet to be called, in the Presence of the said Comers to and fro, or Brocagers, whom we do likewise will to be sent back into Ireland, shall make diligent Inquiry of the Contents of such Bills and Suggestions aforesaid; and if the Bills and Suggestions do contain Truth, they shall duly correft and amend the Defaults. And if the said Comers to and fro, and Brocagers have suggested Falsehoods and Lies, they shall suffer due Punishment, that fuel) Punishment may afford a Warning to others to abstain from such Things.

ALSO, Although in the Treaties of Peace between our Justice of Ireland and the Irish, upon the Wars moved on either Side, it hath been commonly expressed that for Damages caused by Wrong-doers, Peace broken, or mutual Depreda.tions done by Invafions, Restitution of Goods or due Satif- fa&ion fhould be made to the Sufferers; but the said Justices heretofore have not cared to insist upon the making such Satisfaction to the English Party injured, whereby the said English have been hitherto depressed, and the Enemies being thence enriched have been eager so much the sooner to break the Peace, and to commit Plunders and other direful Evils; We will and stcdfastly command, that the Justice of Ireland for the Time being, when it shall have been ordained by Peaces and Treaties of Peace, or otherwise, that fuch Satisfaction shall be made on either Side, shall diligently insist and take care, that in such Case mutual Justice and speedy Satisfaction be done to the Sufferers of the Wrong in that Behalf.

to the Justice, Chancellor, and Treasurer of Ireland; and Inquiry shall be made thereon.

XIII.

On Treaties of Peace concluded between the Justice of Ireland and the Irish, the stipulated Satisfaflion shall be strictly exacted.

ALSO, Whereas the Sheriffs of Counties in Ireland have often and repeatedly by grievous Distresses levied, of the People of their Bailiwicks, many and divers Debts of the Green Wax, and other Debts arising upon Summons and Estreats, and otherwise in Demand; and have neither charged themselves in their Accounts, nor, at the Exchequer aforesaid acquitted them who paid, to our great Damage and the manifest De.pression of the People; We being minded to apply a Remedy in this Behalf, do will and stcdfastly command, that our Justice of Ireland for the Time being, in every County where he shall hold his Sessions, shall diligently inquire, that is to say once in the Year at least, concerning such Debts so paid to the Sheriffs by those of the People, whether once or more, that is to say, as well for the Time past, as he shall deem e.vpedicnt, as for the Time to come ; and all such Debts, which, by Tallies or Acquittances of the said Sheriffs, or the Under Sheriffs or Serjeants-generul of those Counties, or Stewards, or Bailiffs, or other Officers, or by Inquests thereof to be taken or by other lawful Means, it shall be made appear, have been paid to them by those of the People, together with the Names of the Receivers and Payers, he shall cause to be inrolled and put into Writing, and the Rolls to be sent under his Seal to the Exchequer aforesaid : To the end, that the Treasurer and Barons of the same Exchequer, upon impeding those Rolls, and examining the Rolls there abiding of Accounts of those Sheriffs and other Officers aforesaid, and other Rolls and Remembrances touching the Premises, calling before them the Sheriffs Officers and others who should be called, Ihall caufe them the faid Sheriffs and Officers, with the Sums which it may be made appear that they did so levy, without charging them.selves in their Accounts or otherwise for the same, to be charged, and for the Concealments in that Behalf to be punished, and the Payers of the same at the said Exchequer to be ac.quitted, and if the same Debtors shall luve paid One and the same Debt many Times, the same Sheriffs and Officers or their Heirs or Executors, to be compelled to restore the same beyond one Receipt to the faid Debtors, their Heirs or Execu.tors, as is just. And if the aforesaid Justice cannot attend to these Matters, being hindered from various Causes, We wili and command, that three or two of the most trufty and lawful Men of those Counties shall be assigned by Commissions under our Great Seal which we use in Ireland, to inquire, and to do and fulfil all other 1 lungs in the same Article contained, in the Form aforesaid.

XIV.

The Justice of Ireland shall

enquire of the KingÕs Debts paid to the Sheriffs ;

and certify them with the Names of the Receiver* and Payers into the Exchequer.

Treasurer and Barons shall charge the Sheriffs thereon, and acquit the Payers.

The Justice of Ireland shall compel Sheriffs to refund, where the same Debt hath been many Times paid.

XV.

Acquittances of Debts in the Exchequer shall be entered on the Rolls of the Remem.brancers.

XVI.

The King's Subjects shall not be taken or imprisoned by the Justices without Indictments, or Present.ments.

XVII. The Justice of Ireland with the Assistance of a Prelate and Earl, the Chancellor and others, shall yearly inquire into the Conduct of inferior Officers.

ALSO, Although many of our Debtors have paid their Debts required of them, at the aforesaid Exchequer, and have been discharged and acquitted thereof in the great Rolls of the same Exchequer, ye.t those Debtors, in the Rolls of the Re.membrancers of the same Exchequer, whence the Exa&ion of those Debts hath issued, are not acquitted of the faid Debts ¥, whereby the very Debts paid do almost daily run in Demand, and they being so acquitted, nevertheless under pretext of Exadions issuing from the RemembrancerÕs Offices, by grievous Distresses, with grievous Expenses and Travail, being com.pelled to come to the said Exchequer upon this Occasion, and to plead, and to pay large Sums for making Searches in the same RemembrancerÕs Offices, are miserably depressed; We will therefore, and do stedfastly command, that the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer aforesaid, do injoin and cause the Engrossers of the same Exchequer, when any such Debtors shall have been made quit of Debts in the same Rolls, forth.with to shew those Acquittances to the aforesaid Remem.brancers, and the faid Remembrancers to be thereof in like Manner discharged and acquitted in their Rolls; under a duely grievous Penalty, pecuniary or other, upon those in whom Negleft or Omission in this Behalf shall be found, by our said Justice and others of our Council, in their Difcretion, to be imposed.

ALSO, Whereas certain of our Justices of Ireland have arrested taken and imprisoned divers Men of Ireland Great and Small, by Writs, Precepts, Bills, and otherwise, at their Will, anil without Indiftments, Presentments, or due Pro.cesses, and have detained them in dark Prisons and bound in Fetters, until through Duresses, Imprisonments, and Pains inflifted, they paid Fines and Ransoms to the Justices and their private Counsellers and Brocagers according to their Pleafure, to their own personal Profit and not ours, again!! the Form of the Great Charter and other our Statutes there.upon made, and against the Law and Custom of the said Land ; So that by Means of such private Counsellers and their Covetousness and personal Profits, our Rights and those of our Crown and our Profits have been often withdrawn, injured, subverted, and lost; and likewise many Persons, as well those indi&ed, as those not mdieled, being imprisoned, have besought the said Justices to have their Deliverances according to the. Law and Custom of the said Land, which they could not obtain at the Common Law, until they made and paid in like Manner such Fines and Ransoms to the faid Justices and their private Counsellers, to receive for their own Use not our$, for having their Deliverances at the Com.mon Law, or gave them Security for the same as con.tented them j We will and stedfastly command, that Men beiug our Subjefts, without Indictments, or Presentments, or other due Processes, against the Form of the Charter and Statutes aforesaid and the Law and Custom abovementioned, by our Justices of Ireland, for the Time being, or their Lieu.tenants, or.by their Precepts, or Commands, or by Bills, shall by no Means be taken nor imprisoned. And if the contrary be clone,, as well for the Time past as in future, against the Offenders, according to the Advice of our Council, at the Complaints of the Party grieved and making Complaint, We will cause timely Remedy to be applied.

ALSO, Whereas by the good and discreet Government of Ministers, the Land and People are strengthened, and Affairs have a prosperous Issue, so by their Neglect and Folly unex.pected Evils do arise, Wrongs happen, and Businesses are in various ways obstructed, We will, and for the public Weal of Ourselves, and our Land and People of Ireland do ordain, That our Justice of Ireland for the Time being, taking unto him one Prelate and one Earl of the Parts nearest to those where the Inquests following are to be made, and the Chancellor and Treasurer and certain others of the more learned Justices of the Courts, and Barons of the Exchequer there, every Year about the middle of the Year, by the Oath of good and lawful Men, as well of Clerks as Knights and other lawful Men of the County of Dublin, and of other Coun.ties if need be of our said Land of Ireland, concerning the AClings and Doings of our Officers of the aforesaid Land, (the Chancellor, Treasurer, justices of both Courts and Barons of the aforesaid Exchequer, who are Judges in their own Courts,

Inconvenicn- cics arifing from the recited Statute;

All Persona may buy Herring openly, but not privily.

No Man shall interrupt another in a Bargain of Herring; nor bid upon him.

Fishermen may sell their Herring as soon ag they arrive.

before: amongst other Things it was ordained by Us and our Council, that the said Fishers of Herring should be free to sell their Herring to all People that will come to the said Fair of (') Yarmouth, without any Disturbance of their Hosts or any other; and when the said Fishers would sell their Merchandises in the Port, they should have their Hosts with them, if they would be there, and in their Presence, and in the Presence of other Mer.chants openly should sell their Merchandises to whom they pleased; and if other Merchants present would have Part of the said Merchandises, every of them should have [for his Part upon the taking,1] after the Rate of the same Merchandises so sold; and the said Sale shall be made from the Sun-rising till the Sun going down, and not before nor after; and that no Hosteler, nor other, buy Herring to hang in his House by Covin, nor in other Manner, at an higher Price the Last than Forty Shillings : Nevertheless, Because it is shewed to Us and to oiir Council by Petition in this pre.sent Parliament, that the Sale of Herring is much decayed, and the People greatly endamaged by the Points aforesaid; that is to say, that many Merchants coming to the Fair, as well Labourers and Servants, as other, do bargain for Herring, and every of them by Malice and Envy increase upon other, and if one proffer Forty Shilling, another will proffer Ten Shillings more, and the Third Sixty Shillings, and so every one sur- mounteth other in the Bargain, and such Proffers extend to more than the Price of the Herring upon which the Fishers proffered it to sell at the Beginning: And when every Man (Õ) claitneth his Part of the Herring for the Price accorded, [he*] shall have his Part, and the Herring shall be so divided amongst them, that the Fisher is so much grieved and delayed in the gathering of his Money, that he should demand of so many Per.sons, that he leeseth his [Mart5] and the Advantage of his Fishing; and also herein, that no fresh Herring is put to Sale but from the Sun-rising till the Sun going down, and not before nor after, which is to the great Loss of Fishers, and appairing of the Herring, and Da.mage of the People that shall buy the same; for the Fishing is more by Night than by Day, and often it chanceth, that the Fishers be [so long and so charged,6] that they come to the Town after Sun going down, or little before, so that they cannot sell their Herring in the Time for the Sale limited, so that they must abide all the Night and the Day after upon the Sale of their Herring, and lose many [Marts and Profits7] of their Fishing: We, perceiving the Mischiefs and Grie.vances aforesaid, by the Advice and Assent of our Par.liament, will and grant, that it shall be lawful to every Man, of what Condition that he be, Merchant or other, to buy Herring openly, and not privily, at such Price as may be agreed betwixt him and the Seller of the same Herring; and that no Man enter in Bargain upon the buying of the same, till he that first cometh to bargain shall have an End of his Bargain agreeable to the Seller, and that none (8) increase upon other during the first Bargain, upon Pain of Forfeiture to Us the Double of his Proffer, but every Man shall have the Herring so bought according to the Bargain thereof made. And that every Fisher may deliver and sell his Herring and Fish at every [Mart,9] when he cometh to the said Town of Great Yarmouth, without any Disturbance or Impeachment, notwithstanding any Ordinance made to the contrary before this Time. In Witness whereof We have caused these our Letters Patents to be made. Given at Westminster the Twentieth Day of February, in the Five and Thirtieth Year of our Reign of England.

By the King Himself and Council in Parliament.

And it is not the Mind of the King, the Great Men, nor of ihe Commons, that the Ordinance made of the said Wines, the said xlii. Year, be repealed or ad- nulled, but shall abide in Suspence till a Man may see what Profit or Damage this present Grant hereafter shall do in the Realm.

ITEM, Forasmuch as the Great Men and Commons of the Realm before this Time, and now in this present Parliament, have grievously complained, for that the KingÕs Butler and his Lieutenants in divers Places and Ports of the Realm, have ingrossed and taken by Colour of their Office, for the House and Expences of the King, (') and by such Colour have arrested the Wines [which'] Merchants brought into the said Realm, and holden them so long in Arrest, that the Great Men [and Commons,] and other of the Realm, cannot thereof make their Purveyance, nor Merchants their Profit, and oftentimes by such Colour have ingrossed and taken of them so many [Tuns of] Wine, above that was needful for the King, that they have commonly sold the same, and thereof made their singular Profit, and as much as other Merchants and Vintners in the Realm, to the great Damage of the said Merchants and other: Whereupon the King desiring to ordain Remedy, of the Assent of the Great Men and Commons in this present Parliament, hath ordained, That the Butler, nor any of his Lieutenants, shall not buy, ingross, nor take, by Colour of their Office, nor in other Manner to their proper Use, nor of others, more Wines for the House and Expence of the King than they have in Command.ment, upon Pain of Imprisonment of their Bodies, and to be ransomed at the KingÕs Will: And as much as they shall take by Force of the said Warrant, shall be taken within Ten Days; and, that done, the Merchants of the said Wines may, and it shall be lawful to them, of the Remnant of the said Wines [another Time3 ] to make their Profit, notwithstanding any Arrest made upon such Wines by the Butler, or any of his Lieute.nants aforesaid.

ITEM, Because that the Commons of the said Realm have prayed the King, that it may please him, to pardon them of his special Grace, all the Trespasses done in the Forests in Times past; the King, having regard to the great Aids, which his said Commons have often.times done to him, and the Charges which they in sundry Manners have sustained, of his special Grace hath released and pardoned to his said Commons, and to every of them, every Manner of Trespass of Vert and Venison done before this Time in his Forests, and the Price and Forfeiture of Vert, and also all the Fines, Amerciaments, and Ransoms made or to be made by this Cause. And if any of the said Commons at this Time be arrested, imprisoned, or let to Mainprise for such Cause, they shall be incontinently released and de.livered free and quite,and their Mainpernors also; Except expressly the Justices, [Agistours, Chief Keepers,4] of Forests, Parks, and Chaces,as well in Fee as otherwise,and all Foresters, and Verdours, Regardours and Agistours, Lieutenants of Keepers, Under Foresters, and all their Servants, and Sellers of Woods and Underwoods, and all other Ministers of the KingÕs Forests, Parks, and Chaces ; whom the King will not to be comprised in this Pardon.

And therefore We command Thee, That thou do the said Ordinances to be cried and published in Cities, Boroughs, and Ports of the Sea, and all other Places within thy Bailiwick, as well within Franchise as without, in Places where to Thee shall seem convenient, and the same do to be firmly holden and kept according to the Form and Tenor of the same.

¥ In all Printed Copies this Statute is ascribed to the Fiftieth Year of this Reign ; and in the Body of the Statute it is stated to have passed in that Year. But it appears from Rot. Pari. 31 Etiw. III. that the Parliament in which this Statute was made, was begun to be holden in Fifteen Days of Saint Hilary, which was the Tuesday next after the Conversion of Saint Paul, in the beginning of the Fifty-first Year of this Reign.

[another Time,1] that the same hi* Commons should be thereof utterly discharged till the xiij. Day of Oftober, the said xxxvj. Year, at which Day the same Pardon was made, as more plainly is contained in the same: Will and granteth to the Honour of God, which so long hath suffered him to reign over the same his People in (*) Prosperity; that the same his Commons of England, and every singular Person of the same, of what Estate or Condition that they be, as well Small as Great,-shall have now and enjoy all such Graces and Pardons of all Things comprised within the said Pardon, fallen or chanced from the said xiij. Day of Ottober, till the beginning of this present I. Year. And Moreover, our said Sovereign Lord the King, hath pardoned and re.leased to his said Commons, all Manner of Gifts, Alienations, and Purchases made by them or any of them, of Lands and Tenements holden of him in Chief, without the King's Licence; and all Manner of Entries, if they have made any, in their Heritage after the Death of their Ancestors, without suing them out of the KingÕs Hands by due Process, till the beginning of the sathq Fiftieth Year, except those Tenements which be aliened into Mortmain, and those Tenements also which now be seised into the KingÕs Hands, because of (J) Alien.ations and Entries: And (J) hath wholly pardoned and released all Fines, Amerciaments, Issues, Forfeits, Reliefs, and Escuages made, fallen, or chanced within the same Realm of England ; and also all Manner of Debts and Accompt9 till the Fortieth Year of [his Reign;5] and also all Manner of Adions and Demands, which he hath or may have by him Sole, or else jointly with other Persons, against any of his said Commons, as well for the Cause of the same Debts and Acoompts, as otherwise because of Passages of Wools, Leather, and Woolfels, or other Merchandises to the Parts beyond the Sea, against the Defences and Ordinances thereof made, as well privily and in the Name of the Merchants, or by Colour of Letters Patents granted at Drodagh, or elsewhere beyond the Sea, as by any other Way for these Causes, and as well of the Time of Walter of [Charlton,6] and his Fellows late Fermora of the Sub.sidy and Customs, as in other Times, till the Fortieth Year of his said Reign of England; except all the Debts that be judged by Seisin of Lands or Tenements, or [to be determined7] in other Manner; and except the Debts that be now at this Time due unto him by any that have been Sheriffs, Eschetors, Colleftors of Customs and Subsidies, Dismes and Quinzimes, Fermort of Manors, Vi&uallers, and other that have been in Great Offices with our Sovereign Lord the King in Times past, which be yet [in plain Life.'] And also our Sovereign Lord the King hath generally pardoned them the Suit of his Peace, for all Manner of Felonies done or committed before the beginning of the said Fiftieth Year, with the Outlawries if any [be in them*] by such Enchesons pronounced : Except always Trea.sons, Murders, Common Thefts, and also Rapes of Women.

ITEM, It is ordained and stablished of the said Assent, That Whereas a Consultation is once duly granted upon a Prohibition made to the Judge of the Holy Church, that the same Judge may proceed in the Cause by virtue of the same Consultation, notwith.standing any other Prohibition thereupon to him deli.vered : Provided always, That the Matter in the Libel of the said Cause be not engrossed, enlarged, or other.wise changed.

ITEM, Because that Complaint is made to our Lord the King, by the Clergy of His said Realm of England, that as well divers Priests bearing the sweet Body of our Lord Jesus Christ to Sick People, and their Clerks with them, as otherwise divers other Persons of Holy Church, whiles they attend to Divine Services in Churches, Churchyards, and other Places dedicate to God, be sundry Times taken and arrested by Authority Royal, and Commandment of other Temporal Lords, in Offence of God, and of the Liberties of (') Holy Church, and also in Disturbance of Divine Services aforesaid ; the same our Lord the King, who would be sore dis.pleased if any did in such Manner, will and granteth, and defendeth upon his grievous Forfeiture, That none do the same from henceforth ., So that Collusion or feigned Cause be not found in any of the said Persons of Holy Church in this Behalf.

ITEM, Because that divers People [inherit of di.vers Tenements, borrowing divers Goods in Money or in Merchandise of divers People of this Realm, do give their Tenements and Chattels to their Friends, by Col.lusion thereof to have the Profits at their Will, and after do flee to the Franchise of Westminster, of St. Martin le Grand of London, or other such privileged Places, and there do live a great Time with an high Counte.nance of another ManÕs Goods and (!) Profits of the said Tenements and Chattels, till the said Creditors shall be bound to take a small Parcel of their Debt, and release the Remnant; It is ordained and assented, That if it be found that such Gifts be so made by Col.lusion, that the said Creditors shall have Execution of the said Tenements and Chattels, as if no such Gift had been made.

ITEM, It is ordained and defended by our Lord the King, That no Woollen Cloths shall be carried into any Part out of our Realm of England before they be fulled; nor that any Subsidy be thereof demanded nor paid, before that they be fulled.

ITEM, It is ordained and established, That no Subsidy nor Aulnage shall be paid, levied, nor deman.ded of Cloths called Friseware, which be made in Ire.land, or otherwise in England of Irish Wool, brought within the Realm of England, because that those Cloths do not contain the Length and Breadth ordained by the Statute ; and for so much they ought not to be com.prised in the Statutes late made of Ray Cloths and coloured Cloths.

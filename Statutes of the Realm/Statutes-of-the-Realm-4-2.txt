The Oldest Printed Copies of the Statute of this Year agree in Date with the vacated Roll. This Parliament was originally summoned for 13th October, An. 28 Eliz. A.D. 1586; on which Day it was prorogued to the 27th of the same Month-, and on that Day further prorogued to the 29th, when it met and sate, (on the Business of Mary Queen of Scots, but without passing any Act,) until 2 December, An. 29 Eliz. A.D. 1586, and was on that Day adjourned [not prorogued] to 13 February, An. 29 Eliz. A.D. 1386-7. when it met again and sate until the 23d of March ensuing; and on that Day was dissolved : See Sir S. D' Ewes's Journals of the Houses of Lords and Commons of this Tear. The Statute of this Year has in all Printed Copies been intituled * 29th Elizabeth; But see Stats. 33 Eliz. c. 1. $ 7.; c.j. 11, 8cc. where Acts passed in this Parliament are recited as of 28th Elizabeth.

Neither of the Rolls notice or contain the Acts for the Subsidies or Pardon, which are inserted in all Printed Copies as Chapters VII. VHI. and IX. of the Statute of this Session: These are now printed from the Original Acts in the Parliament Office. No Titles are entered in the Margin of the several Acts on the Roll; but it has been thought convenient to reprint the Titles in the above List at the Head of each Chapter printed.

CHAPTER X.

Ax Acte for the increase of Marriners, and for mainten*nce of the Navigacon, repealinge a former Acte made in the xxiijUl yeare of her Majestyes Raigne, bearing the same Title.

TTTHERE at the Parliament holden by Prorogation the sixtenth day of January, in the three and twentyth yeare V ▼ of the Raigne of our most gracyous Soveraigne Lady Queene Elizabeth, An Acte was made entituled An Acte for thincrease of Maryners and for maynten*nce of the Navigac&n, whereby amongest other Things it was enacted, that it shoulde not be lawfull to any native English man Woman or Denyzon, at any tyme after a tyme lymitted in the same Acte, directly or indirectly by themselves their Servantf Factors Agents Deputyes or Freindf, or any of them whatsoever, to go or sende into any other forreine Cuntrye Realme or Domynyon whatsoever, for the buyeng pviding or bringing into this Realme out or from any the said forreine Realmes or Domynions out of the Queenes Obeysance, of any salted Fish or salted Herringf, nor should make any agreement with any Alyen or Straunger or any other for such bringing into this Realme, by any Alyen or Straunger, of any salted Fysh or salted Herringf; And that no salted Fysh nor salted Herringf should be brought hither out of the said forreyne Realmes and Domynions but by the mere Owners thereof or Deputyes of them, being Alyens and Straungers, without the peurement of any Subject of the Queenes Majestye her Heires or Successors, or of any Denyson and by none other pson or psons, upon payne that such Englysh pson or Denyzen offending against that Acte, should forfaite the same salted Herringf and salted Fysh, or the value thereof; with divers other clauses and branches in the same Statute conteyned towching the bringing of Fysh into this Realme, and the byeng and selling of Fysh, as by the same Acte at large appeareth: Uppon the making of which Acte it was hoped and expected, that the Fishermen of this Realme woulde in such sort have employed themselves to fyshing, and to the building and Sparing of such store of Boats and Shipping for that p'pose, as that they should longe eare this tyme have beene able sufficyently to have victualled this Realme with salted Fysh and Herringf of their own taking, without any supply of Alyens and Straungers, to the great increase of Marryners, and mainten*nce of the Navigac&n within this Realme; Notwithstanding it is since founde by experience, that the Navigac&n of this Lande is no whit bettered by meanes of that Acte, nor any Marriners increased nor like to be increased by it; but cont*ry wise, the naturall Subjects of this Realme being not able to fumysh the tenth part of the same with salted Fysh of their own taking, the cheife Pvysion and [Victuallf *] thereof with Fysh and Herringf hath ever since the making of the same Statute bene in the power and disposic&n of Alyens and Straungers, who thereby have much enriched themselves, greately increased their Navigac&n, and (taking advantage of the tyme) have extreamely enhaunced the pries of that Victuall, to the greate hurt and ympoverishing of the native Subjects of this Realme, and yet do serve the Marcketf here in very evill sort by little and little, bowsing and keeping their Fysh as well on this side as beyonde the Seas, till the pries be raysed to their liking; and the Marchantf of this Realme having bene wholly barred in their Tradf of pviding of Fyshe for the service thereof, the Navigac&n of this

Readme, which was intended to be augmented, hath bene rather empayred then increased thereby, and the pries of Fysh greately enhaunced, to the greate and generall pjudice of the Subjects : For remedy whereof, and for that it is lawfull as well to Strangers and Alyens as to the Subjects of this Realme, to carrye out into forreyne Parts and Domynions such salted Fysh and Herringf as are taken and pvided by the Subjects of this Realme, and therefore very unequall that the natyve Subjects of this Lands should not be at lihtye to bringe in also forreine pvysion of Fishe, for the victualling of their owne Cuntrye as well as to cary out, but that the Straunger should be wholly trusted therewith; Be it therefore enacted by the Queenes most excellent Majesty the Lords Spuall and Temporall and Comons in this p>sent Parliament assembled and by the auctority of the same. That the same Statute made in the said three and twentith yeare of her Majesties most gracious Raigne, and every Clause Branch Article and Proviso thereof, and all the Penaltyes and Forfeitures therein conteyned, shall from henceforth be clearely repealed void frustrate and of none effect to all Intentf Constructions and Purposes, as yf the same had never bene had ne made; Any Thing in the same Act conteyned to the cont*ry thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

Unprecedented Reasons justify this unprecedented Grant.

advised and mature deliberation we have sufficiently perceaved howe greate and inestimable Charges yo1 Ma*“ hath susteyned many yeares, in seekeing (by way of prevention) to hinder all such forren Attemptf as others (not provided for) might long since have proved perilous to the whole Estate of this Comon wealth ; And where it is apparaunt to all the Worlde that yf yo' Ma0' had not exhausted the greatest portion of yor private Treasures, besides all other meanes derived from our dutifull Affecc&ns, aswell in making tymely provision of all things necessary for yo' Navie and Annie Royall, as in maynetayning and using the same (at tymes convenient), that wee should long before this day have been exposed to the danger of manie soddaine and dangerous Attemptf of our Enemyes, and fayled in all those happy Successes which have accompanied yor Royall Acc&ns taken in hand for the Defence of this Estate; And seeing also that at this present tyme yo' Highenes hath been put to inestimable Charge in the necessary prosecution of an unnaturall Rebellion within yo' Highnes Realme of Ireland, daylie fedd by forrein Enemyes, whose Actions have not only tended to the subverc&n of Gods trewe Religion planted amongest us, and to the bereaving of that Realme from yo' Imperial! Crowne of England to which it hath been soe manie yeares joyned and annexed, but consequently to the ruyne and spoyle of this most florishing Kingdome of England ; For the better effecting whereof the King of Spaine hath now openly invaded the Realme of Ireland with an Army already landed in the Province of Munster, haveing not forebome to publishe there his resolute purpose to usurpe to himselfe that Crowne, even by a plaine Conquest (in case of Resistance), thoughe coullored with a vayne pretexte of an Illusory Donac&n from the Sea of Rome, whose usurped Aucthoritie we have abandoned (as becommeth all good Subjects to doe), that meane noe lesse in Deede then they professe in Name: For as much as we doe seriously consider that yo' Ma*1' (and we yo' faithfull and obedient Subjects) are but one Body Pollitike, and that yo' Highness is the Head and we the Members, and that noe Good or Felicitie Perill or Adversitie can come to the one but the other shall partake thereof, We have thought it a Matter incident to the naturall Care and Sence we ought to feele of our present and future Condic&n, seeing yo' Enemyes are strengthened by combination with other States, and doe receave from their Confederatf greate Coniribu£&ns of Treasure for Advancement of this and such like Enterprises, whileste we doe see on the other syde that your Ma'f Expences only tende to the Advancement of the trew Glorie of God, and Defence of the Libertie and Felicitie of the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme and of the Kingdomes and Dominions thereof, and are neither supported by any other Prince or State, nor caried on in yo' self with any vaine Ambition or wastefull humor of consuming the Treasure of this Kingdome, to offer to yo' Ma'1* the Disposic&n of such meanes as God hath geven us to be ymploied for preservacSn of Gods cause, for maintenaunce of yo' owne dignitie, and all such Rights and Titles as be annexed to yo' Imperiall Crowne; being fully resolved to leave both Landes Goodes and whatsoever else that is deerest unto us, (yea and this mortall lief,) rather then we woulde suffer yo* Royall Estate to be in any pt diminyshed, or the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme deprived of any Hono' Title Right or Interest thereunto belonging, or suffer any forreigne power to growe on further, or to contynue so long unremoved, as thereby to leave them any grownde to presume of good successes, either in this acc&n now begon, or in any future enterprise, which may tende to the dishono' or perill of any yo' Ma'f Kingdomes: In which Considerac&n, and many other needlesse to repeate, we have thought ourselves bound in thankefullnes to God for You, and to yo' Ma1” for ourselves, whoe feele the happines of yo' most gratious Clemency and Justice at home, under yo' happie and pollidke Govemement daylie multiplied unto us, (beyond the example of all ages,) to prepare and make not only our persons ready to withstand resiste and subdue the force and puissaunce of our Enemyes (be they never so potent), but also to present unto you Fower Subsidies and Eight Fifteenes and Tenthes, thereby to make up some such pordttn of Treasure, as may (in some sorte) supplie the greate and inestimable Charges which You our most gracious and dread Sov*aigne have and daylie must susteyne: All which, notwithstanding it be much lesse then may be sufficient for this present and urgent Necessities, yet being a playn demonstrac&n of our due Considerac&n of all those necessarie Causes and important Resons which we have heard delivered by yo' royall Direcc&n, We have thought meete not only to make it one of our first Workes to consult of that matter, which in other Sessions of Parliament hath usually succeeded manie other Acts and Consultac&ns, but so to enlarge and improve the measure of this Oblac&n which we shall offer to yor Royall pson, as it may geve yo' Ma0' an assured Testimony of our internall Zeales and Duties, to be further manifested hereafter by the hazard of our Lyves and Fortunes at all tyme for yo' Ma0" service, whereof we beseech you to vouchsafe (at this p>sent) the gratious Acceptation, as proceeding from those loving and faithfull Subjects of yo", who doe desire to testifie, (both in the extraordinary forme and substance of our psent offer,) that thoughe there lyveth (and ev* shall) in the Harts of yo' most humble and obedient Subjects an extraordinary zeale to yo' Ma'f pson, yet that we desire and intende that this, (which is done to you at this tyme,) shalbe no otherwies interpreted then as a lively monument of those greate Duties and AffeccSns which we doe contentedly and comfortablie strayne for yo' Ma0*, and in a maniJ far exceeding any former p>sident, because noe Age either hath or can produce the like p'sident of so much happines under any Princes Reigne, nor of so contynuall gracyowse care for our p>servac6n as yo' Ma°* hath shewed in all yo' Acc&ns, havynge never stuck to hazard, or rather neglect, for our p>serva£&n anye pte of those worldely blessingf wherewith Almightie God hath so plentifully indued you in this tyme of yo' most happie Governement: And therefore We do with all duty and humble Affecc&ns that Hart can conceive or Tongue can utter present to yo' sacred Mallc Fower entire Subsedies, and Eight Fifteenes and Tenthes toward yo' Highnes greate Charges for our Defence: And We doe most humblie beseeche yo' Ma"' that it may be enacted by the aucthoritie of this psent Parliament in man8 and forme followinge, (that is to say): That yo' Ma"* shall have Eight whole Fifteenes and Tenthes, to be payd taken and levied of the moveable Goods Chattells and other Things usuall to such Fifteenes and Tenthes to be contributory and chargeable, within the Shires Citties Boroughes Townes and other Places of this yo' Ma°" Realme, in manS and forme aforetime used;

CHAPTER I.

Ah Acte for a publique Thanckesgiving to Almighty God everie Yeere on the fifte day of November.

FORASMUCH as Almightie God hath in all ages shewed his power and mercy in the miraculous and gracious deliveraunce of his Church, and in the ptecc&n of religious Kings and States, And that no Nacion of the Earth hath bene blessed with greater benefittf then this Kingdome now enjoyeth, having the true and free pfession of the Gospell under our moste gracious SoPaigne Lorde Kinge James, the moste Great learned and Religious Kinge that ever Raigned therein, enriched with a most hopefoll and plentifull pgenie pceeding out of his Royall loynes pmysmg continuance of this happines and pfession to all Posteritie: the which many malignant and devilishe Papistf Jesuites and Semynarie Priests muche envying and fearing Conspired most horriblie, when the Kings most excellent Majesde, the Queene the Prince, and all the Lordes spuall and temporall and C5mons should have bene assembled in the upper Howse of Parliamente uppon the fifte day of November in the yeere of our Lorde 1605 suddenly to have blowen up the saide whole Howse with Gunpowder ; An invenc&n soe inhumane, barbarous and cruel], as the like was never before heard of, and was (as some of the principall Conspirators thereof confesse) purposely devised and concluded to be done in the saide Howse, that where sundrie necessarie and Religious lawes for pservacbn of the Church and State were made, which they falsly and slaunderously terme cruell lawes enacted against them and theire Religion, both place and psons should be all destroyed and blowen upp at once, which would have turned to the utter ruine of this whole Kingdome-had it not pleased Almighty God, by inspiring the Kings most Excellent Majesty with a divine Spiritt to interpret some darke phrases of a letter shewed to his Majesty above and beyond all ordinary Coustruccftn, thereby miraculously discovering this hidden Treason not many howres before the appointed tyme for the execucbn thereof: Therefore the Kings most Excellent Majesde the lordes spuall and Temporall, and all his Majesties faithfull and lovinge Subjects doe most justly acknowledge this greate and infinite Blessing to have pceeded merely from God his great Mercy, and to his most Holy name doe ascribe all the Honour Glory and Praise. And to the end this unfained thankfullnes may never be forgotten, but be had in a ppetual Remembrance that All ages to come may yeeld Praises to his Divine Majesde for the same and have in memory this joyful Day of deliverance;

Be it therefore enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majestie the lordes Spuall and temporall and the Comons in this psent Parliament assembled and by the Authority of the same, That all and singuler Ministers in every Cathedrall and Parishe Church or other usuall Place for C5mon Prayer within this Realme of England and the Dominions of the same shall alwaies uppon the fifte day of November say Mominge Prayer and give unto Allmightie God thankes for this most happy deliverance, And that all and everie pson and psons inhabiting within this Realme of England and the

CHAPTER II.

An Acte for the Attaindors of divers Offendors in the late moste barbarous monstrous detestable and

damnable Treasons.

IN moste humble manner beseechen your most Excellent Majesty your most loyall faithfull and true hearted Subjects the Lordes Spuall and Temporall and the Comons in this p*sent Parliament assembled. That whereas Arthur Creswell Jesuite, who at the tyme of his pfession to be a Jesuite tooke upon hym the Name of Joseph Creswell, Oswald Tesmond Jesuite, and Thomas Winter late of Huddington in the County of Worcester Gentleman, the last day of June in the sower and fortieth yeere of the late Queene Elizabeth of famous memorie, at Valedolide within the Kingdome of Spaine, and at divers other dayes within the same sower and fortieth yeere of the saide late Queene, at Valedolide aforesaide, and elsewhere within the same Kingdome of Spaine, by the meanes pcurement and privitye of Robert Catesby late of Ashby in the County of Northampton Esquire, Frauncis Tresham late of Rushton in the sayd County of Northampton Esquire, and Henry Garnett Jesuite (assuming upon hym to be Superior of the Jesuites within this Realme of England), and others being naturall borne Subjects of this Realme, did traiterouly and against the duety of their Allegeaunce move and incite Philip then and yet King of Spaine, then being at open Enmitie and Hostilitie with the saide late Queene, with force to invade this Kingdome of England, and to joyne with the Papistf and discontented psons within this Realme of England, to depose and ov’throwe the same late Queene of and from her Crowne, and of and from all her Royall Estate Title and Dignide, and to suppresse and abolishe the true Religion of Almighty God truelie and sincerely pfessed within this Kingdome, and to restore the supsddous Romish Religion within the same, and to bring this ancient famous and most renowned Kingdome to utter ruine and miserable Caprivirie under Forraigne Power; And for that the greatest impediment unto the same Invasion would be the want of help of good Horses, the saide Thomas Winter the rather to encourage the same King thereunto, was to offer [unto ‘3 the same King, on the behalfe of the Papistf of England, to give hym assistance p'sently upon the landing of his Forces, with one thowsand five hundred or two thousand Horses; And that for theire better accompli..ing thereof he should moove the same King to furnish the Papistf of England with a good summe of Money, partly to be imployed to pvide and furnish the Horses and partly in Pensions to be employed upon some such as were to be prepared for that service: All which the said Thomas Winter did relate to the sayd King of Spaine, who (the said Kingdomes of England and Spaine then standing in Hostilitie) tooke that offer in verie good part, saying, That he would respect and account of the Catholiques of England (meaning the Papistf) as of his owne Castilians, and thereupon agreed that he would make Invasion and sett foote in England aboute the Spring then nexte following, and would by way of exchange send over unto the Papistf of England one hundred thousand Crownes, to be paied at twoe severall Dayes agreed upon; All which Particulars are extant in the Confession of some of the chiefe Offendors: At which tyme sundrie Papistf of England did extraordinarily furnish themselves by the traiterous and wicked pswasion and meanes of sundry Jesuites, both with Horse and Armour; But before these things could be effected, Almighty God called the said late Queene to his Mercy; Immediately after whose Decease, that is to say, in the same moneth of March wherein shee departed out of this World, Christopher Wrighte late of London Gentleman, was imployed by the sayd Robert Catesby Francis Tresham Henry Garnett and others into Spaine, to negociate with the said King of Spaine by the meanes of the saide Creswell the Jesuite and others, to pceede in that Invasion which the said Thomas Winter had before negociated with hym; And afterward on the two and twentieth day of June in the firste yeere of your Majesties Reigne over this Realme of England, Sir William Staneley Knight, Hugh Owen Esquier, William Baldwine Jesuite and others, did by and with the traiterous pcurement and the consent of the Offendors aforesaide from and out of Flaunders in the partes beyond the Seas, under the Govemement of the Archduke, traiterously employ and send Gwy Fawkes late of London Gentleman unto the saide King of Spaine, to negociat with hym on the behalfe of the saide Papistf of England for Invasion to be had againste this Realme of England, to the same effect as was comitted to the saide Christopher Wright as is aforesaide; And the saide Guy Fawkes and Christopher Wright, though they had all the Furtherance of the saide Creswell the Jesuite that he could give, yet finding no such entertainement with the saide King, who (as by the sequele appeareth) grew into detestacon with the saide pposicons and negotiacbns as they expected or desired, but being wholly disappointed of all theire hopes concerning that matter, the sayd Robert Catesby and divers other psons within this Realme did send over the saide Thomas Winter into the said Country of Flaunders to pcure the said Gwy Fawkes a naturall borne Subjecte of this Realme, and yet a moste traiterous desperate and bloody mynded pson, then serving as a Souldier in the

I A. B. doe truely and sincerely acknowledge pfesse testiffe and declare in my Conscience before God and the Worlde, That our Soveraigne Lorde Kinge James is lawfull and rightfull King of this Realme and of all other his Majesties Dominions and Countries; And that the Pope, neither of himselfe nor by any Authority of the Churche or Sea of Rome, or by any other meanes with any other, hath any Power or Authoritye to depose the King or to dispose any of his Majesties Kingdomes or Dominions, or to authorize any Forraigne Prince to invade or annoy hym or his Countries, or to discharge any of his Subjects of their Allegiaunce and Obedience to his Majestie, or to give Licence or Leave to any of them to beare Armes raise Tumult or to offer any violence or hurte to his Majesties Royall Pson State or Government or to any of his Majesties Subjects within his Majesties Dominions. Also I doe sweare from my heart, that notwithstanding any Declaracbn or Sentence of Excommunicac6n or Deprivac&n made or graunted or to be made or graunted by the Pope or his Successors, or by any Authoritie derived or ptended to be derived from hym or his Sea against the saide King his Heires or Successors, or any Absolution of the saide Subjects from theire Obedience; I will beare Faithe and true Allegiaunce to his Majestie his Heires and Successors, and hym or them will defend to the uttermost of my power against all Conspiracies and Attemptf whatsoever which shalbe made against his or theire persons theire Crowne and Dignitie by reason or colour of any such Sentence or Declarac&n or otherwise, and will doe my best endevour to disclose and make knowen unto his Majestie his Heires and Successors all Treasons and traiterous

Conspiracies which I shall knowe or heare of to be against hym or any of them. And I doe further sweare. That I

doe from my heart abhor detest and abjure as impious and hereticall this damnable Doctrine and Position, that Princes which be excomunicated or deprived by the Pope may be deposed or murthered by theire Subjects or any other whosoever. And I doe beleeve and in my Conscience am resolved, that neither the Pope nor any pson whatsoever hath power to absolve me of this Oath or any parte thereof, which I acknowledge by good and full Authoritye to be lawfully ministred unto mee, and doe renounce all Pardons and Dispensac&ns to the contrarie; And all these things 1 do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and sweare, according to these expresse wordes by me spoken, and according to the playne and comon sense and understanding of the same wordes, without any equivocac&n or mentall evasion or secret reservac&n whatsoever ; And I doe make this recognic&n and acknowledgment heartily willingly and truly upon

the true Faithe of a Christian: So help me God. Unto which Oath so taken, the saide pson shall subscribe

his or her Name or Marke.

And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaide, That no Indictmente or Indictmentf had or found or hereafter to be had or found against any pson or psons for not repairing to some Church or Chappell or usuall Place of Comon Prayer, but absenting him or her selfe by the space of one moneth, contrarie to the Lawes and Statutf in that behalfe pvided, or for not receiving the saide Sacrament contrarie to this p*sent Lawe, nor any Pclamacon Utlawry or other Pceeding thereupon, shall at any tyme hereafter be avoided discharged or reversed by reason of any defaulte in forme or lacke of forme or other defecte whatsoev* (other then by direct traverse to the poynt of not coming to Church or not receiving the saide Sacrament) whereof such pson or psons hath byn or shalbe indicted, but the same Indictment shall stand in force & be pceeded upon; Any such defaulte or forme or other defecte whatsoever notwithstanding.

Provided alwaies, That if any person or persons soe indicted or to be indicted shall at any tyme hereafter submitt and conforme hym or her selfe, and become obedient to the Lawes of the Church of England, and repaire to the Parishe Church of his or her most abiding, and if there be none such then to the Church next adjoyning to his or her such Dwelling, and there heare Divine Service according to the true meaning of the Statute in that behalfe made and pvided, and there publikely receive the saide Sacrament according to the Lawes of this Realme of England now established. That then every such pson and psons so indicted shall and may from thenceforth be admitted and allowed to avoide discharge reverse and undoe the saide Indictment and Indictmentf and all Pceedingf thereupon, in such manner and forme as if this pfeente Acte had not beene had nor made; Any thing herein contained to the contrarie in any wise notwithstandinge.

And for as much as it is found by late Experience that such as goe voluntarily out of this Realme of England to serve Forraigne Princes States or Potentates, are for the most part pverted in their Religion and Loyalty by Jesuites and Fugitives, with whome they doe there converse; Be it therefore enacted by the Authority aforesaide, That everie Subjecte of this Realme that after the Tenth day of June next edming shall goe or passe out of this Realme to serve any Forraigne Prince State or Potentate, or shall after the saide Tenth day of June passe over the Seas, and there shall voluntarily serve any such Forraine Prince State or Potentate, not having before his or theire going or passing as aforesaide, taken the Oathe aforesaide before the Officer hereafter appointed, shalbe a Felon: And that if any Gentleman or p6on of higher Degree, or any pson or psons which hath borne or shall beare any Office or Place of Captaine Lieutenant or any other Place Charge or Office in Campe Armie or Company of Souldiers or Conductur of Souldiers, shall after goe or passe voluntarily out of this Realme, to serve any such Forraine Prince State or Potentate or shall voluntarily serve any such Prince State or Potentate before that hee and they shall become bound by Obligacbn, with Two such Sureties as shall be allowed of by the Officers, which are hereafter by this Acte limited, to take the same Bond unto our Soveraigne Lorde the Kings Majestie, his Heires or Successors, in the Sume of Twentie Poundes of currant Englishe Money at the least, with condi&n to the Effecte following shall be a Felon ; The Tenor of which

CHAPTER XXIII.

An Acte for the newe making up & keeping in Repara eon of Chepstow Bridge.

IN all humble maner shewen and informe your most excellent Majesde, the Inhabitantf of the greatest parte of South Wales, that whereas a certaine greate Bridge of Wood called Chepstowe Bridge, was of late standing over the Water or River of Wye, which parteth the Counties of Monmouth and Gloucester, being the meetest and moste necessary Passage and Highway leading into the parts of Southwales, and out of the same to London Bristoll and other parts of England: And whereas alsoe at a Parliament holden at Westminster in the Eighteenth yeere of the Raigne of the late Queene Elizabeth of famous memory, it was enacted that the Shire or County of Gloucester, and the Shire or County of Monmouth, should stand for evermore chargeable for the maintenance repairing amending and newe making of the aforesaide Bridge when and as often as neede should require, videit, everie of them for such part and moytie as lay to the middle of the Streame of the aforesaide Water of Wye, on the sides of the Lordship of Chepstowe in the County of Monmouth, and the Lordshippe of Tiddenham in the County of Gloucester ; and that for the assessement rating colleccbn gathering and imploying of the Moneyes thereupon to be spent, such forme and order should be observed as was appointed by an Acte made in the two and twentieth yeere of King Henrye the Eight, intituled An Acte concerning repairing and amending of Bridges in Highwayes; And that for the more speedie pformance of the phnysses, it was also enacted, That if the Justices of Peace of the aforesaide Shires of Gloucester or Monmouth or any of them, did make any Defaulte in not appointing executing and observing the order appointed by the saide Acte for the assessement colleccbn and imployment of the Monye soe to be collected according to the meaning of the saide Act, by the space of three Monthes next after the saide Session of Parliament holden in the saide eighteenth yeere of the saide late Queene Elizabeth, that then they and every of them (being resident and inhabiting in the saide Shires) should forfeite for such default the some of Tenne pounds a peece, to be recovered before the then Queenes Majesties Councell in the Marches of Wales, by informa c&n to be imployed to and for the use and reparac&n of the aforesaide Bridge : Forasmuch as the saide Acte made in the saide eighteenth yeere of the saide late Queene is sithence founde to be soe defective and insufficient, as well in the power given thereby to Justices of Peace of the saide Counties for the assessing and rating of the Inhabitantf thereof, and for collecting of Money towards the saide Bridge, as also in the meanes for recoverye of the Penalties thereby imposed upon Justices of Peace of the saide Countyes for theire defaulte in taking order in the p*misses, as that thereby no suche Remedy Benefitt and Order for the mainetenance and reparac&n of the saide Bridge could be effected as was intended to be pvided by the same: And for that by reason thereof the Justices of Peace of either the saide Counties neglecting to take order for the mainetenance and reparac&n of the saide Bridge, the same is of late broken fallen downe and quite caried away with the Streame of the saide Water, whereby the saide Passage and Highway is utterlie taken away, to the greate Charge Griefe Noysance and Hurte of a great multitude of the Kings Majesties Subject? travailing those parts : And for that also the saide Bridge cannot be new made erected or kept in reparac&n without some other and more effectuall Lawe or Pvision to be ordained by Parliament in that behalfe; Be it therefore enacted by the Kinge our SoPaigne Lord and by the Consent of the Lordes Spuall and Temporall and Comons in this jPsent Parliament assembled and by the authorise of the same.

MOST Gratious Soveraigne, as at the first entrance of your Majestie into this Kingdome there appeared universally in all your loving Subjects greater demonstration of Affection towards your Royall Person then ever hath beene observed towards any former King upon a joyfull and forerunning expectation of your Majesties religious just and gratious Govemement; so finding by the grounded experience of Three yeares now compleate of the same yo' happie Government that your Majestie hath turned our hopes into sensible and actuall Benefittf, We cannot but still settle and encrease in Love Zeale and Dutie towards you, which We thinke fitt more and more to make manifest to your Majestie, not by exteme Shewes but by reall Effects; And therefore We your most loving and loyall Subjects being by your Royall Authoritie assembled in Parliament to consult of the great and important Causes of this yo' Kingdome, have entered into due consideration both of yo' Majesties great Benefittf and of yo' present Estate (in the support whereof, the contynuance of those Benefites doth principally consist); Wherein We doe in first place call to minde that by Gods great Mercies and Blessing and yo' Majesties religious Care in Execution of the good Lawes for that purpose ordained, the true Religion of Almightie God freed and delivered from the servitude of blinde and forraigne Superstition, is contynued unto us, and that in such sorte as considering yo' Majesties constant and judiciall profession thereof, and the religious Education of your Children, We rest assured that under Gods Favour we shall comfortably enjoy the same to Us and our Posteritie for ever: Next to Religion and Peace with God, We will remember that univWl Peace of Estate both at Home and Abroade which under yo' Christian and prudent Government We enjoy, whereof Wee have the lesse reason to doubt any interruption, when We behold the greatnes and reputation of your Majesties Power, and the goodnes and excellencie of yo' Royall Disposif&n, whereof the later is not like to give the Cause or Occasion, and the former is like to abate the Courage and Forces of any hostile Attemptf; And lastly we cannot but with unspeakable joy of heart consider of that blessing which having respect to latter times in this State, is rare and unwonted, which is the blessed Fruite and Royall Yssue of singular towardnes and comfort which God hath given to your Majestie with great hope of many the like; these being indeed as Arrowes

in the Hand of the Mightie, able to daunt yor Enemyes, and to assure yo' loving Subjects, and to safegard yo' Royall Person, and to sheild and protect each other, and to be a pledge to Us and our Posteritie of future and pdurable felicitie; These Benefites and Blessingf (dread Soveraigne) amongst many others as We gladly acknowledg to yo' Majesties great Honour and our great Comfort, so neverthelesse having upon mature Advise concluded to present to your Majestie a Guift in proportion and speed of payment exceeding all former presidents of Parliament (the times of Peace considered) We doe further thinke fit to adde and expresse those reasons speciall and extraordinarie which have moved Us therunto least the same our doings may be drawne into president, to the prejudice of the State of our Countrie and our Posteritie: A first and principall reason is, that late monstrous Attempt of that accursed crew of desperate Papistf to have destroyed yor Excellent Majestie, the Queene, and yor Royall Progenie, together with the Reverend Prelates Nobillitie and Comons of this Land assembled in Parliament, to the great confusion yf not subversion of this Kingdome; this barbarous mallice in some unnatural Subjects We have thought fitt to check and encounter with this certaine demonstration of the universall and redoubted love of yor loyall and faithfull Subjects, not only for the present to breede in yor Majestie a more confident Assurance of our utmost Aydes in proceeding with a princely resolution to represse them, and to furnish yo1 Majestie against hostile Aitemptf both by Sea and Land, but also for the future times, to give them their Patrons and Partakers to understand, that yo' Majestie can never want in this Kingdome meanes of Defence of yor Rightes Revenge of yo' Wrongs and Support of yo' Estate : A second reason is, that memorable Benefit wherwith it hath pleased the Divine Providence in great Grace and Favour to blesse this Nation in your Majesties person by addition of another Kingdome, whereby both ancient Hostilities are quite extinguished, and all Footing and Approaches of any Forraigner in this Island are excluded, and yo' Majesties other Dominions the more secured, which happie Event was neverthelesse attended with sundrie rare and necessarie circumstances of Charge now at yo' Majesties first entrance and selling, such as the like hath not been in former times, nor is like to be in succeeding Ages: A third and most urgent reason is, the great and excessive Charge which the unnaturall Warrs of Ireland newly finished before our late renowned Queenes Decease did necessarily impose upon yo' Majestie, by drawing with it a long traine of after Expence even in yo' Majesties time till the Peace thereof were throughlie setled and assured, which Kingdome is now since yo' Majesties time become in the vastest Provinces therof capable of the plantation of Religion Justice Civillitie and Population, and may in no long time arise to be a most profitable and opulent Member of yo' Imperiall Crowne: A fourth reason ariseth from the great contentment and joy which We have in the remembrance of your Majesties most gratious Disposition to the good of yo' People, testified as well at yo' first entrance into this Kingdome by the princely care you tooke out of yo' own Royall Minde to free them by your Proclamation from any burdens of Monopolies and other unlawfull things which then remayned in use, as also of late yo' comfortable Messages sent unto Us during this Session of Parliament purporting the contynuance of like gratious intention towards them, where just occasion of griefe should appeare; which joy of ours hath bred a desire in Us to expresse in more then ordinary maner our extraordinarie and humble Thanks unto yo1 Majestie for the same and to make it appeare on our partes that We will at no time omyt any testimonies of Love and Dutie towards yo' Majestie that may procure or deserve the perfecting and accompli..ing of so princely a worke (so well begun) of Grace and Favour towards Us, it being farre from our dispositions to entertaine any such unthankfullness into our harts as not cheerfully to assist with our Goods and Substance and all other Duties of Subjects such a Soveraigne by whome we find ourselves so tenderly regarded : Thus (gratious Soveraigne) out of these extraordinarie Reasons and Considerations, as also out of our great Love and Affection towards yo' Majesties Person Vertues and Felicities, We doe with all humble and cheerfull Affections present to your Majestie Three Subsidies and Six Fyfteenths and Tenths: And We doe most humblie beseeche your Majestie that it may be enacted by authoritie of this present Parliament in manner and forme following, that is to say: That your Majestie shall have Six whole Fifteenths and Tenthes, to be taken paid and levied of the moveable Goods Chattells and other Things usuall to such Fifteenes and Tenths to be contributorie and chargeable, within the Shires Citties Burroughes Townes and other Places of this yo' Majesties Realme, in maner and forme aforesaid used ;

CHAPTER XIX. (')

An Acte for the Contynuance and Reparacion of a newe buylte Weare uppon the River of Exe, neere unto the

Cittie of Exeter.

IN most humble wyse shewen to yo' most excellent Majestic, yo' true and faythfull Subjects, the Maior Baylifff and Cominaltie of yo' Citie of Exeter, that whereas the said Maio' Baylifff and Chminaltie were seized in their Demesne as of Fee of and in one ancient Weare made of Timber and of Wood, called or commonly knowne by the Name of Callybere Weare, standing upon the River of Exe, and neare to the said Citie, which Weare conveyed sufficient Water from the said River, aswell to all or most of the Griest Mills and Fulling Mills belonging to the sayd Citie, as also unto all the Dyers, and unto many Bakers Brewers Fullers Tuckers Sheermen and other Artificers dwelling neere unto or upon such Streames of Water as weare by meanes of the said Weare conducted and brought unto them: By reason whereof the Inhabitantf of yor Highnes saide Citie were very much releived by the grinding of their Come at the said Mills, and furthered exceedingly b their Artes or Trades of Dying Baking Brewing Fulling Tucking and such like; But the said Weare (about the Feast of the Birth of o’ Lord God last was Two yeares) w* an unusuall and extraordinarie great Frost was foundred or decayed in the Foundation, and afterwards violently torn rent broken into Peeces and carried quyte away, to the great Hinderance of many Hundreds of Artificers and poore People, whose whole Estate and Maintenance depended upon the continuall Use of the same Streames of Water, and to the exceeding Trouble and Hbderance of the Estate of all yor Ma'f said Citie, by reason that the Inhabitantf thereof were inforced not onely to grynd all their Come, but also to tuck and full all their Clothe for the Space of Foure Monthes at the least at other Mills in the Country farr from the said Citie: For Remedie whereof the said Maio' Baylifff and Combaltie were resolved to erect and build again a newe Weare in the same Place, but could not possibly effect the same, for that the said River (having wholly passed with much Violence through the said Breach) had made such a Depth of Water there, that a sound and perfect Foundation for a Weare could not possibly be layd: Whereupon the said Maio' Baylifff and Combaltie (speedilie to prevent the Ruin and Decay of the Inhabitantf of yo' Ma'f said Citie) were inforced to make a newe Weare of Stone overthwart the said River, and about the space of Foure Hundred Foot above the Place where the said former Weare did stand, and also to cutt a newe Milleate or Trench for the Conveyance of the said Water to the said Mills, through a main and strong Rock: For the making of w* said Weare and Milleate, the said Maio' Baylifff and Cominaltie were to their great Charge inforced to bestowe and expende the sume of Two Thousand Marks and more ; In doing whereof the said Maio' Baylifff and Cominaltie were very provident and carefull by all possible Meanes and Devises, to prevent all Hurt and Damage which might thereby ensue to any: Neverthelesse, forasmuch as since the erectbg, buildbg and making of the said Weare and new Milleate, certain persons (being Land Lords Owners Farmo" or Tenantf of certain Lands, some adjoynbg unto and some not farr distant from the said Weare and Milleate) do pretend that by erecting of the said newe Weare, their Grounds are somtymes (more then heretofore) overflowne when by reason of much Raine the said River of Exe doeth exceed his ordinary Greatnes, and doc therefore threaten to sue and ymplead the sayd Mayo' Baylifff and Cominaltie in the Lawe for erecting and making of the said newe Weare where it now standeth and of the said new Milleate, or otherwise to breake it open at those Places whereunto the sayd newe Weare is annexed and where the said new Milleate runneth, w*1 yf they should bdeede doe, then the whole Estate of the sayd Citie should be thereby much decayed, and many nowe using and maintayning themselves and their Families by the said Arts and Trades should be brought to extream Povertie; And although as yet there be not nor apparance is likely to be in future tymes any great Diimage or Losse unto any of the said Landlordf Owners Farmo" or Tenantf more then in tyme past was by the said former Weare, yet because the continuance and mabtenance of the said newe Weare and Milleate is of so great moment to the welfare of the said Citie, as w’^out wch the same cannot well subsist; And that it standeth w,b the rule of Equitie and Justice that those which receive so great benefitt by the same, should yeild competent and sufficient recompence to any person whomesoever receiving or sustayning any losse or detriment thereby, be the same never so small, whereunto the said Maio' Baylifff and Cominaltie doe right humbly and wUl all willbgnes submitt themselves: May it therefore please yo' most excellent Ma“* of yo' most noble and abundant Grace, by and w,h the Assent of the Lords Spirituall and Temporall and

Annis 18° & 19° JACOBI, I. A.D. 1620-1. & 1621-2.

A New Parliament was summoned to meet on the 16th Day of January,

18 Jac. I. A.D. 1620-1; It met, after Two Prorogations, on the 30th of that Month. On the 22d Day of March Two Acts received the Royal Assent, by a Commission dated the 21st, viz.

I. —An Act for the Grant of Two entire Subsidies, granted by the Temporalty.

II. —An Act for Confirmation of the Subsidies granted by the Clergy.

These Acts are not inrolled in Chancery, nor have the Original Acts, to which the Commission was annexed, been found at the Parliament Office ; but they are referred to, by their Titles, in the Calendars there; and also in the several Printed Editions of the Statutes, the earliest obtained being that of Pulton’s Collection, printed A.D. 163 a.

On 4 June 19 Jac. I. A.D. 1621, this Parliament was adjourned to 14 November ensuing, and from thence to the aoth of that Month ; on which Day it met and sate until 19 December, when it was adjourned to 8 February 1621-3, and on that Day was dissolved.

A Roll of this Parliament is preserved in the Rolls Office in Chancery, indorsed “ Rotulus judiciop redditop in Parliamento tens apud Westm anno regni Regis Jacobi Anglie etc. Decimo Octavo.” This is referred to by the Calendar of Acts of Parliament at the Rolls, under “ Anno Decimo Octavo Jacobi R.” as “ An Acte conteyning the Censure geven in Parliament against S' Gyles Mompesson, Sir Frauncis Mitchell, Fraunds Viscount S' Albane Lord Chancellor of England, and Edward Flood.” The Roll contains the several Proceedings in Parliament, and the respective Judgments of the House of Peers against those Offenders.

It appears on Search made in the Exchequer at Westminster, that the Subsidies of the Temporalty & Clergy were actually collected and accounted for; but no Copy of the Acts has been found preserved there.

FORASMUCH as daily Experience sheweth that the nomber and multitude of Banckruptf do increase more and more, and alsoe the Fraudes and Deceits invented and practised for the avoiding and deluding the Penalties of the good Lawes in that Behalfe alreadie made and the Remedy by them pvided; And for that divers Defectf are daily found in the former Statutes made against Banckruptf, both in a description of a Banckrupt, as also in the Power given to the Comissioners for the discovery and distributing the Banckruptf Estate, to the great Incouragement of evill minded psons, the hinderance of Traffique and Commerce, the greate Decay Overthrow and Undoing of many Clothiers, by whome many Thousands of the natural borne Subjects of this Realme be from tyme to tyme in all parts of this Kingdome set on worke; All which do tend to the generall hurt of this Realme: For remedy whereof be it enacted by the Kings most excellent Majestie, the Lords Spirituall and Temporal!, and Comoro in this f?sent Parliament assembled, and by the Authoritie of the same, That all and singuler the aforesaid Statutes and Lawes heretofore made against Banckruptf and for Releife of Creditors, shalbe in all things largelie and beneficially construed and expounded for the Aid Helpe and Releife of the Creditors of such pson or psons as already be or hereafter shall become Banckrupt.

And that all and every pson and psons, using or that shall use the Trade of Merchandize by way of Bargayning Exchaunge Bartering Chevisance or otherwise in Grosse or by Retayle, or seeking his or her Living by buying and selling, or that shall use the Trade or Pfession of a Scrivener, receiving other Mens Moneys or Estates into his Trust or Custodie, who at any tyme after the end of this p*sent Session of Parliament, shall either by himselfe or others by his Pcurement obtayne any Pteccion or Pteccions other then such pson or psons as shalbe lawfully ptected by the Priviledge of Parliament, or shall fferr or exhibit unto his Majestie, his Heires or Successors, or unto any of the Kings Courts any Peticion or Peticions Bill or Bills against his or her Creditor or Creditors, or any of them, thereby desiring or endeavoring to compell or inforce them or any of them to accept lesse then their just and principall Debts, or to pcure tyme or longer daies of Payment, then was given at the time of their original! Contractf, or being indebted to any pson or psons in the some of One Hundred Pounds or more, shall not pay or otherwise compound for the same within Six Monethes next after the same shall growe due, and the Debtor be arrested for the same, or within Six Moneths after an originall Writt sued [put'] to recover the said Debt, and Notice thereof given unto him or left in Writing at his or their Dwelling House or last Place of Aboad ; or being arrested for Debt, shall after his or her Arrest lie in Prison Two Moneths or more, uppon that or any other Arrest or Detencion in Prison for Debt; or being arrested for the some of One Hundred Pounds or more of just Debt or Debts, shall at any tyme after such Arrest escape out of Prison or pcure his Enlargement by putting in comon or hired Bayle, shalbe accompted and adjudged a Banckrupt to all Intentf and Purposes; And in the said Cases of Arrest or lying in Prison for such Debt or Debts, or getting forth by comon or hired Bayle, from the tyme of his or her said first Arrest.

And Be it further enacted by the authoritie of this psent Parliament, That the like Comissions Orders Benefittf and Remedies which are and be provided and lymited by the said former Actes of Parliament made in the Thirteenth yere of the late Queene Elizabeth, and in the First yere of the Raigne of our Soveraigne Lord the Kings Majestie, against any Banckruptf in them or either of them described, or for or concerning his her or their Lands Teneraentf Hereditamentf Fees Anuities Offices Goods Chattellf Wares Merchandize and Debts or any of them, shall and may be had pursued taken and expounded against such pson and psons as are herein and hereby declared described or expressed to be Banckruptf, and against his her and their Lands Tenementf Hereditamentf Fees Anilities Offices Goodes Chattellf Wares Merchandize and Debts, in such manner and forme as the same ought and might have been, if the psons herein declared described or expressed to be Banckruptf, had been by the said Statutf or either of them described to be Banckruptf to all Intentf and Purposes whatsoever.

And Be it further enacted by the authoritie aforesaid, That the same Orders Benefittf and Remedies which are and be provided and lymited by this p>sent Act, against any Banckruptf in or by this Act declared described or expressed to be Banckruptf, or for or concerning his her or their Lands Tenementf Hereditamentf Fees Anuities Offices Goods Chattellf Wares Merchandizes and Debts or any of them or the discovery of them or any of them, shall from henceforth be had pursued taken and expounded against such pson and psons as are declared or expressed to be Banckruptf by the said former Acts of Parliament or either of them, and against his her and their Lands Tenementf Hereditamentf Fees Anuities Offices Goods Chattellf Wares Merchandize and Debts, in such manner and forme as the same ought and might have been, if the psons in the said former Statutf or either of them described to be Banckruptf, had been mencioned and described to be Banckruptf in and by this psent Act.

And Whereas by the former Lawes the Comissioners appointed have Power to examine the Banckrupt himselfe, and such pson or psons as are suspected to have or detayne any of the Estate Goods or Chattellf of the Banckruptf, but some Doubt hath been made whether the Cdmissioners have Power to examine the Wives of the Banckruptf touching the same, by reason whereof the Banckruptf Wives doe daylie conceale and convey away, and cause to be conveyed away much part of their Husbands Moneyes Wares Goods Marchandize and other Estate, to pson or psons unknowne

to any but such Wives, by reason whereof much of the Banckruptf Estate is concealed and detayned from the Creditors: For clearing therefore the said Doubt and avoyding the Inconveniences aforesaid, be it declared and enacted by the Authoritie aforesaid, That after such tyme as any pson shall by the said Comissioners executing the said Comission, or the greater part of them, be lawfully adjudged or declared to be a Banckrupt, the said Cdmissioners executing such Comission shall have power and authoritie to examine uppon Oath the Wife and Wives of all and every such Banckrupt, for the fynding out and discovery of the Estate and Estates Goods and Chattellf of such Banckrupt or Banckruptf concealed kept or disposed of by such Wife or Wives in their own psons or by their owne Act or Meanes, or by any other pson or psons; and that she and they the said Wive and Wives shall incurre such Daunger and Penaltie for not coming before the said Comissioners, or for refusing to be sworne and examined, or for not disclosing the Truth uppon her or their Examinacion or Examinacions as in and by the said former Lawes or either of them is alreadie made and pvided against any other pson or psons in like cases.

And Be it further enacted by the authoritie aforesaid, That if any Banckrupt shall uppon his or her Examinacion or Examinacions to be taken before the said Cdmissioners executing the said Comission, be found fraudulentlie or deceiptfully to have conveyed away his or her Goods Chattellf Lands Tenementf Offices Fees Rents or Anuities or other Estate or any part thereof, to the Value of Twentie Pounds or above, to the End and Purpose to hinder the Execucion of this Statute, or of any other the aforesaid Statutf, or thereby to defraud delay or hinder his or her Creditors of the same, and shall not uppon his or her Examinacion discover unto the said Comissioners, and (if it lie in his or her power) deliver unto the said Comissioners all that Estate Goods and Chattellf so fraudulentlie and deceiptfully conveyed away as aforesaid, or by him or her, his or her meanes, kept or deteyned from the said Comissioners, or that cannott make it appeare unto the said Comissioners that he or she hath sustayned some casuall Losse, whereby he or she is disabled to pay what he or she then owed, shall and may be indicted for such Fraud or Abuse at the Assises or Generali Sessions to be holden before the Judges of Assise or Justices of the Peace of the Countie or Place where he or she shall become Banckrupt; And if uppon such Indictment or Indictmentf the Banckrupt be thereof convicted, he or she soe convicted shalbe sett upon the Pillory in some publique Place, for the space of Two Houres, and have one of his or her Eares nayled to the Pillory and cutt off.

And for that some Doubt is conceived whether the Cdmissioners in case of Resistance have power by the former Lawes to breake open or cause to be broken open the House or Houses of such Banckruptf, which if they have not, the Remedies by the former Lawes given wilbe to little effect: Be it therefore enacted, That in execucion of the said Comission, it shalbe lawfull to and for the said Comissioners, or the greater part' of them, or any pson or psons Officer or Officers by them or the greater part of them to be deputed and appointed, by their Warrant or War ran tf under their Hands and Seales, to breake open the House or Houses Chambers Shoppes Warehouses Doores Trunckf or Chestf of the said Banckrupt, where the said Banckrupt or any of his or her Goods or Estate shalbe or reputed to be, and to seise uppon and order the Body Goods Chattellf Ready Mony and other Estate of such Banckrupt, as by the said former Lawes are lymitted and appointed, whether it be by Imprisonment of his or her Body, or otherwise as to the said Comissioners or the greater part of them shalbe thought meete.

And for the better Division and Distribucion of the Lands Tenementf Hereditamentf Goods Chattellf and other Estate of such Banckrupt, to and amongest his or her Creditors: Be it enacted, That the Comissioners or the greatest part of them, shall and may examine uppon Oath, or by any other Waies or Meanes as to them shall seeme meet, any pson or psons for the fynding out and discovery of the truth and certeintie of the severall Debts due and owing to all such Creditor and Creditors as shall seeke Releif by such course of Comission to be sued forth as aforesaid; And that all and every Creditor and Creditors having Securitie for his or their severall Debts by Judgement Statute Recognizance Specialtie with Penaltie or without Penaltie or other Securitie, or having noe Securitie, or having made Attachment in London or any other place, by vertue of any Custome there used, of the Goods and Chattellf of any such Banckrupt, whereof there is no Execucion or Extent served and executed uppon any the Lands Tenementf Hereditamentf Goods Chattellf and other Estate of such Banckruptf, before such tyme as he or she shall or doe become Banckrupt, shall not be releived uppon any such Judgement Statute Recognizance Specialtie Attachmentf or other Securitie, for any more then a rateable part of their just and due Debts with the other Creditors of the said Banckrupt, without respect to any such penaltie or greater some contayned in any such Judgement Statute Recognizance Specialtie with Penaltie Attachment or other Securitie.

And Be it further enacted, That if it shall happen any the Lands Tenementf Goods Chattellf Debts or other Estate of any Banckrupt to be extended ; after such tyme as he or she is become a Banckrupt, by any pson or psons under colour or pHence of his or their being an Accomptant or any Way indebted unto our Soveraigne Lord the Kings Majestie, his Heires or Successors, that then it shalbe lawful to and for the said Cdmissioners to examine uppon Oath whether the said Debt were due to such Debtor or Accomptant, uppon any Bargaine or Contract originally made betwixt such Accomptant and the said Banckrupt, the said Debtor or Accomptant and his or their Servantf; And if such Bargayne or Contract was originally made to and with any other pson or psons then the said Debtor or Accomptant, or for the use and trust of any other pson or psons, then it shall and may be lawfull to and for the said Comissioners or the greater part of them, to order and dispose of all such Lands Tenementf Hereditamentf Goods Chattellf and Debts soe extended as aforesaid, to and for the use of the Creditors which shall seeke releife by the said Comission, and that the order and disposicion of the said Comissioners or the greater part of them, shalbe good and availeable against the said Extent, and against all psons clayming from by or under the said Extent; And that such pson and

And for that it often falls out that many psons before they become Banckruptf doe convey their Goods to other Men upon good Consideration, yet still doe keepe the same, and are reputed the Owners thereof, and dispose the same as their owne; Be it enacted, That if at any tyme hereafter, any pson or psons shall become Bankrupt, and at such tyme as they shall so become Banckrupt, shall by the consent and pmission of the true Owner and Pprietarie, have in their Possession Order and Disposicion any Goods or Chattellf, whereof they shalbe reputed Owners, and take uppon them the Sale Alteracion or Disposicion as Owners, that in every such Case the said Comissioners or the greater part of them, shall have power to sell and dispose the same to and for the beneiitt of the Creditors which shall seeke Releife by the said Comission, as fully as any other part of the Estate of the Banckrupt.

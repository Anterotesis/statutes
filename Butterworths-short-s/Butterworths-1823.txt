Times since been granted in further Execution of the said Act,

by means of which many useful Roads (to the Extent of Eight

hundred and seventy five Miles) and many Bridges have been made and completed under several Contracts and Agreements entered into according to the Provisions and Regulations of

59 G.3. c. 135. the said Act: And Whereas another Act was passed in the Fifty ninth Year of the Reign of His said late Majesty, intituled An Act to repeal Two Acts made in the Fifty fourth and Fifty fifth Years of the Reign of His present Majesty-, for maintaining and keeping in Repair certain Roads and Bridges in Scotland; 4 to provide more effectually for that Purpose; and for Regulation of Ferries in Scotland: And Whereas the Commissioners appointed in and by virtue of the said first recited Act were appointed Commissioners for the Purposes of the said last recited Act, together with the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland, and the First Commissioner of His Majesty's Woods,

4 Forests and Land Revenues in England> who were by the said last recited Act appointed Commissioners for carrying that Act and also the said first recited Act into Execution; any Three of which Commissioners it was by the said Second recited Act directed should constitute a Quorum, of which one of the Commissioners appointed by virtue of his Office should always be one; and by which Act the said Commissioners were direct* 4 ed to maintain in Repair the before mentioned Roads and Bridges, and also several Roads made in the Course of the last Century for the Purpose of Military Communication in Scotland,

insomuch that nearly Twelve hundred Miles of Road are now under the Care of the said Commissioners: And Whereas, in addition to Five thousand Pounds directed to be annually issued by the Barons of the Exchequer in Scotland, for the Purpose of maintaining in Repair such Roads and Bridges,

certain Assessments were, by virtue of the said last recited Act, directed to be made and levied, in the Manner therein prescribed, upon the Counties wherein any of the Roads and Bridges therein mentioned were situated, and to such an

then and in that Case such County should be further assessed so as to be enabled to repay One Half instead of Three Fourths of the further Sum of Money advanced by the said Commissioners for the Repair of such Roads and Bridges: And Whereas it is become expedient that Power should be given further to increase such Assessments, or to erect Toll Gates upon the said Roads and Bridges, or some of them, for the Purpose of maintaining the same in Repair, in aid of or in lieu of the Assessments so directed to be made and levied on the several Counties, provided such Toll Gates shall not be erected in any County, the Heritors of which shall not have previously signified their Consent thereunto; and moreover it is expedient that the said last recited Act should be altered, in such respects as may be necessary, for the Purpose of enabling the said Commissioners to make such Arrangements as may be required, with the Heritors of the said Counties, or any of them, 4 by reason of the Erection or Non-erection of such Toll Gates:* May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful for the said Commissioners, and they are hereby authorized, to notify (if they shall think fit) to the Heritors and Commissioners of Supply of any County in which any of the aforesaid Roads or Bridges are situated, that the County Assessment, levied by virtue of the last recited Act, together with the Parliamentary Allowance thereby given, is insufficient for the due Repair and Maintenance of the said Roads and Bridges, situated in such County; and that therefore they require the said Heritors and Coinniisaioners of Supply to meet and assemble for the Purpose of considering, whether it will be fit and proper further to increase such Assessments; or that Toll Gates should be erected on any of the said Roads and Bridges within such County, in aid of or in lieu of the Assessment levied in such County; the said Notification to be communicated to the Heritors and Commissioners of Supply, by sending it in Writing to the Convener of such County; and, upon receiving such Notification in Writing, such Convener shall within Three Months thereafter summon and assemble, or cause to be summoned and assembled, the Heritors and Commissioners of Supply (in the Way and Manner in which Heritors and Commissioners of Supply are summoned to meet and assemble in Scotland,) for the Purpose of taking into Consideration the said Notification; and, upon being so summoned, such Heritors and Commissioners of Supply shall meet and assemble accordingly, and come to a Resolution or Resolutions in such Behalf, which Resolution or Resolutions shall forthwith be transmitted to

of their remaining Duties, and that the Duty of Taxation should

4 in future be performed by distinct Taxing Officers, to be ap-

pointed for that Purpose; and that such Taxing Officers should

be paid by Salaries, and not by Fees; but it is deemed more

expedient that the said Duty of Taxation should continue to be

performed as heretofore by the said Masters, and that in lieu of

the Fees recommended for them by the said Commissioners, and

also in lieu of all Fees heretofore payable to them for or in respect of the said Duty of Taxation, or for or in respect of any

other Duty appertaining to the said Office of Master in Ordinary

of the said Court, the said Masters shall respectively receive a

XXXIII. And Whereas it frequently happens that Delays and Adjournments of Meetings on References and Proceedings in the Offices of Masters in Chancery frequently take place, for the Accommodation and Convenience, or through the Negligence and Non-attendance of one of the Parties concerned in such Reference or Proceeding, and it is unreasonable and unjust that the Party attending and prepared to proceed should pay the Expence of Meetings so rendered nugatory by the Non-attendance of the opposite Party, even though such opposite Party should by a final Decree, or otherwise, be ordered to pay the several Costs of the Cause; and according to the present Practice of the Court of Chancery the Masters in Chancery have not any Power or Authority to make any Order touching the Costs of the Proceedings before themselves; Be it therefore enacted, That at any and every Meeting which shall be had before any Master of the Court of Chancery in Ireland, upon Summons issued in Manner aforesaid, the Master shall on the Back of the Summons for such Meeting, to be produced to him according to the Directions of this Act, endorse or cause to be endorsed, and shall sign such Order as under the Circumstances of the Case shall to him seem fit, as to the Payment of the Costs of such Meeting, and as to the Person or Persons by whom the Costs of such Meeting shall be paid, as between Party and Party, or whether such Costs shall abide the Rule, Order or Decree, as to the Payment of Costs, which may be made on the Hearing of the Cause, or whether such Costs shall be paid by the Complainant or Defendant, or other Party in the Cause or Matter, independent of any general Order or Decree which may be pronounced by the Court as to the general Costs of such Cause or Matter, or whether as between Solicitor or Client, the Costs of such Meeting in the Master's Office, so as aforesaid rendered nugatory, shall constitute a fair and reasonable Charge against the Client; and every such Summons with such Order so thereon endorsed, and signed by the said Master, shall, on the Taxation of such Costs, be produced to the Master when taxing such Costs, who shall allow or disallow the Costs in respect thereof accordingly, either as between Party and Party, or as between Solicitor and Client, or otherwise, according to the Order so as aforesaid endorsed on the Back of such Summons; and in no Case shall the Master, upon the Taxation of any Bill of Costs, allow any Sum or Sums as and for the Expences of

any

On all References and Proceedings Summonses to be issued by Master for each Meeting.

IV. And Whereas by the said recited Act, made in the Parliament of Ireland in the Third Year of King George the Second, intituled An Act for the better keeping Churches in Repair, it is amongst other things enacted, that wherever any Archiepiscopal or Episcopal Union of contiguous Parishes, under one Incumbent or Curate, as in the said Act is mentioned, shall be made by any Archbishop or Bishop within his respective Diocese,

the Inhabitants or Occupiers of Land within each and every of such united Parishes respectively shall be obliged to contribute towards the Repair of the Church or Chapel appointed or to be appointed for Public Worship within the said united Parishes, and to the providing all necessary Charges belonging to such Church or Chapel, as if such united Parishes were One 4 entire Parish, and the Church so appointed were the Parish Church of the same; and by the said Act, after reciting that several Parishes are united by Charters granted by the Crown,

4 in some of which there are but very few Protestants inhabiting,

and in others none at all, and the Parish Churches thereof quite ruined or in very great Decay, it is enacted, that until such ruined or decayed Churches are rebuilt or repaired, the Parishioners thereof shall be obliged to contribute to the keeping in Repair the Church to which such Parishes are united, and to the providing all necessary Charges belonging thereto, in like Manner and subject to such Regulations as are by the said Act appointed for the repairing of the Churches united by Archiepiscopal or Episcopal Union: And Whereas by certain Acts of Parliament made in the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in the Forty eighth and Forty ninth Years respectively of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, for making Provision for the building and rebuilding of Churches, Chapels and Glebe Houses in Ireland* the Trustees and Commissioners of the First Fruits of Ecclesiasti-

cal Benefices in Ireland are authorized and empowered to grant by way of Loan, Sums of Money, Interest free, to be applied for the building and rebuilding of Churches and Chapels, to be repaid to them by certain Instalments, after the Rate of Six 4 Pounds for and on every Hundred Pounds so lent and advanced,

until the respective Loans shall be repaid and discharged, such Instalments to be annually assessed and applotted as therein mentioned: And Whereas various Loans have been accordingly made by the said Trustees and Commissioners for the building and rebuilding of Churches and Chapels, and further Loans are likely to be granted for the same Purposes, and also for the repairing of Churches and Chapels, in pursuance of the further Powers hereby granted; and it has happened and may hereafter happen, that Parishes having no Churches, or no Churches fit

V. And Whereas several Parishes in Ireland having no Churches or Chapels, or none fit for the Celebration of Divine Service, are not or cannot, as the Law now stands, be episcopally or by Charter united with other Parishes, though contiguous and having Churches fit for the Celebration of Divine Service; and it is expedient and proper that the Inhabitants of such Parishes, not provided with Churches or Chapels fit for Divine Service, should have and enjoy the Use and Benefit of the Churches convenient to the Districts wherein they reside, and that in consideration of such Use and Enjoyment they should contribute to the Support and Maintenance of such Churches Be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful to and for the respective Archbishops and Bishops in Ireland, within their respective Dioceses, to order and direct, by any Instrument under their Archiepiscopal or Episcopal Seals, that the Inhabitants of any Parish or Parishes within their respective Dioceses, not having a Church or Chapel fit for the Celebration of Divine Service, or that the Inhabitants of any District or Portion of any such Parish shall and may use and resort to the Church of any adjoining Parish fit for Divine Service, in such Instrument mentioned; and that thereupon and from thenceforth, until the Inhabitants of the said Parish or Parishes, or Districts or Portions of Parishes, so unprovided with Churches or Chapels fit for Divine Service as aforesaid, shall build' up or sufficiently repair their Parish Church or Chapel, or until the Archbishop or Bishop shall revoke such Order, which it shall be lawful for him or them to do at any Time by Writing under his or their Archiepiscopal or Episcopal Seal, such Inhabitants -may* lawfully use and resort to such Church of such adjoining Parish as

VI. And be it further enacted, That every such Church of such adjoining Parish, so long as the Inhabitants of any other Parish or District, or Portion of a Parish, shall be permitted to use and resort to the same, shall, so far as respects the Publication of Banns of Marriage, and the Celebration of Marriages, and the Performance and Administration of Divine Service and Sacraments, be and be deemed and taken to be the Church of such Parish or District, or Portion of a Parish: Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall be construed or taken to exempt or discharge the Incumbent of any such Parish or Portion of a Parish, of or from the Cure of the Souls of the Inhabitants thereof; and that if the Parishioners of such Parish or District, or Portion of a Parish, so by this Act or any of the said recited Acts made liable to such Contributions as hereinbefore mentioned, shall at any Time build up or sufficiently repair the Parish Church or Chapel of such Parish, then and from thenceforth such Parishioners, or any of them, shall not be bound or compelled to contribute towards the repairing, building, rebuilding or providing necessary Charges belonging to or towards the Payment of any Instalment of any Loan for or in respect of any other Church or Chapel, excepting in respect of that of the particular Parish to which they immediately and properly belong.

VII. And be it further enacted, That so long and during such Time as all or any of the Inhabitants of the said Parishes respectively, not having Churches or Chapels fit for the Celebration of Divine Service, shall be liable and bound to contribute as aforesaid, and no longer, if shall and may be lawful for such Person* so bound to contribute, to vote at all Vestries to be held for or in respect of the Assessment or Applotment of the Sum or Sums respectively, to and in respect whereof such Contribution is to be made as aforesaid; and that so long as they shall be so bound to contribute, the Churchwarden and Churchwardens of that Parish, to or in respect of the Church whereof such Contribution is to be made, shall be and be deemed and taken as the Churchwarden and Churchwardens of the Parish or District, or Portion of the Parish, the Inhabitants whereof shall be so bound to Contribution as aforesaid, so far only as may respect the Assessments and ApplotmenU of any Sum or Sums for all or any of the Purposes aforesaid, and

by means of which many useful Roads (to the Extent of Eight

hundred and seventy five Miles) and many Bridges have been 4 made and completed under several Contracts and Agreements 4 entered into according to the Provisions and Regulations of

59 G.3. c.135. * the said Act: And Whereas another Act was passed in the Fifty 4 ninth Year of the Reign of His said late Majesty, intituled An 4 Act to repeal Two Acts made in the Fifty fourth and Fifty fifth 4 Years of the Reign of His present Majesty-, for maintaining 4 and keeping in Repair certain Roads and Bridges in Scotland; 4 to provide more effectually for that Purpose; and for Regulation 4 of Ferries in Scotland: And Whereas the Commissioners 4 appointed in and by virtue of the said first recited Act were 4 appointed Commissioners for the Purposes of the said last recited 4 Act, together with the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland, and the First Commissioner of His Majesty's Woods,

4 IV. And Whereas by the said recited Act, made in the Par-

liament of Ireland in the Third Year of King George the Second, 4 intituled An Act for the better keeping Churches in Repair, it is 4 amongst other things enacted, that wherever any Archiepiscopal 4 or Episcopal Union of contiguous Parishes, under one Incumbent or Curate, as in the said Act is mentioned, shall be made 4 by any Archbishop or Bishop within his respective Diocese,

the Inhabitants or Occupiers of Land within each and every 4 of such united Parishes respectively shall be obliged to contnbute towards the Repair of the Church or Chapel appointed or 4 to be appointed for Public Worship within the said united 4 Parishes, and to the providing all necessary Charges belonging 4 to such Church or Chapel, as if such united Parishes were One 4 entire Parish, and the Church so appointed were the Parish 4 Church of the same; and by the said Act, after reciting that 4 several Parishes are united by Charters granted by the Crown,

4 in some of which there are but very few Protestants inhabiting,

4 and in others none at all, and the Parish Churches thereof quite 4 ruined or in very great Decay, it is enacted, that until such 4 ruined or decayed Churches are rebuilt or repaired, the 4 Parishioners thereof shall be obliged to contribute to the keeping in Repair the Church to which such Parishes are united, and 4 to the providing all necessary Charges belonging thereto, in 4 like Manner and subject to such Regulations as are by the said Act appointed for the repairing of the Churches united by 4 Archiepiscopal or Episcopal Union: And Whereas by certain 4 Acts of Parliament made in the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in the Forty eighth and Forty 4 ninth Years respectively of the Reign of His late Majesty King 4 George the Third, for making Provision for the building and rebuilding of Churches, Chapels and Glebe Houses in Ireland* the 4 Trustees and Commissioners of the First Fruits of Ecclesiasti-

4 cal Benefices in Ireland are authorized and empowered to grant 4 by way of Loan, Sums of Money, Interest free, to be applied for 4 the building and rebuilding of Churches and Chapels, to be 4 repaid to them by certain Instalments, after the Rate of Six 4 Pounds for and on every Hundred Pounds so lent and advanced,

4 until the respective Loans shall be repaid and discharged, such 4 Instalments to be annually assessed and applotted as therein 4 mentioned: And Whereas various Loans have been accordingly 4 made by the said Trustees and Commissioners for the building 4 and rebuilding of Churches and Chapels, and further Loans are 4 likely to be granted for the same Purposes, and also for the repairing of Churches and Chapels, in pursuance of the further 4 Powers hereby granted; and it has happened and may hereafter 4 happen, that Parishes having no Churches, or no Churches fit

And Whereas several Parishes in Ireland having no 4 Churches or Chapels, or none fit for the Celebration of Divine 4 Service, are not or cannot, as the Law now stands, be episcopally 4 or by Charter united with other Parishes, though contiguous and 4 having Churches fit for the Celebration of Divine Service; and 4 it is expedient and proper that the Inhabitants of such Parishes,

4 not provided with Churches or Chapels fit for Divine Service,

4 should have and enjoy the Use and Benefit of the Churches convenient to the Districts wherein they reside, and that in consideration of such Use and Enjoyment they should contribute to the 4 Support and Maintenance of such ChurchesBe it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful to and for the respective Archbishops and Bishops in Ireland, within their respective Dioceses, to order and direct, by any Instrument under their Archi-episcopal or Episcopal Seals, that the Inhabitants of any Parish or Parishes within their respective Dioceses, not having a Church or Chapel fit for the Celebration of Divine Service, or that the Inhabitants of any District or Portion of any such Parish shall and may use and resort to the Church of any adjoining Parish fit for Divine Service, in such Instrument mentioned; and that thereupon and from thenceforth, until the Inhabitants of the said Parish or Parishes, or Districts or Portions of Parishes, so unprovided with Churches or Chapels fit for Divine Service as aforesaid, shall build' up or sufficiently repair their Parish Church or Chapel, or until the Archbishop or Bishop shall revoke such Order, which it shall be lawful for him or them to do at any Time by Writing under his or their Archiepiscopal or Episcopal Seal, such Inhabitants -may* lawfully use and resort to such Church of such adjoining Parish as

VIII. And be it further enacted, That wherever, by reason of the Dissolution of any Union or Unions, real or temporary, or from or by reason of any of the Causes aforesaid, or any other lawful Cause, the Inhabitants of any Parish or District, or Portion of any Parish, shall cease to be liable and bound to contribute towards the Payment of any such Instalment or Instalments as aforesaid, payable on or of any Loan or Loans for the building or rebuilding or repairing, or necessary Charges of the Church of any adjoining Parish, to which they may be before bound to contribute as aforesaid, then and in such Case it shall from time to time be thereupon lawful to and for the said Trustees and Commissioners of the First Fruits of Ecclesiastical Benefices in Ireland, and they are hereby required, upon the Petition or Memorial of the Minister or Curate and Churchwardens of the Parish or Parishes remaining liable to the Payment of any such annual Instalment or Instalments, to order and direct, that in lieu and stead of the annual Instalment or Instalments which would otherwise thereupon by Law become due and payable, a smaller and reduced annual Instalment, or Sum or Sums, shall be thereafter paid and payable to the said Trustees and Commissioners, as the only annual Instalment or Instalments of such Loan or Loans, the same to be paid and payable, and to continue to be paid and payable until such Loan or Loans shall be fully and entirely paid off and discharged, and no longer; and from and after the making of any such Orders respectively, the reduced annual Instalment or Instalments therein ordered to be paid, shall be and shall continue to be paid and payable yearly and every Year, until such Loan or Loans shall be fully and entirely paid off and discharged, although Sixteen Years or more may have elapsed since the granting or issuing of such Loan or Loans respectively.

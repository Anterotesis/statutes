Article III. The Captain, Master, Pilot, and Crew of a Vessel condemned as good Prize by virtue of the Stipulations of this Treaty shall be severely punished according to the Laws of the Country of which they are Subjects, as also the Owner of the said condemned Vessel, unless he proves that he had no Participation in the Enterprize.

Article IV. In order more completely to prevent all Infringement of the Spirit of the present Treaty, the Two High Contracting Parties mutually consent that those Ships of their Royal Navies respectively which shall be provided

A.D. 1836. 6° & 7° GULIELMI IV. C. 6. 13

with special Instructions for that Purpose, as herein-after mentioned, may visit such Merchant Vessels of the Two Nations as may upon reasonable Grounds be suspected of being engaged in the Traffic in Slaves, or of having been fitted out for that Purpose, or of having, during the Voyage on which they are met by the said Cruizers, been engaged in the Traffic in Slaves, contrary to the Provisions of this Treaty; and that such Cruizers may detain and send or carry away such Vessels, in order that they may be brought to Trial in the Manner herein-after agreed upon.

In order to fix the reciprocal Right of Search in such a Manner as shall be adapted to the Attainment of the Object of this Treaty, and at the same Time avoid Doubts, Disputes, and Complaints, the said Right of Search shall be understood in the fc Form and according to the Rules following:-

1°. It shall never be exercised except by Vessels of War authorized expressly for that Object, according to the Stipulations of this Treaty.

2°. In no Case shall the Right of Search be exercised with respect to a Vessel of the Royal Navy of either of the Two Powers, but only as regards Merchant Vessels.

3°. Whenever a Merchant Vessel is searched by a Ship of War the Commander of the said Ship shall, in the Act of so doing, exhibit to the Commander of the Merchant Vessel the Document by which he is duly authorized to that End, and shall deliver to him a Certificate, signed by him, stating his Rank in the Naval Service of his Country, and the Name of the Vessel he commands; and which also declares that the only Object of the Search is to ascertain whether the Vessel is employed in the Slave Traffic, or if it is fitted up for the said Traffic: When the Search is made by an Officer of the Cruizer who is not the Commander, the said Officer shall exhibit to the Captain of the Merchant Vessel a Copy of the beforementioned special Orders, signed by the Commander of the Cruizer, and shall in like Manner deliver a Certificate, signed by him, stating his Rank in the Royal Navy, the Name of the Commander by whose Orders he proceeds to make the Search, that of the Cruizer in which he sails, and the Object of the Search, as has been already laid down: If it appears from the Search that the Papers of the Vessel are in regular Order, and that it is employed on licit Objects, the Officer shall enter in the Log Book of the Vessel that the Search has been made in pursuance of the aforesaid especial Orders, and the Vessel shall be left at liberty to pursue its Voyage.

3°. That if at any time the Commander of a Cruizer of either of the Two Nations shall suspect that any Merchant Vessel under the Escort or Convoy of any Ship or Ships of War of the other Nation carries Slaves on board, or has been engaged in the Traffic in Slaves, or is fitted out for the Purpose thereof, the said Commander of the Cruizer shall communicate his Suspicions to the Commander of the Convoy, who, accompanied by the Commander of the Cruizer, shall proceed to the Search of the suspected Vessel; and in case that the Suspicions appear well founded according to the Tenor of this Treaty, then the said Vessel shall be conducted or sent to one of the Points where the Mixed Courts of Justice are stationed, in order that the just Sentence may there be pronounced.

4°. It is further mutually agreed, that the Commanders of the Ships of the Two Royal Navies respectively who shall be employed on this Service shall adhere strictly to the exact Tenor of the aforesaid Instructions.

Article VI. - As the Two preceding Articles are entirely reciprocal, the Two High Contracting Parties engage mutually to make good any Losses which their respective Subjects may incur by the arbitrary and illegal Detention of their Vessels; it being understood that this Indemnity shall be borne by the Government whose Cruizer shall have been

A.D. 1836. 6° & 7° GULIELMI IV. C. 6. 15

guilty of such arbitrary and illegal Detention, and that the Visit and Detention of Vessels specified in the Fourth Article of this Treaty shall only be effected by those British or Spanish Ships which may form Part of the Two Royal Navies respectively, and by such of those Ships only as are provided with the special Instructions annexed to the present Treaty, in pursuance of the Provisions thereof. The Indemnification for the Damages of which this Article treats shall be made within the Term of One Year, reckoning from the Day in which the Mixed Court of Justice pronounces its Sentence.

---

An Act to impose countervailing Duties of Excise on Mixtures, Compounds, Preparations, and Commodities made from or with Spirits removed from Ireland to England or Scotland, or from Scotland to England, and to grant countervailing Drawbacks on the Removal of the same; to repeal the additional Duties of Excise on Licences to Retailers of Spirits in the United Kingdom; and to alter the Laws relating to Distillers and Retailers of Spirits.

[13th August 1836.]

WHEREAS toe Duties by Law charged and payable on

4 Spirits made or distilled in the respective JParts of the United Kingdom are, for every Gallon of Spirits of toe Strength of Hydrometer Proof made or distilled in England, Seven Shillings and Sixpence; for every Gallon of such Spirits made or distilled in Scotland, Three Shillings and Four-pence; and for every

A.D. 1836. 6° & 7° GULIELMI IV. C. 72.

every Gallon of such Spirits made or distilled in Ireland, Two 4 Shillings and Four-pence: And whereas such Differences in the respective Amounts of the said Duties operate unfairly and unjustly on the Manufactures of all Mixtures, Compounds, and Pre*parations into the Manufacture of which Spirits enter as the Basis, or a principal Ingredient or Material thereof, and injuriously to the Revenue when such Articles are manufactured in and removed from that Part of the United Kingdom paying the lower Duty into those Parts of the United Kingdom in which the higher Duties are charged and paid, and also further operate as Prohibitions to the Removal of such Articles from those Parts of the United Kingdom paying the higher Duty to the Parts in which the Excise Duties are chargeable: And whereas by the respective Acts of Union between England and Scotland and ' Great Britain and* Ireland it is intended that all the Subjects of the United Kingdom should as far as possible be placed on an Equality in respect of Trade and Manufactures, and it is therefore necessary and expedient, in conformity with such Intention,

that countervailing Duties should be imposed on the Removal from Ireland to England or Scotland, or from Scotland to England, of the respective Mixtures, Compounds, Preparations, and Commodities in the Schedule to this Act mentioned, according to the Quantity of Proof Spirit usually employed in the manufacturing and compounding of the same, and that corresponding Drawbacks should be allowed: And whereas by an Act passed *4 in the Fourth and Fifth Years of His Majesty's Reign, intituled An Act to repeal the Duties on Spirits made in Ireland, and to impose other Duties in lieu thereof, and to impose additional Dudes on Licences to Retailers of Spirits in the United Kingdom, certain additional Duties of Excise were imposed on Excise

Licences taken out by Retailers of Spirits in Great Britain and Ireland: And whereas it is expedient to repeal the said additional Duties: And whereas it is expedient to allow Spirits made or distilled in the United Kingdom to be warehoused in Casks of a lesser Size than Eighty Gallons, and to remove the Restriction on Retailers of Spirits not to have more than Ten 4 Gallons of Spirits of Wine in Stock, and to repeal so much of an Act passed in the Second Year of His Majesty's Reign, intituled An Act to reduce the Allowance on Spirits made from Malt only in Scotland and Ireland, as prevents any Distiller in Scotland and Ireland from giving Notice to distil from Malt during the Remainder of his Licence, after having distilled from raw Grain, and to restore the Provision contained in an Act passed in the

Fourth Year of the Reign of His Majesty King George the ' Fourth Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the First Day of September One thousand eight hundred and thirty-six there shall be raised, levied, collected, and paid unto His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, upon the several Mixtures, Compounds, Preparations, and Commodities mentioned and described in the Schedule to this Act annexed, on the Removal of tho same from Ireland to Scotland or England, or from Scotland

II.

XXVI. And whereas by the herein-before recited Act passed in the Fourth and Fifth Years of His Majesty's Reign the Lord Lieutenant or other Chief Governor or Governors of Ireland, and His Majesty's Privy Council there, are empowered, on the Recommendation of the said Ecclesiastical Commissioners, to order and direct that the Appointment to 'any Ecclesiastical Dignity or Office under the Rank of an Archbishoprick or Bishoprick, the Person holding which shall not have actual Cure of Souls within any Parish appropriated thereto, shall be suspended upon the next Avoidance until such Lord Lieutenant and Council shall think fit otherwise to direct, and that for and during such Period as such Dignity or Office shall remain vacant all and every the Tithes, Glebes, Lands, Rents, Profit^ and Emoluments whatsoever belonging or appertaining thereto, and all Arrears of such Tithes, Rents, Profits, and Emoluments which may have accrued due since the same may have become void as aforesaid, shall be vested in and received by the said Ecclesiastical Commissioners, to be by them applied towards the like Purposes as the other Monies and Funds accruing to or vested in them under the Provisions of the said Act: And whereas Doubts have arisen whether the Provisions of the said Act apply to the Case of the Precentorship of the Church of the Hedy and Undivided Trinity, otherwise called Christ Church, in Dublin, 4 now vacant, by reason of the Cure of Souls in certain Parishes belonging in contemplation of Law to the said Precentor, 4 although in fact such Cure has not been served by the Occupant of such Dignity, nor by any resident Curate employed at a 4 sufficient Stipend: And whereas it is expedient to remove such Doubts, and also further to explain the said Act be it therefore enacted, That the herein-before recited Provisions of the said Act shall be taken to extend to the Baid Precentorship, and also to all Dignities or Offices the Occupants whereof, although having in contemplation of Law Cure of Souls, habitual or actual, in any Parish or Parishes appropriated or in anywise belonging thereto, shall not for Three Years next preceding the First Day of January last have continuously served the Cure of Souls in such Parish or Parishes, either personally or by a Curate licensed thereto, or in case the Appointment, Presentation, or Collation of any Clerk to such Parish or Parishes shall have been suspended or hereafter shall be suspended under and by virtue of the said recited Act of the Third and Fourth Years of His present Majesty's Reign; and also that the said Provisions of the said Act shall be taken to extend to all such Offices of or belonging to Cathedral Churches as in the said Act ifientioned, although the same may not be Ecclesiastical Offices nor held by Ecclesiastical Persons, and also to all Cases where Tithes may have been held or enjoyed by the Occupants of such Dignities or Offices, though not in Law

Commissioners may permit their Tramroads to be used by Persons paying for same.

XX. And whereas it is expedient that a new Provision should be made for Payment of the Salary of the Harbour Master of ' said Kingstown Harbour, and that the Powers now vested in

the said Harbour Master under the said Act of the First Year of the Reign of king George the Fourth should be enlarged and ' more explicitly defined, and that proper Powers should be given ' to the said Commissioners for the Appointment of Collectors

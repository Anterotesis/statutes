equal to their Support, and the said Hospital is capable of accommodating little more than One Third Part of such of the said

Children as having attained the Age of Eight Years, ought by the Rules thereof to be taken from their respective Nurses and brought into the said Hospital for Education and Instruction; and it is expedient that the Benefits of the said Institution should be confined to Orphans and deserted Children whose Parents are

III. And be it further enacted, That from and after the said First Day of November One thousand eight hundred and twenty two, no Child shall be received or admitted into the said Hospital, unless instead of the Certificate heretofore required for the Admission of any Child into the said Foundling Hospital, there shall be delhrerea to the Porter of the said Hospital, subject to the

II. And Whereas, for the better and more effectually enabling the said Commissioners to ascertain whether the Introduction of 1 a more uniform Practice in the Management of the Public Revenue in Great Britain and Ireland would not be beneficial, it is i expedient that the said Commissioners should be empowered to 1 , call for such Accounts and Papers, and to require the Attendance of such Persons employed in the Collection and Management 1 of the Revenues of Customs and Excise in England, as may enable the said Commissioners to ascertain the Mode of Managing and ' Collecting the said Revenues Be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful for the said Commissioners to call for and require all such Accounts and Papers, and to require the Attendance of all such Persons as may, in the Judgment of the said Commissioners, be necessary to enable the said Commissioners to ascertain the Mode of managing and collecting the said Revenue of Customs and Excise in England.

An Act for the further and more adequate Punishment of Persons convicted of Manslaughter! anil of Servants convicted of robbing their Masters, and of Accessories before the Fact to Grand Larceny, and certain other Felonies.

[24th June 1822.]

WHEREAS the Punishment of burning in the Hand has long 1 W been deemed ineffectual and inexpedient: And Whereas ' the other Punishments which may by Law be indicted upon (Persons convicted of the Offence of Manslaughter are frequently ' inadequate to the aggravated Circumstances of such Onence Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act, whenever any Person shall be lawfully convicted of the Offence of Manslaughter, such Person shall not be liable to be burned or marked in the Hand, or in any Part thereof, but such Person shall be liable to be transported beyond the Seas for the Term of his or her natural Life, or for any Term of Years, as the Court before which any such Person shall be convicted shall adjudge; or shall be liable, in case the said Court shall think fit, to be imprisoned only, or to be imprisoned and kept to hard Labour in the Common Gaol, House of Correction or Penitentiary House, for any Term not exceeding Three Years; or shall be liable to such a pecuniary Fine, as to the said Court, in its Discretion, shall seem meet; and such Fine or other Punishment imposed by virtue of this Act shall have the like Effects and Consequences to the Party on whom such Fine or other Punishment shall be so imposed, with respect to any Discharge from the same or other Felonies, or any Restitution to his or her Estates, Capacities and Credits, as if he or she had continued liable to the former Punish-meat of burning or marking in the Hand, and had suffered such former Punishment.

H. And Whereas frequent Depredations have of late been committed by Clerks, Apprentices, and Servants, to the serious De-

triment and Loss of their Masters, Mistresses or Employers; and

it is expedient that such Offenders, when entitled to Benefit of Clergy, should be made liable to a more severe Punishment, than can now by Law be inflicted Be it therefore further enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, if any Clerk, Apprentice or Servant whatsoever, shall feloniously steal any Goods, Chattels, Money, Bond, Bank Note, Cheque upon a Banker or Banker's Draft, Promissory Note for the Payment of Money, Bill of Exchange, or other valuable Security or Effects, from or belonging to, or in the Possession, Custody or Power of his, her or their Master or Masters, Mistress or Mistresses, or Employer or Employers, and shall be lawfully convicted thereof, and be entitled to the Benefit of Clergy, then and in every such Case such Offender or Offenders, instead of being subjected to such Punishment as may now by Law be inflicted upon Persons so convicted, and entitled to the Benefit of Clergy, may, at the Discretion of the

III. And Whereas Children, Servants and others, are often induced to commit Thefts, by the Persuasion, Instigation or 1 Commands of wicked and evil disposed Persons, who, not being present, aiding and assisting in the Commission of such Thefts, 1 frequently escape the Punishment which so mischievous an Offence ' demands; Be it therefore further enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, if any Person or Persons shall counsel, hire, procure or command any other Person or Persons to commit any Larceny whatsoever of the Degree of Grand Larceny, then and in every such Case, if the Person or Persons so counselling, hiring, procuring or commanding as aforesaid, shall be convicted of Felony, and shall be entitled to the Benefit of Clergy, and by the Laws now in force shall be liable to be fined and imprisoned for any Term not exceeding One Year only, he, she or they, instead of being so fined and imprisoned as aforesaid, may, at the Discretion of the Court by or before which any such Offender shall be convicted, be ordered and adjudged to be transported beyond the Seas for the Term of Seven Years, or to be imprisoned only, or to be imprisoned and kept to hard Labour, in the Common Gaol, House of Correction or Penitentiary House, for any Term not exceeding Three Years.

An Act to authorize certain temporary Advances of Money, for the Relief of the Distresses existing in Ireland.

[26th July 1822.]

WHEREAS by reason of the Distress that exists in many Parts of Ireland, it is in many Counties thereof impossible, without great Severity and great Mischief to the Country. ' to levy and raise the Sums heretofore presented by the Grand ' Juries of such Counties respectively, and which ought by Law 1 to be levied and raised on or within the said Counties respectively s And Whereas the Roads and Works and other Objects

and Purposes for which many of the said Sums have been pre-(seated cannot be delayed without great Injury to the Persons in* (terested therein, and the Commencement of such Works, by em-(ploying the Poor, must tend to alleviate the existing Distress: And Whereas in some Parts of Ireland the Grand Juries, from

a Sense of the Distresses of the Country, have declined to make ' Presentments for the Repair of useful Roads, and other existing

Public Works which stand in need of Repair; and such Repairs,

if executed at this time, must afford considerable Relief to the ' Distresses of the Poor in those Places respectively: And Whereas, moved by the Considerations aforesaid, His Excellency the

Lord Lieutenant of Ireland hath issued Orders to several Treasuress of Counties, Counties of Cities or Counties of Towns, in 1 Ireland, to withhold their Warrants for the levying of* the said ' Sums, so presented, to be raised on or within their respective

Counties, Counties of Cities or Counties of Towns, or some

Parts or Proportions of such Sums respectively, or to recal such ' Warrants if previously issued; and the said Lord Lieutenant of

An Act to explain an Act of the Fifty third Year of the Reign of His late Majesty, respecting the Enrolment of Memorials of Grants of Annuities.

[29th July 1822.]

WHEREAS by an Act of Parliament made and passed in

the Fifty third Year of the Reign of His late Majesty

King George the Third, intituled An Act to repeal an Act of the Seventeenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled An Act for registering the Grants of Life Annuities, and for the better Protection of Irfants against suck Grantr, ' and to sub* 1 stitute other Provisions in lieu thereof it is enacted, That within Thirty Days after the Execution of every Deed, Bond, Instrument or other Assurance, whereby any Annuity or'Rent Charge

shall, from and after the passing of the said Act, be granted

for One or more Life or Lives, or for any Term of Years or greater Estate determinable on One or more Life or Lives, a 4 Memorial of the Date of every such Deed, Bond, Instrument or other Assurance of the Names of all the Parties, and of all' 4 the Witnesses thereto, and of the Person or Persons for whose Life or Lives such Annuity or Rent Charge shall be granted,

and of the Person or Persons by whom the same is to be beneficially received, shall be enrolled in the High Court of Chancery, in the Form or to the Effect following, with such Alterations therein as the Nature and Circumstances of any particular Case

may reasonably require: And Whereas the Form or Effect to

which

which such Enactment refers is expressed in several Columns,

at the Head of One of which are the Words, 44 Names of Witnesses," and underneath, as applicable to Indentures of Lease and Release, the Letters and Words 44 E. F. of' 44 G. H. of" and

as applicable to a Bond and Warrant of Attorney to confess Judgment, the Letters 44 E. F." 44 G. H." without the Word of And Whereas the Words of Enactment referring to such Form express only that a Memorial of the Names of all the Witnesses to every such Deed, Bond, Instrument or other Assurance as therein mentioned, should be enrolled as directed by the said Act, without providing that any Description of the Witnesses ' should be given in such Memorial, except as such Form is thereby referred to; and such Form does not provide that any Description should be added to such Names except by the Addition of the Word 44 of" to the Letters 44 E. F." and 44 G. H." as aforesaid, as applicable to Indentures of Lease and Release:

And Whereas in consequence of such indistinct Enactment it may ' be doubtful, whether it was the Intention of the Legislature to require any, or if any, what Description to be added to the Names

of Witnesses in the Memorial of any Deed, Instrument or As-\ surance to be enrolled as aforesaid: And Whereas a very great Number of Memorials of Grants of Annuities have, since the ' passing of the said Act, been enrolled, in which the Names of the Witnesses to the Deeds, Instruments or Assurances specified ' in such Memorials, have been inserted without the Adaition of the Place of Abode of such Witnesses; and it has been inferred, from the Use of the Word 44 of" after such Letters E. F." and after such Letters " G. H." as aforesaid, that it was necessary to describe each of such Witnesses in such Memorial as of some Place, and in consequence thereof some Grants of Annuities made since the passing of the said Act have been, in Proceedings in summary Applications to Courts of Justice, which cannot be reviewed in any Superior Court, deemed null and void, on the Ground that no Description of the Place of Abode of the Witnesses to some or one of the Deeds, Instruments or Assurances by which such Grants of Annuities have been made, had been inserted in the Memorials or Memorial thereof enrolled as directed by the said Act: And Whereas

Doubts have been entertained whether the Construction so put on the said Act is the true Construction thereof, more especially as the same is so far penal as it renders Deeds, Instruments and Assurances, of which Memorials have not been enrolled in pursuance of the said Act, null and void, and the Provisions in the said Act are not so clear and explicit as the same ought 4 to' have been under such Circumstances, and the Parties claiming under Grants of Annuities may have been thereby misled, and induced to conceive that it was not necessary under the Provisions of the said Act to insert in the Memorial of any Deed, Instrument or Assurance to be enrolled as aforesaid, the Place or Places of Abode of the Witness or Witnesses to such Deed, Instrument or Assurance, or any more than the Name or Names of such Witness or Witnesses, there being no Words in the said Act expressly requiring any more to be so inserted, nor any 1 Words from which it could be inferred that any more was re-

quired to be so inserted, except the Word " of' after the Letters " £. F." and 44 G. H." respectively, with reference to one ' Species of Assurance inserted in the form of Memorial before mentioned; and it is expedient to remove all Doubts touching the Construction of the said Act, with respect to so much of the Memorials required by the said Act to be enrolled as relates to any Description of the Witness or Witnesses to any Deed,

Instrument or Assurance May it therefore please Your Majesty, that it may be enacted and declared; And be it enacted and declared by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That by the said Act of the Fifty third Year of the Reign of His said late Majesty, no further or other Description of the subscribing Witness or Witnesses to any Deed, Bond, Instrument or other Assurance, whereby any Annuity or Rent Charge is or may be granted, is required in the Memorial thereof, Resides the Names of all such Witnesses; and so the said Act shall be deemed, construed and taken.

II. And Whereas Doubts have also arisen, whether under the ' said Act of the Fifty third Year of the Reign of His said late Majesty, the Omission to enrol a Memorial of any one of the

Assurances for securing any Annuity or Rent Charge does not ' vitiate the whole Transaction, notwithstanding the Enrolment of

a Memorial of another Deed, Bond, Instrument or other Assurance granting the same; and it is also expedient to remove such Doubts; Be it therefore fbrther enacted and declared, That every Deed, Bond, Instrument or other Assurance granting any Annuity or Rent Charge, and of which a Memorial shall have been or shall be duly enrolled pursuant to the said Act, notwithstanding the Omission to enrol any other Deed, Bond, Instrument or Assurance for securing such Annuity or Rent Charge, shall be valid and effectual, according to the Intent, Meaning and true Effect thereof, notwithstanding a Memorial of any other Deed, Bond, Instrument or Assurance for securing the same Annuity shall not have been duly enrolled pursuant to the said Act.

claims certain Arrearages from the Province of Lower Canada,

on account of such Drawbacks, which Claims are not admitted ' on the Part of the Province of Lower Canada; and it further ' appears by the Report of the said Commissioners, appointed on ' behalf of both Provinces for the Purposes aforesaid, that they ' have failed to establish any Regulation for the Period beyond

the First Day of July One thousand eight hundred and nineteen,

XXVII. And Whereas by a certain Act of the Parliament of Great Britain passed in the Fourteenth Year of His late Majesty's Reign, intituled An Act to establish a Fund towards farther defraying the Charges of the Administration of Justice and Support of the Civil Government within the Province of Quebec in America, certain Duties were imposed upon Goods and Commodities imported into the said Province, which Duties are by the said Act directed to be applied, under the Authority of the Lord High Treasurer, or Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, in making a more certain and adequate Provision towards defraying the Expence of the Administration of Justice, and the Support of the Civil Government in the said Province of Quebec $ 4 and since the Division of the said Province of Quebec into the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, it has been contended,

on behalf of the said Provinces, that the Proceeds of such Duties should be distributed between the said Two Provinces in proportion to the Amount of Expences defrayed by each respectively towards the Administration of Justice and the Support of its Civil Government, and not in proportion to the estimated Consumption within either Province of the Articles upon which such Duties shall have been paid Be it therefore enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Arbitrators to be appointed, from time to time, for the Purpose of establishing the Proportion which shall be paid to Upper Canada, of such Duties as now are, or hereafter may be imposed, by Acts passed in the Province of Lower Canada, to receive the Claims in behalf of each Province with respect to its Proportion of Duties levied under the said Act passed in the Fourteenth Year of His said late Majesty's Reign, since the Expiration of the last Provisional Agreement heretofore ratified between the said Two Provinces, or which may hereafter be levied under the Authority of the said Act, upon Goods and Commodities imported into Lower Canada, and to report the same, with the Evidence thereon, to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for the time being, in order that they may make such Order respecting the Proportion in which the same shall be expended within each of the said Provinces respectively, for the Purposes mentioned in the said Act, as to them shall seem meet: Provided always nevertheless, that until such Order shall be made by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury as aforesaid, the Proceeds of such Duties shall be distributed in the same Proportion between the said Two Provinces, as the Duties levied under the Provincial Acts of the Province of Lower Canada within the same Period, subject nevertheless to be increased or diminished, as respects either of the said Provinces, by any subsequent Order of the said Lords Commissioners, extending to the Period for which no such Order had before been made.

XXVIII. And Whereas the Division of the Province of Quebec, into the Two Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, was intended for the common Benefit of His Majesty's Subjects re-

siding within both of the newly constituted Provinces, and not in any manner to obstruct the Intercourse or prejudice the Trade

to be carried on by the Inhabitants of any Part of the said late Province of Quebec with Great Britain, or with other Countries; and it has accordingly been made a Subject of mutual Stipulation between the said Two Provinces, in the several Agreements which have heretofore subsisted, that the Province of Upper Canada should not impose any Duties upon Articles imported from Looser Canada, but would permit and allow the Province of Lower Canada to impose such Duties as they might think fit, upon Articles imported into the said Province of Lower Canada; of which Duties a certain Proportion was by the said Agreements appointed to be paid to the Province of Upper Canada: And Whereas in consequence of the Inconveniences arising from the Cessation of such Agreements above recited, it has been found expedient to remedy the Evils now experienced in the Province of Upper Canada, and to guard against such as might in future arise from the Exercise of an exclusive Controul, by the Legislature of Lower Canada, over the Imports and Exports into and out of the Port of Quebec; and it is further expedient, in order to enable the said Province of Upper Canada to meet the necessary Charges upon its ordinary Revenue, and to provide with sufficient certainty for the Support of its Civil Government, to establish such Controul as may prevent the Evils which have arisen or may arise from the Legislature of Lower Canada suffering to expire unexpectedly, or repealing suddenly, and without affording to Upper Canada an Opportunity of Remonstrance, existing Duties, upon which the principal Part of its Revenue, and the necessary Maintenance of its Government may depend Be it therefore enacted, That all and every the Duties which, at the Time of the Expiration of the last Agreement between the said Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, were payable under any Act or Acts of the Province of Lower Canada, on the Importation of any Goods, Wares or Commodities into the said Province of Lower Canada (except such as may have been imposed for the Regulation of the Trade by Land or Inland Navigation, between the said Province and the United States of America) , shall be payable and shall be levied according to the Provisions contained in any such Acts, until any Act or Acts for repealing or altering the said Duties, or any Fart thereof respectively, shall be passed by the Legislative Council and Assembly of the said Province of Lower Canada, and until such Act or Acts, repealing or altering such Duties, shall, after a Copy thereof has been transmitted to the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or Person administering the Government of the Province of Upper Canada, be laid before both Houses of the Imperial Parliament, according to the Forms and Provisions contained in a certain Act of the Parliament of Great Britain, passed in the Thirty first Year of the Reign of His said late Majesty, intituled An Act to repeal certain Parts of an Act passed in the Fourteenth Year of His Majesty's Reign, intituled An Act for

A.D. 1822. 3° GEO. IV. C. 119. 661

making more effectual Provision for the Government of the Province of Quebec, in North America, ' and to make further Provision for the Government of the said Province, and the Royal Assent thereto proclaimed within the Province of Lower Canada, according to the Provisions of the said last mentioned Act.

XXIX. And be it further enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, no Act of the Legislature of the Province of Lower Canada* whereby any additional or other Duties shall or may be imposed on Articles imported by Sea into the said Province of Lower Canada, and whereby the Province of Upper Canada shall or may in any respect be directly or indirectly affected, shall have the Force of Law until the same shall have been laid before the Imperial Parliament, as provided in certain Cases by the said Act passed in the Thirty first Year of His said late Majesty's Reign, and the Royal Assent thereto published by Proclamation in the said Province of Lower Canada, a Copy of such Act having, r within One Month from the Time of presenting the same for the Royal Assent in the said Province, been transmitted by the Governor, Lieutenant Governor or Person administering the Government of the Province of Lower Canada, to the Governor, Lieutenant Governor or Person administering the Government of the Province of Upper Canada: Provided always nevetheless, that it shall not be necessary to transmit any such Act to be laid before the Imperial Parliament, if, before the same shall have been presented for the Royal Assent within the said Province of Lower Canada, the Legislative Council and House of Assembly of the said Province of Upper Canada shall, by Address to the Governor, Lieutenant Governor or Person administering the Government of the said Province of Upper Canada, pray that their Concurrence in the Imposition of the Duties intended to be imposed by such Act may be signified to the Governor, Lieutenant Governor or Person administering the Government of the said Province of Lower Canada.

XXX. And Whereas it is expedient that the Productions of the Province of Upper Canada should be permitted to be exported without being made subject by any Act of the Province of Lower Canada, either directly or indirectly, to Duties or Impositions on their Arrival in that Province, or in passing through the Waters thereof:' Be it enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, all and every the Boats, Scows, Rafts, Cribs and other Craft belonging to any of His Majesty's Subjects, and coming from the Province of Upper Canada into the Province of Lower Canada, not laden with the Productions of any Foreign Country, shall be allowed freely to pass into and through the said Province, and shall not be subject to any Rate, Tax, Duty or Imposition, other than any Charge which may now exist for Pilotage, or which may now be established for Toll at any Lock or other Work now actually erected on the navigable Waters thereof; any Law, Statute or Usage of the Province of Lower Canada to the contrary notwithstanding; and that the Expence of improving the Navigation of the Waters of the River Saint Lawrence shall in future be defrayed by such Measures and in such Proportions as the Arbitrates to be appointed under the Provisions of this Act

changed: And Whereas it may materially tend to the Improvement of such Lands, and to the general Advantage of the said

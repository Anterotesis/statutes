[24th June 1822.]

WHEREAS the Punishment of burning in the Hand has long 1 W been deemed ineffectual and inexpedient: And Whereas ' the other Punishments which may by Law be indicted upon ( Persons convicted of the Offence of Manslaughter are frequently ' inadequate to the aggravated Circumstances of such Onence Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act, whenever any Person shall be lawfully convicted of the Offence of Manslaughter, such Person shall not be liable to be burned or marked in the Hand, or in any Part thereof, but such Person shall be liable to be transported beyond the Seas for the Term of his or her natural Life, or for any Term of Years, as the Court before which any such Person shall be convicted shall adjudge; or shall be liable, in case the said Court shall think fit, to be imprisoned only, or to be imprisoned and kept to hard Labour in the Common Gaol, House of Correction or Penitentiary House, for any Term not exceeding Three Years; or shall be liable to such a pecuniary Fine, as to the said Court, in its Discretion, shall seem meet; and such Fine or other Punishment imposed by virtue of this Act shall have the like Effects and Consequences to the Party on whom such Fine or other Punishment shall be so imposed, with respect to any Discharge from the same or other Felonies, or any Restitution to his or her Estates, Capacities and Credits, as if he or she had continued liable to the former Punish-meat of burning or marking in the Hand, and had suffered such former Punishment.

That within 4 Thirty Days after the Execution of every Deed, Bond, Instrumentor other Assurance, whereby any Annuity or'Rent Charge

shall, from and after the passing of the said Act, be granted

for One or more Life or Lives, or for any Term of Years or 4 greater Estate determinable on One or more Life or Lives, a 4 Memorial of the Date of every such Deed, Bond, Instrument 4 or other Assurance of the Names of all the Parties, and of all' 4 the Witnesses thereto, and of the Person or Persons for whose 4 Life or Lives such Annuity or Rent Charge shall be granted,

and of the Person or Persons by whom the same is to be beneficially received, shall be enrolled in the High Court of Chaneery, in the Form or to the Effect following, with such Alterations 4 therein as the Nature and Circumstances of any particular Case

may reasonably require: And Whereas the Form or Effect to

4 at the Head of One of which are the Words, 44 Names of Witnesses," and underneath, as applicable to Indentures of Lease 4 and Release, the Letters and Words 44 E. F. of' 44 G. H. of" and

as applicable to a Bond and Warrant of Attorney to confess 4 Judgment, the Letters 44 E. F." 44 G.

F." and 44 G. H." as 4 aforesaid, as applicable to Indentures of Lease and Release:

< And Whereas in consequence of such indistinct Enactment it may ' be doubtful, whether it was the Intention of the Legislature to 4 require any, or if any, what Description to be added to the Names

< of Witnesses in the Memorial of any Deed, Instrument or As-\ surance to be enrolled as aforesaid: And Whereas a very great 4 Number of Memorials of Grants of Annuities have, since the ' passing of the said Act, been enrolled, in which the Names of 4 the Witnesses to the Deeds, Instruments or Assurances specified ' in such Memorials, have been inserted without the Adaition of 4 the Place of Abode of such Witnesses; and it has been inferred, from the Use of the Word 44 of" after such Letters 4 " E.

Doubts have been entertained whether the Construction so put 4 on the said Act is the true Construction thereof, more especially 4 as the same is so far penal as it renders Deeds, Instruments 4 and Assurances, of which Memorials have not been enrolled in 4 pursuance of the said Act, null and void, and the Provisions 4 in the said Act are not so clear and explicit as the same ought 4 to' have been under such Circumstances, and the Parties claiming 4 under Grants of Annuities may have been thereby misled, and 1 induced to conceive that it was not necessary under the Provisions of the said Act to insert in the Memorial of any Deed, 4 Instrument or Assurance to be enrolled as aforesaid, the Place 4 or Places of Abode of the Witness or Witnesses to such Deed, 4 Instrument or Assurance, or any more than the Name or Names 4 of such Witness or Witnesses, there being no Words in the said 4 Act expressly requiring any more to be so inserted, nor any 1 Words from which it could be inferred that any more was re-

claims certain Arrearages from the Province of Lower Canada,

' on account of such Drawbacks, which Claims are not admitted ' on the Part of the Province of Lower Canada; and it further ' appears by the Report of the said Commissioners, appointed on ' behalf of both Provinces for the Purposes aforesaid, that they ' have failed to establish any Regulation for the Period beyond

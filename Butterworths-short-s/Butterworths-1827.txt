LXXV.

That it shall be lawful for any Constable, Tithingman, or Head-borough, duly authorized for that Purpose by Warrant under the Hand and Seal of any Justice or Justices of the Peace residing nearest to such Place or Places, to make and give Orders for the providing of Carriages for the Baggage of Soldiers on March, and to appoint Persons having Carriages within their respective Liberties or Jurisdictions to provide and furnish such Carriages, without having any special or particular Warrant for that Purpose; and all such Orders and Appointments shall be and be deemed to be as valid and effectual in all respects, and to all Intents and Purposes, as if the same had been made and given by the Justice or Justices of the Peace having such Authority: Provided always, that every such Justice of the Peace shall, at the Time of giving such Warrant and Authority, and thereafter once in each Year, or oftener if necessanr, cause a List or Lists to be made out, of all Persons liable to furnish such Carriages, under such Warrant, and of the Number and Description of Carriages belonging respectively to the Persons so liable to be required to furnish Carriages for Baggage, or for Troops on the March; and such Lists shall, at all seasonable Hours, be open to the Inspection of all Persons whose Names shall be inserted therein; and all Orders and Appointments for such Carriages shall be made and taken from such Lists in regular Rotation, as far as the same can be done, so as that the providing such Carriages shall be equally distributed among the several Persons liable to furnish the same under the Provisions of this Act.

LXXVL And Whereas, from various local Circumstances, the Rates of Carriage in Ireland cannot be regulated in the same

LXXVII. And Whereas it may sometimes become necessary

in Cases of Emergency to provide proper and speedy Means for the Carriage and Conveyance not only of the Arms, Clothes,

Accoutrements, Tents, Baggage, and other Equipage of and be-

longing to His Majesty's Forces in their Marches, but also to the Officers, Soldiers, Servants, Women, Children, and other Persons of and belonging to such Forces: And Whereas it is expedient that Provision should be made for enforcing prompt Obedience to such Orders as His Majesty or the Lord Lieutenant or other Chief Governor in Ireland may in such Cases think fit to issue in pursuance of the Powers by Law vested in him for the 1 Advancement of the general Good and public Welfare of the

37

Realm Be it therefore further enacted, That it shall be lawful for His Majesty, or such Lord Lieutenant or Chief Governor or Governors in Ireland, by his or their Order, distinctly stating that such Case of Emergency doth exist, signified by the Secretory at War, or, if in Ireland, by the Chief Secretary, or in his Absence by the Under Secretary for the Civil Department, or the First Clerk in the Military Department for the Time being, to any General or Field Officer commanding His Majesty's Forces in any District or Place, or to the Agent for the Supply of Stores and Provisions at Home, or Person acting in that Capacity, to authorize such General or Field Officers or Agent as aforesaid, or Person aforesaid, by Writing under his Hand, reciting such Order of His said Majesty, or Lord Lieutenant or Chief Governor aforesaid, to require all Justices of the Peace within their several Counties, Ridings, Divisions, Cities, Liberties, and Precincts in England, Ireland, Wales, and the Town of Berwick-upon- Txx>eed> to issue his or their Warrant or Warrants for any of the Purposes hereinafter mentioned; and such Justice or Justices shall, when and as often as such Requisition in Writing as last mentioned shall be brought and shewn unto any One or more of such Justices, by the Quartermaster, Adjutant, or other Officer of the Regiment, Detachment, Troop, or Company so ordered to be conveyed, or by any Officer in the Commissariat Department, to issue out his or their Warrant or Warrants to the Constable or Petty Constables of the County, Division, Riding, City, Liberty, Hundred, and Precinct from, through, near, or to which such Regiment, Detachment, Troop, or Company shall be so ordered to be conveyed, requiring them to make such Provision, not only of Waggons, Wains, Carts, and Cars, kept by or belonging to any Person or Persons, and for any Use or Purpose whatsoever, but also of Saddle Horses, Coaches, Chaises, and other Four-wheeled Carriages usually let to Hire, or kept for that Purpose; and also of Boats, Barges, and other Vessels used for the Carriage of Coals, Stone, Lime, Manure, or of Goods, Wares, or Merchandizes, or any other Articles or Commodity whatsoever, upon any Canal or navigable River, with able Men and Horses to drive, navigate, and draw the same, as shall be mentioned in the said Warrant or Warrants, therein specifying the Place or Distance to which such Horses, Carriages, Boats, Barges, or other Vessels, and Men, shall go and be conveyed, and allowing such Constables sufficient Time to make such Provisions, that the neighbouring Parts may not always bear the Burthen; and in case such sufficient Carnages, Horses, Boats, Barges, or other Vessels, and Men, cannot be provided within any such County, Riding, Division, Hundred, City, Liberty, or Precinct, then the next Justice or Justices of the Peace of the next County, Riding, Division, City, Liberty, or Precinct shall, upon such Requisition in Writing as last aforesaid being brought or shewn to any One or more of them, by any of the Officers aforesaid, issue his or their Warrant or Warrants to the Constables or Petty Constables of such next County, Riding, City, Liberty, Division, Hundred, or Precinct, for the Purposes last aforesaid, to make up such Deficiency; and the aforesaid Officer or Officers, who by virtue of the aforesaid Warrant or Warrants from the Justice or Justices of the Peace, are to demand

LXXXIV. And Whereas, in consequence of certain Exemp-

tions from Toll expressly allowed by several Acts for His Majesty's Forces on their March or on Duty, and for the Horses and Carriages attending them, Doubts have arisen whether in all Cases not so exempted, the Horses and Soldiers, and the

Carriages and Horses belonging to His Majesty, or employed in His Majesty's Service, and returning therefrom, may not be charged with the Payment of Tolls; Therefore, for obviating such Doubts, it is hereby enacted and declared, That all His Majesty's Officers and Soldiers, being in proper Staff or Regimental Uniform, and their Horses, on Duty or on their March, and all Carriages and Horses belonging to His Majesty, or employed

LXXXV. And Whereas the respective Sums of Money by (this Act appointed to be paid to the Constables by the Officers (demanding such Carriages, Horses, Boats, Barges, or Vessels, may not in many Cases be sufficient to answer the Charge and ' Expence of providing the same, insomuch that the said Con stables may frequently be at great Charges over and above what c is received by them of the said Officers, to the great Burthen (of the Townships of which they are Constables, or else the Persons providing such Carriages are grievously oppressed; ' For Remedy whereof, and that the said Overplus Charge may be borne by each County or Riding at the general Charge of such County or Riding, be it further enacted, That the Treasurer or Treasurers of such respective County or Riding shall, without Fee or Reward, pay unto such Constable all and every such reasonable Sum or Sums of Money so by him paid or laid out for such Carriages, Horses, Boats, Barges, and other Vessels, over and above what was or ought to have been paid by the Officer requiring such Carriages, Horses, Boats, Barges, and other Vessels, out of the public Stock of such County or Riding, according to such Rates, Orders, Rules, and Directions as the Justices of the Peace in their Quarter Sessions assembled, within their respective Jurisdictions, shall from time to time during the Continuance of this Act make, direct and appoint {which Orders shall be made without Fee or Reward); regard being always had to the Season of the Year and the Length and Condition of the Ways by and through which such Carriages, Horses, Boats, Barges, and other Vessels are to travel and pass.

XC. And be it further enacted, That where any Troop or Parties upon Command have occasion in their March to pass regular Ferries in that Part of Great Britain called Scotland, it shall and may be lawful for the Commanding Officer either to pass over with his Party as Passengers, or to hire the Ferry Boat entirely to himself and his Party, debarring others for that Time in-his Option; and in case he shall choose to take Passage for himself and Party as Passengers, he shall only pay, for himself and for each Person, Officer, or Soldier under his Command, Half of the ordinary Rate payable by single Persons at any such Ferry; and in case he shall hire the Ferry Boat for himself and Party, he shall pay Half of the ordinary Rate for such Boat or Boats; and in such Places where there are no regular Ferries, but that all Passengers hire Boats at the Rate they can agree for, Officers with or without Parties are to agree for Boats at the Rate as other Persons do in the like Cases.

from Tolls expressly allowed by several Acts for His Majesty's ' Forces on their March or on Duty, and for the Horses and Carriages attending them, Doubts have arisen whether in all (Cases not so exempted the Officers and Marines, and the Car-

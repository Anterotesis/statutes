XIX. And whereas there is Reason to believe that in some of the said Colonies no complete Division has been made of the apprenticed Labourers into distinct Classes, and that in the Divisions which have been made certain Apprentices have been erroneously registered as praedial apprenticed Labourers, and it is necessary that Provision should be made for the Completion of every incomplete Classification, and for the Correction of all erroneous Classificationsbe it enacted, That in each of the said Colonies in which at the Time of the Proclamation of this Act no complete Classification shall have been made, or no legal Provision shall be in force for revising the Classification of the Apprentices in such Colony, it shall be lawful for the Governor thereof, if he shall think fit, by Proclamation, by and with the Advice of the Council, to make Regulations for the complete Classification and effectual Revision of the Classification, as the Case may require, in such Colony, and for this Purpose to appoint fit and proper Persons having no Interest in any such Classification to complete such Classification and make such Revision, and that the Persons so appointed shall have full Power to correct all such Errors as shall be proved to them to exist in the said Classification, and that their Decision in each Case shall be final, except in the Case of Appeal as herein-after provided; provided that no Regulation so to be made as aforesaid for such Classification or Revision shall be repugnant to the said Act of Parliament, and that no Person who was of the Age of Twelve Years and upwards on the Twenty-eighth Day of August in the Year One thousand eight hundred and thirty-three shall be included or retained in either of the Classes of praedial apprenticed Labourers, unless such Person

XX. And whereas Doubts have arisen respecting the Validity of the Division of apprenticed Labourers into Three Classes in the Island of Jamaica *, by reason that the said Division was carried into effect under Rules and Regulations established by an Act of Assembly which has been disallowed by Her Majesty by the Advice of Her Privy Councilbe it therefore declared and enacted, That the said Classification in the Island of Jamaica shall, for the Purpose of such Revision, be taken to be valid and effectual, and shall be subject to such Revision as is herein-before directed.

4 which the Encroachments described as such in a certain Map (made in the Year One thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven,

in pursuance of the Report of certain Commissioners, should be laid down distinct from those of a more modern Date; and also stating that in the Maps so prepared under the Direction of the said Commissioners, whose Report is now in recital, (and which Maps are annexed to the said Report,) the old Encroachments were coloured Red, those which were taken in between the Years One thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven and One

thousand eight hundred and twelve Blue, and those inclosed since

the Year One thousand eight hundred and twelve Yellow; that ' every Facility, by repealed Notices given generally and indi-

vidually, had been afforded to the several Parties in Possession of Lands coloured Blue and Yellow to appeal against the ' Colour by which their Encroachments were distinguished, and 1 nearly all of them appeared before the said Commissioners in Person or by Proxy; that the few who did not so appear received further Notice of the Day appointed for final Adjudication; that all Red Encroachments were included in One Class,

4 because the said Commissioners could not presume that any of them were inclosed before the said Act of the Twentieth Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second; but the Crown having had its Attention called by the Proceedings of the Commissioners appointed ia One thousand seven hundred and eightyseven, as in the said Report is mentioned, to the Existence of these Red Encroachments, and not having taken any effectual Steps to assert its Right, ought not to disturb the Possession;

the said Commissioners by their said Report therefore recommended that the Lands coloured Red in the said Plans (amounting to One thousand five hundred and ten Acres Two Roods and Thirty-two Perches) should be declared to be Freehold of Inheritance, subject however to a Condition that no additional Dwelling Houses should be erected thereon without the Licence of the Crown, to be registered in the Court of Attachments; 'and that the Lands coloured Blue in the said Plans,

4 containing Five hundred and seventy-three Acres and Ten and 4 a Half Perches, should be granted to their present Possessors for Three Lives, not renewable except at the Pleasure of the Crown, and that the said Possessors should respectively pay Rents varying from One Shilling to Two Shillings per Acre;

4 and that the Possessors of the Lands coloured Yellow, containing Twenty-four Acres Two Roods Nine and a Half Perches,

4 should have Terms of Years varying from Fourteen to Twentyone Years, as in the Appendix to the said Report is set forth,

4 paying Rents varying from Four Shillings to Eight Shillings an Acre; and that the Condition as to building Dwelling Houses should apply to those Classes also; and the said Commissioners stated that the Extent of the Red, Blue, and Yellow Lands, 4 the Name of the Person in Possession, the Terms on which the same were held, and the Rents severally reserved, were respectively described in the Appendix to their said Report; and further that the Lands given in Exchange under the Authority of an Act passed in the Tenth Year of the Reign of King George the Fourth, therein mentioned and partly hereafter recited, were

and that the Advantage of ascertaining the Value of the Encroachments did not appear to the said Commissioners sufficient

to justify the great Expence of employing a Surveyor for that ' Purpose; and that as Application to Parliament was necessary

to carry into effect the said Provisions, the said Commissioners recommended that a Clause should be introduced ' enacting that any new Dwelling House thereafter erected 1 without Licence and due Registration on any of the En-

croachments in which Estates should have been created in pursuance of the Report now in recital should be deemed a Purpresture within the Meaning of the said Act passed in the Tenth

such Rent-charge as aforesaid in respect of the same Lands, then and in such Case an annual Sum equal to the Amount of such Rent-charge shall be from Time to Time payable to the Person so liable to the Payment of such Rent-charge by the next immediate Lessee holding under him, such Sum to become first due on the First Day of November in this present Year, and to be then payable by one entire Payment, and the like annual Sum thereafter in every succeeding Year, to be payable at such Times and by such quarterly or half-yearly or yearly Payments as the Rent due and payable by such Lessee may be reserved and made payable, and together therewith, and subject to all the like Incidents, in like Manner, to all Intents and Purposes, as if such Sum had been mentioned in the same Lease, Instrument, or Demise, and expressly reserved and made payable thereby; and the Person liable to such Rent-charge as aforesaid shall have such and the like Remedies to enforce Payment of such Sum by Distress, Ejectment, or Re-entry, or by Action of Debt, Covenant, or otherwise, as he may have to enforce Payment of the Rent reserved by such Lease, Instrument, for Demise; and the said next immediate Lessee, in case he himself would not have been liable to the Payment of such Tithe Compositions as aforesaid, shall be in like Manner and by all such and the like Remedies entitled to receive and recover of and from his immediate Sub-Lessee such annual Sum from Time to Time accruing due and payable, and so on, each Lessee recovering from his Sub-Lessee downwards to the Person who would have been primarily liable to the Payment of such Tithe Compositions if this Act had not been made: Provided always, that in the Case of the Land being divided among several Lessees or Sub-Lessees, each of them shall be liable to the Payment of no greater Portion of such annual Sum than may from Time to Time become due and payable in respect of the Land which such Lessee or Sub-Lessee, or any other Person with him jointly, may hold: Provided also, that where any Person would have been liable, under the Provisions of any Law now in force in Ireland, to make Payment of any Composition to any Landlord or Person entitled to the Receipt of the same by virtue of any Certificate of Agreement as is mentioned in the herein-before mentioned Act of the Second and Third Year of His late Majesty's Reign, such Person liable to make Payment of such Composition to the Person entitled thereto by virtue of such Certificate shall be deemed to be within the Meaning of this Act the Person primarily liable thereto; and where the Lessee or Occupier of any Lands may be entitled to deduct out of the Rent payable by him to his Landlord the Amount of any Composition, such Landlord shall be deemed to be within the Meaning of this Act the Person primarily liable thereto.

XI. And be it enacted, That in any Case where the Effect of any Composition may be by any Law now in force suspended in consequence of any Lease of Tithes, or Agreement in Writing respecting the same, every such Lease or Agreement having such Effect as aforesaid, but none other, shall from and after the passing of this Act wholly cease and determine, but without Prejudice to the Recovery of any Sum heretofore accrued due by virtue thereof; and the Lands which would, if this Act had not been made,

have upon the Termination of such Lease or Agreement become subject to the Payment of any Composition for Tithes, shall be and become severally charged with an annual Sum or Rent-charge equal to Three Fourths of the Amount of such Composition, and an annual Sum equal in Amount to such Rent-charge shall become payable to the Persons from Time to Time liable to the Payment of such Rent-charge, and to their Lessees and Sub-Lessees, in like Manner as herein-before provided in Cases where the Effect of such Compositions shall not have been suspended as aforesaid:

Provided nevertheless, that if any Payment on account of this present Year shall previous to the passing of this Act have accrued due by virtue of or under such Lease or Agreement, the Amount thereof shall be deducted from the Rent-charge accruing due on the First Day of November in this present Year, and the Residue only shall be then payable.

XII. And whereas by an Act passed in the Fourth Year of Where Leases the Reign of His Majesty King George the Fourth, intituled An ?l 4 Act to provide for the Establishment of Compositions for Tithes in Ireland for a limited Time, it was enacted, that whenever Uahment of any under the Provisions of that Act any Composition should be Composition in made for Tithes payable in any Parish, every Person who should pursuance of afterwards set, let, or demise any Land lying within such Parish 4* " *

4 at a Rack Rent should make such Lease or Demise free from ijf1

the Payment of Tithes during the Continuance of such Com- proportion to

4 position; and that in such Case it should be lawful for the the Difference Lessee or Occupier of such Land, and every such Lessee or between such Occupier was thereby required, to pay the Amount of such exposition Composition to the Person entitled thereto; and that it should charee^ayaWo 4 be lawful for such Lessee or Occupier of such Land to deduct ^aer this Act. 4 the Amount of all such Payments from Time to Time out of the Amount of Rent payable by such Lessee or Occupier of such Land to his immediate Landlord; and it was further enacted by the said recited Act, that in case such Composition should cease and determine at any Time during the Continuance of such Lease, the Rent reserved in such Lease should be reduced

4 in Amount by a Sum equal to the Amount of such Composition:

And whereas in such Cases of Land set, let, or demised at a 4 Rack Rent in any Parish at any Time after the Establishment of a Composition for Tithes therein the Amount of such Composition has by reason of the said recited Enactments been added to and made payable together with and as Part of the Rent, and it is just and reasonable that such Rent should be reduced to the Extent of the Reduction made under this Act in converting the said Composition into a Rent-charge; be it therefore enacted, That in case of any Lease made at a Rack Rent, at any Time after the Establishment of a Composition for Tithes in any Parish, of Lands subject to the Payment of such Composition, the Rent reserved upon and made payable in and by any such Lease shall be reduced by a Sum equal to the Difference between the Amount of the Composition heretofore payable in respect of such Lands and the Amount of the Rent-charge which will under the Provisions of this Act become payable in lieu thereof, and that the Party from Time to Time liable to the Payment of such Rent shall be entitled to deduct the Amount of

such Difference accordingly: Provided always, that, subject to such Reduction, such Rent shall remain payable, and the Lessor, his Heirs, Executors, Administrators, and Assigns, shall have the like Remedies for the Recovery thereof as if the said Tithe Compositions were not by this Act determined.

XIII. And whereas in Cases w here the said Compositions for ' Tithes have been established by a sole Commissioner appointed ' by the Lord Lieutenant, in pursuance of an Act passed in the

Second and Third Years of the Reign of His late Majesty King

William the Fourth, intituled An Act to amend Three Acts 1 passed respectively in the Fourth, Fifth, and in the Seventh and Eighth Years of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Fourth, providing for the establishing of Compositions for Tithes in Ireland, and to make such Compositions permanent, it is just

and expedient, with a view to a final and satisfactory Settlement ' of the Amount of the said Compositions for Tithes, and the

Rent-charges payable in lieu thereof, that Appeals should be allowed within a limited Time against the Certificates of such

Compositions where the Amount thereof may have been unduly affected by Fraud or Concealmentbe it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for any Person or Persons in any Parish who would have been, in case this Act had not been made, individually or collectively liable to the Payment of more than One Half of the Amount of the whole Composition established in and for such Parish, whether the several Sums payable by him or them respectively shall be or may have been payable to any Party entitled to the Receipt of any Composition, or to any Landlord who may have taken upon him the Payment of such Composition, at any Time before the First Day of October next to appeal to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in Council in behalf of such Parish against the Certificate of such Composition, in like Manner as by the said Act of the Second and Third Years of His said late Majesty King William the Fourth, and the Acts therein recited, an Appeal might have been made by Direction of the Vestry of the Parish within the Time thereby limited, and the Grounds of such Appeal shall be stated in Writing and signed by such Person or Persons, and lodged writh the Clerk of the Privy Council before the said First Day of Octolter, and in like Manner it shall be lawful for any Person who would have been, in case this Act had not been made, entitled to any Composition for Tithes, before the said First Day of October, to appeal to the said Lord Lieutenant in Council against such Certificate in like Manner as by the said last-mentioned Acts such Appeals might have been made within the Time thereby limited; and Notice of every such Appeal shall be posted on the Church Door or usual Place of posting Notices of Application of Grand Jury Presentments in the Barony or Half Barony in which the Parish to which such Application may refer is situate, and once inserted by or on behalf of the Appellant Party in some Newspaper circulating within such Parish within Ten Days next after such Appeal shall have been lodged with the Clerk of the Privy Council: Provided always, that where the Effect of any Composition may have been suspended previous to the passing of this Act by virtue of any Lease or Agreement in Writing, the Owners and Occupiers of

any Lands upon which collectively a Sum exceeding One Half of the Amount of such Composition may have been applotted shall be deemed and taken to be qualified within the Meaning of this Act to make such Appeal.

XIV. And be it enacted, That every such Appeal shall be heard and determined, and an Order made thereupon lor confirming or for decreasing or increasing or modifying the Amount of such Composition, in like Manner as is provided by the said last-mentioned Act with respect to Appeals thereby authorized to be made against such Certificates; and all the Enactments and Provisions contained in the same Act relating to the Appeals thereby authorized to be made against such Certificates, and the Costs thereof, shall extend and be applied to Appeals authorized by this Act, and the Costs thereof, except so far as the same are repugnant to the Provisions of this Act: Provided always, that no Order shall be made on any such Appeal, otherwise than for confirming the Composition stated in the Certificate, unless it shall be proved that some Fraud, Concealment, Misrepresentation, or Circumvention was practised by or on the Part of some Party interested in such Composition, whereby the Commissioner may have been deceived, or whereby the Knowledge of any Fact or Facts which was or were essential to enable the Commissioner to make a just Decision was withheld from him, and whereby the Amount of such Composition was unduly affected: Provided also, that when an Appeal from any Certificate of Composition has before the passing of this Act been decided upon the Merits by the Lord Lieutenant in Council, or by any Judge of Assize, no further Appeal relating thereto shall be made by virtue of this Act

XV. And be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for any Person or Persons in any Parish who would have been, in case this Act had not been made, individually or collectively liable to the Payment of more than One Fourth of the Amount of the whole Composition established in and for such Parish, whether the several Sums payable by him or them respectively shall be or may have been payable to any Party entitled to the Receipt of any Composition, or to any Landlord who may have taken upon him the Payment of such Composition, to apply to the said Lord Lieutenant in Council, praying the Amendment of the Applotment of any Composition, and such Application shall be made by Memorial, to be lodged at any Time before the First Day of October next with the said Clerk of the Council, and notified by public Advertisement and otherwise, in like Manner as Appeals against Certificates of Compositions; and if by any such Memorial it shall be made to appear to the Satisfaction of the said Lord Lieutenant in Council that any such Applotment of such Composition is defective or unjust, or does not with sufficient Precision ascertain the Lands and Holdings in respect whereof the said Rent-charges will be payable, it shall and may be lawful for the said Lord Lieutenant in Council to direct such Applotment to be amended, and for that Purpose to appoint some One or more skilful Person or Persons, who shall therein have and exercise the like Powers, Privileges, and Authorities, and observe the several Regulations in the said Acts for establishing Compositions of Tithes expressed and contained, but subject nevertheless to such

XVI. And forasmuch as the Rent-charges made payable by this Act are charged upon the Lands heretofore subject to the Payment of Compositions for Tithes, it is expedient to make Provisions for the more cheap and convenient Determination of the Liability to such Compositions; be it therefore enacted, That where any Person having any Interest in any Lands whereon any such Composition shall have been applotted shall dispute the Liability of such Lands thereto, by reason of such Land having been Tithe-free, or not rightfully charged with or otherwise not subject to such Tithe Compositions or the Applotment thereof, it shall be

Provided that in any such Proceeding the Certificate or Applotment of any such Composition shall not be Evidence of the Liability of such Lands to such Composition, or the Applotment thereof.

XVII. And be it enacted, That where any Lands made subject When Tithe-to the Payment of any Part of a Composition (the Amount of Lands have such Composition not having been fixed by Agreement) shall, by bera subjected virtue of any Decision in Law or Equity, have been or at any Time such Compo^"1 shall be declared to be exempt from the Payment of Tithes, it ation shall be shall be lawful for the Court of Chancery or Exchequer in Ireland, reduced, upon the Petition of any Person liable to the Payment of Rent-

An Act for the Abolition of the Duties payable on the Coinage of Tin in the Counties of Cornwall and Devon, and for giving Compensation in lieu of such Duties, and to reduce the Duties of Customs payable on Tin.

[16th August 1838.]

WHEREAS, by the Laws, Usages, and Customs of the

4 " Counties of Cornwall and Devon, all Tin dug, raised, and

taken therein respectively is required to be coined, and certain Duties are payable for the Coinage thereof: And whereas by Charter made and passed in the Eleventh Year of the Reign of His Majesty King Edward the Third, and duly confirmed by Parliament, the said Coinage Duties, together with certain other Possessions, were thereby granted to the then Duke of Cornwall, and to the first-begotten Son of him and his Heirs (Kings of England) , being Dukes of Cornwall and Heirs Apparent to the Kingdom of England, and the same were thereby annexed and united to the Duchy of Cornwall for ever, to remain so that from the said Duchy they should at no Time be in anywise severed, so that when the Duke of Cornwall for the Time being should depart this Life, and a Son to whom the said Duchy was thereby appointed should not appear, the said Duchy should revert to and be retained in the Hands of the King of England for the Time being, until such Son, being Heir Apparent, should appear: And whereas such Duties on the Coinage of Tin in the said Counties of Cornwall and Devon are now payable to Her Majesty in right of Her Duchy of Cornwall: And whereas it is expedient and for the Benefit of Trade that it should not be necessary that any Tin 4 so dug, raised, or taken should hereafter be coined, and that all Duties so as aforesaid payable on the Coinage thereof should cease, and that Compensation in lieu thereof should be given to Her Majesty or other the Personage for the Time being entitled to the Revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall: Be it therefore enacted by the Queens most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the Tenth Day of October next ensuing the passing of this Act it shall not be necessary to coin any Tin dug, raised, or taken in the said Counties of Cornwall and Devon, or in either of them, and that the Duties which would but for this Act be payable on the Coinage of Tin after that Time shall cease and determine.

II. And be it enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury and they are hereby required to ascertain the Amount of the clear annual Payments during the last Ten Years in respect of such Coinage Duties in the said Counties of Devon and Cornwall, after deducting therefrom all Costs, Charges, and Expences to Officers and others during such Period incurred in and incident to the ascertaining, managing, and collecting of such Coinage Duties.

III. And be it enacted, That in lieu of such Coinage Duties an Annuity or yearly Sum equal to the Amount which shall be so ascertained to have been the Average of such Payments shall be

IV. And be it enacted, That the Acquittances or Acquittance, Receipts or Receipt, of the Receiver General for the Time being of the said Duchy of Cornwall, shall be a good and sufficient Discharge for the Payment of the said Annuity.

V. And be it enacted, and it is hereby declared to be the true Intent and Meaning hereof, That Her Majesty and other the Personage for the Time being entitled to the Revenues of the said Duchy of Cornwall shall have such and the like, and no larger or other, Estate or Title or Power of Disposition or Alienation, or Interest, of and in the said Annuity, as Her Majesty or other the Personage for the Time being entitled to the Revenues of the said Duchy of Cornwall would have had in the said Coinage Duties, and that the said Annuity shall from Time to Time belong to Her Majesty and such other Personage as would have been entitled to the said Coinage Duties in case this Act had not been passed.

VI. And whereas it is only just and reasonable that Provision should be made for granting Compensation upon equitable Prin-

ciples to such Officers and others as have heretofore been employed ' in the ascertaining, managing, and collecting such Coinage Duties,

and in relation thereto, and whose Emoluments will be affected

hereby; be it enacted, That the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury shall ascertain, by such Ways and Means as to them shall seem proper, the net annual Receipts of each and every of such Officers and others whose Emoluments shall J>e affected by the Operation of this Act, and shall grant such Compensation to all such Parties, either by One Payment in gross, or by an annual Amount payable quarterly, as, having regard to the Tenure of their several Offices and Employments, and to the Duration of their Service, shall appear to the said Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to be just and proper: Provided.always, that all such Compensations shall be payable and paid out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

VII. And be it enacted, That a Return of the Amount of the Compensation ascertained to be due and payable on account of the Repeal of the said Coinage Duties on Tin, together with a Statement of all such Compensations as shall be granted to the Officers and others whose Emoluments shall be affected by the Operation of this Act, and also a Return of the gross annual Payments during each of the said Ten Years in respect of such Coinage Duties, and also a Return of all the Costs, Charges, and Expences to Officers

C A R XVIII.

An Act to make further Provision for the Payment of the Crews of His Majesty's Ships and Vessels.

[2d May 1825.]

WHEREAS by an Act made and passed in the Thirty first W Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the

Second, intituled An Act for the Encouragement of Seamen em-

ployed in the Royal Navy, and for establishing a regular Method ' for the punctual, frequent and certain Payment of their Wages;

' and for enabling them more easily and readily to remit the same c for the Support of their Wives arid Families; and for preventing 6 Frauds and Abuses attending such Payments; it is, amongst other Provisions for the due Payment of the Navy, enacted, that whensoever and as soon as any Ship or Vessel of I-Iis Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, having been Twelve whole Months or more in Sea Pay, shall be or arrive in any Port of Great Britain where any Commissioner of the Navy shall be or reside, the Commissioners of the Navy at their Board shall solicit such Sums of Money as shall be sufficient, and as soon as the same shall be issued, shall cause immediate Payment to be made of k all the Wages due upon the Pay Books (therein before directed to be transmitted to the said Commissioners) to all such Officers and Seamen, their Executors and Administrators, or to their respective Attorney or Attornies duly authorized as thereinafter directed, deducting thereout whatever Monies shall have been paid before by way of Advance, or that shall stand against

them in the Books of such Ships or Vessels on account of any Defalcation, leaving always Six Months' Wages and no more due to such Officers and Seamen for their Service in such Ship or Vessel unpaid and in arrear: And Whereas it has since been found convenient and expedient that His Majesty's Ships and Vessels shall be occasionally paid at Ports and Places where a Commissioner of the Navy shall not be or reside, and it is necessary that a proper and discretionary Authority should be given to the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of this United Kingdom, to order Payments to be made at any such Ports or Places when found expedient for the Public Service Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act, it shall and may be lawful for the said Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, as often as they may think convenient and expedient that any of His Majesty's Ships or Vessels shall be paid at a Port where a Commissioner of the Navy shall

not

A.D. 1825. 6° GEO. IV. C. 18.

91

not be or reside, to signify their Directions in Writing for that Purpose to the principal Officers and Commissioners of the Navy, who shall thereupon take the proper Steps for causing Payments to be made accordingly by the Clerks of the Treasurer of the Navy, in the usual Manner, in the Presence of a Commissioner of the Navy to be sent thither for that Purpose, or other Officer to be appointed as hereinafter mentioned, and of the proper Clerks of the Navy Office.

II. And Whereas it may be expedient to pay the Crews of Ships on their Arrival at the Port, or previous to sailing from 6 thence, under Circumstances which will not admit of the Delay which must necessarily occur in sending the Pay Books of such Ship or Vessel to the Navy Office to be examined previously to 6 Payment being made thereupon, as is required by the said recited Act; ' Be it therefore further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy, in Cases of Urgency, as they shall see necessary, to cause Payment to be made upon such Books without the previous Examination thereof as aforesaid; but it is nevertheless hereby required and directed that the said Books shall, immediately after Payment shall have been so made thereon, be transmitted to the Navy Office, for the Purpose of undergoing the necessary Examination and Adjustment, and in order that any Charges omitted to be made, or any Overpayments that may have occurred thereon, may be set off, or abated and recovered, at the first Opportunity, from the Arrears of Wages or growing Wages of the Men in respect of whom such Omissions or Overpayments may have taken place.

III. And Whereas-it may be occasionally inconvenient and inexpedient to the public Service, at Ports where a single Commissioner may be or reside, and incompatible with his other publie Duties, that he should superintend and controul Payments of Ships and Vessels; and it may be proper that a discretionary Authority should be vested in the said Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, to substitute an Officer to superintend and controul the said Payments instead of a Commissioner of the NavyBe it therefore further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, when and so often as they may deem it expedient, to appoint an Officer of the Navy, of the Rank of Captain or Commander, to superintend and controul the Payment of any of His Majesty's Ships and Vessels; and that all Payments to be made in the Presence of and under the Superintendance and Controul of such Officer, shall be held as Payments made in the Presence of a Commissioner of the Navy, and be passed to the Credit of the Treasurer of the Navy accordingly.

IV. And Whereas it has been considered beneficial to His Majesty's Service, that a certain Portion of the Pay which may be due to the Warrant and Petty Officers, not allowed to draw Bills for their Pay, and to each Seaman, Non-commissioned Officer and Private of Marines and Boy serving on board His Majesty's Ships and Vessels, who may be desirous of receiving it, shall be issued to them at the Expiration of every Month, or as soon after as the Convenience and Necessity of the Service may admit, on the

4 Ship's Arrival at any Port at Home or Abroad where Money ' can be procured for that Purpose, which Regulation cannot be c carried into Effect without an Alteration of certain Provisions ' for the better Payment of the Navy, which have been establish-£ ed by the said Act before recited; ' Be it therefore further enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, it shall and may be lawful for the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, to authorize and direct the Issuing and Paymentjto such of the Warrant and Petty Officers of His Majesty's Ships and Vessels in Commission as are not entitled to draw Bills, and to the Seamen, Non-commissioned Officers and Privates of Marines and Boys, who shall be desirous of receiving the same, a Portion of the Pay which may be actually due to them, in such Proportions per Month, to such Amount and according to such Rate, as shall for that Purpose be authorized and ordered by His Majesty in Council; such Payment to be made in any Port Abroad or at Home, at the Expiration of every Month, or as soon after as the Convenience and Necessity of the Service will admit; and for the Purpose of carrying this Regulation into Effect, the Captain or Commanding Officer is hereby directed and enjoined to make out or cause to be made out a complete List of the Names with their respective Numbers on the Ship's Books, of such of the Description of Persons before mentioned as shall be willing to receive such Portion of their Pay, and who shall be actually on board at the Time of making out the said List, which List shall be signed by the said Captain or Commanding Officer, One other Commissioned Officer or Warrant Officer entitled to draw Bills, and by the Purser; and that the Purser of the said Ship or Vessel shall then draw, for the Amount of the said Portion of Pay so to be issued, a Bill at Three Days' Sight upon the Commissioners of the Navy, according to the Form set forth in the Schedule to this Act annexed, which Bill shall be certified by the Signature of the Captain or Commanding Officer of the Ship or Vessel in the Manner prescribed by th-e said Schedule; and the Commissioners of the Navy are hereby directed and enjoined to accept the said Bill, and assign it for Payment in the usual Manner on the Treasurer of the Navy, who shall be entitled to take Credit for the same, and the Amount shall be charged against the said Purser, who shall clear his Account in the Manner hereinafter directed; and that as soon as Cash shall have been obtained on the said Bill, the said Portion of Pay shall be paid by the said Purser to the Parties entitled thereto on the said List, in the Presence of the Captain or Commanding Officer and a Commissioned or Warrant Officer entitled to draw Bills, and the Payment shall be certified on the said List by the said Captain or Commanding Officer, the said Commissioned or Warrant Officer and the said Purser; and that as soon after the said Payment as may be, the said Captain or Commanding Officer shall transmit the said List by the first safe and convenient Opportunity to the Commissioners or the Navy; and the Captain or Commanding Officer and the Purser shall likewise, under their respective Hands, certify at the End of each Muster Book the full Amount, in Words at Length, of the Monies which shall have been so paid during the exact Period of Time of such Book, and that the several Sums so paid have

been

A.D. 1825. 6° GEO. IV. C.18-

been duly charged against the respective Men's Names on such Books: Provided always, that in case after any such Payment there shall be a Balance remaining in the Hands of the Purser, he shall give Credit for the Amount thereof in the next Bill to be drawn by him for Monthly Payments, so that he shall not be at liberty to draw for more than what, including such Balance, shall be sufficient to answer the next Monthly Payment.

V. And be it further enacted, That on the Receipt of the said List, the Payments made thereon shall be carried to the Credit of the Purser of the Ship or Vessel by whom the Bill for the Amount shall have been drawn as aforesaid; and on the making out of the Pay Books, Muster Books, Slop Books, Pay Lists and Pay Tickets of the said Ship or Vessel, the Sums so paid shall be charged against the Wages of each Person having received the same.

< VI. And Whereas it may happen that some of the Persons de-c sirous of receiving such Portion of Pay at the Time of such Payment be absent on Duty or sick, or on Leave of Absence, or ' from other sufficient Cause; ' Be it therefore further enacted, That on the Return to the Ship of any Individual so absent, his Name may and shall be subjoined to the next Lists to be made out for Payment, such Lists specifying the Cause and Date of Absence, and Date of Return; and in case any Individual shall be discharged to another Ship or Vessel, and shall at the Time of his Discharge be entitled to any Payment or Portion of Payment not then made, he shall be entitled to a Certificate from the Captain or Commanding Officer of the Ship or Vessel from which he may have been discharged, who is hereby required to furnish the same, specifying the Rating of such Individual in the Muster Books of the said Ship or Vessel, and the Time for which he is entitled to such Portion of Pay, which Portion shall be paid to him on the next Payment to be made to the Crew of the Ship or Vessel into which he may have been discharged, and shall be allowed to the Purser of such last mentioned Ship or Vessel in the Account of such next Payments: Provided nevertheless, that in all Cases where any of His Majesty's Ships and Vessels shall be at a Port where a Commissioner of the Navy shall be and reside, and whereat there shall be an Establishment of Clerks, having Money in their Custody for the Payment of Wages, and that such Monthly Portion of Pay hereinbefore authorized and directed to be advanced shall at that Time be due and payable, the Purser shall draw a Bill for the Amount thereof, subject to such Abatement, and certified and attested in Manner and Form as hereinbefore directed, which Bill shall be cashed to him by the Clerks to the Treasurer of the Navy at such Out Port out of the Monies in their Plands for the Payment of Wages, and the Amount thereof shall be charged by the Commissioners of the Navy against the Purser, as before directed, and the Treasurer of the Navy shall be entitled to take Credit for the same.

VII. And be it further enacted, That in case of a Payment made on board a Ship or Vessel which, from her Establishment or other Circumstances, may not have a Purser on board, the Commanding Officer of every such Ship or Vessel shall act as and be deemed to be the Purser for all the Purposes of this Act; and that in such Case the Payment shall be made in the Presence of

current in Great Britain Be it enacted, That from and after such Day as shall be named and appointed in and by any Proclamation, which shall be made and issued for that Purpose, by His Majesty, by and with the Advice of His Majesty's Privy Council in Great Britain, and by the Lord Lieutenant or other Chief Governor or Governors of Ireland, by and with the Advice of His Majesty's Privy Council in Ireland, it shall be lawful for any Person or Persons naving or possessing any Copper Coin or Money of the Currency of Ireland, and passing after the Rate of Thirteen Pence or Twenty Six Halfpennies for the Shilling British Currency, to bring any such Copper Coin, and to deliver the same at the Bank of Ireland, during such Period and within such Time as shall be mentioned and specified in such Proclamations; and that there shall be delivered at the said Bank of Ireland, to every Person bringing in and delivering such Copper Coin of the Currency of Ireland, a Sum in the current Copper Coin of Great Britain, after the Rate of Twelve Pence of such British Copper Coin for every Thirteen Pence or Twenty six Halfpence of such Copper Coin of the Currency of Ireland, so to be brought and delivered at the said Bank of Ireland; and that from and after a Day to be mentioned in such Proclamations as aforesaid, all Copper Coin of the Currency of Ireland shall cease to be current in Ireland, or in any Part of the United Kingdom, any Law, Statute, Usage or Custom to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

XIII. And Whereas Sums under the Amount of Twelve Pence of the Currency of Ireland cannot in certain Cases be paid by any equivalent Number of Pence, Halfpence, and Far-

things of the Currency of Great Britain, and it is unavoidable ' that in the Payment of several of such Sums an inconsiderable Loss of a Part of a Farthing must be incurred either by the Debtor or Creditor; and it is necessary that some plain Rule not liable to be misunderstood should be applied to ascertain upon which Party such inconsiderable Loss should fall Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the Commencement of this Act, the Sums of One Farthing, One Halfpenny, Three Farthings, One Penny, One Penny Farthing and One Penny Halfpenny of Irish Currency, shall be paid and satisfied by the Payment of One Farthing, One Halfpenny, Three Farthings, One Penny, One Penny Farthing, and One Penny Halfpenny respectively, in the Copper Currency of Great Britain; and that all Sums of Irish Currency exceeding One Penny Halfpenny, and not exceeding Four Pence Three Farthings, shall be and shall be deemed to be acquitted, paid and satisfied by the Payment of a Sum of the Copper Coinage of Great Britain, less by One Farthing than the expressed Amount of the Sum so payable in Irish Currency; and that all Sums of Irish Currency exceeding Four Pence Three Farthings, and not exceeding Eight Pence, shall be and shall be deemed to be acquitted, paid and

4 but not afterwards, to re-issue any such Promissory Notes or Note without being liable to pay a further Duty in respect thereof: And Whereas it is expedient that from and after the Commencement of this Act all such re-issuable Notes for the Payment of any Amount of Money in Irish Currency should cease to be re-issued, and that such Bankers should be relieved from the Loss arising from the ceasing to re-issue such Notes before the Expiration of the said Term of Three Years Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the Commencement of this Act, all Promissory Notes for the Payment to the Bearer on Demand of any Sum of Money not exceeding One hundred Pounds each, which shall be made and issued in Ireland by any registered Banker or other Person, and re-issuable under the Provisions of the said recited Act, shall be made payable according to the Amount thereof in British Currency, and not in Irish Currency; and that it shall not be lawful for any such registered Banker, or other Person in Ireland, at any Time after the Commencement of this Act, to re-issue any Promissory Note or Notes payable in Irish Currency, which shall have been issued in Ireland at any Time before the Commencement of this Act, and which shall be paid by such Banker or other Person at any Time after the Commencement of this Act; any Thing in the said recited Act to the contrary notwithstanding; and if any such Banker or other Person shall, at any Time after the Commencement of this Act, re-issue any such Note or Notes, such Banker or Bankers shall for every such Offence forfeit the Sum of Fifty Pounds, to be recovered in like Manner as any Penalty of the like Amount incurred under any Act or Acts relating to the Stamp Duties in Ireland.

LXVIII. And Whereas it frequently happens that Officers of the Customs and Excise, who from their Stations on the Coast,

' and other Circumstances, are instrumental in causing the Seizure 1 of Spirits and other Goods, but who, from their not being actually ' present at and assisting in the making such Seizure, have hitherto

not been considered as entitled to participate in the Officers '

1 Share of the same: And Whereas it is expedient in order to ' provide for such Cases, that the Commissioners of His Majesty's (Customs and Excise respectively should be authorized to direct ' Distribution of the Shares of all Seizures made by Officers or ' Persons acting under their Authority or Direction, or of any Penalties recovered or Rewards paid for the Apprehension of Smugglers, in such Manner as may appear to them to be most condu-

cive to the Protection of the Revenue; ' Be it therefore enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs or Excise respectively, and they are hereby authorized, in case of any Seizure of Vessels, Boats or Goods, or the Apprehension of any Parties under this or any other Act relating to the Revenue of Customs, to direct the Distribution of the Seizor's Share of such Vessels, Boats or Goods, or of any Penalties or Rewards, so as to enable any Officer or Officers, or other Person or Persons acting under the Authority of the said Commissioners respectively, or through whose Information or Means such Seizure shall have been made, or Penalty recovered, or Party apprehended, who shall not have been actually present at the making of the same, to participate in such Proportions as the said Commissioners shall respectively deem expedient.

LXIX. And be it further enacted, That upon Proof being made to the Satisfaction of the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs or Excise, that any Officer or Officers, or Person or Persons as aforesaid, shall have acted collusively or negligently in the making of any Seizure, it shall be lawful for the said Commissioners to

4 LXX. And Whereas it hath frequently happened that Spirits have been imported and brought into the Ports of this Kingdom in small Casks, and that the Persons importing and bringing the same have alleged that the same had been found floating upon or sunk in the Sea; and there is Reason to believe that great Frauds have been practised with regard to such Spirits, by the Persons so importing and bringing in the same, and so alleging as aforesaid; and it is therefore expedient, in order to prevent the like Frauds in future, that Persons not lawfully authorized to make Seizure of such Spirits should be restrained from intermeddling with or taking up any such Spirits, being in Casks of less Content than Forty Gallons, which may be found floating upon or sunk in the Sea; ' Be it therefore enacted, That no Person or Persons whatsoever, being a Subject or Subjects of His Majesty, His Fleirs and Successors, other than an Officer or Officers of the Navy, Customs or Excise, or some Person or Persons authorized in that Behalf, shall intermeddle with or take up any Spirits, being in Casks of less Content than Forty Gallons, which may be found floating upon or sunk in the Sea; and that if any Spirits shall be taken up, and shall be found or discovered on board any Vessel or Boat belonging as aforesaid, within the Limits of any Port of the United Kingdom or Isle of Man, or within the Distances in this Act before mentioned, the Vessel or Boat on which the same shall be found or discovered, together with such Spirits, shall be forfeited, and the Person or Persons in whose Custody or Possession the same shall be found shall forfeit he Penalty of Treble the Value of such Spirits, or the Sum of Fifty Pounds, at the Election of the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs.

LXXI. Provided always, and be it further enacted, That if any Person or Persons shall discover any Spirits, being in Casks of less Content than Forty Gallons, which may be found floating upon or sunk in the Sea, and shall give Information to any Officer of the Customs, or other Person or Persons duly authorized to make Seizure of such Spirits, so that Seizure shall be made of the same, the Person or Persons giving such Information shall be entitled to and shall receive such Reward as the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs may deem it expedient to direct.

LXXII. And be it further enacted, That for the necessary Subsistence of any poor Person confined in the United Kingdom, or in the Isle of Man, under or by virtue of any Exchequer or other Process for the Recovery of any Duties or Penalties, either upon Bond or otherwise, under this or any other Act relating to the Revenue of Customs or Excise, sued for under or by virtue of any Order of the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs or Excise, it shall and may be lawful to and for the Commissioners of Customs or Excise to cause an Allowance, not exceeding the Sum of Seven Pence Halfpenn} ^, and not less than Four Pence Halfpenny per Day, to be made to any such poor Person, out of any Money in their Hands arising from the Duties of Customs or Excise, as the Case may require.

CAP. CXIX.

An Act for the warehousing of Goods.

[5th July 1825.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the present Session of Parliament, intituled An Act to repeal the several Lavos relating to the Customs, in which it is declared, that the Laws ' of the Customs have become intricate by reason of the great c Number of Acts relating thereto which have been passed ' through a long Series of Years, and that it is therefore highly expedient for the Interests of Commerce and the Ends of Justice, and also for affording Convenience and Facility to all ' Persons who may be subject to the Operation of those Laws, or who may be authorized to act in the Execution thereof, that all the Statutes now in force relating to the Customs should be c repealed, and that the Purposes for which they have from time ' to time been made should be secured by new Enactments, exhibiting more perspicuously and compendiously the various Provisions contained in them: And Whereas by the said Act all the Laws relating to the warehousing of Goods will be repealed,

and it is expedient to make Regulations for the lodging and c securing in Warehouses or other Places of such Goods as may be imported into the United Kingdom to be so lodged and secured after such Repeal shall have Effect; ' Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the Fifth Day of January One thousand eight hundred and twenty six, this Act shall come into and be and continue in full Force and Operation for the warehousing of Goods imported into the United Kingdom, without Payment of Duty upon the First Entry thereof, or notwithstanding that such Goods may be prohibited to be imported into the United Kingdom to be used therein.

II. And be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, by their Warrant from time to time to appoint the Ports in the United Kingdom which shall be warehousing Ports for the Purposes of this Act; and that it shall be lawful for the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs, subject to the Authority and Directions of the Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, by their Order from time to time to appoint in what Warehouses or Places of special Security or of ordinary Security, as the Case may require, in such Ports, and in what different Parts or Divisions of such Warehouses or Places, and in what Manner any Goods and what Sorts of Goods, may and may only be warehoused and kept and secured without Pajmient of any Duty upon the First Entry thereof, or for Exportation only, in Cases wherein the same may be prohibited to be imported for Home Use; and also in such Order to direct in what Cases (if any) Security by Bond, in Manner hereinafter provided, shall be required in respect of any Warehouse so appointed by them. *%

III. And be it further enacted, That whenever any Warehouse shall have been approved of by the said Commissioners, as being

a Ware-

A.D. 1825. 6° GEO. IV. C. 112.

889

a Warehouse of special Security, it shall be stated, in their Order of Appointment, that such Warehouse is appointed as a Warehouse of special Security: Provided always, that all Warehouses connected with Wharfs for the landing of the Goods to be lodged therein, and enclosed together with such Wharfs within Walls, such as are or shall be required by any Act for the constructing of such Warehouses and Wharfs, and being appointed to be legal Quays, shall without any Order of the Commissioners of the Customs be Warehouses for the Purposes of this Act, for all Goods landed at such Wharfs or Quays at any Port appointed by the Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury to be a warehousing Port as aforesaid, and all such Warehouses shall be Warehouses of special Security.

IV. And be it further enacted, That all Appointments of Warehouses for the warehousing of Goods made under the Authority of any other Act in force at the Time of the Commencement of this Act, shall continue in force, as if the same had been made under the Authority of this Act, and all Bonds given in respect of any Goods warehoused or entered to be warehoused under any Act in force at the Time of the Commencement of this Act, shall continue in force for the Purposes of this Act.

V. And be it further enacted, That the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs shall, out of the Monies arising from the Duties of Customs, provide from time to time the Warehouses for the warehousing of Tobacco at the Ports into which Tobacco may be legally imported: Provided always, that for every Hogshead, Chest or Case of Tobacco so warehoused, the Importer or Proprietor thereof shall pay as and for Warehouse Rent such Sum or Sums not exceeding any Sum payable under any Act in force at the Time of the Commencement of this Act, and at such Periods and in such Manner as the Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury shall from time to time by their Warrant appoint and direct, and all such Sums shall be paid, received and appropriated as Duties of Customs.

VI. And be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful for the said Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury by their Warrant, and for the said Commissioners of the Customs by their Order, from time to time to revoke any former Warrant or any former Order, or to make any Alteration in or Addition to any former Warrant or any former Order, made by them as aforesaid respectively.

VII. And be it further enacted, That every Order made by the said Commissioners of the Customs in re$pect of Warehouses of special Security, as well those of original Appointment, as those of Revocation, Alteration or Addition, shall be published in the London Gazette, for such as shall be appointed in Great Britain, and in the Dublin Gazette, for such as shall be appointed in Ireland.

VIII. And be it further enacted, That before any Goods shall be entered to be warehoused in any Warehouse, in respect of which Security by Bond shall be required as aforesaid, the Proprietor or Occupier of such Warehouse, if he be willing, shall give general Security by Bond, with Two sufficient Sureties, for the Payment of the full Duties of Importation on all such Goods

IX. And be it further enacted, That if any Goods lodged in any Warehouse shall be the Property of the Occupier of such Warehouse, and shall be bona fide sold by him, and upon such Sale there shall have been a written Agreement signed by the Parties, or a written Contract of Sale made, executed and delivered by a Broker or other Person legally authorized for or on behalf of the Parties respectively, and the Amount of the Price stipulated in the said Agreement or Contract shall have been actually paid or secured to be paid by the Purchaser, every such Sale shall be valid, although such Goods shall remain in such Warehouse, provided that a Transfer of such Goods, according to such Sale, shall have been entered in a Book, to be kept for that Purpose by the Officer of the Customs having the Charge of such Warehouse, who is hereby required to keep such Book, and to enter such Transfers with the Dates thereof, upon Application of the Owners of the Goods, and to produce such Book upon Demand made.

X.

4 Five Pounds is imposed on Persons who shall commit certain §§ 3. 5. 20.

4 Offences in the said Act specified: And Whereas there are not in the said recited Act specified any Means whereby the said Penalty of Five Pounds thereby imposed can be recovered; Be it therefore enacted, That all Penalties of the Amount of Five Mode of re-Pounds, which are imposed by the said recited Act, shall be covering Penal-recoverable in the Name of the Master, Wardens and Society ties of 51 of the Art and Mystery of Apothecaries of the City of London in any of His Majesty's Courts of Record, in England or Wales, in the same Manner, and subject to the same Rules and Regulations in all Respects, as are in and by the said recited Act declared and provided with regard to the Recovery of the Penalty of Twenty Pounds thereby imposed on certain other Offences in the said recited Act mentioned.

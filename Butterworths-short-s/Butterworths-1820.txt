' Irish Channel, but to all the Shipping Interests trading or passing through Saint George's Channel and the Irish Sea9 to erect 4 a Second Pier to the West of the said Pier which has been so commenced: and the Erection of the said Second Pier not having been in the Contemplation of the Merchants and Traders of the City of Dublin, sufficient Means or Funds were not provided under the said recited Act for the Erection thereof: And Whereas by an Act passed in the Fifty second Year of the Reign 52 G. 3. c.

4 there will be a considerable Surplus of Duties over and above

what may be necessary for the lighting and keeping in repair the several Light Houses, Light Ships, Floating Lights, Beacons andl

Sea Marks, and it will be of the greatest Advantage and Means of Safety to all Merchantmen trading through Saint George's Channel and the Irish Sea, as well as to His Majesty's Ships and Cruisers, to complete the said Second Pier as speedily as possible, which cannot be done unless such Surplus Duties or a

Part thereof shall be appropriated towards the Erection of the

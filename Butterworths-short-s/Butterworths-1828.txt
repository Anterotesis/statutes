at some previous Hour of the same Day have been presented

for Payment as aforesaid: And Whereas it is expedient that ' such Doubts should be removed, and that the said inconvenient Practice occasioned thereby should be discontinuedBe it therefore enacted, That from and after the First Day of September One thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, in any Case where any Notary Public in Ireland shall present any Bill of Exchange, whether Foreign or Inland, or Promissory Note, for Payment thereof as aforesaid, and Payment of the same shall not be made at or before the Hour of Nine of the Clock in the Afternoon of the Day of such Presentment, it shall not be necessary for such Notary Public, or any Person for him at his House or Office, .to be in attendance after such Hour of Nine of the.

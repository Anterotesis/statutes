structions therein, as they could or might have had in cose this Act had not been passed.

4 XI. And Whereas the Commissioners for carrying the said Act 4 of the Fifty third Year of the Reign of His said late Majesty into 4 Execution, did some Time since, in order to encourage Builders 4 and other Persons to take the Ground on the Sides of the said new Street, and to erect Houses and Buildings thereon, contract 4 and agree for and on the Behalf of His Majesty to purchase and 4 redeem the Land Tax charged on all the Houses, Buildings and 4 Grounds belonging to the Crown, situate in the Parish of Saint 4 James, Westminster, which were wanted or were about to be

4 taken down, removed or used for the Purpose of forming the said new Street, and have since caused most of the Houses or Buildings aforesaid to be taken down, and have set out and appropriated a great Portion or Part of the Ground on which .the sam'c 4 stood, to the Formation of the said new Street or public Highway; and, in forming the Line of the said Street, have let some 4 small Portions of the Ground which formed the old Street or 4 public Highway, with Part of the Ground upon which the Land 4 Tax has been so redeemed, to Builders and other Persons who 4 have, in Expectation that the Whole thereof was exonerated 4 from the said Tax, erected and are erecting Houses and Buildings thereon; but doubts hhve arisen whether such Parts or Portions of the said Houses or Buildings as stand upon the Site of the said old Street, and the Builders or Occupiers of the same,

4 will not now become liable to be charged or assessed to the Payorient of the Land Tax in respect thereof: And Whereas such 4 Portion of the Ground in the said Parish, upon which the Land 4 Tax has been so redeemed, as has been appropriated to the publie Street as aforesaid, greatly exceeds such Portion of the Site 4 of the said old Street or public Highway, as has been so built 4 upon or is intended to be built upon, and it is therefore just and 4 reasonable that the latter should be exonerated from the said Tax in lieu and stead of the Ground so given up to the public .

W have, from time to time, passed for the Relief of Insolv-

ent Debtors, and the Discharge of many Prisoners, for small ' Debts, by charitable Donations, great Numbers of Persons gener-

tions: And Whereas the Duty of discharging Insolvent Debtors,

heretofore principally executed by His Majesty's superior Courts ( and the Judges of Assize in their respective Circuits, has caused ' great Obstruction and Delay, in many Instances, of the ordinary 4 Business of the said Courts and Judges; and it is deemed expedient that the Jurisdiction in all Matters of Insolvents should 4 be exclusively vested in a Court to be constituted for that Purpose in manner hereinafter mentioned Be it therefore enacted by The King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act, it shall be lawful for the Lord Lieutenant, or other Chief Governor or Governors

4 said late Majesty, the said Auditor General was invested with S u 4 the same Powers and Authorities in respect of the Accounts of

Public Expenditure in France as were given to and vested in hkfc 4 by virtue of the said recited Act of the Fifty third Year afore-

said, with respect to the Accounts of Public Expenditure in 4 Spain and Portugal: And Whereas the said Auditor General 4 hath returned with his Establishment to this Kingdom, by reason 4 whereof his peculiar Functions and Powers as Auditor General

under the said recited Acts have ceased and determined, but the 4 Examination and Audit of the said Accounts hath not yet been 4 completed, and it is therefore expedient that the Examination of the said Accounts should be proceeded in and completed under 4 his immediate and separate Superintendence and Directions, as 4 One of the Commissioners for auditing the Public Accounts, or 4 that some other special Provision should be made for that Pur-

4 poseBe it therefore enacted, That it shall be lawful for the said Ttetsury may

assign to the Commissioners for the time being, individually or Account*

as the said Commissioners of the Treasury shall from time to time deem expedient, and best calculated to ensure the most efficient Discharge of the several Duties of such Commissioners,

Officers, Clerks and other Persons respectively, and the most prompt and speedy Examination and Audit of the Public Accounts * of the Kingdom.

4 XX. And Whereas by the said first recited Act of the Forty 4 sixth Year of His late Majesty, Provision is made for the Prevention of improper or irregular Expenditure of the Public 4 Monies, by Orders of Persons employed in His Majesty's Service 4 in Parts beyond the Seas, such Persons not being themselves the 4 Accountants for such Expenditure: And Whereas it is expedient to make further Provision in respect thereof Be it therefore enacted, That whenever it shall be made appear to the Public Officers said Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, that any Sum or abroad author-Sums which shall have been issuea, paid or expended, oy Orders I,n3 direct-firom any Person employed in His Majesty's Services, in Parts y0rir-beyond the Seas, (such Person not being himself the Accountant regular Experw for such Issue, Payment or Expenditure,) ought not to have been diture, mayvhjr-so issued, paid or expended, or ought not to be charged to the Order of the Public, then and in every such case the said Commissioners of His *

Majesty's Treasury, or any Three or more of them, shall there- acc^t tefore upon call upon the Person by whose Orders or under whose Cmawsunen^ Authority such Issue, Payment or Expenditure shall have been made, for an Explanation of the Circumstances under which the same was orderea or authorized, and the Reasons or Grounds upon which such Order or Authority was founded; and if upon receiving such Explanation, the said Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury shall still be of Opinion, that such Person ought to be charged with the Amount of such Issue, Payment or Expenditure, it shall be lawful for the said Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, or any Three or more of them, by Warrant under their Hands, to authorize and direct the Commissioners for auditing the Public Accounts, to require the Person by whose Order or Author rity such Issue, Payment or Expenditure shall have been made, to-render an Account of the Monies so issued, paid or expended; and the Person so required to account shall thereupon be and be deemed a Public Accountant with respect to such Monies, in as^ full and ample a Manner, to all Intents and Purposes, as if the Amount of such Monies had actually been issued to him by way of Imprest and upon Account: Provided always, that nothing Proviso for herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to deprive Application t* such Person of such Relief by Application to the Court of Exche- Exchequer, quer, as by the said recited Act of the Forty sixth Year aforesaid is provided in this Behalf.

Half Pay, Pensions on the Compassionate List, Pensions to the Widows of Officers of the Army, Officers allowed to retire on full Pay, Pensions to wounded Officers, Pay of General Officers not being Colonels of Regiments, Royal Bounty to Relatives of deceased Officers, and Pay of Adjutants of Local Militia: And Whereas in consequence of the Reduction of the Army at the Termination of the late War, and the Regulation for issuing Half Pay by Quarterly instead of Half Yearly Payments as formerly, and from other Causes, the Payments on account of the above Services have greatly increased in Number: And Whereas it appears upon Examination of the Accounts of those Services for past Years, that from various Circumstances connected with the then existing State of those Branches of the Public Service, the Rules and Regulations prescribing the Mode of making such. Payments, in various Instances, have not been strictly observed, and the Payments have been made upon irregular and imperfect Vouchers: And Whereas in consequence of such Informalities, considerable Delay has arisen and is likely to arise in the Settlement of the Accounts of the Paymaster General, by reason of the Commissioners for auditing the Public Accounts not having a discretionary Power to admit the Documents in question as sufficient Vouchers Be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Commissioners for auditing the Public Accounts, to pass and allow Articles of Discharge in the Accounts of the above mentioned Services, according to their Judgment and Discretion, in all cases where they shall see Ground so to do, although the Receipts, Certificates, Affidavits or Declarations may not in all respects be according to the Forms prescribed, or where such Documents may be otherwise defective, provided it shall appear to them that the Payments have been actually made and duly authorized, and that there be no Suspicion of Fraud.

4 amination of Accounts of the Receipt and Expenditure of the 4 Colonial Revenues in the Islands of Ceylon, Mauritius, Malta,

4 Trinidad and in the Settlements of the Cape of Good Hope, for 4 Five Years: And Whereas it is provided by the said recited 4 Act, that the same should continue in force for Five Years,

4 and no longer: And Whereas by virtue of an Act passed in the 4 Fifty ninth Year of His late Majesty, intituled An Act to continue, until the Thirtieth Day of July One thousand eight hundred 4 and twenty, an Act of the lifty fourth Year of His present Alajesty, for the effectual Examination of Accounts oj the Receipt 4 and Expenditure of the Colonial Revenues in the Islands of 4 Ceylon, Mauritius, Malta, Trinidad and in the Settlements of the Cape of Good Hope; and of another Act passed in the 4 First Year of His present Majesty, intituled An Act to continue 4 until the Thirtieth Day of July One thousand eight hundred and 4 twenty-one, an Act of the Fifty fourth Year of His late Majesty,

4 for the effectual Examination of the Accounts of the Receipt and 4 Expenditure of the Colonial Revenues in the Islands of Ceylon,

of the Fifty fourth Year of His late Majesty, and the Provision 4 thereby made for the speedy and efiectual Examination and 4 Audit in Great Britain of the Accounts of the Receipt and Expenditure of the Colonial Revenues in the said several last men-

tioned Colonies or Settlements, hath been found by Experience 4 to be of great public Utility, and it is expedient that the same

His Majesty's Pleasure; and the Secretary to the said Commissioners, and all Officers, Clerks and other Persons appointed by the Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, pursuant to the said Act,

to aid and assist in the Execution thereof, shall continue to hold their respective Offices during the Pleasure of the said Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury; and the said Commissioners,

Secretary, Officers, Cierks and other Persons respectively, shall, from and after the Thirtieth Day of July One thousand eight hundred and twenty one, and during their Continuance in the said Offices respectively, have, use and exercise all and every the Powers and Authorities vested in them under and by virtue of the said recited Act of the Fifty fourth Year of His late Majesty, or of the said Letters Patent, and Appointments granted in pursuance thereof, for all or any of the Purposes therein expressed, in such and the same manner, and as fully and effectually to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever, as if the same Powers and Authorities had been expressly re-enacted in this Act.

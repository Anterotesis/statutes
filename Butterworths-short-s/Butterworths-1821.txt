1 other Purposes, in small Portions: And Whereas die usual Mode of granting and passing Leases of the Estates of the Crown within the Survey of His Majesty's Exchequer, under the Great

Seal or the Exchequer Seal, is unavoidably attended with

great Delay, Inconvenience and Expence; and it would encourage Builders and other Persons to take Leases and make Improve-

Or Amount of such Compensation or Satisfaction shall be settled, ascertained and determined, by such competent and indifferent Person as the said respective Referees shall, before they shall respectively proceed to the Consideration of the Mattery so referred to them, by Writing under their Hands, nominate and appoint to act as Umpire concerning the Premises, and the Judgment and Determination of such Referees or Umpire therein shall be final, binding and conclusive, to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever; and such Referees and Umpire are hereby respectively empowered to send for Persons and Papers, and to examine Witnesses upon Oath, if necessary, which Oath any One of the Persons so to be nominated a Referee or Umpire as aforesaid is hereby authorized and empowered to administer; and the Amount of such Compensation or Satisfaction, when so ascertained as aforesaid, may be paid by the said Lord High Treasurer, or the said Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, out of the Land Revenues of the Crown, or out of any Monies applicable as Land Revenues of the Crown.

IV. And Whereas by the said recited Act of the Forty eighth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty, Powers were given to the Surveyor General, with the Approbation and Authority of the said Lord High Treasurer, or the Commissioners of the Treasury, to mak* Exchanges of any Parcel or Parcels of Land belonging to the Crown, in the Survey and ordering of the Exchequer, for Lands of equal or nearly equal Value, in the Manner and under the Regulations therein mentioned: And Whereas such Powers are now vested in and exercised by the Commissioners of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land Revenues for the Time being, and have been found in many cases to be beneficial; but Doubts have arisen whether any Exchanges can be made, by virtue thereof, of any of the Possessions of the Crown in Perpetuity, for any Messuages, Lands or Hereditaments held by the Persons making the same, for any partial Estate, or for any Term or Terms of Years or Chattel Interest;

and it is expedient that such Doubts should be removed, and that such Powers should be extended to authorize the Acceptance on the Part of the Crown of any Messuages, Lands or Hereditaments held by the Person or Persons maxing such Exchanges for any partial Estate, or any Term or Terms of Years,

or Chattel Interest, where the Reversion or Remainder of such Messuages, Lands or Hereditaments expectant on the Determination of such Estate or Interest, shall be either immediately or ultimately in the Crown, in Exchange for any Messuages, 4 Lands, or Hereditaments held by the Crown in Perpetuity; Be it therefore further enacted, That the said Commissioners of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, shall have full Power and Authority, with the Approbation of the said Lord High Treasurer, or the Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury for the Time being, or any Three or more of them, to convey any of the Possessions of the Crown in England or Wales within the Survey and Ordering of the Exchequer, in Perpetuity or otherwise, in Exchange for any Messuages, Lands or Hereditaments in England or Wales, held by the Person or Persons making the same, for any partial Estate or Interest, or for any Term or Terms of

Years,

A.D. 1821. 1° & GEO. IV. C. 52.

Years, or any Chattel Interest, where the Reversion'or Remainder of such Messuages, Lands or Hereditaments expectant upon the Determination of such partial Estate, Term or Interest, shall be either immediately or ultimately in the Crown; all which Exchanges shall be made and carried into Effect in such or the like Manner, and under such or the like Rules and Regulations, as nearly as Circumstances will admit, as the Exchanges authorized by the said Act of the Forty eighth Year aforesaid are now usually made or carried into Execution; and all Sums of Money to be paid or received for Equality of Exchange, shall be paid, received or applied in like manner as any Monies to be paid or received for the like Purpose upon any Exchanges made under the said Act are now payable or applicable; and all Deeds or other Instruments, by which the same Exchanges shall be effected, or which shall relate thereto, shall be exempt from all Stamp Duties; and, in making such Exchanges, the Lands or Possessions of His Majesty so to be given in Exchange shall be vested in the Person or Persons to whom the same shall be conveyed, for such Estate or Estates, Uses, Trusts, Intents or Purposes, as shall be in or by such Deeds or Instruments, or by Reference therein to any other Deeds or Instruments, expressed or declared of and concerning the same; and the Messuages, Lands and Hereditaments to be given or taken in Exchange for the same shall vest in His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, or in the Person or Persons to whom the same shall be conveyed, in Trust for His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, in Right of his Crown, for all the Estate, Term, Title or Interest of the Person or Persons making the same Exchange, or for so much or such Part or Parts thereof as shall be agreed, contracted or intended to be given, conveyed or assigned to or in Trust for His Majesty, in or upon the Treaty for such Exchange; and all such Exchanges, when so made, shall be good, valid and effectual, any Act or Acts of Parliament, Law or Usage to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding.

V. And Whereas Doubts have been entertained, whether any Stewards of Courts, Game Keepers, Forestal or other Officers of

any of His Majesty's Hundreds, Manors, Lordships, Forests,

Chases or Warrens, and other Places, can be legally appointed

for or within any such Hundreds, Honors, Manors, Lordships,

Forests, Chases, Warrens or other Places by the Commissioners

for the Time being of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land

1 Manors and Lordships, Forests, Chases, Warrens and other

Places in certain Cases; Be it therefore further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful to and for the Commissioners for the Time being of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, on Behalf of His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, by any Instrument in Writing under their Hands, or the Hands of any Two of them, from time to time to appoint such Person or Persons as"

IX. And Whereas the Theatre, situate on the East Side of the

Hay market y in the Parish of Saint Martin in the Fields, Westminster, in the County of Middlesex, is erected and stands on V Land belonging to the Crown in the said Parish, and the Lease

under which the same hath been long held hath lately expired, and the said Theatre is now about to be taken down and a new Theatre is erecting in lieu thereof on other Land of the Crown

immediately adjoining thereto, and which will front towards the

said Street in like Manned as the said former Theatre, and it will tend to improve the Access to the said new Theatre, and to promote the Convenience of Persons frequenting the same, if a Co-

lonnade were erected in the Front thereof in lieu of that in

Front of the said Theatre so about to be taken down and re-

X. And Whereas the Commissioners for carrying the said Act of the Fifty third Year of the Reign of His said late Majesty into Execution have, under the Power thereby vested in them, purchased or contracted on His Majesty's Behalf to purchase all or most of the Buildings which were situate between the East Side of Swallow Street and the West Side of King Street, and also several Buildings in and adjacent to Vine Street, and have taken down most of the said Buildings and have appropriated Part of the Sites whereon the same stood to the Formation of the New Street now forming under the said Act, and have, on His Majesty's Behalf, let or contracted to let the Remainder of such Sites or Ground to Persons who are now building several large and commodious Houses thereon; and inasmuch as several of such Buildings have been erected or are intended to be erected with a View to carry on certain Trades or Businesses therein, with Warehouses, Workshops or Outhouses adapted for such Trades, it will be a Convenience to the Persons occupying the same and an advantage JLo that Part of the Estate of the Crown, if Gateways were made from some of the said Premises into King Street aforesaid, and also if a Gateway were made from some of the same Premises into Vine Street aforesaid, so as to afford Access for Carts or other Carriages from or out of the said Streets to such Warehouses or other Buildings; Be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful to and for the Commissioners of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, on His Majesty's Behalf, to licence and empower such of the Builders or Occupiers of the said Houses or Buildings so erected or erecting or to be erected as aforesaid, as shall be desirous so to do, to open or make any Gateway or Passage from their said Houses and Premises into King Street, and also to open a Gateway or Passage at the South East End of Vine Street aforesaid, facing Little Vine Street, so as to afford Access for Horses, Carts or Carriages from such Streets to the Warehouses or other Buildings belonging* or to belong to the said Houses, so as the Person or Persons to whom such Licences shall be granted be bound or obliged to bear the first Expence of paving the Entrance into such Gateways in a proper Manner, and such Licences shall be and are hereby declared to be good and sufficient Authority for the making such Gateways, taking up, removing and altering the Pavement in Front thereof in the said Streets, and doing all Things requisite thereto, and for the Person or Persons to whom the same shall be

granted,

panted, his, her or their Executors, ' Administrators or Assigns, to keep and use such Gateways as Accesses to his, her and their Warehouses and Buildings at all Times thereafter, without any other Licence or Authority whatsoever; any thing in any existing Act or Acts of Parliament, or any Law or Usage to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding; saving always to the Committee or other proTiso for Persons who for the time being shall have the Controul of the Rights of Corn-Pavements of the Parish of Saint James, Westminster, all such mittee of Pavc-Powers and Authorities relative to the paving and repairing the ^*ent* °^rSaint said Gateways, and removing and preventing Nuisances and Ob- *

structions therein, as they could or might have had in cose this Act had not been passed.

XI. And Whereas the Commissioners for carrying the said Act of the Fifty third Year of the Reign of His said late Majesty into Execution, did some Time since, in order to encourage Builders and other Persons to take the Ground on the Sides of the said new Street, and to erect Houses and Buildings thereon, contract and agree for and on the Behalf of His Majesty to purchase and redeem the Land Tax charged on all the Houses, Buildings and Grounds belonging to the Crown, situate in the Parish of Saint James, Westminster, which were wanted or were about to be

taken down, removed or used for the Purpose of forming the said new Street, and have since caused most of the Houses or Buildings aforesaid to be taken down, and have set out and appropriated a great Portion or Part of the Ground on which the sam'c 4 stood, to the Formation of the said new Street or public Highway; and, in forming the Line of the said Street, have let some small Portions of the Ground which formed the old Street or public Highway, with Part of the Ground upon which the Land Tax has been so redeemed, to Builders and other Persons who have, in Expectation that the Whole thereof was exonerated from the said Tax, erected and are erecting Houses and Buildings thereon; but doubts hhve arisen whether such Parts or Portions of the said Houses or Buildings as stand upon the Site of the said old Street, and the Builders or Occupiers of the same,

will not now become liable to be charged or assessed to the Payorient of the Land Tax in respect thereof: And Whereas such Portion of the Ground in the said Parish, upon which the Land Tax has been so redeemed, as has been appropriated to the publie Street as aforesaid, greatly exceeds such Portion of the Site of the said old Street or public Highway, as has been so built upon or is intended to be built upon, and it is therefore just and reasonable that the latter should be exonerated from the said Tax in lieu and stead of the Ground so given up to the public.

Use as aforesaid Be it therefore further enacted, That no Part Such Houses or Portion of the Ground situate in the said Parish of Saint James, kuilt *> the new Westminster, which at the Time of the passing the said Act of the ^ant

Fifty third Year of the Reign of His said late Majesty, formed Wesu

Part of any of the public Streets or Highways thereby intended to minster, as are be widened, altered or improved, nor any Houses or other Build- situate on the ings erected or to be erected thereon, nor any Person or Persons Jsoftheold holding or occupying the same for or in respect thereof, shall be liable to be assessed, rated or charged with the said Tax or any xax.

Portion thereof; but shall be wholly freed, exonerated and discharged

An Act to repeal so much of an Act, of the Fifth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Second, relating to Bankrupts, as requires the Meetings under Commissions of Bankrupt to be holden in the Guildhall of the City of London; and for building Offices in the said City for the Meetings of the Commissioners; and for the more regular Transaction of Business in Bankruptcy.

[10th July 1821.]

WHEREAS by an Act made and passed in the Fifth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Second, intituled An Act to prevent the committing of Fraud

5 by Bankrupts, it is amongst other Things enacted, that where

+any Commission of Bankrupt shall issue out, from and after the Twenty fourth Day of June One thousand seven hundred and thirty two, the Commissioners therein named, or the major Part of them thereby authorized, shall forthwith, after they have declared the Person or Persons against whom such Commission shall issue a Bankrupt or Bankrupts, cause Notice thereof to be given in the London Gazette, and shall appoint a Time and Place for the Creditors to meet, which Meeting for the City of London and all Places within the Bills of Mortality, shall be at the Guildhall of the said City, in order to choose an Assignee or Assignees of the said Bankrupt's Estate and Effects; and it was

5 33. 4 thereby further enacted, that every Person or Persons choBen

or whe should be chosen Assignees of the Estate and Effects of such Bankrupt, should at some time after the Expiration of

at which Time the Creditors who had not proved their Debts should then be at liberty to prove the same; which Meeting

A.D. 1821. 1° & 2° GEO. IV. C. 115. 455

+for the City of London and all Places within the Bills of Mortality should be at the Guildhall of the said City: And Whereas the Business in Bankruptcy has of late Years greatly increased, and in consequence thereof proper and sufficient Accommodation cannot now be furnished to the Commissioners for transacting such Business at the said Guildhall of the said City of London: And Whereas, for the Purpose of providing a Remedy for such Inconvenience, an Address was ordered to be presented to His Royal Highness The Prince Regent, by the House of Commons, on the Thirtieth Day of June One thousand eight hundred and nineteen, praying that His Royal Highness would be graciously pleased to give Directions, that a Sum not exceeding Twenty thousand Pounds should be issued for the Purpose of erecting a suitable Building for Transaction of Business in Bankruptcy: And Whereas in pursuance of such Address the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury have authorized and empowered William Courtenay of Duke Street, Westminster, in the County of Middlesex, Esquire, One of the Masters of His Majesty's High Court of Chancery, Stephen Rumbold Lushington Esquire, One of the Secretaries of His Majesty's Treasury, Matthew Wood of South Audley Street, Grosvenor Square, in the County of Middlesex, Esquire, One of the Aldermen of the said City of London, Thomas Wilson of the same City, Merchant, and Henry Wrottesley of Lincolns Inn, in the said County of Middlesex, Esquire,

as Trustees for the Public, to treat and contract for the Purchase of the Piece or Parcel of Ground hereinafter described, on which such intended new Building may be erected and buih,

and also for the erecting and completing the same for the Purposes aforesaid: And Whereas in further pursuance of such Contract with Address, a Contract hath been entered into by the Trustees the Corporation above named, with the said City of London, for the Purchase of Londoz.

of the Piece of Ground nearly adjoining the Guildhall of the said City, hereinafter more particularly described; and in pursuance of such Contract, by Indenture of Feoffment with Livery of Seisin endorsed, duly enrolled in His Majesty's High Court of Chancery, bearing Date the Thirteenth Day of April in the Year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and twenty, and made between the Mayor and Commonalty and

Citizens of the City of London of the First Part; the said William Courtenay, Stephen Rumbold Lushington, Matthew Wood, Thomas Wilson and Henry Wrottesley, of the Second Part;

and being on the West Side of Basinghall Street, in the Parish of Saint Michael Bassishaw of the City of London, Part of i which Ground lately formed Part of the Site of the ancient Cloth Market of Blackwell Hall, or of the Buildings or Offices belonging thereto, and other Part thereof was the Site, or Part

of the Site, of Two Messuages or Dwelling Houses situate on the West Side of Basinghall Street aforesaid, being Numbers Eighty two and Eighty three of the said Street; the whole of

which said Piece or Parcel of Ground measures on the North

Side thereof, abutting or adjoining to a Messuage or Tenement

and Premises in Basinghall Street aforesaid, now or late in the

Occupation of Maitland, Esquire, Eighty seven Feet

of Assize, little more or less, in a broken Line; on the East Side thereof, abutting on Basinghall Street aforesaid, Ninety

Feet Nine Inches of Assize, including Half the Thickness of the Party Wall, little more or less; on the West Side thereof,

abutting or adjoining to a vacant Piece of Ground, which is intended to be left as a Yard or Passage between the Ground thereby intended to be conveyed, and the new Courts of King's

Bench and Common Pleas, One hundred and one Feet Six Inches of Assize, little more or less, including Half the Party

Wall; and on the South Side thereof, abutting on an intended

+new Street or Carriage Way leading from Basinghall Street aforesaid, to Guildhall Yard, Eighty seven Feet of Assize, little more or less, as the said Piece or Parcel of Ground and the Abuttals and Boundaries thereof are more particularly described and delineated in the Ground Plan thereof drawn in the Margin of the Indenture now in recital, together with the free Use and Liberty of Way and Passage in, over and upon the said Court Yard or Ground lying between the Western Boundary of the Piece or Parcel of Ground thereby intended to be conveyed, and the said intended new Buildings for the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas, at all times between the Hours of Ten o'Clock in the Forenoon and Four o'clock in the Afternoon of every Day in the Year, except Sundays, Good Friday and Christmas Day; but excepting and always reserving to the said Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens, their Successors and Assigns, the Right to have an Entrance Gate to the said Yard or Passage, and to lock or fasten the same Gate, so as to prevent all Access to or Liberty of Way through the same Gate and Passage, except when such Right of Way or Passage is to be exercised between the Hours of Ten and Four as aforesaid;

to hold the said Piece of Ground and Premises unto and to the

Use of the said William Courtenay, Stephen Rumbold Lushington, Matthew Wood, Thomas Wilson and Henry Wrottesley,

their Heirs and Assigns for ever, in Trust for His Majesty and His Successors; and to the Intent and Purpose only, that certain Buildings might forthwith be erected on the said Ground, for the Meetings of the Commissioners of Bankrupts, and for Transaction of Business in Bankruptcy: And Whereas such Buildings have been accordingly erected, and are nearly completed, on the said Piece of Ground for the Purposes aforesaid: And Whereas by

A.D. 1821. 1° & 2° GEO. IV. C. 115. 457

reason of the said hereinbefore in part recited Act of Parliament, such Meetings of the Commissioners in Bankruptcy as are therein mentioned must of Necessity be held at the Guildhall of the said City of London; and it is therefore expedient to repeal so much of the said recited Act as compels such Meetings to be there holden, and to direct that all Public Meetings in Bankruptcy, and also such other Meetings as are hereinafter mentioned, shall be held in the said newly erected Buildings: And

Whereas, besides the Inconveniencies arising from the Want of appropriate Places of Meeting, considerable Inconvenience has also been experienced from their being no Provision made under the existing Laws for keeping a Registry or Journal of the Proceedings under Commissions, and such Registry would tend to the Regularity and Uniformity of such Proceedings: And Whereas it is expedient that Commissioners acting under any Commission of Bankruptcy should, whilst so acting, have Power or Authority to remove or order any Person or Persons to be removed or taken out of the Room or Place in which they may be sitting under such Commission, who shall commit or be guilty of any Riot or Disturbance, or who shall interrupt them in the Exercise of their Duty, and to have such Person or Persons taken before any Alderman or Magistrate acting in the Commission of the Peace, to be dealt with according to Law: And Whereas by a Resolution of the House of Commons of the Twenty ninth Day of June One thousand eight hundred and twenty one, the further Sum of Two thousand three hundred Pounds was granted to His Majesty, to enable the said Trustees to defray the Expences of such new Building, and of completing, fitting up and furnishing the same for the Purposes aforesaid: And Whereas it is expedient that a Fund should be provided, for the Purpose of ensuring to the Public the Repayment of the Sums so voted for the Purposes aforesaid Be it therefore enacted by The King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That so much of the hereinbefore recited Act of the Fifth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Second, as directs that any Meetings holden under Commissions of Bankruptcy should be holden at the Guildhall of the City of London, shall be and the same is hereby repealed {subject only to the Proviso next hereinafter contained).

II. Provided always, and be it further enacted, That such Part but to remain as aforesaid of the said recited Act of the Fifth Year of the Reign of His said late Majesty, shall continue in force until the Building intended to be erected on the Piece of Ground comprised in the hereinbefore recited Indenture of Feoffment shall be completed, and Notice of such Building being ready for Use, signed by the Lord High Chancellor, Lord Keeper or Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal for the time being, shall be inserted in the London Gazette, therein fixing the time from which Business shall be transacted in such new Building, and which Building shall be called The Court of Commissioners of Bankrupt."

IV. And be it further enacted, That the Piece or Parcel of Ground described in and conveyed by the Indenture of Feoffment hereinbefore recited or expressed so to be, and all Erections and Buildings now erecting and building, or which shall be erected and built thereon, shall from henceforth be and the same are hereby vested in the said William Courtenay, Stephen Rumbold Lushington, Matthew Wood, Thomas Wilson and Henry Wrottesley, their Heirs and Assigns for ever, in Trust for His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, and to the Intent and Purpose that the said Piece of Ground, and the Buildings thereon, may for ever hereafter be used and applied for the Purposes and in Manner mentioned and described by this Act; subject to such Rules and Regulations respecting the Use and Occupation thereof, and of the Rooms and Chambers thereunto belonging, as the Lord High Chancellor, Lord Keeper or Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal, shall from time to time order and direct, and to and for no other Use, Intent or Purpose whatsoever; and the said William Courtenay, Stephen Rumbold Lushington, Matthew Wood, Thomas Wilson and Henry Wrottesley, and the Survivors and Survivor of them, and the lieirs and Assigns of such Survivor, are accordingly hereby appointed, and shall from henceforth be and continue Commissioners and Trustees for carrying into Effect the Purposes of this Act.

V. Provided always, and be it further enacted, That when any of them the said William Courtenay, Stephen Rumbold Lushington, Matthew Wood, Thomas Wilson and Henry Wrottesley, or any future Commissioner or Commissioners, Trustee or Trustees, to be appointed as hereinafter is mentioned, shall die, or be desirous of being discharged of and from, or refuse or decline or become incapable to act as a Commissioner and Trustee for the Purposes of this Act, then and so often as by the Means aforesaid the Number of the said Commissioners and Trustees shall be reduced to Three, it shall and may be lawful to and for the Lord High Chancellor, or Lord Keeper or Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal for the Time being, by Writing under his or their Hand or Hands, to nominate and appoint any other Person or Persons to be a Commissioner and Trustee, or Commissioners and Trustees, for the Purposes of this Act, in the Place or Stead of the Trustees who shall have so died, or desired to be discharged, or refused, declined or become incapable to act as aforesaid.

XX. And Whereas by the said first recited Act of the Forty sixth Year of His late Majesty, Provision is made for the Prevention of improper or irregular Expenditure of the Public Monies, by Orders of Persons employed in His Majesty's Service in Parts beyond the Seas, such Persons not being themselves the Accountants for such Expenditure: And Whereas it is expedient to make further Provision in respect thereof Be it therefore enacted, That whenever it shall be made appear to the Public Officers said Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, that any Sum or abroad author-Sums which shall have been issuea, paid or expended, oy Orders I, n3 direct-firom any Person employed in His Majesty's Services, in Parts y0rir-beyond the Seas, (such Person not being himself the Accountant regular Experw for such Issue, Payment or Expenditure,) ought not to have been diture, mayvhjr-so issued, paid or expended, or ought not to be charged to the Order of the Public, then and in every such case the said Commissioners of His *

Payments, in various Instances, have not been strictly observed, and the Payments have been made upon irregular and imperfect Vouchers: And Whereas in consequence of such Informalities, considerable Delay has arisen and is likely to arise in the Settlement of the Accounts of the Paymaster General, by reason of the Commissioners for auditing the Public Accounts not having a discretionary Power to admit the Documents in question as sufficient Vouchers Be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Commissioners for auditing the Public Accounts, to pass and allow Articles of Discharge in the Accounts of the above mentioned Services, according to their Judgment and Discretion, in all cases where they shall see Ground so to do, although the Receipts, Certificates, Affidavits or Declarations may not in all respects be according to the Forms prescribed, or where such Documents may be otherwise defective, provided it shall appear to them that the Payments have been actually made and duly authorized, and that there be no Suspicion of Fraud.

of the Fifty fourth Year of His late Majesty, and the Provision thereby made for the speedy and effectual Examination and Audit in Great Britain of the Accounts of the Receipt and Expenditure of the Colonial Revenues in the said several last mentioned Colonies or Settlements, hath been found by Experience to be of great public Utility, and it is expedient that the same

should be made perpetual Be it therefore enacted, That the Recited Act of said recited Act of the Fifty fourth Year of the Reign of His late 54 G. s. c. 184. Majesty, and all the Powers and Authorities, Clauses and Pro- perpetual, visions therein contained, except in so far as the same may be varied, altered or repealed by this Act, shall be and the same are hereby made perpetual.

His Majesty's Pleasure; and the Secretary to the said Commissioners, and all Officers, Clerks and other Persons appointed by the Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, pursuant to the said Act,

to aid and assist in the Execution thereof, shall continue to hold their respective Offices during the Pleasure of the said Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury; and the said Commissioners,

Secretary, Officers, Clerks and other Persons respectively, shall, from and after the Thirtieth Day of July One thousand eight hundred and twenty one, and during their Continuance in the said Offices respectively, have, use and exercise all and every the Powers and Authorities vested in them under and by virtue of the said recited Act of the Fifty fourth Year of His late Majesty, or of the said Letters Patent, and Appointments granted in pursuance thereof, for all or any of the Purposes therein expressed, in such and the same manner, and as fully and effectually to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever, as if the same Powers and Authorities had been expressly re-enacted in this Act.

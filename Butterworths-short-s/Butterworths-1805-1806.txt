II. And be it further enacted, That every Surveyor so to be employed, in all Cases where the present Road or any Part thereof is not made in the most level or most convenient Direction, shall survey and make Maps of a new Line or Lines for a Road in lieu thereof; and that in no Part of any such new Line shall the Ascent or Descent of the Road when finished exceed the Rate or Proportion of One Foot in Height or Fall in each Thirty five Feet of the Length thereof, if the same be practicable, without causing such a great Increase of Distance as to delay considerably the Carriage of the Mails; and if the same be not practicable, then such Surveyor shall find out and survey the most practicable lane which shall be nearest in its Ascent or Descent to such Proportion of Height or Fall.

III. And be it further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for any such Surveyor so to be appointed by the Postmasters General of Ireland, for the Purposes of this Act, and for any other Person or Persons employed for that Purpose, to survey and measure any Line intended for a new Road, or for the Alteration of any existing Road under this Act, and to enter on any Lands or Grounds, and to do all other Matters and Things necessary in the Execution of their Duty and Employment under this Act, without being deemed a Trespasser or Trespassers, and without being liable to any Obstruction whatever; provided such Person or Persons shall have a Certificate in Writing, under the Hands of the said Postmasters General, or under the Hands of any Two Justices of the Peace within the District, that such Surveyor or other Person or Persons is or are employed for that Purpose.

V. And be it further enacted, That every such Surveyor shall be sworn before he begins his Survey, to make the same without Fear, Favour or Partiality, to the best of his Opinion and Judgment, according to the true Intent of this Act.

VIII. And be it further enacted, That there shall be annexed to every such Estimate, an Affidavit of the Surveyor, or of Two credible and experienced Persons, that the Sum contained in the Estimate is a reasonable Charge, and is the least for which the Work can be effectually and substantially executed to the best of his or their Judgment; and that every such Surveyor shall also annex to his Map or Survey, an Affidavit sworn by him, that any Alterations in the existing Road recommended by such Surveyor in such Map or Survey have been proposed by him as the most advisable in his Judgment, agreeably to the Intent of this Act, between the Points therein stated; due regard being had to the most level and practicable Line, without occasioning such an Increase of Distance as might be productive of Delay to the Carriage of the Mails.

* Danger of such Communication is greatly increased by Persons

* not being prevented from going within the Stations allotted for c the Performance of Quarantine by such Ships or Vessels Be it therefore further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful to and for His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, by His or their Order or Orders in Council, notified by Proclamation, or published in the London Gazette, to prohibit all Persons, Ships, Boats and Vessels whatsoever, from going under any Pretence whatsoever, within the Limits of any Station, which, by His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, by any such Order or Orders in Council, has been, or may be assigned for the Performance of Quarantine by any Ships or Vessels without clean Bills of Health; and that if any Person whatsoever, after such Notification or Publication of any such Order or Orders in Council, shall presume, under any Pretence whatsoever, to go with any Ship, Boat or Vessel within the Limits of any such Station, he or she shall, for every such Offence, forfeit and pay the Sum of Five hundred Pounds.

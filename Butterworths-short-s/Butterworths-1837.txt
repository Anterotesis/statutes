the due Execution of Works contracted for, or of the Performance Surveyor as to *

of Contracts, which Contractors are by the said Act required to due Execution obtain from the County Surveyor previous to applying for Pay- of Contracts at ment, has been found inconvenient; and it is expedient to amend the Sessions at the said Act in that respect; be it therefore enacted, That it shall wh, 4Jh they

be expedient for such Contractors, and they are hereby required, or ay* to produce such Certificates as aforesaid at the Sessions at which they may apply for Payment; any thing in the said Act requiring such Certificates to be procured and lodged at any previous Time to the contrary notwithstanding.

Prejudice to the Public, as in the said Act mentioned, but it is by

the said Act required that the Necessity of such Repairs should ve/

be notified to such Justices by the County Surveyor: And whereas it is expedient to dispense with such previous Notification; be it therefore enacted, That so much of the said Act as requires a previous Notification of the Necessity of such Repairs as aforesaid on the Part of the County Surveyor to such Justices shall

be and the same is hereby repealed: Provided that nothing Piwwx herein contained shall be construed to dispense with the Certificate of the County Surveyor, to be given after the Execution of the Work, that the Money appears to have been faithfully and honestly expended pursuant to the Order made by Such Justices.

to be paid over by him to the Master of the Rolls, who out of the same has to pay Taxes and Duties, which form Part of the fc said Consolidated Fund, and then by virtue of the said first-recited Act receives back from the said Consolidated Fund the Amount of such Taxes and Duties, and any other Deficiency in the Amount of his Salary: And whereas the several complicated Transactions aforesaid would be rendered unnecessary if the said ancient Payments, amounting to the yearly Sum of Fortyfive Pounds Eighteen Shillings, and Seven-pence and the said yearly Sum of One thousand two hundred Pounds, were no longer to be paid by the Clerk of the Hanaper to the Master of the Rolls, or accounted for as Part of his annual Salary: And whereas the Fees payable to the Master of the Rolls by the Registrars of the Court of Chancery consist of the Sum of Six 4 Shillings and Eight-pence out the Fees received by them from the Suitors upon every Decree or Dismission, which are Taxes on the Administration of Justice, and the same could not, it is apprehended, be abolished by virtue [of the Act passed in the Third and Fourth Years of the Reign of His late Majesty, intituled An Act for the Regulation of the Proceedings and Practice of certain Officers of the High Court of Chancery in England, 4 because the same had been made to contribute towards the Payment of the Salary of the Master of the Rolls: And whereas the only Fees payable to the Master of the Roils which are received by his Under Secretary are the Sum of Five Pounds Seven Shillings and Sixpence upon the Admission of every Sworn Clerk,

and a Sum of Five Shillings for allowing a Marshalsea Court Writ or Warrant to be executed within the Liberty of the Rolls:

And whereas it is expedient that the said Fee or Sum of Six 4 Shillings and Eight-pence payable to the Master of the Rolls upon every Decree or Dismission, and the said Fees payable to the Master of the Rolls on the Admission of Clerks in Court, and on Leave to execute Marshalsea Court Writs within the Liberty of the Rolls, should be abolished: And whereas it will be more convenient, and more consistent with the Honour and Dignity of the Master of the Rolls, that the said full annual Sum of Seven thousand Pounds should be received by him wholly out of the said Consolidated Fund, and that the said Fees and Payments now received by him, and other the Emoluments of his Office, 4 should be paid into the Receipt of Her Majesty's Exchequer in ease of the public Revenue, than that he should receive such Fees, 4 Payments, and Emoluments, and have to account for the same as Parts of his Salary :f Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said Act of the Seventeenth Year of the Reign of King George

' ment, Conveyance, and Transport of such Prisoners, should be ' charged on the said Rates for the said Isle of Ely: Be it

therefore declared and enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That by the Gaol at Cambridge mentioned in the herein-before recited Act was meant and intended the Gaol for the said County of Cambridge situate at Chesterton in the same County; and that all Persons who if the said recited Act had not passed might have been committed to or confined in the Gaol at Ely may be committed to and confined in the Gaol for the Time being of the said County of Cambridge, and that all Justices who if the said Act had not been passed might have committed to the Gaol of the said Isle of Ely shall have full Power to commit to the Gaol for the Time being of the said County of Cambridge,

An Act for better enabling Her Majesty to confer certain Powers and Immunities on trading and other Companies.

[17th July 1837.]

WHEREAS divers Associations are and may be formed for

* trading or other Purposes, some of which Associations it ' would be inexpedient to incorporate by Royal Charters, although

it would be expedient to confer on them some of the Privileges of and incident to Corporations created by Royal Charters, and

also to invest such Associations or some of them with certain

other Powers and Privileges: And whereas it would also be ex-

pedient to extend the Powers of Her Majesty in reference to the

Creation of Corporations, and to the conferring of Privileges

upon Corporations, and upon other Bodies or Companies enabled

to sue and be sued: And whereas by an Act passed in the Sixth

Year of the Reign of His Majesty King George the Fourth, intituled An Act to repeal so much of an Act passed in the Sixth Year of His late Majesty King George the First as relates to the restraining of several extravagant and unwarrantable Practices in the said Act mentioned; and for conferring additional Powers upon His Majesty with respect to the granting of Charters of Incorporation to trading and other Companies, it was amongst

in the Fourth and Fifth Years of the Reign of His late Majesty,

intituled An Act to enable His Majesty to invest trading and other Companies with the Powers necessary for the due Conduct of their Affairs, and for the Security of the Rights and Interests of their Creditors, His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, were empowered to grant to unincorporated Companies and Associations certain Privileges in such last-mentioned Act set forth s 4 And whereas the aforesaid Provisions of the said recited Acts have not been found effectual for the Purposes thereby intended, and it is therefore expedient to repeal the same, and to make

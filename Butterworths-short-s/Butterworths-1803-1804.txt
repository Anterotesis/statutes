should no longer be kept, but that in lieu thereof Accounts should be laid before Parliament for such respective Periods as aforesaid of the Produce of such Duties, as far as the same can be ascertained:’ May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual

4 a Doubt had arisen whether, by the Laws then in force relating to Hackney Coaches, such Persons being licensed in the usual and general Form, were not compellable to do the ordinary Work of Hackney Coaches, and to carry Fares for Hire to any Parts or Places within the Cities of London or, or within

the Distance of Ten Miles thereof, which would be attended not only with great Inconvenience to the Inhabitants of such Towns and Places, but might also be a great lessening to His Majesty’s Revenue arising from Hackney Coaches; it was by the same recited Act declared, that, from and after the passing thereof, the said Commissioners for licensing and regulating Hackney Coaches, or any other Person or Persons having Authority to put any of the Laws in Execution concerning licensed Hackney Coachmen, their Renters or their Drivers,

4 should not be compelled or compellable to fine or punish any licensed Hackney Coachman, his Renter or Driver, for refusing to carry a Fare out of the ordinary Course of his Stage Work or Duty, who should regularly use and employ his Coach so licensed as a Stage Coach to and from any of the Towns or Places in the Neighbourhood of the said Cities of London and Westminster, and who should also, by painting in legible Characters on the Door of such Coach, or by a Board to be painted in legible Characters on the Door of such Coach,

4 plainly denote and distinguish the same to be a Stage Coach to and from any such Town or Place; any Thing in the said therein recited Act, or in any other Act relating to Hackne}^ Coaches,

4 by Persons letting Horses for the Purpose of travelling Post, and '

4 on Horses' let to Hire for travelling Post and by Time, and on Stage Coaches, and for granting other Duties lieu thereof, and also additional Duties on Horses let to Hire for travelling Post and by Time: And Whereas certain Duties in the same Act 4 specified in lieu of the Duties by the said recited Act repealed were thereby granted on Persons who should keep any Carriage in the said recited Act described, and among others the Sum of Five Shillings to be paid annually for a Licence for that Purpose, and also One Penny for every Mile such Carriage should travel; and such Duties were thereby placed under the Management of the Commissioners of Stamp Duties: And Whereas it was thereby further enacted and declared, that nothing therein contained should extend or be construed to extend to any Horses used in Hackney Coaches licensed pursuant to several Acts of Parliament made for that Purpose, where the Horses drawing such Hackney Coaches should be employed to go no greater Distance than Ten Miles from the Cities of London or.

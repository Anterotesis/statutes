WHEREAS by an Act passed in the last Session of Parliament, intituled An Act for the more effectual Relief of the destitute Poor in Ireland, it is amongst other things enacted, that it shall be lawful for the Poor Law Commissioners from Time to Time, by Order under their Seal, to unite such and so many Townlands as they may think fit to be an Union for the Relief of the destitute Poor, to declare any Union to be dissolved, or any Townland or Townlands to be added to or separated from such Union, to divide any Union into Electoral Divisions for the Election of Guardians, and to alter any Division from Time to Time as they may see fit, so nevertheless that in making or altering such Division no Townland shall be divided; and Provision is thereby further made for the Election of Guardians for every Electoral Division, for the Relief of the destitute Poor resident in such Electoral Divisions, and the charging of the Expence of such Relief thereon, and for making and levying Rates within every such Electoral Division: And whereas the Boundaries of many Townlands are not accurately known, and Places exist which are not Townlands, or not known as Townlands, and Doubts have been entertained whether the Provisions of the said Act can

Rate-payers to vote at Elections of Guardians according to Scale in recited Act.

be applied to such Townlands and Places; and it is expedient that such Doubts should be removed

Be it therefore declared and enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said recited Provisions, and all other Provisions of the said Act in any way relating to Townlands, shall be construed to extend and apply to every Place in Ireland, whether known as a Townland or not.

II. And be it enacted, That where in the Abstract of the Accounts of the Population taken by Authority of Parliament under an Act made in the Fifty-fifth Year of the Reign of King George the Third, and the several Acts amending the same, the Population of any City, Borough, or Town, and the Suburbs thereof, shall be stated to exceed Ten thousand, or where the Population of any other Place shall be so stated to exceed Ten thousand, and the Area of such Place shall not exceed Three Miles for every Ten thousand Persons, it shall be lawful for the said Commissioners to constitute such City, Borough, or Town, and the Suburbs thereof, or such other Place, or any Part or Parts thereof respectively, an Electoral Division for the Purposes of the said Act; and, for the Purpose of conducting the Election of Guardians, from Time to Time to divide such Electoral Division into such and so many Wards, and to alter the same as they may see fit, and to determine and alter the Number of Guardians to be elected by the Ratepayers in every such Ward.

III. And be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Commissioners, by Order under their Seal, to declare any Place not known to the said Commissioners as a Townland or Townlands to be, for the Purposes of the said Act, a Townland.

IV. And be it enacted, That in every Case in which the Boundaries of any Townland, or of any Place declared by the Commissioners to be a Townland, shall not be determined and made known to the Commissioners, it shall be lawful for the said Commissioners, by Order under their Seal, to declare, for the Purposes of the said Act, the Boundaries of such Townland or Place; and the Boundaries so declared shall accordingly be deemed and taken to be the Boundaries of such Townland or Place until the true Boundaries thereof shall be lawfully ascertained and made known to the Commissioners, and until they shall have revoked such Order.

V. And be it enacted, That in the Election of Guardians under the Provisions of the said Act every Rate-payer who, under the last Rate made in any Union, shall have paid or contributed or be liable to pay or contribute Rate in respect of Property in any Electoral Division shall have a Vote or Votes in the Election of Guardians in such Electoral Division, according to the Scale of Votes provided by the said Act.

VIII. And be it enacted and declared, That so often as any Purchase or Compensation Money shall, under the Provisions of the said Act, be payable into the Bank of Ireland in the Name and with the Privity of the Accountant General of the Court of Chancery, to be placed to his Account, and such Money shall not be placed to the Account of such Accountant General to the Credit of the Parties interested in the Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, under the Provisions in the said Act referred to, such Purchase or Compensation Money shall be placed to the Account of the said Accountant General " ex parte the Poor Law Commissioners."

IX. ' And whereas by the said Act it is provided, that if any ' Person or Persons shall find himself or themselves aggrieved by ' any Order or Conviction of any Justice or Justices, (except where 4 such Justice shall be an Assistant Barrister,) where such Person 4 or Persons shall be convicted in any Penalty or Penalties exceeding Five Pounds, or by any Rate made under this Act, or shall 4 have any material Objection to any Person or Persons being put 4 in or left out of such Rate, or to the Sum charged on any Person 4 therein, it shall be lawful for such Person or Persons to appeal 4 to any Sessions of the Peace to be held in the Presence of the 4 Assistant Barrister in and for the County in which such Rate or ' such Order shall have been made or Conviction taken place within ' Four Calendar Months next after the Cause of Complaint shall 4 have arisen, or if such Sessions shall be held before the Expira-' tion of One Calendar Month next after such Cause of Complaint,

' or where by reason of Owners of Land having purchased or

otherwise acquired such a beneficial Interest in the Tithes arising ' out of the same, for Life or Lives or for Years, as under the said 4 Provisions of the said first-recited Act requires that such Persons ' respectively should be dealt with and distinguished in such Award

as joint Owners with the Lessor of or the Person having the re-

LXXXIV. And Whereas in consequence of certain Exemptions from Toll expressly allowed by several Acts of Parliament for His Majesty's Forces on their March or on Duty, and for the Horses and Carriages attending them, Doubts have arisen whether in all Cases not 60 exempted, the Horses and Soldiers, and the Carriages and Horses belonging to His Majesty, or employed in His Service, and returning therefrom, may not be charged with the Payment of Tolls; Therefore, for obviating such Doubts, it is hereby enacted and declared, That all His Majesty's Officers and Soldiers, being in proper Staff or Regimental Unifonn, and their Horses, on Duty or on their March, and all Carriages and Horses belonging to His Majesty, or employed in His Service, and returning therefrom, or employed in His Service, when conveying the Officers, Soldiers, Servants, Wfomen, Children or other Persons of or belonging to His Majesty's Forces, or the Arms, Clothes, Accoutrements, Tents, Baggage and other Equipage of or belonging to His Majesty's Forces on their Marches, or any Ordnance or Barrack, or Commissariat or other Public Stores of or belonging to His Majesty or for the Use of His Majesty's Forces, or returning therefrom, were and are and shall he exempted from Payment of any Duties and Tolls otherwise dernandable by virtue of any Act of Parliament already made or hereafter to be made for Persons, Horses or Carriages, or any

XLV. And Whereas in consequence of certain Exemptions from Tolls expressly allowed by several Acts of Parliament for His Majesty's Forces on their March or on Duty, and for the Horses and Carriages attending them, Doubts have arisen whether in all Cases not so exempted the Officers and Marines, and the Carriages and Horses, Boats, Barges and other Vessels belonging to His Majesty, or employed in his Service, and returning therefrom, may not be charged with the Payment of

Tolls; Therefore, for obviating such Doubts, it is hereby enact- Officers and ed and declared, That all His Majesty's Officers, and Marines, being in proper Uniform, and their Horses, on Duty or on their "

Mareh, and all Carriages, and Horses belonging to His Majesty, His Majesty's or employed in His Service, and returning therefrom, and also Service, ex-all Boats, Barges and other Vessels belonging to His Majesty, or empted from employed in His Service, when conveying the Officers, Marines, £aj7nent Servants, Women, Children or other Persons of or belonging to 0 '

An Act for the Relief in certain Cases, of the Incumbents of Ecclesiastical Livings or Benefices mortgaged for building, rebuilding, repairing or purchasing Houses and other necessary Buildings and Tenements for such Benefices.

[21st June 1824.]

WHEREAS under and by virtue of an Act of Parliament 4 u made in the Seventeenth Year of the Reign of His 17 G. 3. c. 53. Majesty King George the Third, intituled An Act to promote the Residence of the Parochial Clergy^ by making Provision for the more speedy and effectual building, rebuilding, repairing or purchasing Houses and other necessary Buildings and Tenements for the Use of their Benefices; and an other Act made in the Twenty first Year of His said Majesty's Reign, to explain and si G.s. c. 66. 4 amend the said Act; many Mortgages of Ecclesiastical Livings and Benefices have been made, and are still remaining in force,

as Securities for Monies borrowed for building, rebuilding, repairing or purchasing Houses and other necessary Buildings and Tenements for such Benefices; and in most Cases the Sums of Money borrowed on such Mortgages have been to the full Amount authorized by the said Acts, that is to say, Two Years '

4 Net Income and Produce of the said respective Livings or Benefices, estimated at or previous to the Execution of such several Mortgages in the Manner by the said Acts directed;

and the Incumbents of the said respective Livings or Benefices are liable, according to the Directions of the said Acts, to pay Five Pounds per Centum per Annum of the Principal Mo-.

nies so borrowed; or in case such Incumbents shall not reside Twenty Weeks in each Year upon such Livings or Benefices,

then instead of Five Pounds per Cent. to pay Ten Pounds per Annum per Centum of the said Principal Monies, over and above the Interest arising upon such Mortgages, until the whole Principal Monies and Interest shall be fully paid and discharged: Ajid Whereas great Reduction has taken place in the Income and Produce of many Livings or Benefices mortgaged by virtue of the said Acts since the respective Mortgages thereof were made, whereby it happens that the Yearly Payments in Discharge of the Monies borrowed on such Mortgages, which the Incumbents of the said Livings or Benefices are liable to pay, amount to a larger Proportion of the present Income and Produce thereof than it was contemplated or intended that they should be liable to pay according to the Directions of the qaid Acts; and it is just and expedient that such Provision be made for the Relief of Incumbents of Livings or Benefices already mortgaged by virtue of the said Acts as hereinafter is expressed:' Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parlia-

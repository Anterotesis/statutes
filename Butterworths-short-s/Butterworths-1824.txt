An Act for the Relief in certain Cases, of the Incumbents of Ecclesiastical Livings or Benefices mortgaged for building, rebuilding, repairing or purchasing Houses and other necessary Buildings and Tenements for such Benefices.

[21st June 1824.]

WHEREAS under and by virtue of an Act of Parliament 4 u made in the Seventeenth Year of the Reign of His 17G.3. c.53. 4 Majesty King George the Third, intituled An Act to promote the Residence of the Parochial Clergy^ by making Provision for the more speedy and effectual building, rebuilding, repairing or purchasing Houses and other necessary Buildings and Tenements for the Use of their Benefices; and an other Act made in the Twenty first Year of His said Majesty's Reign, to explain and si G.s. c.66. 4 amend the said Act; many Mortgages of Ecclesiastical Livings and Benefices have been made, and are still remaining in force,

4 as Securities for Monies borrowed for building, rebuilding, repairing or purchasing Houses and other necessary Buildings and Tenements for such Benefices; and in most Cases the Sums of Money borrowed on such Mortgages have been to the full Amount authorized by the said Acts, that is to say, Two Years '

4 Net Income and Produce of the said respective Livings or Benefices, estimated at or previous to the Execution of such several Mortgages in the Manner by the said Acts directed;

and the Incumbents of the said respective Livings or Benefices are liable, according to the Directions of the said Acts, to

4 pay Five Pounds per Centum per Annum of the Principal Mo-.

4 nies so borrowed; or in case such Incumbents shall not reside Twenty Weeks in each Year upon such Livings or Benefices,

4 then instead of Five Pounds per Cent. to pay Ten Pounds per Annum per Centum of the said Principal Monies, over and above the Interest arising upon such Mortgages, until the whole Principal Monies and Interest shall be fully paid and discharged: Ajid Whereas great Reduction has taken place in the Income and Produce of many Livings or Benefices mortgaged by virtue of the said Acts since the respective Mortgages thereof were made, whereby it happens that the Yearly Payments in Discharge of the Monies borrowed on such Mortgages, which the Incumbents of the said Livings or Benefices are liable to pay, amount to a larger Proportion of the present Income and Produce thereof than it was contemplated or intended that they should be liable to pay according to the Directions of the qaid Acts; and it is just and expedient that such Provision be made for the Relief of Incumbents of Livings or Benefices already mortgaged by virtue of the.said Acts as hereinafter is expressed:' Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parlia-

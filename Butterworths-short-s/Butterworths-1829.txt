WHEREAS by an Act passed in the Parliament of the United Kingdom in the Forty-third Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third,

[43 G. 3. c. 46.]

intituled An Act for the more effectual Prevention of frivolous and vexatious Arrests and Suits, and to authorize the levying of Poundage upon Executions in certain Cases, it was amongst other Things enacted, that from and after the First Day of June One thousand eight hundred and three no Person should be arrested or held to Special Bail upon any Process issuing out of any Court within those Parts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland called England and Ireland, for a Cause of Action not originally amounting to such Sum for which such Person was by the Laws then in being

liable to be arrested and held to Bail, over and above and exclusive of any Costs, Charges, and Expences that might have been incurred, recovered, or become chargeable in or about the suing for or recovering the same or any Part thereof: And Whereas by an Act passed in the same Year,

[43 G.3. c.53.]

intituled An Act to render the Process of His Majesty's Courts of King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer, in Personal Actions in Ireland, more beneficial, and also to prevent frivolous and vexatious Arrests; and to repeal so much of an Act passed in the Parliament of Ireland in the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Years of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled An Act for enlarging the Time for Trials by Nisi Prius in the City and County of Dublin, and for making the Process of the Court of Exchequer more effectual, as relates to compelling the Appearance of Defendants in Personal Actions, it is amongst other Things enacted, that from and after the First Day of Michaelmas Term in the Year One thousand eight hundred and three no Person shall be held to Special Bail upon any Process issuing out of His Majesty's Court of King's Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer, in that Part of the said United Kingdom called Ireland, where the Cause of Action shall not amount to the Sum of Ten Pounds or upwards, nor out of any inferior Court where the Cause of Action shall not amount to the Sum of Forty Shillings or upwards; and that in all Cases where the Cause of Action shall not amount to the Sum of Ten Pounds or upwards in any of the said superior Courts, or to Forty Shillings or upwards in any such inferior Courts (and the Plaintiff or Plaintiffs shall proceed by Way of Process against the Person), he, she, or they shall not arrest or cause to be arrested the Body of the Defendant or Defendants, but shall serve him, her, or them personally with a Copy of the Process; and if such Defendant or Defendants shall not appear at the Return of the Process, or within Eight Days after such Return, in such Case it shall and may be lawful for the Plaintiff or Plaintiffs, upon Affidavit being made and filed in the proper Court, of the personal Service of such Process as aforesaid (which said Affidavit shall be filed gratis), to enter a Common Appearance or file Common Bail for the Defendant or Defendants, and to proceed thereon as if such Defendant or Defendants had entered his, her, or their Appearance, or filed Common Bail; any Law or Usage to the contrary notwithstanding: And Whereas it is expedient to extend and render more effectual the Provisions of the said recited Acts; Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same,

[No Person to be held to Bail where Cause of Action does not amount to 20l.]

That from and after the First Day of August One thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine no Person shall be held to Special Bail upon any Process issuing out of any Court in Ireland, where the Cause of Action shall not have originally amounted to the Sum of Twenty Pounds or upwards, over and above and exclusive of any Costs, Charges, and Expences that may have been incurred, recovered, or become chargeable in or about the suing for or recovering the same or any Part thereof? and that in all Cases where the Cause of Action shall not amount

who have been arrested to deposit or pay into the Court in which the Writ shall be returnable the Sum indorsed upon the Writ, together with an additional Sum as a Security for Costs, to abide the Event of the Suit, instead of putting in and perfecting Bail in the said Action; Be it therefore enacted, That in all Cases in which any Defendant shall have been discharged from Arrest, upon making such Deposit as is required by the said last-mentioned Act, and the Sum so deposited shall have been paid into Court, it shall be lawful for such Defendant, instead of putting in and perfecting Special Bail in the Action, according to the Course and Practice of the Court, to allow the Sum so deposited with the Sheriff and by him paid into Court as aforesaid, together with the additional Sum of Ten Pounds to be paid into Court by such Defendant as a further Security for the Costs of the Action, to remain in the Court to abide the Event of the Suit;

thereupon the said Defendant may and he is hereby required to enter a Common Appearance or file Common Bail in the Action within such Time as he would have been required to have put in and perfected Special Bail in the Action, according to the Course of the said Court, or, in Default thereof, the Plaintiff in the Action is hereby empowered to enter such Common Appearance or file Common Bail for the said Defendant, and the Cause may proceed as if the Defendant had put in and perfected Special Bail; and in case Judgment in the said Action shall be given for the Plaintiff, be shall be entitled, by Order of the Court, upon Motion made for that Purpose, to receive the said Money so remaining in or so deposited or paid into the Court as aforesaid, or so much thereof as will be sufficient to satisfy the Sum recovered by the Judgment, and the Costs of the Application; and if Judgment be given in the said Action for the Defendant, or the Plaintiff discontinue his Suit, or be otherwise barred, or in case the Sum deposited and paid into Court be more than sufficient to satisfy the Plaintiff, the said Money so deposited or paid into Court, or so much thereof as shall remain, shall, by Order of the Court, upon Motion to be made for that Purpose, be repaid to such Defendant.

[Defendant may receive such Deposit and Payment out of Court upon perfecting Special Bail.]

intituled An Act for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors in Ireland, to continue in force until the First Day of August One thousand eight hundred and twenty-six, and thenceforth until the End of the then next Session of Parliament, and no longer; and which Act was amended by an Act passed in the Third Year of His present Majesty's Reign;

[3 G. 4. c. 124. continued.]

and by an Act made in the Seventh and Eighth Years of His present Majesty's Reign both the said Acts were continued, and are in Force until the End of this present Session of Parliament: and it is expedient that the said Acts should be further continued and amended; Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said Two first-recited Acts shall be and the said Acts are hereby continued, and shall remain in Force from the passing of this Act until the End of the Session of Parliament next ensuing this present Session, as amended by this Act.

directed to all or any of the Coroners of the said County, who should and might execute the same without any further Direction or Regard to the said Sheriffs, any former Law, Statute, or Usage to the contrary notwithstanding; and that thereupon the said Coroner or Coroners should be authorized and empowered to

take Bail for the Appearance of such Person or Persons taken by him or them on Mesne Process, as the Sheriff might have ' done, and should be liable to an Action in case of any Escape of any Person in his or their Custody on such Mesne Process or Execution, as the Sheriff should have been if the said Writ had been executed by him, and that the said Coroner or Coroners should and might take such Fees, and no other or more, 4 for Execution of the said several Writs, than as was by the said Act appointed; and in case the said Coroner or Coroners should commit any Person or Persons so taken by them to the County Gaol, the Gaoler was thereby directed and required to receive and detain them:

And Whereas by an Act passed in the Third Year of His present Majesty's Reign, intituled An Act to regulate the Qualifications of Persons holding the Office of Coroner in Ireland, it was amongst other Things enacted, that no Writ or Process in any Civil Suit or Action should in any Case be awarded to any Coroner in Ireland, except in Cases in which the Sheriff to whom such Process should be awarded should be interested in the Suit, or should be of Kindred either to the Plaintiff or Defendant; by which said last-mentioned Enactment the said Provisions of the said Act of Queen Ann were repealed: And Whereas such Repeal has been found to be of mischievous Consequence; Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That so much of the said Act of the Third Year of His present Majesty as is hereinbefore recited shall be and the same is hereby repealed, and that the said Provisions of the said Act of Queen Ann shall be and the same are hereby revived and re-enacted.

II. And Whereas by the said Act passed in the Third Year of the Reign of His present Majesty it was also enacted, that no Person should be capable of being elected or chosen to the Office of Coroner for any County in Ireland who should not have an Estate of the Value therein mentioned, but no Provision is by the said Act made with respect to the Qualification of Persons electing Coroners of Counties: And Whereas it has been found that such Elections have, in consequence of the' 4 Number of Persons claiming a Right to vote thereat, been in some Instances much protracted, to the great Inconvenience of Sheri fife holding such Elections, and to the Interruption of their other Duties, and to the Danger of the public Peace; Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the Commencement of this* Act no Person shall be permitted to vote at any Election for the Office of Coroner in any County in Ireland, unless such Person shall be, at - the Time when he claims so to vote, qualified by Law to vote at an Election for a Knight of the Shire to serve in Parliament for such County; of which Qualification the Certificate by Law

prescribed of their Registry of the Freehold of such Person shall be sufficient Evidence.

III. And Whereas at Inquests held by Coroners upon the 1 Bodies of deceased Persons great Difficulty exists in procuring the Attendance of Witnesses duly qualified to give Evidence as to the Cause of the Death of such Persons, by reason of the ' Want of any Power to remunerate such Witnesses for their Trouble and Loss of Time; ' Be it enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for any Coroner, before whom any Physician, Surgeon, Apothecary, Chemist, or other Person practising Medicine or Surgery, shall, in pursuance of a Summons from such Coroner, attend and be examined relative to the Death of any deceased Person, to grant to such Witness an Order, signed by such Coroner, upon the Treasurer of the County or County of a City within which such Inquest shall be held, for such Sum, not exceeding Five Pounds, as to such Coroner shall seem fit; and the Treasurer upon whom such Order shall be given shall pay the same to the Person presenting it; and the Amount of every such Payment shall be raised off the County or County of the City by the Grand Jury, in like Manner as other Sums authorized to be presented and levied by such Grand Jury.

IV. And be it enacted, That no Election for the Office of Coroner shall continue longer than Ten Days from the Day of the Delivery of the Writ for holding such Election.

VI. And Whereas by the Laws now in Force certain Articles subject to an Inland Duty of Excise are required to be stamped, 4 to denote the Payment of such Duty; and to prevent Fraud in the Evasion of such Duty, it is expedient that Foreign Articles of a similar Description, when imported into the United Kingdom, should be stamped with such Mark or Stamp as the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs may deem necessary, in order to distinguish the Foreign from the British Article; ' Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, it shall and may be lawful for the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs, and they are hereby authorized, after any Goods have been entered at the Custom House, and before the same shall be discharged by the Officers and delivered into the Custody of the

His Majesty reserving Rents, several Denominations or Parcels of Lana are granted by the same Grant, and in some of such Grants the several Proportions of Rent for the several Denotninations or Parcels of Land, or for some of them, are set forth,

Â« and in others of such Grants the several Proportions of Rent for ' the several Denominations or Parcels of Land are not set forth,

but the Court of Exchequer in Ireland, in all Cases where Lands or Hereditaments comprized in One Grant from the Crown and jqintly liable to One Rent have become subdivided amongst ' several Proprietors, exercises a Jurisdiction of apportioning such

Rent as between the several Proprietors of the Lands and Hereditaments subject thereto, with a Reservation of the Right of the

Crown: And Whereas for the Encouragement of Persons to purchase, under the Provisions of this Act, the Rents charged on

their Lands and Hereditaments, it will be desirable that any Person seised of or interested in any Lands or Hereditaments liable, jointly with other Lands or Hereditaments, to a Gross ' Rent, which shall have been so apportioned by the original ' Grant, or by the Court of Exchequer, should be enabled* by the ' Purchase of that Proportion of the Gross Rent which by such

Apportionment shall have been made specifically payable in respect of their Lands and Hereditaments, entirely to exonerate

such their Lands and Hereditaments, as well, from the Portion of Rent so specifically made payable in respect thereof, as also from 4. all Liability in respect of the other Portions of the Gross Rent charged on the Lands comprized in the same Grant Be it therefore further enacted, That whenever any Person or Persons, or Body or Bodies Politic, Corporate, or Collegiate, shall purchase under this Act, in order that the same may become extinguished, any Portion of any Rent which shall have been so apportioned, either by the original Grant or by the Court of Exchequer as aforesaid, then and in every such Case the Lands and Hereditaments upon which the Portion of Rent so purchased shall have been so specifically charged shall be and the same are hereby exonerated and discharged, not only from the Portion of Rent so purchased, but also of and from all other Portions of the Rent reserved by the same Grant; any Law, Custom, or Usage to the contrary thereof in anywise notwithstanding: Provided nevertheless, that any such Exoneration and Discharge shall not prejudice or affect the Right of the Crown to recover against the Remainder of the Lands and Hereditaments comprized in the same Grant the remaining Portions of the Rent thereby reserved.

XXXIX. And be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful for any Body Politic, Corporate, or Collegiate, having any Estate or Interest m any Hereditaments which may be subject to any Kent or Rents, or any Manorial, Forestal, or other Rights hereby

XLI. ' And Whereas Cases may occur in which it may be c desirable that Rents, or Manorial, Forestal, or other Rights hereby authorized to be sold, should be purchased, in order that

the same may become extinguished; but by reason of the Here-

ditaments subject thereto not being vested in any Person for an

Estate of Fee Simple in Possession, or by reason of some In-

capacity in the Owner thereof, special Provisions may be expedient for facilitating such Purchases; ' Be it therefore enacted. That it shall be lawful for any Tenant for Life or Lives, Tenant in Tail or Tenant for any determinable Fee, of any Hereditaments upon which any Rent or Rents hereby authorized to be sold may be charged, or which may be subject to any Manorial, Forestal, or other Rights hereby authorized to be sold, and for the Committee or Committees of any Lunatic, the Guardian or Guardians of any Infant, or the Trustee or Trustees for any Feme Covert, or other Person under any Incapacity, or the Husband of any Feme Covert, which Lunatic, Infant, Feme Covert, or other incapacitated Person shall be Owner of or beneficially interested in any such Hereditaments as aforesaid for Life, in Tail or in Fee, either absolutely or determinable, by any Deed or Deeds, or Instrument

the said Parish of Oran was conveniently situated for the Parishioners of the said Parishes to repair unto, were the same rebuilt, it was enacted, that it should and might be lawful to and for the Bishop of the said Diocess, with the Approbation of the ' Archbishop of the Province, and the Consent of the respective ' Patrons, Incumbents, and the major Part of the Inhabitants of the said Parishes, to order the Church to be rebuilt at Oran in the

said Parish of Oran, and to unite the said Parishes of Oran and Drumtemple; and that the said Parishes so united should be called by the Name of the Parish of Oran; and that the Inhabit-

ants of the said United Parish should from Time to Time be ' liable to and chargeable with building and keeping in Repair the said Church of Oran, which was for ever to be deemed and

taken to be One Parish to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever:

* And Whereas after the passing of the said Act the said Parishes of Oran and Drumtemple were episcopally united with Three other Parishes, namely, the Parish of Donamon, the Parish of Kilcrotvan, and the Parish of BattynakUl, all in the said Diocess of Elpkin, which Union still subsists: And Whereas, in conse *

quence of the great Extent of the said Union, it may be expeclient hereafter to disunite the said Parishes, or to divide the said Union into Two Parts, One to consist of the said Parishes of Oran and Drumtemple, and the other to consist of the said Parishes of Donamon, Kilcrotvan, and Ballynakill: And Whereas no Church has since the passing of the said Act been built or rebuilt, pur-

suant thereto, in the said Parishes thereby united, or either of them; and foe said Union of the said Five Parishes now contains only One Church, which m in the said Parish of Donamon, and is extremely remote from other Parts of the said Union: And Whereas the Trustees and Commissioners of the First Fruits of the several Benefices in Ireland have granted the Sum of Nine

hundred Pounds, late Irish Currency, for building a Church in the said Parish of Drumterriple, being Part of the Union created by the said Act; and a Site for such new Church has been

selected in the Village of Ballymoe in the said Parish, as being 4 more eligible than the Site of Oran, mentioned in the said Act;

but such new Church cannot, by reason of* the said Act, -be

erected at any other Place in the said Union of Oran and Drumtemple than Oran aforesaid, which has on various Accounts become unfit for that Purpose; ' Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, '

Recited Act in That so much of the said Act passed in the Ninth Year of the Part repealed. Reign of Queen Anne as is herein-before recited shall be and the same is hereby repealed.

Purposes only, or any of them, should be deemed as Public and General Acts in all Courts and by all Persons, and that no Fee* 4 should be paid or taken by any Person or Persons for passing any such Act of Parliament: And Whereas it is expedient that a like Provision should be made in this Case; Be it therefore enacted* That this present Act shall be deemed a Public and General Act* and shall be judicially taken notice of as such in all Courts, and by all Judges, Justices, and others, without being specially pleaded* and that no Fees shall be paid or taken by any Person for passing the same.

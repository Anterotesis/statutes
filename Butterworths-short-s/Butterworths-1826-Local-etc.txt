contract for, hold or possess under or by virtue or for the Pur* 4 poses of the said Act, and should for those Purposes be a Joint Stock Company by the Name and Description of The Irish Company for promoting Manufactures and it was by the said Act further enacted, that the Sum subscribed for, or such Part

A.D. 1833. 3° & 4° GULIELMI IV. c.4. 3

Persons, who have, by their Numbers and Violence, created such general Alarm and Intimidation as materially to impede the due Course of public Justice, and to frustrate the ordinary Modes of Criminal Prosecution: And whereas divers Meetings and Assemblies, inconsistent with the public Peace and Safety, and with the Exercise of regular Government, have for some Time past been held in Ireland: And whereas the Laws now in force in that Part of the United Kingdom have been found inadequate to the prompt and effectual Suppression of the said Mischiefs, and the Interposition of Parliament is necessary for the Purpose of checking the further Progress of the same; be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same,

XXVI. And whereas great Inconvenience has arisen from the driving of Stage Carriages, and from the driving of Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, and other Animals, in the Streets and Highways c of the Metropolis during the Hours of Divine Service, and it is expedient that Regulations should be made for preventing such Interruption and Annoyance; ' be it therefore enacted, That on the Application of the Minister or Churchwardens of any Church, Chapel, or other Place of public Worship to the Court of Aldermen of the City of London, if the same shall be situated within the City of London or the Liberties thereof, or to any Two of the Justices of the said Public Office in Bow Street, or to any Two of the Justices appointed to attend at any of the said Police Offices which shall be in the Vicinity of such Church or Chapel or Place of public Worship, if the same shall be situated within the Limits and Parishes aforesaid, it shall be lawful for the Court of Aldermen, or for such Two Justices, as the Case may be, to make Rules or Orders for regulating the Route and Conduct of Persons who shall drive any Stage Carriage, or who shall drive any Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, or other Animals within such Parish or Place, during the Hours of Divine Service on Sunday, Christmas Day, Good Friday, or any Day appointed for a Public Fast or Thanksgiving, and to annex reasonable Penalties for the Breach of such Rules or Orders, not exceeding Forty Shillings with Costs, if ordered, for any such Offence, provided the same be not repugnant to the Laws of the Realm, and from Time to Time to alter and amend the same if necessary; and every Breach of any such Rule or Order shall be deemed a separate Offence; and any Person who shall offend against any such Rule or Order shall, on Conviction thereof before any Justice of the Peace, forfeit and pay such Penalty as shall be adjudged, and, in default of Payment within such Time as such Justice at the Time of Conviction shall appoint, shall be liable to be imprisoned for any Term not exceeding One Month; and any Person committing any Offence against any such Rule or Order may be immediately apprehended, without any Warrant, by any Constable who shall see such Offence committed, and be conveyed before a Justice of the Peace, to be dealt with as herein-before is mentioned; and any Justice of the Peace, on Complaint made to him that any such Offence hath been committed within his Jurisdiction, may issue his Warrant for the Apprehension of any such Offender: Provided always, that when any such Rules or Orders shall have been made by the Court of Aldermen of the City of London, or by any Two Justices as herein-before is mentioned, the same shall be printed, and affixed on the Church, Chapel, or Place of public Worship to which the same shall refer, and in the most conspicuous Places leading to and contiguous thereto, and elsewhere, as the said Court of Aldermen or the said Justices shall direct.

such Stage Carriage shall be compelled to make daring the Hours of Divine Service by virtue of any Order or Rules made by the Court of Aldermen, or by Two Justices of the Peace, as herein-before is mentioned.

XXVIII. And whereas an Act passed in the Twenty-first Year of the Reign of King George the Third, intituled An Act to prevent the Mischiefs that arise from driving Cattle within the Cities of London and Westminster, and Liberties thereof and 1 Bills of Mortality, has been found ineffectual for the Prevention of such Mischiefs, and it is expedient to extend the Powers and enlarge the Limits of the said Act be it therefore enacted.

XXIX. And whereas divers Places in and about the Metropolis are kept and used for the Purpose of fighting or baiting of Bears or other Animals, at which Places idle and disorderly Persons commonly assemble, to the Interruption of good Order and the Danger of the public Peace; be it therefore enacted, That any Person who shall, within Five Miles of Temple Bar, keep or use, or shall act in the Management or conducting of any Premises or Place whatsoever for the Purpose of fighting or baiting of Bears, Cock-fighting, baiting or fighting of Badgers or other Animals, shall, on Conviction thereof before any One Justice of the Peace, forfeit any Sum not exceeding Five Pounds, and in default of immediate Payment shall be liable to be imprisoned and kept to hard Labour for any Time not exceeding Two Months, unless the said Penalty shall be sooner paid.

made Coffee or Tea, or other Liquors, or any Refreshments or ' any Liquors not subject to any Duties of Customs or Excise,

are consumed, for the Purpose of devising or planning such Felonies or other Offences; and although their evil Purposes are sufficiently manifest, the Power of His Majesty's Justices ' of the Peace to demand of them Sureties for their good Beha- viour hath not been of sufficient Effect to prevent them from

carrying their evil Purposes into execution; ' be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful for any Constable, Headborough, Patrol, Watchman, or other Person, to apprehend every such suspected Person or reputed Thief, and convey him or her before any Justice of the Peace; and if it shall appear before the said Justice, upon the Oath of One or more credible Witness or Witnesses, that such Person is a suspected Person or reputed Thief, and such Person shall not be able to give a satisfactory Account of himself or herself, and of his or her Way of Living, and it shall also appear to the Satisfaction of the said Justice that there is just Ground to believe that such Person was in or on any such Place as aforesaid with such Intent or for such Purpose as aforesaid, every such Person shall be deemed a Rogue and Vagabond within the Intent and Meaning of the Statute made in the Fifth Year of His late Majesty King George the Fourth, intituled An Act for the Punishment of idle and disorderly Persons, and Rogues and Vagabonds, in tl*at Part of Great Britain called England, and upon Conviction shall be liable to the Punishment indicted by the said Act on any Person convicted as a Rogue and Vagabond; and in case any Person so convicted shall afterwards be guilty of the like Offence he shall be deemed to be an incorrigible Rogue within the Intent and Meaning of the said Statute, and shall be liable to be proceeded against as such in manner directed by the said Statute.

XXIV. And be it further enacted, That the said Court or Judge shall and may, if they or he think fit, in all such Cases of Variance, instead of causing the Record or Document to be amended as aforesaid, direct the Jury to find the Fact or Facts according to the Evidence, and thereupon such Finding shall be stated on such Record or Document, and, notwithstanding the Finding on the Issue joined, the said Court or the Court from which the Record has issued shall, if they shall think the said Variance immaterial to the Merits of the Case, and the Misstatement such as could not have prejudiced the opposite Party in the Conduct of the Action or Defence, give Judgment according to the very Right and Justice of the Case.

XXVI. And in order to render the Rejection of Witnesses on the Ground of Interest less frequent, be it further enacted, Thai if any Witness shall be objected to as incompetent on the Ground that the Verdict or Judgment in the Action on which it shall be. proposed to examine him would be admissible in Evidence for or. against him, such Witness shall nevertheless be examined, but in that Case a Verdict or Judgment in that Action in favour of the Party on whose Behalf he shall have been examined shall not be admissible in Evidence for him or any one claiming under him, nor shall a Verdict or Judgment against the Party on whose Behalf he shall have been examined be admissible in Evidence against him or any one claiming under him.

XXIX. And be it further enacted, That the Jury on the Trial of any Issue, or on any Inquisition of Damages, may, if they shall think fit, give Damages in the Nature of Interest, over and above the Value of the Goods at the Time of the Conversion or Seizure, in all Actions of Trover or Trespass^de bonis asportatis, and over and above the Money recoverable in all Actions on Policies of Assurance made after the passing of this Act.

4 Fourth, To the same Distance from the Coasts of the Island of Porto Rico;

4 Fifth, To the same Distance from the Coasts of Brazil:

4 It was however understood, that a suspected Vessel,

1 descried and begun to be chased by the Cruizers, while within the said Space of Twenty Leagues, might be searched by them beyond those Limits, if, without ever having lost sight of her, they should only succeed in coming up with her at a greater Distance from the Coast:

And whereas by the Second Article it was agreed, that the Right of searching Merchant Vessels of either of the Two Nations in the Waters herein-before mentioned should be exercised only by Ships of War whose Commanders should have the Rank of Captain, or at least that of Lieutenant in the Navy: And whereas by the Third Article it was agreed, that the Number of Ships to be invested with the said Right should be fixed each Year by a special Agreement, that the Number for each Nation need not be the same, but that in no Case should the Number of the Cruizers of the one Nation be more than Double the Number of the Cruizers of the other; And whereas by the Fourth Article it was agreed, that the Names of the Ships and of their Commanders should be communicated by each of the contracting Governments to the other, and Information should be reciprocally given of all Changes which might take place in the Cruizers:

And whereas by the Fifth Article it was agreed, that Instructions should be drawn up and agreed upon in common by the Two Governments for the Cruizers of both Nations, which Cruizers should afford to each other mutual Assistance in all Circumstances in which it might be useful that they should act in concert; and that the Ships of War authorized to exercise the reciprocal Right of Search should be furnished with a special Authority from each of the Two Governments: And whereas by the Sixth Article it was agreed, that whenever a Cruizer should have chased and overtaken a Merchant Vessel, as liable to Suspicion the Commanding Officer, before he should proceed to the Search, should exhibit to the Captain of the Merchant Vessel the special Orders which confer upon him, by Exception, the Right to visit her; and in case he should ascertain the Ship's 4 Papers to be regular, and her Proceedings lawful, he should certify upon the Xog Book of the Vessel that the Search took place only in virtue of the said Orders; and that, these Formalities having been completed, the Vessel should be at liberty to continue her Course: And whereas by the Seventh Article it was agreed, that the Vessels captured for being engaged in the Slave Trade, or as being suspected of being fitted out for that infamous Traffic, should, together with their Crews, be delivered over, without Delay, to the Jurisdiction of the Nation to which they should belong; and it was furthermore distinctly understood, 4 that they should only be judged according to the Laws in force in their respective Countries: And whereas by the Eighth Article it was agreed, that in no Case should the Right of mutual Search be exercised upon the Ships of War of either Nation; that the Two

4 Governments should agree on a particular Signal with which those

Cruizers only should be furnished which were invested with that Right, and which Signal should not be made known to any other f Ship not employed upon that Service; and by the Ninth Article the High Contracting Parties to the said Treaty agreed to invite

the other Maritime Powers to accede to it within as short a Period

, as possible; and by the Tenth Article it was agreed, that the then present Convention should be ratified, and the Ratifications of it

should be exchanged within One Month, or sooner, if it were possible: And whereas the said Convention was ratified by and between His Majesty and His Majesty the King of the French ^'-W^petetively, and such Ratifications were exchanged on the

French for the more effectual Suppression of the Traffic in Slaves,

and signed at Paris on the Twenty-second Day of March in the

Year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and thirty-three: '* And whereas by the First Article of the said Supplementary Convention it was agreed, that whenever a Merchant Vessel navigating under the Flag of one of the said Two Nations should have been detained by the Cruizers of the other, duly authorised to that effect, conformably to the Provisions of the f said Convention of the Thirtieth Day of November in the Year One thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, such Merchant

Vessel, and al9o her Master, her Crew, her Cargo, and the Slaves who might be on board, should be carried to such Places as should have been appointed by the contracting Parties respectively, in order that Proceedings might be there 4itatitated respecting them, agreeably to the Laws of each Country, and that they should be delivered over to the Authorities

appointed for that Purpose by the respective Governments; and that when the Commander of the Cruizer should not think proper f to take upon himself the carrying in and delivering up the detained

Vessel, he should not entrust that Duty to an Officer below the a Rank of Lieutenant in the Navy: And whereas by the Second 4flArcfcfo of the said Supplementary Convention it was agreed, that fo^beOutafers of the Two Nations authorized to exercise the Right 4 4f Visit and Detention, in execution of the Convention of the Thirtieth Day of November One thousand eight hundred and thirty-

Whenever a Merchant Vessel of either of the Two Nations shall be visited by a Cruizer of the other, the Officer commanding the Cruizer shall exhibit to the Master of such Vessel the special Orders which confer upon him the exceptional Right of Visit, and shall deliver to him a 4 Certificate signed by him, specifying his Rank in the Navy of his Country, with the Name of the Ship which he commantis, and declaring that the only Object of such Visit is to ascertain whether the Vessel is engaged in the Slave

Trade, or is fitted out for the Purposes of such Traffic.

When the Visit is made by another Officer of the Cruizer than her Commander, this Officer shall not be under the Rank of Lieutenant in the Nav}r, and in this Case such Officer shall exhibit to the Master of the Merchant Vessel 4 a Copy of the special Orders above mentioned, signed by the Commander of the Cruizer, and shall likewise deliver to him a Certificate signed by him, specifying the Rank which he holds in the Navy, the Name of the Commander under whose Orders he is acting, and of the Cruizer to which he belongs, and the Object of his Visit, as hereinbefore recited. If it shall be ascertained by the Visit that the Ship's Papers are regular, and her Proceedings lawful, 4 the Officer shall certify upon the Log Book of the Vessel that the Visit took place only in virtue of the special Orders above mentioned; and the Vessel shall be permitted to continue her Course:

4 Secondly.

[28th August 1833.]

WHEREAS divers Persons are holden in Slavery within divers of His Majesty's Colonies, and it is just and expedient that all such Persons should be manumitted and set free, and that a reasonable Compensation should be made to the Persons hitherto entitled to the Services of such Slaves for the Loss which they will incur by being deprived of their Right to such Services: And whereas it is also expedient that Provision should be made for promoting the Industry and securing the good Conduct of the Persons so to be manumitted, for a limited Period after such their Manumission: And whereas it is necessary that the Laws now in force in the said several Colonies should forthwith be adapted to the new State and Relations of Society therein which will follow upon such general Manumission as aforesaid of the said Slaves; and that, in order to afford the necessary Time for such Adaptation of the said Laws, a short Interval should elapse before such Manumission should take effect; be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same,

[All Persons who on the 1st August 1834 shall have been registered as Slaves, and be Six Years old or upwards, shall become apprenticed Labourers.]

That from and after the First Day of August One thousand eight hundred and thirty-four all Persons who in conformity with the Laws now in force in the said Colonies respectively shall on or before the First Day of August One thousand eight hundred and thirty-four have been duly registered as Slaves in any such Colony, and who on the said First Day of August One thousand eight hundred and thirty-four shall be actually within any such Colony, and who shall by such Registries appear to be on the said First Day of August One thousand eight hundred and thirty-four of the full Age of Six Years or upwards, shall by force and virtue of this Act, and without the previous Execution of any Indenture of Apprenticeship, or other Deed or Instrument for that Purpose, become and be apprenticed Labourers; provided that, for the Purposes aforesaid, every Slave engaged in his ordinary Occupation on the Seas shall be deemed and taken to be within the Colony to which such Slave shall belong.

[Who entitled to Services of the Slave as an apprenticed Labourer.]

II. And be it further enacted, That during the Continuance of the Apprenticeship of any such apprenticed Labourer such Person or Persons shall be entitled to the Services of such apprenticed Labourer as would for the Time being have been entitled to his or her Services as a Slave if this Act had not been made.

[Slaves brought into the United Kingdom with Consent of Possessors, free.]

III. Provided also, and be it further enacted, That all Slaves who may at any Time previous to the passing of this Act have been brought with the Consent of their Possessors, and all apprenticed Labourers who may hereafter with the like Consent be brought, into any Part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,

A.D. 1833. 3° & 4° GULIELMI IV. C.73. 667

[Apprenticed Labourers to be divided into Three Classes, viz. praedial attached, praedial unattached, and non-praedial.]

IV. And whereas it is expedient that all such apprenticed Labourers should, for the Purposes herein-after mentioned, be divided into Three distinct Classes, the First of such Classes consisting of praedial apprenticed Labourers attached to the Soil, and comprising all Persons who in their State of Slavery were usually employed in Agriculture, or in the Manufacture of Colonial Produce or otherwise, upon Lands belonging to their Owners; the Second of such Classes consisting of praedial apprenticed Labourers not attached to the Soil, and comprising all Persons who in their State of Slavery were usually employed in Agriculture, or in the Manufacture of Colonial Produce or otherwise, upon Lands not belonging to their Owners; and the Third of such Classes consisting of non praedial apprenticed Labourers and comprising all apprenticed Labourers not included within either of the Two preceding Classes: be it therefore enacted, That such Division as aforesaid of the said apprenticed Labourers into such Classes as aforesaid shall be carried into effect in such Manner and Form and subject to such Rules and Regulations as shall for that Purpose be established under such Authority, and in and by such Acts of Assembly, Ordinances, or Orders in Council, as herein after mentioned:

[Proviso.]

Provided always, that no Person of the Age of Twelve Years and upwards shall by or by virtue of any such Act of Assembly, Ordinance, or Order in Council be included in either of the said Two Classes of praedial apprenticed Labourers unless such Person shall for Twelve Calendar Months at the least next before the passing of this present Act have been habitually employed in Agriculture or in the Manufacture of Colonial Produce.

[Apprenticeship of the praedial Labourers not to continue beyond 1st August 1840; ]

V. And be it further enacted, That no Person who by virtue of this Act, or of any such Act of Assembly, Ordinance, or Order in Council as aforesaid, shall become a praedial apprenticed Labourer, whether attached or not attached to the Soil, shall continue in such Apprenticeship beyond the First Day of August One thousand eight hundred and forty; and that during such his or her Apprenticeship no such praedial apprenticed Labourer, whether attached or not attached to the Soil, shall be bound or liable, by virtue of such Apprenticeship, to perform any Labour in the Service of his or her Employer or Employers for more than Forty-five Hours in the whole in any One Week.

[of the non-praedial not beyond 1st August 1838.]

VI. And be it further enacted, That no Person who by virtue of this Act or of any such Act of Assembly, Ordinance, or Order in Council as aforesaid, shall become a non-praedial apprenticed Labourer, shall continue in such Apprenticeship beyond the First Day of August One thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight.

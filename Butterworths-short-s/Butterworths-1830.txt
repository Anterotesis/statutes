claimed, whether by Banns lawfully published in such Church or Chapel, or by Licence lawfully granted, should not have their Validity questioned on account of their having been so solemnized, nor should the Ministers who had so solemnized the same be liable to any Ecclesiastical Censure or to any other Proceeding whatsoever: And whereas the Ministers of certain Parish Churches and Chapels of Chapelries have, during the Repair or rebuilding of such Churches or Chapels, published the Banns of Marriages in some Places within the Limits of their Parishes or Chapelries respectively wherein Divine Service

4 Parish Churches and Chapels of Chapelries have, during the Repair or rebuilding of such Churches or Chapels, published the Banns of Marriages in some Places within the Limits of their Parishes or Chapelries respectively wherein Divine Service has been usually performed during the Time of such Repair or rebuilding, but have solemnized the Marriages themselves in the Churches or Chapels of the same or of some adjoining Parishes or Chapelries: And whereas other Clergymen, during the Time of such Repair or rebuilding, have published Banns of Marriage and solemnized Marriages in Places duly licensed for the Performance of Divine Worship, according to the Forms of the United Church of England and Ireland, within their respective Parishes or Chapelries, but not licensed specially for

4 such

' such Performance during such Time as aforesaid: And whereas

it is expedient that the Marriages so solemnized should not on

that Account have their Validity questioned; ' Be it therefore

enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the

Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and

Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the

Authority of the same, That all Marriages, the Banns whereof The Validity of

have been published in any Place used for the Performance of Marriages so-

Divine Service within the Limits of any Parish or Chapelry during If*^ under

the Repairs or rebuilding of the Church or Chapel thereof, which

Marriages have been solemnized either in the said Place so used menttoned7not

or in die Church or Chapel of the same or of some adjoining to be question-

Parish or Chapelry during such Repair or rebuilding, shall not «d.

have their Validity questioned on account of having been so

solemnized.

D. And be it further enacted, That in every Case in which the During the Church of any Parish or Place, in which Banns of Marriage may be Time that any published and Marriages solemnized, shall be pulled down, or be Churd^&c. is rebuilding or under Repair, it shall be lawful for the Bishop of the Diocese to order and direct that Banns of Marriage may be pub- moy lished and Marriages solemnized in any consecrated Chapel of Banns to be such Parish or Place which he shall by Order in Writing direct, published in "until the Church shall a^ain be opened for the Performance of Divine Service; and during all such Period the said consecrated i£ih7 Chapel shall, for all Purposes relating to the Publication of Banns of Marriage and to the Solemnization of Marriages, be deemed and taken to be the Church of the Parish, any thing in any Act or Acts to the contrary notwithstanding; and the Fees in respect thereof shall be applied, during such Period, as the Bishop of the

Diocese shall, with the Consent of the Incumbent, order and direct.

III. And whereas Doubts have arisen touching the Validity For removing of Marriages solemnized in Churches which have been made Doubts as to

Parishes, under the Provisions of an Act passed in the Fifty- ia

4 ing and promoting the building of additional Churches in populous

Parishes; And whereas it is expedient that such Doubts should be removed Therefore be it enacted, That all Marriages which have already been solemnized, or may hereafter be solemnized, in any Church which shall have been made and constituted the Church of a distinct Parish, or of a District Parish as aforesaid, after Consecration thereof and Assignment of a District thereto, shall be as good and valid in Law as if such Marriages had been solemnized in any Parish Church wherein Banns had been usually published before or at the Time of passing an Act made in the Twenty-sixth Year of King George the Second, intituled An Act 26 G.2. c.38. for the better preventing of clandestine Marriages.

IV. And whereas, by Error, Banns have been published, and The Validity of divers Marriages have been solemnized, in Chapels duly conse- Marriages so-

' nor Marriages by Law be solemnized; and it is expedient to

remove all Doubts arising from the Circumstances aforesaid

touching the due Publication of such Banns and the Validity of such Marriages; ' Therefore be it enacted, That all Banns already published, and all Marriages already solemnized, in such Chapels as aforesaid, shall not hereafter be questioned on account of the said Banns having been published, or the said Marriages. solemnized, in a Chapel not legally authorized for the Publication of Banns and the Solemnization of Marriages r Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to authorize the Publication of Banns or the Solemn-ization of Marriages in such Chapels hereafter.

V. And whereas divers Marriages have taken place in Chapels supposed to be consecrated, the Consecration of which Chapels,

however, cannot be proved, and may be doubted: And whereas

it is expedient that all Apprehensions touching the Validity of such Marriages, on this Account, should entirely be removed; Be it therefore enacted. That the Validity of such Marriages, shall not hereafter be questioned on account of the Uncertainty respecting the Consecration of such Chapels.

An Act to continue and amend the Laws for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors in England* [16th July 1830.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the Seventh Year of the ' W Reign of His present Majesty, intituled An Act to amend 1 and consolidate the Lam for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors in

England; and it is expedient to continue the said Act; ' Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said Act shall be and the same is hereby continued.

II. And be it further enacted, That all Provisions in the said Act contained, concerning the Removal of Assignees and the Appointment of new Assignees, and concerning Assignees' Accounts, and concerning the Amount of Debts, and Claims to receive Dividends, and the ascertaining thereof, and concerning all Matters to be done and observed, when it may appear to the Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors in any Case that all Debts have been discharged, and concerning the Proof or Evidence of Conveyances and Assignments, and of all Proceedings had or being of Record in the said Court, shall be deemed to extend to the Cases of all Persons who petitioned under the several Acts recited in the said Act, as well as of Persons petitioniim under the said Act.

III. And whereas Doubts have arisen whether Warrants of

Attorney, executed by Insolvent Debtors before Adjudication

made in the Matters of their Petitions pursuant to the several ' Acts passed for their Relief, are to be deemed secret Warrants 1 of Attorney within the Meaning and Provisions of an Act passed

in the Third Year of the Reign of His present Majesty (a) , intituled An Act for preventing Frauds on Creditors by secret War-

rants of Attorney to confess JudgmentIt is hereby declared

and enacted, That such Warrants of Attorney, executed and to be executed as aforesaid, are not within the Meaning and Provisions of the said last-mentioned Act; and that the same have been, are, and shall be valid and effectual, any thing in the said last-mentioned Act, or in any Act extending the Provisions thereof, notwithstanding. {<*) See 1 W. 4. c. 71.

IV. And whereas it is for the Benefit of Prisoners petitioning 1 the said Court, and especially of those whose Cases may be heard before a Commissioner, on Circuit, or before Justices of the Peace

at iheir Quarter Sessions in Wales or the Town of Bertvick-uponTxpeedy where it may appear in the Case of any such Prisoner, on the Hearing, that the Proof of Notice to Creditors is imperfect, 4 or that any other Matter or Thing ought to be done by or on behalf of such Prisoner before he or she is actually discharged from Custody, that nevertheless Adjudication should be made conditional upon such Matter or Thing being performed, and that the Hearing of such Case should stand adjourned only on Failure therein: And whereas Doubts haye arisen as to the Competency of proceeding in manner above mentioned It is hereby declared

and

C.S&.

265

and enacted. That where it shall appear to the said Court, Commissioner, or Justices, at the Hearing of the Matters of the Petition of any such Prisoner, that certain Matters or Tilings ought to be performed by or on behalf of such Prisoner, before he or she is entitled to be actually discharged from Custody, but that nevertheless it is expedient not to adjourn the Hearing of such Case absolutely to some future Occasion without the Opportunity of such Discharge being sooner had by doing such Things as aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful for the said Court, Commissioner, or Justices, to pronounce Adjudication, without then issuing the Order and Warrant pursuant thereto, and that such Adjudication may be directed to be conditional on the Performance of such Matters or Things as aforesaid, and that on the Non-performance thereof the Hearing of such Case shall stand adjourned according to the Direction made in that Behalf; and that all Proceedings heretofore had in manner aforesaid, in the Matters of the Petitions of any Prisoners petitioning the said Court, under any Act or Acts for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors, shall be deemed good and valid to all Intents and Purposes.

V. And whereas it may often happen that some Interest in 1 Lands and Tenements may become vested in the. Provisional

Assignee of the said Court, which appears to be of no Value to

Creditors, but nevertheless it may be reasonable and expedient

that the said Provisional Assignee should make or join in making ' some Conveyance or Assignment of the same, and that the same

should be done without the Expence attending Advertisements ' and Meetings of Creditors as prescribed by the said first-mentioned Act in certain CasesBe it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the said Court, at any Time after the Day gazetted for the Hearing of the Matters of the Petition of any Insolvent Debtor, if no Creditor shall have become Assignee of his or her Estate and Effects, and if it shall appear fit, upon such Notice given by Advertisement or otherwise to the Creditors or any of them as the said Court shall in any Case direct, to order the said Provisional Assignee to make or join in making any Conveyance or Assignment of any such Interest as to the said Court may appear just and reasonable, without observing the Provisions of the said first-mentioned Act as to the Sale of Real Property by the Provisional or other Assignees of the Estates of Insolvent Debtors.

VI. And it is further declared and enacted, That all Assignments and Conveyances heretofore made or to be made by such Provisional Assignee in any such Cases, by Order of the said Court, shall be and the same are hereby declared to be good and valid to all Intents and Purposes; any thing in the said first-mentioned Act or in any other Act to the contrary notwithstanding.

VII. And whereas it is expedient to prescribe a Form of Conveyance and Assignment from the Provisional Assignee to ' any other Assignee or Assignees when appointed by the said ' Court, and also to remove any Doubts as to the Validity or Effect ' of any Conveyances or Assignments at any Time heretofore made ' and executed by the said Provisional Assignee by virtue of any ' Order of the said CourtBe it therefore declared and enacted, That every Conveyance and Assignment hereafter to be made and executed by the Provisional Assignee for the Time being to any

VIII. And whereas it may happen that the Chief or other Com-

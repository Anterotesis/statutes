4 Town, and Place in the said Act specified, were severally directed to be assessed and collected in the Manner directed by the said Act of King William and Queen Mary: And whereas by an Act passed in the First Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the First, intituled An Act to oblige Papists lO.i, c.55.

4 Possessors thereof, and the }rearly Rent reserved to him or them c for the same: And whereas by several Acts passed subsequent to the said Act of the Fourth Year of the Reign of Their said Majesties King William and Queen Mary, for granting an Aid 4 by a Land Tax to be raised in Great Britain, it was declared,

4 amongst other Things, that since the making of the Assess* 4 ments by virtue of the said last<mentioned Act several of the said Papists and other Persons which were so doubly taxed had taken the said Oaths, or their Lands had come to Protestants, 4 whereby it was intended that their Estates should by such several Acts be charged only to such an equal Pound Kate as was to be borne by their Protestant Neighbours, and for that Purpose Provision was made by the said Acts for relieving such Lands from the Double Rate, and distributing the same by an equal Pound Rate over all Lands assessable in the same Parish, 4 Township, or Place, towards raising the Proportion of Land Tax thereon charged, with a Power for Relief, in case such Pro* 4 portion should thereby exceed the Land Tax of Four Shillings in the Pound on the full and improved yearly Values, by Application to the Court of Exchequer to discharge the Excess from the Assessments and Duplicates, in exoneration of the Parish, Township, or Place: And whereas by an Act passed in the Thirty-fourth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, intituled An Act for granting an Aid to His Majesty, by a Land Tax to be raised in Great Britain, for tie Service of the Year One thousand seven hundred and ninety far, 4 it was declared, amongst other Tilings, that towards the Assessments which were made by virtue of the said Act of the Fourth Year of the Reign of Their said Majesties King William and Queen Mary, the several Lands, Tenements, Rents, or other Hereditaments of Persons refusing or neglecting to take the Oaths therein contained were assessed to pay Double the Rates therein expressed; and that it was not by the reciting Act 4 intended to assess or impose any such Double Rates upon any Person or Persons whomsoever; and that the Estates of Persons formerly doubly taxed were thereby made liable to single Assessment only; with a Provision for distributing the Double Tax over the Parish, Township, or Place; and provided the Pound Rate should thereby exceed Four Shillings in the Pound, 4 a Power of Relief, by Application to the Court of Exchequer to discharge the Excess from the Assessments and Duplicates in manner aforesaid; and similar Provisions were contained in certain Acts passed in the Thirty-fifth, Thirty-sixth, Thirty* 4 seventh, and Thirty-eighth Years of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, but limiting the Periods for Application to the Court of Exchequer to the Twenty-ninth Day of September yearly: And whereas by an Act passed subsequently, in the said Thirty-eighth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, the Proportions and Sums directed to be raised for Land Tax by the said previous Act 4 of the same Year were made perpetual, subject to Redemption and Purchase; and large Proportions of the Land Tax hare been redeemed or purchased under the Provisions of the Act* 4 in force in that Behalf: And whereas some of His Majesty* 7 4 Subjects,

A.D. 1831. 1° & 2° GULIELMI IV. C.21.

4 Subjects, as well as such Persons to whom the Estates of Persons doubly rated or assessed have come or descended, as also 9 such Persons neglecting or refusing to take the Oaths mentioned or referred to in the Act of the Fourth Year of the Reign of Their said Majesties King William and Queen Mary, may not have obtained the Relief intended by the said Acts of His late Majesty King George the Third, but may have continued to be charged, in respect of their Lands, Tenements, Rents, and Hereditaments, with Double the said Rates or Assessments imposed by the said Act of Their said Majesties King William and Queen Mary, and borne and paid by their Protestant Neighbours in respect of their Lanas, Tenements, Rents, and Hereditaments: And whereas by reason of the Provisions of the said Acts for making the Land Tax perpetual, subject to annual Assessment in respect to the Proportions unredeemed, 4 Doubts have arisen whether the Power of Relief granted by the said Acts, in and prior to the said Year One thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight, by Application to the Court of Exchequer, are now in force, and Difficulties have also arisen in regard to the Manner and Form of obtaining Relief from Double Land Tax, by reason of the great Variation and Increase in the annual Value of Lands, and of the Proportions of Land Tax 4 which have been redeemed or exonerated from Assessment; 4 and it is expedient that such Doubts should be removed, and that the Mode of affording Relief should be more clearly defined be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same. That from and after the passing of this Act, in all Cases of Assessment for any Year commencing, where any Manors, Lands, Tenements, Rents, Hereditaments, or Estates which shall have a Proportion to raise by virtue of the said last-recited Act of the Thirty-eighth Year of the Reign of His said Majesty King George the Third shall be charged with a Double Rate, by the Valuation and Assessment of the same Manors, Lands, Tenements, Rents, Hereditaments, or Estates for the former Aid of Four Shillings in the Pound which was made in pursuance of the said Act of the Fourth Year of the Reign of Their said late Majesties King William and Queen Mary, and in all Cases where such Double Tax shall have been so charged on any Estates, and such Estates have not under the Provisions of the said Acts been made liable to a single Assessment only, it shall be lawful for the Commissioners of the Land Tax for the respective Counties, Districts, or Divisions where any such Manors, Lands, Tenements, Rents, Hereditaments, or Estates are situate, upon Complaint thereof before them being first made by or on behalf of the Owner or Occupier of such Manors, Lands, Tenements, Rents, Hereditaments, or Estates as aforesaid, to examine into the Matter of such Complaint, and to satisfy themselves of the Truth thereof, and, if they think necessary, to require Proof thereof by the Oaths of Two credible Witnesses, or by a Certificate or Office Copy from the Clerk of the Peace of the County wherein such Manors, Lands, Tenements, Rents, Hereditaments, or Estates are situate, of the Registry of such Manors, Lands,

WHEREAS it has been ascertained, as well by the Reports * of certain Commissioners appointed under the Authority

' of Parliament in the Year One thousand eight hundred and

nine as otherwise, that there are throughout Ireland, contiguous

to the Banks of Rivers and Streams and Lakes, many large Tracts of Lands, some covered with Water for not less than Half the Year, some periodically flooded, and others subject to 1 frequent Damage and Inundation by reason of the Defect of Embankments and Interruptions in the Channels of such Rivers and Streams: And whereas the said Tracts of Lands comprise generally the finest alluvial Soil, and, although in their present Condition of little Value, would, if protected against Inundation, become productive and fertile in an eminent Degree: And whereas the Reclamation and Protection of such Lands

vantage and Profit than to the general and public Good and Benefit of His City aforesaid, and by no means regarding the

Conservancy of the same River, did with Impunity, and then

daHy, usually sell Coals and other Things of that Sort by Retail in a less Quantity, in Boats commonly called Lighters, and other Vessels, floating, placed, and being in and upon the Water of Thames aforesaid, after the like Coals had been unladen from

the Ships and other Vessels which at first brought the same Coals and other Things of that Sort within the Limits and

Bounds abovesaid, upon the Water of Thames aforesaid, which said Persons made the Boats commonly called Lighters, and other Vessels, as it were their common Shops and Warehouses,

and in the same did daily hold, upon the Water of Thames aforesaid, a common Market for the Sale of the like Coals and other Things of that Sort, having One, Two, Three, and sometimes more Boats commonly called Lighters, and other Vessels, lying and affixed one to the other in the River Thames aforesaid, by which the forestalling, Monopoly, and regrating aforesaid growed and increased every Day, to the great Deception, Loss,

4 and Oppression as well of the rich as the poor, and the Prices of the Coals and other Things were augmented and rendered dearer; and that by the frequent Importation, carrying away,

4 measuring, and weighing the like Coals and other Things of that Sort into and out of the same Boats commonly called Lighters,

4 and other Vessels, a great many of the same Coals and other Filth very often fell and were thrown into the River Thames, to the great Nuisance and choking up of the Stream of the same River, and the aforesaid Boats and other Vessels so placed greatly impeded, as well the Course of the Stream of the River aforesaid as the Passage of those passing by upon the Water

4 of the same River; His said Majesty therefore, considering it just that so great an Evil ought not longer to be permitted to continue, but should as quickly as possible be put an end to and removed, did firmly order and enjoin, and for Him, His 4 Heirs and Successors, prohibit, all and singular Persons whatsoever, that neither they nor any of them should thenceforth sell nor presume to sell any Coals of any Kind whatever upon the Water of Thames, in any Boat commonly called Lighters,

4 or in any other Vessel whatsoever, except only in the same Ships or other Vessels which at first brought the like Coals within the Port of the City aforesaid, and within the Limits and Bounds abovesaid, and not otherwise, unless upon some Port, Quay, or Wharf near the River aforesaid, under pain of Contempt of His Royal Command, and of incurring such Pains and Penalties as by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm could be inflicted against the like Offenders for Disregard and Contempt; and because His said Majesty's Intention was that the same Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City aforesaid, and their Successors, should fully enjoy the Premises aforesaid, His said Majesty therefore, by the said Charter now in recital, did declare and signify His Will and Pleasure, and will, and for Him, His Heirs and Successors, grant and agree,

4 to and with the aforesaid Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City aforesaid, and their Successors, that the same Mayor

4 Ambiguity, or Question respecting the Premises arose or were made, His said Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, would vouchsafe to grant and make other Letters Patent under the Great Seal of England, of Him, His Heirs or Successors, to the same Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City aforesaid,

and their Successors, for the better Donation, Grant, and Confirmation, and for the more secure Enjoyment of the Premises,

4 to be sold by the Chaldron or Ton, there should be paid, by way of Imposition thereupon, according to the Rates and Duties after mentioned; (that is to say,) for all such Sorts of Coals or Culm as were usually sold by the Chaldron, for every Chaldron thereof which should be imported from and after the Twenty-fourth Day of June One thousand six hundred and ninety-four the Sum of Four-pence Metage for ever, over and above what was then lawfully paid for the Metage thereof, which said Sum should be paid in like Manner as the then present Duty for Metage was or had been accustomed to be paid, and from Time to Time be paid to the said Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the said City by the Officer and Officers receiving the said Metage; and for all such Sort of Coals or Culm « which should be imported into the said Port or Members thereof from and after the Twenty-ninth Day of September One thousand seven hundred,'(over and above all other Impositions and Duties, t and the above-mentioned Sum of Four-pence,) the further Sum t of Sixpence for every Chaldron thereof; and for such Sort of Coals as were sold by the Ton, foj* every Ton thereof containing

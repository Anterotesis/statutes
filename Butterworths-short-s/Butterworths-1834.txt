XI. And whereas by an Act passed in the Parliament of

Ireland in the Thirty-fifth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, intituled An Act for building a 4 Bridge over the River Shannon at Portumna in the County of

Galway, certain Persons therein named were constituted Trustees for receiving Subscriptions for building a Bridge over the

River Shdnnon where the Ferry of Portumna then was, and the Subscribers thereto were created, united, and elected into One ' Company, and were thenceforth to be One Body Politic and Corporate by the Name of the Commissioners for building a ' Bridge over the River Shannon at Portumna, with certain

Powers and Duties in the said Act particularly mentioned and ' set forth: And whereas the said Company was by the said Act authorized to demand and receive certain Sums therein specified in the Nature of Toll for Passage over the said Bridge, and

considerable Sums of Money on the Credit of the said Tolls, on

account of which Loans the said Commissioners are now indebted to the Extent of Three thousand Pounds or thereabouts:

And whereas, notwithstanding the Receipt of such Tolls, and of the Funds so produced on the Credit thereof, the said Bridge hath been neglected, and is now in such a State of Dilapidation and Decay as to be nearly impassable and useless, and it is therefore expedient that the Management of the said Bridge

should be otherwise conducted, and the Revenue arising therefrom more judiciously and properly appliedbe it therefore enacted, That from and after the Commencement of this Act the said Act of the Thirty-fifth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third shall be and the same is hereby repealed, save and except as to any Matters or Things heretofore aone or which have heretofore taken place under the Authority thereof.

XIV. And be it enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Lord Lieutenant or other Chief Governor or Governors of Ireland to appoint Three or more Persons for the Purpose of investigating and reporting upon the respective Proportions in which the Counties likely to derive Benefit from the said Portumna Bridge shall contribute to the Expences of reconstructing and repairing the same, which Persons so appointed shall be at liberty, if they should so think fit, to cause proper Plans, Maps, Estimates, and Specifications to be made, for the Purpose of guiding their Judgments upon the Matter so submitted to them, the Expences whereof, and of all Things by them directed as aforesaid, shall be deemed and taken to be Part of the Charges connected with the said Bridge, and shall be defrayed in the like

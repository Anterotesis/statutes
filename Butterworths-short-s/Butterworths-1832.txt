VII. And be it further enacted, That in all Deeds, Conveyances, Leases, Contracts, and other Instruments touching any Estate, Property, Matter, or Thing relating to the Naval Service, or to any Department under the Controul of the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, or whereto they or any of them shall be Parties, it shall be sufficient to describe them generally by the Style and Title of "The " Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral " of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland." without expressing their Names; and that all such Deeds, Conveyances, Leases, Contracts, and other Instruments wherein the said Commissioners shall be so described, and the Execution thereof by any Two of them, shall be as valid and effectual to all Intents and Purposes as if they or any of them had been expressly named therein.

VII.

IX. And be it further enacted, That from and after the Revocation of the said Letters Patent all Applications, Communications, and Notices, and all Prize and other Lists and Accounts, and all Bills, Tickets, Books, Documents, and Papers, which by any Act of Parliament are required to be made, given, or transmitted to the Commissioners of the Navy or Victualling, shall be made, given, and transmitted to the Secretary of the Admiralty, in order that the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid may thereupon cause the necessary Measures to be taken for carrying into effect the Intentions of the said Acts; and that all Certificates, Tickets, Vouchers, and other Documents heretofore by any Act or Acts authorized to be given or made out by the Commissioners of the Navy or Victualling shall be made and given by the Secretary of the Admiralty, or by such other Person as shall for that Purpose be directed by the said Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid.

X. And whereas it is deemed expedient that the Duties

hitherto performed by Commissioners at the several Dock

Yards and other Naval and Victualling Establishments at Home and Abroad shall in future be executed by Officers to be

called Superintendents; be it therefore further enacted, That from and after the Revocation of the said Letters Patent such Superintendents from Time to Time to be appointed shall have full Power and Authority to do, execute, and perform all and every the Duties, Matters, and Things which by any Act or Acts of Parliament now in force any Commissioner of the Navy or Victualling resident at any Naval or Victualling Yard or Establishment, or at any Naval Hospital, at Home or Abroad, is authorized or required to do: Provided always, that in the Absence of such Superintendent his Duty as to the signing of Bills, Certificates, and Vouchers, and in other respects in which the Acts of a Commissioner have been required, may be executed by the Officer next in Seniority to him, such Officer noticing, after his Signature, the Fact of the Superintendents Absence.

XI. And be it further enacted, That the Superintendents so to be appointed shall have and they are hereby invested with full Power and Authority to administer Oaths, and to exercise the Duties, Powers, and Authorities of Justices of the Peace, in all Places whatever, and in all Matters relating to His Majesty's Naval Service, and to the Stores, Provisions, Ammunition, and the Accounts thereof, and in all other Cases whatever in which any Commissioner of the Navy or Victualling is empowered to

act as a Justice by any Act or Acts now in force, in as full a Manner to all Intents and Purposes as if such Superintendents had been named in any such Act or Acts, or in any Commission of the Peace for any such Places; and that all the Laws made and to be made for the Ease, Safety, and Protection of Justices of the Peace in the Execution of their Office shall extend to such Superintendents, and to all Constables and other Peace Officers and Persons acting under the Warrant or Authority of any such Superintendent, as fully and effectually as any such Laws can be deemed to extend to any Justice or Justices of the Peace, and to the Persons acting under them.

XII. And whereas by the said Act of the Eleventh Year of Inspectors Duty King George the Fourth, for consolidating the Laws relating to wifch r^Bar*| to

the Pay of the Navy, Provision is made for the Payment, with- Sum

out Probate or Administration, in Cases of Sums not exceeding

Thirty-two Pounds payable on account of Pay, Half Pay, or Pension of deceased Officers of the Navy and Marines, and of ' Pensions of deceased Widows of Officers, and on account of Allowances from the Compassionate Fund: And whereas by reason of the Abolition of the Office of Paymaster of Marines,

and of the Transfer of Part of the Duties of the Treasurer of the Navy, it is become necessary to make further Provision in

such Cases, and also in the Cases of Sums not exceeding Twenty Pounds due to any deceased Persons on account of any Prize Money, and for the Services of deceased Non-commissioned Officers and Marines; be it therefore further enacted,

That from and after the passing of this Act the Investigation of all Claims to the Effects of any such deceased Persons shall be made by the Inspector of Seamen's Wills in the Manner required by the said recited Act in Cases of similar Claims to Pay for Services in the Royal Navy; and the said Inspector, after duly investigating the Claim, and the Amount of the Deceased's Assets, is hereby authorized in any such Cases to issue a Check or Certificate, as is required by the said Act with respect to Naval Pay; and that ail Payments not exceeding in the whole Thirty-two Pounds of Pay, Half Pay, Pension, or Allowances of deceased Officers of the Navy and Marines, and of Widows Pensions, and of Allowances from the Compassionate Fund, and all Payments not exceeding in the whole Twenty Pounds of Monies due to any deceased Persons on account of Prize Money, and for the Services of deceased Non-commissioned Officers, Drummers, and Privates of Marines, to be made under any such Certificate, shall be as effectual and legal as if the same had been made under any Probate of a Will or Letters of Administration:

Provided always, that in order to allow Time for the Production of any Will which may have been made by any such deceased Person, and to guard against Fraud, no Check or Certificate whatever shall be granted in lieu of Letters of Administration, under this or the said recited Act, until Three Calendar Months shall have elapsed from the Time of Notice being given to the Inspector of the Death of the Person whose Effects are claimed.

XIII. And for the better Investigation of Claims to the Effects Inspector may of deceased Persons under this or the said recited Act, be it administer further enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act the °aths *

Fees on Probates, &c. contained in the Schedule to this Act to be taken in lieu of those specified in 11 G. 4. c. 20.

Proctors and others indemnified for receiving greater Fees than allowed by Act 11 G. 4? c. 20.

Mode of Payment of Half Pay, &c. provided by 11 G.4. c. 20. extended to Marine Half Pay and Pensions, and to Officers Widows, being insane.

said Inspector shall have full Power and Authority to administer an Oath or Affirmation to any Claimants touching their Claims, either as the Representatives or the Creditors of the Deceased, and to the Witnesses to be adduced in support of any such Claims; and that the Certificate of the Allowance of the Claim shall be in such Form as the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral shall authorize.

XIV. And whereas by the said Act of the Eleventh Year of

King George the Fourth Provision is made for limiting the ' Expence of obtaining Probates of Wills and Letters of Administration to the Effects of deceased Officers, Seamen, and ' Marines, and it is expedient that the Schedule of Fees to be allowed in such Cases should, on account of Inaccuracies

therein, be alteredbe it therefore further enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act the several Sums set forth in the Table of Fees contained in the Schedule annexed to this Act, and which shall be deemed as Part hereof, shall be allowed and taken, in the Cases respectively therein mentioned, in lieu of those specified in the Schedule of the said recited Act; and if any Registrar, Proctor, or other Person shall demand or receive more than the several Sums respectively allowed by the Schedule annexed to this Act, every Person so offending shall forfeit the Sum of Fifty Pounds, which shall be recoverable, with Costs of Suit, and applicable in the same Manner as is provided by the said recited Act with respect to pecuniary Penalties exceeding Twenty Pounds: Provided nevertheless, that if any Increase or Diminution shall take place in the Stamp Duties payable in respect of any such Probates or Letters of Administration, or of any Instrument connected therewith, the Sums to be allowed shall be increased or diminished to the Extent of the Alteration in such Stamp Duties; and provided also, that in Cases of extraordinary Trouble or Expence such additional Allowance shall be made as shall appear reasonable to the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid.

XV. And inasmuch as a strict Adherence to the Letter of such inaccurate Schedule would have produced a Burden upon the Relations of deceased Seamen not intended by the said recited Act, be it further enacted, That all Registrars, Proctors, and others who may, under the Authority of the Treasurer of the Navy or his Officers, have been allowed or have received more or other than the Sums set forth in the said inaccurate Schedule, shall be and are hereby indemnified and released from all Penalties and Forfeitures which under the said recited Act they may have incurred on any such Account.

XVI. And whereas by the said recited Act of the Eleventh Year of His late Majesty Provision is made for the Payment of Naval Half Pay and Pensions by a Mode called an Extract, upon Notice to be given to the Clerk of the Treasurer of the Navy by the Person desiring to be so paid, and Provision is

also made for the Payment of the Pensions of Officers and others becoming insane to the Persons having the Care and Maintenance of them, and it is expedient to extend the said

Provisionsbe it therefore further enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act such Mode of Payment by Extract

A.D. 1832. 2° GULIELMI IV. C. 40.

133

shall, if required by the Parties, be adopted with respect to Marine Half Pay and Pensions, and that the Notifce shall be given to the Superintendent of the Dock Yard at which the Party shall be desirous to be so paid; and that in all Cases of Widows of Naval and Marine Officers entitled to any Pension becoming or being insane, or otherwise from their State of Mind incompetent to the Management of their Affairs, it shall be lawful for the Treasurer of the Navy, under the Authority of the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral, to pay over to the Relative or other Person having the Care and Maintenance of any such Widow such Pension, or such Portion thereof as the said Commissioners shall think fit, to be applied to the Maintenance and Support of such insane or incompetent Person; and every such Payment shall be deemed valid, and an effectual Discharge to the said Treasurer for so much as shall be so paid.

XVII. And whereas by the said recited Act Agents employed

in the Receipt of Wages in respect of Services in the Royal Navy are prohibited from taking more than Sixpence in the Pound for receiving and paying over the same, and for all their Trouble in relation thereto: And whereas certain Officers are permitted to receive Part and others the Whole of their Pay 4 by drawing Bills for the same, although it is required of them to pass Documents and Accounts annually or on quitting their Ships, so that no Pay may be received by the Agent, out of which he can deduct the Allowance of Sixpence in the Pound,

or be in any Manner compensated for his Trouble in transacting the Business of the Officer in his Absence, or for passing his Accounts, and it is therefore necessary to explain and amend the said Act in this respectbe it therefore further enacted and declared, That such Prohibition shall not be deemed to extend to prevent any Agent from charging or receiving from any Commission or Warrant Officer (save and except in the Cases of passing Accounts, for which especial Provision is made in the said Act,) such reasonable Compensation as such Agent may be fairly entitled to charge, or as may be agreed upon between them, for any Trouble or Pains of such Agent in transacting for any such Commission or Warrant Officer any Business or Affairs not relating to the Receipt of Pay, Prize Money, or other Allowances.

XVIII. And whereas by the said recited Act it is enacted, in Cases of monthly Payments of Pay to the Seamen of the Navy, in the Absence of the Purser, or in Ships not having a Purser, the Commanding Officer shall act and be deemed to be the Purser for all the Purposes of such Payments: And whereas it

is found expedient that in certain Ships not having Pursers the Duty of Purser shall be performed by the Clerk of the Ship instead of the Commanding Officer be it therefore enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, in all such Cases as aforesaid, the Payment shall and may be made by the Clerk so appointed to do the Duty of Purser, in the Presence of the Commanding Officer and of another Commissioned Officer, if there be One belonging to the Ship, and if not, then in the Presence of the Commanding Officer and the Person acting as

Agents Commission.

Monthly Payments in Ships not having Pursers to be made by the Clerk instead of the Commanding Officer.

Master or One of the Mates of the Ship, ientitled to draw Bills, which Officers shall attest the Lists as required by the said Act.

XIX. And whereas by Three several Acts of Parliament

relating to the Receipt of Naval Prize Money, passed in the ' Fifty-seventh and Fifty-ninth Years of His late Majesty King George the Third, and in the First Year of His late Majesty 1 King George the Fourth, certain Provisions are established

with regard to the licensing, by the Treasurer of the Navy, of

Agents to receive the Pay and Prize Money of Petty Officers,

Seamen, and Marines be it further enacted, That all such Licences to Agents, and to the Representatives of deceased Agents, as by the said several Acts or by any other Act are authorized to be granted by the Treasurer of the Navy, shall, from and after the Commencement of this Act, as herein-after mentioned, be granted by an Officer to be for that Purpose appointed by the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral, which Commissioners shall have full Power and Authority, from Time to Time as they shall see requisite, to revoke such Licences, in case of Neglect in any such licensed Agent duly to account for and pay over all Monies received by him, or of any deceitful, fraudulent, or dishonest Conduct practised by any such Agent towards any Person or Persons on whose Behalf he shall have been employed, or towards any Person claiming through or under them; and that all such licensed Agents shall from Time to Time give such Notice in Writing to the Secretary of the Admiralty of their Change of Abode as by the said Act of the Fifty-ninth Year of King George the Third is required to be given to the Treasurer of the Navy: Provided always, that every such Agent so to be licensed shall enter into Bond with Sureties to His Majesty, as required by the said Act of the First Year of His Majesty King George the Fourth, in such Form as to the said Commissioners shall appear requisite.

XX. And whereas an Act was passed in the Tenth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Fourth, for transferring the Management of Greenwich Out-Pensions, and ' certain Duties in Matters of Prize, to the Treasurer of the Navy; and it is expedient that such Management and Duties,

so far as regards Matters of Prize only, should be placed under ' the Care of the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaidbe it therefore further enacted, That from and after the Commencement of this Act, as herein-after mentioned, the several Duties in Matters of Prize, and all the Powers and Authorities relating thereto respectively, which by the said last-recited Act were vested in the Treasurer of the Navy, shall be and the same are hereby transferred to and vested in the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid; reserving always to the said Treasurer the Duty of making all Payments and receiving all Monies as by the same Act is directed and provided in that Behalf.

XXI. And be it further enacted, That so much of the said last-mentioned Act as relates to the Form of Remittance Bills shall be and the same is hereby repealed; and that from henceforth Remittance Bills for Greenwich Out-Pensions, and the Certificate and Receipt to be required on Payment thereof, shall be

2° GULIELMI IV. C. 40.

135

in such Form as the Treasurer of the Navy for the Time being shall from Time to Time authorize and direct; and that Remittance Bills for Prize Money, of which the Management is by this Act intended to be transferred to the said Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral, shall, from and after such Transfer, be made in the same Manner and subject to the same Regulations in all respects as are provided with regard to Payments relating to Naval and Marine Pay and Pensions, or in such other Manner and Form as the said Commissioners shall from Time to Time authorize and direct; and in case of such Payments being made upon Remittance Bills by any Officer of the Revenue, Repayment thereof shall be made to the respective Departments of the Revenue in the Manner provided by the said recited Act of the Eleventh Year of King George the Fourth with respect to other Remittance Bills, an Account of which Bills shall be forwarded, if for Out-Pensions, to the Treasurer of the Navy, and if for Prize, to the Admiralty Office, in order that such Account may be examined by the proper Officer of the respective Departments, and, if found correct, that Measures may be taken for causing Repayment to be made by the said Treasurer to the respective Departments of the Revenue accordingly; and in all Cases of Remittance Bills for Prizes made out and not paid, owing to the Death of the Party, or other Cause, such Bills shall be returned to the Admiralty Office to be cancelled.

XXII. And be it further enacted and declared, That all Monies which previously to the Transfer of the Management of Out-Pensions and Duties in Matters of Prize to the Treasurer of the Navy, by the said recited Act of the Tenth Year of King George the Fourth, were, under any other Act or Acts of Parliament, made payable to the Treasurer of Greenwich Hospital, or for the Benefit of that Establishment, on account of undistributed Prize or Bounty Money, or of unclaimed or forfeited Shares of such Monies, or on any other Account, which are now outstanding in the Hands of any Agent or Agents, or which have not been paid over by such Agent or Agents, or which may hereafter arise or be payable, shall be deemed to be Public Monies owing to His Majesty, and shall and may be sued for and recovered in the same Manner as any other Debts due to His Majesty may by Law be recovered.

XXIII. And whereas by the said Act of the Tenth Year of

His late Majesty King George the Fourth it is enacted, that the Allowance of Sixpence per Month, commonly called Naval Six-

pences, payable out of the Wages of all Seamen and others

who shall serve or be employed in any of His Majesty's Ships or Vessels, shall cease to be payable to Greenwich Hospital: And whereas the said Enactment was intended to extend and ' take Effect with respect to the Wages of the Crews of His Majesty's Ships and Vessels of War in Commission only, and

it is expedient that the Crews of His Majesty's Ships and ' Vessels employed in the various other Departments of the ' Public Service should contribute towards the Support of the said Hospital as they had done before the passing of the said ' Act; be it therefore enacted and declared, That from and after the passing of this Act the said Allowance of Sixpence per

XXIV. And whereas by an Act passed in the First Year of ' His present Majesty's Reign, intituled An Act to consolidate and 6 amend the several Acts relating to the Office of Treasurer of His Majesty's Navy, various Regulations are established for the 6 Government of the Commissioners of the Navy and Victualling ' respectively, and of the Treasurer of the Navy, in regard to ' the soliciting of Monies wanted for the Service of the Navy, ' and to the Accounts, Custody, and Disposal of such Monies; and it is necessary to alter the same Regulations, and to make further Provision in regard to the same be it further enacted, That from and after the Revocation of the said Letters Patent all Monies wanted for the Service of the Navy shall be solicited by the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, and shall be for Naval Services generally, and that in the Letter soliciting the same the said Commissioners shall specify the general Balance of Public Monies remaining in the Treasurer's Hands; and that One Account only of the Monies issued from the Exchequer to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England shall be raised in the Books of the said Governor and Company, and shall be entitled generally for Naval Services, a corresponding Account with which shall be kept by the said Treasurer; and upon Receipt of all such Monies from the Exchequer the said Treasurer snail certify the Amount to the said Commissioners: Provided always, that no Monies paid into the Bank of England on account of the Treasurer of the Navy, or for Naval Services, shall be paid thereout, except upon Drafts for Naval Services, to be drawn by the Treasurer or One of his Cashiers, upon several Accounts to be raised in the Bank Books by the Treasurer, or the Person duly authorized by him, in the joint Names of the said Treasurer and of his respective Cashiers; and provided also, that nothing in the said recited Act or in this Act contained shall be deemed to extend to prohibit the said Treasurer (by himself or by the Person authorized by him) from raising Sub-Accounts, in the Names of the Treasurer and any of his Cashiers, in the Books of the said Governor and Company, as has for the Safety and Convenience of the Public Service been heretofore the Practice, so that no Monies are paid out of the Bank except upon Drafts as herein is directed.

XXV. And be it further enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act the annual Accounts required by the said last-recited Act to be made up by the Treasurer of the Navy shall be an Account of Naval Services generally, and shall

XXXI. And whereas by the uniform Practice of the Navy the ' several Payments herein-after specified have been vouched by ' the Attestation of Witnesses to such Payments only, without

requiring from the Party receiving the same any Acquittance ' for the Amount so paid, and Certificates of the Amounts of ' such Payments so attested have been received as Vouchers

in such Certificates respectively charged, conformably with the Practice which has hitherto prevailed.

XXXII. And be it further enacted, That if any Person shall forge or falsely make any Certificate to be given under the Authority of this Act by the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral, or any of them, or by any Superintendent, of the Purchase or Sale of any Naval or Victualling Stores, or shall utter or publish any false or altered Certificate of any such Purchase or Sale, knowing the same to be false; or if any Person shall take a false Oath, or make a false Affirmation, or give false Evidence before any Commissioner or Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, or before any Superintendent or Inspector of Seamen's Wills, touching any Matter which the said Commissioners or any of them, or any Superintendent or Inspector, are or is authorized to inquire into; every such Person, being duly convicted of any such Offence or Offences, shall be liable to suffer such Punishment, Pains, and Penalties as Persons guilty of wilful and corrupt Perjury are by Law subject to.

XXXIV. And whereas by an Act of the Thirty-ninth and Fortieth Years of His late Majesty King George the Third, for the better preventing the Embezzlement of His Majesty's Naval, 4 Ordnance, and Victualling Stores, certain Rewards of Twenty 6 Pounds and Five Pounds are directed to be paid in the respec-

tive Cases therein mentioned, for the Discovery of Offences

relating to such Stores, and it is expedient that the Amount of the said Rewards should be reduced; be it therefore further enacted, That upon Convictions of Persons for any Offence touching His Majesty's Naval, Ordnance, or Victualling Stores, to be discovered after the passing of this Act, the Payment of Rewards shall be in the Discretion of the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, or of the Master General and principal Officers of the Ordnance, as the Case may be; and that instead of the Rewards of Twenty Pounds and Five Pounds respectively payable under the said Act, the Rewards following shall be paid; (that is to say,) any Sum not exceed-

WHEREAS a Combination against the Payment of Tithes

« has for some Time existed in certain Parts of Ireland,

and the ordinary Remedies provided by Law for the Recovery

thereof have been evaded and defeated; and great Numbers of the Clergy have been in consequence deprived of their legal Maintenance, and many of them reduced to a State of great

Distress: And whereas it is necessary to make special Enact-

raents in order to vindicate the Authority of the Law, and to

provide immediate Relief for such of the Clergy as are now ' suffering from the Deprivation of their Incomes through the

unlawful Combination aforesaid:' Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful for the Lord Lieutenant or other Chief Governor or Governors of Ireland, at any Time or Times within One Year from the passing of this Act, with the Advice of the Privy Council of Ireland, upon Application made as herein-after provided, to issue and advance, or cause to be issued and advanced, out of the Consolidated Fund of Great Britain and Ireland, such Sums of Money, not exceeding in the whole the Sum of Sixty thousand Pounds, as may be from Time to Time necessary, to be applied to the Purposes and replaced in the Manner herein-after mentioned.

II. And be it enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for any Ecclesiastical Person entitled in that Character to the Tithes or any Portion* of the Tithes of apy Parish or Union, or Part of a Parish or Union, in Ireland, or to any Composition or Portion of a Composition for such Tithes, payable by virtue of any Law in force in Ireland respecting such Compositions, and who may have been prevented by the Combination herein-before mentioned from receiving or recovering the Tithes or Composition, or Portion thereof respectively, to which he may have been so entitled for the Year last past, that is to say, for the Year One thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, to make Application to the said Lord Lieutenant or other Chief Governor or Governors of Ireland, praying Relief under ttyis Act, and such Application shall be made by a Memorial stating the Right in which such Ecclesiastical Person is entitled to such Tithes or Composition, and whether to the Whole or any and what Proportion thereof, and the Amount or Value thereof, according to his average annual Receipts for the Three Years next preceding the said Year last past, or as the same may have been fixed by Composition or Agreement, as the Case may be, and the Amount in arrear for the Year last past, and the Proceedings which he may have taken for the receiving or recovering such Arrears, and by what Means the same have been rendered ineffectual; and to each such Memorial a Schedule shall be annexed, setting out the Names,

An Act to authorize (in Parishes inclosed under any Act of Parliament) the letting of the Poor Allotments in small Portions to industrious Cottagers.

[1st June 1832.]

WHEREAS in Parishes inclosed under Acts of Parliament there are in many Cases Allotments made for the Benefit

of the Poor, chiefly with a view to Fuel, which are now comparatively useless and unproductive: And whereas it would tend much to the Welfare and Happiness of the Poor if those Allotments could be let at a fair Rent, and in small Portions, to industrious Cottagers of good Character, while the Distribution of Fuel might be augmented by appropriating the said Rents to the Purchase of an additional Quantity; be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful for the Trustees of the said Allotments, together with the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor, in Parish Vestry assembled, and they are hereby required, to let Portions of any such Allotment, not less than One Fourth of a Statute Acre, and not exceeding One such Acre, to any One Individual, according to their Discretion, as a yearly Occupation from Michaelmas to Michaelmas, (and at such Rent as Land of the same Quality is usually let for in the said Parish,) to such industrious Cottagers of good Character, being Day Labourers or Journeymen legally settled in the said Parish, and dwelling within or near its Bounds, as shall apply for the same in the Manner herein-after mentioned.

II. Provided also, and be it further enacted, That the Person hiring the same shall be held bound to cultivate it in such a Manner as shall preserve the Land in a due State of Fertility.

III. And be it further enacted, That for the Purpose of carrying this Act into effect a Vestry shall be held in the First Week in September in every Year, of which Ten Days Notice shall be given in the usual Manner, at which Vestry the Trustees of the said Allotments may attend and vote, if they shall so think fit, and at which Vestry, or some Adjournment thereof, any industrious Cottager of good Character who may desire to rent such Portion of Land as aforesaid may apply for the same; and the said Vestry are hereby required, taking into consideration the Character and Circumstances of the Applicant, to determine the Case, either by rejecting his Application, or by making an Order that he shall be permitted to occupy such Portion of the Poor Allotment, being not less than One Fourth of a Statute Acre nor

15 exceeding

2° GULIELMI IV. C. 42.

CAP. LXXXI.

An Act to enable His Majesty to carry into effect a Convention made between His said Majesty and the Emperor of all the Russias.

[3d August 1832.]

WHEREAS by a Convention made and signed at London

4 on the Sixteenth Day of November in the Year One thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, between His Majesty and the Emperor of all the Russias, His said Majesty and the said Emperor of all the Russias, considering that the Events

which had occurred in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands since the Year One thousand eight hundred and thirty had 6 rendered it necessary that the Courts of Great Britain and

Russia should examine the Stipulations of their Convention of the Nineteenth Day of Mag One thousand eight hundred and fifteen, as well as of the Additional Article annexed thereto,

considering that such Examination had led the Two High Contracting Parties to the Conclusion that complete Agreement

did not exist between the Letter and Spirit of that Convention,

when regarded in connection with the Circumstances which had attended the Separation that had taken place between the

Two principal Divisions of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, but that, on referring to the Object of the above-

mentioned Convention of the Nineteenth Day of Mag One thousand eight hundred and fifteen, it appeared that that Object

was to afford to Great Britain a Guarantee that Russia would c on all Questions concerning Belgium identify her Policy with that which the Court of London had deemed the best adapted

for the Maintenance of a just Balance of Power in Europe, and

on the other Hand to secure to Russia the Payment of a Portion 6 of her old Dutch Debt, in consideration of the general Arrange *

ments of the Congress of Vienna, to which she had given her c Adhesion, Arrangements which remained in full Force, Their

said Majesties, being desirous that the same Principles should

continue to govern their Relations to each other, and that the special Tie which the Convention of the Nineteenth Day of

Mag One thousand eight hundred and fifteen had formed between the Two Courts should be maintained, agreed upon and concluded the following Articles, among others; that is

to say,

Article

fifteen, according to the Mode and until the Completion of the Sum fixed for Great Britain in the said Convention:

Article II. — In virtue of the same Considerations His Majesty the Emperor of all the Ritssias engages that if (which God forbid) the Arrangements agreed upon for the Indepen-i dence and the Neutrality of Belgium, and to the Maintenance of which the Two High Powers are equally bound,

should be endangered by the Course of Events, He will

not contract any other Engagement without a previous

Agreement with His Britanic Majesty, and His formal

Assent:

And whereas the said Convention has been ratified, and the Ratifications thereof were exchanged on the Twenty-first Day of June last: And whereas by the Stipulations of the said Convention of the Nineteenth Day of May in the Year One thousand eight hundred and fifteen, between His Majesty the King of the Netherlands and His late Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, to which His late Majesty King George the Third agreed to be a Party, mentioned in the said recited Convention. 4 of the Sixteenth Day of November One thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, His Majesty the King of the Netherlands, by the ' First Article thereof, engaged to take upon himself a Part of the Capital, and Arrears of Interest to the First Day of January One thousand eight hundred and sixteen, of the Russian Loan made in Holland through the Intervention of the House of Hope and Company in Amsterdam, to the Amount of Twenty-

five Millions of Florins, Dutch Currency, the annual Interest of

which Sum, together with an annual Payment for the Liquidation of the same, as thereafter specified, should be borne by and

become a Charge upon the Kingdom of the Netherlands; and ' His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland engaged on His Part to recommend to His Parliament to enable Him to take upon Himself an equal Capital of the said Russian Loan, videlicet. Twenty-five Millions of

Florins, Dutch Currency, the annual Interest of which [Sum,

together with an annual Payment for the Liquidation of the same, as thereafter specified, should be borne by and become 4 a Charge upon the Government of His Britanic Majesty: And 4 by the Second Article it was provided that the future Charge to which Their said Belgic and Britanic Majesties should be respectively liable in equal Shares, on account of the said Debt,

was to consist of an annual Interest of Five per Centum on the said Capitals, each of Twenty-five Millions of Florins, together f with a Sinking Fund of One per Centum for the Extinction of the same, the said Sinking Fund being subject however to be

increased, on the Demand of the Russian Government, to any ' annual Sum not exceeding Three per Centum, the same to be payable till the Capital of the said Debt should be fully discharged, when the aforesaid Charge for Interest and Sinking

4 Fund should wholly cease to be borne by Their said Belgic and Britanic Majesties respectively: And by the Third Article Their said Belgic and Britanic Majesties respectively bound themselves, on or before the usual Day or Days in each Year on which the Interest on the said Debt should be due and payable, to deposit with the Agent of the Russian Government in Holland their respective Proportions of the said Interest and Sinking Fund as above specified: Provided always, that previously to the Advance of each successive Instalment so to be paid the said Agent should be authorized to furnish a

Certificate to each of the said Two High Contracting Parties,

but without invalidating the aforesaid Appointments; and also

that other Provisions should be made for the future Regulation of the said Register Office Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said recited Act of the Ninth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Fourth shall be, from the Thirty-first Day of December One thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, and the same is hereby from that Day repealed; and also that Three several Treasury Minutes founded upon the said Act, and dated respectively, Two of them the Twenty-seventh Day of July, and the other the Seventeenth Day of December, in the Year One thousand eight hundred and thirty, and which Minutes were all of them laid before Parliament on the Twenty-third Day of the said Month of December, be rescinded: Provided always, that no Appointment made or Security given under

XXVIII. And whereas it is expedient that a summary Mode

of hearing any Complaint against any Person in the said Regis-

ter Office should be provided; be it therefore enacted, That upon any Complaint made on Oath, before any of His Majesty's superior Courts of Law or Equity in Dublin, of any Neglect, Default, or Misconduct of the Registrar or any Assistant Registrar, or Clerk employed in the said Register Office, it shall be lawful for such Court, or any of the Judges or a Judge thereof, and the said Court, Judges or Judge, are hereby required in open Court to hear and determine such Complaint in a summary Manner; and the said Court, Judges or Judge, if they or he shall think proper, may examine upon Oath the Party complaining and the Party complained against, and dismiss the Complaint, with reasonable Costs, if the Complaint shall appear frivolous or vexatious, or award Compensation to the Complainant, or impose a pecuniary Penalty or Fine upon the Party complained against to any Amount not exceeding the Sum of One hundred Pounds, or adjudge the Party complained of to be amoved from his Place in the said Office, as the Case may require, and shall forthwith cause a Copy of the Judgment pronounced upon such Complaint to be laid before the Lord Lieutenant Or other Chief Governor or Governors of Ireland, and thereupon it shall be lawful for the said Lord Lieutenant or other Chief Governor or Governors of Ireland to order the Person upon the Complaint against whom such Judgment was given to pay such Penalty, Fine, or Compensation, or to be removed from his Office or Employment in the said Register Office, or to order the said Registrar, out of any Salary that may be due or that shall accrue to the Person against whom such Judgment shall have been given, to pay and discharge such Penalty, Fine, or Compensation aforesaid; and where such Penalty or Fine shall be imposed, the Amount of such Penalty shall be paid into the said Register Office, and shall be applied as if the same had accrued from Fees paid in the said Office; and in case of Nonpayment of the Damages aforesaid, the Person to whom such Compensation shall be ordered to be paid may sue for the same in an Action of Debt in any Court of Record in the City of Dublin.

XXIX. And whereas great Difficulties have occasionally been experienced in the said Register Office from a Want of a sufficiently full Description being inserted in the Memorial of the

Place in which the Lands are situated, and it is fitting that in

future Memorials such Omissions should not be left unsup-

plied; be it therefore enacted, That from the said Thirty-first Day of December, in every Memorial of any Deed or Instrument dated after the Thirty-first Day of December One thousand eight hundred and thirtywo, brought into the said Office to be registered, there shall be specified the County and Barony, or the Town or County of a City, and Parish, or the Town and Parish, in which the Lands and every of them to be affected by registering such Memorial are by such Deed or Instrument stated to be situated; and where the Lands lie in Two or more Counties, or Baronies or Parishes or Streets, or partly in One Barony, Parish, or Street, and partly in another, the same shall be distinctly

stated in the Memorial from the Deed; and further, that where the Instrument to which the Memorial relates shall contain a Plan of the Lands or of any Part thereof, there may, if it be the Pleasure of the Party requiring the Registration of the Memorial, be inserted in or be annexed on Parchment to the Memorial; of such Instrument to be registered a Copy of such Plan; and moreover, that every Memorial brought into the said Office to be registered shall be there compared with the Instrument of which it purports to be a Memorial, and if the several Particulars required by Law to be in the Memorial shall be contained therein, or such of the Particulars by this Act required to be set forth in the Abstract Book herein-before mentioned as shall be contained therein shall be found to be truly stated from the Instrument, then the Memorial shall be registered, but not otherwise.

XXX. Provided always, and be it enacted, That where a Memorial shall be required to be registered of any Instrument whatsoever, other than a Will, which Instrument shall bear Date on or before the Thirty-first Day of December One thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, or a Memorial of any Will of any Date whatsoever, in which Instrument or 'Will the Barony or Parish in which the Land is situated is not mentioned, then and in that Case, upon the Fact being stated and verified in the Affidavit of the Execution of such Memorial, in what Barony or Parish any Manors, Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments comprised in such Instrument or Will, but of which the Barony or Parish has been omitted to be mentioned, are situated, such Memorial shall in like Manner be registered, and all the like Entries shall be made in the said Register Office, from such Affidavit, in respect of the omitted Barony or Parish, as if such Barony or Parish had been stated in the Instrument or Will and in the Memorial thereof.

XXXI. And be it further enacted, That upon every Memorial brought into the said Office to be registered there shall be indorsed the Number of Grantors, the Number of Denominations of Land, and also the Number of Folios, each of Seventy-two Words, contained in such Memorial, which Indorsement shall be signed by th# Person bringing such Memorial to be registered; and if such Indorsement shall be untrue, the Person subscribing the same shall forfeit Five Pounds, to be recovered, by Civil Bill, by any Officer in the said Registry Office who will sue for the same.

XXXII. And whereas it is convenient that Office Copies of the Memorials registered in the said Register Office should ' under certain Limitations be received in Evidence; be it therefore enacted, That in all Proceedings before any Court of Justice for all Purposes whatsoever, an Office Copy of any Memorial registered in the said Office shall, upon such Office Copy being proved in like Manner as an Office Copy of any other Record, be received and taken as Evidence of the Contents of the Memorial of which it purports to be an Office Copy, without the Production of the original Memorial: Provided always, that the Party producing such Office Copy shall, if out of Dublin Ten Days, and if in Dublin Eight Days before producing the same, give Notice in Writing to the adverse Party thereof; and provided also, that

2° & 3° GULIELMI IV. C. 87.

52a

such adverse Party shall not within Four Days after receiving such Notice demand by a counter Notice that the original Memorial shall be produced; and in every Case in which such counter Notice shall be given, the Costs of producing the original Memorial shall be paid by either Party, as the Court in which the Proceeding shall take place, or the Taxing Officer of such Court, may determine.

XXXIII. And whereas the Indexes or Calendars of the said

Register Office in former Years are many of them in a dilapidated State, and some of the Indexes have been compiled upon an

ineligible Plan; and, for the Benefit of all Persons requiring to make Searches in the said Office in the Years hitherto elapsed, it is very desirable that better and more complete Indexes and that Abstract Books should be prepared of all Memorials registered in the said Office, and to be registered therein, up to and including the said Thirty-first Day of December One tliou- sand eight hundred and thirty-two be it therefore enacted, That like Indexes, and also Abstract Books, as and when the Funds of the Office will permit the same Abstract Books also in respect of such last-mentioned Memorials as by this Act are required with regard to all Memorials to be registered after the said Thirty-first Day of December, shall, as far as the same may be practicable, be constructed, and the same shall be arranged in such Periods as to the Registrar shall seem most convenient and eligible, and in such Manner that when the same shall be completed the whole shall, with the Abstract Books and Indexes of Memorials registered after the said Thirty-first Day of December, form entire and consecutive Sets of Abstracts and Indexes to all Memorials in the said Office, having each Set respectively constructed throughout upon the same Plan.

XXXIV. And for the more expeditiously forming of such Abstracts and Indexes of all Memorials which are and shall be registered in the said Office up to and including the said Thirty-first Day of December, be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Lord High Treasurer, or Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, or any Three or more of them, from Time to Time to order or direct an Appropriation of the Whole or any Part or Parts of all the surplus Receipt of the said Register Office which at the Time of passing this Act shall have been paid into the Bank of Ireland to the Credit of the Consolidated Fund, which shall be necessary for defraying the Expences of compiling, transcribing on Parchment, and completing such Abstracts and Indexes as last aforesaid; and moreover, that the said Lord High Treasurer, or Commissioners of the Treasury aforesaid, shall also be at liberty to order and direct the Appropriation, out of the Balances on the Accounts of the said Registrar in respect of the said Register Office, and before such Balances shall be paid over as herein-before directed, of such further Sum and Sums of Money as may appear to him or them to be requisite for effecting the aforesaid Purpose.

XXXV. And whereas it is of Importance to the Public that the Business of the said Register Office should be carried on with all possible Order, Punctuality, and Dispatch, and also

Indexes to be prepared.

Commissioners of the Treasury may advance Money for defraying the Expence of making Indexes.

that no greater Fees should be charged in the said Office than will amount annually to a Sum of Money sufficient to discharge

the current Expences of the Establishment, when efficiently appointed, and to leave a certain Excess to be applied to the particular Purposes herein-before authorized, and the better to insure that these Purposes shall be effected it is expedient that the said Register Office should be placed under the Controul next herein-after provided; be it therefore enacted, That it shall be lawful for the said Lord High Treasurer, or Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, or any Three or more of them, from Time to Time, as to him or them shall appear needful, or conducive to public Convenience, to regulate the said Register Office, and as well to determine what Number of Persons shall be employed in discharging the Duties to be performed therein, as what the Duty to be performed by each Individual so employed shall be, and likewise to fix the respective Amount of Salary to be paid to each Individual for his Services in the said Office, and, further, to dispense with the Services of all or any One of the Individuals now appointed or employed or hereafter to be employed in the said Register Office, or any Part of such Services, or to reduce the Salary of any such Individual; and in any of the said Cases to make a reasonable Compensation or annual Allowance to such Individual or Individuals, as the said Lord High Treasurer or Commissioners shall deem proper, and to direct the Payment thereof out of the Fees of the said Office, or to authorize the Registrar, in Cases approved of and limited by the said Lord High Treasurer or Commissioners, to make such Advances; and, moreover, to order and direct all or any Part of any Surplus of the Fees and Monies received by the Registrar of the said Office to be laid out or expended in rendering the said Register Office more useful and convenient to the Public, and to reduce, alter, or vary any of the Fees, Regulations, Orders, or Directions established or at any Time hereafter to be established in the said Register Office, and to establish any other Fees, Regulations, Orders, or Directions: Provided always, that every Regulation, Order, or Direction so made or given by the said Lord High Treasurer or Commissioners aforesaid under this Act shall be forthwith laid before both Houses of Parliament, if Parliament shall then be sitting, and if Parliament shall not then be sitting, in that Case within Fourteen Days after the next Meeting of Parliament; and that the same shall not be carried into effect or become and be binding and conclusive until after the End of the Session in which the same shall be so laid before both Houses of Parliament; and also provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to authorize any Reduction of the Salary of the present Registrar, or to alter the Tenure by which the said present Registrar holds his Office.

XXXVI. And be it declared and enacted, That no Person holding the said Office of Registrar of Deeds in Ireland shall be capable of being elected a Member of or of sitting or voting in Parliament.

Labourers are frequently entirely destitute of Work or unprofit- ably employed, and in many Instances receive insufficient ' Allowance for their Support from the Poor Rates: And whereas the Mode of providing Employment for the Poor which may ' be expedient in some Parishes may be inexpedient in others,

and it may therefore be desirable to extend the Powers of ' Parish Vestries in order that such a Course may be pursued as ' may be best adapted to the peculiar Circumstances of each ' Parish: And whereas by an Act passed in the Fifty-eighth ' Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third,

any casual Revenues, either in His Majesty's Foreign Possessions or in the United Kingdom; and that in surrendering His Majesty's Interest in Revenues which had in former Settlements

dence that they would cheerfully provide all that might be ' necessary for the Support of the Civil Government, and the

Honour and Dignity of His Majesty's Crown; His Majesty's

with Hearts full of the warmest Duty and Gratitude, declare ' their Desire that Provision should be made for the Support of the Civil Government by Charges upon the Consolidated Fund,

porting the Honour and Dignity of the Crown of the United Kingdom during His Majesty's Life (whom God long preserve),

might be settled upon His Majesty: And whereas by the said ' recited Act the latter Object was effected, but no Act or Acts

have since passed for making the contemplated Provision for the Civil Government Charges previously borne upon the Civil

List Revenues, upon the Hereditary Revenues of Scotland, and ' upon the Four and Half per Centum Duties, over and above i the Charges provided for by the said recited Act; and such

Charges have from Time to Time been provided for by occa-

the Spirit and Meaning declared in the said recited Act: And whereas it has been deemed expedient that many of the said 1 Charges should be granted from Year to Year upon Estimates ' to be annually prepared for that Purpose: And whereas it is

now deemed expedient to carry into effect the Intentions ' expressed in that Act, by making Provision for other of the ' said Civil Government Charges out of the Consolidated Fund

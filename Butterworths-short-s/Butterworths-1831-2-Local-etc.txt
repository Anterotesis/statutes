502

C.lxxvi.

vantage and Profit than to the general and public Good and Benefit of His City aforesaid, and by no means regarding the

Conservancy of the same River, did with Impunity, and then

daHy, usually sell Coals and other Things of that Sort by Retail in a less Quantity, in Boats commonly called Lighters, and other Vessels, floating, placed, and being in and upon the Water of Thames aforesaid, after the like Coals had been unladen from

the Ships and other Vessels which at first brought the same Coals and other Things of that Sort within the Limits and

Bounds abovesaid, upon the Water of Thames aforesaid, which said Persons made the Boats commonly called Lighters, and other Vessels, as it were their common Shops and Warehouses,

and in the same did daily hold, upon the Water of Thames aforesaid, a common Market for the Sale of the like Coals and other Things of that Sort, having One, Two, Three, and sometimes more Boats commonly called Lighters, and other Vessels, lying and affixed one to the other in the River Thames aforesaid, by which the forestalling, Monopoly, and regrating aforesaid growed and increased every Day, to the great Deception, Loss,

and Oppression as well of the rich as the poor, and the Prices of the Coals and other Things were augmented and rendered dearer; and that by the frequent Importation, carrying away,

measuring, and weighing the like Coals and other Things of that Sort into and out of the same Boats commonly called Lighters,

and other Vessels, a great many of the same Coals and other Filth very often fell and were thrown into the River Thames, to the great Nuisance and choking up of the Stream of the same River, and the aforesaid Boats and other Vessels so placed greatly impeded, as well the Course of the Stream of the River aforesaid as the Passage of those passing by upon the Water

of the same River; His said Majesty therefore, considering it just that so great an Evil ought not longer to be permitted to continue, but should as quickly as possible be put an end to and removed, did firmly order and enjoin, and for Him, His 4 Heirs and Successors, prohibit, all and singular Persons whatsoever, that neither they nor any of them should thenceforth sell nor presume to sell any Coals of any Kind whatever upon the Water of Thames, in any Boat commonly called Lighters,

or in any other Vessel whatsoever, except only in the same Ships or other Vessels which at first brought the like Coals within the Port of the City aforesaid, and within the Limits and Bounds abovesaid, and not otherwise, unless upon some Port, Quay, or Wharf near the River aforesaid, under pain of Contempt of His Royal Command, and of incurring such Pains and Penalties as by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm could be inflicted against the like Offenders for Disregard and Contempt; and because His said Majesty's Intention was that the same Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City aforesaid, and their Successors, should fully enjoy the Premises aforesaid, His said Majesty therefore, by the said Charter now in recital, did declare and signify His Will and Pleasure, and will, and for Him, His Heirs and Successors, grant and agree,

4 to and with the aforesaid Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City aforesaid, and their Successors, that the same Mayor

and

and Commonalty and Citizens of the City aforesaid, and their ' Successors, might securely peacefully, and quietly have,

exercise, enjoy, and use all and singular the Premises above

mentioned, to them and their Successors for ever, without Hindrance of His said Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, or any Officers or Ministers of His said Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, and without making or rendering any Account thereof or any other Thing to His said Majesty, His Heirs and Successors; and if it should happen that any Defect in the said Charter now in recital were thereafter found, or any Doubt,

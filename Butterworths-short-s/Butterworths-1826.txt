An Act to prevent the wilful and malicious Destruction of Dwelling Houses in Ireland.

[26th May 1826*1

WHEREAS divers ill designing and disorderly Persons in

W Ireland have of late wilfully and maliciously committed great Waste and Destruction, by pulling down and demolishing Dwelling Houses and other Buildings whereof they have obtained Possession by virtue or under colour of the Title of some sufficent legal Tenant or Tenants for Lives, with or without a Covenant for Renewal, or for Years, or other less Term, or at Will,

or by Power under or by Collusion with such Tenant or Tenant *

or some Occupier or Occupiers thereof, and have converted and ' disposed to their own Use of the Materials, Fixtures and other Effects arising from or being within or appurtenant to such ' Houses and other Buildings, or used and occupied therewith, to the great Damage of His Majesty's Subjects, being Lessors or ' Owners of such Houses, Buildings and other Property, or other* 4 wise entitled thereto, or interested in the Preservation thereof:

And Whereas the Remedy by Suit in His Majesty's Courts of

Equity to prevent the Commission of such Waste and Destruction is found to be insufficient for the Prevention thereof, by reason that the same may be committed before it is possible to

restrain the Offenders by any equitable Injunction which might be decreed for that Purpose: And Whereas such Waste and Destruction, if once committed, is irreparable, by reason that the Persons so offending are generally Persons in embarrassed or 1 insolvent Circumstances; and inasmuch as Doubts.have arisen

whether, in case such Possession as aforesaid hath been obtained by Consent of the Person or Persons entitled to deliver the same,

the Parties offending can be convicted of any Misdemeanor by any Law now in force within this Realm: And Whereas it is ex* 4 pedient that such Doubts be removed, and some more effectual

Remedy provided than by Law now exists, for the Preservation from Waste and Destruction of Dwelling Houses and other Buildings let to Tenants, and for securing to Landlords and others their just Rights in respect of such Dwelling Houses and other Buildings, Fixtures and Effects within or appurtenant ' to the same, or used and occupied therewith:* Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act all and every Person and Persons who, under Pretence of becoming bona jide Tenant or Tenants of any Dwelling House or other Building, or by Power under or Collusion with any Person or

that the Christian as well as Surnames of all the Witnesses to such Deed, Grant or other Assurance should be inserted in the Memorial thereof in any other manner than as the same may appear subscribed to the Attestation of such Deed, Grant or other Assurance by such Witnesses respectively; and in order to remove such Doubts, 9 Be it enacted and declared by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Con-7 Geo.

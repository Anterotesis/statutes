the Court for his Contempt in not answering, and refuses or neglects to answer, (not being Idiot, Lunatic, or of unsound Mind,) the Court may, upon Motion or Petition, of which due Notice shall be given personally to the Defendant, authorize the Plaintiff to amend his Bill, without such Amendment operating as a Discharge of the Contempt, or rendering it necessary to proceed with the Process of Contempt de novo; but after such Amendment the Plaintiff may proceed to take the amended Bill pro Confesso, in the same Manner as if it had not been amended: Provided nevertheless, that if the Defendant shall be desirous to answer such amended Bill, the Court shall allow him such Time as shall seem just for that Purpose; but if he shall not within the Time allowed by the Court put in a sufficient Answer to the amended Bill, the Process for taking the Bill pro Confesso may be resumed and carried on.

4 amending the Laws relating to Property belonging to Infants, Femes Covert, Idiots, Lunatics, and Persons of unsound Mind, after reciting the said Act, and that it was expedient that the Provisions thereof, which had been so long in force in Ireland,

An Act for preventing the vexatious Removal of Indictments into the Court of King's Bench; ai)d for extending the Provisions of an Act of the Fifth Year of King William and Queen Mary, for preventing Delays at the Quarter Sessions of the Peace, to other Indictments; and for extending the Provisions of an Act of the Seventh Year of King George the Fourth as to taking Bail in Cases of Felony.

[21st August 1835.]

WHEREAS it is expedient to prevent Prosecutors of Indictments and Presentments from vexatiously removing

< the same out of inferior Courts into His Majesty's Court of King's Bench:' Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act no Writ of Certiorari shall issue from the Court of King's Bench at Westminster for removing into that Court any Indictment or Presentment from any Court of Session, Assize, Oyer and Terminer, or Gaol Delivery, or any other Court, at the Instance of the Prosecutor or any other Person (except His Majesty's Attorney General) , without Motion first made in the Court of King's Bench, or before some Judge of that Court, and Leave obtained to remove such Indictment or Presentment, in the same Manner as similar Motions may now be made and Leave given where such Application is made on the Part of Defendants; any Law, Practice, or Usage to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding.

II. And whereas it is expedient to extend the Powers of an Act passed in the Fifth Year of the Reign of King William the 6 Third and Queen Mary, intituled An Act to prevent Delays of ' Proceedings at the Quarter Sessions of the Peace; be it therefore enacted, That instead of the Recognizance now by Law required to be entered into before the Allowance of a Writ of Certiorari, every Person indicted or presented in any Court of Session, Assize, Oyer and Terminer, Gaol Delivery or any other Court, who shall obtain a Writ of Certiorari for removing any Indictment or Presentment whatever into the Court of King's Bench, not being in Custody for Want of Bail to answer such Indictment or Presentment, shall, before the Allowance of such Writ, enter into a Recognizance before One of His Majesty's Justices of the Court of King's Bench, or before a Justice of the Peace of the County or Place in which the Offence is charged to have been committed, or in which such Person shall reside, in such Sum and with such Sureties as the said Court of King's Bench, or One of His Majesty's Justices of the said Court, shall by Indorsement on the

said Writ order and direct; which Recognisance shall contain the same Conditions as are now by the said Act, and another Act passed in the Eighth and Ninth Year of the Reign of King William the Third, intituled An Act to make perpetual and more effectual an Act, intituled ' An Act to prevent Delays at the Quarter Sessions of the PeaceJ required in Cases of Indictments removed from the General or Quarter Sessions of the Peace; and thereupon all the Clauses and Provisions contained in the said several Acts with respect to Costs or otherwise shall extend to such last-mentioned Recognizances; and every Person being in Custody for Want of Bail to answer the Charge contained in such Indictment or Presentment shall be detained in Custody until the like Recognizances as are herein-before directed to be entered into (previous to the Allowance of such Writ of Certiorari) shall have been entered into, or until such Person be discharged by due Course of Law.

III. Whereas in many Cases the taking Bail for the Appear ance of Persons charged with Felony may be safely admitted without endangering the Appearance of such Persons to take their Trial in due Course of Law, and it is therefore expedient ' in such Cases to amend and extend the Provisions in that respect of an Act passed in the Seventh Year of King George the Fourth, intituled An Act for improving the Administration of ' Criminal Justice in England; be it therefore enacted, That it shall be lawful for any Two Justices of the Peace, if they shall think fit, of whom one or other shall have signed the Warrant of Commitment, to admit any Person or Persons charged with Felony, or against whom any Warrant of Commitment for Felony is signed, to Bail, in the Manner and according to the Provisions directed by the said recited Act, in such Sum or Sums of Money and with such Surety or Sureties as they shall think fit, and notwithstanding such Person or Persons shall have confessed the Matter laid to his or their Charge, or notwithstanding such Justices shall not think that such Charge is groundless, or shall think that the Circumstances arc such as to raise a Presumption of Guilt.

An Act to regulate the Admeasurement of the Tonnage and Burthen of the Merchant Shipping of the United Kingdom.

[9th September 1835.]

WHEREAS by an Act passed in the Third and Fourth S&4W. 4. C. 55* c Years of the Reign of His present Majesty, for the re gistering of British Vessels, certain Rules are established for ascertaining the Tonnage of Ships as well on shore as afloat,

' and of Vessels propelled by Steam; and the Account of such ' Tonnage, whenever the same shall have been ascertained ac-

<f0rdlns

C.66.

Rules established by rented Act for ascertaining Tonnage repealed.

The Rule by which Tonnage of Vessels is to be ascertained.

' cording to the Rules therein prescribed (except in the Case ' of Ships admeasured afloat) , it is thereby enacted shall be deemed the Tonnage of such Ships, and snail be repeated in every subsequent Registry of such Ships* unless any Alteration ' shall have been made in their Form and Burthen, or unless it be discovered that the Tonnage had been erroneously computed: And whereas it is considered that the Capacity of a 4 Ship is the fairest Standard by which to regulate its Tonnage, 4 that internal Measurements will afford the most accurate and convenient Method of ascertaining that Capacity, and that the Adoption of such a Mode of Admeasurement will tend to the Interests of the Ship Builder and the Owner, as well as to the proper Collection of the Dues which by Law are payable on Tonnage; and it is expedient to alter and amend the Law 4 in this respectBe it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the Commencement of this Act so much of the said recited Act as establishes Rules for ascertaining the Tonnage of Ships shall be and the same is hereby repealed so far as respects the Merchant Shipping of the United kingdom to be thereafter registered.

II. And be it further enacted, That from and after the Commencement of this Act the Tonnage of every Ship or Vessel required by Law to be registered shall, previous to her being registered, be measured and ascertained while her Hold is clear, and according to the following Rule; (that is to say,) Divide the Length of the Upper Deck between the Afterpart of the Stem and the Forepart of the Stern-post into Six equal Parts. Depths: At the foremost, the middle, and the aftermost of those Points of Division, measure in Feet and Decimal Parts of a Foot the Depths from the under Side of the Upper Deck to the Ceiling at the Limber Strake. In the Case of a Break in the Upper Deck, the Depths are to be measured from a Line stretched in a Continuation of the Deck. Breadths: Divide each of those Three Depths into Five equal Parts, and measure the Inside Breadths at the following Points; videlicet, at One Fifth and at Four Fifths from the Upper Deck of the foremost and aftermost Depths, and at Two Fifths and Four Fifths from the Upper Deck of the midship Depth. Length: At Half the midship Depth measure the Length of the Vessel from the Afterpart of the Stem to the Forepart of the Stern-post; then to Twice the midship Depth add the foremost and the aftermost Depths for the Sum of the Depths; add together the upper and lower Breadths at the foremost Division, Three Times the upper Breadth, and the lower Breadth at the midship Division, and the upper and Twice the lower Breadth at the after Division, for the Sum of the Breadths; then multiply the Sum of the Depths by the Sum of the Breadths, and this Product by the Length, and divide the final Product by Three thousand five hundred, which will give the Number of Tons for Register. If the Vessel have a Poop or Half Deck, or a Break in the Upper Deck, measure the Inside Mean Length, Breadth, and Height of such Part thereof

as

A.D. 1835. 5° & 6° GULIELMI IV. C. 56.

269

as may be included within the Bulk-head; multiply these Three Measurements together, and dividing the Product by 92*4, the Quotient will be the Number of Tons to be added to the Result as above found. In order to ascertain the Tonnage of open Vessels, the Depths are to be measured from the upper Edge of the upper Strake.

III. And be it further enacted, That the Tonnage or Burthen Tonnage to of every Ship belonging to the United Kingdom, ascertained in be entered on the Manner herein-before directed, shall, in respect of any such Register.

[9th September 1835.]

WHEREAS a Treaty was, on the Eighth Day of August in

* the Year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and

thirty-four, with an additional Article thereto on the Eighth

Day of 1December in the same Year, concluded between His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, His Majesty the King of the French, and His Majesty the King of Sardinia, and signed at Turin, whereby it was agreed as follows:

' Article I. — His Majesty the King of Sardinia accedes to the Conventions concluded and signed on the Thirtieth of November One thousand eight hundred and thirty-one and on the Twenty-second of March One thousand eight hundred

the Slave Trade, as well as to their Annexes, excepting the Reservations and Modifications expressed in the Second, 4 Third, and Fourth Articles herein-after given, which Articles shall be considered additional to the said Conventions and to ' their Annexes, and excepting the Differences which necessarily result from the Situation of His Sardinian Majesty as 4 a Party acceding to the Conventions in question after their Conclusion; His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of

Great Britain and Ireland and His Majesty the King of the French having accepted the said Accessions, all the Articles of these Two Conventions, and all the Conditions of their Annexes, shall in consequence be held to have been concluded and signed in the same Manner as the present Convention directly between His Majesty the King of the United ' Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, His Majesty the King of the French, and His Majesty the King of Sardinia:

4 Their said Majesties engage and promise reciprocally to fulfil faithfully, excepting the Reservations and Modifications ' hereby stipulated for, all the Clauses, Conditions, and Obligations which result therefrom; and in order to prevent any

Word for Word, as follows:

Convention between His Majesty and the King of the French for the more effectual Suppression of the Traffic in Slaves, ' signed at Paris the Thirtieth Day of November One thousand eight hundred and thirty-one.

4 The Courts of Great Britain and of France, being desirous of rendering more effectual the Means of Suppression which

have hitherto been in force against the criminal Traffic known under the Name of the Slave Trade, they have deemed it

expedient to negociate and conclude a Convention for the

Attainment of so salutary an Object, and they have to this

End named as their Plenipotentiaries; (that is to say,) His

 Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Right Honourable Viscount Granville, Peer

of Parliament, Member of the Privy Council, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, Ambas-

sador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at the Court of France; and His Majesty the King of the French the Lieutenant General Count Horace Sebastiani, Grand Cross of the

4 2'. All round the Isle of Madagascar to the Extent of Twenty Leagues from that Island.

4 3°. To the same Distance from the Coasts of the Island of Cuba.

4 4°. To the same Distance from the Coasts of the Island of Porto Rico.

4 5°. To the same Distance from the Coasts of Brazil.

4 It is however understood that a suspected Vessel descried and begun to be chased by the Cruizers whilst within the said Space of Twenty Leagues may be searched by them beyond those Limits, if, without having ever lost Sight of her, they should only succeed in coming up with her at a greater Distance from the Coast.

Article II. — The Right of searching Merchant Vessels of either of the Two Nations in the Waters herein-before mentioned shall be exercised only by Ships of War whose

4 Corn-

' Commanders shall have the Rank of Captain or at least that of Lieutenant in the Navy.

Article III. — The Number of Ships to be invested with this Right shall be fixed each Year by a special Agreement; the Number for each Nation need not be the same,

Nation be more than Double the Number of the Cruizers

of the other.

Article IV. — The Names of the Ships and of their Commanders shall be communicated by each of the contracting Governments to the other, and Information shall be reciprocally given of all Changes which may take place in the Cruizers.

Article V. — Instructions shall be drawn up and agreed upon in common by the Two Governments for the Cruizers of both Nations, which Cruizers shall afford to each other mutual Assistance in all Circumstances in which it may be useful that they should act in concert.

Article VI. — Whenever a Cruizer shall have chased and overtaken a Merchant Vessel as liable to Suspicion, the Commanding Officer, before he proceeds to the Search,

4 shall exhibit to the Captain of the Merchant Vessel the special Orders which confer upon him by Exception the Right to visit her; and in case he shall ascertain the Ship's 4 Papers to be regular, and her Proceedings lawful, he shall certify upon the Log Book of the Vessel that the Search took place only in virtue of the said Orders; these Formalities having been completed, the Vessel shall be at liberty to continue her Course.

Article VII. — The Vessels captured for being engaged in the Slave Trade, or as being suspected of being fitted out for that infamous Traffic, shall, together with their Crews, be delivered over, without Delay, to the Jurisdiction of the Nation to which they shall belong; it is furthermore distinctly understood, that they shall only be judged according to the Laws in force in their respective Countries.

Article VIII. — In no Case shall the Right of mutual Search be exercised upon the Ships of War of either Nation.

4 The Two Governments shall agree upon a particular Signal, with which those Cruizers only shall be furnished which are invested with this Right, and which Signal shall not be made known to any other Ship not employed upon this Service.

Article IX. — The High Contracting Parties to the present Treaty agree to invite the other Maritime Powers to accede to it within as short a Period as possible.

4 which should happen after the Death of the Contributor, and so on regularly during the natural Life of the Widow and her remaining unmarried, or until the youngest surviving Child of such Contributor should attain the Age of Sixteen Years complete, whichever of these Events should happen the latest;

4 provided that the Widows and Children of Contributors under

the said Royal Charter or Letters* Patent not acceding to the Scheme under the said recited Act were to be paid Annuities only at the former limited Rates under the said Royal Charter

or Letters Patent, and to continue to Children only until the youngest of such Children should attain the Age of Twelve

Years, as provided by the said original Patent; and in order to render the Funds thereby established sufficient and suitable for answering the several Purposes of the said Act, Power was thereby given to raise a Capital Fund or Stock, proportioned to the Number of Contributors, according to certain Rules and Regulations in the said Act contained; and it was amongst other Things further provided, that as soon and so often as the said Stock should amount to the Capital Sum therein described and limited, in proportion to the Number of Contributors, the Surplus, which might be found above that Amount upon balancing the Accounts ending at the Fifth Day of July annually should be set apart and applied by the Managers of the Incorporation at the Time in such Portions as they should judge best, for aug *

4 menting the Annuities to the Widows and Children of the Contributors proportionably, such Augmentation not to exceed the One Half of the ordinary Annuity payable to each Annuitant;

4 and in case of any Surplus beyond what should be judged necessary for making such Augmentation within the Limit aforesaid, Power is given to the Managers to apply such further Surplus towards paying the Annuities in the succeeding Year,

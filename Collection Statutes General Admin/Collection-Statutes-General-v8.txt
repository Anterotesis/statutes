(the impropriety of this principle is extremely manifest, and was always gfytelt by the profession. Lofld Kenyon, in one of his earliest decisions, . ia incidental opportunity to express his protest against it. But the tkad previously advanced so far as to establish, that such property, if We, must be local, visible property, within the parish; Andover Coo-550: and shortly afterwards the question was brought very extensively a the Court, by the case of the King ©. White, 4 T.

What personal property rateable; what not.

) In pursuance of the above principles it has been decided, in R. r. i8 East, 4.M, that an inhabitant of Holyhead was rateable to the poor i, for a packet boat employed in carrying the mail to Ireland, provided bit his own expense, ana registered elsewhere.

in been held that an attorney is not rateable for his fees and profits; Shrtifant, M. 37 G. 3.

[tjStock in trade is only rateable if productive, and it is for the ses-i to determine that fact, and also the amount of the rate; and, therefore, to die sessions quash a rate for not including stock in trade, which they Isaght to be rated, without finding more; as, whether it produced pro-liable to incumbrances equal to the value: the order of sessions ►•ttuide, as not sufficiently disclosing facts to enable the Court to draw eadusiou, that the persons omitted ought to have been rated, although fcieid that the bare possession of personal property was evidence from i the justices might have drawn the conclusion, that the possessor should fed; U.e. Dureslv, 6 T. R.53. In the case of Darlington, 6 T. R. 468, kfound, that certain persons (the not charging of whom in the rate for lb trade, was thegrouadof appeal) kept shops, and possessed a visible fh trade, and appeared to carry on business to the same extent as in the Pfegyear, when they paid the rate; but that their circumstances or fcor that they made profit of their stock in trade, or that it was exclu-JbUirirdebts, or a clear residue alter debts paid, did not appear; and part of B.

Sir A. Macdonald, 12 East, 324.

[The real point upon which the sessions decided this < which the editor was counsel, was, not that the evidence wa ficient to shew that the property was productive generally, I it did not go to prove the sums in particular tor which t ought to have been made; and this, iu fact, appears to bei perable difficulty attached to the subject, whenever the qw fairly contested.

It may also be observed, that when a rate is objected to, including particular persons, liable in respect of personal esta due notice is given to those persons, and the case is sul made out to affect them, they are reasonably entitled to ol the amendment of the rate, by including a charge against thei there are others in the same situation to whom the notice been given, and who, therefore, cannot be included; wher amendment may have a partial and unequal operation, and therefore, be unjust.

The consequences which may arise from this considerate the practical difficulties which necessarily attend the ratio* sonal property if contested, compared to the smallness of vantage which can result from ft, may possibly be a matter cient consideration to the Legislature, as furnishing ground moving the liability altogether.]

In the case of Amblesidc, 16 E. 380, the sessions quashed the rate including personal property; and the Court of Ring*s Bench setai order of sessions, because they onght to have amended the rate, by vi the power in st. 41 Geo.

Bot be observed, that the statute expressly provides, that if the sessions I of opinion that it is necessary, for the purpose of giving relief to the or persons appealing, that the rate should be wholly quashed, then t court may quash the same.

[Lord Kenyon said, “ It might have been contended below that he was not occupier in the legal sense of the word, yet the finding of the sessions precluded that question.”—This is one of the nnmeroos instances which occur in the books of catching at a word, and giving the go-by to the real question intended to be submitted. Ike sessions, of course, intended to reserve a case upon the particular I facts; and the statement that tlid party was occupier, is no more than is implied in the confirmation of the rate. And in the subsequent case of King v. Field, 5 T. R. 591. above referred to, it being urged that the sessions had stated the appellant was occnpier. Lord Kenyon said, it was not so stated as a fact, that the Court could not deliberate upon it, but as a point upon which the sessions desired to have their opinion.] barrack master, there being several apartments beyond what were hary for regimental business, in which he resided with his family; M, 3 East, 506.

[In this case the aothorities bearing upon the subject were very *

> fully examined, and Lord EUenborough laid down the general doctrines respecting it as follows(“ The principle is, that if the party I have the use of the building, or other subject of the rate, as a mere servant of the crown, or of any public body, or in any other respect, for the mere exercise of public duty therein, and have no beneficial occupation of, or emolument resulting from It, in any personal and private respect, then he is not rateable. The property of the crown,

1 in the beneficial occupation of a subject, whether he be a civil or a military officer, is equally rateable. But if the use of a residence upon the property be either as the servant of the crown, and for public purposes only, or as a mere public officer or servant, or of any other description, the parties having the use of the property merely for such purposes, are not rateable; because the occupation is throughout that of the public, and of which public occupation the individuals are only the means and instruments.”] la WUtord r. Copland, 3 Bos. and Pull. 129, it was ruled, that the masters daoccry were not liable to be rated under a local Act, for the rooms used

ten for the purooses of their office, in the public building appropriated t purpose. The case was regarded as depending upon the same prin-b with the rateability to the poor. Lord Alvanley delivered an elaborate (pent, in the course of which he incidentally observed (with reference to >thad passed on a former occasion), that “ it was difficult to conceive it (be residence of a porter, who had the care of the whole building, could ke estli master rateable for his own apartment.”

4 [8] In the case of the Governor and Company for Smelting Lead e. Richardson, 3 Bur. 1311, it was ruled, that lead mines were not rateable; the Court inferring (with what degree of reason it is not material to examine), that the expression of coal mines in the statute of Elisabeth, excludes mines of any other sort as mucli as if they had been excepted.

The case has been followed as an authority ever since, and accordingly a rate on “ iron and coal mines” was quashed; Cunningham, 5 Hast, 478.

OF RELIEF AGAINST POOR RATES BY APPEAL OR AC

$ [14] If a person, not having rateable property within the pari* trained upon for a poor rate, it seems clear that he has a remedy I of trespass; a great many of the cases respecting rateability havi upon such actions.

In other cases the remedy must be by appeal.

The sessions are exclusively the judges of the quantum or value oi property; and it is for them to decide whether lands and buildingi rated in the same or different proportions; Brograve, 4 Cur. *491 Caldcc. 93; Sandwich, Caldcc. 103.

But if the sessions state a principle of rating which is contrary t< not rating improvements), the Court of B. R. may give relief; Mast. 61

The rate should be at the present improved value, without regu rent; . C. and Shingle, 7T.R. 549.

A third person cannot appeal on the ground of one person bsi rather than another, for other property (the property itself being full] Semble, Rex r. Brown, 8 E. 5*8.

Upon an appeal, the respondents mnst support the rate, both as tc and amount; Topham, 12 E. 546.

Formerly, if a rate was objected to on account of any person being or under-rated, it could not be amended; and, if objectionable, nfl been quashed. But the law, in this respect, is altered by stat 41 C C. 23.

OF SETTLEMENTS AND REMOVALS.

The law of settlements is perhaps one of the strongest instances which can he cited of numerous ramifications and distinctions, of which a very few apparently plain and simple propositions may be susceptible. A foil and enlarged view of this subject is taken in several respectable publications, sufficiently familiar to the profession; but I conceive the most useful and satisfactory is that which is contained in Burn, to the later editions of which, however, it may reasonably be stated as an objection, that they retain at full length a great number of cases, some of which establish upon discussion points which may now be regarded as first principles of the subject, and others of which have long been overruled, and are become completely obsolete.

In the compressed view of the subject which is consistent with the compass of a note, I shall take for granted, without any citation of authorities, those leading rules and principles which are so familiar, that no person in the course of practice' would think it necessary to adduce any authority in support of them; referring only by name to those cases which may require a more particular attention. This is the more admissible, as the authorities, through the medium of the publications above alluded to, are of such perfect facility of access; and in order to promote that facility still further, I shall adopt the arrangement of the last edition of the work already mentioned.

It should always be remembered as a preliminary consideration, that the system is primarily founded upon the modifications of the original and subsisting statute of the 43d. EUz. c. 2. (ante No. 1.) which provides •relief for the persons therein enumerated, and .who may be designated generally as the poor.

Under this statute relief was to be applied to persons who were the objects of it, by the parish in which they might happen to be; but, for the reasons stated in the statute 13 & 14 Ch. II. c. 12., it was enacted, that within forty days after any poor person coming to settle in any tenement under 101. a-year, they might be removed to the place where they were last legally settled, for the space of forty days at the least, either as a native householder, sojourner, apprentice, or servant.

The term of forty days was, by subsequent statutes of 1 Jac. II. c. 17. s.3. 3 and 4 W. and M. c. 11. restrained to cases of a notice being given in writing, and published in the church, subject to certain qualifications contained in the latter statute, which should render such notice unnecessary, and which, being accompanied with the primary quality of a residence of forty days prescribed by the statute of Charles, should be considered as equivalent. To the several Acts and qualifications so introduced, together with the circumstance mentioned in the statute of Charles, of occupying a tenement of the yearly value of 101. the courts of law applied the term gaining a settlement, ana have superadded by analogy, real or supposed, other cases, to which a similar effect should be given.

41

bss XXVIII.] Poor.

he expression jnst referred to, of gaining a settlement, is a striking illusion of the power of language over opinions; for although nothing ir pe obvious to the slightest attention, than that the advantage of a settle-it in one parish or another, must, as regards the object of it, depend upon-lateral and accidental circumstances, the change of settlement was regard-is an advantage, and a reward for some meritorious conduct; and in ctfn-•eoce of that impression, every ingenuity has been exercised to construe [statutes in such a manner as that parties should not be deprived of the rite which they had such an interest to acquire; and although the fallacy hr opinion is now pretty generally admitted, the effect of it upo*i the sys-Isflaw still continues to operate, and very rightly so, in supporting a conation, the original justice and propriety of which, in mgpy instances, was test extremely dubous. In all cases where no parish can be found to-ich a removal can be made under the authority of the statute of Charles,

: original obligation upon the parish where the party may happen to be, continues.

emerits are either original or derivative; the first arising either by ior the several qualifications introduced by statute, to which the courts r have added the ownership of an estate; the second consisting of the ment which a wife derives from the husband, by which her own presettlement is destroyed, and that which children derive from their its, until they have acquired a settlement of their own. la all the cases included in the first division, except that of birth, the pri-pj qualification of the statute of Charles, a residence of forty days is in-pjaably requisite; and the effect of this qualification upon the settle-met, when there has been a variety or succession of residences, depends m the place of passing the last night during the continuance of the meter or relation from which the settlement is derived, accompanied a preceding residence to the amount of thirty-nine nights in the whole, 1 without any teference to the interval which may have elapsed between i last night and any of the preceding ones; but in the case of a servant, party must have passed these forty nights in the compass of a year; 4am, 1 M. and . Ml: see post, title Apprenticeship, as to what shall be Red the last night.

he language of most of the cases is, that the settlement is where the Itj sleeps the last night, but in the case of Ringwood, 1 M. and . 381., was held that the rule was satisfied by passing the last night in packing goods, without going to bed, and that what will satisfy pernoctavit is kient.

Previous to the statute of 35 Geo. III. c. 101., a poor person was liable be removed, as being likely to be chargeable. As might therefore natu-b be expected, no cases occiit of settlement by notice in writing, as such lice would immediately, wherever it was practicable, have been followed a removal: but this statute having confined the power of removal to the k of persons actually chargeable, it likewise abolished the settlement by

t, which would have enabled any person to choose a settlement at his

Certain restrictions upon the power of removal, and also of th$ power of raining a settlement, were introduced in the case of certificates, which the ht-mentioned statute has rendered comparatively unimportant, but which [il be duly noticed.

Section I.—Settlement by Birth.

Settlement by birth is divided into the two cases of bastards^ and legitime children; in each case birth is a fact which must be proved in the same aner as any other, by positive or circumstantial evidence:reputation or Rasay is not admissible evidence upon the subject; Erith, 8 East, 539.

Bastards are necessarily settled where born, except in the cases of

1. Fraud. As when the mother is persuaded by the parish in which she is Mtled, to go to lie-in in another; but this exception does not apply where ie is persuaded to leave a parish iu which she is not settled j Masters e. kid, 3 Salk. 66.

[Query, whether this exception can now apply; the statute 33 G. protects members of friendly societies from being removejl until actually chargeable. The statute 35 Geo. HI. c. lot. protects all persons in genera! from being removed until actually chargeable, and declares that a single woman, being with child, shall be deemed actually chargeable; and it is clear that no persons are protected from removal by the former statute, who are subject to it by the latter; vid. ante. Title Friendly Societies.]

10. — ----when the mother is in a lying-in hospital; or

11. —— ----— comes with a certificate expressly acknowledging her

to be pregnant.

But that exception does not extend to a child bom at a subsequent period;

Mathon, 7 T. R. 362.

In all die above cases the settlement is with the mother, except that with respect to the 5th, it seems to be in the removing parish.

When the mother, by desire of the overseers of the parish to which she belonged, went in search of the person by whom she was with child, and was unexpectedly delivered in another parish, diere being no fraud, the settlement follows the birth; Asdey, 2 Bott. 10.

A legitimate child, if neither the father or mother have a settlement which is known, is settled at the place of birth.

It is said, Dalt. 168, Comb. 364, 372, that a child must be sent to where it was first knotfn to be, if no other settlement is known; but this seems very doubtful, and I have never known it acted upon.

Section II.—Settlement by Parentage.

A legitimate child follows the settlement of its father, or if none such is known, that of its mother, and continues to follow the change of such settlement, except in the case of the mother acquiring a new settlement by a second marriage, until emancipation.

Emancipation is the term (borrowed with some impropriety from the civil law) applied to children who no longer follow the settlement of their parents. The cases of it, as enumerated by Lord Kenyou, have always been decided on the circumstances, either

1. Of the son’s being 21; or

2. Married; or

3. Having gained a settlement in his own right; or

4. Having contracted a relation inconsistent with the idea of being

in a subordinate situation in his father’s family.

1. The mere attaining 21 is not an emancipation; but if after the age of pupilage a child sever himself from his father’s family, |ie cannot a tier wards be incorporated with it. In the principal cases the pauper was emancipated by going out for eight weeks as a wet-nurse; Roach, 6 T. R. 247. A daughter who, at the age of eleven, went with her father’s consent to live with a relation, and continued with him until after twenty-one, was held to be thereby emancipated; Cowhoneyburnc, 10 E. 88.

2. Marriage is universally an emancipation, notwithstanding a continued residence with the parents; Everton, 1 East, 526.

3. In the case of a person under age, there is no emancipation by an apprenticeship under a void indenture, a hiring and service for a year to a certificated person, or other act of a similar nature, unless a settlement is actually gained; Edgeworth, 3 T. R. 254; Wilton, 3 T. R. 355; Coljingburu Duels, 4T. R. 199.

4. Inlisting as a soldier: but Q. in case the party returns when under age; which case does not appear ever to have been decided: and see the case of Roach, supra 1.

Conformably with the above principles, a child is not emancipated by

1. Following business on his own account; continuing to live with his mother; Sowerby, 2 East, 276.

2. Serving in the militia; Woburn, 8 T. R. 479.

. C. 806.

k Residing under age with a relation or other person; Tottington Lower P, Cald. 284; Offchurch, 3 T. R. 114.

Section III.~Marriage.

A wife in all cases takes her husband’s settlement. If the husband has no pfement, or such settlement is unknown, the wife’s original settlement conga*. Birth, or any other settlement of the wife in any parish, throws the

jkvprobandi of the husband's settlement in some other specific place on kh parish.

N. B. There is a series of cases in Burn as to the evidence of birth, I legitimacy, bastardy, and marriage; but the evidence of those facts

\ is not different as applied to settlements, from what it is in other

cases wherein they may come in question.

1 Section IV.—Hiring and Service.

Hy 1, 3 and 4W. and M. c. 11, § 7, if any unmarried person, not having mMy shall be lawfully hired into any parish for one year, such service shall ta settlement; 8 and 9 W. c. 30.

An absence by reason of illness does not prevent the settlement, altliong the servant does not return, and is incapable of returning, to his master, a where he became a lunatic, and was taken to his father's; Sutton, 5T. R 657.

[Per Lord Kenyon—The settlement is where he was last in th service; but this point does not arise in the case, and the otbe judges gave no opinion on it.—Ruled to be so in case of apprentice ship; Barm by in the Marsh, 7 E. 383.

Nor a commitment to the house of correction on the complaint of the mas ter, for an offence in his service, the servant returning after his liberation and staying to the end of the year: wages were deducted for the time he wa! in confinement; Barton upon Irwell, 2 M. and . 329.

But a servant apprehended on a charge of bastardy a few days before Uu end of his year, a deduction being made from his wages, and never return ing, does not gain a settlement; Hartley «. Westmeon, Cald. 129.

A dismissal for a reasonable cause, as of a female servant for being witl child, is a dissolution of the contract, and defeats the settlement; Ashovei

e. Brampton, Cald. 11.

But there is no dissolution,

1. If the master before the end of the year tnrns the servant out of doors, to prevent his gaining a settlement; Eastland v, Westhorsley, 1 Str. 526.

2. Where the master refused to allow the servant to return, after an absence for a reasonable cause; Gresham, 1 T.R. 101.

3. When the master, a short time before the end of the year, for an insuffi' cient cause turned away the servant, who was willing to stay, and returned the next day for her clothes-, and received the wages offered to her as the full amount of what she was entitled to as a year’s wages, but leas than she demanded, (there being a dispute as to the amount) and offered to stay to the end of the year; Hardhorn with Newton, 12 E. 51.

Cases of Dissolution and Dispensation by express Agreement.

These are very numerous and seemingly very irreconcileable.—In the case of Thistleton, 6 T. R. 185, Lord Kenyon laid down the principle as follows:—“ If the pauper be absent from the service with the concurrence, remaining, however, subject to the controu! of his master, he may acquire a settlement, because this only amount! to a dispensation with his service; but if the master has once parted with his controul over the servant, there no settlement is gamed, and the receiving the whole year’s wages does not make any difference.”

The application of this plain and distinct principle will certainly overturn many of the cases, in which it has been held that there was only a dispensation.

In some of the later cases, however, cited infrd, and which have been decided since the preparing this note, the Court of B. R. has given full effect to the application of the principle, in opposition to the finding of the sessions. —See particularly Rex v. Bury, infri. II. 11.

6. Eight days before the end of the term, upon some difference, the ser-natgave her mistress warning that she would quit her service at the end of [He term; the mistress, on having hired another servant, discharged her, and pidher the full wages, which she accepted, and quitted the service; but said.

3.

“ It seems to me, that when the parties stand in such a situation, that neither the master can compel the servant to come back to his service, nor the servant can compel the master to take him back, and neither of them has any legal means of compelling redress against the other, there is a dissolution of the contract.”

4. The pauper being too ill to do his work, the master paid him his hole vear’s wages, when he left his master’s service and went to a hospital; Sudbroke, 4 E. 356.

There was conflicting deuce as to the master having said, that if tke other man did not suit b he would make the pauper serve his time out. The sessions had found case to be a dissolution, and in effect discredited the pauper’s evidence to such conversation; Mildenhall, 12 E. 432.

10. Two days before the end of the year (the servant being married that day) the master consented to the servant leaving his service, and p him the whole year’s wages the servant hired himself next day to anotl master. The sessions had found the case to be a dissolution. Le Blanc held that they would have been warranted in finding a dissolution:the otf Judges held it a dissolution, not relying on the sessions having found it to such. Lord Eilenborough—“ I should have been sorry, in any case, to hi originated the question of dispensation, but it has been established to a c taiu extent, ana so far let it stand; but I will not extend it further.” “ The master contented to his servant leaving: I know not in what stroni terms a servant could plead to an action for leaving service.

Section V.—Op Apprenticeship.

To constitute a contract of apprenticeship there must necessarily be deed, and according to stat. 5 Elizabeth, it should be an indenture; but X 31 Geo. II. c. 11. the being indented is unnecessary so far as regards tl question of settlement.

By statutes 8 Anne, c. 9. and 9 Anne, c. 21. a duty of 6d. in the pound fi 501. or under, and of 12d. for every pound above, of money, or other thin| not money, according to their value, is imposed on indentures of appro ticeship, except money given with parish apprentices, or by or out of puM charities.

Many cases arose upon the point, whether the duty was payable in cas of a covenant by the father or other relation to maintain the apprentice which were decided upon their particular circumstances, and the genen

auestion was as much as possible avoided, until the case of Leighton, 41 :. 732, in which it was decided that no such duty is payable; the op non of the court being, upon a full consideration of the subject, that the ol ligation of providing tor apprentices did not result from the mere relation < master and apprentice.

An agreement by the apprentice to allow two shillings a 'week out i wages to be paid by the master, does not require, a stamp; Bradford, l Jty and . 151.

|b» XXVIIIO Poor.

A voluntary annual subscription for putting out children apprentices is a falic charity; also money left by will; Clifton, B. 8. C. 697. litis not necessary that a parish indenture should be executed either by b master or the apprentice.

[An indenture of apprenticeship of an audit, not executed by him, is void; faer, 9 East, 295.

An execution by the master, in cases of private indentures, does not seem hbt essential: no execution by the master was proved in the case of Rib-inter, 9 M. and . 135; and the only point contested was as to what place [iifcst night of service should be referred to.

I fte length of time for which the apprentice is bound is immaterial.

\ In the case of a parish indenture, the indenture must be executed by the tajor part of the churchwardens and overseers.—See as to this subject Kbl 43. Eliz. c. 2, ante No. 1. note 23. See also Title Apprentices, No. Cl5.

k Such an indenture must be allowed by two justices of the peace. Their bwance at different times is not valid; but if he who has already signed is meat at and privy to the signature of the other, it is sufficient; Winwick, f. R. 445.

When the justices having refused to allow a binding, and the overseer pith the pauper and his mother retired to an inn, and there the pauper with he consent of his mother bound himself to the same person, and the overseer pid the premium before agreed upon, it was ruled that the binding was pW, and that the sessions were not warranted in finding it fraudulent; 1%, 2 M. and . 501.

V great subject of litigation in modern cases has been the principle, that f extract intended as an apprenticeship, and imperfect as such, shall not fare as a service.

This first occurred in Salford t>. Storeford, 2 Bott. 363, where the instruct which purported to be an indenture of apprenticeship was not stamped:ti several other cases of a similar nature occurred previous to the case or ttle Bolton, Cald. 367, in which the pauper asked the master to teach him weave; the master agreed to do so if he would work with him three vs, the earnings to be divided between them, and an agreement in wri-gwas entered into accordingly. The court first thought that this was an prentfceship, as the pauper was to be taught; but afterwards Lord nriield said, upon looking into the authorities, that all those cases of prenticeship which had been holden to be defective, and were not con-itible into services, spoke of the pauper as an apprentice, and that he u to serve as such.

la the case of Highnam, 2 Bott. 371, which immediately followed, the per went for the purpose of being an apprentice, and paid four guineas; t, to save the expense of the indenture and duty, they agreed to sign an agree-ent on unstamped paper: it was held to be clear that a fraud was intended, d therefore that no settlement was gained by service.

Subsequent to this, a pauper agreed to serve seven years as on apprentice, m so agreement was signed, and it was held not to be a service; Margram, L 193.

Ike pauper clubbed with the master, which was to be taught a trade, to Rrv« three years at progressive wages; he was to do any work the master set fa shout; and this was ruled to be a service. Lord Kenyon thought the l fact decisive; Coltishall, 5 T. R. 195.

Thus stood the authorities upon the subject previous to the case of Lain *, fa, 8 T. R. 379; and it seemed to be considered as a settled point, than an freement to serve on the one band and to instruct on the other was to be Igarded as a valid service, and not as an imperfect apprenticeship, unless e express agreement was that the party should serve as an apprentice, or less there was an actual intention of defrauding the revenue by the eva- of the stamp duty.

11st in the case of Laindon, there being a written agreement that the faper should serve for three years, to learn a trade at certain wages, with ifnof by parol that at the time of signing the agreement the pauper agreed I give three guineas as a premium, which sum was partly paid, and partly, fared in the amount of wages, and that be was not to be employed in any far work than that of a carpenter; the contract was held to be invalid as I imperfect apprenticeship.—The following is the material part of Lord knyon’s judgment upon the subject.

iu When it is urged that this relation can only be found by using the term (rnhei, it may be observed that the argument would lead to an absurd Tot. VIII. E

consequence; for then, if the word clerk were used in regular indent or apprenticeship, the clerk would not gain a settlement by serving uudei indenture, merely because he was not retained eo nomine as an apprem But it would be a disgrace to our laws if we were obliged to decide ac< ing to words without considering their meaning. It was properly sai Lord Hardwicke, that there if no magic in words §; and he said this, n< a discovery just then made by him, but as a maxim which was handed «# to him from his predecessors. If the relation of master and servant ia ated by the contract of the parties, though they do not use the very w< tantamount, it is sufficient. In this case a premium was paid by one i to another, who engaged to teach him a trade: now, what is that but an prenticcship ? The term apprentice is from the French word apprendre learn. Unfortunately, Lord Mansfield did not adhere to his first opinio the case of Little Bolton: but even when he gave his second opinion in case, he took it for granted that the rule remained unshaken, but if the ties intended to create the relation of master and apprentice, and it v not legally created, so that the apprentice could not gain a settlcmen: such, he could not acquire a settlement as a yearly servant. And in subsequent case of Highnam, Lord M. adopted the opinion he had first gi in the case of Little Bolton, conformably to all the other cases. Therel we may rely upon this last case, and if it be not distinguishable from tha Little Bolton, it is sufficient to say that it is subsequent to it, and that case of Little Bolton is an anomalous case. Where we find the curren authorities one way, I should be sorry that a little inadvertence in the cc in the decision of one case only should be supposed to break in upon the neral.rule; for the case of Coltisliall is distinguishable from this clast cases; there, by the agreement of the parties, the pauper was to do:work the master set him about: and 1 think that we should do infinite x chief if we were to overturn that which has long been a settled rule.”—]

J. Lawrence, after expressing his opinion to the same effect, observed, I “ it was much to be lamented that settlement cases should be determined nice distinctions; it would be better to decide them on some general n that every person who reads can understand it.”

In the subsequent case of Rainham, 1 E. 531, an agreement by deed forparty to teach and the other to learn, with certain wages, was held to giv settlement by apprenticeship: but the question between service and appr ticeship in that case did not precisely occur, for there was a service of m than a year; therefore, quacunque via, $c., if the service had been less tl a year, the distinction would have been material.

This case was soon followed up by that of Eccleston, 2 E. 230, in wh the contract was in the precise terms of the case of Little Bolton, and settlement was held to be gained by service; Lord Ellenborough declai that he gave a reluctant assent to the case of Little Bolton, but as the c was in terms the same, he thought it better to abide by that determinal than to introduce uncertainty into that branch of the law; it being oftei more importance to have the rule settled than to determine what it sho be. He was not, however, convinced by the reasoning of that case, am the point were new he should think otherwise. After stating the rea* upon which he concurred with Lord K. his lordship added, “ however, Lord K. did not think proper to over-rule the case of L. B. in terms, and it was not overruled in the case of Highnam or Rainham, for the reason at first gave, he thought it better to concur in that decision, however unv ling he should have been to have done so in the first instance.”

And lastly, in the case of Shinfield, 14 E. 541, the pauper, after hiring a year, during the continuance of that year signed an agreement with ' same master, to serve him for three years, to learn him to make brick, condition of the master finding him meat and clothes. The mother of 1 pauper proved that the master had asked her if she had any objections to I son being apprenticed to him; and she said no. It was ruled that a sett ment was acquired by service: the case was decided upon a quacunqne for, that, if the second contract was invalid, there was nothing to do aw the former contract/of hiring for a year. But three of the judges express stated their opinion, that the second contract was a contract of servii Lord Ellenborough said, that with respect to the case of Little Bolton, I court in the case of Eccleston considered it a subsisting authority, whate* question there might have been upon the subject at first; and he thought t convenience of the thing was in support of it, M. J. Le Blanc, upon t authorities of the written instrument itself:—“ I do not think that it is to taken as a contract of apprenticeship. In all the former cases where t

51

(ass XXVIII.] Poor.

rtrumeot in question has been so construed, it has been stated that the rties intended to contract in the relation of master and apprentice, only tj had contracted informally in order to avoid the stamp duties; but here t contract is for L. to serve P. to learn the trade; P. finding him in board, L There is no contract for the Master to teach him, but only for the boy teve the opportunity of learning the business/ '

[It would be very dangerous from this doctrine to draw any incidental inferences as to the want of obligation of a party contracting under similar terms; for the real intention of the parties, I that the pauper should be taught by the master, is sufficiently apparent; and whenever that is the case, the obligation attaches to carry such intention inlo execution, however informally it may have been expressed.]

1 [Since writing the preceding part of this note, it has been decided in R. v. Bur bach, 1 M. and . 370, that an agreement made by the father with a frame-work knitter, and assented to by the son, that the son should work for two years, and have what he got, i paying a weekly sum for learning the business, and for the use and standing of a frame, was a service and not an imperfect apprenticeship.]

Upon the whole view of this subject, which, in the course of my observain of the practice of the quarter-sessions, has produced more litigation than Wj other, (although the cow tenements are bidding fair to rival it), it may, llconceive, be now fairly inferred, that a contract for the one party to Me, and for the other to teach a trade, is a contract of service, and not a Ihetive apprenticeship, unless (after all the railing at the King and Little torn) the term apprentice is actually mentioned in the contract; or unless pramum* is given for the instruction; in which cases the contract is void, ifess invested with all the requisites of a valid apprenticeship.

[The maxim that there is no magic in words, which is often pronounced with such imposing solemnity, has always appeared to xnc to have more sound than meaning.

I apprehend that there is no word which has so absolute and technical a sense that it may not be qualified and controuled by the context and the nature of the subject to which it is applied: although there are many cases in the law, in which certain technical words arc essentially necessary to produce a certain legal effect, and many others in which the usual import affixed to a particular expression can only be controuled by matter of absolute and necessary inference to the contrary; and whoever has contemplated with general views our cumbrous mass of cases upon the construction of wills, must be satisfied of the advantage to the community in lessening litigation, and giving certainty to titles by adhering to known and precise rules of construction, in preference to wandering into the regions of conjecture in search of an intention as deduced from expressions, which the party who used them in all probability never dreamed of, as indicating the intention inferred from them; especially as the system adopted is neither purely technical, nor purely matter of construction upon the actual intention, but a kind of unmeaning and unsettled compound of the two. In matters of a positive nature, in which, upon principle, the preference of one course or another is a “priori indifferent, the great criterion of excellence is clearness and certainty, and therefore in cases of this description, the more technical the course which is adopted, the more beneficial are in general the consequences. It is otherwise in matters when there is a principle of propriety arising out of the nature of the subject, in which the accidental forms of language should rather he considered as subordinate to the intention and purposes of the parties; particularly in the case of contracts, and in which a refusal to deviate from the strict and dictionary sense of the tenus, in opposition to the unambiguous intention, is a violation of the superior principles of justice.

This has always most forcibly appeared to me to be the case with respect to the decision in Jones v. Brierly, 1 £. 1. in which it was held that an agreement to pay a per centage upon any Money which the defendant should receive, though the plaintiffs informa£

The statute 9 Anne, c. 9. imposes the duty on all sums paid in relation to any clerk, apprentice or servant a, to learn any profession, trade or employment.

Poor. [Part VI.

tion did not extend to the transfer of stock (stock not being money) z for no fair and reasonable doubt conld be entertained that In this contract the term Motf ey was used as importing property. The court animadverted upon the immorality of the bargain in question, and probably gave a construction different from that which they would have done if the contract had been of a more favourable nature: but that objection should have'gone for every thing or for nothing, and the case, though founded upon that decision, which, next to a mere opinion at Nisi Prius, is or all others the least satisfactory, the refusal upon sudden impulse to grant a rule to shew canse will hereafter stand recorded as a precedent in the way of any claim, however meritorious, resting upon a similarity of circumstances in point of expression. In the famous case of Haycraft r. Creasy, 2 £.92. the defendant, who was charged with giving E. H. a false character, said he knew she was a lady of fortune: that he said so under a full impression that she was so, from facts which he regarded as conveying absolute knowledge, and by which he wan himself deluded—was an adiqitted fact in the case: but Lord Kenyon, from the mere literal application of the word knew, would have fixed upon him the character of frand; and it is well known that he felt great dissatisfaction with the other judges, who, fortunately for the true principles of justice, were of a different opinion.

In the case of Shinfield, (the last case in the text to which this note is attached:I am quite aware with bow much digression) Mr. Justice Le Blanc adverts to the true ground upon which the class of cases under discussion originated; but from which, in the progress of the taw, there has been a considerable deviation; and has shewn that it was merely a question of revenue, and arising from an intention to avoid the stamp laws.

At common law, a contract that one party shall serve another, who shall in retorn instruct him in the business, in which the service is to be performed, (which instruction is commonly the mere effect and consequence of the service) is in its nature as open and unexceptionable as any other of the numerous contracts which parties may enter into, with a view of mutual convenience. To such a contract, when invested with certain solemnities, the law has given the appellation of apprenticeship, attaching to the relation which is so contracted certain legal consequences; but because, in respect of the derivation of the term, it may be inferred that every contract of apprenticeship is a contract of service and instruction, it does not follow that every contract of service and instruction is an apprenticeship, so as to be void as a general contract at common law, unless invested with those special qualities which are attached by the law to the contract, technically denoted by that term; or that the incorrect insertion and admixture of such a term should vitiate the obligation that would otherwise have been effectually contracted between the parties. Nor can I conceive that if before the subject had received any prejudice from the decision upon cases of settlement, the question had arisen upon a case between the parties to the contract, the obligation which would otherwise have attached would by such an admixture have been defeated. In the law of real property, nothing Is more familiar than that an instrument which cannot operate in the precise manner which its form and expressions would import, shall operate in such other manner as will, consistently with the rules of law, effectuate the intention of the parties; as in the case of a feoffment without livery operating as a bargain and sale, or a covenant to stand seised.

In Salford v. Storeford, the first and leading case upon the subject under discussion, the instrument had all the requisites of a deed except a stamp; and without any particular reference to the settlement law, there is no dotibt that, as a general proposition, a deed which is defective for want of a stamp cannot be set up as an agreement. In the second case of Whitchurch r. Wotton Fitzpayne, B. . C. 540, it was agreed that the party should be an apprentice, and that indentures of apprenticeship should be executed, so that the parties never had it in contemplation that

5:

Ckss XXVIII.] Poor.

any relation should be contracted between them except that of a strict apprenticeship, which is very different from the cases where a complete and executed agreement was intended to be contracted, although expressed by an improper designation; but it is certain that the law has in subsequent cases, upon the mere supposed authority of these decisions, been carried, and is now established much further than the authority of the cases would necessarily require, or even fairly justify.]

There must be a service under the indenture for forty days, in the place where the settlement is claimed, and the settlement is where the party slept the last night, having been there forty days in the whole.

An apprentice leaving his master’s house to sleep at his mother’s, in a different parish, for the purpose of being cured of a disorder, continuing to be oqdoyed by his master, is settled in the parish where he sleeps; Stratford-pon-Avon, 11 E. 176.

But sleeping in a different parish where the apprentice is taken on account of illness, (doing no service for his master) is not a residence by which any settlement can be gained; Barmby in the Marsh, 7'E. 583; Scholefield, B.

. C. 511.

Where a master to whom an apprentice was assigned told the apprentice, a short time before the expiration of the term, that he must go and work elsewhere; and the apprentice slept a night in the parish where his first aster lived, bat did not see or apply to him, and had not any intention of doing so; it was held that that night could not be coupled with the former residence, so as to give a settlement; Smarsden, 13 E. 452.

If there be a service with a different person by assignment from the first aster, it is sufficient: so an assignment from a second to a third, Ac. c.

Assignment if in writing must be stamped as agreement; St. Paul's, Bedford, 6T.R. 452. Evidence of verbal agreement not admitted if there be an agreement reduced to writing, . C.

[There is no doubt of this point if it is all one transaction; but Q. if there is a complete verbal agreement, and a mere subsequent, written one.]

A paper purporting to be an original binding as an apprentice by the master to I. ., not good as an assignment or a consent to serve; Christo we, 11 E. 95.

So an assignment by or service with the widow of M. not having taken administration; East Bridgeford, B. . C. 133; or with the executor, Olier-tsn r. Stricland, Doug. 69.

A service with another person by the consent of the master, or the person ts whom the apprentice is assigned, is sufficient; but it must be actual and express consent to the particular service; mere knowledge of the particular service, or mere general consent to serve with any person, or the union of the two, is not sufficient. Upon this distinction there have been many cases.

I. What is a sufficient consent.

1. A hiring with another person as a servant upon the recommendation of the master; Fremington t>. Sherwell, B. . C. 416.

2. The master said to T. (the person to whom an apprentice, having

gamed leave to serve any other person, had hired himself; —“ I find you have an apprentice of mine.” T. “ I do not know that I have.'* M. u J. D. is my apprentice:you are welcome to keep him as long as you please; I shall flunk no more of him Brads tone, 2 Bott. 422.

3. The pauper agreed to give a guinea to be liberated, the master to give a suit of clothes when the guinea was paid; neither of which was done. B. refused to hire without M/s consent. P. applied to M. M. u You may go with all my heart: I think it will be a good thing.*' Shebbear, 1 East, 7S.

4. P. having agreed to giveM. two guineas for his time, and hired himself to .—M. said during service with ., “ You continue to work with : I think it a good place, and hope you will continue in it; '* Bradninch, Cald. 461.

5. P. turned away, (told she was no longer apprentice^ and that the indentures were destroyed:which was true as to one part) hired as a yearly servant, and told M., who said she was glad of it; St. Mary, Lambeth, 2 Bott. 419.

II. What not.

1. M. failing in business, told P. he might go where he pleased. P. afterwards told M. he was going to A.—M. u You may go then when you please; *9 Crediton, 1 E. 63.

2. M. consented that P. might do the best he could: P. was employed by J. ., who told M. that he had got P. at work; M. replied, “ I am glad of it; he was a bad lad, and 1 could make nothing of himSt. Helen, Stone-gate, 1 E.285.

Since Statute 32 Geo. III. c. 37, ante. Title Apprentices, No. 10, a settlement is not gained by a parish apprentice, who, by the consent of his mistress, during her life-time, lived with her son, and after her death with another person, by the son’s consent; Sheepshead, 15 E. 59.

[I should have very much doubted whether this Act could properly affect a question of settlement, as the obligation of master and apprentice, at common law, wholly ceased by the death of the master; and the regulations of the Act have no direct reference to the question of settlements, with regard to which this relation was in preceding cases held to continue.]

While the indenture continues in force, no settlement can be gained with a third person by hiring or service.

If the apprentice is bound by his father, the apprenticeship cannot, while he is an infant, be put an end to by agreement between the master and apprentice, without the assent of his lather, neither can a parish apprentice without the consent of the overseers; but an apprentice when of age, may, by agreement with the master, put an end to the apprenticeship without any consent.

If the master is dead, the apprentice is at liberty to hire himself without any consent from the master’s representatives.

The bankruptcy of the master does not determine the apprenticeship.

In what cases the apprenticeship is dissolved.

1. An exchange or delivering up of the indentures without cancellation.

2. A sum of money was paid by the father to the master, who gave a receipt for it, as from the apprentice for the remainder of his time, and offered to give up the indentures, which the father did not take, not thinking it material; Harberton, 1 T. R. 139.

In what not,

1. P. agreed verbally with M. to give him----for the remainder of his

time: it was agreed that M. should keep the indentures till the money was to be paid, which was to be from time to time, as P. could earn it; Slieh-beaxe, 1 E. 73.

[The decision in this case was, that a settlement was gained by apprenticeship; there being a consent to the service with C., with whom P. was hired.]

2. By the apprentice entering as a sailor in the navy; Hindringham, 6 T. R. 557.

[This case turned on the power of an apprentice to vacate the contract; as to which see Notes on Stat. 5 Eliz. ante. Title Apprenticeship, No. 1.]

3. Agreement that P. should work for his own benefit, paying M.---per week; Offerton v. Stockport, B. . C. 802.

[Settlement by apprenticeship under circumstances of consent.]

The proof of indentures of apprenticeship, in cases of settlement, depends upon the same rule as the proof of deeds and instruments in other cases.

If lost, and all reasonable inquiry is made for the indentures from the person in whose hands they ought to be, and where they were last proved to be, secondary evidence wiil be received.

An indenture produced by the adverse party, upon notice, does not prova itself, and must be regularly proved by subscribing witnesses; Gordon v, Secretan, 8 E. 548; over-niUng Middezoy, 2 T. R. 41.

An indendure upon which a premium was paid having been lost, and the pauper having been relieved by the parish for several years (residing there), the sessions presumed the duty to have been paid, although proved by th^ officer of stamps not to have been inrolled. Lord Ellen borough—“ The question before the sessions was, whether the presumption that all was rightly done, after the lapse of so many years, were sufficiently rebutted by the negative evidence of the officer:they thought not; and we cannot say

Class XXVIII.] Poor.

that they have done wrong, for the presumption of the law is to be favoured; and against the negative evidence they may have set the possibility of an irregularity in the return made to the officer Long Buckley, 7 E. 45.

[This can only shew, that if the sessions inferred the faot from the length of time, their inference could not be set aside as founded upon premises not adequate in point 6f law. It certainly did not prescribe any rule to sessions, that in similar cases they ought to make such presumption; and the true application of the rule, that omn>a presumuntur rite atse acla, would be rather in favour of the supposition, that if the duty had been paid the indenture would have been inrolted. To call the regular official document, in which, according to law and practice, the duty, if paid, would have been entered, negative evidence, seems to be rather a perversion of the term. Negative evidence is that which is consistent with the thing supposed to be negatived, having been done, but not observed or attended to:this is positive evidence of an existing state of things, contrary to that which would have existed if the requisites of the law hail been properly complied with.]

Section VI.—Of Settlement by taking a Tenement of 101.

A-YEAR.

I. What tenements have been held to give a settlement.

1. Coney Warren and Cottage; Kinver v. Stone, 2 Sir. 618.

2. A Rabbit Warren, without any other right in the soil than that of entering upon and killing rabbits there; Piddletrenthide, 3 T. R. 772.

3. A Fishery; Old Alresford v. Chilton Candover, 1 T. R. 358.

4. A Cattle gate: Whixley, 1 T. R. 137.

5. A right of common in gross; Dersingham, 7 T. R. 671.

6. The toll of a fair or market; Chipping Norton, 5 E. 239. But not upon a parol demise, being a mere licence; ruled ibid.

[But how could this be distinguished from the preceding case of the common, both being incorporeal hereditaments, which could not pass without deed ? The same observation will apply to the case of the rabbit warren, and all the subsequent cases respecting the pasture of cows, &c., these being mere incorporeal rights, passing not the soil itself, but merely an incidental right, lying only in grant, and in respect to which, if a title were to be set out in pleading, a mere parol contract would not be sufficient.]

7. Tolls of a bridge, though declared to be personal estate; Bub with, 1 M. and . 514.

8. A water-mill or wind-mill.

9. After-grass; Brampton, 4 T. R. 348.

10. The pasturage of a cow.

[In the first case upon this subject (Lockerley, B. . C. 315) it was held that a covenant to demise a house, with sixteen cows, and pasture on twenty-one acres, was not a tenement, but a mere personal contract; but in the cases of Piddletrenthide, 3 T. R. 772; Tolpuddlc, 4 T. R. 671, it was fully settled, that the letting of cows to be depastured in particular lands constituted a tenement in respect of the lands: and Lord Kenyon laid it down generally in the latter case, that any thing is a tenement which is profit oat of land:and these cases have been followed up by others, holding that the mere pasture of a cow, &c. in a ley with others, constitutes a tenement: but the value must be complete from the pasturage, without taking into account the use of the cow; Min worth, 2 E. 198.

In Didsbury, Nol. P. L. 25, Lawrence J. said, a contract to feed generally, under which they might be fed with green tares, would not be a tenement; which, to be sure, would seem almost as evident as that a contract tQ feed a man would not be a tenement.

But in Parley Abbey, 14 E. 280, where the agreement was for the milk of a cow for the season, and the person letting said at the time that A. B. would shew in what field the cow would first be milked, it was ruled by the sessions that a settlement was gained, which was confirmed in K. B. The chief point in discussion seems to have been, whether it was not properly inferred to have been the intention of the parties that the cow was to be fed on land and not on bay, &c. So far as the inference goes to establish a contract in respect of particular land, there is nothing to vary the case in principle from those that preceded it, and the justice of the particular inference is an enquiry confined to the particular case; out if if

is to be taken as the result of the case, that a contract to feed a cow on pasture generally, upon which it would be competent to provide any pasture within a reasonable distance, which the person so engaging might have, or even although he might at the time of the contract have no close at all, but must in order to execute hia contract acquire one at his peril, I apprehend that the case is completely anomalous, and that the idea of a tenement is Unsupported by any authority, more especially by any authority respecting the law of real estates. The true distinction would appear to be that of the modern civilians, between a jus in re and a jut dd rent, the former giving a right affecting the particular subject itself, and which might be asserted against all impugners; the latter a mere personal obligation against the individual for dot performing an engagement: and although in settlement ca*es the law as to what ia-necessary to constitute a jus in re may have been dispensed with bo far as relates to the legal formalities strictly requisite in matters of title, it would seem essential that there should at least be a completely specific thing in respect of which the right was acquired; and which right, if formally created by deed, would give a specific interest in the thing itself, and not that which would by the very terms of it be merely matter of personal obligation between the Individual upon an undefined subject. It is singular that one of the learned judges should fix upon this as the peculiar case for observing, that the magistrates ought not to send up cases, if they had no doubt upon their own minds.—* Here there could be no doubt that the contract was for the milking upon the farm, or at least within a reasonable distance *

To speak of doubting or not doubting, of clear cases or doubtful cases, may do very well in the abstract; but when the meaning of the expression is examined for the purpose of accurate reasoning, the solution will not be so very satisfactory. If it is a mere question of fact as to the doubts of an individual, it might apply to thej absence of doubt arising from want of knowledge, or of power to perceive the real difficulty, as well ms from the fulness of knowledge, which is adequate completely to resolve it; and the most ignorant byestander will in general have fewer doubts than the most enlightened judge. But if it is a question arising out of Ibe nature of the subject, surely there was no question which would more reasonably admit of the doubt, and possibly of the dissent, of those habitually and professionally conversant with the subject, than the very novel propositions involved in the opinion which has been last referred to.]

Of the value of 101. a-year.

The rent is only evidence of the value, and evidence may be received to shew that the real value is more or less, of which the sessions are the conclusive judges. But evidence of rent actually paid, without particular circumstances shewing a reason for its being more or less than the actual value, is’ generally, and very properly, regarded by the sessions as such evidence of value, as to counterbalance evidence of mere opinion to the contrary.

• Section VII.—Settlement by Estate.

e None of the statutes make any provision in favour of acquiring a settle-e ment by a person residing on his own estate, and the certificate Act expressly excludes the acquiring a settlement by persons under certificate, i otherwise than by holding a tenement of 10/. a-year, or by office; but in I consequence of the supposed intent of the law, that a person shall not be \ removed from his own estate of however small valne, this is an acknow-5 j ledged mode of acquiring a settlement, as well by persons having certifi- cates, as by others, however small the valne may be. But this mode of acquiring settlements is restrained by statute 9 G. c. 7, which provides that’no person shall acquire a settlement by any purchase of any estate or in• terest, whereof the consideration for such purchase doth not amount to 30/. for any further time than such person shall inhabit in such estate.

[The Court said, that the finding by the sessions that it was a public annual office precluded any further discussion; but when they described the particulars wherein the functions of the^office consisted, the finding was no more than was necessarily implied in the confirmation of the order.]

III. What not.

1. Stipendiary Cnrate; Wantage, 2 E. 65.

Section IX.—Settlement by Rates.

The statute 35th. Geo. III. c. 101., has put an end to this settlement as to all cases subsequent to its enactment, but the former law still subsists with jrespect to antecedent cases, and may be considered under three heads.

3. Highway rates.

II. The party must be rated

previous to payment; Edgbaston, 6 T. JR. 540.

The rate need not be by name;

The name of the tenement,

Of a former occupier,

A. B., or tenant —, is a sufficient rate on the tenant.

This is only a presumption, which may be repelled; as where

The tenement was rated by name; the landlord paid the rate; tenant allowed it; and the overseer knew nothing of the tenant; Llangamarch, 2 T. R. 628.

It seems now settled, that the question, whether landlord or tenant is rated, is a question of fact to be determined by the sessions: Folkestone, 3 T. R. 505.

If nothing appear to the contrary, the occupier should be presumed to be the person rated; St. Lawrence, Winchester, Cald. 370.

There being a column in the land tax assessment of landlords, and another of occupiers; the occupier paid the tax, and took a receipt for it, as assessed on the landlord. This rebutted the legal presumption that the tenant was rated; Sr. James, Bnry St. Edmunds’s Cald. 385.

The rate must be produced, or proper notice given to produce it; Cop-pull, 2 E. 25.

III. Payment.

There must be a payment as well as a rating; but a settlement is gained although the rate is allowed to the tenant by agreement with his landlord; Openshaw v. Gorton, B. . C. 522.

Or an officer of revenue be repaid, or allowed the amount by his superior; Okehampton v. Kenton, B. . C. 5; Axworth, 8 E. 383.

Secus where the rate was paid by the collector, and not deducted out of the officer’s salary; Weobley, 2 E. 60.

Section X.—Op Certificates.

See statutes 9 and 10 W. III. c. 11; 12 Ann, st. 1. c. 18. s. 2.; 3 Geo. II. c. 29. and notes.

Section XI.—Op Removals and Appeals.

I. An order of removal must be founded on a- complaint from the Churchwardens and overseers of the parish, or the overseers of the township, that the persons removed have come to inhabit in such parish or township, not having gained a settlement there, and that they are actually chargeable to such parish or township.

2. An adjudication of the truth of those facts.

3. An adjudication that they are settled in the place to which the removal is made.

A person meeting with an accident in a parish where he is casually at work, is not removable as having come to inhabit there; St. James’s, in Bury St. Edmund’s, 10 E. 25. But when a pauper residing in Kilburne, and relieved there, upon applying for relief Was desired to go to Fakenham, and being referred back from one to the other, was finally removed by Fakenham; the order was sustained, Lord Ellenborough saying that it was the case of a starving vagrant in whichever of the parishes she was, and she was liable to be removed from either; Birmingham, 14 E. 251.

Previous to the statute 35 Geo. III. c. 101. it was sufficient if the parties were likely to become chargeable; but in such case it was also necessary that the complaint and adjudication should state, that they had not brought a certificate acknowledging them to be settled elsewhere; it is not necessary



Class XXVIII.] Poor.

to alledge that the paupers are settled on a tenement of less than Id. a* year; Weston Rivers v. St. Peter's, 2 Salk* 493.

The justices making the order mnst appear to be justices for the county, or other district, within which the parish, See. from which the removal is made or situate. If the direction is at the beginning of the order, and two counties are there mentioned, justices for the said county is insufficient; Moor, Critchell, 2 £. 66. To prevent this mistake, it is eligible that the direction should be printed rather at the foot than at the head of the order. It is not necessary that they should be of the division; 2 Salk. 473. Justices for the borough, or town and parish, of Andover, is sufficiently certain; Caldec. 373.

The justices ought to be together at the time of the examination and order; but the objection that they were not so, can only be taken advantage of upon appeal, and does not render the order absolutely void; Stotfold, 4 T. R. 596.

There are several cases as to the necessity of setting forth the ages of children who are removed with their father to the place of his settlement; but it is now the constant course for the complaint and adjudication to refer as well to the children as the father.

A woman marrying a foreigner, or person whose settlement is not ascertained, retains her original settlement; hut cannot, if living with her husband in a different place, be removed to such settlement against his consent.

In tioylanaswain t>. Carleton, B. . C. 813, the wife and children were removed From the residence of the husband. In the statement of the case by the sessions, it was not expressly said that he did or did not consent, and the order was set aside; from which it seems to be a necessary consequence, that in such case an express consent must be proved.

An order to remove a married woman to the place of her settlement is good; Higher Walton, B. . C. 162. It is not necessary that the absence, or (come semble) the consent of the husband should appear on the face of the order; Ironactone. Painewick, B - . C. 153.

In Rex v. Hinxworth, Cald. 42, a removal of a wife and her children was held conclusive as to the settlement of the husband. Nothing appeared on the statement of facts, as reported, to shew whether the place to which the removal was made was the maiden settlement of the wife, or the supposed settlement of the husband. Lord Mansfield said, —“ The general rule of law is, that the settlement of the wife and children must depend upon that of the husband; ’tis true there are excepted cases, but unless such special circumstances are stated, we are bound to presume in favour of the general rule/’ In Rex c. Leigh, Dong. 45, the reversal of an order as to the wife was, upon the authority of the preceding case, held conclusive between the same parishes as to the husband; and a removal of a married woman, under the designation of widow, has also been held conclusive as to the settlement of her husband; Rudgeley, 8 T. R. 620.

[I have thought it eligible to bring these cases, respecting the settlements of married women, together; although some of them relate more particularly to a subsequent head. It is observable, that in none of the cases in which toe settlement of the husband has been deemed to be concluded by the removal of the wife, it has distinctly and specifically appeared, that the removal was to the maiden settlement of the wife, and that the husband had no settlement in England; but if there is no exception under such circumstances. it Follows that a parish may be burthened with the settlement of a husband, contrary to the truth of the fact, by an order, against which they could not by any possibility relieve themselves by appeal, as in the case of the husband being absent, or consenting to the removal.]

It certainly is not necessary that the order should be made on the examination of the persons removed, as the settlement may depend altogether upon other evidence. In Ware v. Starstead, Mount Filchet, 2 Salk. 488, Gould said, the practice was, to make the complaint to one justice, and he grants his warrant to bring the party before two justices.

In Rex e. Jackson, 1T. R. 653, the Court of B. R. refused to grant an information against justices, for committing a pauper who refused to answer a question respecting his settlement. Ana Ashurst and Duller expressed a strong opinion iu favour of the power of such commitment.

The removal must be to a parish or vill maintaining its own poor. A removal to the parish of Stepney, which was not appealed from, being, removed into the King's Bench, it was objected that the removal should have been to the township of Spittal Fields, ttit parish being divided into town.

ships maintaining their own poor; but the Court held that the objection ought to have been taken by appeal; Spittal Fields r. Bromley, 18 Vim. 468. A removal order to the parish of Kirkny Stephen delivered to the overseer of the’ township of Kirkby Stephen (being one of several townships within the parish), was held conclusive on the township; Kirkby Stephen c. Wharton, B. . C. 664. A removal to Ascott, being in fact a village within the parish of Whichford, not maintaining its own poor, is a mere nullity, though unappealed from; Swalcliffc, Cald. 248. A removal to the parish of Poole, or town and county of Poole, is good; the towu and county consisting of the aingle parish of St. James’s in Poole; Topsham, 7 E. 466.

In the case of Spittal Fields r. Bromley, above-mentioned, it was said that two townships within one parish are the same as two parishes; yet churchwardens are overseers of the poor of the whole parish (though so divided), and have a superintendency over the whole villages and townships. This seems very donbtful, especially since 17 George II. c. 38, post.; which enacts, that in such townships the overseers alone may act in all respects as churchwardens and overseers may do in other places: and I conceive that the churchwardens of a parish divided into townships, or the overseers of a township having the same name with the parish of which it constitutes a part, arc not bound to receive an order upon the parish.

The appeal may be either by the place to which the removal is made, or by the person removed.

The appeal must be to the sessions of the county, division, or riding, where the place from which the removal is made is situate, and not elsewhere; 8 and 9 W. c. 30. s. 6.

An appeal to the sessions of a borough (by the justices of which the order is made), although acquiesced in by entering on the merits, is wholly nugatory; East Donyluud r. St. Giles’s, Chichester, B. . C. 592.

The term division seems applicable only to the county of Lincoln, which is divided into three several parts, having separate commissions of the peace like the ridings of Yorkshire.

The appeal must be to the next sessions after the removal.

Except where there is not sufficient time for the purpose.

As where the removal was on the 5th of October, and the sessions held at 60 miles’ distance on the 6th (the subsequent sessions being considered in such case the next possible sessions); East Riding of Yorkshire, Doug. 183.

Where there were two intervening days, and the distance was twenty miles; ruled that the appeal ought to have been to the first sessions.

When the sessions were the day after the removal, and continued fourteen days, an appeal at the following sessions was held sufficient; and per Curiam —“ The appellant parish ought to have a reasonable time for considering, whether they will appeal or not; ” Surrey, 1 M. and . 479.

When the sessions of a county arc adjourned from place to place, and the removal is after the commencement of the original sessions, an appeal to the adjourned sessions of the following quarter is in time; Justices of Sussex, 7 T. R. 107.

In London and Middlesex an appeal to the next general quarter sessions is sufficient, notwithstanding there being an intermediate general sessions; Justices of London, 15 E. 632.

By 9 Geo. c. 7. s. 8. no appeal can be proceeded upon unless reasonable notice has been given; and if reasonable time of notice has not been given, the justices are to adjourn the appeal to the next sessions.

It is imperative on the sessions to receive the appeal, although notice may not have been given, and although there may have been sufficient time for the purpose; Justices of Huntingdonshire, Cald. 233; Gloucestershire, Doug. 182; Shropshire (printed by mistake in the report Staffordshire), 7 E. 549; the case of the North Riding of Yorkshire, 3 T. R. 150. Coutril, is overruled by the subsequent case of Shropshire.

Where the appeal was properly entered, but notice was not given of it before the following sessions, according to a new rule made by the sessions, and not known to the appellant’s attorney, the sessions refused to hear the appeal, or to adjourn it further, thinking they had no power to do so. The Court of K. B. held that they ought to have adjourned it, and granted a mandamus: Lord Ellenborough said, the magistrates certainly had a discretion with respect to what was reasonable time for giving notice of appeal, but that Court had also visitatorial power over them, in the exercise of such a discretionary power; Wiltshire, 10 E. 404.

[As every sessions have their particular rules with respect to the time of notice, which is frequently unknown to parishes at a distance,

I think it would be desirable to regulate the subject by a general legislative provision.

The following would, perhaps, be as eligible a plan as any other:

That the appeal might, in all cases, be to the next sessions or next bnt one after the removal.

That notice should be given two weeks exclusive before the week in which the sessions are held; or in other words, that there should be one full week exclusive of the week in which the respective days fall from which the sessions are computed.]

With respect to hearing the appeal, it is now settled as a general rule of 5. Of hearing law, that the respondents must begin and prove their case. The practice the appeal, upon this subject was formerly regulated by the accidental usage of each particular sessions.

I apprehend that it is clearly competent for the appellant to require proof, not only of the settlement, but of the party being chargeable.

It does not seem to be material to advert to general rules of evidence which apply to cases of settlement, as there is not any difference in the application of those rales when arising in such cases, from that which prevails upon other

his seems to be the proper place to notice the evidence of relief as 6. Evidence o prirna facie proof of settlement; with respect to which it is established, that relief, evidence of relief to a person, being within the parish, and however often such relief may have been given, is not admissible; Chadderton, 2 E. 27;

Chatham, 8 E. 498, for persons requiring relief are to be relieved in the parish where the^ are, until some other place of settlement can be found; but, evidence or relief given to a person residing in another parish or township is admissible; R. r. Wakefield, 5 E. 333; and such evidence is treated, in the late editions of Burn, as forming a distinct kind of settlement; and though only prima facie evidence of settlement, it was held in Rex v. Stanley cum Wrintliorpe, 13 E. 359, that where repeated instances of such relief had been ' given to the pauper and his family, the sessions had drawn the right concliv sion in holding it not rebutted by a certificate given to the grandfather of the pauper many years before by a different parish.

And see Rex v. Barnsley, 1 M. and . 377, in which the Court held, that relief for seven years was evidence of such preponderating weight, that the sessions ought to have drawn the conclusion that the pauper was, by some means or other, a settled inhabitant:—See Observations on this Case infra.

It is evident, however, that such evidence should be received with very considerable caution, when the real facts of the case are capable of being shewn; the relief being only evidence of acknowledgement of settlement by the overseers, whose mistakes of either fact or law are not to bind the parish to which they belong: and I should be very unwilling to lay any stress upon this acknowledgment, if it appeared to have been occasioned by tacts which are within the reach of inquiry; as in any case it is incorrect to be satisfied with the presumption of a fact which is capable of proof, being in principle at least an infringement of the rule (much more known in its expression than in its just and proper application), that the best evidence should be required which the nature of the case will admit.

The Annual Mutiny Act contains a provision, that if any non-commissioned 7. Exam inn-officer or soldier shall have a wife or children, two justices may summon him tions under tfi where he is quartered, to make oath of the place of ids settlement, and he Mutiny Act. shall obey such summons and make oath accordingly; and the justices shall give an attested copy of such affidavit to be delivered to the commanding officer, to be produced when required; which attested copy shall be at any time admitted in evidence as to such settlement, before any justices, or at any sessions; and if he be summoned again to make such oath as aforesaid, then, on such attested copy of the oath by him previously made being produced, he shall not be obliged to take any other or further oath with regard to his settlement, but shall leave a copy of such attested examination if required.

In Rex v. Clayton le Moors, 5 T. R. -704, an attested copy of an examination, but which had not been delivered to the commanding officer, was held DM admissible in evidence, not being such copy as the Act requires. Lord Kenyon observed—“ Whether it was or was not wise to introduce such a clause in the Mutiny Acts, which was not formerly contained in those^ statutes, it is unnecessary to inquire; but the question here is, whether this act of Parliament, which makes an innovation on the law of evidence, should be

c

8. Evidence of parishioners.

.Declarations of parishioners.

Poor: [Part

carried beyond the express words of it ? In my opinion it ought to ix? construed strictly; for the examination which is to be made evidence is ex parte examination, and which the party has no opportunity of knowing at the time it is taken, and of coarse they are deprived of all opportunity of cross-examining the party who makes it.”—Some doabt was expressed in that case, whether the original examination was evidence; but in Rex: w. Warley, 6 T. R. 534, it was ruled to be so. The paper does not prove itself", and must be authenticated before it can be received in evidence; Belton vritlx Harrowgate, 1 E. 13.

The observations of Lord Kenyon as to the propriety of the Act being construed strictly, are founded upon very important reasons; and it may be material to observe, that unless the soldier is summoned by two justices where he is quartered, the provision does not apply. Such examinations are usually procured on behalf of" a parish interested, and are often conceived in very vague and general terms, perfectly inadequate to give a proper view of the real facts of the case; and as they are in general calculated to produce st conclusion upon the fact without any satisfactory investigation of" the truth, it may not be unimportant for those who are engaged in preparing the Mutiny Acts to consider, whether the inconvenience which is intended to be remedied by the introduction of the clause in question, would so materially affect the public service as to induce them to continue it.

A great many questions have formerly occurred respect the competence or incompetence of parishioners in questions of settlement affecting the parish in which they inhabited or possessed rateable property. But the objection to which these questions relate is removed by stat. 54 Geo. III. c. 170, (post.) sec. 9, by which it is provided, that no inhabitant or person rated or liable to be rated in any parish, See. should, by reason thereof, be taken to be an incompetent witness for or against such parish, &c. in any matter relating to any order of removal to or from such parish, &c. or in the several other subjects particularly mentioned in the Act.

There are opposite opinions amongst persons conversant with the subject, respecting the wisdom and policy or this enactment; but so far as my own observation goes, I conceive its tendency on the whole to be much more beneficial than otherwise, and that the rejection of the testimony of the parties in question had more frequently operated in the exclusion of truth, than in the prevention of falsehood; more particularly when the persons who are in general under the greatest, real influence upon the subject, the paupers themselves, were legally competent, and had an opportunity or giving, without contradiction, the narrative most congenial with their own wishes. But it is certain that the alteration in the law, however much it may be intitled to approbation as to its general effects, renders it proper to apply a great degree of caution in weighing the credit of witnesses, whose competence can no longer be objected to, and in watching with jealousy and suspicion that spirit of parochial feeling, which, in many cases, is extremely prevalent, and perhaps not difficult, with a moderate share of observation, to detect. It is obvious that, catteru paribus, this spirit will naturally prevail in a greater degree amongst the inhabitants of a small country hamlet, where the trial of a settlement case is a matter of general interest and attraction, than among the inhabitants of an extended district, to whom the existence of such case would be probably unknown, if their own immediate testimony had not been connected with it.

In Rex*. Woburn, 10East, 395, it was ruled, that a rated inhabitant of one of the parishes concerned in an appeal was not compellable to give evidence against such parish, although certainly he could not have been objected against when called upon by the opposite parish; and the cause was ruled not to be affected by the statute 46 Geo. III. c. 37, declaring that parties cannot refuse to give evidence on the ground that it may affect their interest. Le Blanc J. observed, that u if the sessions had been aware at the time of the extent of the question, there would have been no difficulty; for if the witness were rejected on the ground of his being a party to the suit, his declaration of any tacts touching the matter in issue would necessarily have been evidence against himself.”—The correctness of this incidental opinion was very soon established in Rex r. Hardwicke, li East, 578, and was regarded as a corollary from the preceding decision; a point upon which I have always entertained considerable doubt, and the Court appeared to be fully aware of the important consequences which might result from it. Mr. Justice Bailey observed, that unless the opposite party first offered to

65

Class XXVIII.] Poor.

call such inhabitant as a witness, which was objected to, did not think that in ordinary cases the magistrates should give any weight to mere declarations of that kind; though there may be occasions when the declaration of inch a party would have great weight.—I do not think that^he observation last adverted to would very materially remove the inconvenience that would probably result from the decision; for a witness might have many reasons to refuse being examined, with which the parish of which he was an inhabitant would not have any concern, and none more powerful than his having made assertions which he knew were contrary to the truth.

I have known it decided at the sessions, that the late Act 54 Geo. III. e. 170, above alluded to, had the effect of compelling parishioners to give evidence, and consequently of preventing their declarations being received.

It (fid not appear to me that it would admit of so large a construction; and I conceive that it would be very desirable that a legislative provision should he expressly made for effecting those objects.

If the magistrates in sessions are equally divided in opinion, the decision of 10. Justices the appeal should be adjourned to the following sessions; but when the clerk equally di-oftbe peace made an entry by mistake, that there was a majority for quash- vided. ing the order (the fact being, that one of the justices who had made the order, having voted for confirming it, which made a majority of one, withdrew such I vote upon being apprized of the fact, whereby the numbers were reduced to an equality), it was held that no mandamns would lie to enter continuances, upon affidavit of the facts, although it would have been competent to the court of quarter sessions to reform the error during the continuance of its sitting;

Justices of Leicestershire, 1 M. and . 449.

One of the most important considerations for the decision of courts of n. Of stating

quarter session, in cases upon the poor laws, is the propriety of granting a case,

or withholding a case for the purpose of bringing the rectitude of their decisions in review before the Court of King’s Bench. Some very great judges have strongly expressed their opinion in favour of the facility of granting such cases. Lord Hard wieke said—“ To be sure it is a thing very . much to be censored and discommended, when an inferior jurisdiction endea-: fours to preclude the parties from an opportunity of applying to a superior

Oulton v. Wells, B. . C. 64. In another case he said—* If the justices

will not state the facts specially (though requested so to do) when the matter is doubtful, this is very blameable conduct in them, and it is to be wished that it might be avoided.—Lord Mansfield, at nisi prius, always shewed a great readiness in granting cases, by which the parties, might have an opportunity of a more deliberate discussion of any legal question, taking proper precaution to prevent that facility being made a subject of abuse. In modern cases it has been very often recommended to justices in sessions not to reserve cases when they had not themselves a serious doubt. In a former I part of this note I have adverted to the weight which ought to be given to the absence of doubt as a reason for withholding the opportunity of further dis-i cession.

I Nothing could be more fallacious than any general theory as to the ade- quacy or inadequacy of courts of quarter session, to form a correct opinion lpon disputed questions of law. Such courts are sometimes composed of persons of long professional experience: they may be composed of gentlemen, who, without having been professionally connected with the study of the law, may have devoted to this particular branch of it a very considerable attention, accompanied by a very accurate judgment; bat it is also manifest, that they are not (infrequently composed of persons who have not, by any means, devoted that attention to the subject which is requisite, to enable them to pronounce, upon the sudden impression of the moment, an adequate judgment on any question, forming part of a system so extremely complicated and artificial as the law of settlements; but are obliged to eoilect the law upon the subject, from the statement which is made of the law during the trial of the particular cases. From the experience of a long attendance upon courts of quarter sessions, in two large and populous counties, I have received the impression, that in general (although, certainly, not without exception) the greatest readiness to submit a case to further revision is shewn by those who have the most extensive and familiar knowledge of the general law of the subject; and that the greatest tenacity has been maintained in support of opinions, pronounced in opposition to first principles, under the influence of counsel who had the talent^ when the case would not admit of strength of argument, to supply the want of it by confidence of manner.

It should always be recollected, that after the case is reserved, the losing

parties have strong motives to pause before they avail themselves of the opportunity of bringing it into further discussion; that if they fail they have all the costs to pay, and are^not entitled to recover any if they succeed; and consequently, that they will not, if acting under proper ad vice, be induced to expose themselves to such a hazard, unless there is either a very great interest in the question, or a strong probability of success. During the time that it has been customary to recommend the refusal of reserving cases (which I thinlc may be dated from the appointment of Lord Kenyou as chief justice), I have observed, that notwithstanding such recommendations, the number of eases in which the orders of sessions were reversed bear a very large proportion to those in which they were confirmed; and to bring the subject to a, test, I have compared their relative numbers, in the supplement lately published to Bott’s Poor Laws, embracing ten volumes of reports, and containing 111 cases, in 49 of which the orders of sessions were reversed, and in 46 confirmed (the remaining 16 cases arising upon applications for mandamus, and other proceedings foreign to the present question). Of the cases confirmed, the decision in some merely proceeded on the gronnd that the decision of the sessions on either side onght not to be disturbed; so that they would equally have been confirmed if they tiad been the other way; and consequently, in a considerable majority of the cases, where a judgment was actually pronounced on the merits of the case, it was against the propriety of the former decision; and which, I apprehend, is to be in a great measure accounted for, by the caution which is naturally entertained as to incurring the hazard above alluded to, without a just and reasonable prospect of success; and from these considerations it seems reasonably to follow, that although a case ought not to be granted as a matter of course, and merely because it is asked for, the error of too easily acceding t<r such an application is in its nature much less prejudicial to the real justice of the case, than the error of refusing it, without a full and well-grounded confidence in the rectitude of the opinion which is entertained.

When a case is agreed to be granted, a system of jockeyship and mantra-vring often takes place with regard to the manner of stating it; there is often an attempt to introdnee some incidental finding, which may be eanglit hold of as a legal point, and elnde a decision upon the real question which has been previously contested, particularly by the finding of something as a matter of fact, with regard to what has been agitated merely as a question of law. Two instances of this kind, which many years ago occurred to myself in practice, will sufficiently illustrate this observation:A person had been hired for a year, at weekly wages, as a servant, without any exception as to hoars of work or of Sundays. From his having the common remissions from labour, the sessions were persuaded to find, “ that it was the intention of both parties at the time of the contract, that there should be some time during which the master should not have a controul over the servant.’* In another case upon that point of contract of service and instruction, which is the -foundation of the case of Little Bolton, and others that had followed it, the word Apprentice never having been mentioned; but the counsel having prevailed upon a witness to say Yes, in answer to the question—“ Did not you intendyonr son to go as an apprentice?* afterwards prevailed upon the court to find, that the parties intended a contract of apprenticeship.—Of coarse it was not deemed eligible, in either case, to trouble the Court of King's Beucb upon the questions intended to be reserved. In all these cases the most judicious course which the sessions can adopt appears to be, to confine the case to a statement of the facts which actnally occurred.

Upon some subjects where the contrariety of decisions has involved the law in an inextricable labyrinth, it has been recommended to the sessions in fnture to decide the case one way or the other as a matter of fact (as in the much litigated question of dispensation or dissolution of service) which certainly, so far as it goes, is a commodious way of cutting the knot, which it is difficult to untie. But although this may prevent the discussion of cases in the King’s Bench, it will have the effect of very much multiplying them at the sessions, as the parties may be reasonably advised that it comes merely to a question of casting lots; whereas if the Court of King’s Bench, in such cases, would disencumber the subject from the mass of contradictory decisions, by laving down a broad, general principle, according to the true construction of the law, a rule would be given to which the advice of counsel could be properly applied, and a great expense of litigation upon the mere chance of the tables would be prevented. The late cases upon the particular subject which have been alluded to, afford an instance of the expediency of this course of proceeding; and the short question, whether a servant was or was not to be

Class XXVIII.; ] Poor.

under the (oatrMl of the matter, cu s easily he considered in a question of settlement, as in a case where such controul was in fact attempted to be exercised.

There are few questions which are not essentially questions either of fact er law, or which can with propriety be treated indifferently as the one or the other:and although such questions may be intimately blended and connected, they are almost always, with due care, capable of separation, and are distinguishable in cases on the poor law, with reference to the respective provinces of the quarter sessions and the Court of King's Bench, as in ordinary civil cases, with reference to the province of a court and a jury, wherein the withdrawing from a jury the decision of a.question of fact, or the submits ting to them a question of law, would, if properly introduced on the record, he equally a matter of error.

It may not be irrelevant (o remark, that when a special case is stated for the purpose of raising a certain point, incidental and collateral circumstances, upon which no dispate appears to have arisen, may be considered as sufficiently established, although not particularly noticed. Thus hi the.case of Aire and Calder Navigation, 2 T. R. 660, upon the validity of a poor rate, it was objected that it did not appear that it had been published in the church; upon which Buller J. observed, that if the objection were to hold, it would destroy every case of the sort that came before the court; but the distinction between orders and special verdicts had been long established; in the latter, the whole case must appear upon record; but the very reverse is the rule which obtains in the case of orders of justices, for the court will intend every thing to be right, which does not appear to be otherwise; and they will not entertain a doubt upon any subject, upon which the justices did not.

Hint the decision of pure questions of fact is exclusively the province of the sessions, is a proposition which is generally acknowledged as a first principle of settlement law; but in some recent cases, the Court of King's Bench have reversed the judgment of the sessions upon such questions. For instance, in Rex v. Barnsley, 1 M. and 8. 877, supra (7.) the sessions having drawn a conclusion which appeared to the court to be wrong, Lord Ellenborough said—“ The only doubt is, whether, where the sessions have drawn a conclusion palpably erroneous, we should send the case down again, or, in ease of the parties, draw the irresistible conclusion ourselves. The relief given is evidence of such preponderating weight, that I should think any jadge would direct a jury to find upon such evidence (supposing the question legally to come before them) that G. was by some means or other a settled inhabitant of the parish:" and the order was reversed. That the Court of King’s Bench took the proper view of the facts of the case may be fairly conceded; but it is in strong and favourable cases, and where expense will be saved to the parties, that a deviation is almost always made, in the first instance, from the regular course and system of the law; and such deviation is afterwards gradually followed up to an extent, which, if it could have been foreseen, would have evinced the propriety of adhering to the regular order tad system of the law. It was an observation of Lord Mansfield, that favourable eases make bad precedents. Admitting that under the circumstances a judge would have given a strong direction to the jury, and that a court, in case of their finding an opposite verdict, would have thought it a proper erne for granting a new trial, no case has vet occurred in which the courts have substituted themselves in the place of the jury, and have entered a ver-dkt in opposition to that which was actually given.

The positive directions given in some cases to juries, respecting the pre-wnption which they are required to draw upon matters of fact, has introduced one of the greatest and most inconvenient anomalies in the law with respect to the effect of length of time upon incorporeal rights, and created an heterogeneous system, in which the verdict is dictated to the jury as upon a natter of law, and the judgment of the court cannot be made the subject of revision, because, in point of form, the decision is a finding of the iury upon the fact; a system which gradually emanated from some loose and incidental opinions at Nisi Prius. In every decision of a superior court, it is of sonnet importance to regard the effects and consequences of the precedent which may be established, that nothing can be more justly deprecated than a departure from established principles, in order to accomplish an object-of accidental and immediate convenience in a particular case.

With reference to the immediate subject it may be further observed, tha£? where the case states mere evidence respecting that which is truly and properly a question of fact, H seems to be the proper, as it certainly waslongthe established practice of the Court of King's Bench, to decline giving any

«* Poor. EPartVl. IH

judgment upon the weight and effect of inch evidence, however strong and ns satisfactory it may be, as being a subject not properly within their cognizance, m\ in the same manner as in the well-known case of a special verdict in trover wi they would not give any judgment upon a mere finding of a demand and re- tin fusal, which is only evidence of a conversion, and not a conversion itself: a an distinction which is very far from being merely verbal, and is a complete iUua lustration of the very important distinction, which canpot be too much insist- at, ed upon between law and fact. f M

Before dismissing this subject it may be proper to observe, that when the case is reserved by the session *, not upon the fact of the settlement itself, but in respect of the admission or rejection of evidence, and it is held that xm the decision upon that point is erroneous, the proper course is not to reverse isw the order, but to remand the case to the sessions, to be there decided, unless*; a it appear that the case was founded solely upon inadmissible evidence; ia $tn which case, as the exclusion of the evidence would have left no ground for the order that has been occasioned by it, the decision of the inadmissibility «:vi of fiie evidence should induce the reversal of the order. This distinction may *, be illustrated by referring to the case of admitting one of several witnesses e, * to the same fact, who was incompetent and which is only a ground for re- man ding a case, and admitting the parol evidence of rates, without a'proper* notice to produce them; which being the only evidence of the fact of ratin?, i)Q| the decision that the evidence was improperly received involves the dccisico, qjg that the order founded upon it should be reversed.

It is settled as a general rule, that an order of removal, confirmed or nn-appealed from, is conclusive of the settlement against all the world. Ac-71, cording to the expression of Lord EUenborough, in Rex v. Corshani, 11 East, 388.—“ It is in effect a statutable certificate, that the pauper was settled^I at the place to which he is removed: the statute gives him a settlement; ]^ there, and the fact stated by the sessions ef a prior settlement elsewhere immaterial/ '

Perhaps it might be convenient, if a course were adopted by which a pa- riih, in which a person might happen to be as casual poor without any prc-; a tence of settlement there, conld procure the question to be agitated between^ the two parishes, in one of which the real settlement confessedly is, and net be subjected to the inconvenience and expense of agitating a question, ia; :j which, eventually, it has not any interest/ But I am aware that the details , | of such a measure would require very minute and attentive consideration.

An order of removal, whether executed or not, may, before the sessions to which the appeal is to be made, be abandoned*by the mutual consent ofK the parish obtaining it, and the parish upon which it is made; Llanrhyeld ‘v. Denbigh, B. . C. 658; Diddles bury, 12 East, 359. In the latter case the order was annulled by the consent of the justices making it, but that does not appear to have formed an ingredient in the decision, and did not occur in the former.

The removal of two persons, as husband and wife, is evidence as to the:marriage between them, both with respect to themselves and after-born cbil- ' dren. It was also held, in Rex v. St. Mary Lambeth, 6 T. R. 615, that the *. removal of a woman, as the wife of A. B., was conclusive evidence of the le- *. gality of the marriage, as to children previously born, and not included in the order, the court holding it to be conclusive not only on the persons removed, bat also on all derivative settlements from them. This decision seems rather questionable in principle; for being a matter of estoppel contrary to the truth of the case, the judgment would seem only to conclude the immediate subject matter of it; viz. the existence of the relation of husband and wife at the ' time of the order, and not the legitimacy of children born at an antecedent period. See cases in the preceding part of this section, as to the effect of a removal of the wife, or person reputed as such, without the husband.

In Rex «. Chilverscotton, 8 T. R. 178, an order nnappealed from was heldconclusive, although void upon the face of it, it not appearing that the justices who made it were of the county from which it was made.

It is also agreed that an order quashed upon the merits is conclusive, so as to prevent a second removal from the same parish bat thgt an order quashed for want of form, or other matter collateral to the settlement, as the not being chargeable, is not so. In Osguthorpe v. Deseworth, 2 Str. 1127, being the removal of a certificated person, it appeared that the first order was before be was chargeable, and the second alter; and the coort held, that the first order having been premature, the consequence was only that the party must be suffered to remain till he did become chargeable, and not to make a premature removal final for ever.

Glass XXVIII.] Pear.

Since the statute 35 Geo. HI. parties are often tamed round for not being able to prove that the pauper was chargeable.

Whenever an order is set aside upon a special ground not affecting the settlement, it is very desirable that a special entry should be made of the reason, so as not to shut out the justice of the case, or to leave it open to subsequent alteration, as to the ground and reason of the decision. I have not infrequently, however, known an application for the purpose refused, although 1 think that, in point of professional fairness, it ought not to be even resisted.

It is established, that an order reversed is not material as affecting a removal from third parishes.

In Honiton o. South Beverton, Comb. 401, it was laid down, that after the reversal of an order, two justices of the county to which the removal was nadc might remove the pauper back to the removing township, for it was but an execution of the order of sessions; which could not otherwise be done, because It was out of the jurisdiction of the court of sessions. In the subsequent case of Rex e. Milverton, f Bott. 7If, the sessions having reversed the order, and directed the party to be sent back, it was held that they had •aiy power to affirm or quash, and not to make a new order; and the latter part of the order was quashed. I apprehend that the case in Comberbach baa not been acted upon, 'and is not law; and that the want of jurisdiction is the sessions would apply, a fortion, to the acts of justices out of ses-’lions.

That all such persons who think themselves aggrieved with any such judgement of the said two justices may appeal to the next general qoarter sessions of the peace to be held for the county, riding, city, town-corporate, or liberty, from which the said person was so removed.

XL And whereas many inconveniences do daily arise in cities* townscorporate, and parishes, where the inhabitants are very numerous, byrea- son of the unlimited power of the churchwardens and overseers of the ' poor, who do frequently upon frivolous pretences (but chiefly for their

own private ends) give relief to what persons and number they think fit,

and such persons being entered into the collection bill, do become after

that a great charge to the parish, notwithstanding the occasion or pretence of their receiving collection oftentimes ceases, by which means the rates

for the poor are daily increased, contrary to the true intent of a statute

made in the forty-third year of the reign of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth,

intituled. An Act for the Relief of the Poor; * For remedying of which, and preventing the like abuses for the fututre. Be it further enacted, that from and after the first day of March, there shall be provided and kept in every pariah (at the charge of the same parish) a book or books, wherein the names of all such persons who do or may receive collection shall be registered, with the day and year when they were first admitted to have react and the occasion which brought them under that necessity: And that yearly in JEaster week (or as often as it shall be thought convenient) the parishioners of every parish shall meet in their vestry or other usual place of meeting in the same parish, before whom the said book shall be produced, and all persons receiving collection to be called over, and the reasons of their taking relief examined, and a new list made and entred, of such persons as they shall think fit and allow to receive collection, and that no other person be allowed to have or receive collection at the charge of the said parish, but by authority under the hand of one justice of peace residing within such parish, or (if none be there dwelling) in the parts near or next adjoining, or by order of the justices in their respective quarter sessions, except in cases of pestilential diseases, plague, or small-pox, for and in respect of such families only as are or shall be therewith infected.

XII. And whereas many churchwardens and overseers of the poor, and

other persons intrusted to receive collections for the poor, and other

publics monies relating to the churches and parishes whereunto they do (belong, do often mispend the said monies, and take the same to their own use, to the great prejudice of such parishes, and the poor, and other inhabitants thereof; and because that many times the judges, when actions are brought against such churchwarden^and overseer, to recover the mo- uies so mispent, taken, or misapplied by the persons aforesaid, refuse to

admit the parishioners to be witnesses in such cases, who are the only persons that can make proof thereof; Wherefore, to prevent all such evil and deceitful practices of churchwardens and overseers, and other persons, Be it enacted and declared, that in all actions to be brought in their Majesties Courts of Record at Westminster, or at the assizes, for the recovery of any sum or sums of money so mispent or taken by churchwardens or overseers of the poor, the evidence of the parishioners, or any of them, other than of such as receive alms or any pension or gift out of such collections or publick monies of such parish or parishes respectively, whereof the defendant or defendants is or are inhabitant or inhabitants, shall be taken and admitted in all such cases in the courts aforesaid; any custom, rule, order, or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.

some Defects in the Laws for the Relief of the Poor of this Kingdom.

FORASMUCH as many poor persons chargeable to the parish, township or place, where they live, merely for want of work, would in

any other place where sufficient employment is to be had, maintain

themselves and families, without being burthensome to any parish, township or place, but not being able to give such security as will or may be

expected and required upon their coming to settle themselves in any

should be kept, wherein the names of all persons who did or might receive collections should be registered, with the time when they were

first admitted to such relief ana the occasion which brought them under

that necessity; and that no such person should be allowed to have or receive collection at the charge of the parish, but by authority or under the

hand of one justice of the peace residing in such parish, or if none there dwelling, in the parts near or next adjoining, or by order of the justices

at their quarter-sessions, except in case of pestilential diseases, plague or

small-pox: And whereas, under colour of the proviso in the said Act,

many persons have applied to some justices of peace, without the knowledge of any officers or the parish, and thereby upon untrue suggestions,

and sometimes upon false or frivolous pretences, have obtained relief,

which hath greatly contributed to the increase of the parish ratesFor remedy whereof, Be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the twenty-fifth day of March which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twenty-three, no justice of peace shall order relief to any poor person dwelling in any parish, until oath be made before such justice of some matter which he shall judge to be a reasonable cause or ground for having such relief, and that the same person had by himself, herself, or some other, applied for relief to the parishioners of the parish, at some vestry or other public meeting of the said parishioners, or to two of the overseers of the poor of such parish, and Was by them refused to be relieved, and until such justice hath sumjnoned two or the overseen of the poor to shew cause why such re *

(f) It was held that overseers were justified in refusing obedience to an order for payment of a weekly sum to a woman for the maintenance of her$elf and her bastard children:they offering to take them into the workhouse; Carlisle, cited Rex v. Haigh, 3

T. R. 637. In the case of North Shields, Doug. 316. Cald. 68, Willes and Bailer J. expressed an opinion in favour of an order for payment of a weekly sum to a married woman for the support of her children by her husband; Ashurst contra; hot the case was determined on another ground. In Rex «. Haigh, 3 T. R. 637, it was held that overseers were indictable for disobedience of an order for a weekly payment to a woman for the maintenance of her bastard child; the mother refusing to go into the workhouse. Lord Kenyon said it would be contrary to the spirit and words of the Act of ParliaVol. VIII. G

ment, if, when all the children of a family except one were capable of supporting themselves, and that one were unable to maintain itself, and were under the necessity of receiving relief, the whole family was to be sent to the workhouse. It is however manifest, that in whatever form the order may be made, the relief is, in these cases, given substantially to the head of the family; but the case of bastards may be very distinguishable from that of legitimate children.-—As to relief out of workhouses, see post. 36 Geo.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the twenty-fifth day of March, which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twenty-three, ho person*or persons shall be deemed, adjudged or taken, to acquire or gain any settlement in any parish or place, for or by virtue of any purchase of any estate or interest in such parish or place, whereof the consideration for such purchase doth not amount to the sum of thirty pounds, bona fide paid, for any longer or further time than such person or persons shall inhabit in such estate, and shall then be liable to be removed to such parish or place where such person or persons were last legally settled, before the said purchase and inhabitancy therein.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That no person or persons whatsoever, who from and after the twenty-fifth day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twenty-three, shall be taxed, rated or assessed to the scavenger or repairs of the highway, and shall duly pay the same, shall be deemed or taken to have any legal settlement in any city, parish, town or hamlet, for or by reason of his, her, or their paying to such scavenger’s rate or repairs of the highway as aforesaid; any law to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

VII. And whereas there was a clause in the statute made in the eighth f and ninth years of his late Majesty King William the Third, intituled, An Act for the supplying some Defects in the Law for the Relief of the Poor of 1 this Kingdom, * whereby it was enacted. That after the first day of May

whence such person should be removed, doth lie, and not elsewhere, except the liberty of St. Albans Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful for the justices of the peace within the liberty of the borough of Saint Peter, and Hundred of Nassaborough, in the county of Northampton, to hear and determine all appeals to them made, against any order made for removal of any poor person in their quarter-sessions, as they might have done before the making of the said last mentioned Act; any thing therein *or in this present Act contained to the contrary thereof in anywise notwithstanding.

VIII. And whereas several disputes and controversies have arisen and

been concerning the time of notice to be given of appeals from orders of removals of poor persons; * To prevent the same, as much as may be for the future, Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twenty-fifth day of March, one thousand seven hundred and twenty-three, no appeal or appeals from any order or orders of removal of any poor person or persons whatsoever, from any parish or place to another, shall be proceeded upon in any court or quarter-sessions, unless reasonable notice be given by the churchwardens or overseers of the poor of such parish or place, who shall make such appeal, unto the churchwardens or overseers of the poor of such parish or place from which such poor person or persons shall be removed; the reasonableness of which notice shall be determined by the justices of the peace at the quarter-sessions, to which the appeal is made; and if it shall appear to them that reasonable time of notice was not given, then they shall adjourn (4) the said appeal to the next quarter-sessions, and then and there finally hear and determine the same.

indiscreetly and unadvisedly carried on: And whereas, by a clause in an Act, passed in the ninth year of the reign of King George the First, intituled, An Act for the Amendment of the Laws relating to the Settlement,

4 Employment, and Relief of the Poor, power is given to the churchwardens and overseers, in the manner therein mentioned, to purchase or hire houses, and contract with any person for the lodging, keeping, maintaining, and employing the poor, and taking the benefit of their work, labour,

4 and service, for their maintenance; and where any parish, town, or township, should be found too small, to unite two or more for those purposes,

4 with the consent of the major part of the parishioners or inhabitants, and the approbation of a justice of the peace; which provisions, from the w ant of proper regulations and management in the poorhouses or w orkhouses that have been purchased or hired under the authority of the said Act,

4 and for want of due inspection and controul over the persons who have engaged in those contracts, have not had the desired effect, but the poor,

4 in many places, instead of finding protection and relief, have been much oppressed therebyFor remedy of these grievances and inconveniences, ana m order to make better and more effectual provision for the relief and employment of the poor, and to introduce a prudent economy in the expenditure of the parish money; may it please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the twenty-fifth day of March, which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, so much of the said clause as respects the maintaining or hiring out the labour of the poor by contract, within any parish, township, or place, which shall adopt the provisions of this Act, shall be, and is hereby repealed, and every contract or agreement made in pursuance thereof, for either of those purposes,

4 towns, and districts, and for other the purposes of the said Acts; but such sums of money, for which such assessments are to be made, are by the said several Acts of Parliament limited so as that they may not exceed a certain sum in any one year, which sum was calculated upon an average of the amount of the poor’s rates in each parish respectively, for 4 a certain number of years previous to the passing of the respective incorporating Acts:And whereas, by reason of the late very great increase of the price of corn, and other necessary articles of life, the amount of the rates and assessments, so limited by the said several Acts of Parliament,

4 are become insufficient for the necessary relief and maintenance of the poor, who have also of late greatly increased in number:And whereas 4 m many incorporated hundreds, towns, and districts, the expence of maintaining the poor, since the first day of January one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, has exceeded the whole amount of the rates which could be raised in the present year within those hundreds, towns, and districts, under their respective incorporating Acts; whereby considerable debts have on that account been incurred by the guardians of the poor of those hundreds, towns, and districts: And it is therefore become necessary and expedient that the powers of the several persons to whom is committed, by the said several Acts of Parliament, the duty of appointing the sums to be assessed on the several parishes, hamlets, and places, 4 within their respective hundreds, towns, and districts, should be enlarged :* May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons,

WHEREAS by an Act passed in the ninth year of the reign of his late XVIIf

HERE AS by an Act of Parliament, made and passed in the seventeenth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the Second,

intituled, An Aetfor remedying some Defects in the Act made in theforty-c third Year of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, intituled, An Act for the Relief € of the Poor; power was given to justices of the peace, upon appeals from rates and assessments ', where they should see just cause to give relief, to amend the same in such manner only as should be necessary for giving

such relief, without altering such rates or assessments with respect to other persons mentioned in the same: And whereas the quashing or setting aside of rates or assessments made for the relief of the poor, is attended with great inconvenience; and it hath happened, in consequence of the rate or assessment being quashed or set aside, or of notice of appeal against the whole rate being given, the churchwardens and overseers of

the poor have not had any money in hand for the relief and maintenance

of the poor: For remedy whereof, may it please your Majesty that it may be enacted; ’ and be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same. That, from and after the passing of this Act, upon all appeals from any rate or assessment made for the relief of the poor of any parish, township, yill, or place, the court of general or quarter-sessions of the peace shall, and such court is hereby authorized and required (in all cases where they shall see just cause to give relief) to amend such rate or assessment, either by inserting therein or striking out the name or names of any person or persons, or by altering the sum or sums therein charged on any person or persons, or in any other manner which the said court shall think necessary for giving such relief, and without quashing or wholly setting aside such rate or assessment: Provided always, That if the said court shall be of opinion that it is necessary, for the purpose of giving relief to the person or persons appealing, that the rate or assessment should be wholly quashed, then the said court may quash the same (1); but nevertheless, all and every the sum and sums of money in

IL And be it further enacted, That, from and after the passing of this Act, all and every the sum and sums of money at which any person or persons is or are or shall be rated or assessed in any rate or assessment made for the relief of the poor of any parish, township, vill, or place, shall and may be levied and recovered by distress, and all other lawful ways and means, notwithstanding the person or persons so rated or assessed, or any other person or persons, shall have given notice of appeal from or against such rate or. assessment, for any cause whatsoever: Provided always, that if any person, rated or assessed in any rate or assessment made for the relief of the poor, shall give such notice of appeal as hereinafter mentioned* to the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of any parish, township, vill, or place, or any two of them, then, from and after the giving of such notice, and until the appeal shall have been heard and determined, no proceedings shall be commenced or carried on to recover any greater sum or sums of money from such person or persons, than the sum or sums at which he, she, or they, or any occupier of the same premises, shall have been rated or assessed in the last effective rate which shall have been collected in such parish, township, vill, or place.

III. And be it further enacted, That in case the said court of general or quarter sessions of the peace shall upon appeal order any rate or assessment for the relief of the poor to be quashed, it shall be lawful for the said court to order that any sum or sums of money, in and by such rate or assessment charged on any person or persons, or any part of any such sum or sums, not to be paid, and then ana in every such case no proceedings shall, after making such order, be commenced; or if any proceedings have been previously commenced, such proceedings shall be no further prosecuted or carried on for the purpose of levying or enforcing the payment of any sum or sums which snail be so ordered by the said court not to be paid as aforesaid: Provided always, that no justice of the peace, constable, or other officer of the peace or other person shall he deemed a trespasser, or liable to any action, for any warrant, order, act, or thing, which such justice, constable, or other officer or person shall have granted, made, executed, or done, for the purpose of levying or enforcing the payment of any such sum or sums ot money before he shall have had notice in writing of the order for the non-payment of such sum or sums of money, which the said court is hereby authorized to make as aforesaid.

IV. And be it further enacted. That, from and after the passing of this Act, all notices of appeal from or against any rate or assessment made for the relief of the poor, or from or against the account of the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of any parish, township, vill, or place, shall be in writing, and shall be signed by the person or persons giving the same, or his, her, or their attorney, on his, her, or their behalf; and such notices of appeal shall be delivered to or left at the places of abode of the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of the parish, township, vill, or place, or any two of them, and the particular causes or grounds of appeal shall be stated and specified in such notice; and upon the hearing of any appeal from or against any such rate or assessment, or account, the court of general or quarter sessions to which such appeal shall be made, shall not examine or enquire into any other cause or ground of appeal than such as are or is stated and specified in the notice of appeal.

And it is hereby further enacted, That the clauses, powers, provisions, and directions contained in an Act passed in the twenty-second year of his present Majesty’s reign, intituled, An Act for the Relief and Employment of the Poor, for the purpose of enabling bodies politic, corporate trustees, guardians, and incapacitated persons, to contract for the sale of and to convey and lease lands, tenements, and hereditaments, for the purposes in that Act expressed, and for and with regard to the payment and application of the purchase money to be paid for the lands, tenements, and hereditaments to be purchased by virtue of the said Act, shall extend and be applied to all lands, tenements, and hereditaments, to be purchased, llifed, or taken for the purposes and under the authority of this Act, and to the payment and application of the purchase money for the same, as fully and effectually, to all intents and purposes, as if such clauses, powers, provisions, and directions were herein repeated and contained, and were hereby expressly enacted and applied to lands and buildings to be purchased and taken on lease for any of the purposes of this Act.

XIX. And whereas in many parishes, and more especially in large and populous towns, the payment of the poor’s rates is greatly evaded, by reason that great numbers of houses within such parishes are let out in lodgings, or in separate apartments, or for short terms, or are let out to tenants who quit their residences or become insolvent before the rates charged on them can be collected; and it hath been found, that in many instances the persons letting such houses do actually charge and receive much higher rents for the same, upon the ground and expectation that the occupiers thereof cannot be effectually assessed to the poor's rates, and will not be charged with or required to pay such rates, and do thus obtain an undue advantage to themselves, ancr by means of the premises the other inhabitants ofsuch parishes are unjustly compelled to pay much more than their fair and due proportion of the charges of relieving and maintaining the poor) for remedy thereof be it further enacted, That from and after the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and twenty, it shall be lawful for the inhabitants of any parish, in vestry assembled, and they are hereby empowered, to resolve and direct, that the owner or owners of all houses, apart menu, or dwellings in such parishes, being the immediate lessor or lessors of the actual occupier or occupiers, which shall respectively be let iq the occupiers thereof at any rent or rate not exceeding twenty pounds, POf less than six pounds by the year, for any less term than one year, or on any agreement by which the rent shall be reserved or made payable at any shorter period than three months, shall be assessed to the rates for the relief of the poor, for or in respect of such houses, apartments, or dwellings, and the outhouses and curtilages thereof, instead of the actual occupiers; and the inhabitants so assembled in vestry may and they are hereby authorized from time to time to rescind, renew, vary, and amend every such resolution and direction as they shall see occasion, so as no such resolution or direction shall extend to assess or charge the owner of any house, apartment, or dwelling which shall with the outhouses and curtilages thereof be let at a greater rent than twenty pounds or less than six pounds as aforesaid; and the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of every such palish are hereby empowered and required to carry into effect all such resolutions and directions of the inhabitants in vestry assembled, and in pursuance sad execution thereof, in all rates to be by them made for the relief of the poor, to assess by a fair and equal pound rate the owner or owners, being the immediate lessor or lessors of the actual occupier or occupiers, of every house, apartment, or dwelling to which such resolution and direction shall extend, tor or in respect of the same, according to the actual rent at which

XXIII. Provided, and be it further enacted, That nothing in this Act contained shall extend or be construed to extend to give any power or authority to assess the owner (not being the occupier) of any nouse, apartment, or dwelling, in any city, borough, or town corporate, in which the right of voting for the election of members to serve in Parliament shall do-pend upon the assessment of the voter to the poor’s rate, or to vary or affect the manner of assessing and charring any of the inhabitants or occupiers of houses, lands or tenements, within any such city, borough, or town corporate.

XXIV. And whereas difficulties having frequently arisen, and considerable expences have sometimes been incurred, by reason of the refusal of persons who have been permitted to occupy, or who have intruded themselves into parish or town houses, or other tenements or dwellings built or provided for the habitation of the poor, or otherwise belonging to such parishes, to deliver up the possession of such houses, tenements, or dwellings, when thereto required; and it is expedient to provide a remedy for the same; be it further enacted, That if any person who shall have been

XXV. And be it further enacted, That if any person to whom any land appropriated, purchased, or taken under the authority of this Act, for the employment of the poor of any parish, or to whom any other lands belonging to such parish, or to the churchwardens and overseers thereof, or to either of them, shall have been let for his or her own occupation, shall refuse to quit and to deliver up the possession thereof to the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of such parish, at the expiration of the term for which the same shall have been demised or let to nim or her; or if any person or persons shall unlawfully enter upon, or take or hold possession Of any such land, or any other land or hereditaments belonging to such parish, or to the churchwardens or overseers, or to either of them, it shall be lawful for such churchwardens and overseers of the poor, or any of them, after such notice and demand of possession as is by this Act directed in the case of parish hcuses, to exhibit a complaint against the person or persons hi possession of such land, before two or his Majesty’s justices of the peace, who are hereby authorized and required to proceed thereon, and to near and determine the matter thereof, and if they shall find and adjudge the same to be true, to cause possession of such land to be delivered to the churchwardens and overseers of the poor, or some of them, in such and the like course and manner as are by this Act directed with regard to parish houses.

XXVI. And whereas by the said Act passed in the forty-third year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, for the relief of the poor, it was enacted, that the father and grandfather, and the mother and grandmother, and the children of every poor, old, blind, lame, and impotent person, or other poor person, not able to work, being of a sufficient ability, shall at their own charges relieve and maintain every such poor person, in that manner and according to that rate as by the justices of the peace of that county where such sufficient persons dwell, or the greater number of them, at their general quarter session, shall be assessed:And whereas it is expedient ro extend the power which is by the said Act given to justices in their general quarter sessions, to justices in petty sessions: Be it further enacted, That'it shall be lawful for any two or more of his Majesty’s justices of the peace, for the county or other Jurisdiction in which any suen sufficient person shall dwell, and they are hereby empowered, in any petty session, to make such assessment and order for the relief of every poor, old, blin'd, lame, impotent, or other poor person not able to work, upon and by the father, grandfather, mother* grandmother, or child (being ot sufficient ability) of every such poor person, as may by virtue of the said Act be made by the justices in their ger

XXVII. And whereas by the said Act passed in the twenty-second year of his present Majesty’s reign, for the better relief and employment of the poor, it is enacted, with regard to parishes which have adopted the provisions thereof, and for which a visitor shall have been appointed, that no guardian of the poor shall be summoned to appear before any justice of the peace, upon complaint or application to such justice for the relief of any poor person, unless application shall have been first made by the person so complaining to the guardian, and upon his refusal of redress, to the visitor: And whereas in many cases, by reason of the absence of the visitor, or the distance of his residence, it may not be in the power of the complainant to make foe application by foe said Act required; for remedy thereof be it further enacted, That if it shall be made to appear to any justice to whom aay such complaint or application for relief shall be made, that foe visitor of dm parish or united parishes from which relief shall be sought is absent from home, or is resident more than six miles from the place of abode of the complainant, and that application for relief hath been made to the guardian, and hath been refused, it shall be lawful for such justice to summon foe guardian to appear before him to answer such complaint, and to proceed thereon and make such order therein as the case shall require, in like manner as in cases where application hath been made to the visitor in the manner by the said Act directed.

XXIX. And whereas it is expedient to discourage that reliance upon the poor's rates which frequently induces artisans, labourers, and others, to squander away earnings which would with suitable care have afforded sufficient means for the support of their families; be it "further enacted, That whenever it shall appear to the justices, or to the general or select vestry, or to such guardians, governors, or directors as aforesaid, or to the overseers of foe poor, to whom application shall be made for relief for any poor person, that ne might, but for nis extravagance, neglect, or wilful misconduct, have been able to maintain himself, or to support his family (as the case may be), it shall be lawful for the overseers of the poor (by the direction of the justices, or of the general or select vestry, or of such guardians, governors or directors, where application shall have been made to them respectively), to advance money weekly or otherwise, as may be requisite, to toe person so applying, by way of loan only, and to take his receipt for, and engagement to repay every sum to be so advanced (for which no stamp duty shall be required); and it shall be lawful for any two justices, upon the application (within one yefer after any such loan or loans) of one or more of the overseers of the poor for foe time being of the parish, to summon the person to whom any money shall have been so advanced; and if, upon examination by such justices into his circumstances, it shall djppear to them that such person is able, by weekly instalments or otherwise, to repay the whole or any part of the money so advanced to him, and for which ho shall have given any such receipt and engagement, it shall be lawful for such justices to make an order under their hands and seals for foe repayment of the whole or of any part of such money, at such time and times and in such proportions and manner as they shall see fit; and upon every default of payment, by their warrant io commit such person to the conupon

And be k further enacted, That when any person entitled to or in receipt of any pennon, superannuation, or other allowance, in respect of his service in the navy, royal marines, army, or ordnance, shall apply to any parish for relief, for himself, or for his wile or family, it shall be lawful for the churchwardens and overseers of the poor to require the pensioner or other person applying for relief, before the same shall be granted, to assign to them the next quarterly or other payment or allowance which shall become payable to him, to the intent that they may receive the same, and retain for the use of the parish so much thereof as shall have been by them advanced for the relief of such pensioner, or other person, or of his wife or family residing with him in such parish; and it shall also he lawful for the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of any parish, at the request of any person who shall be entitled to or in receipt of any sutji pension, superannuation, or other allowance, to advance for his support, or the support of his family, any weekly sum not exceeding the rate ot his pension or allowance, to be repaid by and out of the next quarterly or other payment of such pension or allowance, and to take an assignment thereof by way of security for the money so to be advanced, any thing in any Act or Acts to the contrary notwithstanding; and every assignment to be made of any such pension, superannuation, or allowance, for the purposes of this Act, shall be exempt from stamp duty, and shall be in the form or to the effect following; that is to say,

XXXI. And be it further enacted, That when any pensioner, or other person entitled to or in receipt of any such pension or other allowance as aforesaid, shall leave his wife or family chargeable, or suffer them to become chargeable to any parish, it shall be lawful for two or more justices, upon complaint thereof to them made by any one or more of the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of such parish, and verified on oath, by order under their hands and seals to direct that the next payment which shall become due of such pension or other allowance shall be made to the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of the parish to which such wife or family shall have become chargeable; and any one or more of such churchwardens and overseers of the poor shall transmit such order to the afore-sail commissioners for the affairs of the royal hospitals at Chelsea or Greenwich, or the secretary of the board of ordnance respectively, in like manner as any assignment is herein-before directed to be transmitted to the paymaster general of his Majesty’s forces, and the paymaster of pensions at Greenwich, the paymaster of the royal marines, and the secretary of the board of ordnance, as the case may be; which said paymaster general, or paymaster of pensions at Greenwich, or the treasurer of the board of ordnance, shall thereupon, and upon sufficient proof being given that the person whose pension or other allowance shall be directed to be paid shall nave been living when the same shall become payable, and would have been entitled to receive the same if no such order had been made, causa the said payment to be made to the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of the parish for whose security such order shall have been made; and the churchwardens and overseers of the poor receiving any such pension or other allowance by virtue of any such order, shall retain and apply the same, or so much thereof as shall have been actually expended for the purposes aforesaid, for the use and indemnity of the parish, and shall pay the overplus (if any there shall be) to the pensioner or person entitled thereto; and upon the receipt of any such order as aforesaid, by which the pension or other allowance to be mentioned .therein, shall be directed to be paid to such churchwardens and overseers as aforesaid, the payment thereof shall be suspended, until sufficient proof shall have been given to entitle the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of the parish, in such order named, to receive the money thereby directed to be paid to them.

XXXII. And whereas in many instances the wives and families of seamen employed in the merchant service become chargeable to parishes, while their husbands and fathers are absent on such service, and it is expedient to provide for the indemnity of such parishes by and out of the wages of such seamen; be it therefore further enacted, That where the wife or family of any seaman employed in any voyage or trip (not being his Majesty’s service), shall, during his absence on any such employment, become chargeable to any parish, it shall be lawful for two justices, upon complaint thereof to them made by any one or more of the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of such parish, and verified on oath, by order under their hands ana seals, to direct the acting owner or owners, ship’s husband, or agent of the ship or vessel in which such seaman shall be employed, to pay, out of the wages which shall become due to such seaman, unto the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of the parish to which his wife or family shall have become chargeable, so much as shall have been by such parish necessarily expended for the maintenance or relief (the amount, in case of any dispute, to be ascertained by two justices, whose determination thereon shall he final); and upon the production of any

HERE AS by an Act made in the third year of the reign of King WiU No. VIII. (a) Horn and Queen Mary, intituled, An Act for the better Explanation, n jr and supplying the Defects of the former Laws for the Settlement of the .

Poor, it is enacted, That if any person shall be bound an apprentice by c. 11indenture, and inhabit in any town or parish, such binding and inhabitation shall be adjudged a good settlement: And whereas since the making the said Act, great numbers of persons have been unwarily bound apprentices by certain deeds, writings, or contracts, not indented, by which binding many of them have suffered great loss and damage, on account of their having been refused a settlement in such town or parish, where they have been so bound and resided forty days, and have been removed to the parish or place where their last legal settlement was before such apprenticeship, where they have had no encouragement to exercise their trades, or opportunity to gain a livelihood by their said trades to which they were so bound apprentices: For relief therefore of such apprentices, and for preventing the like mischief for the future; be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That no person who shall have been bound an apprentice^ or who shall hereafter be bound an apprentice, £y any deed, writing, or contract, not indented, 'being first legally stamped, shall be liable to be removed from the town, parish, or place, where he or she shall have been so bound an apprentice, and resident forty days, by virtue of any order of removal, granted by two justices of the peace, of any county, riding, division, city, borough, town corporate, or place; or by virtue of any order of the justices at their general or quarter sessions, by reason or on account of such deed, writing, or contract, not being indented only.

Provided nevertheless, That nothing herein-before enacted, shall extend, or be construed to extend, to set aside or make void, any judgement, order, or decree, which shall have been made as aforesaid, before the first day of May, one thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight.

And whereas by an Act passed in the twentieth year of his present Majesty’s reign, intituled, An Act for the better adjusting and more easy Recovery of the Wages of certain Servants, and for the better Regulation of such Servants, and of certain Apprentices; it is enacted. That from and after the twenty-fifth day of March, one thousand seven hundred and forty-seven, all complaints, differences, and disputes, which shall arise between masters or mistresses, and servants in husbandry, who shall be hired for one year or longer, or which shall happen or arise between masters and mistresses and artificers, handicraftsmen, miners, colters, keelmen, pitmen, classmen, potters, and other labourers, employed for uiy certain time, or in any other manner, shall be heard or determined by one or more justice or justices of the peace, for the place where such master or mistress shall inhabit: And whereas doubts have arisen whether the words any labourers employed for any certain time, or in any other manner, extend to servants in husbandry hired for a less time than one year; for obviating the said doubts, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the said Act, and all and every clause and matter therein contained, shall from and after the said first day of May, one thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight, be deemed and construed to extend to all servants employed in husbandry, though hired for a less time than one year; any thing in the said recited Act of the twentieth year of his present Majesty’s reign, or any other Act contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

or embezzled, are frequently received by persons knowing the same to

have been so purloined or embezzled; and such materials being afterwards worked up, or otherwise disposed of, renders it difficult to convict c such offenders :r Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy seven, when any person or persons shall be brought or charged upon oath before any two or more justices of the peace, by virtue of this Act, with being suspected of, or with having purloined or embezzled, or with having received any such materials as aforesaid, whether the same be wrought or unwrought, mixed or unmixed, knowing the same to have been either purloined or embezzled, or received from some person or persons not intitled to dispose thereof, and it shall be made appear upon the oath, or (being of the people called Quakers) upon the affirmation, of one or more credible witness or witnesses, to the satisfaction of such justices, that such person or persons hath or have purloined or embezzled, or hath or have received any such materials as aforesaid, knowing the same to have been purloined or embezzled, or received from some person or persons not intitled to dispose thereof, it shall and may be lawful for such justices, or for the justices at their general or general quarter sessions of the peace, and they are hereby respectively authorized and empowered (if they shall think fit) to convict such person or persons of having purloined or embezzled, or of having received such materials as aforesaid, knowing the same to have been purloined or embezzled, or received from some person or persons not intitled to dispose thereof, although no proof shall be given to whom such materials belong; and the person or persons so convicted shall, for every such offence, be subject to such and the like penalties and punishments, at the discretion of sden justices respectively, as persons convicted of buying or receiving any such materials as aforesaid, knowing the same to have been purloined or embezzled, are by this Act subject and liable to.

ment for' not returning such materials the same as for purloining or embezzling under this Act; * Be it therefore further enacted, That from and Altered after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventyseven, so much of the said recited Act as allows twenty-one days after the preparing, working up, or manufacturing the said materials, for returning so much of the said materials as shall not be used in such preparing, working up, or manufacturing, and declares that the punishment for not so returning the said materials within the said time, shall be the same as under the said Act is directed for purloining or embezzling, shall be repealed; and only eight days shall be allowed for returning the said materials in manner aforesaid; and the punishment for not returning them within the said eight days shall be the same as is by this Act directed to be inflicted for purloining or embezzling.

VIII. And whereas, by the said Act of the twenty-second year of the

reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, it is enacted. That,

from and after the said twenty-fourth day of June one thousand seven

hundred and forty-nine, if any person who should be hired, retained, or employed, to prepare or work up any of the manufactures therein before

thereof, by procuring or permitting himself or herself to be subsequently (retained or employed by any other master or person whatsoever, before he or she should have completed the work which he or she was first and

originally so hired, retained, or employed to perform, and which was first

delivered to him or her; then, and in every such case, the person so offending, being thereof lawfully convicted by the oath, or (being of the

people called Quakers) affirmation, of one or more credible witness or witnesses, before one or more justice or justices of the peace of the county, riding, division, city, liberty, town, or place, where the offence or

offences should be committed should be sent to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour for any time not exceeding one month:

4 And whereas the said provision contained in the said recited clause is not found sufficient for the purpose intended, and it is apprehended that some other provision, more proper, may be made* Be it therefore further enacted, That from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, the whole of the said last recited clause shall be

repealed; and that from and after the said first day of July one thousand andrepealed. seven hundred and seventy-seven, if any person being hired, retained, or Any person employed, to prepare or work up any materials, whether mixed or unmix- employed to ed, for any master or masters, snail wilfully neglect or refuse the perform- work up mate-ance thereof for eight days successively; or having taken in any materials, rials, who shall whether mixed or unmixed, for manufacture, from one master, or two or neglect to per-more masters, being copartners, shall afterwards take in any materials, fo arae ^or whether mixed or unmixed, for manufacture, from any other master or CJ. masters; or shall procure, or permit himself or herself to be employed or v sent to retained in any other occupation or employment whatsoever, sooner than V 0 eight days before the completion of the work first taken; then, in every such case, such person being thereof lawfully convicted by the oath, or (being of the people called Quakers) affirmation of one or more credible witness or witnesses, before two or more justices of the peace of the county, riding, division, city, liberty, town, or place, where the offence or offences shall be committed, shall be sent to the house of correction, or other publick prison, there to be kept to hard* labour for any time not exceeding three months, nor less than one month.

And whereas it frequently happens that persons receive the said materials in fictitious names, in order to be manufactured; and that persons receive such materials in their own names, in order to be manufactured by themselves, and afterwards deliver the same to others to be>ma-4 nufactured, without the knowledge or consent of the owners thereof; and that carriers, or other persons employed to deliver materials to workmen

of the same; and whereas the discovery and conviction of the purlomers and embezzlers, buyers and receivers, of such materials, is full of difficulty, 4 from the close and clandestine manner in which the offence is committed; and there is still greater difficulty in proving whose property such materials are; and it would tend to the discouragement and suppression of such offences, if the discovery and conviction of such offenders were rendered more easy:And whereas, by the said recited Act of the twentysecond year of his late Majesty King George the Second, justices of the

peace, after conviction of any offender for purloining or embezzling the said materials, or for buying or receiving the same, are authorised to grant warrants for searching the houses and other places of the persons so convicted, but no such authority is given before conviction, nor in any other house or place, except such as belongs to a person convicted* Be it therefore further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for any two justices of the peace of any county, riding, division, city, liberty, town, or place, upon complaint made to them, upon oath, by any one credible person, or (being of the people called Quakers) upon solemn affirmation, that there is cause to suspect that any such purloined or embezzled materials, whether mixed or unmixed, wrought or unwrought, are concealed in any dwelling house, out house, yard, garden, or other place or places, by virtue of a warrant under their hands and seals, to cause every such dwelling house, out house, yard, garden, or place, to be searched m the day time: And if any such materials, suspected to be purloined or embezzled, shall be found therein, to cause the same, and the person or persons in whose house, out house, yard, garden, or other place, the same snail be found, to be brought before any two justices of the peace for the same county, riding, division, city, liberty, town, or place; and if the said person or persons, shall not give an account, to the satisfaction of such justices, how ne, she, or they came by the same, then the said person or persons so offending, shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished in manner herein-after mentioned, although no proof shall be given to whom such materials belong.

XX. And whereas the said Act, of the twenty-second year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, only gives an appeal from an order of any justice or justices of the peace to the general or general quarter-sessions of the peace, where an order i6 made by any justice or justices of the peace, in the case of the buyer or receiver of such purloined or embezzled materials as aforesaid, and in respect to the sale or disposal of such materials found on searching by warrant, after any conviction for purloining dr embezzling, or for receiving or buying such purloined or embezzled materials: And whereas it is thought more proper to give a right of appealing in the case of other orders of any justice or justices of the peace, to be* made by force of an Act, made in the twelfth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the First,

4 intituled, An Act to prevent unlawful Combinations of Workmen employed in the Woollen Manufactures, and for better Payment of their Wages, and of the said Act, and also in the case of all orders to be made by any justices of the peace under this Act; * Be it therefore further enacted, That if any person shall think himself or herself aggrieved by the order or judgment of any two justices before whom he or she shall have been convicted of any of the offences in the said ^cts of the twelfth year of the reign of King George the First, and the twenty-second year of the reign of King George the Second, or in this Act, such person may appeal, and the said justices are hereby required to make known to such person, at the time of such conviction, his or her right to appeal, to the next general or general qfearter-sessions of the peace to be holden for the county, riding, division, city, liberty, town, or place, where such conviction shall have been made (such person at the time of such conviction, giving to such justices notice in writing of his or her -intention to appeal, and also entering into a recognizance, at the time of such notice, with sufficient sureties, conditioned to try such appeal, and to abide the judgment of, and pay such costs as shall be awarded by, the justices at such sessions); but if the person giving such notice of appeal shall not, at the time of giving such notice, enter into such recognizance as aforesaid, then the justices, to whom such notice of appeal shall have been given, shall and may commit such person or persons to the house of correction, or other pub-lick prison, of such county, riding, division, city, liberty, town, or place, there to remain until the said next general or general quarter-sessions of the peace to be holden in and for such place, unless such recognizance shall be sooner entered into; and the said justices before whom such conviction shall have been made, or any other two or more justices of the same county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place, are hereby impowered and required to take; and the justices at such sessions are hereby authorized and required upon due proof made of such notice of appeal, either by the acknowledgment of* the justices to whom the same shall have been given, or otherwise, to hear and determine the matter of the said appeal, and to award such costs as to them shall appear just and reasonable, to be paid by either party: And if, upon the hearing of 6uch appeal, the judgment of the justices to whom the appellant shall have been convicted shall be affirmed, such appellant shall, within forty-eight hours next after the same shall be so affirmed, suffer such corporal punishment as shall have been directed to be inflicted upon him or her for the offence whereof he or she shall have been convictea, or shall immediClass XXXI.] Seroartls.

ately pay the sum which he or she shall have been adjudged to forfeit, together with such costs as the justices in the said sessions shall award to be paid by him or her, for defraying the expences sustained by the defendant or defendants in such appeal; or, in default of making such payment, shall be committed to the common gaol, or house of correction, in the same manner, and for the same time, to be computed from the affirmance of such conviction, as shall be directed by the original judgment of conviction, unless the person or persons so convicted shall have been imprisoned under the original conviction, in which case the time for which such person or persons shall have been so confined shall be included in the order of confirmation.

XXI. And whereas an Act, passed in the twenty-third year of the 1 reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, intituled, An Act for the more effectually punishing of Persons convicted of seducing Artificers

m the Manufactures of Great Britain or Ireland, out of the Dominions of

the Crown of Great Britain; and to prevent the Exportation of Utensils

made use of in the Woollen and Silk Manufactures, from Great Britain or

Ireland into Foreign Parts; and for the more -easy and speedy Determina-(tion of Appeals, allowed in certain Cases by an Act made in the last Session of Parliamenty relating to Persons employed in the several Manufao

tares therein mentioned; prescribes a form for conviction of the several offences mentioned in die said recited Act of the twenty-second of George

the Second; but such form is not adapted to the said last-mentioned Act,

as altered by this Act; and it may, be useful to have one general form for

the said recited Act of the twenty-second of George the Second, and this

Act; * Be it therefore further enacted, That in respect to all offences which, from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, shall be committed against the said recited Act of the twenty-second of George the Second, so much of the said Act of the twenty-third of George the Second as prescribes a form of conviction for offence s, against the said Act of the twenty-second of George the second,

shall be repealed; and that, from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, the justices before whom any offender shall be convicted of any offence, either against the said Act of the twenty-second of George the Second, or varied by this Act, or against thin Act, shall cause the conviction to be certified to the next general or general quarter-session of the peace to be held in and for the county, riding, division, city, liberty, town, or place, where such conviction was made, to be filed with the records of such sessions; and such conviction shall and may be drawn up and written on parchment, and certified in the following form of words, as far as the name of the person and the nature of the case will admit of (that is to say);

(1) It will not be sufficient merely to follow this form of conviction, there being a discretionary punishment as to some of the offences included in the Act, and 1 have known many convictions quashed for want of sufficient cer-Uintyrin the adjudication.

Where there is a discretion as to the duration of imprisonment to be suffered for want of distress, as in cases depending upon section 4, the general practice of the sessions has been to require such imprisonment to appear on the face of the conviction, and it seems to be necessary that it should so jq>pear. Upon a conviction under that section, it may be proper after stating the offence, to proceed as follows:—“ And we do adjudge, that for the said offence, being his first offence, the said John Smith hath forfeited the stun of 40L which we direct shall be applied as follows; that is to say, —

It is to be observed that section 20, which gives the appeal, directs, that In default of payment of the penalty, on affirmance of the conviction, the party is to be committed for the same time as shall be directed upon the original judgment of conviction.

Upon a proceeding under sections 10 and 12, the following form seems to be proper:

Lancashire)BE it remembered, That on the 1st day of June, in the year

Z. being a credible parson, that there was cause to suspect that certain purloined had embezzled materials of cottoa were concealed in the dwelling-house of the said John Smith, at Manchester aforesaid, by virtue of a warrant under their hands and seals, pursuant to the statute in such case made and provided, did cause the said dwelling-house to be searched in the day-time, and that upon such search certain materials, used in the manufacture of cotton, to wit, 50 lbs. weight of cotton wool, suspected to be purloined or embezzled, were found in the same dwef-ling-house (a), and the said materials so found as aforesaid, and the said John Smith, were thereupon, to wit, on the said first day of A#*.y, brought before os the said justices first above named; and the said John Smith being so brought before us, the said last-mentioned justices, did request of us to appoint a reasonable time to produce one 1.

Provided also, and be it further enacted, That nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend, to repeal any former law or laws now in being, for the punishment of any of the offences herein above specified, except so for as is particularly expressed by this Act; and n6 offender who shall have been proceeded against, upon or by virtue of this Act, for any of the offences herein specified, shall for the same offence be afterwards proceeded against, upon orby virtue of any such former law or laws.

(a) [In all the editions of Burn, instead of following the provisions of the statute, sec. 8, imposing a penalty on the person in whose Aov*e, outhouse, yard, garden, or other place, the materials shall be found, the word possession is substituted. I have many years ago known a case determined upon reference by the'sessions to the present Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, then at the bar, which turned entirely upon that difference, the materials having been found in thq possession of a married woman, (in a box in her pecnliar custody) to which the husband was not supposed to be privy, and the conviction of the wife could not be supported, which it was held that it might have been, if the expression in Burn had been that of the Act.]

(b) [As the duration of imprisonment for non-payment of the penal* ty Is in this case limited, it does not seem necessary that it should he expressed in the conviction, I have seen a form of conviction, in which directions were contained for advertising and disposing of the property pursuant to section 13; bnt I conceive it is not necessary or usual that such directions shall form a part of the conviction, and that it would be preferable that they should be given by a separate order in writing J—See a form of conviction for embezzlement under sec. 3, Paley on Convictions, Appx. [79.]

It may here not be inrevelant to observe, with respect to convictions generally, that it has been customary in the practice of quarter-sessions, if any objection appeared on the fate of the conviction, to take it at the outset of the hearing, and if'the judgment of the court was in favour of the objection, any examination' of the merits has been considered unnecessary: but this course cannot safely be pursued, since the case of the King v. Allen, 15 EX 333, in which the sessions having quashed a conviction upon grounds which appeared to the Court of King’s Bench insufficient, the court refused to send the case down again to be heard ou its merits, and said, that as the defendant bad chosen to stand upon the objection which he then took, he 'had waved entering into the merits of the case upon the appeal. '

This certainly seems to have been rather a hard measure; as it has always been considered as the duty of counsel to take such objections as appeared to them to he tenable, or attended with a reasonable probability of success in point of form, however strong an opinion they might entertain in favour of their client upon the merits; and there is no reason which requires that if there are several points in a case, the insisting upon some shall be regarded as a waver of others. If the objection had been overruled by the sessions. It would have been quite contrary to all practice to have considered the taking it as a ground for refusing to proceed with the hearing upon the merits; and the case has not gone so far as to preclude the appellants counsel from urging the objections on the face of the proceedings, and going, at the same time, into a case upon the facts. “

It will be recollected that the clause for taking away a Certiorari does not extend tothepresecutor, unless particularly expressed -

Magistrates to divide the Court of Quarter Sessions.— [\9th May 1819.]

IIRREAS the courts of quarter session, by reason of the great increase of business therein, have of late been occupied during many days, to the great delay of suitors, to the inconvenience of witnesses and jurors, and to the increase of the county rates; and such inconvenience is likely to continue unless some remedy be provided for the same: And whereas it would tend materially to remedy this inconvenience, if two or more of the justices attending the quarter sessions, should be enabled to sit and proceed, when occasion should so require, while other justices should proceed in the dispatch of the other business of the same court: Be it therefore declared and enacted by the king’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That whenever and as often as any court of quarter session or general Session of the peace shall be assembled for the dispatch of business thereunto belonging, the justices then present may on the first day of their being so assembled, take into their consideration the state of the business likely to be brought before them at such quarter session or general session; and if it shall appear to them that such business, if heard and determined by the whole court, is likely to occupy more than three days, including the day of their being so assembled, it shall and may be lawful for the said justices to ap|»oint two or more justices, one of whom shall be of the quorum, to sit apart from themselves in some place in or near the court, there to hear and determine such business as shall be referred to them, whilst others of the justices are at the same time proceed ing in the dispatch of the other business of the same court; and that the proceedings so had by and before such two or more justices so sitting apart shall be as good and effectual in the law to all intents and purposes as it the same were nad before the court assembled and sitting &9 usual in its ordinary place of sitting, and shall be inrolled and recorded accordingly.

II. Provided always, and be it further enacted, That when two or more justices shall have sat apart in manner before directed by this Act, and orders, rules, and regulations shall have been made for the apportionment of business, such orders, rules, and regulations shall remain anu continue in force as long as shall be thought expedient without the necessity of renewing such orders, rules, and regulations at each succeeding session, to the intent

that the same may become public and better known to all professional and other persons engaged in or in any manner interested in the business of such quarter session.

III. And be it further enacted, That the clerk of the peace or his deputy (wherever two or more justices shall sit apart at any quarter session) shall be authorized and required to appoint a ht and sufficient person to record the proceedings so had before the justices sitting apart; and such proceedings shall ne delivered over to the clerk of the peace, or his deputy, and shall be equally deemed to be a part of the records of such session, as if the same proceedings had been recorded by the clerk of the peace himself; and it shall be lawful for the justices assembled at the quarter session to make an order upon the treasurer of the county to pay to the clerk of the peace such sum or sums of money as they shall deem a fit and reasonable remuneration to the clerk of the peace for such purpose as aforesaid; and ii shall be lawful for such justices to appoint an additional cryer, and to grant him such remuneration for his care and pains as they shall deem rea-aonable, which shall in like manner be paid by the treasurer of the county,

II ERE AS the holding of petty sessions by justices of the peace in Ireland has been found conducive to a better administration of the laws, and to the general interests of his Majesty’s subjects within that part of the United Kingdom: And whereas it is expedient to afford additional facilities for holding such petty sessions, and for securing a uniform and effectual mode of procedure therein:Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful to and for the justices of the peace, save and except within the county of Cork, within their respective jurisdictions, at the January sessions to be holden next after the passing of this Act, to divide the county, county of a city, or county of a town, for which such sessions shall Dfe holden, into such districts, for the purposes of this Act, as to them shall seem most expedient, fixing within every such district a place or places wherein the petty sessions shall be holden for such districts respectively.

II. And whereas in certain parts of Ireland it may not be practicable to procure the constant attendance of a sufficient number of justices of the peace to constitute petty sessions; be it enacted, That in case the justices of the peace oF any county so assembled shall be of opinion that any part of such county ought not to be included in any district for the purposes of this Act, it shall and may be lawful for such justices to make an order to that effect, and then and in such case the provisions of this Act shall not extend to such part or parts of any county as shall in such order be declared not to be included in any district.

III, And be it further enacted, That an order in writing shall be made by the said courts of quarter sessions assembled as aforesaid, specifying the boundaries of each and every such district, and of every part or parts of any county which shall not be included in any district, and the names of every place fixed for the holding of petty sessions; which order shall be entered in the crown book by the respective clerks of the peace, and a certified copy of such order transmitted by such clerk of the peace to the respective secretaries to the grand juries, and shall be laid before the several grand juries at the spring assizes then next ensuing, and in the county of Dublin at the next ensuing presenting term, and shall be printed with the presentments granted at such spring assizes;

V. And whereas by an Act passed in the fourth year of his present Majesty’s reign, intituled An Act to divide the County of Cork, for the purpose of holding additional Sessions therein, the said county is divided luto two parts; be it enacted, That for the purposes of carrying the present Act into execution within the said county, by dividing the said county into districts for the holding of petty sessions, and fixing the places wherein such petty sessions shall be nolden, or making any alterations therein, the several Acts hereby directed to be done by the justices of the peace at the January quarter sessions, shall in the county of Cork be performed at a general Meeting of magistrates of the said county to be held in the city of Cork on the second day of the summer assizes nest after the passing of this Act, or next after the serving any such notice at the October quarter sessions as aforesaid.

VI. And whereas for the due execution of justice on the borders of adjoining counties it has been found expedient to appoint some persons to be justices of the peace for two or more counties, and such justices have hitherto held petty sessions of the peace at some convenient place of one county on the borders of some other county or counties, and it might be attended with considerable inconvenience if such practice should be discontinued; be it therefore enacted, That it shall be lawful for the justices of the peace acting within any county, county of a city, or county of a town, in the execution of this Act, to appropriate any district of any such county adjoining any other county as part of a district of such adjoining county, wherein petty sessions shall be holden in pursuance of this Act, at suen place as shall have been or shall be fixed for that purpose in pursuance of this Act, such place not being at a greater distance than five miles from any part of the district in a different county to be annexed as aforesaid, and such annexation being made in the same manner as the appropriation of any district for the purpose of holding petty sessions of the peace is directed to be made by this Act; and such appropriation shall be entered and certified in the same manner as the several other districts within the same county are required to be entered and certified by this Act; and all other proceedings shall be had respecting such district as by this Act are provided concerning any other district within such county; and such appropriation shall also be certified to the court of quarter sessions for the county to or district of which such part of another county shall be so appropriated, and all proceedings shall be had thereupon as if suoh part of a county so appropriated to a district in another county had been within such last-mentioned county: Provided always, that such proceedings shall be only before justices of the peace qualified to act For the county to which such appropriated district shall properly belong, and shall be considered as if actually done within such county,

VAGRANTS.

[No. I.] 7 James I. c. 4.—An Act for the due Execution of divers Laws and Statutes heretofore made against Rogues, Vagabonds, and sturdy Beggars, and other lewd and idle Persons.

[Inserted ante. Title Gaols and Houses of Correction, Class XXI. No. 7.]

Some of our ancient statutes contain very severe regulations respecting vagrancy. By stat. 22 Henry VIII. c. 12. a vagrant, after being whipped, was to take an oath to return to the place where he was born, or where he has last dwelt before the punishment, for the space of three years, and there labour as a true man ought to do. Persons found a second time in a state of vagrancy were not only to be whipped, but to have the upper part of the gristle of the right ear clean cut off; for a third offence, the punishment was death. By 1 Edward VI. c. 3. a person adjudged to be a vagabond was to be marked with a hot iron on the breast with the mark of V. and adjudged to be a slave to the person who brought him for two years. The person was to keep him on bread, water, or small drink, and refuse meat, and cause him to work by beating, chaining, or otherwise. In any work or labour he pleased, be it ever so vile. If the slave absented himself for fourteen days, he was to be marked on the forehead or ball of the cheek with the sign of an , and adjudged to be a slave to his master for ever: and if he ran away a second time, was to be deemed a felon. Any child of the age of five years, and under

fourteen, might be adjudged to the apprehender till twenty-one if a female, and twenty-four if a male:the child to be treated as & slave, and punished with irons if he run away. If such slaves, either during their slavery, or after they were set free, beat or wounded their masters, or conspired with others so to do, they were to suffer as felons, unless the person injured would take the offender as a slave for ever.—The severity of this Act having prevented its being carried into execution, it was repealed by stat. 3 and 4. Edw. VI. c. 16. which ordained, that the ordering of vagrants shonld depend upon stat. 22 Henry VIII. By the 14 Elia. c. 5. and 18 Eliz. c. 3. provisions were made for the punishment of vagabonds, by gaoling, boring through the ears, and death in the second degree. These were repealed by 35 Eliz. c. 7. By stat. 12 and 13 Chas. II. c. 18. ante. Title Poor, a provision is made, which is still in force, for subjecting incorrigible rogues to transportation. General directions concerning vagrants, conformably to the principles of the present system, were given by statutes 12 Anne, st. 2, c. 23; 13 Geo. II. c. 24.

HERE AS the number of rogues, vagabonds, beggars, and other idle No. IT.

and disorderly persons, daily increases, to the great scandal, loss, j* q60

and annoyance of the KingdomFor remedy thereof, be it enacted by r r the King's most excellent Majesty, "by and with the advice and consent of

the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That all persons who Particular threaten to run away and leave their wives or children to the parish; and offences and all persons who shall unlawfully return to such parish or place from whence their they have been legally removed by order of two justices of the peace, (l) pnoishments. without bringing a certificate from the parish or place whereunto they belong; and also persons who, not having wherewith to maintain themselves, live idle without employment, and refuse to work for the usual and common wages given to other labourers in the like work, in the parishes or places where they then ore; and also all persons going about from door to door, or placing themselves in streets, highways, or passages, to beg or gather alms in the parishes or places where they dwell, shall be deemed idle and disorderly persons; and it shall and may be lawful for any justice of the peach to commit such offenders (being thereof convicted before him, by his own view, or by their own confession; or by the oath of one or more credible witness or witnesses) to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour for any time not exceeding one month: (2) And it Offences of a shall and may be lawful for any person to apprehend and carry before a higher nature, justice of the peace, any such persons going about from door to door, or placing themselves in streets, highways, or passages, to beg or gather alms m the parishes or places where they dwell; and if they shall resist, or escape from the person apprehending them, they shall be subject to the same punishment as rogues and vagabonds are made liable to by this Act:

And it shall and may be lawful for the said justice, by warrant under his Five shillings hand and seal, to order any overseer of the poor of the parish or place reward for where such offender shall be apprehended, to pay the sum of five shillings apprehending to any person or persons in any such parish or place so apprehending them, lenders, for every offender so apprehended; which sum shall be allowed to such overseer in his account, ne producing the justice’s order, and a receipt under the hand of the person or persons to whom such sum was paid: But Penalty on if such overseer shall neglect or refuse to pay the sai<} sum, the said jus- overseer, not tice, on oath thereof made, may by warrant under his hand and seal, order paying the the same to be levied by distress and sale of the goods of such overseer; *wrd. and the overplus (if any) after the charges of such distress satisfied, shall

(l) By stat. 13 and 14 Cbas. II. c. 12, see. 3, ante. Title Poor, persons removed returning of their own accord may be committed to the house of correction, there to be punished as a vagabond, or to a workhouse, to be employed in work or labour. A commitment for the offence of returning must be either according to the directions of that Act in the terms above specified; or, under the authority of this Act, to be kept to bard labour for a precise time, not exceeding a month; and a commitment nntil discharged by due course of law is illegal, and an action may be maintained against the justice; Baldwin v. Blackmore, 1 Bur. 595. A commitment for returning must state to what place the person returned; Rex v. Cole, 2 Bott. 683. The coming to reside on a tenement of 102. a year is not within the Act, which only prevents returning in a state of vagrancy; R. r, Fillingley, 2 T. R. 709. It is an important question, whether a single woman, removed as actually chargeable on account of being with child under the authority of 35 Geo. III. c. 101, ante. Title Poor, is punishable as a vagrant for returning after ner delivery ? I have always acted upon the impression that she is not, as the cause of removal is done away. In Burn, Title Poor, there is a note expressing an opinion that it is not advisable to commit the party returning nntil after the expiration of the time of appeal. But to this opinion I cannot by any means subscribe, as the order is clearly legal in every thing depending upon the execution of it, until re* versed. I apprehend that a subsequent reversal of the order would be no defence to the overseer, in a proceeding for not receive ing the paupers.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES *

A custom that a pound of butter shall weigh more or less than sixteen ounces is bad; but setnble. that it may be sold in lumps of eighteen ounces; Noble v. Dunell, 3 T. R. 271. Proposals are ofteu made for an uniformity of weights and measures, but the pertinacity with which the existing statutes are disregarded, and with which the inhabitants of different places adhere to the denominations to which they have been accustomed, renders it questionable whether any measure for that purpose would be attended with auy very extensive practical effect.

and measures long time used within this his realm, contrary to the

statute of Magna Charta, and of other statutes thereof made by divers

of his noble progenitors, at his great charge and cost did make weights

and measures of brass according to old standards thereof remaining

within his Treasury: And for that, that one weight and -one measure should be used throughout this his realm, in avoiding of all fraud and

discord in that behalf, it was at the last Parliament, holden the xiv.

day of October in the xj. year of our said Sovereign Lord’s reign, or-c darned, That the said measures and weights should be delivered to the knights and citizens of every shire and city assembled in the same Parliament, barons of the five ports, and certain burgesses of borough towns,

surely by them to be conveyed to certain cities, boroughs, and towns

specified in a Schedule unto the same Act annexed, there to remain for

ever, to the intent in the same Act more largely declared:which weights

and measures, upon more exigent examination had sith the making of

the said statute, been approved defective, and not made according to the old laws and statutes thereof ordained within the said realm wherefore the King our Sovereign Lord, by the assent of his Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, apd by authority of the same, ordaineth, establisheth, and enacteth. That the measure of a bushel contain viij. gallons of wheat, and that every gallon contain viij. li. of wheat of Troy weight, and every pound contain xij. ounces of Troy weight, and every ounce contain xx. sterlings, and every sterling be of the weight of xxxii. corns of wheat that grew in the midst of the ear of wheat, according to the old laws of this land. And that it pleaseth the King’s highness to make a standard of a bushel and a gallon after the said assize, to remain in his said treasury for ever; and from henceforth the said new bushels and gallons, lately sent forth, be not used nor occupied for no measures, but that they be sent again unto the King’s receipt by the feast of Whitsontide next coming, at the costs and charges of the said cities, boroughs, and towns, having the said bushels and gallons in keeping, upon pain of x li. to be forfeited to the King; the same bushels and gallons, so sent again into the King’s receipt, to be broken, and with the.stuff and metal of the same bushels and gallons, other new bushels and gallons, by the advice of the treasurer and under-treasurer of England for the time being, before the feast of All Saints next coming, to be made and sized according to the said bushel and gallon, which by this present Act

expressed be of none effect until the feast of Candlemas, which shall be

in the year of our Lord God one thousand four hundred and ninety-seven,

and after the same feast the same Act made in the same eleventh year to

stand in full strength, with its penalties, upon the said bushels and gallons

gallons made afore the making of this present Act, if this Act had not been

made. And that it be ordained by the said authority, That after the said All other

new bushels and gallons be made according to this present Act, that all bushels and

market hath been very grievous unto diters of his Majesty’s .most loving subjects, who have been much troubled by unnecessary summons,

and charged with exactions of divers sums of money, by colour of the

said office, and in regard the said evils have partly arisen by means of an

inequality of weights and measures throughout this kingdom, and by

granting and letting to farm the said office of clerk of the market and the

execution thereof, in and through ail or the most of the several counties of this kingdom, for great sums of money, which the said farmers or grantees, by their unjust and undue proceedings in the said office, do c extort from his Majesty’s subjects again, to their great impoverishment, 4 and yet little or no redress at all in their said weights and measures, or any benefit thereby accruing to his Majesty: For remedy whereof, and (for regulating of all weights and measures according to the true intent of this statute, and the other statutes in that behalf formerly made and provided, and preventing the said inconveniences: *

[No. XII.] 22 and 23 Charles II. c. 12.—An additional Act for ascertaining the Measures of Corn and Salt.

HERE AS notwithstanding there hath been great care taken in a late

Act, intituled, An Act for the ascertaining the Measures of Com and Salt throughout the Realm, yet the same is in a great measure avoided,

by selling m private places, as well as in publick markets, by the bag, or

without measuring, by the buyers shaking of the bushel before it be struck,

so that those places who have given obedience to the said Act are greatly prejudiced, and their markets likely to be lost by such undue practicesv

II. For prevention whereof, be it enacted by the King’s most‘excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, ' in this present Parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, That every person or persons, who shall from and after the five and twentieth day of March next sell or buy any corn ground or unground, or salt, by the bag, or without measuring, being thereunto required, or in any other manner than as is by the said Act directed, and that without shaking the said bushel or measure by the buyer (1), shall forfeit and lose, besiae the penalty of the former Act appointed (2), all corn* grain, or salt, bought or sold contrary to this Act or the value thereof, to the person or persons complaining.

III. And whereas a great cause of the mischief hereby intended to be prevented, doth arise by the selling in private places, and so avoiding, not only the intention of the said Act, but to the great damage of publick markets; * Be it further enacted, That upon complaint made to any one or more justices of the peace, that any kind of corn ground or unground, or salt, hath been sold, or bought, or delivered, contrary to this Act, the proof shall lie upon the defendant, to make it appear by the oaths of one or more credible witnesses, that he or they did sell or buy the same in every respect according to this and the said former Act, wherein if such person complained of shall fail, he or they shall forfeit and lose as is by this Act before directed, to be levied by distress and sale of his or their goods or chattels, restoring the overplus, by warrant under the hand and seal of one or more justices, before whom he or they shall be so convicted: Which penalties by this Act appointed to be levied, shall by the said justice or justices be distributed, one half to the poor of the parish where such offence was committed, and the other half to the informer or prosecutor.

How to be disposed of.

(1) In R. v. Major, 4 T. R. 750, a conviction was sustained for buying by a customary measure, different from that of the statute.— Per Lord Kenyon*—*4 These acts are expressed in the most positive terms, and it was admitted that there was no subsequent law which directly repealed them. But several other statutes were referred to, directing returns of the average price of com, and noticing in these returns a customary measure. These, rt was argued, obliquely, though not directly, repealed the statutes of Charles II. We have considered the matter very fully, and are of opinion* that the argument does

not lead to that conclusion. We cannot get rid of those positive laws by a reference to subsequent statutes, which were passed for another purpose, and which leave the former ones still in force/ ’

(2) The buyer is liable to the penalty of 40*», imposed by 22 Ch. II. c. 8. as well as to the forfeiture of the corn, or the value. The conviction may conclude against the statute in the singular number, the whole penalty being imposed on the buyer by this Act. An objection as to not setting out the quantity with sufficient certainty overruled; R. v« Arnold, 5 T. R. 353.

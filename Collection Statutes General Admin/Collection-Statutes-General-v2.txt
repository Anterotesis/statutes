Letters Patents to use new Manufactures saved.

(1.) A Patent was held void for an invention by which more Caps and Bonnats could be thickened by a fulling mill in one day than by the labour of fourteen men who got their livings by it, on the ground of its being inconvenient to turn so many labouring men to idleness—3 Inst. 184. This mode of contemplating the effect of machinery to shorten labour is a fair specimen of the wisdom of our ancestors upon questions of political economy. A very different view of the subject had taken place at the time of the trial respecting .Arkwright’s patent (1785), when the inconvenience urged arose from the confining the benefit of an invention of such extensive consequence to a single individual. In the Metre facia* in that .case, one of the objections alleged against the patent was, that it was prejudicial and meonveaient to tho subjects in general, and issue was taken upon that allegation; but at the opening of the trial,

Buller, Justice, interposed, intimating his opinion that it was a mere consequential issue and a quae* tion of law upon which the prosecutors could not be permitted to give any evidence; and that if it waa necessary to stuck the patent upon those general words of the Act of Parliament, it ahould be suted in what respect it was so, and then the fact would be put in issue; snd after some discussion, it was agreed that the case should be tried on the other issues in which the patent was impeached on specific grounds.

(2») The general objects of this Act in aup-prening monopolies having been fully accomplished, the only questions which now arise respecting it are upon the effects of patents granted under this proviso. The patents are granted in an established and uniform form, except so far as relates to suting the particular subject of th* grant, and contain a proviso that if the peter' B3

should not particularly describe and ascertain the nature of hu invention, and in what manner the same is to be performed, by an instrument in writing to be inroiled in chancery within one month after the date, the grant shall be void. The instrument so required is called the Specification. The terms of the grant are usually very general and only express the object and purpose of the invention, the particular description of which is reserved for the Specification, which may be considered as incorporated in the patent. The points to be considered with reference to the law of patents may be divided into the following heads :— 1st. the Nature and Subject Matter of the Invention—2nd, the Originality—3rd, the Sufficiency of the Specification—4th, the Degree of Similarity, which amounts to an Infraction—5th, the Judicial Proceedings by which the Patent may be supported, (a) by Action at Law, (b) by Suit in Equity, or rescinded, vis. (c) by writ of idre facias.

I. Upon the first and most of the other points respecting the validity of patents the fullest information is to be derived from the cases respecting the patent granted to Mr. Watt, for an invention for lessening the consumption of steam and fuel In fire-engines. The Specification begins with Stating, " My Method of lessening the consump-" tion of Steam consists of the following Pain ciplbs and states the addition of some vessels called condensers with some rules for their construction and application. It was objected that a patent could not be granted merely for a method or principle; but that it must be for a formed and organised machine or instrument or manufacture. The Judges of the Common Pleas, in Bolton v. Bull, 2 H. BL 463. were equally divided as to the validity of this otyection, Heath and Buller, J. being in favour of the objection, and Rooke, J. and Eyre, C. J. in favour of the patent;

but in the subsequent case of Hornblower v. Bolton in error in the King’s Bench, 8 T. R. 95. the patent was supported by the unanimous opinion of all the judges. The difference of opinion which subsisted does not appear to relate so much to the "rules of law upon which the question ought to be .decided, as to the construction of the particular 'specification; the judges whose opinions were conformable to the patent considered the specification as merely indicating a general method or principle, the other judges conceiving those words connected with the subsequent description as sufficiently designating a specific invention. From these opinions 1 have thought it eligible to make the following extracts, with reference to the general nature of the subject. Rooke, J. A ft new invented method conveys to my under-ft standing the idea of a new mode of constructs tion; 1 think these words are tantamount to ft fire-engines of a newly-invented construction, ft It is objected that the patentee professes to set

" forth the principles only, but we are not bound " by what he professes to do but what he really " has done—it seems but reasonable that if he " sets forth his improvement intelligibly his spe-M cification should be supported, though he pro-" fesses only to set forth the principle. The " term principle is equivocal.'* The object of the patentee was "to condense [the steam u without cooling the cylinder—the means are u set forth."—44 As to the articles of the specifi-" cation which denote intention only, and do not u state the thing to which it is to be applied, I do not think he could maintain an action for u breach of these articles; for he cannot antici-" pate the protection before he is entitled to it u by practical accomplishment*"—Heath J. " The question is, inasmuch as this invention is to be " put in practice by means of machinery, whether M the patent ought not to have been for one " or more machines. If method and machinery had been used by the patentee as convertible M terms, and the same consequences would result " from both, it might be too strong to say, that " the inventor should lose his patent by the " misapplication of his term." The proviso in the statute is for new manufactures. Such manufactures are reducible to two classes, the first includes machinery, the second substances (such as medicines) formed by chemical and other processes where the vendible substance is the thing produced, and that which operates preserves no permanent form. In the first class the machine, and in the second the substance produced is the subject of the patent. I approve of the term manufacture io the statute, because it precludes all nice refinements; that which is the subject of a patent ought to be specified, and it ought to be " That which is vendible, otherwise it cannot be " a manufacture." "The patent must be for the " vendible matter, not for the principle.’* " The C(organisation of a machine may be the subject " of a patent, but principles cannot.*—Buller, J. " Upon the state*of the case, I cannot say there " is any thing substantially new in the manufac-u tore t and it was admitted, that there were no new particulars in the mechanism—that it was " not a machine or instrument which the plain-" tiffs had invented—that mechanism was not " pretended to be new in any of its parts—that " this engine does consist of all the same parts as M the old engine—and that the particular me-« chanism is not necessary to be considered." The very statement of what a principle is, proves it not to be a ground for a patent. It is the first ground and rule for arts and sciences, or in other words the elements and rudiments of them, a patent must be for some new production from those elements, and not for the elements themselves. " But it was said, that though an idea or " a principle alone would not support a patent.

yet an idea reduced into practice, or practical spp&caxkm of a principle, was a good foundation Cor a patent, and was the present case. The mere application or mode of using a thing was admitted not to be a sufficient ground, that if a man of science were to derise the means of mating a double use of what was known before, be could not have a patent for that; the method and mode of doing a thing are the same, and I dunk it impassible to support s patent for a method only, without having carried it into effect and produced some new substance. A principle reduced into practice can only mean a practice founded on principle, 'and that practice is the thing done or made, or in other words the manufacture which is invented/' u Mechanical and chemical discoveries all come within the description of manufactures, and it is no objection to either of them that the articles of which they are composed were known and were in use before, provided the compound article which is the subject of the invention waa new. But then the patent must be for the specific compound, and not for all the articles and ingredients of which it was made." — Eyre, C. J. " It was admitted in the argument! " that the word manufacture in the statute was of

* extensive signification; that it applied not only

* to things made but to the practice of making,

* to principles carried into practice in a new " manner, to new results of principles carried

* into practice. Under things made we may class, " in the first place, new compositiens of things,

* such as manufactures in the most ordinary ° sense at the word; secondly, all mechanical invenfions, whether made to produce new or old

* effects, for a new piece of mechanism is cer* tainly a thing made. Under the practice of m making, we may class all new artificial manners

* of operating with the hand or with instruments in common use; new processes in any art pro* during effects useful to the public, when the effect prodneed is some new substance or cora-m position of things, it should seem that the privilege of the sole making or working ought to be

* lor uadi new substance or composition, without " regard to the mechanism or process by which it has been produced, which, though perhaps also " will be only useful as producing the new

re." When the effect produced is no or composition of things, the patent can only be for the mechanism, if new mechanism is used; or for the process, if it be a new method of operating with or without old mechanism, by which the effect is produced. And this compendious analysis of new manufactures mentioned in the mute satisfies my doubt, whether any thing be the subject of a patent, but something capable of precise specification.

1 An improper use of the word principle set forth ia this specification has, I think, served to

* pusale the case. Undoubtedly there can be no " patent for a mere principle; but for a principle " so for embodied and connected with corporeal " substances as to be in a condition to act and to " produce effects in any art, trade, mystery, or u manual occupation, I think there may be a " patent; now this is, in my judgment, the thing

* for which the patent was granted. It ia not " that the patentee has conceived an abstract no* tion that the consumption of steam in fire-en-" gines may be lessened, but he has discovered a M practical manner of doing it, and for that prac--u tical manner of doing it he has taken out his u patent* It ia a patent not for a principle but m " process—it ia no abstract principle—it ia in iU M very statement clothed with practical applies-u tion—it points out what ia to be done. — Lord Kenyon, " The principal objection made to " this patent is, that it is a patent for a pbilo* sophical principle only, .neither organised nor " capable of being organized j and if the objection u was well founded in fact it would be decisive, . " bat 1 do not think it is to By comparing the *

* patent and the manufacture (qu. Specification)

" together, it evidently appears that the patentee* " claims t monopoly for sn engine or machine " composed of mechanical parts which are to " produce the effect described, and that the mode " of producing this is so described as to enable " mechanics to produce it.*'—Ashurst, J. expressed his opinion very generally in favour of the Patent Grose J. It seems to me that thin

is not a patent for a mere principle, but for the " working and making of a new manufacture M within the words and meaning of the statute."

M The specification describes the principles of the M method, and the method by which those prin-" ciples are to be carried into effect."—He also states a method by which the engine may be worked by the alternate expansion and contraction of the steam. This method, however, if not effected or accompanied by a manufacture, I should hardly consider as within the statute; butitseema to me that in this specification he does describe n new manufacture by which his principle is realised. The patent states the principles on which the inventor proceeds, and shews in his specification the manufacture by means of which those principles

are to take effect.-Lawrence, J. " If it wen neu cesaary to consider whether or not mere abstract u principles are the subject of a patent, I should w feel great difficulty in deciding that they are, " but that consideration is unnecessary upon the " present occasion; because, by looking at the patent and the recital in the Act of Parliament " for continuing it for a longer term, it appears " that Watt applied for and obtained a patent u for an engine or mechanical contrivance foe M lessening the consumption of steam."

Kitted in the specification—the statute reciting chat the King had granted the sole benefit of making and vending certain enginet, and that he had inrolled a description of the said engine. From this therefore it is clear that the Legislature understood that the patent was for an engine for some mechanical contrivance. Engine and method mean the same thing, and may be the subject of a patent. M Method/’ property speaking, is only placing several things and performing several operations in the most convenient order; but it may signify a contrivance or device, so may an en-gnie, and therefore I think it may answer the word Method." So " Principle* may mean a mere elementary truth, but it may also mean constituent parts, and in effect the specification is this, M the contrivance by which 1 lessen the con-" sumption of steam consists in the following c< principles, that is, constituent or elementary parts, a steam vessel, " &c. u That is the de-M scription of the thing when put into different *' language." In the above extracts I have purposely kept as much as possible out of view the precise circumstances and the qualities of the particular invention, with regard to which 1 should feel considerable difficulty in assenting to the conclusions that were finally drawn, conceiving that a better elucidation would be given to the general subject by shewing the grounds and principles upoi| which, in the opinion of the judges, the question as to the nature and character of the subject ought to be decided, than by mixing the discussion with an inquiry with respect to the justness of their particular applications. Two principles may, withxonfidence, be deduced from the case, viz. 1st, that the subject matter of the privilege must be a defined and specific contrivance; and, 2ndly, that the character of the invention is to be judged from a consideration of the nature of the invention as particularly de• It is to be regretted, that such arguments as this should he resorted to by a judge of the superior intellect which indisputably belonged to Sir Soulden Lawrence. The patent was granted for the ordinary term; an Act of Parliament was passed for the extension of it to a longer period, expressly saving all objections to the original patent; and from the whole tenor of the Act it is evident that nothing could be more distant from the intention of it, than by means of the incidental expressions used in denoting the subject of riie invention to decide or prejudice any question as to its nature, or to induce a different view of the case, in consequence of the provision for the extension of the term, from that which ought to have been taken if no such extension had been made and the case had rested upon its original merit *

scribed, and not by any verbal criticism upon the general terms which may be accidentally used in characterising it. The question respecting the validity of a patent, for an addition to a subject previously known, falls rather under the following head of discussion than the present.

II. As to the originality of the invention. In Edgebury v. Stephens, 2 Salk. 447. it was ruled that the first introducer of an invention practised beyond sea should be deemed the first inventor.—• A previous invention not brought into practice, does not impugn the claim to originality in the grantee of the patent. Therefore in the case on Dolland’s object glasses, cited by Buller, J. in Bolton v. Bull, 2 H. B. 487. the question was whether Dolland or Hall was the first and true inventor, within the meaning of the statute; Hall having first made the discovery in his closet, but never made it public, and on that ground Dolland’s patent was confirmed.

With respect to a variation in the form or manner of an invention formerly used, the following view taken by BuUer, J. of the evidence, as to one part of the machine that was the subject of Arkwright's trial, will not be immaterial—* They had that before which answered the same purpose, though not made exactly in the same form; if it was new it was of no use, but they say it was not new, for though it was not precisely in the same shape in substance, it was the same thing."

In a trial on the validity of Tennant's patent, for a bleaching liquor, a person stated tbit he had used the same preparation in bleaching for five or six yean, and had kept it a secret from all but hia partners, and two servants, concerned in preparing it. Another witness proved that he had suggested to the patentee that he would probably attain hia end, by a certain method, which Tennant afterwards told him had succeeded.—The plaintiff was nonsuited on this evidence, because be could not prove that the object of it was a new discovery, or that he himself was the sole inventor.—Collier on Patents, 117. The latter circumstance can hardly be supposed to have had much influence on the decision, for it would be contrary to all reason and authority, to contend that the mere suggestion of the probable success attending the adoption of a given method to obtain an object contemplated by the parry to whom the suggestion is made, snail deprive such party of the credit of originality, in an invention which he first carried into practical effect; and it would be almost impossible in the nature of things, for any invention to be deemed original, if it could be construed otherwise, by shewing that the inventor had been assisted by some accidental hints from those whom he had consulted in carrying on the process of hit discovery. Upon inquiry from the attorney con* cernedfor the plaintiff u the cause, I find that

under this head it will be proper to advert to the validity of a patent, for an addition to an invention previooriy existing. In 3 lost. 184. it is said, that auch a privilege as is not contrary to law, must be esrontiaKy and substantially newly invented; bur if die substance was m east before, and a new addition thereunto, though that addition make the former more profitable, yet it is not s new manufacture in law, and so it was resolved, in rile Exchequer chamber, 15 Elis, in Bircot’a case, for a privilege, concerning the preparing and inciting of lead ore; for there it was aid, that that was bot to put a new button to an old coat, and it is much easier to add than invent.—In Belton «• Boll, Boiler, J, obeerred, u that it did not appear what were the particular facts of that cam, and there seemed to be more quamtnea than cottdky in the reason assigned. If the button were new, he did not fee! the weight of the objection, that the coat on which the .button was to be put, was old.*’—Mr. I. Buller also mentioned the earn of Morris r. Branson, before Lord Mansfield, in which a patent for an addition to the old stocking frame was supported, and said that since that time it had been the generally received opinion at Westminster HaU, that a patent for an addition is good, 2 H. B. 489.—* But then it must be fin the addition only, and not for the old machine too. in Jesaop’s case the patent was held to be void, beam it extended to the whole watch, and the invention was a particular movement only. Where a patent is taken for an improvement only, the public lure a right to purchase that improvement by itself, without being incumbered with ocher throgfc"--JIM.

One of the strong objections to Bolton and Watt’s patent was, that it extended to the whole nwchino, and not merely to the new invention, and the opinion of Boiler, J. was in favour of the objection; bot in the Court of King’s Bench the patent was held to extend only to the addition, and the court thought that the patent was only fur the additional improvement, 8 T.R. 95. Upon this as well as the preceding part of the case, it it net material to the exposition of the general prin* Quart, Whrriier a patent am be good if Obtained for a mere process to be carried on by known implant ant or elements acting upon known anhamneeo; inasmuch as the weed manufacture, " in 21 lac. 1. c. 3. teems rather to be confined either to sobm nfw article or to seme new itrunisnt, to he need in making an article pre-vseoriy well known ?

cipie to examine the accuracy of the opfarioti, which-finally prevailed in the particular instance.

In Turners. Winter, 11 E. Ifi9. note, the patent was-for ground lace, and the specification went generally to the inventioa of mating silk and cotton thread upon the frame. This had been done before, but ins leas convenient manner; bu*T Bailer, J. held, that as the patent claimed tlM' exclusive liberty of making lace, composed of rifle and cotton thread mixed, and not of any particular mode of mixing it, it was void.

There is no objection upon which petents mum frequently fail, or which it requires greater cantkm to avoid, than making the grant, as described in the specification, more extensive than the dfa-covery; and it is settled, that if the spedficatiuBt is objectionable on this ground, it defeats the entire patent, and not merely aomuch of it as relateU! to what is not newly invented. When the natuzw of the subject renders it neccmary in the description to blend the new discovery with a preceding subject, it is desirable, in order to avoid misapprehension, particularly and distinctly to declare whir part of the description is intended to be relief upon as constituting the discovery for wfeich dm exclusive privilege is claimed.—See Hannan Vm Playne, 11 East. 101. more particularly stated? infra. A patent was granted for an improvemeuC upon a machine, for which there was a auhaiathig patent, as not infringing upon the rights of that former patentee; but it was said, that if the improvements could not be used without the engiim for which the patent had been granted, they must wait for the expiration of that patents—Ex-pattn Fox. 1st V.and B. 67.

HI. With respect to the sufficiency of the specification, the general rules, which are ahrayn acted on, are dearly laid down in Tbraer e. Whiter, 1T. R. 603. where it was mid, per Arirorst, £ It is incumbent on the patentee to give a speri-ficatien of the invention, in the clearest and most unequivocal terms of which the subject is capable; and if it appears that there is any nimn rmiy ambiguity, affectedly introduced into the specifics-tion, or any thing which tends to mislead the public, in that case thepatent is void."—Kthe process as directed by the specification doer not produce dm which thepatent professes to do, the patent itself it void. It is certainly of consequence that the terms of a specification should express the invention in the deftest and mese explicit manner, so that a man of science my be aide to product the tiring intended without this necessity of trying experiments. Buller, h Whenever the patentee brings an action on hie patent, if the novelty or effect of the invention bn disputed, he must shew in what his invention consists, and that he produces the effect proposed by the patent, in the manner specified*—If he could nUke the matter described, with only two ox thrpf

of the ingredients specified* and he has inserted others which will not answer the purpose, that will avoid the potent. So if he make the article* for which the patent is granted* with cheaper materials than those which he has enumerated* although the latter will answer the purpose equally well* the patent is void; 'because he does not put the public in pomesnon of his invention* or enable them to derive the same benefit which he himself does." In the particular case* there were three objections* which were all held fatal:—1st* That in Older to produce the effect* you must go out of the patent; —2nd* That a subetance was mentioned in general terms* of which there were three species* one whereof only was applicable to the process in question3ra* That the patent professed to do three things, and that by feiling in one of them it was void. Buller* J. cited a case before Lord Mansfield* for infringing a patent for steel trusses* whence it appeared that the patentee, in tempering the steel, rubbed it with tallow* which was of some use in the operation* and because this was omitted* the specification was held to be insufficient* and the patent was avoided. This certainly was carrying the matter to the utmost possible degree of strictness* and rather beyond the fair claims of public convenience.—In the trial on Arkwright's patent, Buller, J. in his directions to the jury, expressed himself with respect to the specification as follows:—" It is clearly settled as " law, that a man, to entitle himself to the benefit M of a patent, must disclose his secret and specify

* his invention in such t way, that others may be *• taught by it to do the thing for which the patent a is panted* and it must put the public in pos-u session of the secret in as ample and beneficial u a way as the patentee himself had used, it $ and* •*' therefore, unless the discovery be true and fair *

* the patent is void. If the specification, in any " part of it* be materially false or defective, the " patent is against law and cannot be supported.

* It has been truly said, that if the specification be w such, that mechanical men of common under-" standing can comprehend it* to make a machine

* by it* it is sufficient j but then it must be such " that the mechanics may be able to make the machine, by following the directions of the spe* cification, without any new inventions* or ad" ditiofia of their own." In the same case, among various other objections, it appeared, that some things were specified as part of the invention, wbkh were no part of the engines actually used; with to Which, the learned judge observed—

«If thoM we of *6 *hro'r» »

* merely to puule, I hive no difficulty to tty, th»t,

* upon that ground alone* the patent it void; for m1 it is not that fair* full, true mscoveiy* which the public have a right to demand."—In Bolton v. Bull* 2 H. B. 463. the compliance with the rule of law vpoa tbit subject* q>pean to be vey accurately stated* by the finding in the special verdict, That the specification is of itself sufficient. " to enable a mechanic* acquainted with the fireengines previously in use* to construct fire-en-" gines producing the effect of lessening the con-M sumption of fire and steam, in fire-en^nes, upon. " the principle invented by the patentee."

In Hanner v. Playne* 11 East, 101. s patent had been granted for a machine* of which the specification was duly inrolled j and another patent was afterwards granted to the same person for improvements on the machine, the specification of which described the whole machine in its improved state without distinguishing the machine in its improved state* from the state and condition of it under the former petent; and the court of King's Bench certified to the Lard Chancellor in favour of the validity of the patent. Lmri Ellenborough said* upon this occasion, " Reference must often be made in these cases to matters of general science, as the party must carry a reasonable knowledge of the subject-matter with him* in-order dearly to comprehend specifications of this-nature* though fairly intended to be made."4

IV. There it no discussion in any of the aw thorities with regard to the degree of similarity to the invention* which is the subject of a patent *, which will amount to an infraction; but the true principles of decision, in this respect, seem to be comprised in the following extracts from the opinion of Rooke, J. in Bolton v. Bull, 2 H. B. 479. i " The mechanical improvement* and not the fans of the machine* is the object of the patent; and if this mechanical improvement is intelligibly specified, of which a jury must be the judges* we may*. I think; protect the patentee"—'* Infringement *, or not, is a question far the jury." .

V. With respect to the remedy for infraction^ of a petent, the most usual couise is by action at law. For the form of dedsration* V. 2 Chitty on Pleadings, 317.8 Went. 431. As to the evidence to be given in the first instance, Buller* I. in Turner v. Winter* 1 T. R. $02. already cited* said* " I hold that a plaintiff must give some evidence to shew what his invention was* unless the other ride admit that it has been tried and succeeds. Whenever the patentee brings an action on his patent* if the novelty or effect of the invention be disputed, he must shew in what his invention consists* and that he produced the effect proposed by the patent in the manner specified. Slight evidence of this on his part is sufficient, and it is then incumbent on the defendant to felrify the specification."

Another mode of redress against the infraction nf patents is by bill in equity for an injunction. Formerly an injunction was not granted, uf the validity of the patent was disputed, without a previous trial at law.—An. 1 Vem. 120. [The case related to the validity of a patent for the sale of bibles, and not to any patent founded upon the exception in the statute, 21 Jac* but I apprehend, that the principle would be the same.] Tottells v. University of Cambridge, 1 Vem. 275.; and the same was held by Lord Clare, as Chancellor of Ireland, in Grierson r. Jtckson, Irish T. R.304. Bat more modem cases have taken a different course. In Bolton v. Bull, 3 Vesey, 140. an injunction was obtained, that the question of the validity of the patent might be tried at law, and the judges of the Common Pleas having been equally divided in the case so often cited in the present note, the Lord Chancellor said, that he could not put the patentees upon the acceptance of terms, that, upon collateral reasons, they may think disadvantageous to the exercise of the right of which they ire in possession; neither can 1 put them out of poateanon, upon the difference of opinion of the court. I will not put them to compensation—1 will not disturb the possession of their specific right. It is of notoriety, that this fire-engine has been erected in many parts of the country with great advantage. And this doctrine was confirmed by Lord Eldon, in the case of the Uuiveniries of Oxford and Cambridge t*. Richardson, 6 Vesey, 62SI; and in Harmer v. Playne, 14 Vesey, 130. when his lordship said, " Viren the Chwo, on behalf of the public, grants letters patent, the grantee entering into a contract with the Crown, die benefit of which contract the public are to have, and the public have permitted a reasonably long and undisputed possession under colour of the patent, the court has thought, upon the fact of that possession proved against the public, that there is less inconvenience in granting the injunction until the legal question can be tried, than in dissolving it at the hazard that the grant of the Crown may in the result prove to hive been valid.* '

I cannot help feeling, that there is something vnatisfactory in the principles which have been just mentioned. The analogy between the actual and manifest possession of a corporeal subject, and the supposed possession of a patentee, is apparently a very fallacious one. In the first instance, there Is, from the nature of the subject, a right of powesaion and property somewhere, and the fair presumption is in favour of the actual specific posKsrion, which, in general, could not have been obtained against those having the right without an imwdwfo roristsncoj wherea* inch reject to

monopolies, the presumption is in favour of the general liberty of the community to apply theic talents and industry according to their own discretion, subject, under particular circumstances of a peculiar nature, to restraint, on behalf of favoured individuals—but that restraint is the exception, which, in the nature of the thing, requires to ho supported by full and absolute proof. The idea of a contract by the Crown in favour of the public appears rather of a fanciful nature. There in no absolute contract on the part of the grantee —no stipulation on his port, which he is under any positive obligation to perform, but a mere condition attached to the right conferred, and the subsistence of which condition is essential to the validity of the right. The Crown, in granting the right with the condition studied, assumes nothing as to the subsistence or non-subeisteiice of the condition, which is entirely matter of proof on the part of the grantee, and of proof in the nature of a condition precedent, at completely as if it had been expressed in terms, that in case the grantee should prove the requisites prescribed, he should be entitled to the benefit conferred—and in this view of the subject no material detriment can arise from the patent being admitted to peas upon the er parte represenution of the party applying for it as a matter of official routine, without any judicial contest with the parties interested in opposing it, and which contest could not, from the nature of the case, be carried on with any benefidal effect; he ukes the proof of the validity on himself, and there is no hann done—but if, in substance and effect, the mere grant itself carriea a presumption in favour of its validity, an injury is committed to the public, by the effectual operation of the grant during the period that a legal question on the right can be kept in suspense, and the cases in substance and effect confer that right for that period, however repugnant to the restrictions of the sutute. If the right of the patentee it infringed, he has a claim to redress by damages at law or an account in equity, upon establishing his right, although not so foil and adequate a remedy as by injunction; but if, by an unfounded grant of monopoly, the general rignti of the community are restrained during the period of inquiry, all redress or compensation to those whose general liberty is improperly restrained is, from foe nature of the thing, entirely out of the - question. The supposed possession against the public is the mere assertion by the party of a right, which right depends upon hu establishing, by positive proof, foe existence of facts, of which foe existence oc non-existence is, d priori, equally uncertain; and nothing can be more completely vague and indefinite than the additional requisite of* a reasonably

(3.) No subject ever excited greater discussion than the general question of literary property, as founded upon the principles of the Common Law, and Independently of the special protection afforded by this statute. Several injunctions had been granted by Courts of Equity upon the supposition of a perpetual copy-right belonging to authors or their assigns; but none of the touts, in which such injunctions were granted appear to have been brought to a final hearing.

The general question was argued upon a special verdict in the King's Bench, in the case of Tonson v. Collins, 1 BL Rep. 301. 321. by Mr. Wedderburn (afterwards Lord Loughborough) for the plaintiff, and Mr. Thurlow (afterwards Lord Thurlow) for the defendant; and upon the second argument by Mr. Blackstone (afterwards Sir Win. Blackstone) for the plaintiff, and Mr. Yates (afterwards Sir Joseph Yates) for the defendant, with respect to the copyright in the Spectator. The inclination of the court was in favour of the right, and they were prepared to give judgment accordingly; but having received information that, although the argument waa conducted bona fide by the counsel, it was a collusive proceeding between the parties for the purpose of obtaining a judgment which might be set up as a precedent against third persons, they refused to pronounce sny decision. The following is sn extract from the argument of Mr. Thurlow—44 It will be difficult to confine this merely to books, and not to extend ft to other inventions. . A learned author (Bishop War-burton) has endeavoured at it, and brangled it and made sad stuff of it—he attempts a distinction between the labours of the head and of the hand; but in some machines the labour of the head Is greeter then that of the hand. Sir Isaac Newton had no greeter property in his principal than Load Orrery had in his machine. IF the labour of the head gives the right, the property is just the same; and it is possible that the invention of the mouse-trap cost its author the same labour of the head that the orrery did its noble contriver; so that this ground of property depends entirely upon the difference of heads."

[3] The question was again brought before the court in the case of Millar tr. Taylor, 4 Bur. 2303. (with respect to Thomson's Seasons,) and occupies above a hundred pages of the volume, upon this occasion there was a difference of opinion in the court, being the first instance of it which had occurred since the appointment of Lord Mansfield, a period of between twelve and thirteen yean. Lord Mansfield, and Aston and Willes, J. were in favour of the right, and Sir Joseph Yates against it. The case may be recommended to perusal, as forming a peculiarly able specimen of judicial discussion; as containing an interesting historical view of the subject; and likewise as illustrating several very important principles of jurisprudence of general application.

Judgment was of course given for the plaintiff, according to the opinion of the majority of the judges; but s few yean afterwards the general question arose before the House of Lords, in the case of Donaldson and Beckett, when it waa finally determined that an author has no property in his copyright, otherwise than according to the terms of the statute. The majority of the judges were of opinion that there waa such a right at common law—seven being of that opinion, and four of the opposite opinion; but there was an equal majority of opinion that that right was restrained, impeached, or taken away by the statute. Lord Mansfield declined speaking. Lord Camden and the Lord Chancellor (Bathurst) were of opinion that there was not any right

Claw I.] Patettte, literary Property, Sfe.

Independently of the ttatute. The answers of the different judges, with their reasons ace briefly stated in the Gentleman*! Magana* far 1775. The opinion of Lord Chief Justice lie Grey is stated rather more at length than the others. This, with the

rch of Lord Camden, I inserted in the view which 1 published some time ago of decisions of Lord Mansfield, thinking, that from their merit, they were particularly entitled to attention; and 1 hoped to have given them a wider circulation amongst professional readers than they would otherwise have had, a hope which has in no degree been justified by the event.

[4] Notwithstanding the determination against the general quettionof a perpetual copyright, there are some subjects in respect of which such right is still supported, sa resulting from, the prerogative of the Crown. These are biblo, prayer-books, and ncatntes. A dianwaion of the nature and foundation of this right wul, I am aware, he rather matter of curiosity than one of which the result can be applicable to any practical purpose; but which, 1 apprehend, will certainly lead to the condumon, that each right could have had no legitimate origin upon any principles of the common law at present acknowledged. The preceding number of this class exhibits a view of the law, at the time of its poising, with respect to the great extent of the prerogative exercised by the Crown in the granting patents for monopoly. Upon the jeat fiction of that right, with rapect to ocher subjects, an exception was made of the case of printing, tt to which patents were left to be af the like force and effect as if <She Act had never been made; but it will not be contended that, by force of this reservation, the Crown baa now the prerogative of granting an unlimited and exclusive right with respect to any publication or kind of publication aclccted at pleasure. The power fonneriy assumed upon this subject was carried to a very extravagant length indeed. Sir Joseph Yates, in delivering his opinion in the case of Millar Taylor, observed, that u different patents, which had been cited from Ames’s Typo-gnptical Antiquities, were too gross to be mentioned, but they excluded all idea of proprietary right; " amongst them were patents for til maps and charts of England, vthe printing of music, all things printed on one side of a sheet of paper, or any part of a sheet, provided the other aide was white paper. He also traced the manner in which the subject was affected by the connection between the Star Chamber end the .Stationers’ Company, and noticed the effect of the licensing Acts. He observed, that all the patents were enormous stretches of the prerogative to raise a revenue, and to •ratify particular favourites, without the least regard to authors and new compositions. The rest of the authorities cited were founded on political views, to prevent, sa they declare, heretical and seditious publications; and the order of the Scar .Chamber, that all books should be enured in the register of the Stationers’ Comn, was to prevent improper publications. The innocence or delinquency of the, and not any private property in the authors, were the objects of inquiry. Speaking of the nature of prerogative copes, he said, " The right of the Crown to the ado end csdwive printing of whet is called prerogative copies, iafounded on reasons of religion or state. The only consequences to which they lead are of a national and public concern, respecting the awahlished religion or government of the kingdom, and hear no anolqgy to the cue of private autboo.—Lord Mansfield considered the wnbcence of prerogative copies as merely a modification of the general and common .right of literary property; and from the cases which had been derided in favour of thma partimlsr capias be inferred, as a necessary consequence, the exigence of the general right. In the course of bis judgment he discuned at length the petition fthet Crown copies wove founded solely on property, and said, that in Basket’s case, .(Bather «. the University of Cambridge, 1 BL 105. 2 Bur. 661. aa to the right of printing Acta of Parliament,) they bed no notion of the prerogative of the Crown onr the proas, or of any power to restrain k by exclusive privileges, or of any power Oe controul the subject matter upon which a man might write, or the manner in -which he might treat of it. They rested upon property from the King's right of (original publication. The copy of the Hebrew Bible, the Grade Testament, or the Beptuagint, doe» not belong to the King—it is common—but the Kngliah translation he .bought, and therefore it has been concluded to be his property. His power rows in property. His whole right rests on the foundation of property in the copy by ’the common law. What other ground can them be for the King's having a property in the Latin grammar, which is one of hisandentast copies, than that it was id at his expence ?—Whatever the common law says of property s case from analogy to the case of authors must hold conclusively in my i with respect to authors, —From the manner in which this very eminent

i treats the erne of prerogative copies, as identified with the general law of copyright, k would seem manifest that, after the latter had been negatived by the reariu-rion of the House of Lords, he must (if acting oontiatently) have hdd that the non-irrimruffB of the former vu u a arnwarj consequence involved in the deritien.

Patents, literary Property, , fyc. c. [Part III.

Lord Chief Justice De Grey, upon this part of the subject, said " What is common law now must have been so three hundred years ago when printing was invented: no traces of such a claim (speaking of literary property in general) are to be met with prior to the Restoration—very few cases of this kind happened in Charles the Second's time, or before the licensing Act, and those few were determined upon the prerogative right of the Crown. The executive power of the Crown drew alter it this prerogative right, which extended to all Acts of Parliament, matters of religion, and also of state. The case of Basket and the University of Cambridge, which was a late case of the kind, appeared upon the pleadings to be a question arising between two parties who claimed under concurrent and inconsistent grams of the Crown. My late honourable and learned friend, Mr. York, who argued that case, endeavoured to shew that his client’s right might arise from the power of the Crown; and, to illustrate his argument, said it might perhaps be property founded in prerogative; a language, however allowable for counsel, not admissible by or intelligible to a judge.’* The following are Lord Camden’s observations, in alluding to that part of the argument for the general right which was founded upon the existence of prerogative copies:—" 1 come now to consider on what foundation stand the prerogative copies, and these were in fact cases between co-patentecs, (for I must consider the Stationers’ Company itself as a patentee of the Crown,) and no authorship right occurs here. The right in the Crown is supposed to proceed either from purchase or contract, and our Taw argues from principles, cases, and analogy; but not a word of this in the judgment of the Court, but the arguments of counsel are adduced to prove the point. The argument of counsel is a sorry kind of evidence Indeed; in most cases it would be dangerous to rely on it, but here it is such stuiF as I am ashamed to mention. You have them at length in Carter’s Reports. First, it is put on the topic of prerogative, then of ownership—1 Henry VI. brought ever the printers and their presses; ergo, say the counsel, he has an absolute'right to the whole art, and all that it can produce. 2nd. Printing belongs to nobody, and what belongs to nobody is of course the King’s. 3d. The King pays his judges; ergo, he purchases that right for a valuable consideration. 4th. He paid for the translation of the Bible, therefor* forsooth he bought a right to sell Bibles. Away with such trilling.

[5] Such were the views which were taken upon this part of the subject on discussing the important general question of literary property; and it seems almost impossible to doubt that if, recently after the final decision of that question, and before the modern invention of Acts of Parliament lost by time or accident, the bull had been fairly been taken by the horns, and the question of prerogative copies boldly and openly met, the great men whose opinions have been cited would have held, that there was no foundation of legal right in such a claim. It might be reasonably urged, that any part of the law not founded on immemorial usage, or deduced from the general nature of the subject, could only proceed from legislative authority, and that the assumption of any such right was wholly without the province of either of the executive or judicial powers—no right, as founded upon the nature of the thing, could be applied to the case of prerogative, which would not as fully have supported the exploded right of general literary property. But for a considerable time after the introduction of the art of printing, to have challenged a right which the advisers of the Crown had thought proper to assert, would not have beeh safe in an individual, much less would the giving countenance to such a challenge have been prudent in a judge. After the Revolution and Act of Settlement had placed upon their proper footing the rights of the subject and the independence of the judges, the prerogative which had been before assumed was acquiesced m with-tmt taking the trouble of questioning the legitimacy of its origin, or the soundness of its foundation. The rival claimants to the benefit of the supposed prerogative right were of course not very likely to urge an objection which would strike at the root of their own asserted property; but however unstable such property might have been, if it had been attacked in a proper manner, and at the proper time, and notwithstanding it is regarded as a maxim of the law, that Quod ab initio non vaUt tractu temporis non amvaUseit; I think it is very manifest that the question could not now be agitated with any prospect of success.

[$] The right to the exclusive printing of Almanacks continued to be insisted -upon by the Universities and Stationers’ Company, as matter of prerogative, after the final decision of the general question of literary property. The origin of this property is, in 1 Mod. 256. put upon the following curious reasons:—Property in Almanacks are said to be the King’s, 1st. because derelict; 2ndly, as prerogative copies, because they regulate the feasts of the church. Mr. Caman, a bookseller, had the spirit to resist this absurd and ridiculous claim, and obtained a decision of the Common Pleas in his favour upon a case sent from the Court of Exchequer u^on a bill for an injunction. Soen after the decision, Lord North (then Prime MiniClass I.] Patents, literary Property, Sfc.

«irtiad Chancellor of the University of Oxford), brought a Bill into Parliament for giving to the Stationers* Company and the Unhrerrities the right, the previous exist- . «nce of which had been judicially negatived, under the falhrcious title of a Bill to AEVEST the monopoly in these bodies.

Mr. Carnan was admitted to be heard by counsel against the bill; Mr. Erskine who bed then recently entered upon his splendid career of eloquence, was the counsel resorted to, and his address upon that occasion is the second in order of date in the valuable collection of his speeches lately printed, and is well entitled to attention, both from the justness of its reasoning and the manly constitutional freedom of iu principles.

(71 The prerogative right, with respect to Bibles and Prayer Books in favour of the universities and the Ring's Printer, is the subject to which 1 shall now more particularly refer, and which has been regarded in a very different manner by the late Lord Clare as Chancellor of Ireland and the Court of Chancery, followed by the decision of the House of Lords in England. Upon application for an Injunction from printing an edition of the Bible in numbers with prints and notes. Lord Clare asked if the validity of the Potent had ever been established at law, and said he did not know that the Crown had a right to grant a monopoly of that kind. In the course . of the discussion he made the following observations—" I can conceive that the King, at head of the Church, may say, that there shall be but one man who shall print Bibles and Books of Common Prayer for the use of churches and other particular purposes $ but I cannot conceive that the King has any prerogative to grant a monopoly as to Bibles for the instruction of mankind in the revealed religion, if he had, it would be in the power of the patentee to put what price he pleased. upon the book, and thus prevent the instruction of men in the Christian Religion.*' " If ever there was a time which called aloud for the dissemination of religious knowledge it ia this, and, therefore, I should with great reluctance decide in favour of such a monopoly as this, which must necessarily confine the circulation of the kook.* M As to very particular purposes, I have no doubt that the patentee has an exclusive right to print Bibles and Prayer Books; but, unless 1 am bound down very strictly, 1 will not determine upon motion that no man but the King's Trinter has a right to prim such works as these.' *

H In giving judgment, he said, that the esse, which had been mentioned, seemed to intimate that it never had been solemnly decided how far the prerogative extends to give a sole and exclusive right of printing Bibles. Many of the old cases upon the subject were determined upon the principle of the Licensing Actand the motion was refused.—Grierson v. Jackson, Ridgeway's Rep. 304.

[8] A very different view was taken of the subject, seven yean afterwards, in the esse of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge v, Richardson, 6 Vetey, 689; in which an Injunction against the King's Printer in Scotland, who had a patent for . the sale of Bibles, printing or setting them in England, was granted upon motion and before the hearing, upon the ground that possemion, under colour of title, was sufficient to injoin and to continue the Injunction till it was proved at law that it was only colour and not real title, a doctrine which I have adverted to in the note on the preceding number with respect to patents, and shall again have occasion to mention. Is the course of this case it appeared, that, in the year 1718, Sir Joseph JekyD, as Master of the Rolls, had granted an Injunction in a similar case, which was supported upon appeal before the Lord Chancellor; and also, that a decree of the Court of Sasrion had, in the year 1717, been reversed by the House of Lords in favour of the right of the King's primer in England, confining the right of the Scotch printer to Scotland. With respect to the precedent of the injunction, it is clear that there had been abundance of injunctions before upon private copyright, until tho claim was finally put an end to by the decree of the Lords; and questions between rival patentees are not the moat probable method of bringing into fair discussion tho ganersl rights of the subject to resist the claim of prerogative, root and branch. The Lord Chancellor, in nts judgment, said, M My opinion is, that the public interest may be looked to upon a subject, the communication of which to the public, in on authentic shape of a matter of right, is also a matter of duty in the Crown, which are commensurate. It is not accurate to say, these privileges are not granted foe the sake of unlimited sale, and for the sale of the Universities, Ac. c. They are* to a certain degree, like all other offices, calculated for that sort of advantage which will secure to the public the due execution of the duty; upon this principle proceed all the branches of our constitution, (which does not adopt the wild theories that require the execution of a duty without a due compensation,) that the duty ia well secured in one way by giving a responsibility, in point of means, to the person to execute it. The reasoning which affects to depreciate monopoly will perhaps tend to create it.' There certainly is no great risque that false copies of the Bible Vol. II. C

would (et into general circulation by an unlimited right of printing them. We do not find it materially the cue in other works; and there are, 1 conceive, very few petaons indeed who would admit that the beneficial circulation of any commomty'in general, or of these writings in particular, can be promoted b j means of an exclusive monopoly; and the principal object, both of the right and the duty, with respect to the particular subject, appears to be the benefit arising to the privileged individuals.

[9] The question was afterwards brought before the Mouse of Lords, and the hi* junction against the Scotish printer confirmed. 1 observed, in the account of the proceedings which appeared at the time in the public prints, that one part of the argument of the counsel for the defendant was proceeding to question the general right of the plaintiffs, which was stopped by an intimation that the case of their clients did not consist in disputing the right at the plaintiffs, but in asserting a peculiar right consistent with it in themselves. This hint would of course have its doe effect in silencing the counsel upon s topic in which, if they had been successful, they would have cut their own clients* throats. And thus, I apprehend, that the law upon the question will be held to have been finally settled against the common liberty of the subject by this decree between the rival printers deriving their title from the very questionable prerogative of the Crown.

The exclusive right of priming Acts of Parliament and other matters of State has been looked upon more favourably than the other branches of the prerogative in question. Lord Clare, in the case of Grierson o. Jackson, said, he could very well conceive that the King should have a power to grant a patent to print the Statute Books, because it was necessary that there should be a responsibility for correct printing, and because the copy can only be had from the Rolls of Parliament, which are within the authority of the Crown; and Mr. Erskine, in his speech alreedy alluded to, admits the right in the strongest terms. Notwithstanding the argument ad tvracundiam, which may be so strongly urged upon the subject, I am by m> means satisfied, that the legal right in this respect, considered with relation te its origin, rests upon any juster principles than the exploded rights respecting the Latin Grammar and Almanacks. Previous to the invention of printing, the usual course was to ‘send the Statutes to be proclaimed by the Sheriffs; then, as now, every subject was bound to have taken notice of the contents of them at his peril; and there is not the slightest trace of an authority for a restriction of the employment of making manuscript copies, which, to the lawyers and judges of that day, must have been essentially necessary, although, in case of any question ariring judicially with respect to the contents of a Statute, the original record, or some duly authenticated copy, would of course be resorted to; and I cannot discern any legal principle upon which a discovery, that had the effect of facilitating the multiplication of copies, could limit and restrain that common right of producing such Copies which previously existed. In fact this authority, originally claimed by tile Grown, had no particular relation to the benefit of affording to the public a more accurate information upon the ordinances of Parliament, than could otherwise have been obtained, but was merely one amongst many other instances of the application of that general overwhelming system of monopoly, which is now reduced to very circumscribed limits, and supported only upon grounds and principles that in former tknes were never thought of.

[10] Although there is no reason to complain of the individuals in which the exclusive right is now vested, I think it evident that an exclusive right of promulgating statutes is in its nature much more calculated to retard than to promote a general diffusion of the knowledge of the laws, as there is no other tie than that of mere ptudence against the publishing those Acts, which are of general utility, in conjunction only with many others that would be totally useless, and of including in tiro collection every turnpike and canal Act that has been ever pasrod. The magnitude of the collection, which is actually published, is a very serious object in respect of expence to a person newly entering on the practice of the profession, and to gentlemen acting in the commission of the peace, and the great disproportion in modem legislation between the total bulk or the Statutes and the number of those which have relation to the general knowledge tnd practice of the law is felt by the pro. fesaion, and not unfirequently complained of from the Bench as s serious inconvenience. In the attempt which is made in the present work to remedy that inconvenience, 1 had originally conceived that the selection and arrangement, which are the principal features of the work, might have been deemed sufficient to protect the attempt from the imputation of invading the right, which it would be unavailing to dispute; and to that selection and arrangement the plan of the work was originally

confined; but, upon further consideration, 1 did not feel bold enough to enaftmter dte risque with which such an attempt would have been attended, and being strongly Impressed with the conviction that the undertaking, if fairly executed, would be productive of considerable utility$ I have devoted much time aod attention to- the formation of the numerous notes which now accompany it, and which 1 hope will have the effect, not only of supporting its legality, but of increasing its utility, although the preparation of them has very considerably retarded ks appearance.

If any apology should be thought necessary for the lenfph of a discussion which will probably be considered immaterial, as affecting its immediate objects, and as applying the test of argument to a question which may be probably concluded, by authority, that apology will, I hope, be found in the importance of tome of the principles with which the discussion is connected, and a steady attention to which, in respect of questions still within the reach of argument, la essentially conducive to the preservation of some of the highest excellencies m the law and constitution of the 'country.

[11] It seems to have been agreed, that the privileged copies may be printed by others than those having the patent right, if accompanied by bond fids notes. In the case of Baskett v. Cunningham, 1 BL Rep. 370. the defendant, in conjunction with several booksellers, was publishing, in weekly numbers, a Digest of the Statute Law, methodised under alphabetical heads, with large notes from Lord Coke and ocher writers on the law. He had contracted wkh Strahan and 'Woodfall, the proprietors of the patent for printing law books, to print this work, and k was printed at their press. Baskett, the King's printer, (whose patent extended to all statutes,) filed a Dili for an injunction. It was urged, that the' book was not within the meaning of the letters patent, being a work ef labour and industry, and the method entirely new; and the Lord Chancellor was of opinion, that the work's* entirely within the patent of the King's printer, and that the notes were merely collusive. But he would not interfere between the two contending patents, in the summary method of Injunction, but left them to adjust their respective rights in the course of law. He therefore ordered an injunction to issue to restrain the proprietors from printing at any other than a patent proas, which, as Woodfall and Strahan were secretly in league wkh Baskett, and were at that time jointly concerned in a new edition of the Statutes, eras equivalent to a total injunction, the law printers finding means to elude their contract wkh Cunningham.

In what respect the notes in that case were collusive does not appear; but, according to the present state of the law, a general patent for printing law books would be only laughed at. There seems to be very little reason to suppose, that a digest of the substance and effect of the statute law would be considered, by any tribunal, as rile subject of a legal monopoly. Mr. Reeves, one of the royal patentees, and the writer of several learned juridical publications, in the Preface to his edition of the Bible, (divided into sections,) observes, that all the authorised bibles published by the Kind's primer and the Universities are wholly wkhout explanatory notes. These privileged persons have confined themselves to priming the bare text, in which they have an exclusive right, forbearing to publish it with notes, which k is deemed may be done'by any of the King's subjects as well as themselves. He subjoins to this passage a note in the following termsM I mean such notes as are bond fids intended for annotations, not the pretence of notes which I have seen in some edition* of the Bible and Common Prayer book, placed there merely as a cover to the piracy df printing upon the patentees, as if fraud could make legal any thing that was in itself illegal. In some of these editions the notes are placed purposely to be cut off by the binder.9 '

The admisricn of Mr. Reeves, conridpring his legal knowledge, has interest in the subject, and the turn of his political opinions on the subject of prerogative, seem sufficient authority for the general right of the subject, with respect to the publication of the privileged copies having the accompaniment of bond fids notes.

The writers of legal publications on any detached subject, as the Bankrupt Lews^ the Poor Laws, the Game Laws, have never been molested since the time of the great discussion upon the subject of Copy wright, in priming at large the statute* applicable to those respective subjects.

8 Apne, c. 19.

[12] " Seon after the Restoration, an Act of Parliament having prohibited the priming of law books without the licence of the Lord Chancellor, the two chief justices, and the chief baron, it became the practice to prefix such a licence to all Reports published after that period, in which k was nsusl for the rest of the judges to eoncur, and to add to the imprimatur a testimonial of the great judgment and learning of the author. The Act was renewed from time to time, but finally expired in the reign of King William. But the same form of licence and testimonial continue *

Patents, literary Property, %c. [Part III.

In uae until not many yean ago, when, at the one had become unnecessary, and the other only a general commendation of the writer, and no toucher for the merit of the work, the judges (1 believe) came to a resolution not to grant them any looger, and accordingly the more recent Reports have appeared without them."—Preface to Douglas’ Reports. Sir James Burrow offers an apology tor publishing his Reports without an imprimatur, and says he knows it is a cootempt of that Court to publish their proceedings, and that it is against a standing order of the House of Lords to publish proceedings there, upon appeals or writs of error. He also adverts to the origin and continuance of the imprimatur, in the same manner as it is stated by Mr. Douglas—and adds, that he has been assured that some, who were possessed of judicial offices, had declared that they would never sign one, because it hangs out folse colours.

The idea of such publication being a contempt of Court would probably give somo assistance to the unfounded claim of a patent right for the exclusive printing of law books, since as long as such patents were granted, and the validity of them not contradicted by any judicial determination, the necessity of the licence might come in aid of the monopoly. I have met with an instance, which 1 cannot particularly refer to, of one of the Courts disapproving the citation of a case from modern Reports, not on the ground of their inaccuracy, but because they had been published without the authority of the judges. The prohibition by the House of Lords to publish the Reports of their decisions^(at the same time taking no care to furnish any authentic information upon the subject themselves,) seems founded upon very extraordinary policy, as keeping the public in ignorance of those adjudications by which they are most peculiarly bound; but this ground of contempt has long ceased to be the object of their animadversion, and Brown’s Parliamentary Cases, with the recent Reports of Mr. Dow, are suffered to pass as unmolested as the diurnal accounts of the debates in Parliament. Indeed, I apprehend that the general monopoly of such publications would not be of sufficient pecuniary value to form a very probable subject of litigation; and the practical application of the doctrine of contempt has been much relaxed since about the commencement of the present reign, when the mention, in print, of the name of a peer, upon any accidental subject, (for instance, that of his fish ponds had been robbed, which I have heard stated, as a case that appears in print, to have really occurred,) was taken up as a contempt of the House. The ridiculous extent to which this practice was carried by the late Lord Marchmant, was probably the reason of its foiling into disuse.

[IS] But a remnant of this practice still prevails, where the temporary interest of the subject matter would lead to a competition of publication, and a monopoly may be attended with some advantage; the case of trial by impeachment or mherwise, before the House of Lords: and the right of exclusive publication in the person printing under the authority of the House, has been supported to a certain extent, as one not having merely the summary protection of that assembly as a subject of cootempt, * but as giving a property entitled to protection in the ordinary course of law. Lord Bathurst having, in a case of Bathurst v. Kearsley, granted an injunction in favour of fhe printer under his authority of the trial of the Duchess of Kingston; LordErskine, upon the precedent of that decision, ordered an injunction until the hearing, in the pare of Gurney v. Longman, 13 Vesey, 493. with respect to the trial of Lord Melville, at the same time intimating that, unless he had a strong impression that at the hearing he should continue of the same opinion, and should grant a perpetual injunction, he would not grant an injunction then: but on the day of bis quitting /office as Lord Chancellor, he desired that it should be understood that he had not delivered any judgment further than by granting the injunction until the hearing upon the precedent of the former case of Bathurst v, Kearsley, and should therefore consider the question as open in any future' stage. A demurrer was afterwards put in, but was never argued, a compromise taking place. The argument of counsel, upon this case throws a considerable light upon the general subject. The counsel for the defendant admit that right of monopoly in prerogative copies, with respect to which I have manifested so strong an impression as militating against some important legal principles, but this admission, which did not immediately affect the interest of their client, leaves the general argument upon the subject to stand on its original merits.

[14] The Court of Chancery also exercises an authority with respect to restraining the publication from manuscripts of persons deceased. In the case of the Duke of QLueensbury v. Shebbeare, before Lord Hardwicke, as cited by Willes, J. in Millar v, Taylor, 4 Burr. 2330. an injunction was granted against printing the Second Part of Lord Clarendon’s History. Lord Clarendon, they say, let Mr. Francis Qwyuo have a copy. His son and representative insisted that hr had a right to print

Class I.] Patent *, Literary Property, tfc.

and publiah. The Court were of opinion, tint Mr. Francis Gwynn might make every use of it, except the profit of multiplying in print. It was to be presumed (as Willes, J. observes) that Lord Clarendon never intended that when he gave him the copy. The injunction was acquiesced under, and Dr. Shebbeare recovered, before Lord Mamfield, a large sum against Mr. Gwynn, for representing (list he had a right to print. Mr. Justice Willes adduces tins case, as an argument for the general right of fiterary property, in which he is followed by Lord Mansfield, who observes, that Mr. Gwynn was entitled undoubtedly to the paper of the transcript of Lord Clarendon*! History, which gave him the power, to print and publish it, after the fire at Petersham, which destroyed the original. But at the distance of near a hundred

Jean, the copy was adjudged the property of Lord Clarendon's representatives, and fr. Gwynn's printing and publishing it without their consent, was adjudged an injury to that property, for which in different shapes he paid very dear; and after mentioning the case of Pope and Curl respecting the publication of letters, which’will be presently referred to, Lord Mansfield puts a string of questions, tending to shew, that all the objections which had been urged against a general and unlimited ' copyright after publication, would equally apply to the case of an unpublished manuscript; as whether the right to prohibit the publication was real or personal, whether It was assignable, whether it could be taken in execution ? could it be vetted in the aangneea of bankrupts ? evidently intimating that the two cases stood upon an equal footing, and that if the one was negatived, there was no legal foundation for the other. In the review of the decisions of this eminent judge already alluded to, it occulted te me to observe, that a foil consideration of the consequences of those questions might perhaps lead to a different conclusion, with respect te unpublished manuscripts, from that which is the foundation of several derisions in Chancery. During the life of a writer the publication may be deemed a personal injury, but after his death several material questions may arise with respect to the chum of his representatives. It is taken for granted, in Millar and Taylor, that the injunctions were founded upon clear property. An executor can only bring an action on the rase for some damage, which reduces the assets, and to the extent of which assets he is accountable. But the right to prevent any person, having a manuscript of the deceased, from publishing it, is no property which can constitute part of the assets, in respect of which alone be represents the deceased. The same observation will, in some degree, apply to the heir. Besides which, this kind of property, is no wise ans^ logous to any hereditament recognised by the law. The interpositions appear to he on behalf of the family of the writer. But it seems a legal anomaly to take notice of the family of a deceased person, in any other manner than as connected with the property, which constitutes real or personal amets. If ever the question should come solemnly before a court, great respect would be due to the illustrious characters whose derisions were impeached j but if the object of the suit appeared upon examination to be destitute of legal principle and analogy, the authority of those derisions would probably give way. Lord Mansfield, to support the perpetual right to works published, argues, that an unpublished manuscript cannot be distinguished from them and may not that argument now be applied to the ultimate decision of the House of Leeds, against a perpetual common law right of publications, and extended to manuscripts?

I do not very well understand upon what principle the action could hsve been supported against Mr. Gwynn, unless he had expressly represented to Dr. Shebbeare, that he had an actual consent to publish the MS. for if the purchase was made generally, the seller could not be deemed to warrant the enjoyment of it in a particular manner, against the mere common course and operation of the law, as then understood and administered.

£15] The Court of Chancery interposed in the cases of Mr. Webb sod Mr. Forrester, cited Ambler, 695. the former of whom had his Prteadanta <f Comtayaaehg ' stolen out of his chambers and printed; and the latter had his notes copied by a clerk to the gentleman to whom he had lent the notes, and which were printed, and the parties were restrained by injunction from printing and pubfishing them. In Mackfin r. Richardson, Ambler, ib. the defendant had employed a short-hand writer to take down the Farce of Lam d Is Mad* upon its performance at the Theatre, and inserted one act in a Magstine, and gave notice that the second act would be published in the Magasiue of the following month. Upon an application to Lord Camden for an injunction, he directed the case to stand over until that of Millar and Taylor, which was then depending, should be determined; and, after the determination, the injunction was by the Lords Comuistionen, Smythe and Bathurst, made perpetual. Smythe, L. C. said, h has bsen argued to be a publication by befog acted, and therefore the printing is no injury to the plaintiff *, but that is a mistake for, betides the advantage of the performance, the author has another source of pro12 Nall. Ante, c. 19. Patent^ literary Property, $c. (Part IN. fit from tin printing and publishing, i«d there is as much rsasoo that ht should be protected in that right as any author, Bathurst—*c - The priming it before the author b doing him a great injury." It does not distinctly appear whether this decision was influenced by the opinion of the general right of literary property having been settled by the decinon in Millar and Taylor, or whether the restraining the publication of the farce, not then published by the author, was upon the ground of a distinct and independent equity, applicable only to publications not printed. In Coleman v. Wathen, 5 T. R. 245. it was determined that an action at law cannot be muntamed for representing on the etage the production of another person at net being a publishing within the statute. [16] In Pope v. Curl, 2 Atk. 341. Lord Hardwicke supported an injunction by Pone against the Defendant’s vending a book intitled Letters from Swift, Pope, amd ethers." His Lordship observed, that the first question was, whether letters were within the gnmnds end intention of the Statute, 8 Anne, and aaid, he thought it would be extremely mischievous to make a distinction between a book of letters which came out into the world, either by the permission of the writer or the receiver of them, end shy other learned work. The same objection would hold againat sermons which the author may never intend should be published, but are obtained from loose pepeta, and brought out after his death. Another objection has been made, that when k man writes a letter, it is in the nature of a gift to the receiver; •but 1 am of opinion that it is only a special property in the receiver, possibly the property in the pqper may belong to him, but this does not give a license to any person whatsoever to publish them to the world, for at mew the receiver has only a joint property with the writer." It is observable, that this case professes to proceed pertly upon the statute, which gives only right for fourteen years from the day of first pufotshing, and consequently has no relation to the case of unpublished letters; end supposing there to be a joint property in letters of correspondence between the sender end receiver, k does not seem by any means necessarily to follow that one of nerenl joint owners may not exercise the right of publication. Supposing different persons to be pomemed of manuscript copies of a given comparirion, in which no •ether haf a paramount dawn to restrain the publication, it cannot be auppoaed that any of them individually could prevent the publication by the others. [17] In Thompson o. Stanhope, Ambler, 737. it appears that the executors of Lord Chesterfield obtained an injunction till the hearing against the widow of Mr. Stanhope, with respect to thepublicstseti of his lordship’s letters to her husband, and of characters of different persons, the original* of which characters she bed delivered to Lord Chesterfield, who mid he meant to hum or destroy them, and, upon her offering to •give up the letters, declined taking or looking at them. Lord Apsley, according to the report, recommended k so the executors to permit the publication in case they saw no objection to the work upon reading it and having copies delivered to them. In flV.ftB. 21. k is said, that by the register’s book it does not appear that an injunction was actually granted. It is wet known that the publication did appear, but whether upon die judgment of the executors that they saw no objection to the Stork, or upon what Other ground we are not informed. In the late case of She Bari of Gramond ew Dunkin, 1 Ball and Beatie, 207. the executors of Lady lyrewley obtained an injunction in the first instance against the defendant publishing letters to Lady lyrewley from different correspondents, and which be had got poasesrion of by befog permitted to reside in her house, and continuing so do so after her death. The last case upon the subject is Lord and Lady Percival v. Phipps and Mitfotd, 2 V. and B. 19. The Bill stated, that Lady Percival had written toMitford several letters of a private nature, in confidence that he would not part with them, nor publish or permk them to be published, but that he had communicated them to Phipps, who had published one, and announced an intention to publish others, and played an injunction. Phipps by his answer stated, that he had published in a news-paper'certain intelligence as communicated to him by Lady Perceval for that purpose, and disavowed by her, and that the letters in question were written to Mit-ibrd upon similar subjects, materially tending to shew that the intelligence did come from Lady Perceval, and that aa she hod denied being privy to the former .publication, the character of Phipps and the value of his paper were in danger of foiling into discredit whh the public. The vice-chancellor dissolved the injunction leaving file plaintiffs to dowhat they could st lew. In the view which he took of the eubjOct he observed, that this equity stands not upon breach of-confidence or die injury to the footings of the parries, but upon this bread bask, dm invasion of-literary property. The following pasnge from the judgment is very material "This is the uakedeme of a foil, certainly, to^prevent the publication of prime *

The C. |9« interposition of the Court in this instance certainly is not a consequence from the cases that were cited j upon which 1 shall merely observe, that, though the form of familiar letters might not prevent their approaching the character of literary work, every private letter, upon any subject, to any person, is not to be described as a literary work, to be protected upon the principle of copy-right. The ordinary use of correspondence by letters is to carry on the intercourse of life between persons at a distance from each other, in the prosecution of commercial or ether business £ which it would be very extraordinary to describe as a literary work, in which th# writera have a copyright. Another class is the correspondence between friends of relations upon their private concerns; and it is not necessary here to determine, how far such letters falling into the hands of executors, assignees of bankrupts, die. could be made public in a way that must frequently be yerv injurious to the feelings t£ individuals, 1 do not mean to say, that would afford a ground for a court of equity to interpose to prevent a breach of that sort of confidence, independent of contract and property."

[18] A case was mentioned as haring recently occurred of an injunction seetesuir iog the publication of letters from an old lady under the influence of a weak attachment to a youai man. The case had been heard privately before the Lee#

Chancellor: but the defendant in that case, as stated by the Vice-Chancellor in hip judgment, bad received a sum of money not to publish the letters, and the attempt to publish them was therefore a violation of contract.

With respect to these private hearings it has lately been declared, in allusion If some commentaries in the public prints, that they never take place hut at the ee-ouest of both parties. 1 am very far from being clear that this circumstance render? them entirely unobjectionable, because it is of great importance that decisions which, m matter of precedent, are to give the law to the country atfage, should be pro-nauktted in such a manner that they may be generally known and acted upon, and mot kept up as a kind of pocket-pistol law, ready to be let off as may happen to suit the purposes of the few individuals who, from the accidental connection with a particular case, may happen to get possession of it.

[19] In Hogg v, Kirby, 8 Vesey, 215. an injunction was granted against the defendant from publishing a number of a Magazine, which was so printed as to appeap a continuation of a work published by the plaintiff, and from selung, dec. any other work or publication as or being a continuation of the plaintiff's work, or of the diilant's work, which had been published as such continuation. The case .was tly argued upon the ground of a breach of contract by the defendant, whe had n the original publisher of the work of the plaintiff; but the Court seemed to admit the general principle, that a person cannot publish a work professing to bis and banded out to the world as the continuation of a work published by another.

It was said, in argument, to have been determined, that property exists in.a newspaper, and that an action lies for publishing under the same tide.

[20] With respect to subjects more immediately depending upon the statute, god not referred to in the preceding pan of the note, it was decided in flach v, Longmaq,

Coop. 623. that the protection extends to musical compositions by force of thp worm books and othor writings, " It is not, " said Lord Mansfield, " confined tp language or letters—music is a science, it map be written, and the mode of arranging the ideas is by signs and marks, and the right may subsist as to a single sheet t$ musk.’’r-Clementi v. Goulding, 11 East. 244. and .cases there cited j and it setq? that the words of a song applied to an old tune, and published with it an a singjp sheet of paper, are privileged as a book—Hime t*. Dale, 2 Campb. 29. n. And ip fltorace «. .Longman, 2 Campb. 27. n. Lord Kenyon held, that the right of the author was not divested, by shewing that the song was written to be sung at the Open), and that all compositions so performed were the property of the house, not of thp composer; but, query, as to the accuracy of this opinion, as nothing is more usual than for an author to dispose of MS. and copyright, and a general usage and uo4*X-staiwfing upon the subject may be evidence of such a disposition.

[21] It is often a matter of consideration whether the work, represented as spt infraction of copy-right, is or is not substantially the same with that .for which dip property is claimed: where the subject will not admit of much variety, the orkjaql labour of one person will produce the same results with the original labour ofaS-other; but even in these cases, if the work is made out to be merely an adopting! .of

84 Patent#, Literary Property,

Upon this principle the property has been’protected in a road book, Canaan v. Bowks, 2 Bra Ch. 80—Cary v. Longman, 1 Ent. 358—Cary v. Faden, 5 Veaey, 24; —in Tables of Chronology, Trader v. Murray, 1 East. 303. n.; —in maps and charts (depending upon 8 Geo. II. c. 13 post), see 12 Veaey, 274an East India calendar, Mathewson r. Stockdale, 12 Veaey, 270—(in that case. Lord firddne, granting the injunction, said be had compared the books, and found that, in a long list of casualties, removals, and deaths, there was not the least variation, even as to the situation in the pages): so in the case of a court calendar, Lord Eldon, observing, that from the identity of the inaccuracies it was impossible to deny that the one was copied verbatim 8f literatim from the other—Longman v. Winchester, 16 Veaey, 269. In King v. Reed, 8 Veaey, 223. upon an application for an injunction with respect to tables of interest, the Lord Chancellor directed the plaintiff to bring an action. It falls within my own knowledge, that an action was brought, and the case was, at the trial, referred to arbitration, as to the question of the one work being a copy from the other.

In matters of this description, the fact of copying is made out as in Longman v. Winchester, by an identity of errors. 1 remember a Nisi Prius case in which the plaintiff was nonsuited, with respect to the tables of interest above alluded to, upon the ground that the errors of calculation pointed out as shewing the identity of the work destroyed, so far as they went, its utility; and that, therefore, for a work haring such imperfection, no copyright could be claimed: but this case was never brought before the Court, and was expressly disputed in the second action; and it certainly seems very difficult to conceive, that the property of a long and laborious

work should be defeated by a few accidental errors in particular calculations.

In Cary «• Kearsley, 4 Esp. 168. Lord Ellenborough is reported to.have held, that the identity of names in a typographical work was not sufficient to support a count lor printing and publishing the plaintiff’s work generally, but to have admitted that such evidence might support a count for transcribing particular parts.

[Query if it did not actually appear that the work was not wholly printed— liar if the general appearance was the same, a variety of instances in which •rots were transcribed might be evidence to satisfy the jury as to copying the whole.]

[22] It is settled in many of the cases, and is fully agreed, that an action is maintainable, not only in respect of the whole of a work, but in respect of the parts of it which have been printed and transcribed—and an action lies for printing the new additions and corrections of an old work.—Cary r. Longman, 1 East, 358-Mason v. Murray, cited ibid.

[23] It is agreed that a fair abridgement of a work is not protected by the statuter but that works colourably shortened are within the statute, and are an evasion ofiL— Gyles v. Wilcox, 2 Atk. 141. The same doctrines were stated as settled Law in-Bell v. Walker, 1 Bro. Ch. 451.

[24] In the before-mentioned case of Cary «. Kearaley, 4 Esp. 168. Lord Ellenborough said, that it is lawful to adopt the works of a cotemporary writer and incorporate them in a new work, provided this be done bona fide and not with a view to steal the original copyright; but in Roworth v. Wilkes, 1 Camb. 94. where 75 out of 118 pages of a work of the plaintiff, on Fencing, had been transcribed by the defendant into the Encyclopedia Londinensis, his Lordship held, that an action wan-maintainable, stating the question to be, whether the defendant’s publication would 'serve as a substitute for that of the plaintiff A review, he observed* would not in general serve as a substitute for the work reviewed, and even then, if it communicates the same knowledge with the original work, it is an undeniable violation of literary property. The intention to pirate is not necessary to support the action; it is enough that the publication complained of is in substance a copy whereby a work vested in another is prejudiced.

[25] In Sayre t>. Moore, 1 East. 161. n. which was an action upon 17 Geo. III. c. 57. (infray) for pirating charts, but was treated as depending upon the same principles as questions of copyright, it appeared in evidence, that the defendant had used lour charts published by the plaintiff, in making one large map, but that them were very important differences between them much in favour of the defendant’s, and the evidence shewed the plaintiff's charts*o be founded upoika wrong principle. In his charge to the jury, Lord Mansfield said, " in all these cases, " (speaking of cases of copyright,) the question of fact to come before the jury is whether the alteration be colourable or not ? there must be such a similitude as to make it probable and reasonable to suppose that one is a transcript of the other, and nothing more than a transcript. So in the case of different prints'; no doubt different men. may take engravinp from the same picture. The same principle holds with regard

Claw I.] Patents, Literary Property, tfc.

to charts; whoever has it in his intention to publish a chart may take advantage of all prior publications." You are told, that there are various and very material alterations. The chart of the plaintiff is upon a wrong principle, inapplicable to navigation. The defendant, therefore, has been correcting errors, and not servilely copying. If you think so, you will find for the defendant; if you think it is a mere servile imitation, and pirated from the other, you will find for the plaintiff" And In Mathewson v. Stockdale, 12 Vesey, 275. Lord Eldon said, tt I admit, that no man can monopolise such subjects as the English Channel, the Island of St. Domingo, or the events of the world; and every man may take what is useful from the oripnd work, improve, add, and give to the public the whole comprising the original work, with the additions and improvements, and in such a case there is no invasion of any right."

In Butterworth v, Robinson, 5 Vesey, 709. an injunction was granted in the first instance, upon a bill filed, to restrain the selling an abridgement of cases in the courts of law—it being stated, that the work was not a fur abridgement; and that, except in colouraMy leaving out some ports of the cases, such as the arguments of counsel, it was a verbatim copy of several of the reports of cases In the courts of law, and amoog them of the Term Reports, of which the plaintiff was proprietor, comprising not a few cases only, but all the cases published m that work—-the chronological order of the original work being changed to an alphabetical arrangement, under heads and titles, to give it the appearance of a new work. The Lord Chancellor arid, he had looked at one or two cases with which he was well acquainted, and it appeared to him an extremely illiberal publication. No very conclusive inference can be drawn from this ex parte opinion. The case was not brought before the Court again, and in fact, (whether by compromise or otherwise,) the publication went on, and is completed in five volumes, and is an abridgement of all the cases in-Courts of Law, from the beginning of the reign of Geo. 3d, to the condurion of the Term Reports. Such a work, selecting what is material from a large body of reports, and arranging the matter collected so as to render it more commodious for practical reference, whether the arrangement of the titles be alphabetical or systematic, appears to have very much die features of an original work. The motion, in the preceding case, does not reera to dispute the right of selecting bessages from books of reports, (including entire judgments,) in treatises upon particular subjects; and I cannot sen any material distinction between a liberty to extract all cases respecting bankruptcy, poor laws, insurance, and any other given number of subjects separately, and a liberty to publish a general work embracing the whole of the subjects which have come under legal discussion. In fact, if all works were suppressed, of which a con-riderable portion consisted of mere transcripts from books of reports, the law libraries would be very much thinned, and would be deprived of several works which are attended with considerable convenience and utility.—See Dodsley v. Kinnersley, Ambler, 403. in which Sir Thomas Clarke, M. R. refused an injunction for restraining the publishing an abstract of the Prince of Abyssinia in a Magasine. He observed, that no certain line can be drawn to distinguish a fair abridgement, and that •very case must depend upon its own circumstances—some stress was laid upon the plaintiff having himself published extracts in the Annual Register.

f26] In Cary v, Paden, 5 Vesey, (being one of the many cases which have been before the Court, respecting Cary's improved Road Book,) Lord Loughborough refused an injunction, seemingly on the ground that a great part of the plaintiff's work was e copy of the preceding work of Patterson, in which (as appears from the easel the copyright had not expired; but from the general tenor of the case, it is dear that a party has, in such cases, a copyright in his own additions, which has indeed been repeatedly decided, with regard to the identical work.

[27) In the before-mentioned case of Cary e. Keanley, 4 Esp. 168. it seems to have been the opinion of Lord Ellenborough, that the first publisher of a book, the copy of which he obtains by a breach of trust, may maintain an action against a stranger for printing it.

[28] In Walcot v. Walker, 7 Vesey 1. which depended upon an agreement between the parties, Lord Eldon, after referring to some opinion of Lord Chief'Justice Eyre not in print, said if the doctrine of the Chief Justice was right, and he thought it was, that publications might be of such a nature that the author could maintain no action at law, it wu not the business of that Court, even upon the submission in the answer, to decree either an injunction or an account of the profits of works of such a nature that the author could maintain no action at law, for the invasion of that which he calk his property, but which the policy of the law would not permit him to consider as his property. It was the duty of the Court to know, whether an action at law would lie or not, for if not, the Court ought not to give art

of the unhallowed profits of libellous publications. Declaring that at proPatents, Literary Property, tfc.

[PartlH,

No. IL sent, he «m in total ignorance of the nature of the work, and whether the plaintiff could hare a property in it or not; he would see the publications and determine 8 Anne, upon the nature of them, whether there was Question enough to send to law, as to

C. 19* the property in the copies; for if not, he would not act upon the submission in the

answer. Ir, upon inspection, the work appeared innocent, be would act upon that submission; if criminal, he would not act at all; and if doubtful be would avid that question to law.

It is observable that, in that case, there was no suggestion made to the Court, of any illegality in the contents of the work, and it does not distinctly appear, whether the Court took the matter up aa a general rule, that no relief shall be given in respect of any publication, until after a personal examination, as to whether the contents are libellous; or whether the interposition was on account of a previous impression respecting the ludicrous writings published under the fictitious name of Peter Pindar, and to which the particular question immediately related *

In Hime v. Dale, 2 Caxnpb. N. P. 27. n. it was contended, that on the principle stated in the last caw, there could be no copyright in the wdl known song of Ahmham Nevriand, because the lines,

" Though Justice, 'tis known.

Can see through a mill-stone.

She can’t we through Abraham Newland, " was a libel upon the administration of justice.

It might be supposed, that the argument was merely offered for the sake of a jest, but it seems to have received a serious answer win the Court, —Lord Ellen* borough saying, that if the composition appeared on the face of it to be a libel, so gross as to affect the public morals, he should edviw the jury to give no damage*; and his Lordship sod Mr. J. Lawrence both forcibly expressed the opinion that the aoog was not a libel. With respect to the question itself, it certainly does appear to be a correct principle, that a court of justice shall not give relief in favour of the publication of a libel any more than for any other breach of the law, but too much astuteness may be sometimes shewn, in giving the character of a libel to flying squibs, which are only calculated to rsiro a harmless laugh,

[29] In cases of an invasion of copyright, the remedy is either by action for the 'penalties upon the Statute, by action on the case for damages, or by injunction ip equity. Upon the two former no observations will be requisite, a abort examination or the latter will conclude the present note. It is dear that the proceeding by injunction is the most ready and effectual remedy which can be resorted to on the put of the plaintiff, but that a great degree of caution in the application of that proceeding, in the first instance, is requisite for preventing injustice to the de* fondant, whose loss does not from the nature of it admit of reparation, if the inr junction should, upon further investigation, be found to have been erroneously ap plied, and the judges of courts of equity have in many cases expremed a strong sense of the importance of this principle.

In Hill ». the University of Oxon, 1 Vern. 275. the Laid Keeper North re* fused an injunction in favour of the right of the King's printer, against the claim of the Universities to print Bibles for sale, until he had established his right at law; observing, that in caw the right should be found with the defendants, they would by ouch a prohibition receive a prejudice that he could not compensate nor make good to them; and Lord Clare, in the recent caw of Grierson v. Jackson, above referred to, followed the same course.

In the general discussion of the common law right of literary property, in Millar v. Taylor, 4 Bur. 2303. 1 Bl. Rep. 675. a great stress was laid upon the dtfierent injunction* which had been granted by courts of equity, in favour of such right*— Lord Mansfield (who had had very great experience in the Court of Chancery) said, that he looked at the injunctions which had been granted or continued before hearing, as equal to any final decree; for, that such injunction never is granted

r motion, unless the legal property of the plaintiff- is made out, nor continued answer, unless it remains dear. The Court of Chancery never grants injunctions in cases of this kind, when there is any doubt.—Sir Joseph Yates, on the contrary, in combating the general common law right, expressed his opinion, that the injunctions, bring temporary only, decided nothing at all.—Lord Cambden, in hie qpeech in Donaldson v, Beckett, plready referred to, expressed himself upon this part of the axgumeat as follows:—" All the injunction cases have been ably given; though I shall only add, in general terms, that they can prove nothing if a thousand •functions had been granted, unless the Chancellor at the live he granted them bad pronounced a solemn opinion, that they were grounded upon the common law, . Xord Hardwicks, after twenty years' experience, in the last caw of the kind that came before him, declared that the point had never yet been determined^-Lptf

Northmgtoa granted thorn on the idea of a doubtful title. I continued the practice on tile same foundation, so did the present Lord Chancellor. Where then it the Chancellor who has declared, ex cathedrA^ that he decided upon the common law right ? Let the decision be produced in direct terms.’ *

I am not aware of any other general opinions being expressed as to the degree of judgment which ought to be entertained in favour of the tight, in order to induce the granting or continuing an injunction previous to the hearing, prior to the case already cited of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge v. Richardson, 1 Yesey, 689. m which Lord Eldon, after tiring the observations of Lord Mamfield, and declaring that he could not accede to the proposition so unqualified, advened and a»> seated to the doctrine established in some recent caoes respecting patents, m which the Court of Chancery had injosncd the Defendants, during the pendency of the proceedings at law, upon the ground tint they had had pomeasion of the invention tinder cotour of the title a patent questionable in that degree gave them; and, upon the same matter coming before the House of Lords, in Bruce v* Brace, cited 13 Vesey, 505. he intimated the same opinion.—Lord Erskine quoting that opinion says, w Lord Eldon, when 1 pressed him with the cases that are now pressed upon me, to shew that injunctions proceeding upon legal right ought to have their foundation in a legal title, receiving consummation by a legal judgment, answers, that the Court granting the injunction until the hearing did not decide ultimately Between the parties.’* The opinion of Lord Eldon in favour of supporting, by injunction, the supposed posKsskm of patent inventions, accompanied by cokmr of light, is also expresssd and acted upon in Hevmir r. Playne, 14 Vesey, 130. which, with my haprestions respecting it, I have stated in the note to the

In-Hogg «. Kirby, 8 Vesey, 224. Lord Eldon, referring so the vis* taken of the tebject by Lord Mansfield in Millar and Taylor, says, that in these case which are very well expounded in that case, a Court of Equity takes upon kself to determine, at well as it can, the tight in this period, and with a conviction, that if then the cause was heating they would act upon the same rale. The Court takes upon itself, that which may involve it in mistake to determine the legal question. It is the decision of a judge sitting in equity, upon a legal question, and therefore not having all the authority of a derision of a court of law, but giving an •opinion, and pledged to maintain it, unless there should be occasion to alter it.

Lord Erskine, in Gurney v, Longman, 13 Vesey, 505. (respecting the publication of Lord Melville’s Triad), said, " I am so much convinced by the arguments far tile defendant as to the effect of an injunction, upon a publication of tint temporary - st, unless !

• Some of the Acts included in this class relate more particularly to matters of official regulation and to a peculiar branch of trade, than those which fid! within die general plan of the wotit—but are inserted on account of their importance, and the frequency of their becoming the subject of discussion. But it is not proposed to advert to the more minute regulations upon the subject, as affected by modern statutes, with respect to particular places or articles of tndffdt. A foP view of the nature and progress of the system connected with Statute Iff Charles II. commonly called the Navigation Act, down to the year 1792, is contained in Mr. Reere’t History or the Law of Shipping and Navigation.

(1.) It is stated in Reeve’s History of the Law

of Shipping and Navigation, p. 269, that it seems now to oe the prevailing opinion, that this statute is not repealed by subsequent Acts, however ab-: solute in their prohibition, and that it ought ter have its influence m construing cases of forfeiture^ but that Stat, 27 Ed. III. c. 19. (which provider generally that no merchant or other shall lose or forfeit ms goods or merchandise for the t a forfeiture of his servant, if not done by i commsnd or authority of bis master,) is not understood in the same fight. He adds, (what is proved by daily practice,) that Instances frequently occur where forfeitures arise from tile conduct i the clerk, hut to allow this as a plea would open a door to all sorts of fraud.

Again, where the party justifies the act upon die plea of distress, it must not be distress Which he luu created himself by putting on board an insufficient quantity of provisions for such a voyage, for the distress is only a part of the mechanism of the fraud, and cannot be set up as an excuse for it; and in the next place, the distress must be proved by the claimant in a clear and satisfactory manner."—See other parts in this case in note to Stat. 26 Geo.

£2.) In the case of the Recovery, 6 Robinson, 34o. Sir William Scott observes, that the Act is not limited by considerations of what territories belonged to Gnat Britain at the time of passing it, but applies prospectively to future acquisitions an well as to our more ancient possessions. Speaking of the East Indies he says, " It is well known that our establishments in that quarter of the world have stood on a very peculiar footing, which it has been perhaps the policy of this country not to define with great exactness. They may have assumed a different character at different rimes, and it may be very important in effect, and very proper in point of principle, that the general maxima of our navigation system should be applied to them in their present state, although there might have been e greater anomaly in practically applying them at a former period. With Regard to the first, he had always entertained the notion that they had not been hitherto so applied. But a case occurred not many years since, (Wilson v, Marryat, 8 T. R. 31.) which brought the consideration of the question in a distinct form before the courts of common law. After repeated arguments and much deliberation, the Court of King’s Bench expressed an opinion that the navigation laws did extend to those countries; and, in a writ of error, the judgment of the King’s Bench was affirmed, with a complete adoption of the doctrine laid down.—(1 B. & P. 432.) An Act of Parliament was afterwards passed, (37 Geo. III. c. 97. $ 22. and c. 117.) to quiet rile alarm which had been occasioned by this exposition of the law, and to recognize in general terms the policy of admitting foreign vessels to a "emulated trade on certain condhions, which the

East India Company was empowered to impose." The decision off the case of the recovery was, that the Prize Court cl the Admiralty would not virtually take cognisance of an infraction of the Navigation Act, which is only a municipal regu-. lation in persona not British subjects, although with respect to a Britiah subject, in whom the violation of the laws of his own country carries with it malum m se, it might be done.

The case of Wilson v, Marryat, mentioned in the above extract, did not turn immediately upon the question whether the British settlements in the East Indies were within the general operation of the Navigation Act; but it being taken for granted that they were so, the whole question in discussion related to the effect of a treaty allowing such trade to the subjects of the United Sates of America.

(3.) By 20 Geo. II. c. 45. prize ships, legally condemned, shall be considered as British-built ships.

(4.) By 13 Geo. If. c. 3. § 1—2. the King is entitled, in time of war, under certain regulations, to permit trading vessels to be manned with foreign seamen, not exceeding three fourths of the marines employed.

(5.) In Idle v. Vanneck, Bunt. 232. the Barons of the Exchequer held, that notice in the Register was not necessary to create a forfeiture upon this Act, though for a small matter they thought it hard that a ship should be condemned. In Grefoy v. Palmer, n. ibid. Reynolds, C. B. put the point on this distinction, whether goods so brought were part or not of the cargo; and therefore if mariners or passengers privately bring over a small parcel of goods, that is not to be looked upon as part of the cargo, aad it would be hard if the ship should be forfeited for that. In Mitchell v. Torup, Parker 227. Lord Chief Baron Parker gives an elaborate opinion, " That a forfeiture on Section 4, in respect of an importation of 22115. of tea, was not prevented from attaching by the finding of the jury, that they had been put on board without the knowledge, privity, or consent of the master, mate, or owners." He observed, " that the words of the Act in the first, second, third, and fourth sections were all equally negative, absolute, and prohibitory, they operate both on the goods and the ship, and there it not a syllable that hints at the privity or consent of the master, mate, or owners." u The Reason, " he added, " of penning the section in these strong

Mr. Reeves, (p. 181.) after stating different opinions which had been given upon the subject, says, u Upon the whole it is judged not to •be sufficient that the whole of the voyage is per* farmed in a British ship, hut it must be in the same ship, for if trans-shipping be allowed, it would be very difficult to prove whether the former voyage was performed in a legal way, and the provision might thus he easily evaded. However, where a ship has suffered such damage as to he unladen at some port, and the goods are put into another British vessel, the importation is always considered as a continuation of the first

voyage. But this is a case of necessity, and it must be proved before the importation is allowed.

Prevention of frauds.

VIII. And for the better prevention of frauds. Be it enacted, and it is hereby enacted, That from and after the five-and-twentieth day of March one thousand six hundred sixty and four every person or persons importing by land any goods or commodities whatsoever into any the said lands islands plantations colonies territories or places, shall deliver to the governor of such land island plantation colony territory or place or to such person or officer as shall be by him thereunto authorised and apin which there ia not a syllable to require that it shall be carried directly from Madeira to the British Colonies. If it had broke the continuity of the voyage, and had been landed in St. Eustatiua, still it would have been within the exception, the meaning of which is only that it shall be taken from Madeira as the terminus a quo, and go to the other places as the termini ad quos. If that is not to be considered as the construction of so strict an Act of Parliament, intended to operate as a qualification, 1 contend that there is a direct importation from Madeira. The commodity remains on board from Madeira to Jamaica; and there is too pretence that there was any landing, or intention to land it at St. Eustatiua—it was to be in the option of the consignees how much should be landed there—the remainder was to be taken as if originally destined for Jamaica, as much as if the ship had stopped at St. EOstatius fas any other purpose. There seems no occasion within the meaning of the Act that the ship should not touch at any intermediate place. It should come originally from Madeira, and this is the fair interpretation.

Dr. Lawrkncx*—1 shall slightly trace the history of these Acts. This is an Act which immediately followed the Navigation Act, and went upon the same grounds. The object was to secure to this country the carrying trade—that is laid down in the very remarkable preamble. It then lays down directions respecting the carriage of European goods—next follows the penalty of the goods and ship. As to what follows, it is provided to be lawful to lade (inter alia) at Madeira wine of the growth thereof in tuck ships so navigated.

It is only by the words, " in such ships so navigated, " that the former part operates upon this. It would be more fair to refer it to what is required by the General Navigation Act, and adopted in the preceding clause. That is not only the interpretation which an unlearned man vrould put upon it, but is the exposition of the legislature, in rile 22d and 33d Charles II. c. 26. made to supply some omissions, particularly an omission to repeal the word Ireland in one clause of the Navigation Act, and to require a bond to land in England. Sec. 10—The Act recurs to this preamble, recites at at length, and states, that it was therefore enacted that no goods or commodities of Europe should be carried into any the plantations but what should be laden and shipped in England, in English-built ships or ships made free, and navigated with English according to an Act of Parliament in that behalf. This Act, which is nearly cotemporary, is the best interpretation of the words to madgated. According to that interpretation, nothing requires a direct voyage from Ma-deiw.to Jamaica in the same manner as is required

with respect to European goods. The object was to prevent frauds, by other nations becoming the factors and merchants for the plantations, by taking European goods there. It was not necessary for that purpose to extend the provisions further. In point of practice, goods have been carried in this manner without interruption.

There was a period in which the legislature was anxious to prevent frauds in the commerce with the West Indies. Sec. 30—The 4th Geo. III. c. 15. is the next Act containing any clause similar to the preceding. A fraud had been practised in the mean time by taking in la%Ung at other European porta, and coming here for small parcel of goods, and then smuggling the goods from the rest of Europe. Therefore it is enacted, - that no vessel shall be cleared outwards for any plantation &c. unless the whole cargo shall be bona fide laden in this kingdom, with power for the officers of the customs to stop any British ships or veael* arriving from any part of Europe within two miles of any plantation, and to seise any goods for which the master shall not produce a cocket or clearance, certifying that the same were laden In Great Britain. Then comes an exception similar to that at present under consideration, and almost word for word the same, in which the word directly is not contained. This is an Act m pari materia. This is the first question of the kind that has been brought forward in the course of sr hundred and thirty years. In the case of the Columbus a question arose something similar. Soma Madeira had a permit to land at Tobago, but was not landed. It was contended, that because the master might have been compelled to land it, there was an actual importation and re-exportation. That case was stronger than the present, in which there was no permit to land. There were two other offences imputed in that case; but the Judge of the Admiralty Court held, that no forfeiture was incurred. The case being removed before the delegates was given up by the officers of the Crown under a protest, that there were points upon which they would not on future occasions hold themselves bound; but they did not state what those points were.

This is the first question which comes before the Court for regular decision; and the point hr, whether the commodity falls within the penalty for not carrying directly, and then whether it was not carried directly. Nothing in the clause attaches such penalty. The object of the douse does not require any thing of the kind. So navigated, the only words at all bearing upon it by other Acta in pari materia, mean navigated according to the Navigation Act.

It would be difficult to shew how the European goods should not be confiscated and the Madeira wine should. Is there any thing which fairly

Class II.] TYade, Navigation, Ship-Owners, Mariners and Fisheries. 61 *

pointed within four-and-twenty hours after such importation his and their No. IV. names and surnames, and a true inventory and particular of all such c goods and commodities: and no ship or vessel coming to any such land 10 island plantation colony territory or place shall lade or unlade any goods c* •* or commodities whatsoever until the master or commander of such ship or vessel shall first have made known to the governor of such land island Further proplantation colony territory or place, or such other person or officer as shall vided for by be'Jby him thereunto authorised and appointed, the arrival of the said ship or 7 & 8 W. 3. vessel with her name and the name and surname of her master or com- c. 22. tec. 5.

varies the one from the other ? The Court are called upon to say that a contingent intention to land at St. Eustatius is a positive intention without any act to carry it into execution; and to prevent the annual contingent supply of countries at amhy with Great Britain and impede the navigation of this country under an Act intended to promote it. There is nothing in this case to fix an importation and re-exportation; if there was it would be for the other side to shew it. On the contrary they admit the facts of the claim to be true.

Nothing was done at the custom-house. In foreign islands they may send in to inquire the state of the market and then send to the customhouse if they think proper. Here there was no act nor any thing more than a mere intention, which was to land what the consignees there required, which cannot be called a real importation any more than there was an importation of the dry goods, which is not pretended.

The consequences of a judgment of forfeiture would he to check a trade which has grown up since the time of the Act, which is highly advantageous to this country—employs much shipping. There is no public utility to promote or fraud to prevent by such a regulation; and the Court will rather assist than destroy the course of trade, if they can fairly and without violence to the Act.

As this question is brought on so long after the act, there is a fair ground to apply for costs. The vessel having been improperly detained, and dragged through all the Courts, the value of it is not so much as the costs incurred. If costs are not given, a number of small vessels will be seised an groundless pretences; and the owners will rather abandon their property than go to the qx-pence of decision after decision with great anxiety and delay.

Dr. Swabey.—The questions in this case axe very few. The ship was incontestibly navigated by British subjects according to the Navigation Act. The captain duly reported the dry goods and delivered his cocketa of them and a manifest of the wine., He clearly acted bond fide, and there is no ground to impute an intent to evade the law.

Neither the words of the Act nor any fair interpretation of it prohibit calling at intermediate ports with Madeira wine on hoard. The other ride must resort to s forced implication.

The 6th section contains a prohibition in certain cases. The next section gives a particular permission. The word directly does not form s part of that either as applicable to salt, Madeira, or any other commodity mentioned in it. The object

was to secure an importation in British ships, and nothing more. But if it were otherwise, nothing less than an actual landing would be a deviation from the Act.

The practice of the revenue is in our favour. There may have been opinions to the contrary, hut those do not constitute the law. The only case upon the subject is that of the Columbus, one of the grounds in which is decisive. The decision in the Court of Admiralty upon that case was affirmed in the delegates by consent - The only difference between the cases is, that in that a permit was obtained to land the whole, whereas in the present it was never designed to land mot? than the consignees in St. Euitatius should think fit. it was there said that Tobago made a mediae terminus and two voyages of what the legislature only intended that there should be one. But the print was overruled by the Court.

Courts of justice will be cautious against ex* tending penal laws by implication. It is eon* tended that they will not carry the law into execution, but they do not rit to repair defects.

The danse of forfeiture is expressly confined to the produce of Europe. Madeira wine is not such. If by construction the second clause re *, lated to the first there would be no forfeiture under the first, unless an African island is also to be taken as European by implication.

But if the word directly were in the last dauso this would be direct. There was no landing at St. Eustatius; and if an intention to laod is sufficient, there was no intention to land more than the consignees there should require. In the case of the Columbus there was an intention to take the chance of the market.

The case is not within the Act, or if it' were by constructive implication, that only goes to prevent the landing and not to subject to for* tenure.

If government had thought the question proper to he tried, it is odd that in the case of the Columbus they should give it up, as, if that had been decided, much expence might have been prevented.

That no European goods shall be imported but under certain regulations; amongst others, to be carried directly hence, and-from no other place; having not only affirmative but negative words. This is followed by a proviso that it should be lawful in such ships, so navigated, to ship salt, Madeira, and some other articles, and the same to transport and land.

It is submitted as a preliminary observation, that the word transport cannot be taken more largely

The object of the Act wae that foreigners should not share in the entile navigation Aon the original place of lading to the West Indies. To permit Madeira to be latched from ocher placet would be as much within the mischief as European goods must be ceased directly from England. We contend that itkaot intended to permit carrying in a different meaner in the second case from that which is required in the first. As the two parts ere hi pari materia, they mutt have the same construction.

[Mr. Justice Butter.—In the first it is expressly mentioned, but not in the other.]

Perhaps in the usual scale of geography, Madeira would not he placed in Europe. It is not attached twit, and may not be considered in that part of the globe. Bet for every purpose of revenue it has been uniformly considered as situated in Eu-sope; and He productions have been classed as shoes of Europe. It would be absurd to construe k otherwise. To say you shall not carry from Euxnpe, and then to except a place in Africa, would he eneeptm a nem^detcriptis.

The question comet to this:—Has there been a direct voyage from Madeira within the Act of Brntiameat?

In the plain and obvious meaning of the word dense *, a voyage ia only direct when there is an warltvi tiring comae from the iermimu a quo to the imuisiii ad qua *, except where the deviation is peodoeed by inevitable necessity.

If a ship bound for Lisbon were to go up the Baltic, that would not be called a direct voyage. This (it may be said) would be a considerable deviation—but if aberrations are allowed at all, what is there to limit or define them ? What extent of deviation changes the character from directnem to indirectness ? The only latitude in these cases should be the same as upon a policy of insurance —•to touch at certain places for the necessary purposes of the voyage. Touching at the Cape ef Good Hope is no deviation in a voyage to the Beat Indies—but to go up the Mediterranean would be a deviation in a voyage to America. Going to any port without necewity is a deviation, except such ports as are usually stopped at in the course of the voyage, and as to them the underwriters must take notice of the course of trade. The other ride is driven to contend that a voyage is direct, however circuitous, if there is no landing of the goods. According to such construction, Madeira wine, which had been taken to the East Indies, might be conridered as coming directly from England.

As to the intention end purpose of the Act, the

attention of the Court has been catted to the preamble. Two objects are stated in it:—The keeping op a correspondence with the plantations, and having the entire navigation. Will it answer the first purpose, if you call at every intermediate port ? Besides which, the great security that England should have the entire freight and navigation would be lost. If it is allowed to stop at any part, make as many regulations as you will, it wifi be impossible to discover where every particular parcel of goods was taken. Another object was, to supply the colonies with goods cheap, and a direct voyage will better promote that than one which is circuitous.

Much has been said about the practice of the custom-house—and it has been alleged that the custom-house at Lancaster permitted the dry goods to go the very voyage which is objected to The claim states, that the vessel sailed from Lancaster duly cleared for Jamaica with dry goods on board, part of which toes to be landed at Madeira, and part at St. Eustatius—but it does not appeal that that intention was notified to the customhouse.

- As to the practice of the revenue officers in the West Indies, I should be very sorry to appeal to them. The officers there lie at a great ffis-tmee from the seat of government, where the puke of authority beats weak. The officers five in smell communities, where corruption is most likely to prevail Government, on that account, lately thought it necessary to send fresh officers from Engknd; the Augaean stable has been cleansed, and I protest against any inference from former practices.

I contend the Act does not require an actual importation, in order to subject to forfeiture. Going to St. Eustatius breaks the continuity—but there wae an actual importation—and it would be a gross violation of language to say , that the wine was imported into Jamaica directly from Madeira. The primarydeatination of it wts to be sold at St-Eustatius. It eras carried there with a design to selL If that does not amount to an importation I do not know what does. The intention is end to have been conditional; —so it was as to the persons in Sc. Eustatiusj—but the intention of the.owners was absolute and complete. The wine was not intended to be carried further, if the consignees chose to accept it:—it was carried there for the express purpose of sale. When the practice ia relied on, has it been carried up to that extent ? That you may carry the goods to MTt with intent to sell them. Lax as the practice has been, it will not be contended to have been so large as that.

The case of the Columbus involved a great variety of questions. The crown officers thought that there were many circumstances in it, which entitled the party to an equitable and indulgent consideration. Tlwy therefore gave up the case, raecmag a right to oppose any legal point which was contained in its decision, if such should afterwards arise. A cat which passed without argument, and with a denial of its operation as a precedent, cannot operate aa such.

.Mr. Attorney General, (Sir John Scott.)— There are circumstances to be considered concerning the destination of the property and the Intent of the shippers, as well with respect to the goods from Lancutar as those from Madeira. This ii rapeemnted as the case of e vessel sailing . from Lancaster with goods, some of which were to be landed at Madeira, others in St. Eusutius, and the remainder in the West Indies. The, manner of stating the facts in the claim b, that it cleared for Jamaica with goods, pert of wbkh were intended to be landed'at Madeira, and other part at St. Eusutius. That bean in some degree on the question concerning the goods taken. So far aa I undMandthe Exchequer practice, there was nothing to prevent their being bnded at Jamaica —but if they were carried to Madeira or St. Euatafhia with intent to be landed there, and were not landed but carried to Jamaica, they would be .eebable. If there b an importattpn between the termini, it becomes a distinct voyage, and the goods me considered as shipped at the intermediate ports, although they were never taken out of the ship. If a ship goes to a-port in thb country with intent to land, it b a complete importation.* Is the law the same with respect to going into foreign ports ? It b considered ss an importation in our bands. Then was no such thing in any of them as a legal port till very lately. The ports here ere set out by commission. But the court of Exchequer has always considered going into the usual harbour as a going into port, though no part may be legally set out. ouch b the case at the present day with respect to Jersey and Guernsey.

It b said that no fraud can arise. The inten* Mr. Justice Heath asked if that had been

tion of the legislature was, that the British vessel should be the carrier from the extreme limbi. The ether aide would contend that if it was to go round the world with the cargo, the policy of the Act requires rather that that should be encouraged than discouraged—for more shipping would be employed.

But direct carrying b required—because if a circuitous voyage were allowed, it would be diMr cult to determine whether goods were taken in at an intermedbte place or not. It b not like thorn cases where goods are put in the custody of the law.

A direct carrying means u direct as in the nature of the thing it can be. You could net pro* vent touching at the usual ports $ but they cannot cany indirectly, so as to have an opportunity to commit fraud.

The destination of the wine from Madeira b stated aa follows:—Consigned to order at Su Butea-tius or dtewhero. I never saw such a consignment. The claim should have gone on to aver that the penon at St. Eusutius did give an order, if them was one. Did he address it to Jamaica, IsncaaUfr or what other place ? If to Great Britain, the as-tide could not be legally landed at Jamaica; if to Jamaica, it could not be brought to Great Britain, But if they mean to make out that it was ordered to be landed in Jamaica, that should be stated in the claim. If it was either actually or conditionally to be landed at Jamaica, it could not be carried to Great Britain, supposing the bw to require a direct importation to Great Britain. If they are right in law that such conditional carrying b legal* there b nothing in their sense to shew that the original destination was followed up bp any thing done at St. Eusutius. St. Eustotiut me duwhen b executory. What b there to fix it more to St. Eusutius than elsewhere. They might then go to any part of the world to receive orders. Suppoee they had gone to Lancaster, they might say it was for orders—I do not contend that that b a necessary but it b a passible construction. There b nothing in thb claim to shew that the master did at St. Eusutius receive order* to go to Jamaica or elsewhere. If no such order was given, the voyage was complete at the place where they were to receive orders.

As to the question, whether Madeira is in Europe or Africa, if the sixth section only prohibiu goods of the growth of Europe, the seventh would be useless if the goods enumerated in it were not considered as goods of Europe. If Madeira b not to be taken as a part of Europe, why is there n proviso to lessen a prohibition in a case to which the prohibition cannot apply ? So by the 4th Geow III. ch. 15. no European goods are to be landed in the plantations, unless they are wholly and bona fide shipped here, with an exception of Madeira. It has been uniformly considered in the

legislative map of the world, that Madeira and the Azores are in Europe.

Then, as to the direct carrying, those who say 'that taking the wine to St. Eustatius is a direct canying, must also contend that it is lawful to go round the world, and that the article kept on board may visit every port and be landed at last. If that is the intention, it is odd the Act should be not directly imported, but directly carried.

That the construction which I contend for is light may be collected from other Acts in pari materid. The stat* 31 Geo. III. ch. 34. recites, that it is expedient that the crapes of Italy should not be imported except directly, and prohibits any 'from being imported or brought (which is synonymous to earned) otherwise. Before that time 'they could be brought from any place. The legislature saw the mischief of that. If it is contended that any thing is imported directly from thence, after having gone all round the world; that is prevented by the term brought; and brought and carried have the same signification.

The same word is used guardedly in 27 Geo. III. c. 19. with respect to what may be imported from Gibraltar. Goods of the dominions of the Emperor of Morocco may be imported or brought Into Great Britain which have been imported directly into Gibraltar from those dominions. Those who contend, that in the present case there is a direct carrying from Madeira to Jamaica, must contend, that the last-mentioned Act is satisfied if 'the goods are first brought to Great Britain, then to Gibraltar, and after being there ten years are brought to Great Britain again.

The same observation arises upon the commercial treaty with France carried into effect by Act of Parliament—27 Geo. III. ch. 13. It shall be lawful to import or bring directly from France any of the specified articles. If they went round the world to Great Britain, is that within the meaning of the legislature, speaking of bringing goods directly from France. It was the policy of this Act to prevent circuitous voyages, and the same words should not have a different construction upon the two Acts. I admit that this Act should have the same construction as the fourth section of the Navigation Act, where the words are shipped or brought, I understand, the distinction which has "obtained is, that if goods are taken to a place, but have not been unladen, they cannot be said to be shipped there, but they may be said to be brought, which word conveys a different idea.

If the property had not been landed in Jamaica, but brought to Great Britain, and seized because It was not brought directly, the respondents might zay M I have a right to land it—my consignment 3s to order at St. Euetatiu* or elsewhere—how do Wou know that the order was to land in Great Britain The onus lies on them to shew the destination for Jamaica—they have shewn no such

thing in their claim—there is nothing in that which would not enable them to say—w I did not bring it from Jamaica, but from Madeira, calling at St. Eustatius and Jamaica. No order appears to land at Jamaica. It must be taken to be landed at the ultimate destination of the vessel, which was Great Britain.

Dr. Nicholls.—The facts are perfectly agreed, and the question is, whether the wine was imported, under the permission of the second clause* As to the question respecting the site of Madeira, that has been completely done away by the Attorney-General. For the purposes of revenue, Madeira is considered to be in Europe. If so, this importation is prohibited by the 6th section—is it allowed by the 7th ?—for being a proviso the patty must shew himself to be clearly within the permission of that proviso. Two questions have been made—first, whether a direct importation is required—second, whether this is a direct importation. As to the first: the seventh section expressly requires the wine to be laden at Madeira, and transported into the British plantations. Can the word transported authorise them to send to St» Eustatius, giving power to a person there, either to take the commodity or send it on ? So, the words of the 7th section imply, that the navigation must be direct. By referring to the former clause, to lade and transport, in the proviso, means the same as to cany directly in the preceding section. The proviso is not an exception as to the manner of carrying, but only as to the place from which the article may be carried. The policy of the Act equally requires a direct carriage from Madeira to Jamaica.

As to the second point, I apprehend there is not a direct importation, unless the article be destined originally for a British colony, without an intent to land at an intermediate place. Then here is a merit it t terminus which renders the carriage indirect. It cannot be said there was no importation at St. Eustatius; all the wine was consigned there so far as related to the act of the lader, and the subsequent act of the consignor, at St. Eustatius, makes an importation and re-exportation. The case of the Columbus was mentioned by all the advocates on the other side. It does not apply, or if it did, the protest would prevent its operating as a precedent. But the difference is, that the wine there was not destined either for a French port, or a British port, in the West Indies, but for London. The ship was driven by stress of weather, into Madeira, where some wine was bought. It went to dispose of some herrings at Tobago. Having an opportunity Of getting some lumber there, in exchange for that, left some wine which was not destined there. The chief ground of seizure was the lumber, and not the Madeira, which was consigned for London.

Those at Madeira, could not shew the destination to Jamaica. There are certain cockets dispensed with as to Madeira, because there is no British custom-house there, but the original documents must shew the destination. It is said, if these goods were liable to forfeiture, those dripped at Lancaster were so too. But they were originally destined for Jamaica, and were only at St. Eustatius in transitu.

As to what is said about usage, I do not admit but deny the fact. The practice may have been overlooked, but there is no usage or custom to authorise it. The other side argued on the policy of the Act; but the policy is not merely the employment of British shipping. There is another dbject, which is to supply the plantations as cheaply as poariMe and maintain a greater correspondence with them. The more cheaply they are supplied, the more the general objects of the Act will be effectuated. But if the ships are permitted to hawk the goods at intermediate ports, they must be worse aupplied and pay higher freights. Instead of rendering the supply more cheap, it would destroy the policy of the Act.

IN REPLY.

Mr. Habdingb.—The simplicity of the point made by the respondents, is equal to the force and dearness of it. As to the mode of daim and want of strict averment, a claim of this kind it not required to be so strict as a plea, and it is a violent and not an obvious interpretation, which is put upon it by the Attorney-General. For the goods hi question had originally a conditional destination. This is a penal Act in restraint of commerce, therefore, in the prohibiting part it is to be construed in as limited, and in the exception from the penalty, in as extensive a sense as the words will permit.

The questions, as has been often stated, are, whether the carriage of Madeira must be as direct as is necessary for the dry goods from Lancaster, and whether, if that be the law, the actual carriage was indirect.

The first point is in a word. The 6th section is applied to European goods strictly considered, they are to be earned in a certain specific manner, they are to be laden in England, in English-built shipping, the master and three-fourth of the marines are to be English, and the carriage it to be direct. Such is the first clause. "What is the second ? It provides that Madeira wine may be shipped at Madeira, and may be carried to our Foreign plantations in ships described by the preceding clause, or in other words, as they ought have been before this Act of Parliament. I could concede that the want of the word directly in the

VOL. II.

second clause is a mere dip, be it so, the slip is fatal.

Sir William Scott said, that as the two parts were in pari materie they must have tho nine construction, but being in patri materia cannot extend a penal Act. If that was enough, why was not it sufficient to aay, Madeira wines may to shipped at Madeira. Then, the preceding dausw might in other respects attach; but it says, ta such thipt so navigated, that shews that in the minds of the legislature there was a necessity it should to expressed. They would equally see the necessity of requiring directness if such was the intention.— " Transport* was said by Dr. Nicholl to to equivalent to u carry direct" but I deny the exposition.

If there had been nothing in the first clause but that the carriage should be direct, and then the proviso had interposed, or if there had been two separate Acts, will any man aay, that because they were in pari materie, the second omitting the words of the first would be deemed to have the construction of the fine. The clause extends not only to Madeira but also to salt, and aa to being in pari materie, that privilege is extended by Stat. 13 Geo. 1. ch. 5. to salt sent to Pennsylvania* It contains a legislative direction that salt may be carried and imported [not directly but] in the manner prescribed by 12 Chas. 2. There is similar provision by 3 G. 2. ch. 12. with respect to New York. Is it contended that the carnage may be circuitous to Pennsylvania and New York, but must be direct to other placet ?

But whatever the clause may import as to the first point, if we come within the second the goods are perfectly safe, that is, directly carried according to the meaning of the Act, which is not reexported. Will it be said, that this wine, which was not made over to the consignee at St. Eusta-tiua, was exported from thence. The Act of Parliament says, no—the lading was not there.

As to the ground of constructive and virtual importation, 1 agree that fraud in the intentioai to import is not necessary to constitute an importation, but there must be an animus impotlundi, which must be manifested by some overt act at the port. Suppose there were a manifest intention at Madeira to import the whole at St. Eustatius, and in the intermediate passage that intention was completely abandoned—it would be tho same as if there never was any such intention at all—but here there never was such purpose, and though it is argued that it was the intention of the laden to land the whole, that b not true. The intention was to land not the whole, but what the consignees might want. Hus was not wanted—therefore it was not intended to be imported—and it makes no difference whether it wag or was not defendant on tha option of the con* aignees.

When we are told of the policy of the Act, it i! safer to cut the knot than loose it. Be the argument ever ao sound, that the goods would not be sold'So cheaply, it is enough to say, that the Act might intend by a general remraint to prevent taking goods except in a particular manner, and yet not intend to prevent it in this respect even for effectuating the tame general pur-gore.

Dr. Lawrkncs.—In the Court below, the case was argued merely upon this point:—That the importation must be absolutely direct—and that there must be no greater deviation than is allowed upon policies of insurance. The Attorney General has not pursued that principle* The case was intended to be argued on legal grounds, and not upon any dispute of facts as it has been here *

Observations have been made on the policy of the Act, as it appears in the preamble—that it was intended the navigation should be made cheaper, which would require a direct voyage. It is by no means a necessary consequence, that the colonics would be supplied cheaper by a direct voyage s a circuitous voyage might have that effect u many

A preliminary point has arisen ss to the geography of Madeira. It is argued, that it should be considered as an European and not at an African island, although it geographically belongs to Africa *

No inference can he drawn from this Act—because it is the immediate subject in dispute—and the clause in the 4th Geo. III. is cskulated to avoid this confusion. There is not a word in it about European goods. It only speaks of ships coming from Europe. The wording of the Act does not give, but rather avoids the construction in question* With regard to the quarters of the world, the legislature, in the Navigation Act, describes them in a sweeping manner, by referring to the usual designation in cards and maps.

As to construing Madeira to be for the purposes of this Act in Europe—because otherwise the 7th Section would be an exceptio a non deecriptis—we all know very well how exceptive clauses get into Acts of Parliament. Particular facts may be suggested, and amendments are frequently made; but a mere inference from an exception will not overturn the ideas arising from the general part.

It is contended, on the other ride, that there must not be such a deviation as would destroy a policy of insurance. In cases of insurance the smallest deviation is fatal. In a case lately decided in the House of Lords, a vessel which had liberty to touch at Leith touched a few miles be• No Goods of Africa, Aria, or America, or of any part thereof, or which are described or laid down in the usual cards or maps of those places shall be imported, Ac. c.

low—and it was held, to vitiate the policy, m cruising by a letter of masque destroys the inur-ance* The principle of these cases is, that the deviation vanes the risk* What would be the consequences to British commerce, if the same strictness was necessary under all the Acts which, require a direct importation ? By the book of rates, all drugs imported directly from the place of their growth in English-built shipping, are to be rated it only one-third of what is charged in the book* Drugs are brought from a variety of places—but, according to the doctrine contended for, the ship cannot stop any where. By 22 Geo. HI. c 78. Hungarian drugs are to be impasted directly. Must ships, having these aboard, never stop any where? There are many ocher Acre upon which a similar absurdity would arise.

The Attorney General says the legislature (fid not intend to say goods might go all over die globe. Certainly no such thing was in the contemplation of the legislature. If their construction mum prevail in this case, it must in all—and the consequence will be, that you can only carry one kind of goods. There was a case which arose in 1681, respecting some worm seed, which wan brought from Leghorn in an English-built ship* and was alleged to have been brought to Leghorn in another English-built ship—and Mr. ward* then Attorney General, was consulted whether this was a direct importation, which entitled to an easement of duty under the book of rates; and he was of opinion that it was not, there being u mediae termimu. But in that case there were two distinct voyages on distinct interests. The King’s Advocate alluded to the opinion in the Court below, but it hat been since published— (Reeves’ Law of Shipping, 171)—and therefore he did not adduce it again. There are other opinions by Mr. Saunders and Sir Edward Northey (Reeves, 173. 175.) In other cases of direct importation, no such direct voyage without deviation is required.

The words of the clause are not only porithrer but also negative—that the goods shall oe carried directly from England, and from no other place or places whatsoever. The negative words are clear interpretations of the others; they shew that direct means no more than only, and that a direct importation is something different from a direct voyage *

This exposition is confirmed by Acts which have taken place concerning the ISth Section of the Navigation Act, which directs that none of the enumerated commodities shall be shipped, carried, conveyed, or transported from the plantations, except to some of our other plantations or to this country, there to be laid on shore. This is referred to by various Acts of Parliament using the word direct. In particular the 4th of Geo. HL cb* 15. sec. 27* adding to the enumerated article *

This is an interpretation of the legislature, the object of which was only to add to the enumerated articles, sad shews what is considered as a direct importation. It is the act of landing that constitutes the indirectness, or if there is any thing equivalent to hading it is that. The interpretation of the kpditore, as well as the fair interpretation of the words is, that there ahall not be a hading or any thing equivalent. I must complain of the niceties which nave been used. It was intended to by down a general rule of law, and make this a leading ewe. Any observations on woads are inoon-astern with that intention.

it b said there were circumstances which were applicable to foe wine and not to foe dry goods, so that the one was forfeitable and the other not, because the dry goods were never intended to be landed at St. Eustattus. The original intention respecting the wine was each as the master afterwards carried into execution. It is, I apprehend, sufficient if foe conrignee says not hero, but there. It is not said laid—i until, that he did direct the wine to be carried to Jamaica, but k is not fio be* —that became that a net formally expreaaad, the contrary must be inferred. The argument upon the eubjoct rather applies to procure a condemnation of fob ship than to produce a general

As porta are mentioned, in many Acts of Parliament rejecting the West Indies, the word must he taken quasi port, but k should appear that the goods were there for importation. In foe clause, introducing the principle of the Hovering Act into the 4th Geo. llL the vessel b permitted to stay off four-nd-twenty hours. It b the usual course of trade to tend into part, within that time, to know the state of the market, and then to act ac-ooidiogky. Under a similar practice, the master might send to Ewtetius, and make inquiry, and afterwards come in If it does not appear that he actually did go in at first, sod induigenciee of that kind are usually allowed, the Court will not entertain a presumption against him, to make a particular case for the condemnation of fob vessel.

That direct importation was intended to be con-tneced with no ether place b agreeable to divers ether Acts, end appears to be foe seme of the legislature, by Acts which would cramp and destroy trade, if the word direct was construed to require such a voyage without deviation, as is necessary upon policies of insurance.

Ib all foe instances where questions have been

raised, the goods were actually taken out of foe •hip. There b no proof of any absolute and complete intention, between Madeira and Jamaica, to land more than was actually boded at St. Eustacius. If the Court presume any thing, it will be in favour of the master, who made no concealment, and if kb necemmy to enter upon that point, they will presume that he did not go into St. Eustatius, until hb intention what to laud was fixed. There have been caeca in which the officers of the Crown have held the importation to be direct, though the goods wuse actually taken out of the ship.

In oidtr to nave the way to the decision of the third point, toe minor end very insignificant question upon the particular language of the claim must have .been determined in favour of the respondents.

As the case of the Columbus was so frequently referred to, it may not be amiss to insert the following statement of the circumstances of that case, from Sir James Marriott's judgment, as k is reported in the Collectanea Juridica, vol. 1. p. 82. Premising that the seizure was made principally on tile ground of Stat. 27 Geo. 3. cap. 39. whereby lumber, imported from any of the ports of the American States, is prohibited, if brought Indirectly from any foreign plantations.

" The ship Columbus duly cleared and sailed out from London, in ballast, November 14, 1786, for Gottenburgh, in Sweden. There the master took in a cargo of dried herrings. The mariner's contract expresses that the intended voyage was to be from London to Gottenburgh, and from thence to Tobago, and elsewhere. She accordingly sailed from Gottenburgh, the 14th of Jan. 1787, for Tobago; meeting with a hard gale of wind, and being in want of water, she put into Madeira, on the 7th of March, to water and repair. The matter took in Madeira wines, in barter for some of the herrings, and having repaired his ship, and taken In water and other necessaries, sailed for Tobago, where he arrived the 2d of April, and there, by permiakm of the French governor, the captain disposed of the remainder of his herrings, and part of kis Madeira wines, for landing of which he obtained a permit, from the French custom-house «t Tobago, except ten pipes, two hogsheads, and three quarter casks. While the riiip was lying at Tobago, he purchased on behalf of, and shipped on account of his owners, a quantity of lumber, the growth of the dominions of the united States of America.

They were shipped to be imported into the

island of Barbedoes, with an intent for the ship Xp take in a lading of sugars for London upon freight. The master at this time had received no information of the peering the Act of the 27th of George the Third, forbidding such importation indirectly from the ports of the United States of America. The master, having completed bin landing at Tobago, purchased from a French vessel lying there twenty-three or twenty-five dosen of claret in bottles as stares for the ship's use, stowed them with other liquors in his lockers in his cabin, and on the 24th sailed for Barbadoes. This darec was purchased partly by Madeira wine in exchange, and partly by a small bill of exchange.

On the 7tn of June, 1787, upon the moment of the ship’s arrival, before die could come to anchor, she was seized by Mr. Samuel Deardey, then acting as collector of the customs for the poet of Bridge Town. An information was filed in the Vice-Admiralty Court at Barbadoes by Deanley, charging this coming-in as an importation into the island of Barbadoes, contrary to the several Acte of the Revenue, particularly the 12th and 15th Chas. II. and the 4th and 24th of George the Third, and his royal proclamation of the 8th of April, 1787—that part of the cargo was put on board at Tobago, an island in the West Indies, belonging to the French King; that it was the growth, and produce, and manufacture of the United States of America, the property of the subjects of the ssid state, or of some foreign state; that the wine, being the growth and produce of Europe, teas not shijped in England but Tobago; that, on his arrival, the master did not make a full report of his lading, and that ten cases of wine and other goods were found on board after the master had made his report.

The learned Judge minutely examined all these charges, and held, that there was no ground of leisure upon any of them.

* the registry of such ship or vessel shall be truly and accurately recited

(L) Previous to the Statute 26 Geo.

See the in-quhriee preparatory to the introduction of the Act—Reeves, & and N. p. 111. c. 6. The St tute 26 Geo. III. and the present Act have the credit of being founded upon very sound policy, and of having been attended with very beneficial effects in the attainment of their professed object; but certainly, like most other Acts which render the validity of contracts dependent upon a aeries of complicated regulations, they have been productive of several cases of very considerable hardship (arising in a great measure from the obscurity of their construction) as affecting the interest of individuals.

In Me. Neal’s case, Reeves and N. Lord Camden said, that the Statute 26 Gea 1IL was an Act which, in every view of it, should be considered as a remedial Act, and that therefore the rule of construction in applying and explaining it shoukfbe such as would most aid in advancing the meant of relief and the suppression of fraud; and should it* be countered.in any light as a penal law, he was dearly of opinion, that every thing arising; from suck a consideration should be con-trouled by the other character of it are remedial

justice than that which, in cases of doubt, would incline to subject to the very severs consequences of this system of law (be the policy of it in fihrour of certain monopolies ever so manifest) acts and omhrions that could only be brought within its operation by a construction which no ordinary prudence could anticipate.

In Meatier v. Gillespie, 11 Vesey, 621. the Mamer of the Rolls observed, that it might be the legiristure, having proposed the object, kI the only means by which, that object waa to be secured; judging of the propriety of enforcing that object, and, by inch' means, em* bracing that object ud prescribing those means, whatever inconvenience might result to private individuals. Ths harshness, therefore, in particular instance^ is not to be taken into consideration, the object not being to provide for the interests of parties as against %sch other; but at nil events, to obtain that great object of public policy to which it might be thought right to asm-fee individual convenience and justice according to ccdbmy rtdu.

In most of the cates upon the Act, the ydicy of it is dwelled upon in the highest scrams of commendation; with regard to which topic of. argument it Ins always appeared to me, that a court of justice is not exactly the place for discerning questions of policy with the greatest moother subject of legislation, .ss much security? should be given to fairness and integrity, and as. much care be taken to prevent the rendering mere inadvertence or unskilfulnen liable to the const* quences properly attached to intentional fraud, at may be consistent with the general policy which, the system of regularionsis intended to promote.

The most beneficial course for this purpose would apparently be to repeal the several Lews, respecting the built, property, transfer and navigation- of ships, and to name one general Act in* corporating the several provirions upon the subject* and such others at may be suggested, either-by, official experience or judicial determinations, according to a systematic arrangement, and in>plain: and perspicuous language. This purpose would, he facilitated by departing from the usual verbority, of Acts of Parliament, and enacting (according to the plan recently adopted in several instances upon matters of revenue) that the several rules contained in the Act should in future be.followed! with respect to the matters therein mentioned. These rules might be divided into several dmn as applicable to the different branches of the subject, for which arrangement considerable aaaial might be derived from the summary of the e mg law in the work of Mr. Reeves.

As a further matter of regulation it may be* proper to establish, that after the principal act .of.

- — --w i ----—w i / - v----i 9 K nrietv or advantage; but that every Act, which sale has been executed by the party interested*.

has the sanction of the legislature, should equally - L *’ ' J *—

be carried into execution and effect; according to its apparent intent and the established rules of legal construction, without either extending or contracting its operations upon any collateral views of its utility or inconvenience.

But ft it a very material question for legislative cenridemtion, whether all the objects of a public nature, winch it is thought material to provide for, may not be sufficiently attained without its being neceawry as a means for the accomplishment of that end to require a sacrifice of indhidml jestsco according to ordinary rvUI, or, in other words, according to them great and immutable principles, the support of which is the main pur-puae and Tnmt ementiri benefit of civil society.

I apprehend it may be taken for granted, that ifiD those arcmnatancta of notoriety, as to the Built, repairs, and property of a ship, which the object and purpose of this system of Law require, are saffitiently provided for, it wifi not be deemed of any aarvice to anperadd, that the provisions should be dispelled, complicated, obscure, or more inconvenient thair nay be conducive to the primary object, and that' in tidi as well

the subsequent acts should be performed by public officers, and that for this purpose the cei>* tificate of registry should, at the end of each, voyage, be placed in the hands of such officers, so. that a title otherwise good may not be defeated, by the fraud or obstinacy of the vendor or mitten. Perhaps it might not be ineligible to provide that, there should be two certificates, the one to be. kept with the ship as at present, and the other* to be retained on shore for the purposes of transfer, and that some distinction by printing in a. . different coloured ink, or otherwise, should be. adopted to prevent the substitution of the one for the other. As all transfers of property.require, some inchoate proceedings, I think tost no inconvenience could arise *from empowering Courts of* Equity, within a limited period, to enforce contracts of sale of ships as well as of other property'; that it would be expedient to ettiMiah separata regulations for the pledge of ships or. share*n& fodps; and that it would be peculiariy beneficial! to enable the Court of Admiralty, or aomeothetr proper tribunal, to take, cognisance in a summary, manner, with respect to the immediate poemmeat and employment of ships in cases of disputed title *

In proceeding to the points which have been determined on the operation of these Acts, ex* dusively of cases which are mentioned in the notes to the sections to the particular consideration of which they more' immediately relate, it is to premise, that in Long v. Duff, 2 B. and . it was held, that foreign ships, British owned, are not required to be registered.

The first case decided upon the construction of 26 Geo. III. c. 60. was Rolleston v. Hibbert, 3 T. R. 406. in which it was ruled, that an action of trover might be maintained against the defendant, to whom a ship had been transferred by absolute bill of sale, not made according to the provisions of the Act, but intended only as a security, and that the defendant had not any lien against the assignees of the person giving the bill of sale, and who had become bankrupt, (but nothing turned upon the bankruptcy.) Lord Kenyon aaid, it was not necessary that the property in a ship should pass by a written instrument, but if the parties chose to convey by a written instrument, they should not be permitted afterwards to refer to any other agreement. The opinion so expressed was the occasion of the provision in the text, that no transfer should be valid except by bill of sale, as prescribed by 26 Geo. III. In Wilson v. Hather, 5 Taunt. 642. a broker employed to sell a vessel advanced money upon her, and took an absolute bill of sale in proper form, undertaking to account for the difference if she produced more; but no copy of the indorsement of the certificate of registry was delivered to the proper officer, and other provisions of the Act were not complied with; and it was ruled, that the defendant had not any lien. Gibbs, C. J. said, The right of lien does not arise out of any contract whatever, but out of a right to hold property till the party claiming the lien 'has been paid for the operation he performs.*’ In the preceding case of Mestaer v. Atkins, 5 Taunt. 381. 1 Marshall, 76. it was held, that a broker employed to ell a ship had a lien on the papers put into his hands for the purpose, as all the cases on the Acts had been cases or transfer, where the ship might have been registered in performance of the contract, but that the defendant in the particular case could never have sent the ship to sea. Heath, J. observed, that his custody of the papers gave him no power over the ship.

In Rolleston r. Hibbert, Butter, J. expressed an opinion, that transfers by operation of law were excepted; and it was expressly decided, in Btaxam v. Hubbard, 5 East. 407. that the Register Acts do not apply to the assignment from the commissioners to the assignees of a bankrupt. In Reid v. Darby, 10 East. 143. it was ruled, that Vice Admiralty Courts abroad had no power to decree the sale of a ship found not sea wtathy; hut supposing there was such power, as the vessel was subsisting ss such, and capable of being used

for the purposes of navigation, the forms of the Register Acts must be complied with.

In Rolleston v. Smith 4 T. R. 161. the certi-. ficate of registry of a prise ship contained the words u as by sentence of condemnation dated 28th May 1783, and made free as by certificate granted 28tX January 1783, appear *, £fc." The real date of condemnation was the 28tlt of May 1782, and was so inserted in the certificate which was with, the vessel at sea) and in the collectors comptrollers and secretary's books~but in the register general's office frorp which the bill of sale was filled up it was stated to be the 28th May, 1783, and the mistake was held not to vitiate th$ sale*-Lord Kenyon said " There is one material circumstance to attend to, namely, xhe date of the certificate of freedom, which was in January, 1783; . now by comparing that date with the supposed date of condemnation in May, 1783, it is impossible that the latter could be correct, inasmuch as, the certificate of freedom would then bear date prior to the condemnation. It is apparent therefore on the face of the instrument itself that some, error must have crept into this copy of the certificate of the registry which was inserted in the bill of sale. Now it is impossible to conceive that the framers of this Act intended to prevent the sales of ships at sea, but the statute requires that - the certificate of registry shall be always on board the ship and that abstracts of it should be entered at several offices of which the registrar general’s is one. And it is stated in the cue that the par- '

, ties to this bill of sale applied to that office for a.> copy of the certificate entered in the public books] there, which they inserted in the bill of sale, ver-] batim st literatim, as it is there entered. They, could not have recourse to the original certificate* for that was necessarily on board the ship then at. sea; they went to that which was suppoaed*to be the most authentic depository of the certificate* and I do not see.what other step they could have. taken to comply with the requisites of the statutes—therefore we are of opinion that the bill of sale is valid notwithstanding this mistake. But. even supposing that the parties had had an opportunity of seeing the original certificate, it is too much to say that a mere clerical mistake should render it null and void. It is sufficiently ascertained in this bill of sale, that this is the same ship; the only variance between the copy and the original is in the figure 3 instead of 2, which appears, even on the face of the bill of sale itself^ to be necessarily a mistake. For these reasons there-, fore, and with a laudable inclination to support a fair and honest transaction, tit res magis valeaC quam pereat, at the same time not transgressing' the rules of law, we are of opinion that this bill at' sale was sufficiently valid." The marginal abstract of the case, which is copied into several treatises, imports generally that a mere clerical mistake will not vitiate the bill of sale; I have therefore

* It ii said tbit we must look for this purpose to *the- registers to see who are the legal owners. The object of the Registry Acts was to inform -Government whether the owners were British, and not to inform the tradesmen to whom they should give credit. The cases of Young and Brander, and Frazer and Marsh, both 'shew that a person may be deceived as to the true owner by merely looking at the registers, and that, therefore, before credit is given, it is proper for the tradesmen to inquire further.—These latter cases seem to go a great way in overruling the decision in Westeidell «. Dale; for it will be very difficult to support that case upon the mere distinction of a partnership as suggested by Lord RUenborough in Young and Brander, it being wholly foreign to the intention of the parties that there, should be any actual partnership at the time of the supply, and the question agitated was as to the general liability of the defendant, and *not as supposed in Young and Brander on the want of a plea in abatement of the joint liability •of the other party, who was supposed and intended to be sole owner at the time of the contract with the plaintiff.

According to the peculiar nature of this species •of property, I think it would be very deniable to make an express provision for a distinct mode of registry in case of transfer by way of security, and for denning the interests, powers, and obligations of the mortgagees. The policy of the Navigation Acts would probably require the mortgagee to •have the same qualifications as are necessary in the case of an owner, with the exception of •general trusts for the benefit of creditors or underwriters.

In Fraser v. Hopkins, 2 Taunt. 5—Tinkler v. Walpole, 14 E. 226. it was ruled, that the entry in the registers is not even sufficient primd facie evidence to charge a party as owner, unless shewn to be made by his authority. It is not sufficient evidence of ownership to support an averment of interest on a policy of insurance, Pirie v. Anderson, 4 Taunt. 652.

Although a bill of sale by way of mortgage is void, so far as regards the:property of the ship, for want of compliance with the register; it ii valid as to the personal covenants for payment of the money lent-^Kerriton v. Cole, 8 E. 231.

It was by accident omitted to insert a note upon "Sec. 8. 26 Geo. HI. c. GO. of the case of the Eleanor, 1 Edw. Adm, Rep. 135. in which it was

held by Sir Wm. Scott, that no person is entitled to the exclusive benefit who has not hia usual residence in Great Britain, or in the dominions belonging to the Crown. If he goes into another country, and there has a more usual residence than in this, he is no longer entitled to the same privilege. A person who is continuaUy'shifting his residence, so as not to have what under any extension can be deemed an usual residence here, does not come within the 'description of the statute. He must be, unlem in the cases which are specified, usually resident in this country.

(2.) As to the sale of a partial interest, see Underwood v. Miller, 1 Taunt. 387.

(3.) This section refers to the preceding, and relates only to an alteration in the same port; and, therefore, in case of a transfer of a ship at sea to a person reaiding in another, port it is not necessary for the ship to return to her former port, in order to have the memorandum indorsed on the certificate of registration, or for the purchaser to send a copy of the bill of sale to the former port, or to indorse a memorandum of the transfer on the certificate within ten days after the ship returns to England. The proper course in such case is to obtain a registration de pursuant to Statute 7 and 8 W. 3. c. 22. s.'21. Ruled in the Exchequer Chamber, Hubbard tv Johnstone, 3 Taunt. 177. contrary to what had been held in another case relating to the same transaction in Bloxam v. Hubbard, 5 E. 407. The case of Ruyter i?. Jackson, 8 E. 511. in which it was held that the transfer of a ship belonging to Sunderland to a purchaser in London, the ship at the time being in the Port of London, was void for want of compliance with the requisites of this or the preceding'section, seems to be also overruled by the'decision in Hubbard v. Johnstone.

(4.) The Court intimated their decided opinion, that the 16th Section related as well to the transfer of the entire property as of a share or shares in a ship. Hubbard v. Johnstone, 3 Taunt. 190.

Where a ship registered at the port of N. was transferred by a deed of assignment to owners resident in L., the ship being then in the port of L.: held, that this transfer was not within 34 Geo. 3. c. 68. s. 15. but within s. 16. of that Act: and that the transfer was valid, although no indorsement was made on the certificate of registry: held, also, that the non-compliance with 7 and 0 Will. 3. c. 22. a. 21. does not avoid the transfer.

herein-before mentioned, otherwise such bill of sale or contract or agreement for sale thereof shall be utterly null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever, and entry thereof shall be indorsed and a memorandum thereof made In the manner herein-before directed.

XVIII. And whereas by an Act passed in the twenty-eighth year of 28 Geo.3*c.34|

the reign of his present Majesty, intituled An Act more effectually to secure the Performance of Quarantine, and for amending several Laws rc- lating to the Revenue of Customs, certain provisions were amongst other things made to prevent the masters of ships or vessels from wilfully and maliciously detaining and refusing to deliver up the certificates of ships9 4 registry to the prejudice of the owners of such ships or vessels; And whereas the good purposes intended by those provisions have not been *

4 effected; ana it is therefore expedient to make further provisions for preventing the masters of ships or vessels from withholding certificates

4 of registry to the prejudice of the owners of such ships or vessels :9 Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in case the master of any ship or vessel who shall have received the certificate of the registry thereof, (whether such master shall be apart owner or not) shall wilfully •detain and refuse to deliver up the same to the proper officers (5.) empowered to make registry and grant a certificate thereof on the owner or 01 owners or the major part of the owners of such ship or vessel if such master has not any property therein, or on the other owner or owners or the major part of the other owners of such ship or vessel if such master bath any snare or property therein, requiring him so to do, it may and shall be lawful to and for the owner or owners or the major part of the owners of such ship or vessel, the certificate of registry of which shall be detained and refused to be delivered up as aforesaid, to make complaint on oath against the master of the ship or vessel who shall so detain and . refuse to aeliver up the same, of such detainer and refusal to any justice of the peace residing near to the place where such detainer and refusal .shall be in Great Britain or to any member of the supreme court of Justice, ur any justice of the peace in the islands of Jersey Guernsey or Man, or in any colony plantation island or territory to his Majesty belonging in America jot the West Indies, where such detainer and refusal shall be in any of the places last-mentioned, and on such complaint the said justice or other magistrate shall and is hereby required by warrant tinder his hand and seal to cause such master to be brought before him, to be examined touching such detainer and refusal; and if it shall appear Penalty toe to the said justice or other magistrate on examination of the master or withholding otherwise that the said certificate of registry is not lost or mislaid but is Cenifkites. wilfully detained by the said master, such master shall be thereof conMode of Plots.)

XX. And whereas it is expedient that the officers empowered to make registry of ships and vessels and to grant certificates thereof in case any such ship or vessel is required to be registered de novo, should be authorised to require the production of every bill or other instrument of sale by which the property in any ship or vessel is transferred; * Be It BPTO Rc" therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That when and so often as the SSStrf VTFV7 *", *?* 8h*P ?r vef^ Stops'"? to any of hi* Majesty’s subjects.

That in case there be any alteration of property in the same port by the sale of one or more shares in any ship after registering thereof, such sale shall always be acknowledged by indorsement on the certificate of the register before two witnesses, in order to prove that the entire property in such ship remains to some of

* ' (3.) This does not confine the exemption to loss or damage happening to the piloted ship and cafgo, ' but extends to damages done by that ship to others. Ritchie v. Bowsfield, 7 Taunt. 309.

(4.) An owner or master of a vessel is in no case . answerable for an accident, occasioned to another ship, provided he has a Pilot on board. Nor is it necessary to prove, in an action brought against such owner, that the injury arose from the Incompetency of his Pilot. Bennet v. Maita, 1 Moore, 4. . C. 7 Taunt. 258.

(5.) In Camthers v. Sidcbottom, East. 1815. (not reported at the time of printing this sheet),

it was ruled that the Underwriters on a Policy of Insurance are answerable for a loas occasioned by the neglect or want of skill of a Pilot appointed under a local Act. A case had been previously argued in the Exchequer (the Attorney-General v, Cate) upon the question whether the owners of a ship are liable for an injury done to .• another vessel by the neglect or misconduct of such Pilot, upon which no decision has been given; but the question seems to be decided by Camthers v, Sidebottom, as involving the general principle, that the acts of a Pilot so appointed are not imputable to the owners of a ship.

(6*) Coasting vessels, not within the 52 Geo. 3* c. 39. are compellable to take a Pilot on board, on entering rivers within the limits of a jurisdiction having authority to appoint and license Pilots, and the exemption in the Act is not confined to coasters using the navigation of the river Thames alone.

LXVIII. And whereas it frequently happens that officers of the customs and excise, who from their stations on the coast, and other circumstances, are instrumental in causing the seizure of spirits and other goods, but who, from their not being actually present at and assisting in the making such seizure, have hitherto not been considered as entitled to participate in the officers’ share of the same: And whereas it is expedient in order to provide for such cases, that the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs and Excise respectively should be authorized to direct distribution of the shares of all seizures made by officers or persons acting under their authority or direction, or of any penalties recovered or lewards paid for the apprehension of smugglers, in such manner as may appear to them to be most conducive to the protection of the revenue; be it therefore enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Commissioners of His Majesty’s Customs or Excise respectively, and they are hereby authorized, in case of any seizure of vessels boats or goods, or the apprehension of any parties under this or any other Act refitting to the revenue of

Class II.] Skip-Owners, Mariners, and fisheries.

all manner of doubling planks that may be wrought upon the sides of the ship, then multiplying the length of the keel by the breadth so taken, and that product by naif the breadth, and dividing the whole by ninety-four, the quotient shall be deemed the true contents of the tonnage.

XVIII. And whereas it would in some cases endanger ships or vessels to cause them to be laid on shore; be it therefore enacted, That in cases where it may be necessary to ascertain the tonnage of any ship or vessel when afloat, according to the foregoing rule, the Tollowing method shall be observed; that is to say, drop a plumb line over the stem of the ship, and measure the distance between such line and the after part of the stem post at the load water mark; then measure from the top of the plumb line, in a parallel direction with the water, to a perpendicular point immediately over the load water mark at the fore part of the main stem, subtracting from such measurement the above distance, the remainder will be the ship’s extreme, from which is to be deducted three inches for every foot of the load draught of water for the rake abaft, also three-fifths of the ship’s breadth for the rake forward, the remainder shall be esteemed the just length of the keel to find the tonnage; and the breadth shall be taken from outside to outside of the plank in the broadest part of the ship, whether that shall be above or below die main wales, exclusive of all manner of sheathing or doubling that may be wrought on the side of the ship; then multiplying the length of the keel for tonnage by the breadth so taken, and that product by half the breadth, and dividing by ninety-four, the quotient shall be deemed the true contents of the tonXIX. Provided always, and be it further enacted, That in each of the several rules herein-before prescribed, when used for the purpose of ascertaining the tonnage of any ship or vessel propelled by steam, the length of the engine room shall be deducted from the whole length of such ship or vessel, and the remainder shall, for such purpose, be deemed the whole length of the same.

XX. And be it further enacted, That whenever the tonnage of any ship or vessel shall have been ascertained according to the rule herein prescribed (except in the case of ships or vessels which have been admeasured afloat), such account of tonnage shall ever after be deemed the tonnage of such ship or vessel, and shall be repeated in every subsequent registry of such ship or vessel, unless it shall happen that any alteration has been made in the form and burthen of suen ship or vessel, or it shall be discovered that the tonnage of such ship or vessel had been erroneously taken and computed.

XIV. And be it further enacted, That from and after the said first day of September one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, every suen notary public, or other person as aforesaid, shall be entitled to a sum of four shillings for protesting any foreign bill of exchange, over and above all stamp duty payable upon such protest, and also over and besides the sum of one shilling for registering and copying such bill, as herein-before provided.

1 and increase the general wealth of the realm. Her Majesty’s customs and the strength of shipping; which consideration is now the more requisite because trade and traffic is not at this present so open as at other times it hath been: And whereas it hath been time out of mind an usage amongst merchants both of this realm and of foreign nations when they make any great adventure, (especially into remote parts,) to give some consideration of money to other persons (which commonly

* are in no small number) to have from them assurance made of their goods, merchandises, ships, and things adventured, or some part thereof,

III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person shall be grieved by sentence or decree of the said commissioners that such persons so grieved may at any time'within two months of the said decree so made exhibit his bill into the High Court of Chancery for the re-examination of such decree; so as every person complainant, before he shall exhibit any such bill do either execute and sausfy the said sentence so awarded, or at the least laydown in deposito with the said commissioners such sums of money as he shall be awarded to pay, and that upon so doing the said complainant shall be enlarged of nis imprisonment: and that the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper for the time being shall have full power and authority by virtue or this Act upon every complaint made (in order as aforesaid) to reverse or affirm every such sentence or decree according to equity and conscience: And that the said Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper in every such suit brought before him as aforesaid by such assurers and decreed against the said assurers shall award double costs to the party assured.

But this Statute not entirely answering the intention of the Legislature, some further regulations were made by e subsequent Statute: such as the reduction of the number necesnry to constitute a quorum. I forbear entering at length into this matter, the Court erected by these Statutes bring mow entirely disused. The reasons of this may foe collected from some few decisions in our Reporters:but one appears on the face of the Statute itself, namely, that its jurisdiction was not sufficiently extensive, being confined to such causes only as ante m London.

u By a case reported in Style we find, that a prohibition issued to the Court of Policies of Insurance, to prevent it from proceeding in a case of insurance upon t life, the Court of King's Bench being of opinion, that the Statute only meant to give the Court below cognisance of such mdsdf only as related to Merchandize.

* In another case it seemed to be the opinion Vol. II.

of foe Court of King's Bench, that the juristic* tion of this newly-erected court did not extend to suits brought by the assurer against the assured; but only to such as were prosecuted by the latter against the former. It is true, in Sir Bartholomew Shower’s note of the case, no decision appears t# have been made; but a rale to shew cause why s prohibition should not imue, was obtained; an# no notice b afterwards taken of it, although th# learned Reporter was himself the Counsel in th# cause, who bad obtained the original rule.

* But a case reported in 8ideifin, seems t» have struck a more severe blow at the exbtencv of thb court than any of thoee cases 1 have mm* tioned; for It was there held, that It was no her to an action upon a Policy of Insurance at th# common law to say, that the plaintiff had sued the defendant for the same cause, in the Court erected by the Statute of Elisabeth, mi that hb suit was mere dismissed.

u These causes cooperating, together probably with some instances of patriality in the Judges^ rids Court fell into disuse, no commbskm having issued for many years; but Insurance causae arw now decided, like all other questions of property* and by that mode of trial most agreeable la th# nature of our Constitution, by a trial in a Court of common law.

M It has been much the frahion of late yean t# insist upon the advantages which the trwmig part of the nation would derive from the tatablbhment of some equitable end amicable judicatory for the trial of all disputed points in matters of Insurance* This b only another proof of the weakness and fallibility of the human mind, which b never satisfied with things within its reach, however

i Court erected by the Statute of Elisabeth, and which has now fallen into disuse, is perhaps one of the strongest arguments that can be adduced to prose that such a judicature is not congenial to the spirit and disposition of Britons, nor well sdapted for the purposes of its Institution. It is universally: agreed by all writers upon jurisprudence, that nothing tends so much to rite ehictthtkm of truth and the detection of fraud, as the open vital vote examination of witnemea, in the presence of all mankind; before judges who from their knowledge-of books and men, acquired by long study and experience, are well qualified to discriminate and decide between right and wrong; and before twelve upright ritisens, who have an opportunity of observing the appearance, coupmnance, inclination, and-deportment of those who are thus examined upon oath. Besides the subjects of those states, which have established these equitable tribunals, sensible of the superior advantages of the English institution, feeling that in great mercantile questions, the greatest atten- tidRIrpdd to the eternal and immutable priori-pfcl’af reason, and that all man, whether natives <*faragners, here meet with an equal measure, in the admutiatrattoo of justice, fly to this country to make their contracts of Insurance, that in tase of a dispute they may have the benefit of its

(1.) In Lees v. Smith, 7 T. R. 338. where several person* mutually agreed to insure the vessels of each other, and there was a clause, that in case any of them should become insolvent the others should be answerable for his proportion, this mutual security was held to constitute a partnership, and to bring the agreement within the reach of the prohibition. 1 doubt whether the reasoning in this case was altogether correct; foe. although a joint and mutual liability necessarily attaches upon and results from a copartnership, it does not follow that it necemarily constitutes one; or, that as there can be no partnership without s joint responsibility, there can be no joint responsibility without a partnership. Upon

the case in question, it would not hive been sufficient (supposing the statute out of the question) to have sued a contributor, as a partner primarily liable in respect of the original engagement, but would have been essentially requisite to have proceeded upon the special contract, with an express averment of the insolvency of the particular insurer, for whose deficiency the others were respectively liable to contribute.

In Cockbum v. Thompson, 16 Ves. 328. it was said by Lord Eldon, arguendo, that any number of persons may associate for the insurance of each other; all in effect participating as a partnership. Where s partnership was entered into, in com vention or the statute, it was ruled, that or

the partners had no claim upon the ocher for a proportion of the lomct which he had paid.— Mitchell t>. Cockburne, 2 H. Black. 379. Where three persons were in partnership, and the policies were in the name of one of them, and another, together with a partner of his own, (to which partnership there is no legal objection; ) were the brokers, the assignees of the person whose name was used were not allowed to recover from those brokers the premiums received. Booth «. Hodgson, 6 T. R. 405. It had been previously held by Lord Kenyon, at Nisi Prhts, that an underwriter, who had paid a loss, could not recover from the broker the money which the broker had received from another person, who had agreed to take half the plaintiff's risque, his Lordship.saying, that a party could not appeal to a court of justice to enforce a contract founded upon a breach of the law—Sullivan v. Greaves, Park, 8; but it has been since ruled by the Court of Common Pleas, that a broker, to whom the underwriter had paid the loss on an illegal policy, could not resist paying it over to the assured— and they even refused to grant a rule to shew cause why there should not be a new trial; which decision certainly cannot, in principle, be reconciled to that before Lord Kenyon. These cases had occurred previously to the appearance of a small tract on insurance, which I published in the year 1801; in which I submitted some observations on the correctness of the principles which were adopted in Booth and Hodgson, and Sullivan and Greaves. The observations were afterwards ingrafted into a general discussion on the illegality of contracts, which I introduced into the Appendix to the Translation of Pothier—and which 1 have thought it eligible to add to the present work, (see Appendix, No. I.)

In Aubert v. Maze, 2 Bos. & PuL 371. an award that the defendant should pay the plaintiff a certain sum, being a moiety of divers sums of money paid by the defendant, on account of policies underwritten at their joint risk, was set aside. This decision appears fully to accord with what I apprehend to be the true legal principles upon the subject—there being no other obligation subsisting between the parties than the illegal contact of partnership. But in the discussion of the case many sentiments were advanced in contradiction of those, which I have repeatedly endeavoured to maintain, as illustrated by the great dees of Faikney v. Reyaons, and Petrie v. Han-nay, wkh regard to the collateral extenrion of the consequences of illegal contracts, as to which see the Number of the Appendix, above referred to Lord Eldon said, that if the principle of these caeca was to be supported, the Act of Parliament would be of very little use—meaning, of course, tjfict end operation/*—for as to the real use of the Act of Parliament, except by way of sale of a ntomyty to the chattered companies, it would

perhaps he rather difficult to discover in what circumstance it can be found. But maintaining, as steadily as any man, the propriety of a writt conformity to the authority of the legislature, even upon subjects where 1 should not be dispose^ to join in admiration of its wisdom, I think that the consequence supposed would by no mesne follow—if, as in the cases of Faikney «. Reynons, and Petrie v. Hannay, the party protected from payment by means of the illegality of hie interest, and who had subsequently prevailed upon another person to advance his money in execution of it, fc merely held bound by such subsequent act. The joint object of the Act was t secure the compn-nies from the competition of other bodies pledging the responsibility of a common fund. Such competition is completely and effectually excluded, to aU legal purposes, by the mere operation of the Act; whereby any such insurance is absolutely void, and any partnership founded in contravention of the pronibition can produce no legal obligation. The decisions in Faikney r. Reynom, and Petrie v. Hannay, do not in the slightest degree contravene that principle, and only acknowledge the subsistence of an obligation arising front the subsequent act, occurring at a time when no illegal object is in contemplation, whereby e third person is induced to advance his property—upon the request and promise of the party intended to be charged—and is protected from k»~!-by precluding the defendant from alleging, that he was not liable at the time of the advance to pay the demand, in satisfaction of which he had requested such property to be applied—it being admitted, by those who are most strenuous in denying such obligation, that if the defendant had received the money upon a loan to himself, with the acknowledged view of applying it to such a purpose, k would have been an obligatory contract; and that the only difference is between the circuity of the money being borrowed by and handed to A, and by him paid over to B, and its being paid to B in in the first instance, without its passing through the hands of A.

• In Brunton v. Taddy, 1 Taunt. 6. upon an ao ttoa for premiums of insurance, the Defendant proved an agreement between the plaintiff and third persons, that the profits* upon the policies underwritten, by the Plaintiff should be divided between them-*—whereupon the plainuff waanour suited. Upon an application to seteride the sow suit, Mansfield, C. J.said, "Tbelawseya* that no persons, acting in partnership, shall prnwnna tn underwrite any policy for aawring ships or merchandise at sea, out that every such polity *haB be ipso fmeto void. How then can an action ho maintained to recover these premiums ?

defendant, at the time of effecting the polity, understood and knew, that it was on the joint ac-, couat of the plaintiff and the person with whom he was engaged in an illegal partnership—this clause is the mere result of the dear and undis-. puled rules of law—the policy would have beeu void—the defendant could have recovered nothing in case of loss—the plaintiff would have had no . legal pretext to demand the premiums. But that

• fact does not appear, and is not made an idgre-, dient in the case. Mr. Selwyn, in referring to . the cases of Mitchell v. Cockbume, Sullivan v.

Greaves, and Booth v. Hodgson, says, that it appears to have been the opinion of two eminent [judges, (Eyre, C. J. and Lord Kenyon,) in those cases, that when a single name appears upon the policy, the insurer will not be allowed, if a loss ' happening to dafeat a bona fide insurance, by al• leging to an innocent person that there was a secret partnership between himself and another.

• To be sure, it would be the height of injustice if the law were otherwise—and the fair question upon the statement of Brunton v. Taddy is, whe’ ther one of these innocents, who would have had a legal claim to indemnity in case of loss, was justified, (not in common honesty, for that in . these matters is out of the question, but in point of law,) to refuse paying the stipulated price for an engagement which the law would have enabled - him to support. The foundation of the judgment is that the policy was yoid, but, according to the dicta referred to, it was not void; and the policy of the law might have been abundantly satisfied, by hald-ingthat there was a legal contract, giving a legal, claim for the payment of the premium, and leav- tug the illegal and collateral contract of partner-j ship to the consequences of its own inefficacy.

In Watts v. Brooks, 3 Ves* 612. there htd been a contract of partnership in insurance, be• tween the plaintiff and defendant, as well upon ships and cargoes as upon lives; and upon a ge• nerd bill for an account, the Lord Chancellor t (Loughborough^ said, that though he waa of opinion that the judgment of the Court of King’s Bench, in Booth and Hodgson, was right, it went

no farther than that the Court would not enforce

• those.contracts; but where the patties had had dealings together upon a variety of transactions,

and lames had been incurred and paid, and a

• general account, was sought, he did not execute . the contract against law, but be should do injustice if he did not give the advantage, if any advantage had arisen, or charge any loss.whamjhqd happened. If it waa a smuggling business, and they had been settling profit and loss upon smuggling transactions, he should do great injustice if he did not bring that into account. So upon stock transactions, though the Court would not execute the contract, yet where the parties had been settling stock dealings and paying deferences, he must bring these into account.* Lord Eldon, in Aubert v, Mare, says, with referents to the preceding case of Watts v. Brooks that sc may be observed, that it is possible that where parties have settled the balance of a mixed account between them, of long Handing, and ose party has had an advantage for many yean of credit being given to him for certain sums therein* a court of equity may feel itself called upon to

3Jen the whole account, if the patty, wn6 fes ready taken credit for those sums, should think proper to object to an account being taken of the residue. But if that was to be considered as a case in which it was drily' decided, that a master, in the course of taking an account, found certain sums paid on account of any of these illegal transactions, be may, on the ground of consent to suth payment, view them in the same light as- tfta other items of the account, it did not appear to him, that the case proceeds upon a principle sufficiently consistent with the Act of Parliament to justify the adoption of it. And in Knewlea v* Haughton, 11 Yes. 168. an account of partnership transactions, so far as related to insurance, was refused—and the Master of* the Hells said, ho had always found it difficult to reconcile the dfc-tinction, in Watts v. Brooks, to his mind *

If the consent, which is referred to in fee above observations, is merely the general consent resulting from the illicit partnership, I think it will' be impossible to contest, with any regard $o legal principles, the justness of the observation* respecting it. But if there is an express and immediate subsequent consent to take such payments into account, the questions will, perhaps* in some degree, depend upon the adoption or rejection of the great principle in FYikney «v Bey-nons—although, in Edgar v, Fowler, 2 East. 222-It was held, that the mere stateasent often account was not equivalent to the payment of the money, so as to give effect to an illegal contract

(2.) Having In a preceding Note adverted to die caaea decided with respect to the construction of the clause giving to the chartered companies the exclusive privilege of insuring by a common fond, 1 shall here take the liberty of expressing the sentiment which I have long entertained, that few provisions in the Statute Book are attended with more injurious and detrimental consequences, with relation to the subject to which they are applied, than the present. It is not probable, that m the present times any such views of public policy, as are expressed in the preamble of the statute, would have much influence in opposition to the known advantages of freedom of competition; and it is manifest, that even at the time of passing the Act, the assistance rendered to the Civil List was an argument of much greater efficacy than the expectation. of any beneficial consequences to the public from the nature of the regulation; but in the general state of alarm and confusion, arising from the bursting of the South Sea Bubble, questions of general policy were not likely to be examined with a very calm and settled attention, and from the pernicious consequences that had resulted from an excessive confidence in bold and impudent projects, an error on the tide of excessive caution would not be scrutinised with much severity.

To the right acquired by law in the existing companies, that sacred respect is due which should prevent the slightest encroachment for tke sake of a general benefit to the public, without afford* ing a full and liberal compensation. In estimating the extent of such compensation, regard is to be had to the present extent of insurance effected by the companies, the avenge profit arising thereon for a reasonable and adequate length of time, and the probable diminution of such profit by admitting a competition which the Act at present ex-dudes, with such a preponderance in favour of the companies as would preclude the reasonable apprehension of error and injustice. The fund for answering such compensation would, I con.

ceive, be easily found in an adequate charge upon private policies.

The advantage to be expected from such a change would arise from a competition for a character of fairness and integrity, as is folly evinced in the instance of the several' Societies for Insurance from Fire and on Lives, and the reasonable preference which is at present given to the known principles that regulate the practice of the chartered Companies; whereas to any person who looks with attention at the judicial proceedings of the country, it is obvious, that in no one department of the law (with the tingle exception of cases founded on the Annuity Act) is there ex* hibited so extended a practice of chicanery and dishonesty as in the objections taken to the validity of policies of insurance.

The original purpose of that contract, as affording an indemnity against inevitable accidents* is> evidently of the most beneficial tendency; and the advantage resulting from it, notwithstanding all the subtractions arising from an unfair spirit of resistance, are of very great magnitude and importance; but after the compensation for the indemnity is paid, and the loss which has been contemplated has occurred, without the slightest imputation of unfairness or misconduct, the general course of proceeding appears to be to examine, whether, by any means, the law will afford in opportunity of evading the performance of the engagements that have been deliberately entered Into; and a person who would be hooted out of Gangway's, if insisting upon the strict protection of the law upon a contract for the transfer of stock, will strut across to Lloyd's, with all the confidence of an honest man, while sheltering himself under the protection of the most strict and technical objection to the policy of insurance.

The entering into contracts, in direct and wilful derogation of the law, is s proceeding' which I have no wish to commend or apologise for; but there are many instances in which the rules of law, for very adequate reasons, may withhold re *

4 XVIII. And whereas it is notorious that several undertakings' or

* projects of different kinds have at some time or times since the four- ana-twentieth day of June one thousand seven hundred and eighteen been publickly contrived and practised, or attempted to be practised within the city of London ana other parts of this kingdom, as also in

* Ireland and other his Majesty’s dominions, which manifestly tend to the

4 common grievance prejudice and inconvenience of great numbers of your Majesty's subjects in their trade or commerce and other their

publick subscriptions and draw In many unwary persons t 4 subscribe therein towards raising great sums of money, whereupon the subscribers or claimants under them do pay small proportions thereof, and such proportions in the whole do amount to very large sums; 4 which dangerous and mischievous undertakings or projects do relate to several fisheries aifd other affairs wherein the trade commerce and wek fare of your Majesty’s subjects, or great numbers of them, are concerned or interested: And whereas in many cases the said undertakers or subscribers have, since the said four-and- twentieth day of June one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, presumed to act as if they were cor-c porale bodies and have pretended to make their shares in stocks transdr ew for the enforcing a contract which it would be a violation of the plainest and simplest principles of common integrity to evade; and of this the illustrations, arising from the subject before us, are unfortunately too numerous and manifest.

The following observation of Lord Loughs borough, in deciding upon the invalidity of a contract' ef another nature, is sufficiently indicative of the grand principle which it is desirable to inculcate—" This agreement, resting on private contract and honour, may perhaps be fit to be executed by the parties, but can only be enforced by considerations which apply to their feelings, end is not the subject of an action. The law encourages no man to be unfaithful to his promise, but legal obligations are, from their nature, more circumscribed than moral duties M—Parsons v. Thompson, 1 H. Bla. 327.

Without entering into a long enumeration of cases in support of the observations which I have made respecting policies of insurance, or intending to cast reflection! on particular individuals, who, in defending themselves against particular claims, and who have only acted according to the general system which 1 am endeavouring to counteract, 1 am induced to refer to a case in which it was (Ejected with success that the insurance could not be recovered on a vessel warranted neutral, and lost by the perils of the seas, because, for a small part of the voyage, a proper document for attesting such neutrality was not on board, but in which case 1 well remember that it was observed by one of the judges who concurred in the decision, that he remembered the times where an underwriter would have been ashamed to have insisted upon such an objection. The cases in which the liability upon an insurance at andjrom Canton was objected to, because the being at Canton was an infraction of the charter of the East India Company—a more recent case in which the objection was taken from the forgotten and baadoned charter of the South Sea Company—

the cases of objections from an inaccuracy In respect of the complicated provisions of the Re« gister Acts, wholly unconnected with the loss incurred, are all instances of that spirit of resistance to fair and reasonable claims which, 1 conceive, would be moat materially diminished by the removal of the existing restrictions upon insuring by a common fund, and by admitting that competition which would exdte an interest in acquiring the character as attached to known respectable bodies for a fair performance of the engagements that are entered into according to their real purpose and intention as opposed to the existing and too powerful interest of looking foe a defence in the intricacies and subtleties of the law.

1 have, in conversation, heard it offered arm defence against the habit of insurers to insist upon minute and technical objections, that they are exposed to numerous frauds which they are unable to detect or prove, and that therefore the insisting upon legal advantages in their favour i» only an adequate means of security and defence; but I apprehend that it will not require any particular strength of reasoning to prove, that to commit a fraud upon ooe person is not the proper means of obtaining security" or indemnity against the fraud committed by another.

Besides the objections already mentioned to the existing monopoly, there is another of very considerable importance, in the necessity which it imposes upon the assured of incurring the expence of a separate action upon every separate subscrip, tion to the policy. The Insurers nave an opportunity, by means of the well-known practice of the consolidation rule, to unite in one common defence, but, by declining to take that course, they have the opportunity of harassing the assured with an accumulation of expence, in many cases exceeding the amount of the indemnity which lie suet for.

Rips 1361. 2 Str. 472. it waa ruled, that the Court were not obliged to give the whole judgment a* in case of a praemunire, but only soda port aa in their die* peedon they should think fit, and they adjudged the defendant to pey; a fine of 5/ - and to ho in* prisoned during the King’s pleasure. Tine case, which eeeurred twe years-after the passing of the Act, was only brought before the Courts until the King ». Dodd, 9 Sot. 516* in which the Court dfrlmod to pant an information agaimt the defendant for circuiting schemes for a paper manufactory and a distillery, by which, luge capitals were to be. raised in small trahafemhle shares, thorn haring been a lapee of 87 years since any authenticated proceeding had been taken on this branch of the Act; but they do* dined giving any opinion how far the case, aa ntated, came witlan Urn Act, as the point might still arise upon indictment or information by the Attorney-General.

In Buck v. Buck, 1 Gamp. N. P - 547. tbs plaintiff haring employed the defendant to pur-ebaao fare share* in a concern not incorporated, oiled the Britnh Ale Brewery, and the defendant haring only paid one half of the amount, which he had received and charged, it was ruled by Sir

I. .Mansfield, C. J. that the plaintiff, on account of the illegality of the concern, could not recorer money which was so improperly retained, and a nonsuit was accordingly directed, with leave to move the Court to enter a verdict in the plain* tiff’s favour, but tbs case was-not brought before the Court. The decision certainly went a very great length, however dearly the so^aty aright

be brought within the Act, when it was held, that the mere carrier of a sum of money intended to be applied in purchasing a share of the concern, was entitled to purloin the money with which he waa so intrusted. In Rex «• Stratton, n. t6t£ Lord Elknborough held, that an Indictment could not be sustained for conspiring to deprive a person of the office of Secretary of the Philantrophic Annuity Society, and to prosecute him for oh-tearing money by false pretence, the Association appearing to be an unincotporated Company with transfenrable shares.

The subject came into more direct disci isainti in Rex* Webbaed others, 14 Eon. 406. which wax an indictment again* the defendants founded upon rile Act far subscribing to form a- Society, celled the Birmingham Bread and Flour Society: it appearing by special verdict, that ths defendants with others, being inhabitants of Birmingham, mutually agreed to be co-partnen in making bread, do with a capital of jC2M0Q, w he divided into shares—no person, to hold

XX. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any merchant or trader at any time after the said, fbur-and-twendeth day of June one thousand seven hundred and twenty, shall suffer any particular damage in his her or their trade commerce or other lawful affairs, by occasion or means of any undertaking or attempt matter or thing by this How Merchants Act declared to be unlawful as aforesaid, ana will sue to be relieved or Traden may therein, then and in every such case such merchant or trader shall and have their Re- may have his and their remedy for the same by an action or actions to be medy again* grounded upon this statute, against the persons societies or partnerships the Under- or any of them who contrary to this Act shall be engaged or interested

was prejudicial to the bakers and millers of the town and neighbourhood in their respective trades; and it was ruled, that the indictment could not be maintained. Lord EJlenborough, in delivering the opinion of the Court, took a very full and elaborate view of this part of the Act, in the course of which he observed, that what was described aa illegal might be divided into two rinses First, the undertakings described in the preamble, especially those in which the parties pretend to act as a body corporate, or to have tnnsfemble stock—and, Secondly, all other undertakings tending to the common grievance, Ac. c. of the King’s subjects, or a great number of them, in their trade, commerce, or other lawful affairs. Upon the view taken of the Statute, he said, the Court thought it impossible to aay that it makes a substantive offence to raise a large capital by small subscriptions, without any regard to the nature and quality of the objects for which the capital was raised, or whatever might be the purposes to which it was to be applied. The recital of the Act referred to tuck dangerous and mischievous undertakings as manifestly tend to the common grievance, Ac. c.—the enacting part, sec. 18. to subscriptions for tuck undertakings, vis. such as are mentioned in the preamble—the enacting part, sec. 19. to unlawful undertakings and attempts so tending to the common grievance, Ac. c. and to making subscriptions for that purpose. It is therefore, ' he said, only where the subscription is with reference to undertakings, Ac. c. which the Act prohibits, that it is illegal—the Act does not apply indiscriminately to all subscriptions. The purpose being in this case expressly found to be beneficial, the only remaining question is, whether, as the shares are to the extent pointed out tnnsfemble, the defendants have offended in respect of having raised such a description of transferable stock ? It may admit of doubt, whether the mere raising transferable stock is in any case per so an offence against the Act, unless ft has relation to some undertaking or project which has a tendency to the common grievance, prejudice, or inconvenience of his Majesty's subjects, or of great numbers of them ? The mischief intended to be remedied arose from stick undertakings and projects, and the suppression of such undertakings and projects seems to be the gnat object of the Act. But without entering particularly Into that point, it may be sufficient to say here, that, in the qualified extent to which these shares are tnnsfemble, it cannot be said that there has been suck a raising of transferable tock at to fell clearly within the scope of the

Act. He then particularly adverted to its not being the object of the undertaking to raise stock for the purpose of transfer, as a commercial speculation—to the limited number of shares which any individual was allowed to hold—and to the necessity of entering into a covenant to take a certain quantity of bread or Hour weekly, as circumstances shewing the case not to be within the operation of the Act, and judgment was accordingly given for the defendants.

In Pratt r. Hutchinson, 15 East. 511. the action was brought on a bond given to the Treasurer of a Building Society, the members of which were to subscribe monthly sums for building houses, to be taken by the subscribe r*in succession, by lor, such subscribers entering into a bond for the payment of their future contributions. It was pleaded aa sufficient to bring the case within the Statute, that, according to the rules, every member should have power to sell his share, provided the purchaser should become a paity to the articles; and that no person should be permitted to purchase until he bad been fit* proposed and approved at a meeting of the Society; and that certain tradesmen named should be' employed, and no others. The Court called upon the defendant's counsel to state upon what ground k could be contended, that the shares were transferable within the‘meaning of the Statute, where the holder had not the power of transferring, except upon the condition of the purchaser being approved. It being urged, that in the preceding case the nuisance was negatived by the special finding of the jury, Bailey, J. observed, that the plea did not allege generally as a question for the jury, that the Society was prejudicial to the public at large, and therefore, unless it be brought within the Statute, it is no answer. An objection being taken on account of the stipulation of employing particular tradesmen. Lord Ellenborough said, the combination mu* be for some illegal object, but there is nothing illegal in stipulating to employ particular persona only in the building, and the Court decided, that there vu no pretence for the objection made upon the Statute.

In Carien v, Drury, 1 V. A B. 154. a question arose as to the legality of a partnership in a Brewery of 1600 shares, to be under the directions of managers and a committee. The Lord Chancellor declined entering into the question, whether the partnership fell within the terms of the Act; and decided the case upon a collateral ground, applicable to a partnership to which there was no leg* objection.

(4.) The inserting this proviso is a striking instance of superfluous caution, and affords a illustration of the weakness of the ind-arguments which are sometimes deduced ffom particular saving chases, as limiting die operation of the general purview of the Statute. It is impoariUe that any Court could have held it necessary to insert e saving clause, in favour of the establishments erected by the very Act which contains the general prohibition.

(5.) An idea is sometimes entertained, that partnerships, in general, consisting of more than six persons, are illegal; but the only prohibition upon the subject Is that contained in Statute 6 Anne, c. 38. sec. 9. and subsequent Statutes, which prohibit, during the continuance of the Charter of the Bank of England, partnerships of more than six persons taking up money upon their notes, payable on demand ia less than n moutfrl from the time of borrowing.

But that although an insurance, strictly and accurately speaking, seems to relate to positive loss, merely in opposition to expected profit, yet thb distinction b not generally attended to The failure of an advantage of which we have formed a strong expectation does not appear very dMuim from actual damage sustained. Between s wager, therefore, and an insurance, the material dtfhrence seems to be, the assured haring a pecu-Bdary mrerem in ths subject. He further observes, that by the ordinances of almost all the commercial mates in Europe, wagers, upon mercantile adventure, are totally prohibited. Ne support b given in any extent whmever to a gaming contract. If it be executed in the form of an insurance, and every insurance upon expected profit, in opposition to positive loss, b mentioned in s very unfavourable point of view.

The French regulation prohibits the owner and master of ships purchasing insurance on their freight, or merchants on the expected profits of their good* By the ordinance orConmgsberg, all insurances on expected gain of future freight monies, securing wagers, are irrevocably forbid. In Britain, ideas lemstrict have been entertained: in particular, the distinction between an insurance against positive loss and upon expected profit b totally overlooked.

In Grant v. Parkinson, Park, c. 14. p. 269. 2 ed. 1 Marshall, 111. an insurance was sustained on goods valued at 10001. being profits expected to •rise on the cargo, in the event of its arriving at Quebec. It appeared, that the insurance was on the profits expected to arise on a cargo of Mo-lames belonging to the plaintiff, who had a contract to supply the army with spruce beer. In

Flint, «. he Mesurier, 1796, Park, c. 14. Lord Kenyon expremed a strong opinion in favour of an insurance, declared by the policy to be on commbsion, as consignee of the cargo. In Sunday e. Cousins, 2 East. 545. an insurance was held on profits valued at, on in African voyage

it being averred, that plaintiff was interested in the profits to arise from the sale and dbpoml of the cargo. A very elaborate judgment, among a general view of the law upon the subject, mm given by Lawrence, J.—end see Hennckaou «. Maigetaon, *. ibid, where the policy was declared to be on imaginary profits. In Eyre *. Glover, 16 East. 218. the insurance was on Proffa, without further descriprion, snd held good.

ship was captured by captains acting in the service of their country, and upon whose conduct there it not the smallest imputation: they had the pot-lead on of the property insured, and from that possession certain rights and duties resulted. If it were a legal capture, the captors were entitled; if the capture were improperly made, they were liable to be called to an account in the Court of Admiralty, where they might be amerced in damages and cotta. It was important to them, that there should be something forthcoming to answer for the amount of those damages." Lawrence, J.— " The case stands on this short question, whether or not the aanxred had an interest which they might insure ? Did they mean to game ? Or, was not there a lorn against which they might indemnify themselves by a policy of insurance ? 1 do not mean a certain, but a possible lass. Now it has been shewn, that the Court of Admiralty might have decreed damages and costs, and that is sufficient." Some doubts having been thrown on this subject, in the discussion in the House of Lords of the case of Lucena and Crawford, infra, it was holden, in Sterling v. Vaughan, 11 East. 619. that an insurance might be made of a prise taken by the conjoined forces of the army and navy, by an agent appointed to act on behalf of all interested in the capture; and by Lend Ellenborough, 44 By the Act of 45 Geo. III. c. 72. the Crown gives up its rights in the prise to the captors, subject, however, aa before, to the final adjudication of the property as prise. But it is said, that the Crown may. still release the prise to the captured before condemnation. But that right of the Crown trenches no more upon the insurable interest of the captors, than upon that of the King himself. It is then objected, that the property in the prise may never become vested in the captors. It is vested, however, as far as the Crown has any right to vest it, defeasible no doubt by an adjudication of the Court of Admiralty; but is it not in common experience, that a defeasible interest is insurable? It it the case of every consignee of goods under a bill of lading; they may be stopped in iranptu, and his interest defeated; the captors have the actual possession of the grant of the King, the only person in the kingdom who could contest it with theip. They have the possession, with a. partial right of disposing of the thing immediately. This is not the insuring a mere expectation, like the case of the Dutch Commissioners, tn/ro. But these tapton bad a present pooesaion, and a right to maintafottaspaas against any person attempting to take the prise from them. Even with reaped to captors in general, supposing the prise not to have been acquired tortlously, but jura belli, 1 should think, that in respect of their possession and special property they might insure, but it is Vol. II.

not necessary to deckle that general point, because here the captors had a more perfect right, a right of property, so for as the Crown had a power of granting it, liable only to be dispossessed by the release of the Crown before condemnation, or by sentence of restoration." The other judges expressed themselves to the same effect. With respect to the argument founded upon the King’s power to release, Bailey, J. said, 44 The foith of the Crown is pledged to proceed to condemnation, and not to release the prise, except under special circumstances involving the interest of the public; the King can take nothing for himself, nor give it to any third persons.

But in Routh o. Thompson, 11 East. 428. an armed ship having captured and taken into Lisbon a Danish vessel, after a proclamation reauiring the bringing such vessels into port, and having taken a freight to England, with which the vessel captured sailed on the day of issuing of letters of marque, it was ruled, that an insurance made on behalf of the captors could not be sustained. Lord Ellenborough on delivering the judgment of the court said, M The right had been put upon two grounds—first, that they had a well grounded expectation, warranted by the practice of the Crown in similar cases, that the ship and freight, had there been no lorn, would have been granted to them—and secondly, that they had the lawful possession, and were liible, either to the Crown or the foreign owner, for the safe custody of the vessel. Aa to the first, they had no vestedright they could demand nothing of the Crown. Had the Crown made the grant In their favour, it would have been altogether ex gratid—a mere boon and gift. That gift might have been of the whole, or it might have been of part, and of a very inconsiderable part only. The bounty of the Crown would probably have been in proportion to the merit of the detention and capture, and the value of the prise. Had the ship arrived, the captors would have had a chance of a grant from the Crown; but can they in respect of that chance insure the ship's arrival, and supposing such a chance insurable, must it not be insured specifically as such chance ? must not the interest be so described in the policy ? can a man who has no right, legal or equitable, either in a ship or freight, ' effoct an insurance on‘either, merely because he has a chance that some collateral benefit may arise to him, if the ship and cargo should arrive in safety ? His Lordship referred to the passage above cited from Le Cras and Hughes, and the doubts thrown thereon by Lord Eldon, in Lucena v. Crawford, post; but, supposing the authority of that case were unquestionable upon both the points decided, held that h would afford no rule to govern a case like the present. With regard to

the second point in the principal case, it was held, that tha captors were not entitled to recover on the ground of posroroioa-—that it was a lawful poasriwon, but they were' not responsible for the ship's safety—that the Crown could not call upon them for damages, and they could have no right to ask for an indemnity, when they had not been, and (under the circumstances stated) could not have been damnified." The case was stated in such a manner as to exdude the question, whether the insurance might have been supported as made on behalf of the Crown.

Very considerable discussion respecting the nature of insurable interest, took place in respect of insurances effected by the commiuiortew upon Dutch prqperty, ta the year 1795. By 35 Geo. III. c. 80, % 21, die King was empowered to grant commissions to three or more persons, authorising them to take the ships and cargoes, belonging to the United Pro/inces, into their possession and under their care, and to manage sell and dispose of the sane to the best advantage, according to such instructions as they should receive. In Crawford Sc al. v. Hunter. 8 T. R. 13, the declaration stated a commission issued to the plaintiff* by virtue of the Act, that certain ships, Ac. c. were seised a sea by his Majesty's sailors, upon which the plaintiffs, being such commissioners, caused an insurance to be made from St. Helena to London, that if the King's ships arrived in London, the plaintiffs would have been authorized to take them under their care, &c—that they were interested to the amount insured—and that the insurance was made for their use, as such commissioners. Another count was upon the Interest of the King, averring the insurance to be made on his behalf—and a third count, not averring any interest, alleged, that the shins were not belonging to his Majesty or any of nis subjects; upon which the question arose, whether interest ought to have teen averred, as has since teen held necessary, in' the case of Cousins v. Nantes, (see the last note.) Upon demurrer, it was ruled, upon the first count, that the commissioners had such an interest as enabled them to insure. The subject came more fully Into consideration, in Lucent v. Cnwfurd (in error) 3 B. St P. 75, and in Dorn. Proc. 2 N. R. 313. The counts were similar to those in the preceding case—and Lord Kenyon having given an opinion, that the first count was sufficiently, proved, directed the jury to find accordingly.—A bill of exceptions was tendered.—On the other counts a verdict was found for the defendant. The only facts necessary to be adverted to are the order to ships to seise and bring in ships of the United States, dated in February—the commission to the defendants, dated the 19th June—the sending in from

the East Indies. See 5 Bur. 1394.

St. Helena in July—the loro «f some of the Veroeb previous to the 15ch September—due, on the 15th September, genual letaros of marque were issued against the United States, subsequent to winch the loro took place of another of the vtweh, (the Zeeklye) — and that, on the 10th October, s nranmiroirei issued to the Court of Admiralty to proceed to the adjudication of such dupe, of which pries fine had been or should be taken by the commi—innrra, reserving to the cornmiawonari the sole dispowticu and management thereof. In the Eadieqocr Chamber, the judges were (except Chambre, J.) of opinion, that the plaintiff had an iutnraMo interest as trustees under the commiwif, which was not varied by the subsequent declaration of hostilities and the new commission iroued thereon. The judgment being affirmed, upon appeal to dm House of Lords, the nature of insurable interests was very fully examined, both in the printed ernes and in toe opinion of the Judges. Several important questions were put to the Judges, which, with their answers, fully appear in die report. Upon the question, whether the plaintiff* had an insurable interest, Graham, B. Le Blanc; J. Rooke, J. Grose, J.Heath, J. Me. Donald, C.B. and Mansfield, C. J. concurred in the affirmative as to all the ships, and Thomson as to all except the Zeelelye—the loro of which did not happen till after the Proclamation of Reprisals. Cham-tee, J. and Lawrence, J. answereain die negative, principally on the ground, that the comnusskm was only to take care of the property after its arrival in England; and that, if till then they had not any power to interfere with it, they coukl not he said, at the time of the sailing and loss, to have been interested. The following extract, from the opinion of Lawrence, J. stems to throw a very considerable light on the general question as to the nature of insurable interests:—•‘That a man must somehow or other be interested in the preservation of the subject matter exposed to pails, follows from the nature of the contract, when not used as a wager, but ae applicable to the purposes for which it was originally introduced; but to confine it to the protection of the interest which arises out of property, is adding a restriction to the contract which does not arise out of its nature.

A man is interested in a thing, to whom advantage may arise or prejudice happen, from the circumstances which may attend it, in quantum roes interfuit, i.e. quantum sticks abest qiumtumque lucrari potui—Dig, lib. 46, tfc' 8, L 13; and whence it importeth, that its condition, as to safety or other quality, should continue. Interest does not necessarily imply s right to the whole or a part of the thing, nor necessarily and exclusively that which may be the subject of privation, but

Q p, . his agents or assigns who alone shall have a right to make assurance on 19 ll# the money so lent; and no borrower of money on bottom-ree or at re- c* spondentia as aforesaid shall recover more on any assurance than the valud of his interest on the ship, or in the merchandizes or effects laden on board of such ship, exclusive of the money so borrowed; and in case

the having some relation to or concern in the subject of the insurance, which relation or concern, by the happening of the perils insured against, may be so affected as to produce a damage, detriment, or prejudice to the person insuring; and where a man is so circumstanced, with respect to matters exposed to certain risks or dangers, as to have a moral certainty of advantage or benefit, but for those risks or dangers, he may be said to be interested in the safety of the thing. To be interested in the preservation of a thing is to be so circumstanced, with respect to it, as to have benefit from its existence, or prejudice from its destruction. The property of a thing, and the interest derivable from it, may be very different; of the first, the price is generally the measure— but by interest in a thing, every benefit and advantage arising out of or depending upon such thing, may be considered as comprehended.’' All the Judges agreed, that the question could not be considered as a policy on the profits which the commissioner! were to receive from their employment, being declared upon as a policy upon the plaintiff's interest in the ships. Lord Eldon took a very full view of the circumstances of the particular case, and said, that jf he were bound then to state hit opinion judicially, he should be obliged very strongly to say, that the claims of the plaintiffs could not be supported; but mid, he was sure it could not be supported as to the Zee-lelye, which he thought the plaintiffs could not have taken into their potsetsion as commissioners, although the King, after the declaration of hostilities, had made them his agents; and, as entire damages had been given, he suggested, that k would be proper to award a ventre d§ were, that the whole record would be then carried down, and the case would be open, and all the different interests which were averred in the other counts. Lord Ellenborough and the Lord Chancellor (Er-akine) concurring in this view of the subject, ' a venirt d* \ novo was awarded accordingly $ and, in Cousins v. Nantes, 3 Taunt. 515. the Court declared, that the only question in Lucent «. Craw- furd was, whether the decision of the Court, which was worded in a particular way, contained such an averment- of interest as would support the judgment of the Court below- Upon the seeded trial of Lucent©. Cnwfiixd, e verdict was found for the plaintiff, on the count alleging an interest in the Crown. A bill of exceptions was tendered to Lord Ellenborough*! direction, as to the Crown having a sufficient interest, and also as to the insurance being made on behalf of, or adopted by the Crown; hot the judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed in the House of Loads, 1 Taunt. 335. In a second case of Routh w Thompson, 13 East. 274. it was ruled, that the Crown had an insurable interest in Danish vessels, seized under an Or.der of Council, made previous to the commencement of hostilities. As to the adoption of such insurance, ride port.

Before quitting this case, I think it not wholly irrelevant to advert to the opinions expressed with regard to the conduct, of the underwriters in resitting the demand, as affording some confirmation of the remarks made in a former Number of the want of fairness, which is frequently manifested in resisting demands upon policies of insurance upon strictly legal objections. Lord Kenyon, in Crawford v. Hunter—" The underwriters, knowing what kind of interest the plaintiffs had in the property, took the premium, considering them ea having a right to make the insurance, and, when the low happened, they refined to pay what they had engaged to pay, pretending that the pkmtift had no right to make the insurance. Uncon-acientioua, however, as the objection made by the defendant may be, if it be a legal objection, lie baa a right to insist upon it in a court of law.’* Cham-Twe, J. in Lucena v. Crawfttrd—" So far aa respects the parties in dispute, 1 certainly shall not regret that my opinion is overruled, as 1 dd not see upon what honourable principle the performance of the contract is resisted by the defendants who have not been deceived, but have made their contract with full knowledge of all the circumstances of the case." Lord Eldon—* With respect to the conduct of the underwriters I have said nothing. Courts of justice have no right to tell men whether they have acted honeady or dishonestly. It is the duty of a court to say whether they have acted legally. To that consideration 1 have entirely confined myself." I should not have thought it requisite to have cited these observations if they only bore upon the conduct of the individual underwriters in this particular case. But numerous as the subscriptions to the policies in question must have been, the importance of the consideration arises from what may be regarded (so fir as appears from the cases that come before the pnbKc) a systematic principle of conduct which is allowed to operate to ao great an extent, without the fear of censure or reproach, in opposition to the plain and obvious dictates of justice and integrity.

It was admitted in the diacusrion of Lucena r. Cnwfiurd, that a mere expectation, without interest, such as that of the next of kin of a lunatic, cannot be the subject of insurance.

The following cases have occurred with respect to the degree and kind of interest which are requisite when the subject is in its nature insurable. Hibbert ft. Carter, 1 T. R. 745. The person on whose behalf the insurance was mede, had, after the consignment and before the insurance, indented the bill of lading to a person to whom he owed an arrear of interest. This was at first con-K 2

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in all 19 actions or suits brought or commenced after the said first day of August c* 37. by the assured upon any policy of assurance, the plaintiff in such action or suit, or his attorney or agent, shall within fifteen days after he or they in ajj Action! shall be required so to do in writing by the defendant, or his attorney or Plaintiff ro deagent, declare in writing what sum or sums he hath assured or caused to dare within be assured in the whole, and what sums he hath borrowed at respondentia fifteen days or bottom-ree for the voyage or any part of the voyage in question in such what Suma he suit or action. hath mured.

bear Company, who repudiated the consignment, whereupon phuntiffs effected the insurance without any order to do so, and immediately Wrote to advise Lund thereof, who returned an answer, expressing his approbation; and tt was ruled, that this was a sufficient agency, and also that it satisfied the description of the plaintiffs as persons receiving the order to insure within Stat. 28 Geo. III.; and per Buffer, J.—u It is agreed, that a genera] agent has a right to exercise his discretion for the benefit of his prindpal, he must act upon the spur of the occasion, and if nothing else had passed, I have doubts whether the consignor would not have been liable to pay the premium *, But the plaintiffs take the opportunity to inform the consignor of their having made their insurance, and he highly approves of their acts, which bring the case within the maxim that amnia ratihabitio mandate equipara-tur." In the second case of Lucena t>. Crawfurd,

I Ttunt. 325, a letter to the Dutch Commissioners from the Secretary of the Treasury, by order of the Board, on the same day on which the insurance was effected, intimating their opinion that it would be prudent to insure, and dashing them to take the necessary steps accordingly, was contended not to be sufficient to shew an authority to make the insurance in the name or on the behalf of the Crown, or as a ratification of such insurance; but the judgment for the original plaintiffs (the defendants in error) was affirmed without calling upon them to answer the objections. In Stirling v. Vaughan,

II East. filS, (decided upon another point already mentioned,) upon its being said, that the insurance made by the direction of the captors for the benefit of all concerned, might be considered as made under an implied authority to insure for the Crown. Lord Ellenborough mid,

" The law will presume, if nothing appear vn the contrary, that every person accepts that which is for their benefit. And here it is for the benefit of the Crown to preserve the prise, if it were only for the purpose of securing to the captors Che reward which its bounty provided for them in the event of condemnation.

Upon a serood case of Routh «. Thompson, respecting Danish vessels seised by virtue of an Order of Council, the prise agent having directed an insurance directing the plaintiff to do the best for the concerned, it having been ruled, that the Crown had an insurable interest in the subject, it was further held; that an Order of Council, subsequent to the lose, adopting and approving of

the insurance, and authorising the assured to sue for his Majesty’s use, was sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover—13 East. 274.

In Hagedorn «. Oliverson, 2 M. & . 485, the plaintiff who was employed to obtain a license for a ship to proceed with a cargo from certain limits to Great Britain, effected, without any directions, an insurance on the ship on behalf of all such persona to whom the same ipight belong. The only evidence of a recognition of his authority to make s ich insurance was a letter from the owner two years after the lost, expressing a hope that he had settled with the underwriters, and this was held sufficient. Lord Ellenborough said, that the plaintiff had a right to effect an insurance on the chance of its being adopted for the benefit of all those to whom it might appertain, which are the words of the policy. He might insure for those who were actually interested, and possibly for thoae who might be interested. The owner was interested, and might become privy to the benefit of the insurance by subsequent adoption. He had adopted it, and it is made a question whether he can become privy to the benefit of it. It appears, to me, upon the authorities of Lucena «. Craw-, find, and Routh v. Thompson, that he may. The other Judges expressed their opinions to the same. effect.

It is settled that a valued policy is not objectionable, although the value stipulated may exceed the amount of actual interest, provided the valuation it not a mere cover for a wager, as (to use the expression of Lord Mansfield), if a person who insures for j£2000 has interest only to the value of a cable—see the subject foUy discussed in Lewis v. Rucker, 2 Bur. 1171. The valuation does not raise a mere presumption which mar be repelled by evidence, but the insurers are liable for the full amount in a case not amounting to a colourable wager, although they may prove an over valuation, —see Le Pypre v. Faaor, in Dorn. Proc. 253, —M*Nayr v. Coulter, Id. 255.

No inteiest can be averred, in a ship contrary to the provisions of the Register Acts—See Camden v. Anderson, 5 T. R. 509; but the Register alone is not sufficient proof of property or interest—Pine e. Andenoe, 4 Taunt. 652. An averment that two parties were interested is not disproved by evidence that previous to the insurance they had admitted t third—-Page v. Fit, 2 B. fit P. 40. But an averment that the policy was made for one joilit owner, and that

he was interested in the subject insured, cannot be sustained, if it appear that the policy was effected on the joint account of himself and the other owner—Ball v. Ansley, 16 G. 141.

In the first case of Routh v. Thompson, above stated, HE. 428, the Court, after deciding that the captors of a Danish ship, brought in under an Order of Council, had no insurable interest, held, that as there was no fraud in the captors in effecting the policy, as there was no illegality in the voyage or insurance, and as the resistance of the underwriters to the claims on the policy proceeded upon the ground that there was no risk,

the plaintiff was intitled to a return of his premium. As to return of premium on mere wager policies, see Lowry «. Bourdieu, Doug. 468.

(4.) This extends to re-assurance on foreign ships. The person effecting the re-asnusnee b not intitled to a return of premium, the Insurer having succeeded iu resisting the payments of a loss on account of the illegality of the contract— Audice v. Fletcher, 2 T. R. 161. A re-assurance differs from a double assurance, the farmer being effected by the insurer to transfer hb responsibility, the latter by the assured to incresse bb security.

In the first of these cases it was held, that the Act was sufficiently complied with, in a case where A consigned goods to B, drawing bills upon B in favour of C, the general agent of A, and transmitted the bills of lading to C, with directions to hand them over to B, that be might have an

opportunity to insure, and also drew a bill on C, which was accepted and paid: B having refilled to accept the bub or take to the cargo, C effected the insurance in hb own name, which he communicated to A, who expressed his approbation. For the animadversions of Buller, I. on the conduct of the underwriter, see not* 2, to No. 5, supra. In the later case it was held sufficient that the broker for the plaintiff, who effected the policy, was therein called agent, without stating

for whom; and in De VJgnier v. Swifttaon, n.bid, it was held to be sufficient, that the penmu effecting the policy were averred In the declaration to be agents, not being described as such in the policy. Where the plain tiff, whose name was on the policy, end who gave the order to insure, did so without authority, but the person on whose behalf the insurance was made afterwards ratified it, it was held sufficient, the plaintiff being the person who gave the order.—* mgedorn v. Oliver-eon, 2 M. fie . 485. But where the declaration averred, that the plaintiff received the order tot and effected the Insurance, It was held to be a material averment—and that a previous order must be shewn, and a subsequent adoption was not sufficient, although perhspe the declaration

1 i.Ws irir.i i nignaeg

might have been good without the averment.— Bell e, Johnson, 1 M. St 8. 201. In Mellish s. Bell, 16 R. 4, ift was ruled, that a declaration that the plaintiffi, M AN, caused a policy to be effected, averring that Mamie. John Gore ft Co. did make assurance, was good after verdict.

• Considering the utility of Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes, while applied to their proper and legitimate purposes on the one haud, and the mischief which frequently arises from the abuse of them on the other, there are few subjects in the compass of the liw which are of more extensive practical importance than the duly regulating these contracts, and the defining with accuracy and precision the several rights and obligations resulting from them. And, in relation to their peculiar transferable quality, I think it is highly desirable that their character and incidents should, as much as possible, appear upon the face of the instruments themselves, and not be affected by collateral inquiries, except so far as regards the particular individuals between whom the immediate transaction, which is the subject of inquiry, should have taken place; and, with this view, 1 have taken the liberty of suggesting the following legislative regulation:

I. In the first place, 1 thirik that the character of a Bill of Exchange, as distinguished from that of a Promissory Note, should be so distinctly marked, that there may be no hazard of misleading even those who may be ignorant or inattentive, by making the latter assume the semblance of the former. A deception upon this subject is often practised by inserting the name of some great commercial house on that part of the paper at which the name of a drawee of a Bill of Exchange is usually placed; and sometimes inserting and at other times omitting the word I before the direction to pay, and placing the word at generally in an indistinct manner above the name of the house at which the instrument professes to be payable; and many persons are deluded by taking these instruments as bills drawn upon such house, which is not the case when the word I is inserted. I apprehend that the law is not settled at to the character of the instrument when that word is omitted; and it seems desirable to enact, generally, that in all cases, when a sum of money is made payable to any person or persons or their order, or tr* the bearer, payable at the house sf mf other

person or persons named in such instrument, the same shall to all interns and purposes be taken in a bill of exchange, drawn upon the persons at whose house it is so made payable, unless the words pramue to pop shall he inserted in the body of such instrument.

2. In pursuance of the seme principles, 1 think it would be eligible to provide against ambiguity with respect to the acceptance of bills, and for that purpose to do away with all acceptances by pend or collateral undertaking; apd to provide that nothing be deemed an acceptance, except the word accepted he written on the instrument itself, saving to all partiea to whom a promise of acceptance may be made their right of action for the non-performance of such promise.

3. At the law at present stands, an action may be brought against the acceptor of a hill, or the holder of a note, without any previous presentment or demand of payment. This is founded upon the unmeaning maxim, that an action ia a demand—whereas, in the nature of the thing, a right of action supposes a previous default. When the obligation is in itself perfect and entire, — such as the discharge of a bill for goods sold, —it would be repugnant to hold, that any additional circumstance should be necessary to maintain an action for the non-performance of it; but the real nature of the undertaking of an acceptor of a bill is to pay the amount upon ha being presented; and great abuse may arise from allowing him to be arrested, and subjected to the coats of an action, for not discovering the accidental holder and paying the amount at bis peril. This would be obviated by the mere provision, that no action should be maintained against the acceptor of a bill, or the holder of a note, without a previous presentment and demand of payment.

4. 1 think that, with reference to the general interests of the community, the balance of convenience is greatly In favour of permitting the bolder of a bill, fairly received in the course of business, to enjoy the full benefit of it, according to ha apparent efficacy, without bring affected by

Class 1V.1 Bilk of Exchange and Promissory Notes. 251

the same. That from and after the four-and-twentieth day of Jane next

which shall be in the year one thousand six hundred ninety-eight, all and ULc* w• every bill or bills of exchange drawn in or dated at and from any trading city or town or any other place in the Kingdom of Englitnd dominion of Bills of Ex- Wales or town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, of the sum of hve pounds sterling change drawn in England, &c. of or upwards, payable at a certain Number of Days, dtc. sifter Acceptance and three Days after it is due, may be protested.

any collateral circumstances, such as gaming and usury in its original formation, or bankruptcy of the drawer or payee. Desirable as it may in hurt be, to prevent excess in gaming, —or as for the purpose of the argument it must be supposed to be to discountenance usury, or to assist the general creditors of a bankrupt, —it is infinitely more desirable, that no person shall be protected in practising a fraud on the public, by holding out, as a substantia! agreement, an undertaking which is of no legal efficacy. When the immediate attention of the legislator is confined to a particular object, such as the practice of gaming or usury, or the making provision for creditors, every other consideration becomes naturally subordinate to the principal design; but the true principle of legislation in this, as ip all other instances, requires an attentive examination of the general balance between opposite advantages and inconveniences; and the interests of justice will give the preponderance in favour of those who are wholly unconnected with the prohibited transaction, and would be subjected to loss and detriment, by giving credit without any imputation of negligence to the apparent obligation of a legal document, rather than of those who, however fully they may be intitled to protection against the parties with whom they have agreeably engaged, have been instrumental in obtaining credit to the apparent security. The protection of the law is given to the fair holder, in case of want of consideration, fraud or general illegality in the original structure of the bill, or in case of its having been subsequently lost or stolen, and there does not appear to be any adequate cause of public utility for making an exception in the particular cases at present adverted to The obligation should, however, be subject to recourse for repayment against those, who, if they had continued to be holders of the securities, would not have been allowed by the policy of the law to have made them available, on account of their own privity tp the illegal transaction, but have given efficacy to the instruments, and raised, by their transfer to otheisj an obligation which would not have subsisted in favour of themselves.

5. According to the nature and legal character of the contract, the engagement of the drawer and indorser of a Bill is to be accountable for the amount, in case of due presentment being made, and of due notice given, of the dishonour; and in case a contract was entered into, that in its terms expressed the condition, which by the nature of this engagement is implied, the performance of such condition would be a necessary preliminary to the right of action—and it would be no excuse to my, that the compliance with the

condition would have been attended with no advantage to the party insisting upon it. The Immediate reply would be non tuec in fctdera wnt. But by a series of judicial determinations such an exception has been extended to the esse of a drawer having no effects in the hands of the drawee—and in some instances, the exception has been extended to the indorser having notice that the instrument was of that kind which is popularly termed an accommodation transaction, although in others it has been held, that a person giving security, by indorsing a Bill, intended to enter into an engagement agreeably to the nature, of the instrument, and to stipulate for a compliance with the incidental requisites. In the first case upon the subject, Bickerdike e. Bolman, 1 T. R. 405. the Bill had not been accepted—and the case was put on the ground of the drawing such a Bill upon a person who had no effects, being a fraud; and I have heard Mr. Justice Chambre, who argued the case, express a doubt, whether the doctrine extended to Bills accepted—but no such doubt can be entertained as the law is now settled. Lord Eldon has observed, that the inconveniences, which had resulted from establishing the rule, could only be equalled by those of departing from it when established; meaning I conceive only to refer to the inconveniences of rescinding the existing practice by mere judicial authority, and not to those which would attach in respect of the nature of the subject, from an interposition of the legislature. There is, doubtless, much inconvenience from involving a contract, the advantage of which is in a great degree dependant upon its plainness and simplicity, in a perplexed inquiry as to accidental matters. The person who receives a Bill is aware, that the general validity of the obligation, against all parties except the accentor, depends upon his complying with the conditions attached to the nature of the contract, and neglects complying with those conditions, upon the mere hasard and speculation of being able, by accidental circumstances, to bring himself within the scope of the exception. An examination of the mere question of compliance or noncompliance with the rule is plain and obvious—the examination of the alleged exception, intricate and embarrassing; and I apprehend, that the general convenience would be best consulted by requiring a strict compliance with the legal requisites of the engagement.

6. Considering the necessity which sometimes prevails, with respect to the proper time forgiving notice of dishonour, I conceive that it would be most beneficial to lay down a certain and uniform rule, the compliance with which would in general be erf great facility—and perhaps a provision,

W.lll. c. 17. j8 «nd shall be drawn payable at a certain number of days weeks or months After date thereof, (1.) that from and after presentation and acceptance of the said bill or bills of exchange (which acceptance shall be

notice in writing shall be personally given, or left at the dwelling-house or place of business of the person charged, or sent by post on the day following the day of the dishonour, or the notice thereof, (in case of that day falling on a Sunday or great holiday) would answer all purposes of general convenience.

7. 1 apprehend the law to be, that if notice is gjlven by regular stages from each of the persons through whose hands the Bill has passed, the ultimate holder is entitled to recover against the drawer or any intermediate party, having received such notice m his regular turn—but if there has been an omission in any of the stages, the holder cannot in general recover. In Bateman v, Joseph, 12 E. 433. the notice was dispensed with, on the ground of its being proved, that the plaintiff did not know tlje defendant's residence, Lord Ellenborough, having left it to the jury, whether he had used due diligence to find it; but the uncertainty of these inquiries, and of the notion which a jury may form as to what shall or shall not be considered due diligence, is in its nature very inconvenient. 1 think the most eligible course would be to require every holder to subjoin to his name a direction, te which notice, in case of dishonour, should be addressed, upon peril of being excluded from objecting the want of notice, except as against the party to whom he made the immediate transfer. A notice in the Gazette, as affecting persons not giving their designation, might in some respects remove the inconvenience —but, 1 conceive, would be generally felt as objectionable, on account of the detriment to which parties might be collaterally subjected in consequence of such an exposure.

8. The liability of an indorser, who has been discharged by want of due presentment or notice in consequence of a subsequent promise, is a subject to which I have heretofore, before the existing doctrine was firmly established, directed no inconsiderable share of attention, (Appendix to Pothier, No. 18$) feeling, that such liability being usually founded on a

Somise, induced by mere terror under a mistaken ea of legal obligation, was not supported by the principles of correct judicial reasoning, or founded upon any adequate considerstien in point of law or moral expediency. The observation which 1 have made upon the kind of evidence usually given in the execution of such promises, does not much regard the subject in a more favourable point of view. The series of decisions which have taken place since my reasonings were submitted to the public, will no longer leave the question to be considered as open for any practical purpose, but subsequent reflection has rather confirmed than removed my original impressions, considering the matter on grounds of expedience and propriety, and as of sufficient importance for

legislative interference. When an engagement is entered into upon an express condition, the failure of the condition induces the nullity of the engagement, and there is no reason, as I have already intimated, to adopt a different rule with respect to a condition attached to and inherent in the nature of the engagement, and the subsequent promises relate to a matter in which the party making them has ceased to have any interest or coucem. Promises which have the effect of discharging the collateral exceptions founded upon infancy or the Statute of Limitations stand upon a very different footing from those which apply to a ground of defence affecting the very nature and substance of the original obligation. Upon a subject which has always appeared to me to he very analogous to that at present under discussion, the courts have adopted the principle which 1 have contended for, as founded upon the justice and rectitude of the case, it being settled that the signing off a loss on a policy of insurance is only evidence by way of acknowledgment that the obligation of indemnity has attached, and does not atop the party making such acknowledgment from shewing with effect the want of previous liability.

9. The proof of presentment, especially when the trial is at a distance from the place where it occurred, is attended with so much expence, that I conceive it would be beneficial, in all cases where the distance exceeded ten miles, to allow such proof to be made by the production of the protest, accompanied by an affidavit of the fact, made previously by a notary—but not to allow uch affidavit from a clerk, on whose credit the notary often acts in giving hit attestation to the protest. In admitting this alteration there would be little danger of the introduction of perjury— and perhaps the provision would be extended with advantage, by admitting similar proof of an official notification of the dishonour of the inatru10. The provision, by the statute of William, for supplying the loss of a Bill by the substitution of another, upon giving an indemnity, is too indistinct to be attended with much practical benefit. The regulation was borrowed from a subsisting practice in France, but there were facilities for giving it effect, in that country, which do not pibvail according to the English law. There were consular judges exercising a summary jurisdiction in commercial cases, and no Bills were transfer-rable by general indorsement—the security therefore required was only against the Bill haring been specially indorsed by the person alleging the loss, and no claim could be set up against it through the medium of robbery or accidental finding. As a sketch of a suitable provision upon the subject, I would suggest, that in case of a person having lost or been robbed of a Bill, it should be competent, within a given time, to

make affidavit of the fact, and give notice of such affidavit to the drawee—and also to insert a notification in the Gazette, that in case of a Bill being presented within a limited time, the party presenting it should be required to account for his ride by affidavit—and for a proper person to be invested with a summary authority to decide upon the tide to the Bill, or to direct an issue, as might be deemed expedient—and that upon nonproduction of the Bill within a limited time, for instance a month, the same remedies should be allowed as if the party having suttained the loss had had the actual possession. Proper provisions might be introduced forgiving a regular notification to the preceding parties, in the same manner as if the Bill were forthcoming.

11. 1 think it would be a great addition to the tenefit arising from Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes, if the parties in esse of default were rendered liible to an execution upon summary process, under the controul of a judge of the superior courts, with power to put any disputed question of law or fact into a proper course of examination. It would be a great check upon the random issue of accommodation paper, if parties were aware that their engagement extended to subject themselves to immediate execution in case of such default, whereas there is .very little scruple in giving a mere signature, which has no other effect than driving the holder to a desperate and probably unproductive action. This summary remedy was established in the law of Scotland

against the acceptor, and against the drawer and indorser, in case of non-acceptance, by an Act of 1681, and is extended to drawers and indorsers generally, by stat. 12 Geo. 3* c. 72. sec. 40. except where the indorsation is qualified to be without recourse. 1 apprehend that the provision has been found beneficial in'its consequences, and that it would not be lea so if adopted in England. To give effect to this and other summary proceedings, recqmmended in different parts of these notes, I am aware that some new arrangements would be requisite in the judicial establishment, upon which some general observations will be introduced in the second Number of the Appendix.

(1.) The Act does not apply to Bills made payable after sight*—Leftly v. Mills, 4 T. R. 170.

(2.) The protest cannot be made until the day after the Bill has become due—Bayley, 3 Ed. 123; the three days mentioned in the text are evidently the ordinary days of grace.

(3.) Thu notice is confessedly not sufficient to intitle the party to recover. The precise time within which notice must be given is not very accurately settled—but in no case is it sufficienr, unless given the day after that of the Bill being dishonoured, or of receiving notice thereof.

(4.) These costs are only the costs of protesting—not the legal costa of an action, which are recovered of course. Protest of an inland Bill it only necessary for the purpose of recovering interest and expenses. Vide 2 B. A. 696.

On the general Nature and Policy of the Law of Usury.

* In the following note respecting the law of usury, I shall frequently trail myself of Mr. PlowdenV Treatise upon the subject, although I very materially differ from him in my opinion of the wisdom and policy of the views upon which that system of laws is founded; conceiving thst the general principles so ably and satisfactorily established by Adam Smith, in favour of leaving to contracting parties the care of their own interear, are equally applicable to this subject as to any other—so far at least as regards the question of the general interest of the community, independently of the advantages which may result from the facility of obtaining money for the exigencies of the public, by enabling the Government to obtain the requisite loans, without any impediment from those restraints winch are supposed to be a benefit and protection to particular individuals—and that the instances of extortion and oppression which would occasionally result from removing the existing restraints upon the freedom of contract in the loan of money, would be only casual exceptions to the general benefit resulting from the adoption of such a system. Much of the prejudice which has existed against the receiving a compensation for the loin of money or other articles, of which the use is only in the consumption, arises from a mistaken view of the authority of the Scriptures upon the subject, and from drawing general inferences from particular premises and from ordinances applicable to the peculiar situation of the Jewish people—and even in modern times, the existence of any contracts for that purpose has been reprobated in the greater part of Europe, as a violation of those principles of Christian charity and benevolence which inculcate the performance of good offices without any object of personal benefit or remuneration. But the experience of all ages has shewn, that the sacrifice of individual interest, to the purposes of pure disinterested benevolence, is a principle of very partial and limited operation, and that the general intercourse of society can only be maintained by the mutual interchange of services, according to the respective powers and exigencies of the several members of the community; and although the rendering assistance to another, with the view of obtaining a full and adequate remuneration, has no claim to be regarded aa a virtue, it certainly by no means follows, that it is therefore to be reprobated as s crime. It is dear, that the true question as to prohibiting or regulating the compensation to be given for the tempo -rary use of money, considered in its general effects, is not between the obtaining the benefit of such assistance gratuitously, or upon more favourable terms, and the obtaining it for a particular equivalent; but between the obtaining it upon such equivalent as the lender may deem more advantageous than a different application of his property, and the suffering the loss and inconvenience which may rise from its being totally withheld—and there are very few writers who would now contend for

Class V.] Usury 265

* that by reason thereof little or no punishment hath ensued to the of *

fenders of the same, but rather hath encouraged them to use the

sameFor reformation whereof, be it enacted by the King our Sovereign Lord, by the assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and of the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That all and every the said Acts Statutes and laws heretofore made of for or concerning usury shifts corrupt bargains and chevisances and every of them, ana all pains forfeitures and penalties

the absolute prohibition of such a contract, however much they may approve of its being subjected to particular restraints and regulations *.

The very acute and masterly disquisitions of Mr. Bentham, (not the less profound and instructive far the lively and amusing manner in which they are conducted,) have greatly contributed to remove the impressions which were previously very general upon the subject—and, so far as my intercourse with society will enable me to form a judgment, an accordance with his sentiments in favour of an unrestricted commerce with regard to the interest of money, has become very prevalent, although certainly very ftr from universal.

• A very opposite sentiment is manifested by Lord Redesdale, in several of his judgments, as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. In the case of Molloy v. Irwin, 1 Sch.

& L. 312, he expresses himself as follows; —* I consider that transactions of this nature are set aside by courts of equity, not with a view to the individual, but on public grounds, in order to render the lending of money generally beneficial, by facilitating the means of procuring it on reasonable terms. This is the view in which the laws against usury are to be taken, and the principle on which they are to be supported, (particularly in a commercial country-,) against the theories of persons who have written on the subject; otherwise there is no reason why a man should not make the most of his money, as well as of any other species of property/ '

And in a preceding case, Drew v. Power, I Sch. & L. 182, hit Lordship intimates the same views upon the subject, at greater length, observing, thst the true reason on which the legislature hss said, that in bargains for money no more than a certain fixed sum shall be taken, by way of interest for the loan, is founded on great principles of public policy. First of all, it is more advantageous to the public, thst persons who are in possession of money should use their own industry in the employment of their money, than that they should sit idle and take the benefit of it through the industry of others, and therefore the loan of money at any large rate of interest has always been discouraged—and as a State becomes rich the interest of money is always diminished, with a view that a man who sits idle shall receive as low a rate of interest as can induce him to lend to another. But if a consideration of any description beyond that rate of interest can be had, the profit derived from that is lust as injurious to the public as if it were taken in the shape of a reservation of higher interest; and therefore the policy of the law would be completely defeated, if Courts were not to be jealous of such transactions as these, and were not to watch them with severity, and be sure that they did not permit persons, under cover of ordinary dealings between man and man, to obtain an advantage beyond the legal interest. If every man could obtain, for the loon of his money, as high a rate of interest, without hasard, as they do who employ it in trade or manufactures, which are hazardous undertakings, no man would employ his money in such hazardous undertakings—the most industrious of the people would be ground down by the usurers; they would get the profits of the trade, and the enterprising and industrious trader would be ruined: one sees every day, when traders who have been in the habit of borrowing become bankrupts, how large a share of their property is swallowed up by usurers."

’ It is manifest how completely all these observations take it for granted, that there is a certain quantity of money which must necessarily be lent out at interest,

• Mr. Barrington, after quoting the observation of Tacitus, that amongst the Germans fonus agitare ignotum, ideoque magi* servatur, quam si vetitum esaet, admits that the true reason, probably, for its not prevailing amongst them, or our ancestors, was that they had little or no personal property, and those who have landed estates have always been envious of the sudden fortunes raised by commerce, and the improvement and increase of personal estates. Treatise on Treatise may be written to prove, that these interests mutually support and strengthen each other; the prejudice indeed may be somewhat lessened, but canhot be eradicated. He adds, that

Sir Edwaid Fines, afterwards Baron Clinton, opposed a bill drawn by Judge Brooke, and moved in the House of Lords, by saying, Shew me a State without usury, and 1 will shew you a State without trade."—Ohs. on Statute of Merton, ch. 5.

and which borrowers would certainly obtain at a lower interest, if the lenders were restricted from advancing it at a higher—bow Completely they take it for granted, that persons exercising their own judgment would be ground down and oppressed by contracts which they voluntarily enter into with their eyes open, for the accommodation of money, to which they have no more dam than to any other property of the person advancing it* It b very true, that as countries advance in opulence, the fate of interest usually diminishes, t but this is not so much the effect of law as of the nature and order of things, by which the surplus moody becoming greater in proportion to the demand for its temporary use, the competition among lenders reduces the rate of accommodation to borrowers; and it is In this as in almost all the other cases evident, that the check upon (he mrtives of supply is rather an impediment to than a mean of facilitating the acquisition. By the Statute 28th Henry VIII. c. 14. no French wines are to be sold for more than elghtpence a gallon; but aebody can suppose that the quantity of Burgundy or dardt would be increased by carrying this Statute into executiones little will the loan of money, for the purposes of commerce, be promoted' by restricting the interest of it to five per cent, when, upon a free competition of contract between borrower and lender, it would purchase a much larger sum—and if in tbs nature of things it might be had for four, there would be no great practical effect in restricting it to five. The mention

t This is not by any means universally the case, as medem experience abundantly testifies. The commerce and opulence of the country have been inadmlably greater since money could not be generally obtained at five per cent, and upon indisputable security than they were when loans at four per cent, were morn genenl, and the receiving five per cent, was considered as an advantage. The difference arises from the great value attached to the command of ready money as an increment of commerce, increasing in proportion to the extent and magnitude of the commercial engagements to which that instrument can be applied; in the same manner as the rent of a house, in a busy town, will exceed die relit of ene, similar in other respects, in a remote and unfrequented situation.

Another important circumstance in the examination of this subject, it. the magnitude of the National Debt j in itself no doubt a considerable evil, but which furnishes strong evidence of the resources of the country, in which so large a capital could be withdrawn from the ordinary source of employment, in order to be invested upon permanent annuities, or more generally speaking, to be placed out at interest. The great advantage of this mode of investment, with respect to confidence in its security, punctuality in obtaining the stipulated payments, and facility of tiuhftr, would extend to give it a decided advantage over every other mode of investment, not connected with active employment. But the extent of the property of this description is so great as necessarily to reduce the proportionate numter of competitors for its acquisition, and consequently to diminish the price paid for hi ioquiri-tion { in other words, to produce a higher interest than would be otherwne obt uiied, in cate the amount of funded property bore a similar proportion to the surplus funds, which are applicable to the acquisition of it; while the grounds of preference already adverted to, sufficiently account for the smaller proportion of surplus capital invested in private securities, the competition for the benefit of such capital as is so employed, and consequently for the advanced rate of interest, without furnishing any reasonable ground for the inference of a declining state of national prosperity, in respect of the useful application of capital employed in the pursuits ci industrious enterprise; or for an unfavourable comparison, in these respects, contrary to the clear indisputable testimony of historical fact, with those periods when a much smaller rate of interest was generally received. Considering, therefore, how extensively the subject may be influenced by extrinsic circumstances, it does not appear that there is such a connection between a low and depressed state of interest, and a general state of national prosperity* as to render the legal restriction of the rate which would naturally follow the existing exigencies of society, and the consequent direction of capital employed into other channels more advantageous to its pomearor, a beneficial and politic exercise of legislative authority.

of the theories of persons who have written upon the subject is evidently intended to allude to rile work of Mr. Bentham—and tt certainly is very fashionable among those who think that political economy cannot be too extensively made a subject of positive regulation, to apply the appellation of speculators or theorists to others who argue hT favour of the utility of leaving traffic of any given description to its natural couise, and think that the interests of individuals may be safely confided to their own judgment and discretion. When it is admitted that, but for the sake of giving a greater facility to the advance of money upon reasonable terms, there Is no reason why a man shall not make the most of his money as well as of any other species of property, it seems to be overlooked that men have various ways of disposing of their money besides the lending it upon interest—-and if that particular mode is rendered less advantageous than it would naturally be, while many other modes are left without restraint, a very small portion of discernment is sufficient to enable the party to exercise that choice in such an application of his property which will be finest productive of his own advantage. And When it is remarked how large a share of the property of bankrupts is swallowed up by usurers. It is dear that the observation cannot be intended to apply to the case of usury, in a legal sense—for creditors, whose debts are really usurious, cannot have any pan of the property at all—and the fact, that leaden of money receive the greatest proportion of the property, only proves, that they are the persons who sustain the greatest proportion of the loss.

But 1 admit, that any observations upon this subject, however correct, as applicable to the general question of political economy, are not likely to reach beyond speculation—or to be attended with any practical effect in the alteration of the law.

The conviction, that the State alone can receive pecuniary assistance, unfettered by legal protection, and that thereby all competition is excluded from those whose mistaken views of their own advantage would induce them to go beyond the pale of protection which encompasses them, will in all probability be a lasting impediment to any material change of system; and while the law continues to subsist, and while, in the language of Lord Mansfield, it is considered as affording to persons a protection against themselves, there can be but one opinion upon the propriety of carrying it fairly into execution, according to its real object and intention

2. It seems to be agreed, that at common law usury was only lawful when Of the History practised by the Jews, and that when committed by Christians, it was an offence sad Progress of

the Laws.

t See some important observations by Mr. Sugden, in a pamphlet published in 1812, on the Annuity Act, and on raising the legal rate of interest, which are in* corporated in the last edition of his Treatise on Vendors and Purchasers. His examination of the comparison of the actual rate of interest usually taken when the restriction was imposed, with the legal rate which was considerably higher, and the distinctions which he makes from that circumstance is very material. Since the above note was completed, the Proposal for the Abolition of the Laws of Usury was introduced in Parliament, and met with a reception by which 1 was agreeably disappointed. The measure was unsuccessful, and was given up by the proposer; but the ground of opposition was the inconvenience which would arise from the sodden relinquishment of the existing system of law, an inconvenience which 1 am perfectly . ready to admit, and should therefore prefer seeing the measure carried with adequate provisions for the obviating such inconvenience, which would but be done by fixing a distant period, not less than two yean, for the commencement of the actual operation of the measure, if adopted. But a great progress was evidently made, when It appeared that of all the opponents to the measure, one only could be found who ventured to express an approbation of the existing law, as depending upon its proper merits. The member referred to has published a pamphlet in favour of the reduction of the present rate of interest, and u rtperted, m delivering his sentiments in Parliament, to have undertaken to confute the positions of Mr. Bentham, point by point. It did not however seem, that there wu any desire to call for the performance of this undertaking.

cognisable in the Spiritual court. The extent of the common law upon this subject, and its continuance since the paming of the existing statutes, are subjects upm which a difference of opinion is entertained, end which, for any practical purpose, it does not seem material to consider. Mr. Plowden's Treatise contains a dear and able discussion upon these questions, followed up by an interesting historical view of the state and conditions of the Jews in England, wherein he cites from Roger Hoveden a very curious ordinance of Richard I. for the regulating and registering the loans by them.

By the Statute of Merton, 30 Hen. VIII. c 5, it was provided, that usnry should not run against any being within age, from the time of the death of his ancestor until his lawful age, which statute it is agreed could only effect Jews. In the reign of Edward I. but in what year is uncertain, the Statute - De Jodahsno was passed, by which all usury was absolutely prohibited.

In the 3d of Henry VII. en Act passed against chevisance and usnry, (c. 5.) prohibiting any bargain by way of dry exchange, the object of which was the aupfim sion of bargains grounded in usury, coloured by name of new chevimnce. Hue wa followed by two other Acta of the same reign; vis. An Act against Exchange sad Re-exchange, Chevisance, Usury, snd Broken—3 Henry VII. c. 6 and an Act for repealing the Act last mentioned, and making more effectual provisions agaiac usury. By these Acts the term Usury is applied to all loans upon interest, and which were prohibited under certain penalties.

The Statute 37 Henry VIII. c. 9. (No. 1 of this Class,) repeals all preceding Acta, Statutes, and laws respecting usury, and is the foundation of the anbriertng law upon the subject.

This Act renders void all bargains for taking more for giving day of payment than tenper cent, per annum.

Toe Act against usury, 5 dr 6 Edward VI. c. 20. referring to the preceding Act of Henry VIII. states in the preamble, «• The which Act was not meant or intended for the maintenance and allowance of usury, as divers persons, blinded frith inorfi-nste love of themselves, have and do mistake the tame, but rather was nude and witnessed against all sons and kinds of usury, as a thing unlawful, as by die title and preamble of the said Act it doth plainly appear, and yet nevertheless the same was by the said Act permitted for the avoiding of more evil and inconvenience that before that rime was used and exercised:—But forasmuch as marie is by the word of God utterly prohibited as a vice most odious and detestable, as in divers plates of the Holy Scripture it if evident to be sent, which thing by no godly teachings and persuasions can sink into the hearts of divert greedie, uncharitable, and covetous persons of this rmhm, nor by any terrible threatening* of God?* wroth and vengeance that justly hangetk over this realm, for the groat and open usurie therein dauly used and practise^ they will foreake such JUthy gain and lucre, unless some temporal punishment be provided and ordained m that behalfThe Act, therefore, proceeding upon this accurate and judicious view of the subject, prohibits, under pern of imprisonment, fine, and ransom, the taking of any interest whatever. In the 19th of Elisabeth, (see No. 2 of this Class,) it was found, that this Act had not done so much good as it was hoped it should, and therefore the Act was repealed, and the prohibition of 37 Henry VIII. against taking more than ten per cent, was revived; the vice of usury still continuing the principel object in contemplation. The preamble of 21 Jac. 1. c. 17. [No. 3.] proceed* upon more moderate views of the subject, stating reasons for deeming ten per cent, too high s rate of interest, end therefore reduces it to eight, and concludes its enactments, as Paley observes, with the sage provision, M that no word in this law contained shall be comtrued or expounded to allow the practice of usury, in point of religion or‘conscienceand the subsequent Acts of 12 Charles II. c. 13. and 12 Anne, c. 16. reducing the rate of interest successively to six and from that to five per cent, where it has been left, leave ell spiritual views upon the subject out of the question, stating reasons of public policy, which, whether wise or otherwise, roust he considered ss evincing the spirit snd principles, according to which the construe* tion of the subsisting law is to he chiefly regulated.

$ 3. The operation of the statutes of usury is either by avoiding the contract, or On the Con-by subjecting the party taking usurious interest to the penalty of treble the principal struction of the sum lent, and upon this division of the subject are founded the two established prin- Law of Usury* tiplea; —1. That no penalty is incurred byentering into an usurious contract, with- Part I. Of the out actually taking usurious interest. 2. That a contract, not usurious, is not ren- Nature of the dered invalid by the Act of taking usurious interest. Contract.

The first point to be regarded is the kind of contract upon which the legal pro- (A) a, to ftc hibition attaches; and the general language of the cases upon the subject is, that in Nrrrsiinr of order to constitute usury there must be a loan; but certainly there are many in- there stances in whidi the doctrine of usufy has been applied to contracts that cannot, with much propriety, be considered as contracts of loan; the nature of which, sO far as relates to the present subject, consists in the supplying the borrower with s certain amount of money or other consumable property, for which a similar amount b afterwards to be returned with or without an additional compensation for the in- termediate use. This contract in the Roman law is known by the name of Mutuum, as distinguished from the loan of commodities to be specifically returned; and which, under different circumstances, is known by the names of Commodatum of Precarhtm. The latter species of loan is by the French law denominated Pr£t d* Usage, the former Pret de Consumption.

In Spurrier v. Mayoss, 1 Ves. jun. 531, it was said, by Lord Commissioner Eyre,

* Usury is taking more than the law allows upon s loan, or as I read it, for forbearance of a debt/' Even this view of the subject seems to be more confined than some of the undisputed authorities respecting it would seem to require.

In a case where Goulton was indebted to Flintoff, and Flinioflf to Wilson, it was ruled, that Wilson was guilty of usury by accepting a premium for accepting Goulton as debtor instead of Flintoff, and taking hit note for a year, and that the transaction was in substance a loan to Goulton—Wade v. Wilson, 1 East. 195. Where a surety for a debt gave a sum of money for forbearance of the debt, the transaction was ruled to be equivalent to a loan—Manners v, Postan, 3 B. & P. 343.

It is agreed on all hands, that if the real object and intention of the parties b ft) That no the loan of money, the legal consequences of usury will attach, whatever form or Colour can give colour may be apparently given to the transaction; the intention b a question of effect to Usury, fact to be determined by a jury, upon a general view of the circumstances of the *

case. The Statute 37 Hen. VIII. refers to any corrupt bargain, loan, eschange, chevisance, shifts, interest of an) wares or merchandises, or other thing whatsoever.

The Statutes of Chas. II. and Anne refer more comprehensively to any covin engine or deceitful conveyance. See upon this subject, Floyer o. Edwards, Cowp. 112—

Murray v. Harding, 2 BL Rep. 862. 3 Wils. 395—Low v. Waller, Doug. 736— .

Barber v. Vansommer, 1 Bro. C. C. 149—Davison v. Pitt, 1 Esp. N. P. 1; and as to requiring a borrower, Ac. c. to take goods instead of money, see Pratt v. Willey,

1 Esp. 40—Davis v. Hardacre, 2 Campb. 375—Coombe «. Mills, 2 Campb. 553.

Them are many cases in which it is taken for granted that the deducting upon rc) of Dts-the discount of a bill of exchange a larger sum than the amount of legal interest for counting wnu, the time the bill has to run is usurious; but I conceive that these cases are only considered applicable where the party, from whom the discount is taken, b to bear the risk of the solvency of the other parties, and not where the bill b purchased for smaller sum than the amount (deducting intermediate interest) at the risk of the purchasersod that the same doctrine may be applied to the bona Jide purchase of other debts. In Msssa v. Dauling, 2 Str. 1243, Lee, Ch. J. left it to the jury to find whether the transaction was to be deemed a purchase or a loan.

In Lee v, Cass, 1 Taunt. 511, a person applied to by the drawer to discount a bill refused to do so, but on the condition that he should be permitted to guarantee the payment by the acceptors at a certain rate; there was no doubt of the solvency of the acceptors, and the only reason for the guarantee was the refusal to discount the bill on any other terms. The jury considering this to be a shift to obtain a higher rate or interest than 51. per cent, found a verdict for the plaintiff; and upon motion for a new trial, on the ground that there was no forbearance to )he drawer,

in as much at the contract of guarantee protected him from payment at all events, the Court of C. B. held, that the objection was not well founded, for clearly there was a forbearance till the bill became due, and the guarantee would not protect the drawer from the payment of the bill in the hands of any other holder, but would immediately give him a right to recover against the defendant; and ithat if the objection were valid, it would give a complete facility and security to usury. 1 should conceive that the grounds of this case might be more effectually supported according to the principle of legal reasoning by resting it on the finding off the jury as to the real nature of the transaction than upon general doctrine, that s boom fed* contract might not he made for the purchase of an accepted hill from the drawer^ with a consideration for guaranteeing the payment by the acceptor.

A discount of a bill by a country banker to J. . deducting interest for the whole time, although part of the payment at the request of J. . was made in hills payable at a future date, was held not usurious, as the surplus might be referrable to expence of remittance, it being found by the jury to be a fair transaction in the usual course of business. See Hammett v. Yes, 1 B. & P. 144. in which the general nature of the subject is very ably discussed; but deducting the whole interest upon one bill, with an agreement that another bill which had time to run should be taken as cash, was held usurious—Parr v. Eliason, 1 East 92. Deducting interest for the whole time, and giving bills at three days' sight, without inquiring in what shape the purchaser choose to receive the balance, was held usurious—per Lord Kenyon, at N. P. Matthews v. Griffiths, Peake 200; a deduction of 7s. 6rf. per cent, for coronation by a discounter put to no expence or considerable trouble, was held usurious—per Ixurd Ellenborough, 1 Camp. 445; a commission of 5s. per cent, taken by a country banker upon discounting bills was holden not usurious—Winch v. Fenn, 2 T. R. 52; so Baynes v. Fry, where a reasonable compensation was taken for the trouble of sending bills about for acceptance and payment; and see Auriol v. Thomas, 2 T. R. 52—Ex parte Jones, 17 Ves. 332. 15 Ves. 120—JEr ports Henson, 1 Mad. 112.

In Barclay v. Walmsley, 4 E. 55, it 'was ruled, that an acceptor of a Bill of Exchange was not guilty of usury for taking a consideration of more than the amount of legal interest for paying it before it was due. It was argued, that it would be very easy to evade the Statutes of Usury by framing securities in this form; hot Lord Euenborough said, M That to constitute usury there must either be a direct loan and a taking of more than legal interest for the forbearance of re-payment, or there must be some device contrived for the purpose of concealing or evading the appearance of a loan and forbearance when in truth it was such; but here was no loan or forbearance, only a mere anticipation of the payment of a debt by the party before the time, when by law he would be called upon for it—that the defendant had been guilty of a very improper practice, but not of usury.*’—It is difficult to discover wherein the alleged impropriety consisted, there being no suggestion of any undue influence, or any other objection to the transaction, than that which was founded in the general nature of the transaction itself. Usury being now admitted to be a matter of positive law, and the real value of the use of money being a matter of as much fluctuation as the price of Stocks, or any other commodity, the only inquiry would seem to be, whether the case is or is not within the prohibition of the law; that the party who gave the consideration had an adequate motive of interest or convenience in doing so may without much difficulty he taken for granted; and it is easy to conceive, that a less compensation than that which was taken would not have been so beneficial an employment of the money of the party advancing it as other applications which his own occasions might require. In exports Henson, 1 Mad. 116. an objection being taken to the proof of a debt, in consequence of 10s. per cent, being agreed to be paid as commission on a bill, the V. C. said, u The biU was delivered in part payment of an antecedent debt, not in consequence of any ’contract for the loan of money. There was no loan of money, nor. any thing done colourably and as a veil of usury."

' In Marsh v. Martindale, 3 B. & P. 154. an annuity of 5001. had been granted in consideration of 3500/. redeemable upon payment of the original contideration, with all arrears, costs, and expences, upon giving six months’ notice or allowing half % year’s annuity. An agreement was entered into for the cessation of the annuity, upon receiving a Bill of Exchange for 5000L payable at the end of three years, which 5000L was made up by the original purchase-money and axresrs of the annuity

—an allowance for redeeming without notice—a sum paid in cash, and the interest for 50001. for three yean. This deduction of the three years* interest in the first place, and at the time of the advance being held upon grounds unconnected with the present part of the discussion to exceed the legal rate of interest, the transaction was deemed by the Court of Common Pleas to be usurious. The opinion of the Court, upon this point of the case, is expressed by Lord Alvanley as follows:—" It was contended that the transaction was, to all intents and purposes, the purchase of an annuity, and it has been determined in all cases, that the purchase of an annuity, however exorbitant the terms may be, can never amount to usury. But If the transaction respecting the annuity be only a cover for the advancement of money by way of loan, it will not exempt the lender from the penalty of the Statute, or prevent the securities from being void; then is this transaction the purchase of. an annuity or not ? I admit, that if the annuity had been irredeemable, the plaintiff would have had a right to say, that he would not sell it under 50001. But here the party was entitled to redeem on payment of 4003/. It was then proposed that a sum should be advanced, making with the purchase-money 4250/. and that a bill of 5000/. should be discounted at three years. What is this but forbearing for three yean to take the sum of 4250/. for which forbearance he was to receive interest on 5000L ?" Upon very frequent consideration of this case, and with every endeavour to divest my mind of any general impression which I may entertain, I cannot but think the decision extremely objectionable and wholly repugnant to the principles which have usually prevailed in the discussion of the subject. With respect to the supposed right to redeem; it was a right depending upon the condition of an actual advance of the stipulated amount, and for which the party was under no obligation to accept a substitution, and the case not being within the condition snd terms of the stipulation, was as much a matter of open contract as if no such stipulation had existed, and supposing the stipulation out of the case, a sum of 5000L payable immediately, might have been legally received as a consideration for the cessation of the annuity, and consequently d fortion, an equal sum payable at a future period— but the more important consideration of the question arises from the kind of object winch is in the contemplation of the contracting parties. The whole system of usury, commencing with theological prejudices and continued upon Considerations of political expediency, was to prevent the taking an undue advantage of persons who might be willing to give an excessive compensation for the present pleasure or convenience of having a sum of ready money at immediate command—and almost all the cases which have arisen respecting the evasion of the Statute have turned upon the temptation of an immediate pecuniary accommodation received, or at least upon the exemption from and forbearance of paying a sum of money which might have been immediately demanded; but in the case in question, no such pecuniary accommodation was in the contemplation of the parties. Leaving out of consideration the small sum advanced for the purpose of making up the amount, no money, nor any thing regarded as immediately convertible into money, was advanced —no money which could have been immediately demanded was forborne; the whole object was the cessation of a valid but inconvenient obligation, for the cessation of which (subject to the express stipulation of redemption upon different terms) the parties were as much at liberty to contract, according to their respective views of their own convenience, as upon the purchase of an estate or any other conceivable subject.

A contract upon the sale of goods to receive a higher price exceeding the legal /e\ Qf Disrate of interest, if the price were not paid in a given time, was ruled to be not counts, Ac. c. on usurious, it appearing to be the usage of the particular trade—Floyer v. Edwards, the §jje Qf Cowp. 112; but tbit profit was, in a subsequent action for money had and received, disallowed as unreasonable, and one which could not be recovered in that species of action, although not usurious—Plumbe v. Carter, Cowp. 116. Thia decision was in a great measure founded upon the particular views of Lord Mansfield, with respect to the action for money had and received, as enabling the Court to take a more comprehensive view of the fairness and propriety of the transaction, than in other proceedings resting upon a question of mere legality. In a subsequent case, when it was agreed between a bleacher and his customer, that the former should send in his accounts every three months, and that in case of immediate payment a discount should be taken off of 30 per Cent, the commissioner! of bankrupt refused to allow

a proof for more than the sum to which the debt would be reduced to by the stipulated discount, with an addition of five per cent.—and Lord Loughborough dismissed a petition for an allowance to prove the remainder of the demand, although it appeared to be according to the custom of the trsde; observing, that the trade of a gold refiner, upon which Floyer and Edwards arose, had been turned into a cover for usury—and that the custom of the trade could not make the debt more than the money really advanced with five per cent. The creditor could not have more than five per cent.—Ex parts Aynsworth, 4 Vesey, 678. This short judgment does not take a very distinct view of the case; it speaks of money advanced, and not taking more than five per cent, upon the money so advanced, and at the same time the transaction is not treated as usurious, for the party was allowed to recover what was considered as the actual debt, with five per cent, thereon; and the real question, which was of no small importance, was not fairly met, vis. how far a party upon sale of goods, or other contract unconnected with the loan of money, may agree to make an abatement, upon payment within a stipulated time; and how far the sum, to which the price would be roduced by such abatement, should be regarded as the real price. There is no ground whatever far allowing the interest, so fir as the amount of 51, per cent, unless as connected with the period of a year, which was no ingredient in the case, and very few tradesmen would not prefer making a reduction of a greater amount, in case of immediate payment, to allowing the demand to remain open upon general credit. When the discount is of so large an amount as in the case referred to, and so far beyond any advantage which could be anticipated by the mere difference of the time of payment, it seems reasonable to conclude, that the transaction is only a contrivance to aecure a larger dividend in case of. bankruptcy, and not as a substantial contract intended to be acted upon between advent parties j but this view of the subject is wholly connected with the question c£ usury.

The following cases have occurred upon questions of usury, as connected with the sale of real estates. In Dewar v. Span, 3 T. R. 425. upon the sale of an estate in the West Indies, it was agreed, as part of the contract, that part of the purchase-money should remain at interest, at six per cent, which was ruled to be usurious. The discussion principally turned on the effect of St. 14 Geo. IIL c. 79. respecting West India securities, (see No. 6 of this title.) It was urged, that as the payment of stlch interest was part of the contract, the bond given for securing it was legal, and that the transaction could not be called usury within the true meaning of the Statutes, for they all relate to loans of money, and here 'was no loan at all; that, in Yeoman tn Barton, I Lutw. 271, it was declared, that the plaintiff sold the defendant several pieces of hammered money, to the amount of 300/. which the defendant promised te pay, with 4/. 10s. interest, at the end of eight months, and the Court held there was no loan, without which there could be no usury. The opinion of the Court was pronounced by Lord Kenyon, merely upon the effect of the Statute of Geo. III. accompanied by the general observation, " that if the present attempt were to succeed, it would sap the foundation of the Statutes of Usury.’* This point has always appeared to me to be entitled to a rather more serious notice, and the case to have been decided with too much of that hurry which has too often blended itself with the administration ef justice, and even been the theme of panegyric by confounding it with proper dispatch. It is very evident, that a modification of the terms of a contract of sale has si little affinity as possible with the transactions, which the Statutes of Usury were intended to restrain and correct; but this hasty and sudden determination, pronounced on the impulse of the foment, is considered by Mr. Plowden as establishing a doctrine most evidently at variance with the general principles of the subject, and the previous course of judicial determinations. A much more accurate view of the Law of Usury appear* to have been taken by Lord Commissioner Eyre, in Spurrier v. Mayoas, 4 Bra. Ch. 28. On sale of an estate the defendants paid part of the purchase-money, and agreed to pay the remainder at a certain day, with 5L per cent, interest, or otherwise to pay a rent, (considerably exceeding the amount of legal interest,) deducting 6/. per cent.

on the amount which should be paid. The opinion of the Lord Commissioner was as follows:—*1 The language of the agreement gave it, to my mind, the appearance of Usury; but when one defines Usury, and looks at die spirit of the agreement, the first impression does not seem sufficiently strong to sustain the defence. Usury is the taking of more then Si. per cent, for the forbearance of a debt. Hie first question therefore is. Was there a debt ? 1 think not. The whole rested upon an executory agreement, which, for performance, depended on many circumstances which might prevent its ever becoming a debt. This however is a narrow ground— take it on the more general ground, as disclosed by the proceedings, the contract was for a title, and almost for ready money. Possession, till the completion of the title, was a fair subject of contract between the parties. In the event of the money not being paid, a new idea appears to have occurred to the parties, as to the posses* eion. The bargain for title was to be suspended, and a new relation to arise be* tween the parties, namely, that of landlord and tenants. If so, there is nothing -usurious. If they turned themselves into those characters, the plaintiff might well be considered as entitled to rent till he put the estate out of him. The language of the agreement ought not to control what I conceive to have been the substance of it; and as it is an executory agreement, the Court has more room to give it I liberal construction."

Nothing can be more manifest than the justice of the principle stated in this opinion, that the language of the agreement ought not to control what it supposed to be the substance of it. See also as to contracts for interest upon interest, upon the sale of a partnership interest, Tarleton «. Backhouse, Coop. Ch. R. 331.

It is ruled not to be usurious to advance a sum of money arising upon the sale of (g) Of Coo* stock, in consideration of receiving the same amount of stock at a future day, or of tracts reapect-replacing the stock at a given day, and in default thereof paying the money ad* ing the &de of vanced at a subsequent day, with the amount of the dividend that would have been Transfer of produced by the stock in the mean time—Tate v. Willing!, 3 T. R* 531; or in Stock consideration of forbearing to sue for a debt, to agree at a given day to purchase such stock as might have been purchased with the debt at the time of the agreement being made, with such interest as the stock would have produced in the mean time *

—Sanders v. Kentish, 8 T. R. 162—Maddock v. Rumball, 3 East. 304. And where stock was lent upon a bond to replace it on a given day, with interest at 61. per cent, in the mean time upon the sum which the stock produced, the stock not having been replaced at the time, it was held that the lender waa entitled to tho amount produced by the sale of the stock with interest, and not compellable to accept the amount of the stock, (which had fallen,) with the dividends which had accrued thereon in the mean time.—Forrest v. Elwes, 4 Vesey, 492. [This case was not argued on the ground of Usury.] But where a certain amount of stock wan to be transferred, or the value thereof, at a particular day then past, when a loan ought to have been repaid, or paid at the option of the fender with interest in tbo mean time, the Master of the Rolls ruled the contract to be usurious, as it reserved the capital with legal interest, and likewise a contingent advantage, without putting . either capital or interest in any kind of risk, and it was usurious to stipulate for the chance of that advantage.—Barnard v. Young, 17 Vesey, 44 *

Where bankers agreed to give credit in account to a person who was indebted to them for a certain turn, for which he waa to purchase stock of a certain amount* and which at the then current price was more than the money credited would purchase, and account for the dividends as from the last dividend day, and the sum was credited accordingly and drafts honoured by the bankers; it was held that the contract was usurious, though the price of stocks waa leas than when several of thn sums were advanced; but that the party waa entitled to credit in account for thn amount agreed upon.— Boldero v. Jackson, 11 East. 612. Where money was advanced upon the security of Omnium, which was to be taken back by the borrower at a fixed advance of price at a day certain, and the difference in price exceeded 5& per cent, for the period, the transaction waa ruled to be usurious—Smedley q. t *

Roberts, 2 Camp. N. P. 607* Where a peison having a vested interest in stock* which he could not transfer till a future day, sold his interest in the principal and dividends at a rate below the current price, it was holdea not usurious.—-Pike Vm Ledwell. 5 E«x N. P. 164.

(h) As to Annuities for Yean.

(i) On Contracts of Ha-sanL

The puwluM of an anauky for years with a power of redemption doee not SB within the Statutes of Usury if btma fid* made, and there is no ewgadoe to i»far* chase, although the annuity nay exceed the legal rate of intaraat. Thus, where D. had agreed to purchase a lease tor 40 yeaxa, subject to the rent of 51. and net bavins the money, B. by agreement with him, paid the 300/. and took an assignment to himself, and then demised the premises to B. for 39 yean at the rent of 351. of which the original rent waa to be part; and D. covenanted to pay the rent, Ac. c.; and B. agreed, that if D. should pay him 300L at the end of four yean, the rest should cease, and he would reconvey the estate. By Hale, C. J. this was not Vmr, within the Statute, for D. was not obliged to pay the 300/. but at his ejection might pay it if he choose, and thereby determine the rent and have the term, eo that in effect it waa only a bargain for an annuity of 30/. for 39 yean, to be secured in the manner, but determinable sooner if the grantor pleased; but the grantee bed as remedy to recover the 300/. if the grantor did not think proper to pay it; but if B. had any security for the re-payment of the money, or by anycoUatenl agreement it was to have been repaid, that had been Usury—Rex «. Duty, 2 Lev. 7; and in Tanfield v, Finch, Cro. Elis. 27, it was held, that the giving 566/. for an annuity of 120/. for twenty-three yean was no usury, where there was no previous coomeet-cation to have-any consideration for the loan of the 566/. $ but Bell, Chief Bona, said, that if two men speak together, and one dewreth the other to lend him 100L he will give him above 10/. per annum, and for an evasion of the Statute they invent this practice, that he shall grant to the other 30/. per annum out of his land for 10 yean, this is Usury, although he never have his 100/. again. But if bomrnfidtmc buyeth an annuity of 40/. for tea years for 100/. this is no Usury, if the first communication was not corrupt—see Symonds o. Cockerill, Noy. 151. died, B. A P. 160, to the same effect.

It is a settled point, that if the principal sum advinced is by the tonne of the contract fairly put in hazard, no Usury is incurred by taking more -than the legal rate of interest, but that the Usury is not prevented t>y hazard which only affects the interests, or as it is laid down by Dodderidge, C. J. in Roberta «. Trenayue, Crow Jac. 507. if I lend 100/. to have 120/. at the year’s end upon a casualty$ if the casualty goes to the interest only, and not to the principel, it is Usury; for the party is to have the principal again come what will; but if the principal and interest are both at hasard, it is then not Usury.

The reasonableness of this distinction is not quite evident, for if the chances we equal upon which double the interest is to be paid, and the whole interest is to be lost, it would seem to be a fair wager of the amount of the interest, but it is a distinction which is always recognised and acted upon.

Upon the general doctrine of placing the principal in hasard, it waa ruled, in the famous case of Lord Chesterfield u Janson, 2 Ves. 125. I Ath. 301. 1 Wile. 286. that a post obit bond on receiving 5000/. to return 10,000l. if John Spencer the obligor survived his grandmother, the Duchess of Marlborough, was not usurious. Upon this principle all bottomry contracts are supported. So an agreement in coo-aideration of 100/. to pay SQL to each daughter of a person having five who shall be living at the end of ten years—Bedingfield v. Ashley, Cro. Elis. 741.

But a mere colourable hasard win not take the case out of the Statute. Thus, itt the preceding case, the Court held, that if the contract had been that he abeuld pay at the end of one «r two years 300/. if any of the children were alive, that had been Usury—so in Mason v. Ahdy, Carth. 67; and by the name of Mastin «. Ab-dee, Shew 8. Hoh, C. J. said, that dying within six months was no hazard, and therefore usurious—and see Richards v, Brown, Cowp, 770.

It is dear that the hazard must be one arising out of the terms of the contract itself, and not the common hasard, that the contract may not be performed from the insolvency of the borrower j and upon this ground it wes ruled, that e loan open which the lender was, beyond legal interest, to receive a certain portion of the profits of a trade, was usurious, although it was objected that by receiving a share of

the profits he would, with respect to third persons, render himself liable for all the debts and losses—Morse n Wilson. 4 T. R. 353.

The stipulating by a factor for a higher commission, beyond legal interest, on his (k) Of Lorn advances of money than he would hare had if he had not furnished the money, Was ruled accompanied by by Lord Ellenborough, at Nisi Priiw, to be usurious—Harris t, Boston, 2 Campb. 348 Services.

An assignment of a contract for the purchase of timber to secure certain advances with charges, and 200/. as a compensation for trouble in the business, was

ruled not to be usurious on the face of it, it not appearing that any pan of it waa intended as an additional bonus for the advance of the money—Palmer v. Baker, lM.andS.56.

In Burton's case, 5 Co. 60. b. it is laid down, that an agreement to pay 201, a year (*) Of Pcnal-from Michaelmas next, if 100/. is not paid by Michaelmas, is not usurious, for the t, c* *n Case of pany may repay it before Michaelmas without interest, if this was the true intent, Non-pavment and there are several other authorities to the same effect. Mr. Plowden mentiohs Pnncithe case of Moore v. Battie, before Lord Keeper Henley, Amb. 371, as overruling P»l* this doctrine; but the case was not apparently considered in that view by Lord Henley himself, nor does any such inference result from it, there being no intention in that case that the borrower should at any time repay the money without interest.

I should entertain, however, very little doubt that it is an agreement against which a Court of Equity would relieve upon the payment of the principal and legal interest, and the contract would be regarded with much suspicion in a Court of Law, aa furnishing evidence of an actual intention for the payment of usurious interest.

With respect to the interest or other compensation to be paid, m Barnes r. Wor- (m) of the la-lich, Cro. Jac. 25. Yelv. 30. 1 Roll, 510. Moor 644, (by the name of Worley's case, terest. and see Dalton's case, Nny. 171,) a question was raised, whether it was usurious to stipulate for the payment of interest at the full rate allowed by Statute for half a year. The ground of t he doubt was, that for the space between the end of the half year and the end of the half year interest might be made on the interest, sothat more than the rate allowed would be made on the whole sum for the year; and the importance of this consideration would become very manifest by reversing the cate, and reflecting that a re- payment of principal with simple interest, at the end of ten years, would be a very moderate compensation, supposing the legal interest to be the actual value for a loair -or forbearance for one year. The decision was in favour of the legality of the contract; but it was said, that if the lender had agreed to take his money for the forbearance instantly when he lent it, that had made the assurance void, for there he had not lent the entire sum for one year, and the other had not the use of his money according to the intention of the law.—See ex pane Bevan, 10 Vesey, 223, as to stipulations for half-yearly settlements, and charging interest in the balance in mercantile transactions. In Lloyd v. Williams, 3 Wils. 252. 2 Bl. 702, it appears, by the later report, that Sir Wm. Blickstone was of opinion, that interest might as-lawfolly be received beforehand for forbearing, as after the term is expired for having, forborne, and that it should not be reckoned as merely’ a loan of the balance, elso every banker in London, who takes five per cent, for discounting bills, would be guilty of Usury.

The deducting, in the first instance, the full legal rate of interest, upon the discount of bills and notes, is fully agreed not to be usurious. But in Marsh r. Mar-tindale, 3 B.&P. 154. it was considered that that doctrine arose merely out of the course of trade, and Lord Alvanley, in delivering the judgment of the Court, taid,

* If nothing more has been done in this case than what has always been done by way of accommodation among merchants, the transaction was not usurious; but the rule must be confined strictly to that sort of transaction, for if discount be taken in an advance of money, without the negotiation of a bill of-exchange, it will amount to usury, aa appears dearly from the cases which were rited in the agreement/ '

(vis. Barnes v. Worledge, and Dalton's case above cited,) and in the principal case it being agreed, that 5000/. should be paid at the end of three yean, for advances amounting to 4250/. or in other words, that three years' interest of 5000/. to be paid at the expiration of that time, should be deducted in the fint instance, the caw

(n) How far the Question of TJsury depends upon the Intent of the Parties,

as a Question of Fact,

was holden to amount to usury. In a preceding part of this note, the case has been mentioned with reference to the question, whether the nature of the transaction was such as to render the law of usury properly applicable.

The taking of excessive interest is usurious, although taken in the form of rent, at the rate of .'>0/. for half a year for a house worth only 201. a year—Bcdo r. Jackson, Cro. Jac. 440 $ and see the observation of Lord Hardwicke to the same effect, iu Adlington v. Cano, 3 Atk. 154; see also Jetson v Brooke, Cowp 793.

In Morisset v. King, 2 Bur. 621. in consideration of 1001. advanced by M. to be repaid without interest at the end of four years, K. agreed to board the daughter of M. and that she should be co-partner with his wife, in the business of a milliner, &c. the contract was ruled not to be usurious, as K. might receive so much advantage by the partnership as to be worth the consideration.

The question of usury often depends upon the particular intent of the parties to the contract, so as to reduce the point in dispute to a mere question of fact for the decision of the jury, whether it was or was not intended to take a greater interest than the law allows upon the loan or forbearance of money. It has been already stated as an established principle, that if the real nature of the transaction, as founded on the intention of the parties, be found by the jury to he an usurious loan, no form or colour, which may be given to it, will prevent the law for restraining such transaction from having its full operation, and several cases were referred to as supporting snd illustrating that proposition. In the case of Hamnett t>. Yea, 1 Bos. & P. 144. where upon discounting a bill, bills at thirty days and smaller periods were charged as cash, Eyre, C. J. observed to the jury, that the bills appeared to be in <he nature of a remittance of the borrower's money to London, and if the plaintiffs , Jiad not taken more than a reasonable compensation for their trouble, unless indeed , - the mode of payment had been made a term on which alone the bills would be discounted, it was not usury; and the jury having found the transaction not to be .usurious, his Lordship, upon application for a new trial, said that whether more than 5/. per cent, was intentionally taken upon any contract for forbearance, vras a mete question of fact for the consideration of the jury, and must always be collected from jthe whole of the transaction as it passes between the parties—and he was of opinion, riist it never could be determined that any particular fact constitutes or amounts to ^usury till all the circumstances, with which it was attended, had been taken into consideration—and, in the course of his judgment, he repeatedly expressed himself to the same effect, shewing that under the circumstances there was jmt ground to warrant the conclusion which the jury had drawn $ and, the other judges concurring in the same doctrine, a new trial was refused.

Where the intention of the parties was not to commit usury, but the deed was so drawn by mistake of the scrivener as upon the face of it to be usurious, it waa held tihat the statute did not attach. The agreement was on the 23d of May for a loan .for a year, and the bond waa made for payment of the principal and a year's interest, on the 24th of May next ensuing, and there was a question whether this should be construed to mean the 24th of the same May, or the 24th of May in the following year, but all the Court held, that although it should be expounded to refer to the same month snd year, which was the next day, yet as the agreement was found to be to make the loan for a year, and that the assurances were fa payment at the end of the year, and by the scrivener's mistake it was made payable the next day, it waa not usury within the statute, for there was not any corrupt agreement betwixt them, but a true and absolute agreement, and the act of a stranger should not bring the party within the danger of the statute—Buckley v. Guildbank, Cro. Jac. 678; so where the plaintiff by his replication alleged that the agreement was for forbearance for a year, and by the scrivener's mistake it was made payable at the half year's end, and he not knowing thereof accepted the bond, the Court ruled that such an allegation might be well madej for it was the shewing of the true agreement, that no interest was to be paid by the said agreement but such as stood with the law—Nevison t\ Whitley, Cro. Car. 501; and where the plaintiff replied, that it was agreed that he should lend to the defendant 501. at 51. per cent, and that the scrivener should take a lawful bond, with condition to pay interest at 51. per cent, and that the scrivener, in the absence of and without the notice of the plaintiff, took the bond whereby, by the mistake of the scrivener, 2L 10a. was inserted for six months, and traversed the corrupt agreement, it waa ruled to be the same case with the preceding—Bush v. Buckingham, 2 Vent. 63; so a bill given fa excessive interest, by a mistake of calculation, was held available for the sum really due.—Glaasfurd, v. Lang, 1 Camp. N. P. 149.

In Le Grange v. Hamilton, 4 T. It. 613. a bond was given fa payment of 1001. with interest, at 5L per cent, in payments of 201. yearly, by quarterly payments of 5L until the whole should be paid, and a memorandum waa indorsed, that at the

Class V.] Usury. 2ft

end of each year the years interest due was to be added to the principal, and then Nq, I,

the 20/. received was to be deducted and the balance remain as principal. Lord, viTT

Kenyon thought the consideration was, that a year's interest should be charged on "• VIII,

the whole, without allowing for the intermediate payments, which would be usurious C. 9.

—the other judges thought, that the memorandum was only for the purpose of 1 j— — *

adding the interest, which became due in the course of the year, to the principal, so as to make the whole carry interest till part of it was again reduced—and Ashurst and Grose J. held that if the Court could by any reasonable construction consider it not . to be usury, they were bound to do so.

But if the agreement entered into is such as appears to the Court to be usurious, the case falls within the statutes, although the parties might not be aware that they were transgressing the law.—Thus in Marsh v. Mart indale, 3 B. & P. 154. already twice cited upon the principal points, Lord Alvanley said, " I stated to the jury, that if a man agree to take more than ft/. per cent, the law declares that to be such an agreement as is corrupt, whether the party thought at the time he were acting contrary to the law or not, and though the jury have found, that the plaintiff" did not think he was acting contrary to the law, there is nothing in that finding to prevent us examining the transaction, and declaring it to be corrupt if it appear to us to be so in point of law, without sending the cue back to a jury to find the corruption.* '

And in Barnard v. Young, 17 Vesey, 44. already cited, where a contract to pay money or replace stock, at the option of the lender, was holden usurious the master of the Rolls after stating his opinion upon the contract, added u Then fore, though it was not probably so intended, this is in fact an usurious contract.' *

In an action for the penalties the essential charge t3, as has been observed, the part II. On the taking usurious interest; for, however usurious the contract may be, no penalty is penalties of incurred without taking such interest. Usury.

* Whether the taking more than legal interest, without a previous contract for the purpose, does or does not subject the party to the penalty, seems not to be perfectly settled. In Rex r. Allen, Sir T. Raym, 195, Twisdcn, J. laid it down, that if the party do not contract for more than the Statute allows, and afterwards he will take more, the assurance shall not be avoided, but the party shall forfeit the treble value $ as if a man, when money was at 8/. per cent, lends money and takes bond for the same, and the Statute 12 Car. II. is made, and he will continue the old interest upon that bond, the bond shall not be avoided by such acceptance of interest, but the party shall forfeit the treble value by the Statute, but no judgment was given.

With respect to the matter stated by Twisden, by way of illustration, it seems to-be agreed, that a contract made before the Statute reducing the rate of interest is no way within the meaning of the Statute, and that it is still lawful to receive the former interest in respect of such contract.—See 1 Hawk. P. C. 22. sec. 12—Walter v.

Peury, 2 Vern. 14ft. I Eq. Ab. 288, Whether the contract, otherwise than in respect of the penalties, continues as to the higher rate, is a point upon which the two authorities last cited seem to differ.

In an anonymous case, 1 Vent. 38. temp. 21 Car. II. the information was ior taking usurious interest for three quarters of a year then passed, not averring, as it seems, any* preceding corrupt agreement. Ujn>n motion m arrest of judgment, on the ground that as the time of forbearance was past the party might give what he pleased in recompence, there being no preceding agreement, the Court overruled the objection, and said they would expouud the Statute strictly— and if liberty were allowed in that case, the brokers might oppress the people exceedingly, by detaining the pawn, unless they would give them what they would please to demand for the rime after future of payment. In R. v. Walker, 1 Sidcrf. 421, (which is supposed by Mr. Plowden to be the same case) but is of Trin. 19 Ch. II. the Court upon the like objection are reported to have held, that if the case was not within the Statute 12 Ch. II. the taking was an offence at common law, and therefore they gave judgment of fine and imprisonment.

If, after an agreement for legal interest, a subsequent agreement is made for more interest, it is usury, and the penalty is incurred by taking such interest, but it does not avoid the original contract.—See Reg. v. Lewel, 7 Mod. 119. In Brown v.

Fullbey, 4 Leon. 43. it was the opinion of the Court, that although the usurious interest agreed upon was tendered and the Under did tell the same, yet, if he did not take and accept it, he did not incur the forfeiture.

In Mallory v. Bird, cited Cro. Elis. 20. it is said, if one contracts to have 20/. far the loan of 100/. if he taketh nothing of the 20/. he is not punishable by the statute; but if he taketh any thing, if but one shilling, this is an affirmance of the contract, and he shall answer for the whole contract. But Ashton, J. upon this case being cited, observed, that it meant one shilling above the legal interest; and such is

the construction which has always prcniM in practice—tee Fisher r. Beasley, Doug. 235.

As by statute 31 Bl». c. 5. all actions and informations upon penal statutes mast be commenced within the time prescribed after committing the offence, it is often a material question at what time thereby prescribed after committing the o/fcace, k is often a material question at what time the act of taking usurious interest or compensation is complete. Upon this subject the following cases have occurred:— Id lioyd, q. tc. Williams, upon a loan of 1004. for three months, it was agreed, that the borrower should give 64. 5s.; the 1004. was advanced, and the borrower immediately paid the 64.5s. for interest by way of advance, and gave his promissory note for 1UU4. at three months; the court of C. B. held, (hat as the 1Q0L was actually lent by the defendant to the borrower, who received it with one hand and immediately paid the 64.5s. with the ocher hand, the offence was then completely committed, and the time being more than a year before the commencement of the action, the plaintiff1 could not recover. Gould, J. (according to the report of Blackstone, vol. 2, p. 794,) inclined to think that the original loan was only of 934. 15s^ the 64. 5s. being taken thereout; but he agreed that the plaintiff could not recover upon that action, which was brought for 300/. or the treble 100/., the sum of 100/. alleged to be lent. The view of Gould, J. as to the question of loan, provided the declaration had been properly adopted to meet it, seems to accord with the opinions which have prevailed in the subsequent cases. In Fisher, q. t. r. Beasley, Doug. *235. J. . borrowed 1004. of the defendant, for which he gave a bond, payable with ' legal interest at the end of six months, and also paid two guineas as a premium at rile time when the money was advanced. At the end of six months the capital was repaid, with 24.10s. for interest; and the Court were of opinion, that the offence was not complete till the half year's interest was received. In Maddock, q. t. v. Hammett, 7 T. R. 184. in an action for taking usurious discount on a note of 10004. it appeared that that note was discharged by giving another, stiH outstanding and unsatisfied. Buller, J. was of opinion at the trial, that the offence charged was not complete, for that, in order to constitute usury, there must be an usurious taking either > if money or money's worth; whereas nothing had been taken by the defendants but only the note, which at present only gave them a right of action, and perhaps might never be paid; which opinion, upon an application for a new trial, was confirmed by the Court. Upon a loan of5004. the borrower agreed to give something more than legal interest as a compensation, but no- particular sum was agreed upon. After the execution of the securities and payment of the money, the parties went to another place, where 604. was given as a compensation, and interest at 5 per Cent, on the 4004 was paid for several yean. Such interest was adjudged usurious, in ss much as the loan could only be deemed a loan of 4504.—Scurry, q. t. r. Freeman, 2.B4P. 381. So it was held in Wade, q. t. v. Wilson, 1 East. 195, that where a premium Was given at the time of the loan, and at the end of half a year interest was received (pa interest) for the money lent, the usury was complete when the half year's interest was received.

An action for usury, like all other penal action, must, by Stat. 21 James I. c. 4. be brought in the proper county. In the before-mentioned case of Scurry, q. t. u Freeman, 2 Be. n. 341, a draft was given to the defendant for the interest in Middle-set, sod received by him as cash, hut afterwards exchanged by him for money with a third person in London, the Court of C« B. ruled, that the venue was properly laid in London, as the draft was merely a promise to pay, and the actual receipt of the money and taking the usury was in London, where rents were received in Middlesex, but the balance was settled in London, the venue was held to be well laid there; and A shunt, J. seemed to think it might have been laid in either county—Scott, q. t, v. Brett, 2 T. R. 238. Qu. if the same opinion might not hold good in Scurry v. Freeman, and the draft be considered as money's worth received in Middlesex; it would often be impossible to shew where a draft had been actually passed away for value to a third person.

In 1 Hawk. c. 82. s. 24, it is laid down, that in pleading an usurious contract, by way of bar to an action, you must set forth the whole matter, especially because it lay within your own privity; but that in an information on the statute for making such a contract it is sufficient to set forth the corrupt bargain generally, because matters of this kind are supposed to be privately transacted, and such information may be brought by a stranger—see also to the same effect Bedo v.

No. I. xtporter properly states in the marginal abstract, as the result of the cate, the general, VTTT conclusion, that a bona fids debt is not discharged by being mingled with an usurious 37 VUI4 contract relating to it; and see Phillips «• Cockayne, 3 Campb. 119—Ferral a. Sheen, C* 9. 1 Saund. 292.

In Daniel 0. Cartony, 1 Esp. 274, Lord Kenyon held, that a bill good in its inception was not avoided in the hands of a bona fids indorsee by an intermediate usurious transaction; and where a valid bill was indorsed by A. the payee upon an usurious consideration to B. who indorsed it for a valid consideration to G* who in-dossed it to B/s assignees in payment of a debt, such assignees were held to have a good title to the bill, being clothed with the equity of C.—Parr t.Eliason, 1 East. 92-Notes were discounted by Plank to the defendant the drawer upon an usurious consideration and paid to the plaintiff a bona fide indonee. He and the defendant, upon application for payment, gave hit hood for the amount—the defendant pleaded that the bond was given for securing monty lent upon an usurious contract between Plank and the Defendant, to which the Plaintiff replied, that the bond was given for n just and lawful debt, and not, dec. A verdict was given for the Plaintiff; and the Court were of opinion, that the bond was valid; but it was admitted, that if one security be substituted for another by the parties in order to get rid of the statute, rile substituted as well as the origioal security would be void—Cuthbert 0. Haley, 8 T. R. 390; and vide EUia 0. Warnes, Moore 752, Cro. Jac. 32. Yelv. 47. in which Warner, being indebted to Alder in 100J. gave him an usurious bond for 301. per cent, interest; and, by way of discharging the principal, became joint obligee with Alder in a bond for the payment of a debt of lOfM. due from Alder to the Plaintiff and it was held, than the usury did not vitiate that security.

And where the acceptor of a bill, drawn in pursuance of an usurious contract, accepted a second bill for the purpose of raising money to take up the former, and the second bill was discounted by a bona fide indorsee at the legal rate of interest, it was ruled by Lord EUenborough, that the second bill was not affected by the usury which attended the formation of the first—Dagnall 0. Wylie, Campb. 33.

Where a bond given for the performance of an usurious contract was annulled, a fresh bond taken for the principal and interest, after deducting the payments illegally made on the former contract, were ruled by Lawrence, J. to be valid—Wright 0. Wheeler, 1 Campb. 165. n—and in Barnes r. Hedley, 2 Taunt. 134. where an usurious contract was entered into, and securities given for the performance, and several payments made on the footing thereof, and the parties afterwards stated a fair account of principal and interest, and the borrower promised to pay the balance, whereupon the securities were cancelled, the promise was adjudged to create a legal debt. See Dagnall 0. Wigley, 11 East. 43. in which accommodation bills were held not to be void in the hands of a fair indorsee, in consequence of an undemanding that a broker should have an illegal commission upon discounting them.

In assumpsit if it appear either upon the evidence or from the plaintiffs exprem ' shewing in his declaration, that die contract was usurious, he cannot recover. But a

specialty cannot be avoided by usury appearing in evidence, or on the face of the condition, but it must be pleaded—1 Hawk. c. 82. s. 20. and the cates there cited; and see as to the particularity required in such pleading the parage already cited. Owes In Equity Although a Court of Equity will not, in general, relieve against an usurious con-ifipecting tract, except upon the terms of paying the principal with legal interest, the Master

.Usury. of the Rolls in Barnard 0. Young, 17 Vesey 44. (already cited upon other points)

sustained a suit by the aarignees of a bankrupt for delivering up an assignment of V stock founded upon a contract which he held to be usurious, observing, that if the

assignment was usurious, the consequence must follow that it is wholly void.—The r party in whose favour an usurious contract has been executed, cannot make use of it

.* for any purpose whatsoever. The other party does not seek relief to have that

contract cancelled, or other relief direedy against it, but only to enforce his own, right, contending that it is not to be impeded by having this usurious contract set up

to obstruct it.

- Where securities had been given for legal interest and more was afterwards received by taking advantage of the neceaitous circumstances of the borrowers:upon A suit for redemption, the account was directed to be taken upon the principle of applying the payments beyond legal interest in satisfaction of the principal, and is Case the lender was overpaid, that he should refund; Lord Talbot said, he did not determine how it would be if all the securities were delivered up—Bosanquet 0. pash wood, Temp. Talb. 37; and as to relief in equity upon payment of principal and legal interest—See Henkle 0. Royal Exchange Comp 1 Ves. 319—Scott v. Nesbitt, 2 Bro. Ch. 341—Benfield v, Solomons, 9 Yes. jun. 84. In Scott 0. Nesbitt, the relief was applied in taking an account of debts and assets before the master, the plaintiffe having recovered judgment at law upon an usurious bond. But a Bill in

Class V.]

Utury.

Equity requiring a discovery in usury, is generally demurrable to, as tending to subject the defendant to penalties; as to which see Chauncey v. Tahourden, 2 Atk. 322 —Anon. 2 Eq. Ab. 70, pi. 7—Harrison v. Southcote, 1 Atk. 539.

In cases of bankruptcy if usury is made out, the security is cut down altogether, not leaving, the party a creditor for that for which it was actually advanced. Per Lord Eldon, Beaufield t. Solomons, 9 Ves. 84. And this may be taken for granted from the case above cited, of Barnes ». Hedley, which was an issue directed by the Lord Chancellor to try whether the bankrupt to whom usurious securities had been given and afterwards destroyed, was indebted to Webb.

In ex parte Savener, 3 Vesey and Beames 14, the Lord Chancellor said, " Upon the notion of the equitable jurisdiction in bankruptcy we go much farther than Courts either of Law or Equity: at law you must make out the charge of usury, and in equity you cannot come for relief without offering to pay what is really due, and must either prove the usury by legal evidence, or have the confession of the party; but in bankruptcy it has been considered sufficient to suggest usury in a petition supported by affidavits merely upon information and belief, putting the party to prove against himself, for the purpose not of giving him his real debt, but of cutting him off from all relief. It is, 1 admit, now too late to alter that/ '

In Edmonson v. Popkin, 1 B. and P. 270, the Court o? Common Pleas set aside a warrant of attorney and judgment upon an allegation of usury, *as they were not to decide the question of usury in a summary way, and in order that the question of usury might be tried, which would be shut out if the judgment was allowed to stand —but the case passed without discussion as to the question of the judgment standing as a security for principal and legal interest, and in Hindle v. O'Brien, I Taunt. 413, upon a similar application the Court directed the money levied to be paid into Court, and referred it to the prothonotary to take an account of all matters between the parties, and to compute principal and legal interest. Lawrence, J. concurred in this opinion upon the ground of the defendant having paid part of the money, and intimated, that if the defendant had applied upon the first giving the warrant of attorney he would have been entitled to have set it aside, but it is very difficult to discern any reacon for this distinction, and the other judges (Heath and Chambre) decided the case upon the general principle, that as the application was to the equitable jurisdiction of the Court, the party applying must do what is equitable, and that if he applies to the equity of the Court he waves their legal jurisdiction.

In Fitzroy v. Gwillim, 1 T. R. 153, it was ruled, that the plaintiff could not maintain trover for a pledge given to secure an usurious loon without first tendering the principal and legal interest, it being deemed an equitable action.

In Tomkins r. Burnet, 1 Salk. 22, at N. P. before C. J. Treby, it was held, that a party could not maintain an action for money had and received, to recover what had been paid upon an usurious contract, and the case is reported as being decided upon the ground of his being partieeps criminis and# that volenti turn Jit injuria, but it is evident upon the whole of the report, that the money borrowed had not been repaid.—Lord Mansfield in Clarke v. Shee, Cowp. 200, said that the case of Tomkins v, Burnet has been long exploded, and in Smith v. Bromley, Doug. 697, n. Lord M. said, that so far as principal and interest went, the debtor was bound in natural justice to pay and therefore could not recover it back, but for all above legal interest equity would assist the debtor, or an action would lie to recover back the surplus if the whole had been paid; and he distinguished between a violation of the laws of public policy, and laws calculated for the protection of the subject against oppression and fraud.

The case of Astley r. Reynolds, 2 Str. 915, in which a party who had been compiled to pay more than legal interest upon the redemption of a pledge, was allowed to recover it back, is sometimes cited upon this subject, but is not very applicable, as in that case there does not appear to have been any usurious agreement.

Contracts for payment of compound interest are not illegal so as to be affected by Qf Compound the Statute of Usury, but are relieved against it in equity as being oppressive. Thus interest, in the case of Sir Thomas Meexs, cited by Lord Talbot in Bosanquet v, Dashwood,

Rep. Temp. Talbot 37, a covenant was inserted in s mortgage, that if interest was «ot paid punctually at the day, it should from that time, and so from time to time, be converted into principal, the Lord Chancellor relieved against the covenant as unjust and oppressive.—So in Broadway's case, Broadway v. Morecraft, Mosely 247 —in Lord Ossulston v. Lord Yarmouth, 2 Salk. 449. Lord Cowper held the clause to be void and of no use, and said to make interest principal, it is requisite that interest be first grown due, and then an agreement concerning it may make it princi-paL Lord Talbot said, that the reason is because all these cases carry somewhat of fraud with them, not such a fraud as is properly deceit, but such proceedings as lay

ex parte Bevan, as to settling accounts at the end of six months and carrying on interest, and the observation as to mercantile transactions where there is no agreement to lend, but they stipulate for mutual transactions, each making advances. Lord Eldon says, he admits that cannot be applied to a real security, and you may not when the debt comes to a certain sum take a real security and 51. per cent. I do not conceive that when any debt is ascertained as due for principal and interest, it was his Lordship* intention to lay down, that a valid ag cement could not be entered into for a valid security for the whole with intereat thereon. In looking at the cases in which agreements for compound interest are relieved against as oppieo* ive, if the question be asked wherein the oppression consists ? the tree answer seems to be, in compelling the borrower who has broken his engagement, to place the lender in the same situation aa if he had performed it; as the lender may pomibly have been obliged to borrow at interest the amount he was entitled to receive, and have incurred the actual expense of paying that compound interest which he has, at least, been wrongfully prevented from acquiring; and k ia very familiar in Courts of Equity to order rests in taking an account where there has been any breach of com* fidentm duty, I conceive m case of fraud.

In the late case of Tarieton v. Backhouse, Coop. 231, the contract was for the sale of a partnership interest for 40,0001. to be paid with interest by instalments, the interest at 51. per cent, on such puts thereof as should from year to year remain due to be added to the principal, and the several yearly payments were computed and bonds given for the same accordingly. The case was argued on the ground of the transaction being not a loan but a sate. The Lord Chancellor was of opinion, u that as the defendant might at the end of every year have brought an action and have had judgment for the principal and interest then due on the bonds, in equity the bonds could not be affected with usury, as the sum might be considered as having been called in and the instalments paid." It is obvious that this reasoning which 1 consider to be perfectly just in principle, would (authority out of the qttea* thm) extend to all conti am for the payment of compound interest on loans.

In several cases before Redesdale, as Lord Chancellor of Ireland, relief was given against leases granted by the borrowers to the lenders of money, and which in that country appears to have been a frequent practice, and the subject is familiarly described by the exprewon of lease and loon. See Browne r. O’Dea, 1 and L11S

218, though a lease for 999 years be made at the full value.—See also the following cases which are subsequent to Lord Redesdale’s resignation, and in which the inclination of the Court is against extending the doetrine in question.

It does not foil within the object of this note to enter into a discussion of the construction or effect of contracts with respect to interest, but I will take the liberty of so far transgressing the limits of my proper subject ss to advert to the question of allowing interest upon simple contracts without express stipulation. I certainly remember many cases in which juries have been supported in giving interest by way of damages for the detention of the debt, and the case of Holdepp v. Otway, 2 Saund. 102, seems a strong authority upon the subject. In a case of Wrigley r. 9eddon, for the salary of a curate, tried before Buller, J. at Lancaster^ Match Aa* sixes, 1790, 1 distinctly remember the jury giving a verdict for interest upon the recommendation of the Judge, and in the ease of the Huddersfield Canal Compare r. Buckley, 7 T. R. 36, where the defendant paid into Court the amount of the call which he waa Bible to, without interest, and the decision was in hit favour upon foe principal points in question, so that the question of interest, which only amounted to lOi. became merely what is called a Norfolk groat, and the jury having given interest, the judgment was for the plaintiff for that amount, and Lord Kenyon said, There is no doubt but the jury may give interest, not m nomine as interest, but as damages for foe detention of the debt, for non performance of the contracts—I apprehend, fame-ever, that the opposite course of subsequent authorities to the contrary it so strong, that nothing less than the interposition of the legislature can avail, in restoring the power formerly exercised. It is to be lamented, that m establishing these authorities the case which has been list cited was not sufficiently adverted to.

In Trelawney r. Thomas, 1 H. B. 308, upon assumpsit for work and labour and money paid, the Court held that the-jury might, in their verdict, calculate interest on the money really advanced, but not on the damages for work, and labour. The leading case in support of the modern doctrine is Walker c. Constable, 1 B» and P. 306, in which the Court of Common Pleas upon the supposed authority of Motor *

Class V.) Umtf.

Me. Ferlan, 2 Bur. 1905, ruled, that in such action tha plaintiff could recover nothing but the net sum received, without internet. It ia clear, that Motet v, Me. Fer-Un contains nothing directly applicable to the immediate queadon, and only bean upon it as being a general exponrion of the libenlity of the principle* upon which that action depends. At a very early period after the decision of Walker t>. Constable, I took the opportunity of expressing my aentixnenta rejecting it in an essay in the action for looney had and received, p. 121, and aee Tappenden v. Randall, 2 B. and P. 467 —Hogan o. Page, 1 B. and P. 337.

In Mountford v. Willes, 2 B. and P. 337, the defendant by note iti writing, engaged to be answerable for goods fiintiahed to a third person at the bottom of the note was written u Credit rill Christmas, * and the Court held the plaintiff entitled to interest from the time mentioned in the note. But in Gordon v. Swan, 12 East. 419, when goods were sold by contract in writing for a price payable at six months, and the jury upon a writ of inquiry declared their willingness to give interest aa well as princinal, the under sheriff directed them, that in point of law the plaintiff was not entitled to recover interest, and upon an application to set aside the inquisition. Lord EUenborough thought the contract only meant, that the vendee at all events should not be called upon for payment till the time given, but that it was still a contract for the sale of goods, and he thought the giving of interest should be confined to Bills of Exchange and such like instruments, and to agreements reserving interest, and the rule was refused. And in Calton r. Bragg, 15 East. 223, the Court of King’s Bench derided, upon very foil argument, that interest could not be recovered upon a simple contract for money lent, assuming such to be the established practice.— Lord EUenborough mid, that if the rule for allowing interest should be carried further than it had been, it mot be done by the legiriature j but where goods were sold upon an agreement to per by bill at a certain date, it was held that as interest would have run upon the biU if given, it might be recovered in an action for the price of the goods brought after the rime when the bill would have become due, Minchull v. Forte, 13 East. 98. It is a constant course m a Court of Equity upon giving relief in respect of money improperly obtained, to charge the defendant with interest, and certainly it is a very great hardship that a party who has improperly obtained the money of another, for which the only remedy ia at law, should be enabled to deprive the injured person from the fruits of his property for the whole rime that he can stave off the recovery of it.—See Jones v. Becker, 2 Camp. 428.—Poole v. Moult, East.

According to the ancient law of France, although contracts for interest were generally unlawfol as being usurious, interest was allowed by way of damages from the time of commencing judicial proceedings for tha recovery of the debt.

Annuities.

[No. I.] 17 George III. c. 26.—An Act for registering the Grants of Life Annuities; and for the better Protection of Infonts against such Grants.

* WHEREAS the pernicious practice of raising money by the sale of 17 Geo. Ilf.

* f T Life Annuities hath of late yean greatly increased, and is much c. 26.

4 promoted by the secrecy with which such transactions are conducted

Be it therefore enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty by .

• This Act has produced a greater number of judicial decisions than any other which has passed since the Statute of Frauds; and in proportion to the limited nature of the subject has been perhaps more the object of judicial examination than any other in the Statute Booh. The ostensible object of passing such an Act was the restraining impositions upon persons whose imprudence was supposed to render them an easy prev to others more designing j but the whole series of decisions which it has given rise to are distinguished by one leading characteristic feature, the attempt to invalidate deliberate contracts in consequence of some traskitfulneas or inaftVertence in endeavouring to comply with the formalities which it prescribes, and which formalities are stated in so vague and indistinct a manner, that it was impossible for any precaution to have adhered to them according to the judicial exposition which they have received:so that it might almost be supposed that the object of the framers had been to suppress and extinguish the contract entirely, not by direct pro hibition, but by involving it in difficu'ties, which no skill or prudence could overcome. The prejudice against this species of contract* might he abated by reflecting that few persons would be willing to advance their money by way of loan, depending for the repayment upon the duration of a more temporary interest, that it is always at the

option of a person entitled to property of such description to dispose of the 'property itself, if it is more beneficial to himadf, thaq/merely to subject it to a particular charge, that the competitors for obtaining property by annuity .would have reduced the general rate of purchase if-the advantages arising from such property were, (all circumstances considered) of such an .excenwe nature as- courts-of justice have sometimes supposed, and that the general inadequacy of the price, in proportion to the supposed actual value, has, in a great measure, arisen from the precariousness of the security in consequence of the difficulties in which it is entangled by the operation of the law. When some writers have reprobated this contract upon the ground that persona have refused to advance money upon undisputed security of fee-simple property, but have purchased an annuity out of the aame property, clearing above five per cent, after payment of insurance, they have done no more than shew that interest at five per cent, although the legal measure was not the actual value of the use of money to the party advancing it, not reflecting that a man has no more claim to the money of another than to his house or habitation, which may be sold or let upon such terms as may accord with the mutual convenience of the parties. The reputed proposer of the measure having long filled high and important situations, it

' Nor where an annuity bond is assigned to secure a smaller annuity to enrol the first bond— Hendenon v. Countess ofGlencairn, 2 Taunt. 235

In ex parte Chester, 4 T. R. 694. the Court of B. R. expressed an opinion, that only the particular deed, not truly set forth in the memorial, was vdd but in the Duke of Bolton v. Williams, 2 Vesey, jun. 138, 4 Bro. Ch. 310. Lord Loughborough held, that all the different parts made but one assurance, that the object was, that all the component parts should be set forth, and that a memorial that does not contain every assurance is not vilid. He intimeted, that upon inquiry the opinion of the Court of King's Bench was ex-prened with reference only to the mode of application for setting aside the securities.

In Hart o. Lovelace, 6 T.R. 471, Lord Kenyon said, I am not prepared to say whether or not' all the instruments given to secure an annuity must be set aside because one only is not properly registered. The cases upon the subject are not recondleable, but in the latest of them. Lord Loughborough, who drew the Annuity Act, ' decided, that if any of the deeds constituting the assurance for the annuity were not properly inrolled all the instruments were void. We are not called upon now to determine that point, but the atroog inclination of my opinion is, that any defect In the memorial of one of the deeds will vitiate the whole assurance.* '

The derisions in subsequent cases seem to take chit opinion for granted, and die reasons stated for it by Lord Loughborough are very strong; but I cannot forbear observing, that m many of the cases upon the subject the name of Lord Loughborough is adduced aa giving more weight to particular opinions than is consistent with the legitimate principles of judicial reasoning.

The construction of an Act of Parliament, as of any other instrument, is to be deduced Cram the language of the instrument itself, and not from any particular communications, aa to the objects or opinions of the individuals reported to have framed it, and which may not have accorded with the views of those who concurred in giving it validity by their assent, and nothing could he a pester extravagance than, in the administration of justice, to form one opinion upon the mere panted

of the instrument itself, and to act upon another from extrinsic considerations, and if these extrinsic circumstances cannot be fairly used in opposition to a given opinion, can they form any proper or legitimate ingredient in the support of it ?

The memorial must set out a warrant of attorney to confess judgment.—Davidson v. Lord Foley, 2H.B. 12*—Hopkins v. Waller, 4 T. XL 463.

It need not set out the judgment signed thereon.—Sherson v. Oxlade, 4 T. R. 824.

But the memorial of a bond by A. and B. may be explained by a subsequent part, setting forth a rdcital. of it as joint and several.—Coare v. Gib-lett, 3 East, 461.

It was held that the memorial must express^ that the obligor in a bond lAnds hit heirs, if such be the fact.—Harwood v. UnderhOl, 10 But, 123; so Purling v. Parkhurst, 2 Taunt. 237; and die omission is not cured by stating the condition, that if the grantor, his heirs, Ac. c. shall pay, &€. ibid.; and see Denne v. Dupuis, 11 East. 34. But the decision of Harwood v. Underhill has been since reversed in the Exchequer Chamber, 4.Taunt* 346.

A declaration in a deed, that no execution shall issue on a warrant of attorney, la not sufficiently described by stating a declaration that it was for better securing the annuity aa therein mentioned - —Cunningham v. Mackenxie, 2B»kP. 598, and aee Orton v. Knight, 3 B. & P. 153*.

It is sufficient to state aaasugnment of a salary "of so much per annum without stating how it arises.—Watts v. Millard, 5 T. R. 598

It is not necessary to mention the particular estates of all the grantors, if the estates in a county are charged, and so stated.—O’Callaghan v. Ingilby, 9 East, 135.

The trusts with respect to a lien on the estate, such as payment of taxes, need not to be stated.— Ibid.

A memorial of a demise of a term in trust for better securing the annuity, with such powers and in such manners as are particularly mentioned, ruled sufficient upon the face of it; it being, evident, that the party was a trustee for the Annuitant, and it not appearing that there was a trustee for any other, person.— Defaria v. Sturt, 2 Taunt. 225. Mansfield, C. J. said "Now leaving all the cases and arguments about this unfortunate act out of the case, let any one having read this deed be asked for whom there is a trustee."

A trust to permit the owner of the premises to receive the rents until default, and in case of default for sixty days, to raise the arrears, Ac. c. by sale or mortgage, is not sufficiently described by stating the party to be a trustee nominated on the part of the grantee.—Askew v. Makreth, Dom. Proc. N. R. 214. Nor by describing the deed as containing the usual powers of entry and distress. —DesEofans v. O’Bryen, 3 East, 559; and see Bradford v. Burland, 14 East, 445—Taylor ». Johnson, 8 T. R. 184.

It is not sufficient to state, that all the instruments were attested by A. B. C. and D. or one of them.—Hart t*. Lovelace, 6 T. R. 471.

A memorial, stating the deeds to be attested by A. B. C. and D. is insufficient if all of them are not attested by all those witnesses Fr part* Mackreth, 2 East. 563,

But if a dsed betwetn A. B, and C. is stated to be executed by A. and C. in the presence of E. and F. it is no objection, that it was also executed by B. in the pretence of those wire amen for it is not necessary to specify what signatures the witnesses respectively attested.—Orton v. Knight, 3 B. A P. 153.

The omission of the Christian name of one of the witnesses, as attesting one of the instruments, does not defeat the annuity, the name being truly stated as to the attestation of the other inttru-mefics.—Watt* |v.

The sum paid for a former annuity, not registered, but renewed from time to time, with a further turn given for a further annuity, may be sated as an entire sum.—Symmans tr. Mortimer, 5 T. R. 139.

When part of the consideration is the giving up a former annuity, it cannot be stated as money. Wasbum v. Birch, 5 T. R. 473.

Neither can money previously lent upon promissory notes which were given up.—Kirkman w. Price, 1 H. B. 309.

Ruled that a memorial of payment to A. B. and C. some or one of them, is void.—Vaux v. An-aeH, 1 B. & P. 224.

The necessity of stating to whom the payment was made is in this esse taken for granted.

The deed must express by whom the consideration was paid, but not the memorial per Eyre* Ch. J. ex parte -\nsell, 1 B. Sc P. 63. The contrary is laid down by Lord Loughborough, in Williams and the Duke of Bolton, 2 Vesey, jun. 152. See Crauford v. Philips, post 111.

It is sufficient if the consideration is stated by way of recital.—Sowerby v. Harris, 4 T. R. 494. —Hodges v. Money, 4 T. R. 500.

The consideration need only be stated once in the memorial, although mentioned in all the deeds.—Hodges v. Money, 4 T. R. 500.

It is not necessary to state the nominal consideration of ten shillings.—Ince v. Everard, 0 T. R. 545.

It is in respect of its forming a part of the consideration that an agreement for the redemption of the annuity must be slated.—Steadman v. Purchase, 6 T. R. 737.

to borrow money upon the same terms, the same deeds should be given as a security; and upon an advance of money, the deeds were given accordingly, without fresh inrplment: the court directed them to be cancelled.—Hammond v. Foster,

5 T. R. 635.

If a correct memorial be incorrectly inrolled, and the officers afterwards rectify the same before any proceeding had, the court finding the inrol-ment right will not inquire further.—Gairick r. Williams, 3 Taunt. 540.

III. The third Section requires the Deeds to set forth the Consideration j and by whom paid, that the Contention shall be in Money only.

For the manner of stating the consideration see the preceding cases respecting the memorial.

If the consideration is paid by an agent of the grantee, it must be so stated—Dalmer v. Barnard, 7 T. R. 248.

So by a banker's clerk—Askew Macreth, 1 N. R. 214. Doms- Proc.

It is sufficient if the fact appears by the receipt indorsed on the deed—Philips v, Crauford, 9 Ves. 214. 13 Ves. 517.

It is not necessary to state the name of the agent who receives the money—Crauford v. Philips, 2 N.R. 141.

Nor the time when, the payment was made— Coare v. Giblett, 4 East. 83—Philips v. Crauford, 9 Ves. 214. 13 Ves. 475.

But in these cases the day of payment to the grantor's agent was in fact stated.

" If indeed any matter had been agreed upon by which payment of the consideration was to be delayed to the disadvantage of the grantor, 1 should not have thought the consideration fully and truly stated"—per Chambre, i. in Crauford v. Philips.

If there be a "bond and warrant of attorney it is sufficient to state the consideration in the bond —Hodges v. Money, 4 T. R.

A» to the Sufficiency ^Consideration.— Notwithstanding the enactment that the consideration shall be as money only, it is not necessary that it shall be paid in moniei numbered.

Money paid for the redemption of a former annuity ts a sufficient consideration—ex parte Fallon and Wife, 5 T. R. 283.

The exemption as to stock relates only to stock actually transferred, and not an authority by a person entided to dividends for life, for trustees to apply them in payment of an annuity—Hud* .son v. Skinner, 6 T. R. 596—Duff v. Atkinson, % Vesey, 577.

V. Of the Invalidity arising from s Non-compliance with the Act.

In Croesley «. Arkwright, 2 T. R. 603. it was ruled, that an annuity affected by the Act was absolutely void; and that upon an execution against a person to whom goods had been assigned in consideration of such an annuity, the Sheiiff might return nulla bona.

One point of the decision was, that the grantor of the annuity having subsequently to the plaintifFe execution taken the same goods in execution, had neglected to vacate the annuity, supposing it only voidable by the parties.

The invalidity of the particular annuity was taken for granted; but there may be considerable room for doubting upon subsequent determinations, whether it was really a case within the Act.

An execution for an annuity void under the Act set aside upon the application of a creditor,

able loss. For this reason the legislature required, that the consideration should be in money and not in goods. But it is not necessary, nor was it ever intended that the money should be actually told down at the time of the grant. If it be a bona fide transaction, and the money be really paid to the grantor, or to his use, it satisfies the words and meaning of the Act.

having a subsequent execution—Saunders e» 'Haidinge, 5 T. R. 9.

An annuity void under the Act is not a forfeiture of a life interest, granted upon condition not to charge or incumber k.—Dens. den. Dolman v. Dolman, 5 T. R. 641.

VI. Proceedings to set aside Annuities.

1. At Lew.

The power, in Section 4, of applying to the Court for the deeds to be cancelled, is confined to the grantor, and does not extend to an assignee of the premises subject to the annuity, although the deed may be void—Garrood v. Sanders, 6 T. R.403.

The power is confined to cases where an action is brought. It does not apply to defects by reason whereof the annuity is void under the fira section—Sytnonds and Ux v. Cobourne, 1 B. A P. 482.

Whether the Court will for such defect stay proceedings or put the defendant to plead the circumstance—Qu. ibid.

The Courts under tjieir general jurisdiction will take cognisance of a warrant of attorney to confess judgment for an annuity void under the Act, and direct it to be cancelled ex parte Chester, 1 T. R. 694. and see note 1 B. & P. 66; but will not set aside the other deeds, ex parte Chester, ibid.

But the levying a fine does not give jurisdiction to the Court of Common Pleas—Crauford r* Caines, 2 H. B. 438.

The clause only relates to such judgments on warrants of attorney as were intended to be part of the security, and- does not extend to cates where judgment is obtained in the ordinary course of law on any instrument given for securing the same—Buck v. Tyte, 7 T. R. 495.

Therefore after verdict and judgment on mr ett factum the application for summary relief it too late --’ibid.

After judgment upon warrant of attorney, elegit and verdict in ejectment on application is too late, the defendant should have made his stand upon the ejectment.—Widey v. Woolley, 7 T. R. 540.

A rule for setting aside the annuity luring been discharged on the merits a new application will not be entertained upon the same statement of facta, although upon a different objection— Greathead v. Bromley, 7 T. R. 455.

Nor upon another fact not proved on the former application—Schumann v. Weatherhead* 1* East, 537.

Annuity not set aside for a clerical error in the term assigned—Ince v. Everard, 6 T. R. 545. So where the true consideration was stated to be

and in case the same shall not be fully and trnly set forth and described9 No. I.

every such deed instrument or other assurance shall be null and void to ill

IV. And be it further enacted, That if any part of the consideration c* shall be returned to the person advancing the same (l.t; or, in case the .

consideration or any part of it is paid in notes, if any of the notes with the |f Part of privity and consent of the person advancing the same shall not be paid ^dotation be when due, or shall be cancelled or destroyed without being first paid; or if returned or any

Notes shall not be paid when due, &c.

2801. and afterwards by mistake wMeh turn of 230L was paid, &c.—ibid.

The Court will not after the death of the grantee set aside an annuity upon a statement of frets which he might have contradicted if living— Haynes v. Hare, 1 H. B. 659; and see er parU Maxwell, 2 East. 85. So after the death or imbecility of the agent who negodated the trainee* tkm, and could alone speak to the facts, the annuity being paid during his life—Poole a. Cabanes, 8T.R.328.

<Ssnu where the defects appeared on the face of the instruments, as where only some of the deeds were attested by the witnesses mentioned in the memorial—Ex parte Mac Reth, 2 East. 563* So upon a warrant of attorney when aU the deeds are not stated in the memorial—Van Braam v. Isaacs, 1 ft. ft P. 451.

And there is no limitation of time for the apgication, and the Court have no discretion—Van raam v. Isncs, at ports Mac Reth.

The objections to the annuity must be stated in the rede nitu—Beg. Gen. B. R. T. 42 G. 3. 2 East, 569.

Where upon the execution of an annuity bond by three out of several obligors, the grantee of the annuity paid the consideration-money to D. . one of the three, who immediately paid it into a banker's in the names of himself and T. L. the attorney who acted for aU parties, sod took the banker’s receipt for the money in the names of himself and T. L. which was done in consequence of the other obligors not attending to execute the bond, it being agreed by the parties then present that until the securities should be executed the money should remain in the bands of a banker, and afterwards, upon the execution of the securities, the money was paid at the banker's with the authority of T. L. toD. ., and upon debt brought by the executors of the grantee on the annuity bond, the condition of which, on oyer, stated that the grantee paid the money to the obligors, and the memorial stated that the money was paid to D. . to the use of himself and the other obligors by the grantee: Held, that a plea alleging that in the assurances the consideration-money was stated to be paid by the grantee, and that it was not stated in the assurances that the sum was advanced by any agent or agents of the grantee, and that the same was advanced on behalf of the grantee by T. L. and D. . was to be taken as pleaded with reference to the Annuity-act, 17 Geo. 3. c. 26.; and that it raised an objection which was sustained by the frets, and invalidated the hood—Norwood v. Underbill, 3M.&. 82.

2. In Equity.

A Court of Equity will entertain jurisdiction to set aside an annuity for legal objections founded on the Act—.Byne v. Vivian, 5 Vesey, 604— Byne v. Potter, 5 Vesey, 609. before the Lord Chancellor—Bromley v. Holland, 5 Vesey, 610 —7 Vesey, 3—Coop. 9. In this last case the principle of jurisdiction was much doubted, and the decision referred to the authority of preceding cases—Underhill «. Horwood, 10 Vesey, 209—Ware v. Horwood, . C. by Revivor 14 Ves. 28. In that case the Lord Chancellor thought the principle correct.

The jurisdiction was exercised in Bromley v. Holland after two unsuccessful applications to the summary jurisdiction of a court of law.

The application was on a different ground, end the Master of the Rolls said, The plaintiff shall not now avail himself of any objection that was the ground of the application to the King’s Bench."—(Sed. Qu.)

He also expressed an opinion, which it evidently correct, that the refusal of a summary application to set aside 'die annuity would not be any objection to the same ground bring taken again whenever it was -endeavoured to enforce it.

VII. The Consequences of Invalidating an Annuity.

The terms of setting aside an annuity in equity are the talcing an account of the consideration paid for the purchase with interest at five per cent., deducting the payments from time to time taade, which are to be applied in the first place in discharge of the interest and then of the principal, and in case any thing upon taking such account is due from the grantor he is to pay it to the grantee or his Assignee—Bromley v. Holland, 7 Ves. 29.

And this is the coune adopted in setting aside annuities upon summary applications to courts of law.

Premiums of insurance on the life not allowed —ex parte Shaw, 5 Vesey, 620.

Allowed under special circumstances, the Bill offering to pay any fair and reasonable demands, and the insurance having been proposed by the grantor in a letter as a -reasonable term—Hoffman v. Cooke, 5 Ves. 623.

If the balance of account is against the grantor it cannot be recovered—Bromley v. Holland, 7 Ves. 29.

An annuity being vacated for non-conformity with the Act, the purchase-money may be reco-covered back in an action for money had and received—Shore v. Webb, 1 T. R. 732.

the consideration or any part of it is paid in goods; or if any part of the consideration is retained (9.) on pretence of answering the future payments of the annuity or any other pretence; in all and every of the aforesaid cases it shall and may be lawful for the person by whom the annuity or rent-charge is made payable to apply to the court in which any action is brought for payment of the annuity on judgment entered, by mo1 ion, to stay proceedings on the judgment or action; and if it shall appear to the court that such practices as aforesaid or any of them have

Qu. As to this form of action when part of the consideration is an antecedent debt for goods sold —ibid.

A mere surety for the annuity is not liable to this action, although he has signed a receipt for the money—Straton v. Rastall, 2 T. R. 366.

The action may be maintained if the grantor has procured the Warrant of Attorney to be set aside on motioo, though the other securities remain, Scurfield v. Gowland, 6 East, 241; or if even the grantor has dissented from the annuity and refused to pay it on the ground of its invalidity —Waters t. Mansell, 3 Taunt. 56.

The payments may be set-off—Hicks v. Hicks, 3 East, 16; although made above sis yean before, the Statute of Limitations not being replied—ibid.

Qu. If it is replied.

Qu. As to allowing a computation of interest, interest not being usually allowed in actions for money had and received.

Lord Eldon in Jones v. Harris, 9 Ves. 492, says, that the general opinion at the time when the Act was passed was, that if a proper memorial was not registered the grantee should neither have his annuity or the money back, the Act meaning to put an end to such transactions. That would have been a much wiser course than that which has prevailed in later cases, for it is a mockery to say that a man shall be relieved upon such terms. In genera], persons who are under the necessity of raising money in this way would not dare to take the objection under the Act, when the consequence would be an immediate execution.

The effect therefore of these decisions that the consideration may be recovered back with interest

instead of (he protection intended by the Act to increase the evil. He proceeds to add, that the conn ary is settled by authority.

Previous to these observations being promulgated from the Bench, the liability to refund bad been the subject of opposite opinions in Mr. Powell's Essay on the Law of Contracts, and Mr. Plowden’s Treatise on Annuities.—The opinions of the former gentleman being in favour of the right of repet tion, and the latter in opposition to it. The present Editor, in endeavouring to illustrate the general nature of a right of repetition, in an E<say submitted to the public, on the acion lor money had and received, took the opportunity of expressing his own ideas upon the subject, and, in conformity with those principles of jurisprudence which he has often endeavoured, however unsuccessfully, to promote, took occasion to observe, in answer to the arguments of Mr. Plowden, that " a great part of his reasoning will be answered, by admitting, that a man who has neglected to take the measures prescribed by law for securing his annuity, dr to speak more correctly, who has fallen into some mistake in endeavouring to comply with the requisites of the lew, shall eat be allowed, in the first instance, to adduce fan oaa neglect or mistake as a ground of prejudice agam* the opposite party; he shall not allege, that m consequence of a blunder in the registry he wffl no longer receive his annuity, but reclaim his principal, any more than a person who has made a fraudulent insurance, mall come in the first instance, and shewing, that by his own fraud the policy was void, insist upon the premium being retained; but when the other party has taken advantage of the invalidity of the contract, has found out some formal technical objection, and refused, in consequence, to adhere to his engagement, can it be contended that be has any right, in point of natural justice, to retain the money that he received for a purpose which he refuses to execute ? By the protection of the law he dull not be placed in a situation which he considers less advantageous than if hit engagements had not been made; but shall he be therefore enabled to pot himself in a better situation, than if there had been no engagement at all, by the amount of the money which he wishes to retain ? He shall nor be injured; but shall he, therefore, be allowed to defraud? And as to any supposed agreement of not reclaiming the principle is an Pisenrial pert of the supposition, that the annuity will be duly paid; it is blowing hot and cold to adopt one part of the supposition and reject the other. If the grantee of the annuity does not properly provide for its security, let the grantor avail himself of positive law and avoid it; hut let him not, at the same time, retain the purchase-money and withhold the security; more especially, let noc the the conduct of the man who requires to be paid either the one or the other, who only carter de damno vitando against the other, qui eertat da lucre captando be the object of reproach/’ Reviewing these observations, after an interval of thirteen years, he is happy in retaining his preference to the principles which have been established by the authority of judicial decisions, over the incidental observations by which they have been assailed; feeling that if the object of the legislature waa to abolish the contract under consideration, it would have been more consistent to have given that intention its full and proper effect, by at once attaching illegality to the substance of the contract, and precluding the repetition of mone£ paid as the consideration of it, than under the pretext of regulation and publicity to have entangled it in a set of obscure and unintelligible formalities, deCivs VI.] jimuitiet.

V. And be it further enacted, That a particular roll shall be provided and kept by the clerks of the inrollment* in Chancery or their deputy, on which such memorials shall be entered, and that every such memorial shall he duly inrolled in order of time as the same shall be brought to the office; and the said clerks of the inrollments or their deputy shall specify upon the roll the certain day hour and time on which such memorial is brought to the office, and shall grant a certificate of the inroll-ment thereof when required; and that there shall be paid for the inroll-ment* of every such memorial the sum of one shilling and no more in case the same do not exceed two hundred words; but if such memorial shall exceed two hundred words, then after the rate and proportion i f sixpence for every hundred words and the like fees for every certificate ana copy given; and the fee of one shilling for every sfearch in the office and no more.

VI. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all contracts for the purchase of any annuity with any person being under the age of twenty-one years shall be and remain utterly void, any attempt to confirm the same after such person shall have attained the age of twenty-one years notwithstanding: And that if any person shall either in person by letter agent or otherwise howsoever procure engage solicit or ask any person being under the age of twenty-one years to grant or attempt to grant any annuity or rent-charge, or to execute any bond deed or other iu8trument for securing the same; or shall advance or procure or treat for any money to be advanced to any person under the age of twenty-one years upon consideration of any annuity or rent-charge to be secured or granted by such infont after he or she shall have attained his or her age of twenty-one years; or shall induce solicit or procure any infant upon any treaty or transaction for money advanced or to be advanced to make oath or to give his or her word of honour or solemn promise that he or she will not plead infancy or make any other defence against the demand of any such annuity or rent-charge or the repayment of the money advanced to him or her when under age; or that when he or she comes of age he or she will confirm or ratify or in any way substantiate such annuity or rent-charge; every such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and being thereof lawfully convicted in any court of assize oyer and terminer or general gaol delivery shall and may be punished for the said offence by fine imprisonment or other corporal punishment as the court Shall think fit to award.

VII. Of Assignments of Annuities.

In the case of the Duke of Bolton o. Williams, 2 Ves. jun. 138, (among many other points,) it was held by Lord Loughborough, than an assignment of an annuity is required to be registered as well as an original grant, hut this as a general question was not necessary to be decided, as the transaction related to the grant of an original annuity including the transfer of former annuities, and invalid on other grounds; and in Dixon «. Birch, 2 Hen. BL 307—Bromley v. Greathead, Hunt on Annuities, 188—-it was ruled and is now settled, that an alignment of an annuity is not within the Act.

(1.) A, an attorney, purchases an annuity of

B, and having paid the consideration-money, receives from B, the amount of a bill for business done, including by mistake, a charge for searches for incumbrances, which searches had never been made:Held, that the payment of this charge, so inadvertently made, was not a return of the consideration-money within the meaning of 17 Geo. 3. c. 26. s- 4.

WHEREAS by an Act of Parliament made and passed in the fifty-third year of the reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, 53 G. 3. c. 141. intituled An Act to repeal an Act of the Seventeenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled An Act for Registering the Grants ef Life Annuities, and for the better Protection of Infants against such GrantsJ and to substitute other provisions in lieu thereof, it is enacted, that within thirty days after the execution of every deed, bond, instrument, or other assurance, whereby any annuity or rent charge shall, from and after the passing of the said Act, be granted for one or more life or lives, or for any term of years or greater estate determinable on one or more life or lives, a memorial of the date of every such deed, bond, instrument, or other assurance of the names of all the parties, and of all the witnesses thereto, and of the person or persons for whose life or lives such annuity or rent charge shall be granted, and of the person or persons by whom the same is to be beneficially received, shall be enrolled in the High Court of Chancery, in the form or to the effect following, with such alterations therein as the nature and circumstances of any particular case may reasonably require: And whereas the form or effect to which such enactment refers is expressed in several columns, at the head of one of which are the words " Names of Witnesses, " and underneath, as applicable to indentures of lease and release, the letters and words " E. F. of" " G. H. of" and as applicable to a bond and warrant of attorney to confess judgment, the letters E. F " " G. H." without the word u ofAnd whereas the words of enactment referring to such form express only that a memorial of the names of all the witnesses to every such deed, bond, instalment, or other assurance as therein mentioned, should be enrolled as directed by the said Act, without providing that any description of the witnesses should be given in such memorial, except as such form, is thereby referred to; and such form does not provide that any description should be added to such names except by the addition of the word of" to the letters " E. F." and " G.

Class VI.] AmudHes*.

from the use of the word "of" after such letters "E. F.* and after such letters " G. H." as aforesaid, that it was necessary to describe each of such witnesses in such memorial as of some place, and in consequence thereof some grants of annuities made since the passing of the said Act have been, in proceedings in summary applications to courts of justice, which cannot be reviewed in any superior court, deemed null and void, on the ground that no description of the place of abode of the witnesses to some or one of the deeds instruments or assurances by which such grants of annuities have been made, had been inserted in the memorials or memorial thereof enrolled as directed by the said Act: And whereas doubts have been entertained whether the construction so put on the said Act is the true construction thereof, more especially as the same is so far penal as it renders deeds instruments and assurances, of which memorials have not been enrolled in pursuance of the smd Act, null and void, and the provisions in the said Act arc not so clear and explicit as the same ought to have been under such circumstances, and the parties churning under grants of annuities may have been thereby misled, and induced to conceive that it was not necessary under the provisions of the said Act to insert in the memorial of any deed instrument or assurance to be enrolled as aforesaid, the place or places of abode of the witness or witnesses to such deed instrument or assurance, or any more than the name or names of such witness or witnesses, there being no words in the said Act expressly requiring any more to be so inserted, nor any words from which it could be inferred that any more was required to be so inserted, except the word "oF* after the letters " E. F.* and " G. H." respectively, with reference to one species of assurance inserted in the form of memorial before mentioned; and it is expedient to remove all doubts touching the construction of the said Act, with respect to so much of the memorials required by the said Act to be enrolled as relates to any description of the witness or witnesses to any deed instrument or assurance: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted and declared, and be it enacted and declared by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That by the said Act of the fifty-third year of the reign of His said late Majesty, no further or other description of the subscribing witness or witnesses to any deed, bond, instrument, or other assurance, whereby any annuity or rent charge is or may be granted, is required in the me. moriul thereof, besides the names of all such witnesses; and so the said Act shall be deemed construed and taken.

II. And whereas doubts have also arisen, whether under the said Act of the filty-third year of the reign of His said late Majesty, the omission to enrol a memorial of any one of the assurances for securing any annuity or rent charge does not vitiate the whole transaction, notwithstanding the enrolment of a memorial of another deed, bond, instrument, or other assurance granting the same; and it is also expedient to remove such doubts: Be it therefore further enacted and declared, That every deed, bond, instrument, or other assurance granting any annuity or rent charge, and of which a memorial shall have been or shall be duly enrolled pursuant to the said Act, notwithstanding the omission to enrol any other deed, bond, instrument, or assurance for securing such annuity or rent charge, shall be valid and effectual, according to the intent meaning and true effect thereof, notwithstanding a memorial of any other deed, bond, instrument, or assurance for securing the same annuity shall not have been duly enrolled pursuant to the said Act.

111. Provided always, and be it further enacted, That nothing herein contained shall extend to give any other force or validity to any deed, bond, instrument, or other assurance of which a memorial shall have been duly enrolled as aforesaid, than such deed, bond, instrument, or other assurance would have had if any deed, bond, instrument, or other assurance for securing the same annuity, of which a memorial shall not have been duly enrolled, had never beep executed.

And for the better avoiding and preventing of all excessive and immoderate playing ami gaming lor the time to come, be it further ordained and enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons shall at any time or times after the nine-and-twentieth day of Scp~. ternber aforesaid, play at any of the said games or any other pastime game or games whatsoever (other than with and for ready money), or snail bet on the sides or hands of such as do or shall play thereat, (1.) and shall lose any sum or sums of money or other thing or things so played for exceeding the sum of one hundred pounds (2.) at any one time or meeting upon ticket or credit or otherwise, and shall not pay down the same at the time when he or they shall so lose the same, the party and parties who loseth or shall lose the said monies or other dung or things so played or to be played for above the said sum of one hundred pounds, shall not in that case be bound or compelled or compellable to pay or make good the same; hut the contract and contracts for the same and for every part thereof, and all and singular judgments statutes recognizances mortgages conveyances assurances bonds bills specialties promises covenants agreements and other acts deeds and securities whatsoever, which shall be obtained made given acknowledged or entered into for security or satisfaction of or for the same or any part thereof, shall be utterly void and of none effect: (3) And that the said person or persons so winning the said monies or other things shall forfeit and lose treble the value of all such sum and sums of money or other thing or things, which he shall so win gain obtain or acquire above the said sum of one hundred pounds; the one moiety thereof to our said Sovereign Lord the King bis heirs and successors; and the other moiety

(1.) In Pope v. St. Leger, 1 Silk 344— 4 Mod. 409—5 Mod. 4—1 Lutw. 484. it was ruled, that the statute did not extend to a bet, as to the proper manner <of playing at Backgammon —being not on the right of the play but on the chance of the play, which is collateral. But in Brown v. Lunn, 2 H. B. 43. Lord Loughborough refused to try a cause upon a wager, as to the Chances of the dice at Hasard—and ordered it to be struck out of the paper as being of a nature highly improper to be made the foundation of an action—with a proviso, that it should be restored in case the Court should be of a different opinion, and the Court refused an application for the cause to be restored. Gould, J. said, M The game of Hasard stands condemned by the law of England; there are many statutes which make it illegal, and nothing can be more injoriooe to the morals of the nation, than a public discussion of, this nature, before an audience whoee curiosity is excited to attend the time of such questions, the refusal, therefore, to try it, was both laudable and legal." Heath, J. " All games at Dice, exS* Backgammon, am prohibited by law, and I nk it would be vilifying and degrading Courts of Justice, if they Wore to allow, by means of a wager, a discussion on prohibited games." The counsel for the defeiuumt had urged, with respect to the case of Pope v. St. Leger, that the bet was concerning a legal game, Backgammon being excepted out of the Statutes, which prohibited other games at dice. The reporter properly notices, that that could not be die ground of the decision, as the exemption in favour of Backgammon wan first made by statute 15 Geo. 2* c. 19. sec. 9. (end which is only an exception from the particular provisions or that statute.) The summary decision in Brown v. Limn can hardly be sufficient to constitute a direct authority upon the mere question of law, with reaped to the proper method of playing at any game or chance, (supposing the question to be raised in e direct and regular manner,) in opposition to the express authority of Pope «. St. Leger.

(2.) There are several cases as to the application of this clause, where different sums exceeding in the whole 100/. were lost to different persons at the same time, or to the same person at AC, ferent times, and with respect to contracts being distinct, for which see Noel v.

But in Bowyer tr. Bampton, 2 Str. 1155. it was ruled, that the statute of Anne extends to render void bills and notes in the hands of an innocent indonee, and such is now the established law. The same was ruled with respect to btUa void for usury in Lowe v.

(4.) In Young v. Moore, 2 Wile. 67. it was insisted, that though the statute had made all writings and securities for money won at play void, that it had not made parol contracts for money won at play void, to this it was answered and resolved by the Court, that as the statute hath made all securities for money won at play void a fortion, all parol contracts of thia aort are void, and the court distinguished the case from that of Barjeau V. Walmaley, infra Note 7, on the ground of the latter being for money lent. It is observable, that thia provision as to avoiding the security makes no distinction between the gaming being for 10/. or lessand that by the express terms of the statute a security for money won by gaming, although leas than 10/. would be void. In Blaxton v. Pye, 2 Wils. 309. it vitas held, that upon a bet of 14/. against 8/. on a horse-race, no action could be maintained against the loser of 8/. as he would not have been entitled to receive the 14/. and that the contract was therefore nudum pactum, and the same was decided in Clayton i*. Jennings, 2 Bl. Rep. 706; And Lord Kenyon, referring to the cases of Blaxton v. Pye, in Good v. Elliott, 3 T. R. 706, said, that had the wager been within the limits allowed by the statutes, there is no doiibt but that it would have been held good; in Bulling v. Frost, 1 Esp. Cas. N. P. his Lordship held, that an action might' be maintained to recover the sum of 3/. 10s. lost at all-fours; and in McAllister v. Huden, 2 Campb. N. P. 438. it was ruled, by Lawrence, J. that an action might be maintained upon a wager for less than 10/. ou a horse-race. It seems, however, very doubt -fbl whether in any of these cases the present provisions of the statute was sufficiently adverted to; and whether the enactment, that all securities for money won by gaming should be void, ought not to be considered as vitiating all contracts for money so won, so far as affects the right of recovery, although the subsequent provision for recovering back money actually paid relates only to sums amounting to 10/. In the case of Young v. Moore, the action was for above 10/. and the question consequently did not arisebut see Note 7, past.

(5.) In Jeffereys v. Walter, 1 Wils. 220. the •Court of B. R. inclined to give Judgment for the defendant, that cricket was a game within the statute, but the case stood over and the parties agreed. In Goodbura v. Manley, 2 Str. 1159. it was held, that a wager on a horse-race wav a game within this Act, being mentioned in the Statute 16 Chat. II.; and in LynaU v. Longbottom, 2 Wills. 36. determined upon a different ground, it was said by Willis, J. in delivering the opinion of the Court, it is agreed on all hands that a footrace is a game within the Statute 9 Anne; and in Brown v. Berkeley, Cowp. 282. the court, upon the authority of that case, ruled a foot-race against time to be within the Act, and gave judgment for the defendant in an action of covenant upon such a wager. The case of Blaxton v. Pye, mentioned in the last note, and several other cases also, clearly treat bone-racing aa a game within the statute.

In Clayton v. Jennings, 2 Bl. Rep. 706. (referred to in the preceding note,) Aston, J. mentioned the case of Connor v. Guide, jo the King’s Bench about ten yean before, when the Court took a distinction between racing a hone for 501. which was lawful, and betting on the ride of a hone which was not so.—(But see the last note.)

In Johnson v. Burns, 4 T. R. i wager under 10/. upon a hone-race for less than 50ZL prohibited by Statute 13 G. 111. c. 19.) was ruled to be illegal. In Ximenes v. Jaques, 6 T. R. 499. judgment was arrested in an action on a wager for 100 guineas, that the plaintiff would perform a journey in a post-chaise and pair within a given time, but no reasons for the judgment were stated by the Court. In Whaley v. Pigot, 2 B.&P.5I. judgment was arrested in an action on n wager that a horse of the defendant should perform a journey in a less time than two bones of the plaintiff, to be placed on the road as the plaintiff should think proper. Lord Eldon, after generally noticing the provisions of the Statutes, 16 Charles II. and 9 Anne, said, "Hie 16 Chas. IL does not in terms avoid any contract—[which observation, however, is not correct, the second section making an express provision to that effect]— but the transaction on which the contract a founded being prohibited, the contract itself cannot be supported. The 9th of Anne expraaly avoids the contract—[but see the preceding note.] These statutes were followed by 13 Geo. II. c. 19. and 19 Geo. II. c. 34; but if many contracts founded in horse-racing have been held illegal previous to these statutes, it might be found difficult to maintain that such horse-racing could now be deemed legal which before had been deemed illegal. But the 13 Geo. II. having prohibited many species of horse-racing, the lew seems to have implied that such aperies of horse-racing as were not prohibited by that statute by not being prohibited became legal; and the 18th George II. having taken away some of the prohibitions and penalties of 13 Geo. II. the same kind of reasoning seems to have been applied, namely, that these species of racing, with respect to which certain restrictions were taken away, were thereby altogether legalised. There seems to be much ground for arguing from the nature of the 16th Charles II. and 9th Anne, that these Acta ought to be construed strictly, in order to enforce the principles on which they are founded, namely, to prohibit all horse-rachig $ and that the 13th and 18th of Geo. 11. are from their nature to be to construed as to encourage the breed of hones, and to permit that species of horse-racing only

called racing on the Turf. It is to be observed, that the 13 Geo. II. speaks of entering, placing, starting, Ac. c. and that the expression any place or places whatever, * used in 18 Geo. II. can hardly mean England and afterwards, on delivering the opinion of- the Court, his Lordship said, u Upon inquiry of the Judges of the Court of King’s Bench we find that the judgment of that Court in Ximenes v. Jaques, proceeded on an opinion, that the 13th and 18th Geo. II. relate to bona fid* hone-racing only; without, therefore, again entering into the grounds before stated, it is sufficient for me to declare it to be the opinion of the Court, that the transaction described in this case is not that species of horserace or match which ia legalised by 13 and 18 Geo. II. and consequently that this action cannot he maintained." By a note inserted in Mr. No-Ian's edition of 8trange to the case of Goodburn v. Manley, it appears that it was objected in that case, that inasmuch as a late statute was made against horse-racing, that was an argument that horse-racing was not published by any of the former laws, for if it were, this statute need not have been made; and, therefore, it was said it would not be within the Statute of the 9th of Anne; but to this it was answered by the Court, that though horse-racing might not be unlawful, yet betting at horse-races was so; and that the ute Act of Parliament speaks only of running of hones or horse-racing, but speaks nothing of betting at horse-races, which is the present case, and, therefore, that rule cannot anyways affect the present case.

I certainly cannot see any legitimate ground on which it could be held, that the Statute of 13th Geo. II. (the title and language of which are altogether prohibitory,) could be admitted to give validity to contracts, which, independently of those statutes, would be considered Illegal; and there seems to be much more weight in foe argument that foe express prohibition of such races, under particular circumstances, afforded evidence of their being considered as legal, independently ef those prohibitions, although certainly many Acta are paved which manifest a great want of attention to foe real purport and effect of preceding enactments. And in some of foe cases which have occurred the attention seems to have been rather directed to the inquiry, whether the statutes of Geo. 11. contained an exception to the

prohibitions assumed to be contained in the preceding statutes, than to foe question how far such prohibitions really attached, and it is very difficult to reconcile tome of foe cases with foe established doctrine as to foe general validity of wagen not affected by particular grounds of objection.

(6.) In an action for recovering money won on a bet, that J. C. could not run a certain distance In a given time, the Court directed a nonsuit— because it did not appear upon the statement of the case, that J. C. was playing at a game called a foot-race, and as it did not appear that he wan playing at any game, there could not be any betting on his ride.—Lynall v. Longbottom, 2lWi]La.36# '

(7.) la Barjeau a. Wahnatey, 2 Str. 1249, foe plaintiff and defendant gamed together at totting; up, and the plaintiff having won all foe defendant's money lent him ten guineas at a time and won it, till the defendant bad borrowed 120 guineas, and in an action to recover the money, Lee, C. J. held, that this was not a caw within the Act, for there is not the word contract, as in the Statute of Usury, and foe word Mncrftus, as it stands in the Act, must mean lasting securities upon foe estate. The Parliament (he said) might think there would be no great harm in a parol contract, where foe credit was not likely to run very high, and therefore confined the Act to written securities, wherefore the plaintiff obtained a verdict.

In Allanbrook v. Hall, 2 Wils.309, thede-fendant having lost above 101. upon a bet, at a hone-race, requested the plaintiff to pay it for him, which he did, and foe defendant objected, that this money being lost at gaming, and recoverable lack agtin by the Statute 9 Anne, foe action would not lie; hut the Court held, that this was not a case within the Statute, upon the ground stated in foe preceding caw, and gave judgment for foe plaintiff. In Robinson *, Bland, 2 Burr. 1077—1 BL 234, 256, it was ruled, that a Bill of Exchange given in France by one British subject to another, the consideration of which was partly money won at play, and partly money lent to play with, was void for the whole; but that the plaintiff might recover, on the common courts, the money font. The caw contains some important views with respect to the general question of the legality of a contract en^ tered into in a different country.

(8.) In Bower v. Booth, 2 Bl. Rep. 528, the Court held, that money won between Monday evening and Tuesday evening, the parties having been gaming without interruption, except for an hour when the parties were at dinner, without

Erring company, was won at one sitting. Per acksitone, J.—To lose 10L at one time is to lose it at a single stake or bet- To lose it at one sitting is to lose it in s course of play where the company never parts, though the person may not a be actually gaming the whole time; and by Gould and Nares—The Statute, with respect to the party losing, is remedial, not penal—although (by Nares) it is penal, where the action is brought by a common informer:—so by Gould, with respect to aproceeding on that branch of the Act which inflicts pillory or other corporal punishment.

Stock Jobbing.

[No. I.] 7 George II. c. 8.—An Act to prevent the infamous Practice of Stock Jobbing.

7 Geo. II. c.8. iy WHEREAS ft.) great inconveniences have arisen and do daily arise See Bur. 1 by the wicked nemicious and destructive practice of stock jobbing 20«9. whereby many of nis Majesty’s<good subjects have been and are di* verted from pursuing and exercising their lawful trades and vocations

* to the utter min of themselves and families to the great discouragement

* of industry and to the manifest detriment of trade and commerce:' For remedy thereof, may it please vour most excellent Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Loras Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the audioAll Contract* nty of the same. That all contracts and agreements whatsoever which made for u- shall from and after the first day of June one thousand seven hundred and berty thirty-four, be made or entered into by or between any person or persons

1anvPulH "bMsoever upon which any premium or consideration in the nature of a lick Stocks or Prcro‘ura shall be given or paid for liberty to put upon or to deliver Securities, and re*ve accept or refuse any publick or joint stuck or other publick seeu-Wagen, &c, rities (2.) whatsoever or any part share or interest therein, and also all shall be void, wagers and contracts in the nature of wagers and all contracts in the

&c. nature of putts and refusals relating to the then present or future price

or value of any such stock or securities as aforesaid shall be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever (3.) and all premiums sum or sums of money whatsoever which shall be given received paid or delivered upon all such contracts or agreements or upon any such wagers or contracts in the nature of wagers as aforesaid shall be restored and repaid to the person or persons who shall give pay or deliver the same.

(1.) This statute is a remedial rather than a penal Act. Billing a. Flight, 6 Taunt. 419. . C. 2 Marsh 124.

(2.) Omnium is a stock within the Act—Brown v. Turner, 7 T. R. 630.

(3.) The Statute does not extend to a contract on the loan or transfer of stock to replace the same amount on a future day—Saunders v. Kentish, 8 T. R. 162.—A broker contracting in his own name for the tale of stock which he was authorised to sell, and having, upon default of his principal, paid the difference between the price and the value at the time when the transfer was to be made, cannot maintain an action against the principal for money paid to his use, the plaintiff not having been bound as guarantee for the transfer of the stock.—Child v. Manby, 8 T. R. 610. —In Faikney v. Renoua, 4 Bur. 2069, the plaintiff and de'endant having been engaged in partnership in illegal stock transactions, the plaintiff paid 3000/. for compounding the difference, and the defendant gave him a bond -for a moiety of the money, which was holden good. And in

Petrie v. Hannay, 3 T. R. 418, one party in a similar transaction having paid the difference with the privity and consent of the ocher, who accepted a bill for the amount, was allowed to recover. Conformable however as these dfrienm are to the manifest principles of justice, they have net been allowed to maintain their authority, and cannot by any subtlety of reasoning be reconciled with the subsequent cases of Leahbyw. Steen, 6 T. R. 61—Brown v. Turner, 7 T.R. 639, which were decided in a much more summary manner than the magnitude and importance of the question required. But the King's Bench had then lost the powerful aid of a Buller.—The principles of these respective cases atM continue the sulqect ofiodkial controversy. The majority of opinions will probably be found in favour of the doctrine which has always appeared to me to be as uncalled for by the rules of law as it is cosh feasedly repugnant to the principles of justice.— See the subject more folly discussed in the Appendix, No. 1, and see class 3, No. 3, note I supra.

(4.) It is no ground for refusing to answer a bffi of discovery, filed in pursuance of 7 Geo. IL c. 8. s. 2. that the plaintiff has declared in assumpsit instead of debt. Billing v. Pulley* 2 Marsh 125, 91. . C. 6 Taunt. 422.

weadorwuhinuelf only intidedto the estate by virtue of sn agreement with the persona of whom lie had purchased it, and no conveyance had been made to him, or pom-ion taken, the statute 38 Henry VIII. applied. But the cue being decided in favour of the defendant on another ground, it became unnece—ary to consider the objection arising out of the statute.

It would certainly seem a perversion of the law to consider a case as failing within the statute upon the mere ground of the objection taken in the preceding case, where the possession was consistent with the vendor’s title, and the only defect was in the conveyance of the legal estate, of which the first vendor was, in the contemplation of courts of equity, a trustee for his vendee, the second vendor, ana was the person under whom such vendee claimed.

In Underwood v. Lord Courtown, 2 . & L. Lord Redesdale said, M A person out of possession cannot in law convey any thing to a stranger; he can give only a release to one in possession, and the law has wisely provided this in order to quiet fosse—ions." From the early statutes which I nave thought it eligible to introduce, it appears that the law upon this aubject was originally instituted upon the mast wise and salutary principles, and as a guard against that judicial corruption, the prevalence of which is rendered must apparent by the numerous provisions imdenied against it. Whether there is equal necessity for continuing such a law in the existing state ok the community is a question which may admit of a very different consideration. The possession which has the benefit of the protection of the law is, by the very supposition of tho case, a pos—ioo founded in wrong, and the practical effect of prohibiting any contract with relation to tho right which it withheld, is to render that right nugauxy and unavailing, unle— the party in whom it — vetted has in Ids own foods the meant of reeoit* ing to legal remedies lor its infraction. A for* ther effect is, that such right can onlypo— by operation of law and cannot be affectea by any testamentary or other disposition.—See some very judicious observations on the law of Champerty in Bentham’s Defence of Usury.

' ^TIERE in the Parliament holden at Westminster in the thirty-fast year of the reign of the noble King of famous memory Edward

* grievous fines and sums of money taken by the ministers of bishops and of other ordinaries of holy church for the probate of testaments

* and for the acquittances by the said ordinaries to be made concerning

the same, the said noble King in the same Parliament openly charged and commanded the Archbishop of Canterbury and the other bishops

for the time being that amendment thereof should be had; and if none . amendment were thereof had, it was by the authority of the same Par‘ liament accorded. That the King should thereof make inquiry by his

justices of such oppression and extortions; and that the same justices

* should hear and determine them as well at the suit of the King as of the party as of old time hath been used as by the same statute plainly appeared*. And where at the Parliament holden at Westminster in the

third year of the reign of King Henry the Fifth, it was recited, That the

* Commons of the realm had oftentimes complained them in divers Parliaments for that divers ordinaries do take for the probation of testaments and other things thereunto belonging sometime xl. s* sometime

* of King Edward the Third men were wont to pay for such causes but

* ii. s. vi. d. or v. s. at the most by which unlawful exactions the testa* ments of the testators might not be executed according to their last wills; it was then enacted lor the avoiding of such oppressions. That

no ordinary from thenceforth should take for the probation of any testament or inventory or for any other thing to the same belonging any

more than was accustomed and used in the time of the said noble King

Edward the Third, upon pain to yield to the party so grieved three rimes

* as much as the said ordinaries did so receive; which Act did endure

* but to the next Parliament following by reason that the ordinaries did

then promise to reform and amend the said oppressions and exactions;

and for that the said unlawful exactions of the said ordinaries and their 1 ministers be nothing reformed nor amended, but greatly augmented

* and increased against right and justice and to the great impoverishing

IV. Provided, That this Act or any thing herein contained shall not any Customs of

ways prejudice or hinder the customs observed within the city of London London and or within the province of York or other places having known and re- saved, ceived customs peculiar to them, but that the same customs may be Explained by observed as formerly; any thing herein contained to the contrary not- 1 6

to make distribution of the surplusage of the estate of any person How and to dying intestate shall distribute the whole surplusage of such estate whom the Sur-or estates in manner and form following: that is to say, one-third ptuaage is to be part of the said surplusage to the wife of the intestate, and all the redistributed, sidue by equal portions to and amongst the children of such persons dying 2 Mod. 20.101. intestate and such persons as legally represent such children in case 3 Mod. 58. any of the said children be then dead, (2.) other than such child or chU- 1 Venu dren (not being heir at law) who shall have any estate by the settlement Advancement of the intestate, or shall be advanced by the intestate in his life-time by by Portion.

(1.) The Bond n forfeited by not bringing in the account according to the condition, although there be no citation, but not for the non-payment of a debt of the intestate—Archbishop of Canterbury v. Wills. 1 Salk. 315. A judgment upon an administration bond obtained at the instance of a creditor to whom it was assigned, was decreed to stand as a security for what was due to the creditor so far as the assets would extend and costa—Greenside v. Benson, 3 Atk. 248. as corrected by Sanders, note, ibid, from the register’s book, that a creditor may sue on the bond in the name of the ordinary by his authority given, not personally but by the proper Court.—See Archbishop or Canterbury v. House, Cowp. 140.

The hood directed by the statute dots not extend to the case of an administrarioo during minority, but such bond may be good at common law — Folkes v. Dorminique, 2 Str. 1137. 80 in case of administration pendente file—Wallis v. Pipon, Ambl. 183.

(2.) If there be only living children and no issue of children deceased, all the children take equally, if there be no children living, all the issue of deceased children take equally in their own right, and per Capita—if there are children living, and the issue of children deceased, they take per Stirpei—the issue of the deceased children taking only their parents* shares.—An only child takes two-thuds against the wife.—Skinner 212.

portion or poitkms equal to the share which shall by such distribution be allotted to the other children to whom such distribution is to be made: And in case any child other than the heir at law who shall have any estate l»y settlement from the said intestate, or shall be advanced by the said intestate in his life-time by portion not equal to the share which will be due to the other children by such distribution as aforesaid; then so much of the surplusage of the estate of such intestate to be distributed to such child or children as shall have any land by settlement from the intestate, or were advanced in the life-time of the intestate, as shall make the estate of all the said children to be equal as near as can be estimated: but the heir at law notwithstanding any land that he shall have by descent or otherwise from the intestate is to"have an equal part in the distribution with the rest of the children without any consideration of the value of the land which he hath by descent or otherwise from the iiuestate.(3.)

VI. And in case there be no children nor any legal representatives of them, then one moiety of the said estate to be allotted to the wife of the intestate, the residue of the said estate to be distributed equally to every of the next of kindred (4.) of the intestate who are in equal degree and those who legally represent them. (5.)

(3.) Portions secured for children by settlement on the marriage of the parents are to be brought into hotchpot—Phiney v, Phiney, 2 Vera. 638.—Edwards v. Freeman, 2 P. Wins. 435. and this although the provision be contingent st the father's death—Edwards v. Freeman; but a provision by will of lands or personal estate in case of a partial intestacy shall not—Semble Edwards v. Freeman: so Twisden v. Twisden, 9 Vesey, 425.—The collation only takes place in case of actual intestacy and not where there is a complete will, and the executor is a trustee for the next of kin—Walton v. Walton, 14 Vesey, 324. —Land given toany child other than the heir, is an advancement by the express provision of the statute—VL Edwards t*. Freeman.—If, upon the marriage of a son, a settlement is made upon such son for his life and afterwards upon his wife and die issue of the marriage, the whole sum, and not merely the value of the interest, must be brought into hotchpot—Wayland v. Wayland,

2 Atk. 835.—" It has been determined that small inconsiderable sums occasionally given to a child cannot be deemed an advancement.—Thus maintenance money, or an allowance to a son st the university or in travelling, is not to be taken as any part of his advancement, this being only for his education.—So putting out a child apprentice is no advancement—Hender v. Rote at the Rolls, Trin. 1718.—But the father buying an office for the son, though but at will, or a commission in the army, are advancements—Norton v. Norton,

3 Peere Wms. 317, N." This was ruled as to the case of buying a commission—Lord Kirkud-bright v. Lady Kirkudbright, 8 Vesey, 51. An annuity or^other contingent interest is an advancement; let the contingencies be whit they may they do not prevent the value. An option was given to the son to account for the value of the annuity or the yearly payments under the peculiar circumstances, . C.—The nee of furniture for life, ruled an advancement—Fitagib. 285. —An advancement to the heir otherwise than land must be brought into hotchpot—Phiney v. Phiney

2 Vem. 838—Lord Kirkudbright xk Lady Kiiknd-bright, ub. tup.

In Pratt v. Pratt, 2 Str. 35. it was held that lands in Borough English descending upon a younger son must be brought into hotchpot, but the contrary was ruled by Lord Talbot, in Lor-wyche v. Lutwyche, and the judgment of Pratt v. Pratt, was afterwards reversed by him—Temp. Talbot, 276. Money expended in the repairs of houses which descended to the heir is no advancement, otherwise if the houses had been previously given to the heir—Smith v. Smith, 5 Ves. 721. The collation is wholly for the benefit of the children and not of the widow— Lord Kirkudbright v. Lady Kirkudbright.—The statute does not apply to advancements by a mother—Holt v. Frederick, 2 P. Wms. 358.

(4.) The cases of wife and children or representatives of children being provided for as above, the order of distribution is as follows:—1st. The Father.—2d. The mother, (see St. 1. % 2, post.) brothers and sisters, and children of deceased brothers and sisters taking by representation. (The children of deceased brothers and sisters take with the mother, although there be no brothers or sisters living, but the representation is not earned further bystat. 1 James II. any more 'than by 13 St 14 Charles IL—Stanley v. Stanley, 1 Atk. 455.)—3d. Grandfather and grandmother—(them are nearer in degree than the children of deceased brothers and sisters, taking in their awn right, there being no brother or sister living, and not by representation, and would therefore aeean entitled to take in exclusion of the nephews and nieces, although they would be themsehree excluded where foe nephews and nieces take with brothers and sisters by representation—but I do not find the case noticed, and there would be an apparent incongruity, in foe children of decerned children taking equally with the mother, as in Stanley A Stanley, end being excluded by a mom remote relation.—The case of there being both grandfather and grandmother in one line, and only one of those relatives in foe other, does not «pClass XIII.] Executor* and Administrators.

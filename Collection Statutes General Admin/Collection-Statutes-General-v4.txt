There are certain other writs which are to be determined by the assise, to wit, of n pond made, pulled down, or raised higher; of a fence raised or pulled down; of a hedge raised or pulled down i of a way obstructed or narrowed; of a water-course turned aside; and accord-iar to the diversity of the cases the original writ shall he changed: which writs are contained above with the writs of novel 4h$eirin% and the proceeding therein is after the same manner'as is above said in the writ of freehold, and of common of pasture.

There is another writ of assizes: when any one demandeth seisin of a tenement whereof his ancestor died seised: that is to say, the father, brother, uncle, and grandfather; for which case there is provided the writ of Mortdmmceeter, in the form contained in the aforesaid roll among the other writs. And it sometimes happeneth that seisin of an ancestor is demanded where the ancestor hath not died seised, but was seised on the day when he entered into religion, or began a pilgrimage in which journey be died, and then in place of the clause on the day wherooh be died, shall be-put “ on the day whereon be entered into “ reason or began bis pilgrimage, &c. in which pilgrimage, ftc. and

In this writ of mortdauncetter the proceeding 9hall be after this mbbpv i Vint pledges to prosecute being found, and the assize elected, tad view made by the jurors, the tenant shall be summoned by two good and lawful ^umrooners, that be be before the justice at a certain my; and the summons shall contain warning of fifteen days at the least; at which day if he come, the justice shall proceed in the execution df bis ofice. And if be come not at that day he shall be punished for his Mult according to the provision of the Welsh law, that is to my, by throe cows or the value thereof; and he shall be summoned again by two other suasmonars, by a summons containing the like warning of fifteen days as before is said; at which day whether he come or not the Justice shell proceed to do his ofice, unless he shall cause himself to be esaoigaed for being beyond sea, and then there shall be given him the spsce of forty days so that be have ebb and food: hut let him that shall so emoigu himself beware; for if being within the four seas, he falsely eMoign himself for being beyond sea, and he thereof convict by good proof or by good inquest, he shall he punished as for a default at the first by amerciament, according to what is contained in the Welsh law s aad also he shall be estopped trom saying any thing against the assize, tmless he can vouch to warranty. And be it known that neither in the writ of morUUnmeerter, nor in any writ of a plea of land, doth any eseign lie, ezeept only the essoign of being beyond sea, and this before fie tenant or deforciant appearetn in court; and the essoign ef being in the King’s service which lieth in every stage of the plea, when the King shall he pleased to^warrant the same; but let him Deware that he doth not falsely cause himself to he essoigned of the King’s service; for if he should fail of the King’s warranty he shall he punished for his default by amercement to he made to our Lord the King according to the Welsh law, aad by pay ing to the adverse party his expenses of that day, according to the justice’s discretion. In these writs of mortdaunceeler the proceeding shall he after this manner: First, the writ being read wherein is contained the claim of the demandant, the deforciant shall he asked if

No* II. be canaay ought wherefore the assize ought to tarry, which if he cannot,

HRdvardl Justice shall take the assize by the jurors, who may best know the troth according to the form of the writ. And if the assise pass for the’demandant, seisin shall be adjudged to the demandant with damages

taxed by the jurors, and the deforciant shall abide in the King's mercy. But the deforciant may allege many things against the assize; for he may vouch to warranty, and Iheo the arrival of the warrantor is to be waited for, whom the justice shall cause to come by one summons at the first, and if it be necessary by resummons as hath been said in the case of the principal deforciant; and he shall be punished for a default as is aforesaid: it after resummons he come not, nor shall essoign himself, the assize shall proceed against him by default And if the assize pass for the demandant seisin of the thing in question shall be adjudged to the demandant, and the deforciant shall have to the value of the land of the warrantor. But if the warrantor come and require to have that shewn him, whereby he ought to warrant, it behoveth the voucher to shew the deed that maketh mention of the warranty, or of a gift made by the warrantor or his ancestor whose-heir he is, wherein it is declared that he ought to hold of the feoffor and his heirs; or to shew that the warrantor was seised of his homage for the tenement demanded; which is to be enquired of if it should be denied by those before whom he shall say he did the homage together with other free and lawful men sworn; or that he holdeth that tenement in exchange for another tenement: if hereupon the deforciant can bring his warrantor to warrant, he shall abide in the King's mercy, because he hath denied the warranty; yet nevertheless it shall be considered that he may warrant and make answer to the assize if he choose.

The deforciant may allege many other things against die assize; to wit, that the ancestor, of whose death, &c. committed felony for Which he was hanged, outlawed, or as a public thief escaping, and not obedient to the law beheaded, or that he abjured Water upon confession of the felony before the coroner. The deforciant may also object bastardy to the demandant, and thereupon the bishop of the place snail be directed to make enquiry of the truth of the tact; and thereof to certify the Chief Justice of Water. And according to what the bishop shall have certified, they shall proceed to judgment without taking the assize. And if the bishop return that he is a bastard, he shall be estopped from making the demand; and if return that he is legitimate the justice shall cause the deforciant to come by summons, and if it be necessary by resummons, reserving to the King as hath been often said the amercement for default. After the resummons whether he corned not, the demandant shall recover his demand by the bishop's testimony, whose testimony shall not be gainsayed; and he shall remain in the King's mercy. Many other things he may allege which it is hard to enumerate, as that the ancestor on whose death the assize is arraigned was a villain, and held the land in villenage, or that he held it at will or foir term of life or years. In which cases the assize of mortdaimccrter lieth not, and the abovesaid assizes of novel duseinn and mortdauncertrr ought not to be taken but in their proper counties, lest the country should be overr charged with trouble and expense, but the assizes shall be taken by the justice twice, thrice, or four times in the year.

It hath been treated in part of writs and assizes, and of the proceed tog ' therein. It behoveth now to speak of pleas that are to be determined by inquests or by juries; whereof some are of things immoveable, as of tenements; or of moveables, as of debts and chattels; some of both kinds; some of trespasses. But, first, something is to be said of tenements and immoveable things, for which there is a writ provided, the term whereof is contained among the other writs of those parts: the proces upon that writ is such: First, there being found pledges to prosecute, the sheriff shall cause the tenant to be summoned by good suramoners, that he appear at a certain day, at which day if he come not he shall be summoned again for another day, and if he come not at the second day he shall be summoned to appear at a third day, at which day if he come not nor

Gia XV.3 Wale *, Couniie* Palatine, and Liberties. 11

ante himself to 1m estoigned, Nfein shell be awarded to the denMuuTanf No. II. by default, and the deforciant shall abide in the King’s mercy, reserving 12 Edward I nevertheless onto the King the amercement for every default as hath bees said before.

Now when the deforciant shall appear by reason that the plaintiff rs demand cannot be known from the words or the writ, for that the causes of suing are many and almost infinite, it is necessary that the demandant should count against the deforciant and express tt\p cause of his demand, and this by words that contain the truth without exception to words; not following that hard rule. He who fails m a syllable fails in the whole cause.

Of the causes of suit what they may be and ought to be it is fit that something should be briefly said. Oftentimes the demandant hath right by this that his ancestor held the land in demand* and was thereof seised as of right and fee j and then the demandant must count of the descent of kin descending to himself. It happeneth also that a man demiseth land for term of life or years, after which term the land ought to revert to himself or his heirs, or likewise that it ought to revert to him alter the death of a woman tenant in dower, or as an escheat after the death of his tenant being a bastard, because such an one cannot have other heir than one lawfully begotten of his own body; or after the death of his tenant who hath committed felony in any of the afore cases aforesaid, or where after the death of any one the land ought to remain unto another by the form of the gift in these cases, and the like, the demandant shall declare his demand according to his case, and in these cases and the like wherein the aforesaid writ is to be used, that and none other shall be used; and the demandant’s count being heard, the tenant shall have a view of the land if he require it, and a day shall be given within which the view shall be had, and at the day given after the viejr the deforciant shall make answer who may vottcn'to warranty by the aid of the court, as it hath been said in the writ of mortdaumcegter, and the iustice shall cause the warrantor to come as he caused the principal by one summons, and if it be necessary, by a second and a third, at which if he come not, he being punished upon every default as is aforesaid, seisin of the thing io question shall be awarded to the demandant for the default of the warrantor, and the deforciant shall have to the value of the land of the warrantor, and the warrantor shall be in mercy. If the warrantor come and freely warrant, he shall be received to answer and defend the plea without having a view of the land. But if he shall deny the warranty, the plea of the warranty dull be carried on between them after the manner above directed in the writ of morUdumcctter; but if the deforciant except against the demandant that his ancestor whose seisin be demandeth or any one in the descent were a bastard, so that nothing can descend from nim or through him, he shall be heard, or he may shew a deed of feoffment of his ancestor, or of quit claim of any one in the descent; and upon the affirmation of the one party and the denial of the other, the parties shall descend to the lawful inquest, and by theverdict of the inquest shall the plea be determined, because pleas of land in those parts are not to be determined by battle, nor by the grand assize. So if he should accept that the ancestor or any one in the descent committed felony whereby the action lieth not for him, in which case, if he to whom this is opposed denieth it, the matter ought rather to be determined by the record of' the justice, or of the inquest of the country of the hanging and beheading; and also by the record of the coroner of the outlawry and abjuration:io like manner on the demand of a tenement that ought to revert after a term past, or by the condition of the gift upon the affirmation of the one party and the denial of the other, they shall descend to the inquest of the country, and according to their verdict shall the judgment be.

Concerning the other article, to wit, of moveables, debts, and chattels, it remaineth to speak; for which there is provided the writ of debt in the form above written. In this writ, the proceeding shall be after this 7; First, there being found pledges to prosecute the debtor, and

19 Wak$> Ceuniies Palatine> and Liberties. [Part IV.

No. II. defendant shall be summoned to he before the justice at a certain day# 12 Edward L at which, if he come not, he shall be summoned again, and if at the second day he come not, nor essoign himself, the debt shall he adjudged to the plaintiff by default, together with damages at the discretion of the justice, or by the inquest of the country at the will of the justice and the debtor shall abide in the King's mercy, reserving always to the King the amercement for every default. But if the debtor appear, the plaintiff must then declare his demand, and the cause of his demand, that is to say, that he is indebted unto him in an hundred marks, which he lent him, the day of payment whereof is past* or for land, or an horse, or for other goods or chattels whatsoever sold to him* or for the arrears of a rent not growing out of tenements, or upon other contracts whereupon be .must produce nis suit, or shew the deed of obligation, or tally the demand, being heard and understood, and also the declaration of the plaintiff, the debtor shall answer thereto i and if he acknowledge the debt, judgment shall be given against him, and it shall be levied of his goods, and chattels, &c. if ne deny the debt, and his bond be brought form against him, the writing must be verified by the witnesses named in the bond, if they be living, together with the jury j and if there be no witnesses named, or if they should be dead, it shall be verified by the jury only, and according to their verdict shall judgment be awarded. But if the plaintiff have not a bond, but produce nis suit only, or a tally, the adverse parly may deny that he is indebted to him in any thing, and make his detbncp by wager of law, that is, by his own oath and eleven others swearing with him, or by the country at his election. H happeneth sometimes that the debtor confesseth that ne did once owe the debt, and allegeth payment thereof* in this case he must shew an acquittance of the payment, or else the plaintiff may deny by wager of law that he hath received ought, or likewise by the country, &c. This writ of debt shall not be granted for a less sum than forty shillings* for of a less debt the plea wall be in the county court either with writ or without,

Concerning the third article, in which there is provided the writ of covenant, whereby sometimes moveables are demanded, and sometimes immoveables by force of a covenant entered into between the parties which may differ from the law in the form described in the place before named. The proceeding upon this writ is thus: First, there Doing found pledges to prosecute, the defendant shall be summoned once, and if it be necessary & second time, and if he come not upon the second summons nor essoign himself, the demand and declaration of the plaintiff shall be heard, and the thing demanded shall be taken into the King’s hand if it he a tenement, and if it be a chattel, that or its value shall be taken into the King's hand, and another day shall be given him. And if within fifteen days he shall replevy 1he thing so taken into the King's hand, and appear at the day given him, he shall be received to answer and defend* out if not, the plaintiff's demand shall be awarded to him by default, together with damages taxed as is said before in the writ of debt. And he shall remain in the King's mercy; saving always to the King the amercement for the default as aforesaid. The plaintiff's complaint being heard, and the declaration of bis demand, the defendant shall make answer and upon the affirmation of the one party, and the denial of the other, they shall proceed to the inquest, and the business shall be determined by the inquest of the couetry. And- it is to be known that sometimes a freehold is demanded by the writ of covenant as where any man letteth lend to another to farm, rendering therefore a certain rent under a condition added thereto in the writing of covenant, that if he be not satisfied for the rent it shall be lawful for him to enter into the land that he hath demised, and to hold the same: if he to whom the land hath been demised do not pay the rent, and he who hath demised it hath' not the means of entering into the land demised according to the tenor of his writing -by reason of the power of his adversary, in this case he ought to recover the tenemeot by the writ of covenant, together with damages. Where sometimes a covenant is made

i puita, that the om Ail infeoff the ether of a certain tenement, and shaM deliver seisin unto him d« certain day » if afterwards he should transfer that tenement by feoffment to a third person, since he cannot annul that feofftnent by virtue of the first contract that was not carried into effect, h that case the injured party cannot have other redress by writ of covenant hut this only that he have a satisfaction m money for his damages; and thus in one case there tieth an action to demand a tenement by writ of covenant, and in another case mqitey or damages, or the tenement. And for that contracts m covenants are infinite, it would be difficult to make mention of each in particular: but, according to the nature of each covenant by the affirmation of the one party and the denial of the other, it will either come to be tried by inquest upon the fact, or it will come to an acknowledgment of the writings hr ought into judgment, and according to that acknowledgment Judgment will be awarded; or the writings will be denied, and then it will come to an inquiry into the making of the writings by the witnemes named in the writings if there be such, together with the jury:And if there should he 90 witnesses named, or they should be dead, then by the jury only.

Concerning the fourth article, to wit, personal trespasses; whereof it is provided, that all trespasses wherein the damages do not exceed forty shillings shall be pleaded before the sheriff in the county court without writ by gages and pledges i trespasses that exceed the sum of forty shillings shall be pleaded before die justice of Wales after this manner: The plaintiff, before he be heard by die justice, shall swear that his drmind exceedeth the sura of forty shillings, and this being dbne, and pledges to prosecute found, the justice shall command the sheriff or nairar of the place that he cause to come before him within a shortterm him of whom complaint is made; and the plaintiff's complaint being heard, fo defendant shall make his answer: And since in a plea of trespass Urn defendant can hardly do otherwise than make his defence by the country, the justice by consent of parties shall make inquiry of the truth by lawful inquest; and that inquiry made, if he find the defendant guilty, be shall punish him by imprisonment, or by ransom, or by amercement and payment of damages to the injured party according to the quality and quantity of the offence; so that this punishment be for example to others, and make them fear to offend: And whereas mention is made above of the consent of parties, it may happen that the defend-at will refuse the trial by the country; in which case if the plaintiff

to verify the trespass done nnto him by the country, and the defendant refuse the same, he shall be taken for convict, and shall be punished as though he were convict by the country.

And whereas heretofore women have not been endowed in Wales, the King granteth that they shall be endowed. The dower of a woman is two-fold s one is an assignment of the third part of the whole land that betoBgeth to her husband which were his during coverture, whereof there Tieth the writ of reasonable dower elsewhere described in its place, with the other writ for Wales. The proceeding in this writ is thus: There being found pledges to prosecute, the deforciant shall be summoned to appear at a certain day, at which, if he home not, he shall be summoned*again; at which day, if he come not, the woman shall have her dower awarded unto her; that is to say, the third part, Ac.c., together with damages, Ac.c.; but if the defendant appear, he shall be received to answer without having a view of the land, and the woman's demand* being made, the tenant shall he directed to answer if he can allege any thing wherefore she ought not to have her dower; and if he can allege nothing the woman shall recover as above. If he should object that she ought not to have her dower because she was never espoused in lawful matrimony to him whom she calleth her husband, then the bishop shall be charged to make inquiry of the truth thereof; and that inquiry made, be mall certify it to the justice of Walct, And according to the bishop's certificate shall the proceeding to judgment be after this manner: If the bishop certify that we was not the lamul wife, she shall be foreclosed of

14 JFifat, Gomtm Pukdiae, mid Liberties. [Fart IV.

No. IL Mtio11 of Slower 9 if he certify that she was the lawful wife, the 12 Edward I 'teDUt AiH be summoned to appear at a certain day to hear his judg-J meat, at which day if be come not be shall he summoned unto another

day; at which day whether become or not there being no essoign allowed the woman shall recover her dower and damages, and the tenant in mercy. Saving always to the King the amercement for default. But if he object that me ought not to have her dower because her husband did not hold the tenement whereof she demandeth dower, either on the day when he married her or at any Jime after in fee, so Unit he could thereof have endowed her; the truth of this fact is to be inquired of by the country only, and according to their verdict shall the judgment be awarded. If it be objected unto her that she ought not to have her dower because her husband committed felony, then, if the felony be proved, she shall not recover dower. So if it be objected unto her that her husband lost the land whereof she demandeth dower by judgment as . that whereunto he had not right, if this be denied and be proved by the record of the justices before whom that land was lost, or by the country, if it were lost in the country or inferior court, she shall be precluded from having her action of dower. The other dower is when a son en-doweth his wife by the assent of his father, the form of the writ whereof is to be found among the rest, wherein the proceeding is after this manner :—The deforciant shall be summoned as in the other writ of dower, and in like manner his contumacy shall be punished as in the other writ of dower: but if he come at the day given him, then the woman’s demand being made, he shall answer thereto; and if the endowment made in the said form and the consent to the dower be denied, and it be established by the country that the husband did endow her at the chorcji door of his father’s tenement; and that the hither, in his own person or by a special messenger therefore sent, did consent to that dower, the woman shall recover her dower and damages. It is also to be known that in either writ the tenant may vouch to warranty with the aid of the court, and the proceeding in the plea of warranty shall be as is before directed:but there is a difference between this case of dower and that above by precipe, where the mode of proceeding endtth in the warranty, because there the demandant in that case always recover-eth the thing demanded, and the tenant out of the land of the warrantor to the value. In the case of dower it is otherwise, because the tenant « will keep his laqd in peace, and the woman will have to the value of her dower demanded out of the laud of the warrantor, provided that the tenant hath of the land of her husband to the value whereby this may be done $ but if otherwise not. Concerning other assignment of dower there is nothing said for the present

Whereas the custom is otherwise in Walet than in England concerning succession to an inheritance, inasmuch as the inheritance is partible among the beirs male, and from time whereof the memory of man is not to the contrary, hath been partible; our Lord the King will not have that custom abrogated; but willeth that inheritances shall remain partible among like heirs as it was wont to he, and partition of the ^arae inheritance shall be made as it was wont to be made; with this exception, that bastards from henceforth shall not inherit, and also shall not have portions with the lawful heirs, nor without the lawful* heirs. And if it happen that any inheritance should hereafter upon the failure of heir male descend unto females, the lawful heirs of their ancestor last seised thereof, we will of our special grace that the same women shall have their portions thereof to he assigned them in our court, although this he contrary to the custom of Wale* before used.

And whereas the people of fFalct liave besought us that we would 'grant unto them, that concerning their possessions immoveable, as landh and tenements, the truth may he tried by good and lawful men of the neighbourhood, chosen by consent of parties; and concerning.things moveable as of contract ^, debts, sureties, covenants, trespasses, chattels, and all other moveables of the same sort, they may use the Welsh law whereto they have been accustomed; which was this, that if a man

complain of another upon contracts or things done in such a place that the plaintiff's case may be proved by thofte who saw and heard it, when the plaintiff shall establish his case by those witnesses whose testimony cannot be disproved, then he ought to recover the thing in demand, and the advene party be condemned; and that in other cases which cannot be proved by persons who saw and heard, the defendant should be put to his purgation, sometimes with a greater number, sometimes wiui less, according to the quality and quantity of the matter or deed. And that in theft if one be taken with the mainour he shall not be admitted to purgation, but he holden for convict. We, for the common peace and quiet of our aforesaid people of our land of /Foist, do grant the premises unto them:yet 90 that thej hold not place in thefts, larcenies, burnings, murders, manslaughters, and manifest and notorious robberies, nor do by any means extend unto these $ wherein we will that they shall use the laws of England as is before declared.

' ^TO’HERE in the High Court of Parliament holden at Westminster 1 VI.

in the seven and twentieth year of the most prosperous reign of c*l0 *

the late famous King Henry the Eighth, by the assent of the Lords 27 H. 8. c.26.

Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, assembled in the said

High Court of Parliament, it was enacted and established by authority ft of the same Parliament, That his Highness dominion and principality

of Woles, and all manors, lands, tenements, and other dominions

within the said dominion and principality of Wales, should be divided into twelve shires or counties, that is to say, the shires or counties of Glamergan, Radnor, Brecknock, Caermarthen, Pembroke, Cardigan,

4 Merioneth, Montgomery, Flint, Caernarvon, Anglesey and Denbigh 1

In every of which said counties and shires, amongst the officers yearly

appointed, it was then ordained, that there should be distiuct and sevend sheriffs yearly And also where the counties palatine of Chester,

4 and <of the city of Chester, be ancient and several counties palatine of themselves, in all wfiich said counties the King’s writ hath not not yet

doth run 1 so thetlhe proclamation awarded upon any exigent against

any person or persohscm any action wherein process of outlawry doth

lie, according to the statute made in the sixth year of the reign of the

said late King, cannot*be directed unto the sheriff or sheriffs of any of

the mid shires or counties, but unto the sheriff of the county next ad- joining: So that the party dwelling in any of the said shires or counties against whom any such exigent and proclamation shall be so awarded, shall not, nor can have any knowledge of the same suit or process, by reason whereof many or the persons inhabiting in the mid shires or counties, without knowledge or cause of suit, have been wrongfully and unjustly outlawed to their utter undoing.

IL Be it therefore, and for divers other good considerations, by the Exigents and King our Sovereign Lord, with the assent of the Lords Spiritual and proclsmstion Temporal, and the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and 8““1 be *rd(1) Mr - Barrington observes, that the justices of the Grent Sessions have so long exercised the power of deciding causes in a court of equity, that if cannot now be disputed: but that how they originally obtained this juris-ffietion is rather dark, as in the present statute, which most particularly enumerates every officer in the courts of law, there is no mention made of any officer for the courts of equity. He also takes notice, that by a manuscript of all the King’s officers in the first of Queen Mary,

it appears that Roger Vaughan was Chancellor of Brecknock, but Walter Devereux, Viscount Hereford, was at that time justice; Sir John Salisbury was likewise then Chancellor of North Wales, and William Cook, justice: so that the offices In that reign were considered as distinct. -—It is to be remarked, that in stat 27 Hen.

In case plaintiff shall recover damages to amount of 10/1; defendant shall be intitled to judgment and remedy thereon, &c.

(1) The origin of the courts of Westminster miming jurisdiction over causes in Wales, and greeting the trial in an adjoining English county, does not distinctly appear; I think the truth most probably is, that it was founded in mere usurpation, and, like many other usurpations of jurisdiction, supported by fictions; but the practice has actually existed for a great length of time, and is in many respects very

The right of issuing a latitat into Wales has been the subject of considerable controversy. In Lempley v. Thomas, 1 Wils. 193, the question wan raised by demurrer, and was argued three times: during the progress of the arguments the court seemed sufficiently disposed to adhere to the jurisdiction, but finally derided against it, without saying more than these words u Bret domini regis de latitat non event 6i Waltiam” In Mr. Hargreave’s Law TYscts, p. 377, there is a very learned and elaborate argument, occasioned by the discussion of this case, and apparently written before the decision of it, in opposition to the jurisdiction. In Lloyd v, Jones, Doug. 213, u. upon a subsequent discussion of the question, Yates J. intimated a derided opinion in favour of the jurisdiction of the court: but the case stood over to be argued again; when the defendant declining (in all due courtesy) a further argument, judgment was given for the plaintiff.

And in Penny r. Jones, Doug. 213, application bring made for a rule to shew cause why an exoneretur should not be entered on the bail-piece, the defendant having been arrested ia Wisles, the court refused the rule, saying, that the proper way, if the court had not jurisdiction, was to plead in abatement; and Boiler said, that since the case in Wilson the contrary doctrine had been held in several cases, particularly In the case already mentioned, where Yates J. had considered the case very ftdty, and delivered a solemn argument upon it Hie reporter observes, that the present Act seems very clearly to recognise the jurisdiction, which is certainly the case, however disputable in point of argument, independently of such recognition, the question might have been. In Ambrose v. Rees, 11 East, 370, the court refused to set aside a trial at Monmouth, on a venue in South Wales, for irregularity; assigning as a reason, that the defendant did not object at the time; but in Goodright ex. dem. Richards r. Williams, 2 M. A. . 270, the court arrested the judgment, after a trial in Salop, upon a venne in Cardiganshire, upon the ground that the practice had always been to consider Herefordshire ss the npxt adjoining county to South Wales, and Salop to North Wales. This decision has always appeared to me to stand on very unsatisfactory grounds, in treating that which had been a mere course and habit of practice, as a rule of law; a thing which the courts themselves have in some instances strongly objected to The venue Is also directed into the particular county upon a suggestion of its being the adjoining county as a matter of fact; and it is perfectly anomalous to treat the same subject as one which is to be stated upon suggestion as matter of fact, and also as one which is to be judicially recognised as matter of law. The fact of its being general to try issues in South Wales in the county of Hereford may be sufficiently accounted for from that being, in feet, the nearest county to a great part of South Wales, ss Salop is confessedly the nearest county, into which the King’s writ runs, to the greater part of North Warns: but, at any rate, a deviation from an established course of practice would, in such case, have been more regularly corrected by an application to a judge, than by treating it as an error upon the record.

4 *EX UMBLY shew unto our Sovereign Lord the King, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in Parliament assembled,

4 That whereas it is declared and enacted by a statute made in the time

of the reign of King Edward the First, commonly called statutum de tallagio non concedendo, That no tallage or aid shall be laid or levied by the King or his heirs in this realm, without the good will and assent of

the archbishops, bishops, earls, barons, knights, burgesses, and other the

freemen of the commonalty of this realm; and by authority of Parliament holden in the five and twentieth year of the reign of King Edward the Third, it is declared and enacted, That from henceforth no person should be compelled to make any loans to the King against his will,

because such loans were against reason and the franchise of the land:

and by other laws of this realm it is provided, That none should be charged by any charge or imposition called a benevolence, nor by such

like charge: By which the statutes before mentioned, and other the good

laws and statutes of this realm, your subjects have inherited this tree *

dom, That they should not be compelled to contribute to any tax, tallage, 4 aid, or other like charge, not set by common consent in Parliament.

follows4 No man shall be condemned at

the King’s suit, either before the King in his Beach, where the pleas are coram rege9 4 (and 6o qre the words ncc super cum ibimus,

to be understood) nor before any other commissioner or judge whatever (and so are the words nec super cum mittemus% to be understood.*)—Note to Ruffheads Edition of the Statutes.

means whereof your people have been in divers places assembled, and required to lend certain.sums of money unto your Majesty, and many ' of them, upon their refusal so to do, nave had an oath administered unto them not warrantable by the law or statutes of this realm, and have been constrained to become bound to make appearance and give

attendance before your privy council and in other places, and others of them have been therefore imprisoned, confined, and sundry other wavs molested and disquieted; and divers other charges have been laid and levied upon your people in several counties by lord lieutenants, 4 deputy lieutenants, commissioners for musters, justices of peace and otiers, by command or direction from your Majesty, or your privy council, against the laws and free customs of the realm.

III. And where also by the statute called The Great Charter of the Liberties of England” it is declared and enacted. That no freeman may betaken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his freehold or liberties, 4 or his free customs, or be outlawed or exiled, or in any manner destroyed, but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.

IV. And in the eight and twentieth year of the reign of Xing Edward the Third, it was declared and enacted by authority of Parliament, 4 That no man, of what estate or condition that he be, should be put out of his land or tenements, nor taken, nor imprisoned, nor uis- herited, nor put to death, without being brought to answer by due process of law:

V. Nevertheless against the tenor of the said statutes, and other the good laws and statutes of your realm to that end provided, divers of your subjects have of late been imprisoned without any cause shewed and when for their deliverance they were brought before your justices by vour Majesty’s writs of habca* eorput, there to undergo and receive as the court should order, and their keepers commanded to certify the causes of their detainer, uo cause was certified, but that they were detained by your Majesty's special command, signified by the Lords of your privy council, and yet were returned back to several prisons, without being charged with any thing to which they might make answer according to the law.

VI. And whereas of late great companies of soldiers and mariners have been dispersed into divers counties of the realm, and the inhabitants against their wills have been compelled to receive them into their

houses, and there to suffer them to sojourn, against the laws and customs of this realm, and to the great grievance and vexation of the

people:

VII. And whereas also by authority of Parliament, m the five and twentieth year of the reign of King Edward the Third, it is declared and enacted. That no man should be forejudged of life or limb against

the form of the Great Charter and the law of the land; and by the said

Great Charter and other the laws and statutes of this your realm, no man ought to be adjudged to death but by the laws established in this your realm, either by the customs of the same realm, or by Acts of Parliament: And whereas no offender of what kind soever is exempted from the proceedings to be used, and punishments to be inflicted by the laws and statutes of this your realm: Nevertheless of late time divers commissions under your Majesty’s great seal have issued forth, by which certain persons have been assigned and appointed commissioners, with power and authority to proceed within the land, according to the justice of martial law, against such soldiers or mariners, 4 or other dissolute persons joining with them, as should commit any murther, robbery, felony, mirtiuy or other outrage or misdemeanor whatsoever, and ny such summary course and order as is agreeable to martial law, and as is used in armies io time of war, to proceed to the trial and condemnation of such offenders, and them to cause to be executed and put to death according to the law martial.

[No. IV.] SI Charles II. c. 2.—-An Act for the better securing the liberty of the subject, and for prevention of imprisonment beyond the seas. (1)

1TOrHSRBAS great delays have been used by sheriffs, gaolers, and « ▼ v other officers, to whose custody any of the King's subjects have

been committed for criminal or supposed criminal matters* in making

returns of writs of hefteet eirpsi to them directed* by standing out an alias and ptmries habeas cirjwi, and sometimes more* and by other shifts to avoid their yielding obedience to such writs* contrary to their

duty and the known laws of the land, whereby many of the King’s 4 subjects have been, and hereafter may be long aeftained in prison* in

(1) Of the passing of this important Act Bishop Burnet relates the following extraordi-anecdote; Vol. I. p. 485 It was car-by an odd artifice in the House of LordB. Lord Grey and Lord Norris were named to be the tellers. Lord Norris being a man subject to the vapours was not at all tunes attentive to what be was doing; so a very fat lord coming In, Lord Grey counted him for ten, as a jest at first; but seeing Lord Norris had not observed it, he went on with this mis-reckoning of ten: so it was reported to the house, and declared that they who were for the bill were the majority; though, indeed, it went on the other aide: and by this means the bill passed.” Whatever doubt may be entertained of the troth of this anecdote, it may at least be taken for granted that such a story could not have become current unless there nad been. In fact, a strong opposition to the measure. For the reasons of pairing the Act* see 3 Bla. Com. 136.

Hie Act has been at various times suspended, with respect to the power of imprisonment of the crown, upon occasions of public alarm; such suspensions usually being for a very short period. The general title given to such temporary acts has been, 44 An Act to empower nis Majesty to secure and detain such persons as his Mqeitjr shall suspect are conspiring against bis person and governments* The following are Acts of this description: 1 W. d M. s. 1.

ch. 7* 19; 7 & 8 W. III. c. 11; 6 Anna* c. 15; 7 Anne, c. 9; 1 Geo. I. ch. 8* 30; 17 Geo. 1L c. 6; 19 Geo. IL c. 1; 34 Geo. IIL c. 54; which was followed by subsequent Acts during the then existing war. See the discussion on the writ of habeas carpus by Lord Chief Justice Wilmot, in his Reports* p. 77; some parts of which have been superseded by the enactments in the following number.

The recent alteration of the law* although necessary to give effect to the spirit and principles of the former enactment* did not pass without considerable opposition; but the arguments against it seemed principally to consist In the usual topic of the dangers of innovation. The opposition was* In a previous session* attended with success; and the final adoption of the measure may seem as a lesson to those* whose attention is directed to beneficial alterations of the law* not to be discouraged by a temporary failure.

The liberty of the subject would be materially promoted by giving the judges a discretionary power to discharge from illegal commitments* by rule of court or order, without the necessity of the actual appearance of the party, which, in most cases, has no other effect than a great accumulation of expense* and the necessity of which often occasions a mutual failure of justice; as any person who has been in the habit of perusing the calendars of courts of quarter sessions will be easily convinced.

* N case when a man doth lose by default the land which was the 4 X right of his wife, it was very hard that the wife, after the death of her husband, had none other recovery but by a writ of right; ’1 wherefore our Lord the King hath ordained. That a woman, after the death of her husband, shall recover by a writ of enti*y (whereto she could not disagree during his life) which shall be pleaded in form underwritten. If the tenant do except against the demand of the wife, that lie entered by judgment, and it be found that bis entry was by default, whereto the tenant of necessity roust make answer, if it be demanded of him, then he shall be compelled to make further answer, and to shew his right according to the form of the writ that he purchased before against the husband and the wife. And if he can verify that he hath right in the land demanded, the woman shall gain nothing by her writ; which thing if he cannot shew, the woman shall recover the land in demand; this being observed, that if the husband absent himself, and will not defend his wife’s right, or against his wife’s consent will render the land, if the wife do come before j udgment, ready to answer the demandant, and to defend her right, the wife shall be admitted. Likewise if tenant in dower, tenant by the law of the land, or otherwise for term of life, or by gift, where the reversion is reversed, do make default, or will give up; the heirs, and they unto whom the reversion belongethp shall be admitted to their answer if

And if it be alleged against her, that her husband lost the land, whereof the dower is demanded by judgment, whereby she ought not to have dower, and then it be inquired by what judgment, and it be found that it was by default, where- unto the tenant must answer; then it behoveth the tenant to answer further, and to shew that he had right, and hath in the foresaid land,

the tenant shall go nuit, and the wife shall recover nothing of her dower; which thing if he cannot shew, the wife shall recover her dower.

(1) This statute evidently extends only to rents reserved upon lease or contract. The statute 4 George II. c. 28. s. 5, which gives a power to distrain for rents sod entry, rents of* assise and chief rents, also contains a power of sale. The Irish statute 25 Geo. II. c. 13, gives a power of sale in case of distress for rent services, fee farm rents, or rent charges. This is not provided for by any English statute, except so far as the term chief rents in Geo. II. may be supposed to include rents services and fee farm rents.

And it is hereby further enacted and declared by the authority aforesaid, That all distresses hereby empowered to be made as aforesaid, shall be liable to such sales, and in suen manner, and the monies arising by such sales to be distributed in like mauner, as by an Act made in the second year of the reign of their late Majesties King fVUtiam and Queen Mary, intituled, “ An Act for enabling the Sale or Goods distrained for Rent, in case the Rent be not paid iu reasonable Time, *' is in that behalf directed and appointed.

In an action for double value, and also for use and occupation, the defendant paid the single rent into Court upon the latter count, and the plaintiff by taking It out was held not to wave his right under the former, so as to be subject to nonsuit thereon, but that the case ought to have gone to the jury; Ryal e. Rich, 10 E. 48. The action for double value may he brought after a* judgment in ejectment, for the holding over down to the time of recovering the possession; Soulsby v. Nevin, 9 E. 310.

variations, from the Irish Statute 11 Anne, c.2. sec. 1. See 1 Gabbctt, 468.

(4) In Doe v. Lewis, 1 Burr. 614, the lessor haring recovered in a former ejectment under this Act, the lessee, after a lapse of several years, brought a second ejectment on the title of his lease; and the proceedings in the first ejectment being in all other respects confessedly regular, he insisted that he was Intitled to recover, because no affidavit was produced which had been made in conformity to the Act: and the Court held that It was not incumbent on the landlord to prove the regularity of all the circumstances upon which his judgment and execution ware founded; but that the judgment must be taken to have been a right, regular and good one, as nothing appeared to the contrary.

(5) Where the rent became due on the 25th of March, the demise waa laid on the 2d of May, it appeared that there was no sufficient distress on tome day in May (tha particular day being left uncertain) and the declaration served on the 6th of June, no evidence being given by the defendant to repel the inference of there being ao sufficient distress, byahewing

III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in case the said lessee or lessees, his, her, or their assignee or assignees, or other person or persons claiming any right, title or interest, in law or equity, of, in, or to the said lease, shall, within the time aforesaid, file one or more bill or bills, for relief in any court of equity, such person or persons shall not have or continue any injunction, against the proceedings at law on such ejectment, unless he, she, or they do or shall, within forty days next after a full and perfect answer shall be filed by the lessor or lessors of the plaintiff in such ejectment, bring into court.

a sufficient distress up to the day of the demise, or on the 6th of June (supposing that to be necessary) the case of the plaintiff, as to there being no sufficient distress, was held to be sufficiently proved to bring the case within the Act; Doe v. Smelt, 15 E. 286.

(1) An ejectment can only be maintained under the statute in case there is no distress, or at common law in case a demand is made on the day, with all requisite formalities; Doe d. Forster v. Wandlass, 7 T. R. 117. It is not necessary to make any demand in order to entitle a plaintiff to recover in a case brought in other respects within the Act, although the proviso for re-entry be expressed to be in esse of the rent being in arrear (being lawfully demanded); Doe d. Scholfield v. Alexander, 2 M. and . 525. When, by the terms of the lease, there is a proviso for re-entry in case of nonpayment, although not lawfully demanded, an ejectment maybe maintained without reference to the statute, the demand being dispensed with by riie express terms of the lease; and by Lord Mansfield—“The Act of Geo. 11. is very perplexed:but the meaning certainly only is, that

where there is no stipulation in the lease for entry without demand, you may notwithstanding enter without demand, provided six months' rent is in arrear, and there is not a sufficient distress; otherwise, in such cases you must make a demandGoodright d. Hare v. Cater, Doug. 478. It is always desirable that the proviso should be for re-entry, although the rent be not demanded, and that no mention should be made of there being no sufficient distress; and this would be no essential prejudice to the lessee, as in case there is a sufficient distress, it could be disposed of to the most advantage under his own directions, and there can be no doubt that he would be relieved from the forfeiture, if not at lawy at least in equity, by payment according to the terms of the Act. In Doe d. West r. Davis, 7 E. 363, it seems to be held, that the wont of sufficient distress was not requisite in order to bring a case within the statute. But the report is in this respect not very clear; and the supposed doctrine seems contrary both to the case of Doe v. Wandlass, and to the express language of the Act.

proved sufficient to obtain the good ends and purposes designed thereby,

• but rather the fraudulent practices of tenants, and the mischief in• tended by the said Acts to be prevented, have of late years increased, to the great loss and damage or their lessors or landlordsFor remedy whereof, may it please your most excellent Majesty, that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the twenty-fourth day of June, in the year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight, in case any tenant or tenants, lessee or lessees, for life or lives, term of years, at will, sufferance, or otherwise, of any messuages, lands, tenements, or hereditaments, upon the demise or holding whereof any rent is or shall be reserved, due, or made payable, shall fraudulently or clandestinely convey away, or carry on or from such premises, bis, (l) her, or their goods or chattels, to prevent the landlord or lessor, landlords or lessors, from distraining the same for arrears of rent so reserved, due, or made payable; (2) it shall Sad may be lawful to and for every landlord or lessor, landlords or lessors, within that part of Great Britain called England, dominion of fValet, or the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, or any person or persons by him, her, or them, for that purpose lawfully empowered, within the spac.e of thirty days next ensuing such conveying away or carrying off such goods or chattels as aforesaid, to take ana seize such goods and chattels, wherever the same shall be found, as a distress for the said arrears of rent; and the same to sell, or otherwise dispose of, in such manner as if the said goods and chattels had actually been distrained by such lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, in and upon such premises, for such arrears of rent $ any law, custom, or usage to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

Landlords may distrain and sell goods fraudulently carried off the premises within thirty days, unless sold to any person not privy to the fraud.

(1) The stat. 11 Geo. II. c. 19., empowering landlords to follow goods fraudulently and clandestinely carried .off the premises within thirty days, applies to the goods of the tenant only, and not to those of a stranger: wherefore, a plea justifying the following goods off the premises, and distraining them for rent

arrear, must shew that they were the tenant's goods; Thornton v. Adams, 5 M. & . 38.

(2) In order to justify the landlord distrain^ ing under this Act, the removal must have taken place after the rent became due, and must have been secret, and not open and in the face of day; Watson v. Mann, 3 Esp. Rep. 19.

III. And to deter tenants from such fraudulent conveying away their goods and chattels, and others from wilfully aiding or assisting therein, or concealing the same; Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twenty-fourth day of June, if any such tenant or lessee shall fraudulently remove and convey away his or her goods or chattels as aforesaid, or if any person or persons shall wilfully and knowingly aid or assist any such tenant or lessee in such fraudulent conveying away or carrying off of any part of his or her goods or chattels, or (I) in concealing the same $ all and every person and persons so offending, shall forfeit and pay to the landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, from whose estate such goods and chattels were fraudulently carried off as aforesaid, double the value of the goods(2) by him, her, or them respectively carried off or concealed as aforesaid to be recovered by action of debt in any of his Majesty's courts of record at Westminster, or in the courts of session in the counties palatine of Chester, Lancaster, or Durham respectively, or in the courts of grand sessions in Water* wherein no essoin, protection, or wager of law shall be allowed, nor more than one imparlance.

IV. Provided always, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That where the goods and chattels so fraudulently carried off or concealed shall not exceed the value of fifty pounds, it shall and may be lawful for the landlord or landlords from whose estate such goods or chattels were removed, his, her, or their bailiff, servant, or agent, in his, her, or their behalf, to exhibit a complaint in writing (3) against such offender or offenders, before two or more justices of the peace of the same county, riding, or division of such county, residing near the place whence such goods and chattels were removed, or (4) near the place where the same were found, not being interested in the lands or tenements whence such goods were removed; who may summon the parties concerned, examine the fact, and all proper witnesses, upon oath, or if any such witness be one of the people called Quakers, upon affirmation required by law \ and in a summary way determine, whether such person or persons be guilty of the offence, with which he or they are charged; and to enquire in like manner of the value of the goods and chattels by him, her, or them respectively so fraudulently carried off or concealed as aforesaid; and, upon rail proof of the offence, by order (5) under their hands and seals, the said justices of peace may and shall adjudge the offender or offenders to pay double the value of the said goods and chattels to such landlord or landlords, his, her, or their bailiff, servant, or agent, at such time as the said justices shall appoint: And in case the offender or offenders, having notice of such order, shall refuse or neglect so to do, may and shall, by warrant under their hands and seals, levy the same by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of the offender or offenders: and for want of such distress, may commit the offender or offenders to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour without hail or mainprize

(1) In Rex v. Middlehurst, 1 Bor. 399, an order of justices, founded upon the next section, for assisting in fraudulently removing or concealing, was held good.

(2) In an action founded upon this provision, a variance in stating the amount of the rent in arrear is not material $ Gwinet v, Phi-Ups, 3T.R.643.

(5) In Rex v. Bissex, Burn, tit. Distress, it was ruled that a proceeding under this Act is an order, and not a conviction; and that therefore it was not necessary to set ont the evidence; and several particular objections to the form of the order, in respect of the particulars necessary to be stated, were overruled. Upon the same distinction between an order and a conviction, it was ruled in the case of Rex v. Middleton, mentioned in the note to the last section, that the offence might be set out disjunctively; but in Rex v. Morgan, Caldec. 156, the proceeding seems to be treated as a conviction.

VII. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That where any goods or chattels fraudulently or clandestinely conveyed or carried away by any tenant or tenants, lessee or lessees, bis, her, or their servant or servants, agent or agents, or other person or persons aiding or aaaiating therein, shall be pat, placed, or kept in any house, barn, stable, out-house, yard, dose or place locked up, fastened, or otherwise scoured, so as to prevent such goods or chattels from being taken and seined as a distress for arrears of rent i it shall and may be lawful for the landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, bis, her, or their steward, bailiff, receiver or other person or persons empowered to take and seize, as n distress for rent, such goods and chattels f first calling to his, her, or their assistance, the constable, headborough, boisholaer, or other peace officer of the hundred, borough, parish, district or place, where the same shall be suspected to be concealed, who are hereby required to mid and assist therein i and in case of a dwelling-house, oath being also first made before some justice of the peace of a reasonable ground to suspect that such goods or chattels are therein) in the day-time, to break open and enter into such house, barn, stable, out-house, yard, dote and place, and to take and seize such goods and chattels for the said arrears of rent, as he, she, or they might have done by virtue of this or any former Act, if such goods and chattels had been put in any open field or place.

4 X. And whereas great difficulties and inconveniences frequently arise to landlords and lessors and other persons' taking distresses for rent, in removing the goods and chattels or stock distrained off the premisses, in cases where by law they may not be impounded and secured thereupon; and also to the tenants themselves many times, by the damage unavoidably done to such goods and chattels, or stock, in the removal thereofBe it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twenty-fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight, it shall and may be lawful to and for any person or persons lawfully taking any distress for any kind of rent, to impound, or otherwise secure the distress so made, of what nature or kind soever it may be, in such place, or on such part(l) of the premisses chargeable with the rent, as shall be most fit and convenient for the impounding and securing such distress: and to appraise, sell and dispose of the same upon the premisses, in like manner, and under the like directions and restraints to all intents and purposes, as any person taking a distress for rent may now do off the premisses, by virtue of an 2W.&M. c. 5.

4 XII. And whereas great inconveniences have frequently happened to landlords by their tenants secreting declarations in ejectment, which have been delivered to them, or by refusing to appear to such eiect- ments, or to suffer their landlords to take upon them the defence thereof, ’ Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from Against tenants and after the said twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand seven hun- secreting eject-dred and thirty-eight, every tenant, to whom any declaration in eject- ments. ment shall be delivered for any lands, tenements or hereditaments, in that part of Great Britain called England, dominion of /Fairs, or town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, shall forthwith give notice thereof to his or her landlord or landlords, or his, her or their bailiff or receiver, under penalty of forfeiting the value of three vears(l) improved or rack rent (2) of the premisses so demised or holden in the possession of such tenant, to the person of whom he or she holds: to be recovered by action of debt to be brought in any of his Majesty’s Courts of Record at Westminster, or in the counties palatine of Chewier, Lancaster, and Durham respectively, or in the courts of Grand Sessions in Waits* wherein no essoin, protection or wager of law shall be allowed, nor any more than one imparlance.

estopped himself from taking that objection, and that in an action for the value of three years' improved rent, under the Statute of 11 Geo.

II. c. 19, s. 12, is not the rent reserved, but such a rent as the landlord and tenant might fairly agree on at the time of delivering the declaration in ejectment, in case the premises were then to be let; Croker v. Fothergill, 2 B. A A. 652.

The Court said that the statute only extended to cases where ejectments were brought, which were inconsistent with the landlord’s title. They observed likewise that the ejectment was brought for the purpose of compelling the tenant to attorn to the mort174

gagee, which the Act expressly permitted him to do. The notion of ejectments for the purpose of compelling tenants to attorn is materially altered since this decision.

(1; It appears by the case of Fairclaim ex dem. Fowler o. Shamtitle, 3 Burr. 1290, that a practice had prevailed of admitting landlords to defend previous to this statute, and several cases of the kind are referred to in Adams's Treatise on Ejectments, Chap. 8, the questions la which related to the particular character of the parties applying to be admitted. In the first ease on the subject, Roe d. Lock r. Doe, Barnes 193, the question was between different devisees claiming under conflicting wills of the lessor, and it was held that the Court had no jurisdiction to admit any person to defend an ejectment instead of the defendant, except the landlord only; and who, it is said, is a landlord within the Act; not every person claiming title, but one who is in some degree of possession, one receiving rent, &c.: the clause of forfeiture by a tenant, if he does not give notice of declaration to his landlord, proves this.

In Adams on Ejectment this doctrine is said to have been reprobated by Lord Mansfield, in the case of Fairclaim and Shamtitle above alluded to; but I do not see that there any such disapprobation is particularly expressed; and I apprehend that the principle of the decision in Koe v. Doe is that which now prevails in practice, although some of the expressions are not literally correct; and that where there is a valid and undisputed demise, the question as to which of two adverse claimants as entitled to stand in the character of landlord, and to receive the rents, cannot in any case he tried in ejectment. In Fairclaim v. Shamtitle, the ejectment was brought by a person claiming as heir; and the lords of the manor, claiming by escheat pro defeotu harredu, applied to be admitted as landlords. After muen discussion, it was entered by consent, that the lord of the manor should bring an ejectment, which the person claiming as heir should defend. Lord Mansfield, alter the rule had been drawn up, declared that he was clear that “ that method was the proper way of trying the right upon the merits: if there was really no heir, then the lord stood la the place of the deceased; hut f there was

any heir whatsoever, the lord's claim was as an end. The Court would have obliged him to come into tome method of trying the right in a proper issue; and that method into which it was now pat (his bringing an ejectment) was the most proper issue for the purpose. If* the heir had refused, the Court would have permitted the lord to defend, which would have given him the benefit of possession. If the lord had refused to consent, the Court would have discharged the rule. For certainly, when the sole question turns upon who ought to be the landlord to the tenant in posse—ion, he should stand neuter, and his possession avail neither: the question ought to be tried between the claimants. The plaintiff most consent, else the Other is admitted to defend: the other must consent, because to say that he is landlord begs the question intended to be tried.'9 —For a reason already stated, it seems dear that this view of the subject cannot now prevail, whatever other course may be taken in order to decide the question of title.

In Lovelock d. Norris v. Doncaster, 3 T. R. 783, an application to defend as landlord being made on behalf of devisees, which was opposed on the ground of their having never been in possession. Lord Kenyon said—“ If the person requiring to be made defendant under the Act had stood in the situation of immediate heir to the person last seized, or had been in the relation of remainder-man under the same title as the original landlord, I am of opinion that he might have been permitted to defend as landlord by virtue of the directions of the statute; but here the very question in dispute between the adverse party and himself is, whether he is entitled to be landlord or not ? and therefore we are not authorized to extend the provisions of the statute to such a case — this."

In Doc on the demise of Hebblethwaite and others v. Roe, cited in a note to the preceding case, the court permitted an heir who had never been in possession to come, in and defend an ejectment. The father under whom he claimed died just before, having first obtained a similar rule. But in this case the ejectment seems to have been brought by a person claiming by title paramount to that of the person who made the lease, and not to involve any

3 Esp. 225, Lord Kenyon held, that if the tenant abandon the premises without notice, the landlord is not precluded from recovering the subsequent rent by putting up a bill at the window, and endeavouring to procure another tenant.

The general proposition that a tenant cannot dispute his landlord's title, is established by several cases, and is now received as an undisputed rule of law. In Cooke v. Loxley, 5 T. R. 4., a tenant of part of the glebe of a parish, who had entered under a former incumbent, and paid rent to the successor, was not, in an action for rent subsequently incurred, al« lowed to dispute the title of the incumbent on the ground of simony, although he alleged that, at the time of the payment, he was ignorant of that objection. In England v. Slade, 4T.R* 682., Lord Kenyon said, and the other judges agreed, that it was competent to the defendant to shew that the lessor's title had expired, and that he had no right to turn him out of possession; but in Bills t. Westwood, 2 Camp. N. P. 11., being an action for use and occupation of a copyhold estate, the defendant offered to shew that the estate had been seised or forfeited to the lord by process out of the court baron, and that, having notice from the steward to pay the rent to the lord, he had done so ever since; which Lord Ellenborough would not allow, saying, “ You cannot controvert the title of the person under whom yon continue to hold. The security of landlords would be infinitely endangered if such n proceeding were permitted. Had the defendant upon the premises being seised by the lord of the manor, disclaimed holding of the plaintiff, and entered afresh under the new landlord, we might now enquire into the validity of the seisnre, and decide who is legally entitled to the premises; but the same tenancy continues which was created by the original aetnbe, and the tenant moat still pay rent to the lessor, whose title he then recognised."

In an action for use and occupation, it boot necessary to set forth the particulars of the demise; Wilkins r. Wingate, 6 T. R. 62., (in debt; but the same holds good in assumpsit); or to state the place where the premises lie; King v. Fraser, 6 T. R. 62.

XV. And whereas where any lessor or landlord* having only an estate for life in the lands* tenements or hereditaments demised, nap- pens to die before or on the day, on which any rent is reserved, or made payable, such rent, or any part thereof, is not by law recoverable by the executors or administrators of such lessor or landlord; nor is the person in reversion entitled thereto, any other than for the use and occupation of such lauds, tenements or hereditaments, from the death of the tenant for life; of which advantage hath been often taken by the under-tenants, who thereby avoid paying any thing for the sameFor remedy whereof be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the twenty-fourth day of June, One thou-seven hundred and thirty-eight, where any tenant for life shall happen to die before or on the day, on which any rent was reserved or made payable upon any demise or lease or any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, which determined on the death of such tenant for life, that the executors or administrators of such tenant for v life shall and may, in an action on the case, recover of and from such under-tenant or under-tenants of such lands, tenements, or hereditaments, if such tenant for life die on the day on which the same was made payable the whole, or if before such day then a proportion, of such rent according to the time such tenant for life lived, of the last year, or quarter or a year, or other time in which the said rent was growing due as aforesaid, making all just allowances or a proportionable part thereof respectively, {\)

of particulars: but if the doctrine was founded on no better reason than that, it would be very unsatisfactory, as it can never be admitted that the rules of pleading, which are part of the law of the land, can be varied by p modern practice, introduced upon the mere authority of the Courts.]

That debt for use and occupation is not local, was also decided in Egler v, Marsden, 5 Taunt 25.

Where the premises were stated to be situate in a pariah which did not exist, Lord Kenyon held it a fatal variance; Wilson r. Clark, I Esp. R. 273; but in Kirtland v. Pounsett, 1 Taunt. 570, the declaration being for use and occupation of premises in the pariah of Lambeth, the real name of the parish being St Mary Lambeth, although the parish was well known by the name of Lambeth, the variance was held immaterial. The question of variance, where the declaration it tied up to a particular description of locality, does not seem to beat all affected by the decision, that no allegation of locality is necessary; although the contrary may perhaps be inferred from the observations of Lawrence J. in the case last referred to.

(l)There is no rule of the law more certain and notorious, than that an entire contract cannot be apportioned; and the doctrine which existed upon the subject previous to the passing of the Act was no more than the application of that general role which still subsists, notwithstanding many efforts to controul it by mere Judicial authority. The hardship upon landlords in cases previous to the statute, or to which the statute does not extend, has been oftenexpatiated upon; but the inconvenience sustained by a tenant, by the sudden determination of ms interest, seems to have been altogether overlooked j and I am not aware that there was any great mason for complaining of a rule, the effect of which could always be obviated by express stipulations. Upon this ground 1 feel by no means disposed to regard with particular estimation the cases in which an effort has been made to cany the provisions of the statute, by analogical reasoning, beyond their fair and natural import and construction.

In Paget v. Gee, Born, tit. Diatreatr. Ambler, 198, the leasee of tenant in tail, whose estate* determined in the middle of a half-year, paid the entire rent to the remainder-man in fee; and Lord Hardwicke decided that the executors of the tenant in tail were entitled to an apportionment. His lordship expressed an opinion that tenant in tail, after possibility of issue extinct, or tenant for years, determinable upon lives, wa# within the Act; gave no absolute opinion as to the case of tenant in tail, but arid, 44 As to the equity arising from the statute, I know no better* nile than this, that equitaa aequitur legem. Where equity finds a rule of law agreeable to conscience, it puisnes the sense of it to analogous cases. If it does so as to the maxims of the common law, why not as to the reasons of Acta of Parliament ? But I ground my opinion in this case upon the tenant having submitted to pay the rent. He has held himself bound in conscience to pay for the use and occupation of the land the last half-year. He pud It to the defendant, which he was not bonnd in law to do; and in such case the person he pays it to shall be accountable, and considered as receiving it for those who are in equity entitled.”—I am not aware of any passages in onr judicial annals which appear to me more exceptionable than the first of those that have been just extracted. The argument is, that because courts of equity, in their general reasonings, are guided by the analogy of the common law, they shall be admitted to assume an authority - to outrun the legislature in the positive alteration of the law;

other charges which became due after the death of tenant for life, should be sustained by the remainder-man, or be apportioned? The Master of the Rolls said, the statute 11 Geo. II. has no application to this case. It might be very reasonable to make such a statute, as to the apportionment of taxes between the tenant for life and the remainder-man, giving the tenant for life the benefit only as against thfe tenant under the lease.—In a view of the law of apportionment, introduced into the Appendix to the Translation of Pothier, (p. 47.) it occurred to me to observe that this Act •tops short of its probable object, in not including the case of a tenant for the life of another person, whose estate determines by the death of such other person; and that if an ecclesiastical person makes a lease, and vacates 'his preferment by the acceptance of another, I conceived that there could be no apportionment. The case of tenant pur autre vie has been since incidentally noticed in the case of Wykham r. Wykham, 3 Taunt. 331, in which, with reference to some observations of counsel, Mansfield C. J. said—“ Has it ever been determined that the executor of a tenant pur autre vie is entitled to recover a portion of the lent from the last quarter-day under the statute ? He is certainly within the mischief, for otherwise the tenant of the land may keep the rent Aw his own benefit.” To use the language of the M*ter of the Rolls, it might be very reasonable to make a statute for the purpose:but certainly the language of the present statute will not admit of such an interpretation;

- and it would be much better, until there is another, to let the inconvenience remain as it is, than to allow the assumption of that judicial legislation, of which it is more easy to check the beginning, than to calculate the end.

In the case of Earl Strafford v. Wentworth, Prec. Ch. 555, a tenant for life had made leases, some of which, being under a power, had continuance after his death; and others not being according to his power, determined with his life, and died on the rent day, about 12

o'clock at noon; and Lord Macclesfield held, that the latter belonged to his executors, because, although for the benefit of the tenants, they had, to the last instant of the day, to nay the rents; yet as soon as the day began, they were at their peril to take care that they were pud accordingly; but as to the lease made by virtue of the power, they had existence and continuance after the death of the lessor, and thus the rent went along with the reversion, t# those who were entitled to it In Lord Rockingham v. Penricc, 1 P. Wms. 177, the tenant for life died before sun-set, and it was held that the person in remainder was entitled to the rents that became due that day. One tenant had paid his rent to the tenant for life in the morning, and it was held, that though this .was a good payment to discharge the tenant, the executors should account for it to the party in remainder. Upon thia point the reporter makes a query; for if the payment was a good payment at law, as it certainly was, why must it not be so in equity ? A case was cited before Tracey J. at Durham, where the executor of a grantee for life of a rent-charge, who died after sun-set on the day was held entitled. See Duppa v. Mayo, 1 Saund. 287., in which it was held, as between heirs and executors of tenant in fee, that where the lessor died after sun-set, and before midnight, (the rent not being previously paid) the heir was entitled.

(lj Where a tenant ceased to reside on the premises for several months, and left them without nay furniture, or sufficient other property to answer the year's rent; held that the land might be properly proved under s. 16. to recover the possession, although he knew where the tenant then was, ana although the justices - found a servant of the tenant on the premises, when they first went to view the same: held also that it is not necessary, to state, in the record of the magistrates’ proceedings, that the landlord had a right of re-entry; although such a right must exist in order to entitle the party to proceed under that statute; Ex parte Pilton, I B. & A. 369.

their agents; the distress itself shall not be deemed to be unlawful, nor the party or parties making it be therefore deemed a trespasser or trespassers ab initio t (1) but the party or parties aggrieved by such unlawful Act or irregularity shall or may recover full satisfaction for the special damage, he, she. or they shall nave sustained thereby, and no more, in any action or trespass, or (2) on the case at the election of the plaintiff or plaintiffs: Provided nlwaya. That where the plaintiff or plaintiffs shall recover in such action, he, she, or they shall be paid his, her, or their full costs of suit, and have all the like remedies for the same as in other cases of costs.

XX. Provided nevertheless, That no tenant or tenants, lessee or lessees, shall recover in any action for any such unlawful Act or irregularity as aforesaid, if tender of amends hath been made by the party or parlies distraining, his, her, or their agent or agents, before such action brought.

XXI. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twenty-fourth day of June One thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight, in all actions of trespass or upon the case to be brought against any person or persons entitled to rents or services of any kind, his, her, cr their bailiff or receiver, or other person or persons relating to any entry by virtue of this Act, or otherwise, upon the premises chargeable with such rents or services, or to any distress or seizure, sale or disposal of any goods or chattels thereupon; it shall and may be lawful to and for the defendant or defendants in such actions to plead the general issue, and give the special matter in evidence; any law or usage to the contrary notwithstanding: And in case the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action shall become nonsuit, discontinue his, her, or their action, or have judgment against him, her, or them, the defendant or defendants shall recover doable costs (3) of suit.

XXII. And whereas great difficulties often arise in making avowries or conuzance upon distresses for "rent, quit-rents, reliefs, heriots, and other services; 1 Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twenty-fourth day of June One thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight, it snail and may be lawful to and for all defendants in replevin to avow or make conuzance generally, (4) that the plaintiff in replevin, or other tenant of the lands and tenements whereon such distress was made, eiyoyed the same under a grant or demise (t) at such a certain rent (6) during the time wherein the rent distrained for

11) Trespass may be maintained where the defendant expels the plaintiff from the premises and keeps possession after the rent paid; Etherton v. Popple well, ] East, 139. So where the defendants continued in possession eleven days before they began to remove the goods, and were then employed four days in removing them; but whether the action was sustainable for the mere continuance, or on account of the taking and removing of the goods from the premises, and disturbing the plaintiff's possession after the time when they ought to be removed, was not agreed. Lord Ellenborough and Grose J. ruled the case on this latter ground, as distinguished from the former. Lc Blanc J., assented to the action being maintainable on that ground, but he did not wish to be precluded from saying in a subsequent case, that a party might be a trespasser by continuing on the premises wrongfully. Bayley J. held, mat trespass for the wrongful continuance was the proper remedy, and that the other ground could not be supported. Winterbourne v. Morgan, 11 East, 395.

For an irregularity in the subsequent disposition (as in selling without proper appraisement) trover cannot be maintained since the

statute, as it tends to plnce the landlord in the same situation as before, by considering him a trespasser ab initios Wallace v. King, 1 H. B. 13.

(2) Lord Ellenborough did not consider this as giving the plaintiff an option which remedy to pursue, in every case of an unlawful Act or irregularity, but merely an option according to the subject matter of the grievance; Winter-bourne v. Morgan, ub. supra,

(3) It is not nccessaiy that there should be either a certificate from a judge, or a suggestion on the roll, in order to entitle a defendant to double costs on this Act; Finlay v, Seaton, -1 Taunt. 210.

(4) The defendant cannot plead generally it injuria propria in bar of such avowry; Jones e. Kitchen, 1 B. and P. 76.

(5) The Act does not extend to an avowry for a rent charge; Bulpit v. Clarke, 1 N. R. 56; or to a rent under a £ anal Act, in satisfaction for damages, and charged on the rates; but only to the rent directly reserved by a landlord on his grant, on demise of land theretofore made; Leominster Canal e. Cowell, 1 B. and P., 213.

(6) An avowry for rent of and an inGJftss XIX.] Distress? Replevin, Sfc. 181

incurred, which rent was then and still remains dues or that the place No. XXIII. where the distress was taken was parcel of such certain tenements, held «i George II* of .such honour, lordship, or manor, for which tenements the rent, .J

relief, heriot, or other service distrained for, (1) dras at the time of such distress and still remains due, without further setting forth the grant, tenure, demise, or title, of such landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, owner or owners of such manor; any law or usage to the contrary notwithstanding: And if the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action shall become nonsuit, discontinue his, her, or their action, or have judgment given against him, her or them, the defendant or defendants in such replevin (2) shall recover double costs of suit. (9)

XXIII. And to prevent vexatious replevins of distresses taken for Topreventvex-rent. Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the atious reple said twenty-fourth day of June One thousand seven hundred and thirty- vim. eight, all sheriffs, and other officers having authority to grant replevins, may and shall in every replevin of a distress for rent, take in their own names, from the plaintiff, and two responsible (4) persons as sureties, a bond in double the value of the goods distrained (5) (such value to be ascertained by the oath of one or more credible witness or witnesses not interested in the goods or distress, which oath the person granting such replevin is hereby authorized and required to administer), and conditioned for prosecuting the suit (6) with effect and without delay, and for duly returning the goods and chattels distrained in casern return Replevin bonds shall be awarded, before any deliverance be made of the distress; and maybe assign-that such sheriff, or other officer as aforesaid, taking any such bond, ed.

creased rent of /. for every acre converted into tillage is sdpported by a demise for 21 years, with a reservation of the advanced rent during the last three years; and for which advanced rent during those three years the distress was made. It was objected that the avowry ought either to have been general under the statute, or special as at common law, whereby the avowant was bound to an exact statement of bis title in omnibus-; and that in the present case it was neither; Roulston v. Clarke, 2 H. B. 593.

(1) If a less rent was due than is avowed for, the avowant may recover for so much as is due; Harrison r. Barnby, 5 T. R. 248; Forty v. 1m-ber, 6 East, 434.

(2) The statute 11 Geo. 2. c. 19. s. 22. gives doable costs against a plaintiff in replevin only in three cases, viz, where he is nonsuit; discontinues his action; or has judgment given against him. And, therefore, where in replevin, the cause then not bcin£ at issue, the parties agreed by bond to submit the question to arbitration, the costs to abide the event, and the arbitrator afterwards awarded in favor of defendant, it was held that he is not entitled to double costs under the statute; Gurney v. Bul-ler, 1 B. and A. 670.

(3) In an avowry for distress, damage feasant, it is still necessary to set out the person’s title in pleading. In Scilly v. Dally, 2 Salk. 562, Holt, C. J. called this an established rule in pleading, which was not to be broken upon fancied inconveniences. A practice had begun to prevail of avowing generally that the defendant was lawfully possessed of the locus in quo. Such pleas have been ruled to be bad in Hawkins v. Eckles, 2 B. and P. 359, of which Serjeant Williams observes, in note to 2 Saund. 284, that the Court of Conunon Pleas it was hoped had thereby put an effectual stop to such

an innovation. The judgment of the case was evidently correct and conformable to the established rules of pleading; but I am far from joining the learned Serjeant in his hopes, if intenaed to apply to a legislative provision upon the subject, for it certainly is no fancied inconvenience that a person in the peaceable possession of land, and having in respect of such possession an undisputed right of maintaining an action of trespass, should be subjected to the inconvenience of a precise statement of his title, in order to avail himself of his legal remedy against an acknowledged wrong-doer.

(4) The sheriff is accountable for the sufficiency of the sureties in such bond, as also for the sufficiency of. the pledgefe under stat. West. 2. c. 2. ante, No. 6. And an action on the case may be maintained for the insufficiency of such sureties or pledges; B. N. P. 60. In such action the sheriff is only liable to the amount for which the sureties would have been liable if sufficient; Yea v, Lethbridge, 4 T. R. 433; Evans r. Brander, 2 H. B. 547; which latter case overrules Concannen v, Lethbridge, id, 36; whereby it was he^A that the damages might exceed the penalty of the bond and cover the rent and expenses. The action ought to be brought by the person making cognizance if there is no avowant on the record; Page v. Earner, 1 B. and P. 378. The court will-not, on motion, order the officer to pay the costs of the replevin; Tcssey-?n*n v. Giidart, 1 N. R. 292.

(5) The two sureties are only liable to the amount of the penalty in the bond and costs of suit against themselves; Hefford v, Alger, 1 Taunt. £18.

(6) If the plaint be removed by re: fa: la: the condition extends to prosecuting the suit with effect in the superior court.

110.2. c. 19. Act for the more effectual securing the Payment of Rents, and preventing Frauds bp Tenants, it is amongst other things enacted. That from aad after the twenty-fourth day of June One thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight, if any tenant holding any lands, tenements, or hereditaments at a rack-rent, or where the rent reserved should be full three-fourths of the yearly value of the demised premises, who should he is arrear for one year's rent, should desert the demised premises, and leave the same uncultivated or unoccupied, so as no sufficient distress could be had to countervail the arrears of rent, it should and might be lawful to and for two or more justices of the peace of the county, riding, division, or place (having no interest in the demised premises), at the request of the lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, or his, her, or their bailiff or receiver, to go upon and view the same, and to affix or cause to be affixed on the most notorious part of the premises notice in writing what day (at the distance of fourteen days at least) they would return to take a second view thereof; and if upon such second view the tenant, or some person on his or her behalf, should not appear and pay the rent in arrear, or there should not be sufficient^istress upon the pre* mises, then the said justices might put the landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, into the possession of the said demised premises; and the lease thereof to such tenant, as to any demise therein contained only, should from thenceforth become void: And whereas it is expedient, for the dne protection of the interest of landlords, that so much of the said Act as' requires a tenant to be in arrear for one year's rent should be altered, and that the provisions of the said Act should be extended to tenancies . where no right of entry in case of non-payment is reserved to the landlord; be it therefore enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,

(1) Qu*re, Whether a bond taken by the sheriff upon malting replevin, but not in all points conformably to the directions of the statute, 11 Geo. 2. c. 19, be assignable ? Austen v, Howard, 7 Taunt. 327.

(2) In Dias, Assignee, v. Freeman, 5 T. R. 191, the breach was for not appearing at the county court; and upon demurrer It was insisted that the assignment could only be made to the avowant, or person making cognizance; but it was ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to an assignment as a person who would have made cognisance but for the neglect of the defendant.

The assignment may be to the avowant only, without joiningthe person making cognizance; Archer v. Dudley, 1 B. and P. 381. n.

(3) The action on the bond may be in a superior court, although the suit was never removed out of the county court. It was observed that the words were the same as those in 4XXAnne, c. 16, for assigning hail bonds, upon which the action must he brought in the same court as the action in which the bond was taken; Dias v.

TVHERKAS, an Act, intituled, An Act for Ea$e fit Pleading against troublesome and contentious Suits prosecuted against Justices of

ike Peace, Mayors, Constables, and certain other his Majesty's Officers, *for the lawful Execution of their Office, made in the Seventh Year of Ms Majesty's most happy Reign of England, was made to continue but

for seven years, and from thence to the end of the next Parliament,

after the said seven years, which by experience hath since been found

to be a good and profitable law ; f

II. Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That the said Act shall, from and after the end of this present session of Parliament, be perpetual, and have continuance for ever.

III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all churchwardens, and all persons called sworn men, executing the office of churchwardens, and all overseers of the poor, and all others which in their aid and assistance, or by their commandment, shall do any thing touching or concerning his or their office or offices, shall hereafter be enabled to receive and have such benefit and help by virtue of the said Act, to all intents, constructions, and purposes, as if they had been specially named therein.

[No. III. 1 21 George II. c. 44.—An Act for the rendering Justices of the Peace more safe in the Execution of their Office; and for indemnifying Constables and others acting in obedience to their Warrants.

WHEREAS justices of the peace are discouraged in the execution of their office by vexatious actions brought against them for or by reason of small and involuntary errors in their proceedings: And whereas it is necessary that they should he (as far as is consistent with justice, and the safety and liberty of the subjects over whom their authority extends) rendered safe in the execution of the said office and trust: And whereas it is also necessary that the subject should be protected from all wilful and oppressive abuse of the several laws and statutes committed to the care and execution of the said justices of the peaceBe it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the twenty-fourth d?y of Jane, One thousand seven hundred and fifty-one, no writ shall be sued oat (I) against, nor any copy of any process, at the suit of a subject, shall be served on any justice of the peace for any thing by him done in the execution of his office, (8) until notice in writing of such intended writ (3)

(1) After opposite decisions upon the subject it Is now settled that the Act does not extend to actions of replevin. See Fletcher v. Wilkins, 6 East. 283, where the question is very felly discussed.

(2) In Weller v. Toke, 3 East. 364, this was ruled to extend to an action against a justice of peace, for a commitment without the concurrence of another justice, in a case where such concurrence was necessary. And by Lord Ellenborough, —44 It is not denied that the defendant had authority to act as a magistrate upon the subject matter of the complaint brought before him, though he could not act alone. Though, the act of commitment, therefore, cannot be said to be done by virtue of his office, yet the subject-matter was within his jurisdiction, and he intended to act as a magistrate at the time, however mistakenly. The very object of the legislature, in requiring the notice to be given was, to enable the magistrate to tender amends as for the wrong done, con templating him as a wrong-doer. If this hsd been an act wholly alien to his jurisdiction, 1 should have said that he acted without the protection of the law.”

II. And be it further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful to and be may tender

nefit of the Act. And per Curuun, —“ The Act was clearly intended to protect such officers, as acting in the bona Jtde discharge of their duty were inadvertently guilty of excesses beyond the strict line of their duty, and though the defendant’s conduct was perhaps too hasty, yet it manifestly appears that he acted in the supposed execution of his office, however illegally; and that Is sufficient to bring the case within the protection of the statute. The lord of a manor, who is also a Justice of peace, is entitled to notice in an action for taking away a gun from an unqualified person, as it will be presumed that he acted as a justice; Biggs v. Evelyn, 2 H. B. 114. And in Greenaway v. Hurd, 4 T. R. 555, Lord Kenyon said, —“ It has been frequently observed by the courts, that the notice directed to be given to justices and other officers, is of no use to them when they have acted within the strict line of their duty, and was only required for the purpose of protecting them when they intended to act within it, but by mistake exceeded it.* ’

(1) The day of service is included in the time. Notice given on the 28th of April of an action commenced on the 28th.of May ia sufficient; Castle v. Burditt, 3 T. R. 623.

(2) Notice of an action on the case for false imprisonment is not sufficient when the action is brought in trespass, per Yates J.; Strickland v. Ward, 7 T. R. 631.

(3) In the notice required to be given to magistrates within 24 Geo.

(4) Given under my hand at Durham, is not a sufficient notice of a residence at Durham. The statute has presented a form which must be implicitly followed, and it admits of no equivalent; Taylor v.

(2) An overseer executing a warrant of distress for a poor’s rate is an officer within the Act; Nutting v. Jackson, B. N. P. 24; Harper v. Cirri 7 T. R. 270.

(3) An officer is not within the Act who arrests a wrong person; Money v.

(4) If the warrant by a justice of the county

is executed in a franchise out of the justice's jurisdiction, the officer is not entitled to the benefit of the Act; Milton v. Green, 5 East, 233. The constable is entitled to the benefit of

KMWHEREAS persons bolding and exercising public employments

1 out of Great Britain often escape punishment for offences committed by them, for want of courts having a sufficient jurisdiction, in

in Great Britain for such offences as the law now stands, in as much

as such offences cannot be laid to have been committed within the body of any county: Aod whereas it is therefore expedient that such and the like provisions as are contained in an Act passed in the eleventh and twelfth years Of the'rfeign of his late Majesty King IVUUam the Third, intituled, 44 An Act to punish governors or plantations of this kingdom for crimes by them committed in the plantations, ” and in an Act passed in the thirteenth year of the reign of his present Majesty, 4 intituled, 44 An Act for establishing certain regulations for the better management of the affairs of the East India Company, as well in India as in Europeand in an Act passed in the twenty-fourth year of the reign of his presept Majesty, intituled, “ An Act for the better regulation and management of the affairs of the East India Company, and of the British possessions in India, and for the establishing a. court of judicature for the more speedy and effectual trial of persons accused of offences committed in the East Indies, ” should be extended and applied to the punishment of such offenders May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act, if any person who now is, or heretofore has been, or shrflY hereafter be employed by or in the service of his Majesty, his heirs or successors, in any civil or military station, office, or capacity out of Great Britain, or snail heretofore have had, held, or exercised, or now has, holds, or exercises, or shall hereafter have, hold, or exercise any public station, office, capacity, or employment, out of Great Britain, shall have committed, or shall commit, or shall have heretofore been, or is, or shall hereafter be guilty of any crime, misdemeanor, dr offence, in the execution, or under colour, or in the exercise of any such station, office, capacity, or employment as aforesaid, every such crime, oflfence, or misdemeanor may be prosecuted or inquired of, and heard and determined in his Majesty’s Court of King's Bench here in Engtand, either upon an information exhibited by his Majesty’s Attor-tiey-general, or Upon an indictment found; in which information or indictment such crime, offence, or misdemeanor may be laid and charged to have been committed in the county of Middlesex; and all such persons so offending, and also all persons tried under any of the provisions of the said recited Act, passed in the reign of King IVUUam aforesaid, or this Act, or either of them, for any offence, crime, or misdemeanor, and not having been before tried for the same otat of Great Britain, shall on conviction, be liable to such punishment as may, by any law or laws now in force, or any Act or Acts that may hereafter be passed, be inflicted for any such crime, misdemeanor, " or offence committed in England} and shall also be liable, at the discretion of his Majesty’s Court of King’s Bench, to be adjudged to be incapable of .serving .his Majesty in any station, office, or capacity, civil or military, or of holding or exerasing any public employment whatever.

Penal Actions and Informations.

Thb following note upon the general subject of penal actions was subjoined by the Editor to the case of Kirkham r. Wheeley, 1 Salk. 30, 6th Edition.

An action q. t. is the suit of the informer, not of the King; Lut. 196. A plaintiff pet tam tony be nonsuited; 3 Ley. 398; Sav. 56. Upon such nonsuit the defendant is entitled to costa against 1dm; Wilkinson, q. t. a. Allot, Cowp. 366. The Court will not in a penal action stay proceedings until costs of a non pro*. at the suit of another plaintiff, are paid; English, q. t. v. Cox, Cowp. 322: nor upon affidavit, that a former action was brought for the same offence, which the defendant had leave to compound; the fact must be specially pleaded; Harrington q. t 9. Johnson, Cowp. 744. Proceedings will be stayed on motion until the plaintiff gives notice of his place of abode, and, if he u out of the realm, security for costs; Val. v. Green, Str. 697. Actions on penal statutes are expressly excepted in stat. 4XXAnne, c. 16, which allows double pleading; and it has been accordingly adjudged, that in them the defendant cannot plead double; Heyrick v. Foster *, 4 T. R. 701. A plea of another action commenced the same term must set forth that it was commenced prior; Combe v. Pitt, 3 Burr. 1423; 1 Bl. 437. Informations on penal statutes are excepted in the statutes of amendment; but there is no difference

between civil and penal actions with respect to amendments at common law; Baldwin v.--,

Bunb. 49; Brooke v. Day, Bunb. 336; Edgell v. Decker, Bunb. 252; Wynne v. Middleton-, Str. 1227; 1 Wils. 256; Bonfield, q. t. v. Milner, 2 Burr. 1098; Mace v. Lovett, 5 Burr. 2833; Richards v. Brown, Doug. 113. The Court will not set aside a judgment of non pro *, regularly obtained against a mere common informer suing for punishment; but it might be otherwise, if the party really injured sued for justice and reparation; 1 Burr. 401. Where a q. t. Action has been depending four years, an amendment will not be permitted though all is in paper; Goff v. Popplewell, 2T. R. 707. In a popular action on two counts for two bl. penalties, the defendant had leave to pay 5A. into Court generally; Stock v. Eagle, 2 Bl. Rep. 1052. If there appears reason to suspect that the action is brought merely for the sake of the issue-money, that will be ordered to be paid into Court to abide the event of the suit; Parker, q. t. v. Macfarlan, 3 T. R. 137. The defendant may have nisi prhu by proviso; 2 Leon - 110. A Quaker's evidence is admissible in a penal action; Atchison v. Everett, Cowp. 382. If the q. t. informer die after a verdict, his executor or administrator shall have judgment for his moiety; Hard. 161:If he dies after judgment, and his death is suggested on the roll; Conu Dig. action upon stat. E. 2. New trial may be granted for the mistake or misdirection of the judge, but not for the wrong conclusion or the jury after verdict for the defendant; Wilson v, Rastall, 4 T. R. 753. If the action is for several penalties, and the jury give a verdict generally for one, which the plaintiff applies to a particular count, and that cannot be supported, he cannot afterwards apply it to another, which is good and sufficiently supported by evidence; Holloway, a. t. v. Bennett, 3 T. R. 448. The defendant in a q. t, action cannot be discharged upon surrendering his effects under the Lords' Act; Harl, q. t. v, Hawkins, 3 Burr. 1322; 1 Bl. 372. The defendant cannot be taken in execution on a Sunday; Rex v. Myers, 1T.R. 265.

[No. II. J 24 Edward I.—In what Case a Consultation is grantable.

llWHEREAS ecclesiastical judges have often surceased to proceed in causes moved before them, by force of the King's writ of

prohibition, in cases wherein remedy could not be given to com plainants in the King's court, by any writ out of the Chancery, 44 whereby such plaintiffs were deferred of their right and remedy m 44 both courts, as well temporal as spiritual, to their great damage, like as the King hath been advertised by the grievous complaint of his subjects:" 4 Our Lord the King willeth and commandeth, That where ecclesiastical judges do surcease in the aforesaid cases, by the King's 4 prohibition directed unto them, that the chancellor or the chief justice of our Lord the King for the time being, upon sight of the libel of the same matter, at the instance of the plaintiff (if they can see that the case cannot be redressed by any writ out of the Chancery, but that the spiritual court ought to determine the matters) shall write to the ecclesiastical judges, before whom the cause was first moved, that they proceed therein, notwithstanding the King's prohibition directed to them before.9

Understand ye, 44 That whereas of late times of our progenitors sometimes Kings of England, in divers their parliaments, and likewise after that we had undertaken the governance of the realm, in our parliaments many articles containing divers grievances (committed as therein was said against the Church of England, the prelates and clergy) were pro pounded by the prelates and clerks or our realm $ and further, great instance was made that convenient remedy might be provided therein: 44 And of late in our Parliament holden at Lincoln, the ninth year of our reign, we caused the articles underwritten, with certain answers made to some of them heretofore, to be rehearsed before our council, and made certain answers to be corrected $ and to the residue of the articles underwritten, answers were made by us and our council! J 44 of which said articles, with the answers of the same, the tenors here ensue."

That in tythes, oblations, obventions,

4 mortuaries (when they are propounded under these names) the King's 4 prohibition shall hold no place, although for the long withholding of the same, - the money may be esteemed at a sum certain. Bat if a1 4 clerk or a religions man.do sell his tythes being gathered in his boro, 4 or otherwise, to any man for money, if the money be demaoded before 4 a spiritual judge, the King's prohibition shall lie for by the sale the spiritual goods are made temporal, and the tythes turned into chattels.

[No. XXVI.] 47 George III. st. 2. c. 74.—An Act for more effectually securing the Payment of the Debts of Traders. *—f 14th August 1807.]

This Act was introduced on the motion of a gentleman, to whom the country is particularly indebted for the attention which he has devoted, in numerous instances, to the general improvement and amelioration of a legislative system, but whose efforts for that purpose have excited no common portion of opposition.

In the preceding Session of Parliament, he had endeavoured to introduce a general enactment for subjecting freehold property to the payment of simple contract debts; a proposal which act with a strong, and, as it is well known, a successful opposition in the House of Commons; in which a number of persons of high professional rank, and whose juridical talents and character are of the most superior order, took a principal share. Upon the failure of that proposal, the present more limited measure was introduced, and was suffered, as Vol. IP. X

for as my recollection serves, to pass without any material opposition. The general proposal has been since several times renewed. Upon the first occasion it encountered a considerable opposition in the House of Commons, from different members connected with the profession of the law, but received the sanction of a majority of the House, and was afterwards more successfully resisted in the House of Lords. In the Session of Parliament which ia still continuing (55 George III.), it was suffered to pass the Commons without comment or observation; and I had contemplated, with some satisfaction, the probability of including an enactment by which it had been carried into effect in the present collection: but it has again failed, after a short and summary discussion in the House of Lords.

In the ephemeral accounts of the proceedings which took place upon its introduction, I

RflLWHEREAS it is expedient that the payment of the debts of per-47 Geo III* W sons in trade should be secured more effectually than is done by .g 74 ' ^e laws now in forced Be it therefore enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That, from and after the passing of this Act, when any person, being at the time of his death a

noticed a declaration of the learned member whose exertions upon the subject have been hitherto unsuccessnil, that if the measure was rejected upon that occasion, he should never afterwards come forward as its proposer; but, from the brief view which has been taken of the subject, it is evident that considerable progress- has been made in removing the feelings of repugnance by which the proposed alteration of the law has been hitherto resisted; and a period may perhaps arrive, when the attention of the legislature may be again called to the subject, with the reasonable hope and prospect of a different result.

Feeling as 1 do, upon a long and habitual consideration of the question, that no alteration of the law would be more important and salutary in its consequences, I propose to dilate upon the subject with some degree of particularity; but conscious that those, by the influence of whose opinions the change has been hitherto successfully resisted, are the persons who by their stations, their learning and-their respectability, are most peculiarly qualified to challenge whatever deference and assent can be justly paid to the names and characters of individuals, 1 trust that, in the freedom of discussion, 1 shall not forget the language or sentiments of respect.

1 hope it will not be a deviation from the profession which I have made, to avow, that 1 do not consider a general and indiscriminate appeal to the wisdom of our ancestors, and an equally general and unqualified invective on the dangers of innovation, as arguments which can have much weight in the scale of rational inquiry. I am as well aware as those from whom I most differ in opinion with regard to the present question, of the advantage of adhering to an established and existing system, until strong and adequate reasons appear to justify or require a deviation from it. But the mere and indiscriminate reliance upon the topics which have been alluded to, is not so much calculated to command assent, as to a).isle enquiry; and the principle of opposition which they import is equally applicable to all proposals whatever, and however beneficial or injurious they may happen individually to be: and if this sentiment and been at all times attended with the same commanding influence which it at present seems to possess, it would have presented an insuperable obstacle to the mo*t salutary and beneficial improvements which have taken place in our legislative system; and in no instance more strongly and decidedly so, than in the general abolition of those feudal tenures, of which the subsisting law upon the immediate matter in discussion was manifestly the emanation and result.

Of the moral obligation of individuals to discharge the engagements which they have contracted, there can only be one opinion j and as little doubt can be entertained of the general propriety of giving to such obligation the force and sanction of law, when the nature of the subject will admit, and there arc no adequate reasons of public utility to the contrary.

Accordingly, in all countries, the enforcing the performance of contracts, and more particularly the discharge of debts recognized by the law, is a very prificipal object of jurisprudence; and no person, either morally or legally speaking, is considered as the real owner of property to a greater amount than that which exceeds the total amount of his obligations:and the real question under consideration is, whether there are any adequate motives of civil policy for conferring on those who may succeed, by reason of death, to the rights of the deceased in property and advantage in respect of particular effects, an exemption which did not belong to the author of their claim; for casting a benefit upon the representative which could not have been enjoyed by the persons whom he represents; and for giving an adventitious gain without any claim of merit, and resulting from the loss and detriment of those who are not chargeable with any greater culpability than the want of sufficient acuteness and vigilance in the preservation of their own immediate interests ? The mamma which, though forming part of a particular system of jurisprudence, are manifestly founded upon principles of universal application—“ Hoe nm-tura erqtmm estt neminem ear alteriu* detriment* et ityuria locupletiorem fieri; * and, “ Melius est favere repetition* quam adventitio kero.” will, by every unsophisticated mind, be ad-- mitted to supply the general rule; and the enquiry is reduced to an examination of the motives which are considered as sufficient to warrant an exception.

1 do not rely upon any other system of law as an absolute authority; but conceive it is an argument of no inconsiderable weight, that we are not acquainted with any other system of jurisprudence, in which the whole property of a person deceased was not subject to answer the whole amount of his debts.

According to the Roman law, the persons who fell within the description of tui et nects-tarii fuerede*t being the issue of the deceased, remaining under lus authority, and not emancipated, could not renounce the character of heirs, and were strictly chargeable with the debts; but by the prstorian law, which'was analogous to our system of equity, such heirs were permitted to abstain from the inheritance.

and thereby release themselves from the obligation. See Institutes, lib. 2. tit. 19. Other persons, denominated exteranii hared* whether instituted by will or taking by intestacy, had a certain period for deliberation; but if they accepted the inheritance, they were chargeable with the obligations of the deceased, without regard to the amount of his effects. The Emperor Gordian introduced an exception in favour of soldiers, who, if they incautiously took upon themselves the succession, were liable only to the extent of the property; and Justinian extended this privilege to all persons in general by law. Code, lib. 6. tit. 30, de Jure deliberandi, law 22; whereby he introduced. the benefit of inventory, under which, if the heir, within thirty days, began with proper formalities to make an inventory of the estate of the deceased, and completed it within sixty days more, he was only chargeable with the amount of the property belonging to*the deceased. The period was extended to a year in case of the absence of the heir. In case the inventory was not made within the term and in the manner prescribed, the heir was deemed to have accepted the succession generally, and was liable, without distinction, to the debts of the deceased. And this system has been followed in most of the modern states of Europe which have adopted the -general principle of the Roman law. Such was the law of France previous to the Revolution, although differently modified in different provinces. In the more recent code several very judicious regulations are adopted, with respect to the manner of taking mid verifying the inventory of the property. The i

i same law prevailed in the United States; Vinnius ad Inst. 2, 19. It is part of the Prussian code; Part 2, B. 7, tit. 15. It is the law of Scotland; Erskine's Principles, B. 3, tit. 8. By the general law of Germany, the heir is not bound beyond the amount of the successions, although he has not made an inventory j He-necciusEl. Juris Germanicibut in no country, except our own, does it appear to have been the law, that the property of the deceased should be enjoyed without being subject to the charge of his obligations. In most of the countries which have been mentioned, the feudal system, from which the exemption of lands in England is evidently derived, remained So vigour, with reference to the exercise of seignunral rights, long after its direct operation had, in this country, been put an end to by legislative authority.

With regard to the progress of the law connected with this subject, in our own country, it Is manifest that, in the early periods of our history, the transactions of commerce were of

very limited importance, and that the ability to perform the feudal services was the object principally regarded by the law, with respect to the tenure of lands; bpt as the magnitude and consideration of subjects connected with personal property and contracts advanced, the legislature shewed a corresponding disposition to support their consequence. The introduction of the writ of elegit, subjecting the moiety of lands to execution in satisfaction of judgments, by the statute of 13 Ed. I. at a period when feudal tenures and services retained their primary importance, was a bold deviation from the subsisting law, and a manly sacrifice of prejudice to justice. The same spirit was evinced by the Institution of Statutes Merchant in the same year, and of Statutes Staple in the reign of Ed. III.; and was carried to a greater extent by 23 Henry VIII. which extended the benefit of the Statute Staple to all the King’s subjects in general.

The reign of Henry Vlll. is al&9 distinguished by two other important novelties; or, as perhaps they would be called by those who in that day were fearful of calling in question the wisdom of their ancestors, innovations— the Statute of Wills, by which a person was enabled voluntarily to do justice to the claims of his creditors, in subjecting his lands to the payment of debts; and the introduction of the bankrupt law.

The Statute 34 and 35 Henry Vlll. c. 4, by which this last important alteration in the law was established, gave power to certain great officers of state “ to take order respecting the bodies, land* and goods of those who, craftily obtaining Into their hands great substance of other men's goods, do suddenly flee to parts unknown, or keep their houses, not minding to pay or restore to any their creditors their duties, but at their own wills and pleasures consume the substance obtained by credit of other men for their own pleasure and delicate living, against all reason, equity and good conscience."

It is observable that this Act is not confined, like the more recent Statutes respecting bankruptcy, to the case of persons engaged in trade# of a particular character and description, but is generally applicable to all debtors whatever: and notwithstanding all the commendation which may have been bestowed upon later Statutes, on account of their more confined and limited operation in this respect, I cannot but think, that the generality of the original Statute was more conformable to the principles of justice and utility.—See Letter to Sir Samuel Romilly, (subjoined to Class XXVIII. post.)

bath and James upon the subject of bankruptcy seems to bare been to frame, with respect to the persons who were the objects of those statutes, a more detailed and particular provision for giving effect to the important principles established by the Statute of Henry

It is not material, for the present purpose, to advert more particularly to these statutes, than to observe that, when personal transactions and engagements were, as compared to the present penod, in their infancy, and the old -relations of lord and tenant, though of diminished, were of considerable importance, the relief of creditors was considered as a matter of so much consequence, that not only the freehold and copyhold estates were subjected to the operation of the bankrupt law, but that, by the Statute of 21 Jac. I. all estates tail, of which the bankrupt had the power of disposition, were also placed in the same predicament.

The next provision which it occurs to me to notice is that in the Statute of Frauds, subjecting trust estates to the payment of specialty debts. This was succeeded by the Statute against fraudulent demises, 3 and Wil? liam and Mary, c. 14, which, giving the same remedy to a specialty creditor against a devisee as against an heir, so far favours the general object of charging lands with the payment of simple contract debts, as to make an exception in respect of lands devised for the payment of any just debts j and the Courts of Equity, in supporting the provisions of the exception, have shewn a disposition to place specialty and simple contract creditors upon an equal footing, by not permitting the former to derive any benefit from a general devise for the satisfaction of debts, until the latter have been placed upon an equal footing with them, in respect of the gatisfhetion received from the personal assets.

The disposition to favour the subjecting real estate to the payment of debts was further manifested by the Statute 25 Geo. II. c. 6, by which, in consequence of the doubts that had existed respecting the term credible witnesses in the Statute of Frauds, it is provided, that creditors who had attested or should thereafter attest wills, charging lands with the payment of debts, should be admitted as witnesses to such wills.

The same spirit prevailed in the compulsory clauses of 32 George II. c. 5, (usually called the Lords* Act) and the several Acts for the extension thereof, by which debtors in execution are compellable, at the instance of their creditors, to make a conveyance of all their property, under pain of transportation. It would nave seemed to be a more commodious course to have given an immediate remedy against the property itself. I remember an

instance at Chester Assizes, of a person receiving sentence of transportation, for obstinately refusing to comply with the provisions of this Act.

The Statute to which this Note is subjoined completes the series of legislative enactments connected with the subject under discussion.

The courts of justice have certainly been in no wise backward ingivingfull effect to all the dispositions, either of the law itself, or of individual testators, in favour of the general object which is the subject of consideration. Lord Mansfield (who, after allowing every reasonable exception to some of his particular views, was, beyond all question, one of the most enlightened magistrates that ever adorned the English tribunals) observed in the famous case or Wyndham o. A. Chetwynd, 1 Burr. 430 —“ Every honest man should make that charge [for the payment of debts] in his will. He who omits it may be said to sin in hia grave.

I have already adverted to the disposition of -courts of equity to afford simple contract creditors the full benefit of a charge on lands, by the distinction established with respect to legal and equitable assets.

In the construction of wills the same inclination has been very strongly evinced. In Thomas v. Brittnell, 2 Ves. 313. Sir J. Strange, Master of the Rolls, speaking of a particular question of construction, said, that he bad no doubt but that the real estate would be subject to the payment of debts, not from any express mention made, that they should be a charge on the real estate, but from that construction the court makes for the benefit of creditors, and that men should not sin in their graves.

The same disposition was recognized and acted on by Lora Thurlow in Ridney r. Cous-maker, 1 Vesey, jun. 440, where he said—“ For subjecting land to debts very little is sufficient. The court has leaned that way, if we may be allowed to say so.* Lord Loughborough, on the rehearing of the same cause, 2 Vesey, jun. 268, said—“Thereis no reason, in my mind, to doubt that the court has put a construction upon this will, not only consistent with the principles of natural justice, but with the intention of the testator. I cannot impute to him the disposition his family imputes to him, to die, leaving an ample fortune, without taking care to provide for the payment of his debts: less words would enable the court to .say be intended the property to be taken as personal, especially for the pious purpose of paying his debts.

The inclination of the courts of equity in this respect was still more strongly marked in tke case of Kigktiey v. Kightley, 2 Ves. jun. 328, where the same words in the same sentence, “ First, I will and direct that all my debts, legacies, and funeral expences shall be

fully paid, ” applied without any distinction to debts and legacies, were held to constitute a charge for the debts and not for the legacies. The Master of the Rolls (Sir R. P. Arden; said, " The principle is perfectly different, the one being purely voluntary, the other obligatory. Whenever a man makes a will, he is supposed to do that which conscience obliges him to do; and if he shews an intention that his debts shall take place of every other disposition, and that he meant they should be paid, the court will strictly enforce that intention. The same principle will not apply to legacies.” And I apprehend that tills decision is admitted in the practice of courts of equity, as a clear and undoubted authority.

There are other important and well known instances, in which courts of equity have gone still farther in effectuating the same general purpose. By the law of the land, a copyhold estate cannot (or at least when this note was first written could not) pass by will, unless there is a previous surrender to uses; but where the intention is the payment of debts, and in some other favoured cases, the want of such surrender is supplied, and the heir is compelled to give effect to a disposition which, by the rules of law, is absolutely inoperative. So in case of supplying the defective execution of a power, an authority is given to charge or dispose of an estate in a certain mode, and with circumstances which are attached to the authority as conditions for its exercise; and as such, are by the person creating the authority, essentially incorporated with, and form a constituent part of, the authority itself. But when payment of debts is the purpose for which the authority is exercised, the conditions attached to the exercise of it are disregarded, and treated aa absolutely immaterial.

But the most striking instance of the interference of courts of equity upon this subject, is in cases where a party has a general power of appointment, of which, if it is unexecuted, the creditors can have no advantage; hut which, if actually executed in favour of other parties, the creditors are entitled to the benefit of in opposition to the actual objects of the appointment:so that an Act, without the voluntary exercise of which the creditors can have no claim upon the property in question, is laid hold of for their benefit, in direct contravention of the purpose and intention for which alone it has been performed.

It would he foreign from my present purpose to eaqpire whether the several doctrines above enumerated as prevailing by courts of equity, and which are matters of daily and familiar .occurrence, are consistent with the fair and proper limits of a purely judicial authority.

I think that, in later times, any attempts of an analogous nature would have been discouraged, as too much invading the province of legislation. The only reason for referring to them upon the present occasion, is the evidence which they furnish of the great importance that our tribunals must have attached to the end, when they have been induced to sanction such very strong and extraordinary means to effectuate it; clearly proving that the object, which so many unsuccessful efforts have been made to attain, has not only the support of theory and speculation, but the more favourite sanction of authority; and however questionable the original introduction of these peculiar doctrines or courts of equity may have been in principle, 1 am not aware that the effects of them, in point of experience, have been found to be prejudicial.

After so many instances of the interference of the legislature, and the disposition of the judicial tribunals to effectuate the purpose of subjecting the whole property of a debtor to the honest claims of his creditors, it might reasonably have been expected, that a direct proposal to accomplish so beneficial an object by the general operation of the law would have been received with considerable approbation. It would certainly have been difficult to anticipate that it would have had to encounter the opposition which it has in fact experienced.

As a motive for the proposed alteration of the law, strong instances have been cited, in which persons contracted debts to a large amount, for the purpose of acquiring property in land; and in order to secure the acquisition to their posterity, have terminated their lives by acts of suicide. But if only cases of this description, or others having any analogy to it, were to be guarded against, so rare a mischief might be permitted to remain without any material detriment to the community. From the attention which 1 have given to the matter under discussion, in adverting to the testamentary dispositions which have been the subject of judicial inquiry, as well as to those which have fallen under my own observation, during a long connection with the profession of ths law, I am satisfied that the instances in which a debtor purposely and deliberately sacrifices the interests of Ins creditors to the object of enriching his family arc very unfrequent indeed, and that the failure of justice to the creditors is almost invariably occasioned by mere delay and inattention; by a confidence in the adequacy of the funds which are legally applicable to the satisfaction of creditors; or by the want of technical skill in the persons by whom the instruments of testamentary disposition are prepared; and that, in adopting the proposed

alteration, the law would, in a mat majority of cases, accord with the wishes which the deceased owner of the property would really hare entertained.

It remains to consider the special reasons adduced for resisting an alteration of the law, the effect of which would apparently he to complete and perfect that system of substantial justice, which the several statutes and judicial determinations that have been alluded to have so manifest a tendency to promote.

Having already disposed of the mere common place invective upon the mischiefs of innovation, the first objection that occurs, and the one which is most insisted upon, is, “ That the creditors have no reason to complain, as they could not, according to the existing law, have computed upon having any claim on the real estates Of their debtors after their decease; that it is their own fault that they did not take care to procure securities of a higher nature; and that, “ Figilantibut, non darmientibus, jura mbveniuni."

Strongly as this objection has been urged, and much as it has been insisted upon, it does not appear to me to be of very considerable weight. In the ordinary transactions and business of society, it is necessary that persons should follow the ordinary course of proceeding; and the excessive precaution which would impede the business of life by minute and intricate calculations on the several processes of the law, or on the possibility of the death of a debtor before the discharge of his debt, upon his being insolvent in respect of personal assets, but entitled to adequate freehold property, which, by reason of his intestacy, or his omission to make a just provision for the payment of his debts, is not available, is a caution which would not be very beneficial to society, and would manifestly be detrimental to the individual.— Engagements are contracted with reference to the general expectation of their being performed, and the general legal powers of enforcing their performance. That it is meet and expedient that they should be performed, is an undisputed and self-evident proposition. That the legislature and courts of judicature have acted upon the principle of enforcing and facilitating their performance, is manifest from the sketch which has been traced of their proceedings. It is readily admitted that when, of two innocent persons, a loss and detriment must necessarily fall upon the one or the other, the advantage should he fairly given to him who has used the greatest degree of vigilance, by either taking a specific security, or an obligation of a higher nature; but when the question is entirely between a case of loss, detriment and prejudice on the one side, and a purely adventitious gain and benefit on the other, it is very difficult to discern an adequate reason for subjecting the

creditor, who has merely omitted to take an unusual and extraordinary, and, perhaps, an inconvenient precaution, to the penalty of forfeiting his just and equitable rights, for the mere purpose of enriching the heir or devisee of a deceased debtor, whose property would have been legally subjqpted to the discharge of his obligations, if his creditors had found "it necessary to have had recourse to legal proceedings against 1dm, dhd had brought them to a conclusion during his life. In short, there does not appear, in the maxim which has been quoted, any adequate reason to decline doing that justice by the general disposition of the law, which is so much encouraged and promoted as resulting from the particular dispositions of the individual, or for involving an honest creditor in loss and ruin, in order to constitute an opulent heir to an insolvent ancestor.

It has been further urged against the measure in question, that if the principles upon which the alteration of the law is proposed are admitted, they would equally extend to the cases of estates tail and copyholds; but certainly the extension of the measure to these would not }>e a necessary consequence of its application to freehold property. If it is wise and politic that these estates should continue to be exempt from liability to specialty debts, there certainly would be no apprehension of subjecting them to debts by simple contract.

I am not aware that any public inconvenience has arisen from these estates having been made subject to the operation of the bankrupt laws, of which there has now been an experience of nearly three centuries. I certainly think it would be a material improvement of the law, if copyhold estates were equally liable to the process of the law with estates of freehold; the substantial interests of the lord being effectually protected. Estates tail stand upon a particular footing; and I am not at present prepared to state that the extension of the law to them would upon the whole be a desirable measure.

If the matter were reduced to the dilemma, that either freehold estates in fee simple must be exempt from the general liability, or that entailed and copyhold estates must be subject to'it, I conceive that the great principles of utility would be more effectually promoted by the general comprehension of the whole to meet the purposes of justice, than by the general exemption of the whole in respect of the special favour which is claimed in respect of considerations applicable to the particular cases alluded to But certainly there Is no such dilemma in the case; and the geoMfi, as well as the particular liability, may be left to stand or fall, according to their own respective merits.

The great additional labour which would be. imposed on courts of equity is another objec tion to the proposed liability. I can by no means accede to the principle of this objection; for if the measure in question be in its own nature useful and expedient, the additional labour which may be imposed upon any particular tribunal is not an adequate reason for declining to adopt it; and if the number of judicial and ministerial appointments should be thought inadequate to the performance of the functions which the good of the community may require, an addition may be made, according to the nature and importance of the exigency. The recent appointment of an additional judge in the Court of Chancery appears to me to have been founded upon principles of peat expedience; and I am not competent to form a judgment of the particular regulations connected with that appointment. But, waving this discussion, and admitting the objection to be just in point of principle, I think it is unfounded in respect of probability, and that a direction so perfectly of course as the taking an account of real and personal assets, and specialty and simple contract debts, could not reasonably be expected to impose such an additional burden upon the judges of courts of equity, as should prevent the adoption of a measure, admitted in other respects to be salutary and beneficial.

The inquiry as to the existence or nonexistence of debts which are claimed as affecting property already liable, certainly forms no very great proportion of the business by which the judicial department of our courts of equity is at present occupied.

The only remaining objection which 1 am aware of is founded upon a regard to the trial by jury, and the inexpedience of. any measure which may give an accession of employment to tribunals in which that mode of inquiry does not prevail. Important and invaluable, however, as this course of proceeding unquestionably is, within its proper sphere and limits, it would be carrying our veneration for it much too far, to object to any other mode of investigation for the accomplishment of an object admitted to be beneficial in its nature, and for which such trial is confessedly inadequate.

The trial by jury, by some of its essential constituents, can only be applied to a conflict between two contending parties upon precise and definite points; and where the object of even such a contest is complicated and multifarious, the limited time Which can be devoted to it, renders it in general impossible to do

complete and adequate justice; and by a recommendation, having the force of a command, the matter is almost invariably referred to thedecision of a private tribunal. But to arrange the various interests of various contending parties, and to ascertain, apportion and administer the common fund in which they have an interest, is a purpose to which the functions of a jury are manifestly inapplicable and inadequate:and in case the relief in question is in itself proper and desirable, it would be a wanton sacrifice of the principal to the accessary, of the end to the means, to withhold the application of it, merely because, from its nature, it cannot be administered in the particular mode which, in other cases of a character perfectly dissimilar, is admitted to be peculiarly beneficial. —Before dismissing this part of the subject, it is a matter not to be overlooked, that, although the general course of relief must necessarily ne administered by means of a court of equity, any particular questions respecting the existence or non-existence of a disputed debt, upon which there is a fair and reasonable doubt, is, like all other controverted facts, referred to the proper tribunal of a jury; and that in a manner best calculated to produce a direct and immediate decision upon the very point in controversy, divested of all the adventitious and incidental matter, by which, In other cases, the proper object of tho inquiry is liable to be obstructed and embarrassed:and that no such prejudicial consequences are, in point of experience, found to result from the existing administration of the law 1q respect of debts charged upon real estates by will, as are justly calculated to excite a constitutional jealousy against imposing a similar charge by the general operation of the law.

The preceding observations were committed to writing recently after the rejection of the measure in question, in the session of 1815. The subject was again introduced to the notice of Parliament, in the following session, by the same gentleman who had already made so many unsuccessful efforts respecting it; upon which occasion he took a review of the objections noticed in the preceding observations, in many respects according with that which had occurred to myself. The proposal again succeeded in the Commons, and was again defeated in the Lords, but with so little discussion, that no observations respecting it have been, through the usual channels, commun^ cated to the public *

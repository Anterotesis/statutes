• of the Kinr’t Bench, and of the Bench at Westminster, from henceforth shall decide all pleas determinable at one day, before any matter be arraigned, or plea commenced the day following, saving that their essoigns shall be entered, judged, and allowed; yet, by

• reason hereof, let none presume to absent himself at the day to him limited.

[No. 111.] 6 Edward I. (Gloucester) c. 8.—No Suit for Goods in the King’s Courts under forty shillings. Attorneys may be made where an Appeal lieth not. The Defendant being essoigned shall bring in his Warrant.

6 Edward L 1T is provided also. That sheriffs shall plead Pleas of Trespass m c. 8. 4 A their counties, as they have been accustomed to be pleaded. And

that none from henceforth shall have writs of trespass before Justices,

* unless he swear by his faith that the goods taken away were worth

* forty shillings (I) at the least. And if he complain of beating, he shall answer by nis faith, that his plaint is true. Touching wounds and maims, a roan shall have his writ as before hath been used; and it is agreed that the defendants in such pleas may make their attornies, 4 where appeal lieth not; so that if they be attainted, being absent, then the sheriff shall be commanded to take them, and shall nave like pain as they should have had, if they had been present at the judgment given. And if the plaintiffs from henceforth in such trespasses cause themselves to be essoigned after the first appearance, day shall be given them wnto the coming of the Justices m Eyre, and the defendants in the mean time shall be in peace. In such pleas and other, whereas attachments and distresses do lie, if the defendant cssoigu himself of the King's service, and do oot bring his warrant at the day given him

* by the cssoign, he shall recompense the plaintiff damages for his Journey twenty shillings, or moce* after the discretion of the Justices, 4 and shall be grievously amerced unto the King.

(1) If it appear to a superior Court that the debt sued tor is under forty shillings, they wifi, on motion, stay the proceedings before trial; Kennard v. Jones, 4 T. R. 495; and proceedings were accordingly stayed, it being sworn by the defendant, and not denied by the plaintiff, that the debt was under forty shillings:Wellington v. Alters, 5 T. R. 64. But no action can be brought in the county, or other inferior court, unless the cause of action arise, and the defendant reside (or at least is served with process) within the jurisdiction of such court; and if that be not the case, or if for •other cause the plaintiff cannot sue in an infer rior court, he may sue in a superior court for a debt under forty shillings:Welsh v. Troytc, 2 H. B. 29. TubVt. Woodward, 6 T. R. 175. Smith v. 0‘Kelly, 1 B. & P. 75. Busby v. Fcaron, 8 T. R. 235.

It is obvious that at the time when the distinction was made, as to the amount of the demand for which Jurisdiction was given to tbs county add other inferior, courts, such amount was of very considerable relative importance, and that by the change which has since taken place it has become absolutely insignificant; so that in the majority of the cases that are brought before the superior courts, the original object in dispute is a matter of very small importance nr comparison to the expense of litigation; and, consequently, the dread and apprehension of such expense is equivalent to a failure of justice. The inconvenicneo of this state of things has been long felt and acknowledged, and different proposals have^been made for removing it. As the attention of the Editor has been very particularly directed to this subject* an article is intended to be devoted to it in the Appendix.—(omitted in this edition.)

4 and Attaints shall be taken, and they shall associate unto them one or two of the discreetest knights of the shire into which they shall come;

4 and shall take the foresaid Assises and Attaints but thrice in the year 1 at the most, that is to say, first between the Quinzime of Saint John Baptist, and the Guic of August; and the second time between the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, and the Utas of Saint Mi-4 chad; and the third time, between the Feast of the Epspkang, and the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Jdarp. And in every shire,

4 at every taking of Assises before their departure, they shall appoint the day of their return, so that every one of the shire may know of their coming, and shall adjourn the Assises from Term to Terra, if the taking of them be deferred at any day by vouching to warranty,

4 by esaoign, or by default of jurors. Ana if they see that it be profitable for any cause that Assises of Mortdauncestor, being respited by essoign or voucher, ought to be adjourned into the Bench, it shall be lawful for them to do it, and then they shall send the record with the original writ before the Justices of the Bench; and when the matter is come to the taking of the Assise, the Justices of the Bench shall remit the matter to the former Justices before whom the Assise shall be taken. But from henceforth the Justices of the Bench in such Assises shall gi ve four days at the least in the year before the said Justices ns- signed, for to spare expense and labour. Inquisitions of trespass shall be determined before the Justices of both Benches, except the trespass be so heinous that it shall require great examination. Inquisitions also of other pleas pleaded in either of the Benches, shall be determined before them, wherein small examination is required, as when the entry or seisin of any is denied, or in case when one article is to be inquired. But inquisitions of many and great articles, the which require great examination, shall be taken before the Justices of the Bench, except that both parties desire that the inquisition may be taken afore some of the associates when they do come into those parts;

4 so that from henceforth it shall not be done but by two Justices, or one with some knight of the shire, upon whom the parties can agree.

4 And such inquisition shall not be determined by any Justices of the Bench, unless a day and a place certain be appointed in the shire, in presence of the parties, and the day and place shall be mentioned in a 4 writ judicial by these words—Prsecipiruus tibi quod venire facias coram justiciaries nostris apud Westmonasterium in octabis sancti Mi-chaelis, nisi tali* et talk tali die et loco ad partes illas venerint, duo-decira, Ac.c.

II. And when such inquests be taken, they shall be returned into the Bench, and there shall judgment be given, and there they shall be inrolled. And if any inquisitions be taken otherwise than after this form, they shall he of no effect, except that an Assise of Darrein pre- scuSmeniy and inquisitions of Qusre impedii shall be determined in their own shire, before one Justice of the Bench and one Knight, at a 4 day and place certain in the Bench assigned, whether the defendant consent or not, and there the judgment shall be given immediately. 1 All Justices of the Benches from henceforth shall have in their circuits clerks to inroll all pleas pleaded before them, like as they have used to have in time passed. And also it is ordained. That the Justices assigned to take Assises shall not compel the jurors to say precisely whe-4 (her it be disseisin or not, so that they do shew the truth of the deed, 4 and require aid of the Justices. But if they of their own head will saj that it is disseisin, their verdict shall be admitted at their own peril. And from henceforth the Justices shall not pnt in Assises or juries any other than those that were summoned to the same at the first1

it to have been left; Brookes v. Mason, tp. The Reporter states in a note, that no proof that the defendant desired to take it back again; but what is stated certainly seem to amount to that. The so far as appears, took no notice of the "ve expression of the Act; and in v. Shee, 1 Camp. N. P. 437, it was that notwithstanding the attorney shewed r client a copy of the bill, and explained the Merges, in which the client acquiesced, the attorney was bound to leave a copy of the bill.

I Where several are jointly liable, a delivery to UK by whose instructions the business was done is sufficient; see Finchctt v. How, 2 Camp. W. P. 277.

(1) Leaving at the counting-house is not sufficient. Hill ». Humphreys, 2 B. & P. 343.

(2) If there is a duplicate of the bill, it may be given in evidence without notice to produce the part'delivered: but there not being such duptocate, evidence from entries in the plaintiff ’i books is not admissible without such notice.

(3) The Court of Common Pleas held delivery of an attorney’s bill to be conclusive evidence, on the taxation of costs, against an increase of charge in a subsequent bill, on any of the item* contained in it; and strong presumptive evidence against any additional items. Loveridge v. Botham, 1 B. & P. 49.

(4) See 12 Geo. 2. c. 13. post. § 5.

(5) If a bill contain any one item subject to

Voi*. 111.

taxation, it is settled by several cases that the whole must be taxed; Winter v. Payne, 6 T. R. 645:Hill v. Humphreys, 2 B. & P. 343; Mowbray v, Fleming, 11 East. 285:and Lord Eldon in Hill v. Humphreys, said “ I do not enter into the question, whether if any item, not connected with the profession of an attorney, had been included, the plaintiff would have been precluded from recovering upon them. Perhaps, however, we should not feel great difficulty in holding, that an attorney who inserts his whole demand upon his client in a bill containing taxable items, shall be taken to agree that he "will not bring an action upon any part of such demands, until the bill had been delivered a month; but if an attorney have a demand for taxable business, and also for conveyancing, and deliver no bill, it seems he may recover for the conveyancing; see Hill v. Humphreys; Miller v. Towers, Peake N. P. 102. There being no other bill delivered than the particulars under a rule of Court, It was ruled in Mowbray v. Fleming (11E. 285) that an item for money paid, unconnected with the business of an attorney, might be recovered; see Benton v. Guricas, 3 Esp. N. P. Cas. 149.

The items of the bill cannot be examined at Nisi Prius; Williams v. Frith, Doug. 197; Hooper »>. Tell, Doug. 198:but the bill may be taxed after action brought, and at any time" before the verdict or judgment, unless the money has been paid into court; Shaw ». Pickering, Doug. 198, (n).

What shall be accounted issues.

The sheriff returneth that there was disturbance of execution of process.

also sheriffs make false returns as touching these articles* Quod de exilibut, Sfc. returning sometime and lying, that there be no issues, 4 sometime that there are small issues, when they may return jgreat, and sometimes do make mention of no issues; wherefore it is ordained and agreed. That if the plaintiff demand hearing of the sheriff's return, it shall be granted him; ^and if he offer to aver that the sheriff might have returned greater issues unto the King, he shall have a writ judicial unto the justices assigned to take assizes, that they shall inquire in presence of the sheriff (if he will be there) of what and how great issues the sheriff might have made return from the day of the writ purchased unto the aay contained in the writ. And when the inquest is returned, if he have not afore answered for the whole, he shall be charged with the overplus by the extreats of the justices delivered in the Exchequer, and nevertheless shall be grievously amerced for the concealment. And let the sheriff know that rents, corn in the grange, 4 and all moveables (except horse, harness, and household-stuff) be contained within the name of Issues. And the King hath commanded that the sheriffs shall be punished by the justices once or twice (if need 4 be) for such false returns; and if they offend the third time, none shall have to do therewith but the King. They make also many times false answers, returning that they could not execute the King's precept for the resistance of some great man; wherefore let the sheriffs beware from henceforth, for such manner of answers redound much to the dishonour of the King. And as soon as his bailiffs do testifie that they found such resistance, forthwith all things set apart (taking with him the power of the shire) he shall go in proper person to do execution; and if he find bis under-bailiffs false, he shall punish them by imprisonment, so that other by their example may be reformed; and if he do find them true, he shall punish the resisters by imprisonment,

4 from whence they shall not be delivered without the King's special commandment. And if percase the sheriff when he cometh do find resistance,

4 he shall certifie to the court the uames of the resisters, aiders, consenters,

4 commanders, and favourers, and by a writ judicial they shall be attached by their bodies to appear at the King's court: And if they be convict of such resistance, they shall be punished at the King's pleasure.

4 Neither shall any officer of the King's meddle in assigning the punishment, for our Lord the King hath reserved it specially to himself, because that resistors have been reputed disturbers of nis peace, and of his realm. '

•This act, which relates to the general administration of justice, has certainly all the marks and characters which can distinguish a public act; notwithstanding which, it was, in several cases, regarded as a private one, and as such was regularly considered in practice for a long space of time: but to the scries of authorities in support of this doctrine, there was one exception in the case of Mills r. Bond, 1 Str. 399; and upon the general question coming before the Court of King's Bench, in Samuel v. Evans, 2T. R. 549, it was ruled upon the authority of the before mentioned case to be a public act.—Mr. J. Ashurst, in giving his opinion upon that occasion, said,

“ If all the cases on this subject were on one side, however apparently contrary to reason they might be, the court would be bound by them: but'if there are several cases which are not reconcileable to reason on one side, and one sensible case to the contrary, we ought to decide according to the latter. Now, there can be no doubt on the reason of the thing, hut that this is a general law; and the ease in Strange corroborating the opinion that it is so,

we might determine it to be such, independent of the authority of another act, which unquestionably makes it a general law."

In a former publication 1 availed myself of the opportunity of this passage, to express my sentiments respecting the general propriety of correcting erroneous precedents; and as the subject is of great importance, I shall take the liberty of inserting the observations which then occurred to me.

1 have always regarded this sentiment as stopping short of the true principle, by which the exertion of judicial authority ought to be regulated: and if a court possesses the aatbo-rity of correcting an established doctrine, sap* ported by several cases which are not reconcileable to reason, because there is one sensible precedent to the contrary, 1 cannot see any material obstacle to their setting the example of that sensible precedent themselves. The authority of the court is the same today as yesterday; in the 44th of Oeo.

(2) If the defendant tender a bail-bond, with sufficient sureties, and the sheriff refuse to accept it, he is liable to a special action in the case: but not to an action of trespass, for the refusal does not make him a trespasser ab initio. See authorities cited Williams’s Note, 2 Saund. 31. c. (5.); and the action docs not lie against the bailiff who refuses, but it must be against the sheriff, 2 Mod. 32, Smith v. Hall.

(3) In Rex 4.

4 ing any particular or certain cause of action, and thereupon kept prisoners for a long time for want of bail, bonds with sureties for apoear- ances having been demanded in so great sums that few or none have dared to be security for the appearances of such persons so arrested and imprisoned, although in truth there hath been little or no cause of action; and oftentimes there are no such persons who are named plnia- tiffs, but those arrests have been many times procured by malicious persons to vex and oppress the defendants, or to force from them unreasonable and unjust compositions for obtaining their liberty; and by such evil practices many men have been, and are daily unaone, and destroyed in their estates, without possibility of haying reparation, the* 4 actors employed in such practices having been (for the most part) poor and lurking persons, and their actings so secret, that it hath bees found very difficult to make true discoveries or proof thereof: *

II. For remedy and prevention of which so great growing evils and mischiefs, and also for discouraging all frivolous and unjust suits, and causeless arrests for the future; be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled* and by the authority of the same, That from and after the twelfth: day of February, in the year of our Lord One thousand six hundred aixty and one, no person or persons.who shall happen to be arrested by any sheriff under-sheriff, coroner, steward, or bailiff of any franchise or liberty, or by any other officer, minister, under-bailiff, or other person or persons whatsoever, within this realm, having or pretending to have authority or warrant iu that behalf, by force or colour of any writ, bill, or process issuing or to be issuing out of H19 Majesty's said courts of the King's Bench and Common Pleas, or either of them, in which said writ, bill or process, the certainty and true cause of action is not expressed particularly, (1) and for which the defendant or defendants in such writ, hill or process named, is and are bailable by the statute in that behalf made in the three and twentieth year of the reign of the late King Henry the Sixth, shall be forced or compelled to give security, or to enter into bond with sureties, for the appearances of such person or persons so arrested, at the day and place in the said writ, bill or process specified or contained, in any penalty or sum or sums of money, .exceeding the sum

* See Williams's Note, 2 Saund. 52.

(1) This statute (without any such intention in the makers) had liked to have ousted the King's Bench of all its jurisdiction over civil injuries without force; for as the bill of Middlesex was framed only for actions of trespass,

a defendant could not be arrested and held to bail thereupon for breaches of civil contracts But to remedy this inconvenience, the oflews of the King’s Bench devised a method of adding what is called a clause of ae etimm to the usual complaint of trespass; 3BkComm. 3B7CM III.] Original Writ—Proc*n~Arrest>

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, friat upon appearance to be entered in the term wherein such writ, bill or process is rrturnmble, with the respective officer in that behalf, for the said person or persons, by attorney or attornies in the said respective courts from whence the said writ, bill or process issued, unto such writ, bill or process, the bond or bonds so given for appearance thereunto, be and are hereby satisfied and discharged; and that after soch appearance so entered, no amerciaments be set or estreated upon or against any sheriff or other officer aforesaid, or any other person whatsoever, concerning the want of such appearance $ and unless the plaintiff or plaintiffs in any mch writ, bill or process named, shall put into the court from whence toeh writ, bill or process did issue, his or their bill or declaration against the person or persons so arrested, in some personal action, or tjeetione firm* of lands or tenements, before the end of the term next following after appearance, that then a nonsuit for want of a declaration may be entered against the said plaintiff or plaintiffs in the said courts respecta; and that every defendant in every such writ, bill or process named, or may have judgment to recover costs against every such plaintiff or pluntiffs, to be assessed, taxed and levied in such manner, and according as it is provided by the statute for costs, made in the three and twentieth year of the reign of the late King Henry the Eighth; any fortner or other act, statute, ordinance, law, custom, order, course or usage of either of the said courts, to the contrary thereof heretofore had, made, admitted or used, in any wise not withstanding.

VI. And whereas very many suits commenced by original writs have 1 been protracted and long delayed from judgment ana execution, by (reason of the necessity of having fifteen days at the least between the days of the te»te and the days of return of writs now used in personal c actions, and also in action ejectione firmce, for lands and tenements:* for remedy thereof, and for the more easy expediting trials, and the better and more speedy executing of judgments for the time to come, be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, Thai in all actions of debt, and all other personal actions whatsoever, and also in all actions of ejectione firm<*?, for lands and tenements now depending, or which at any time hereafter shall be depending, by original writ, in either of His Majesty’s courts aforesaid, after any issue therein joined to be tried by a jury, and also after any judgment had or obtained, or to be had or obtained in either of the courts aforesaid, in any such action as aforesaid, there shall not need to be fifteen days between the teste day and the day of return of .any writ or writs of venire facias, habeas corpora juratorum, or distringas jur stores, writ of fieri facias, or writs of capias ad satisfaciendum: And that the want of fifteen days between the teste day and the day of return of any such writ, shall not be, nor shall be assigned, taken or adjudged to be, any matter or cause of error; any law, custom, statute, course or usage to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

VII. Provided nevertheless, That this Act, nor any thing therein contained, shall not extend or be construed to extend to any writ of capias ad satisfaciendum whereon a writ of exigent after judgment is to be awarded, nor to capias ad satisfaciendum against the defendant in order to make any bail liable, but that the same continue and be as if this Act had never been made.

(1) It Was held in Heathfield v. Chilton, 4 Bur. 2015, to be insufficient to claim a discharge of a defendant, as being servant to the Minister of the Prince, Bishop of Liege; that It was necessary to learn in what manner the minister was accredited.—44 Certainly, ” said Lord Mansfield, 44 he was not ambassador, which is the first rank. Envoy indeed is a second class; but he is not shewn to be even an envoy: he was called minister, it is true, but minister alone is an equivocal term/*— The case went off upon a collateral point. Lord Mansfield in that case arid, that the law of nations does not take in consuls or agents of commerce, although received as such by the courts at which they are employed; and this point was expressly determined in an elaborate

judgment in the very recent case of Viveash v Becker, 3 M. & . 284.

(2) The servant need not lie in the house, although he must do some service there; Evans v. Higgs, 2 Str. 797; Widmore 11. Alvarez, cited ibid. Many cases arose upon claims of privilege, by persons as servants of the Count Haslang, the Bavarian Ambassador, of whom it was said, that although a minister of a very humble rank, he had more domestics registered than the ambassadors of the most potent powers in Europe.—In the first case that occurs. Masters v. Manby, 1 Bur. 401, application Was made to discharge the defendant, as being his messenger, and it was sworn that he sometimes executed service as such.

Bath, 3 Bur. 1478, the privilege was allowed to the defendant, as English Secretary of the count; the defendants affidavits being so framed, that every thing was sworn that in absolute strictness could be required, to bring him within the description of a domestic servant; and the court held that it was sufficient if an actual bona fide service were proved, and that if such a service were proved, they must not, upon bare suspicion, suppose it to have been merely colourable and collusive.—In Lockwood v. Coys-garne, 3 Bur. 1676, the claim of privilege was disallowed to the defendant as the count's physician, aa not being a case of bona fide service, mod the court said, it would be of ▼ery bad consequence if protections should be

set up for sale, or made use of merely for the sake of screening people from their just debts. In Darling e.

(1) As to the sufficiency of an affidavit to hold to bail, see Tidd's Practice, c. 8. It is an established rule, that in the King's Bench no sapplementary or explanatory affidavit can be received on the part of the plaintiff, nor any counter or contradictory one on the part of the defendant. The practice is otherwise in the Common Pleas; as to supplemental affidavits, see Gttnham ».Hammond, 2 B.A P. 298, and the cases there cited:and there arc dicta as to its being otherwise with respect to affidavits in contradiction; but I apprehend that such a practice is allowed, if at all, very sparingly, and there are not any recent traces of it in the Reports.

With respect to the general question, of the justice and propriety of admitting counter affidavits upon the subject, (for which the interposition of the legislature would be required)

1 have long entertained a very strong opinion in favour of such a measure, and am satisfied that great in justice and oppression are exercised by means of the opportunity which a plaintiff baa of depriving a person of ilia liberty, by an iff davit m common form, to which no contradiction can be received. The small degree of tcrnple which is often manifested in mis, as veil as many other casesj with respect to making affidavits in a common form, affords matter for the most serious reflection. There is a common cant maxim, that the courts cannot try the cause upon affidavits; which, like many other cant maxims, has an imposing sound with very little meaning; as the exercise of the judgment of the court, with respect to the measure of extra precaution, can have no legitimate influence upon the verdict vhich may be afterwards given upon evidence of the facts; and the admitting, with due discretion and moderation, an affidavit on the behalf of the defendant, which might put the plaintiff upon stating, specifically, such facts as would shew the existence of a legal debt by an affidavit, upon which perjury can be distinctly assigned, would be a considerable check upon that random kind of swearing, by which any person who sets up a demand against another, however disputable, with respect cither t& the facts or the law, is made in the first instance, and bo far as relates to the question of aiTest, the absoluteand conclusive judgeof his own case, in a point which may occasion detriment or ruin to the defendant, and has certainly very often the effect of obtaining payment of a demand contrary to the real truth and justice of the case.

It is agreed that the restriction of this Act does not extend to writs upon which bail ia directed to be taken by special order of a judge.

Although the statute prevents a person being held to ball in a penal action of debt, there is no such restriction upon a proceeding by information in the Crown Office, where a process of Attachment issues. Mr. Chitty, in his Treatise on the Game Laws, mentions this as a circumstance which renders the proceeding by information peculiarly desirable, when the offender is likely to abscond:but however desirable it may be for the objects of a prosecution on the Game Laws, . Dak very far from thinking, that to allow- o£

such a practice, and the difiriftjig a party of his liberty for such an alleged Sflfence, is desirable as affecting the real purposes of justice.

For penalties in the Exohequer, a person is arrested upon a process which merely gives him information, in technical language, of the legal offence which he ia supposed to have incurred, without having any access to the affidavit upon which the process issues, or any information of the particular manner In which he is charged with having offended, until the case is actually brought to trial; and although no suspicion can be entertained of improper intentions on the part of the officers having the conduct of such proceedings, there may be great room for sinister proceedings In those who may have an interest in communicating to them false information; and the more completely destitute of foundation the accusation may be, the greater difficulty will arise in preparing to meet it. In fact, the being prepared to meet the specific case which is offered at the trial, is not unfrequentiy urged in argument as shewing a consciousness of its truth. In the course of my own practice, I was lately consulted on behalf of a person imprisoned on a charge of an offence against the revenue, of the ground and foundation of wliiph he assert106

Recital of 12 Geo. L c. 29.

1 Ti/IEREAS in an Act made in the twelfth year of the reign of his T late Majesty King George the First, intituled, 44 An Act to pre* vent frivolous and vexatious arrests, ” it is amongst other things

* enacted, That from and after the twenty-fourth day of Jume, which was in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twentysix, no person should he held to special bail upon any process issuing oat of any superior court, where the effuse of action should not amount to the sum of ten pounds or upwards, nor ont of any inferior court, where the cause of action should not amount to the sum of

* forty shillings or upwards; and that in all cases where the cause of action should not amount to the sum of ten pounds or upwards in any such superior court, or to forty shillings or upwards in any such inferior court (and the plaintiff or plaintiffs should proceed by the way of process against the person) he, she, or they should not arrest or cause to be arrested the body of the defendant or defendants, but should serve him, her, or them personally, within the jurisdiction of the court, with a copy of the process; and if such defendant or defendants should not appear at the return of the process, or within four days after such return, in such case it should and might be lawful to

ed his entire ignorance. I had no means of forming an opinion of the veracity of the particular statement, and a verdict passed against the party for the penalty claimed; but I was fully satisfied of the probable effect of the existing practice being such as I have represented, and surely there ought to be very strong motives of public utility to support a general system, which is manifestly capable of admitting so great an abuse:and although, on the one hand, it may be admitted to be an important object to prevent the escape of a guilty person from the claims of justice, it is no less important to guard against the admission of a course of procedure, which may have the effect of unjustly depriving those of their liberty, who, with any reasonable degree of probability, may assert their innocence; and the loss and inconvenience which naturally attend a departure from the kingdom, with a relinquishment of all existing connections and pursuits. Is in itself no small security 4or the party being finally amenable to the exigencies of the law, sadis therefore a sufficient reason, uot only for nsing the greatest degree of precaution in individuals, but for affording a greater protection by the law against a previous imprisonment, upon a charge resting upon information, which is not disclosed, and which a person unjustly accused has no means to oppose.

The admitting counter affidavits on the part of defendants, would, I am aware, give a considerable accession of trouble to the judges of the superior courts; but in this, and many other respects, alterations in the law are highly requisite, for the purpose of affording some relief from the great pressure of an accumulated weight of business :—a subject which I shall elsewhere take an opportunity of adverting to more particularly.

I do not think it necessary to refer more particularly to the statutes which require affidavits to hold bail to negative a tender in bank notes, and which are only continued as a temporary measure.

By the law of Scotland no person can be, arrested previous to a judgment against him, except upon a warrant from a judge, issued upon an affidavit of the creditor, that he believes his debtor to be in Meditation Fuge; and the creditor is subject to damages should the circumstances not afford sufficient ground for the application.

action did not amount to 15/., or to any sum for which defendant was liable to be arrested was held bad on general demurrer for not shewing the writ to be a special writ. Ball v. Swan, 1 Barn. & Aid. 393.

Whether the Act extends to replevin ? vide Topping v. Pure, 5 Taunt. 771.

(2) In Moore ». Taylor, 5 Taunt. 71, the Court of Common Pleas were clear that this Act did not extend to Counties Palatine, and threw out doubts that it did not even extend to the Court of Exchequer; but by a note of the reporter it appears, that that court has adopted the opposite construction.—I cannot discover on what ground the construction of the Act, as having a limited operation, is founded, the words being perfectly general; and, from my own observation and experience, l am satisfied that there is no subject to which the provirions of the Act could be applied with more beneficial effect, than the execution of process upon writs of justicies in counties palatine^—Where a defendant is abroad, a plaintiff may still (since the 51 Geo. IIL c. 124.) issue a distringas on service of the venire facias for the purpose of compelling hi* appearance thereby, as he might have done before that Act; but not for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff to enter an appearance for him, so that he may proceed thereon to final judgment, as if the defendant himself had appeared; Nicholson .v. Bownass, 3 Price, 253. . P. Dwerryhouse v. Graham, 3 Price, 263.

(3) This provision does not apply to a case where the defendant has been actually served; as In that case the plaintiff may proceed and enter an appearance; Anon. 1 'Marshall, 268 (o). The affidavit for obtaining a distringas

must state a belief, that the defendant has absconded, with the grounds of such belief; Down v. Crewe, 1 Marshall, 267; and leave to issue a distringas will not be granted upon affidavit that the defendant was out of the kingdom, and therefore could not be served with process; Jordan v. Bell, 1 Marshall, 292.

The statute 43 George III. c. 53, which applies to Ireland the general provisions of stat. 12 Geo. I. c. 29. supra, provides, that wherever it appears to the Court out of which process issues that all due diligence has been used to have the process of the Court personally served, yet, that under the special circumstances of the case appearing to the Court by affidavit that it was impossible to procure personal service, it should be lawful for the Court to substitute such other kind of service as to them should seem fit. 2 Gabbett, 200.

As the period of the continuance of the present Act is so very short, the subject of it must of coarse be brought under the consideration of the legislature; and, 1 apprehend, that Such a general provision as has been last noticed would be very desirable; that it should be extended to all superior Courts, and the case where process could not be served on account of the defendant being abroad, should be expressly included. It might be fairly Confided to the justice of the courts to adopt such regulations as would prevent defendants from being injured by a proceeding of which they had not a sufficient opportunity of being apprised.

Cm 102. 1813.*]

WHERE AS, notwithstanding the occasional Acts which have from time to time passed for the relief of insolvent debtors, and the

* discharge of many prisoners for small debts by charitable donations.

• Few statutes which have passed in modern times have produced so general and extensive a change in the system of the law as the present. The effect of it has been much complained of by the mercantile classes of society; and although the duration of the measure is but temporary, and without an express renewal it will expire in three years, it is probable that it may not be allowed even that limited duration, and that before this collection is offered to the public, the law may have been restored to its ancient course.

It is, however, observable, that many of those whose opinions are most directly opposite upon other matters of legislation, and who mutually impute to each other a spirit of wanton innovation, or of unreasonable tenacity of ancient usages, have concurred in supporting this measure, as being essentially conducive to the interests of humanity.

That true policy and true humanity must necessarily coincide in every judicial establishment, is an opinion admitted by all who have directed their attention to general enquiries respecting legal polity; and it is evident that they must be united in that system which, in the full measure of its results, is attended with the greatest portion of practical utility: but it is in many cases impossible to adopt a system which is beneficial with reference to the whole sphere of its operation, but free from great and serious objections in many instances of its immediate application:and such must evidently be the case, with respect to the adoption or rejection of the law of imprisonment for debt, or to any modification or extension of that system which may render it nugatory by excess of lenity, or oppressive by excess of ngour.

To confide to a disappointed creditor the right of incarcerating for a considerable* length of time an unfortunate debtor, who has entered into his engagements with a foil prospect and intention of performing them, and has used every exertion in his power to do so, must, when considered alone, excite a sentiment of reproach towards the law which is open to such an imputation:but to establish a system which will prevent the Contracting engagements, the performance whereof depends upon the hazards of speculation, and excite a due exertion for the discharge of obligations that would otherwise be disregarded, is essential to the maintenance of civil society; and it probably will be found, upon examination, that the advantage can only be effectually obtained at the price of the inconvenience; and that a minute and accurate distinction between the respective cases,

founded upon just and equitable principles, is beyond the reach of judicial enquiry. The true object of legislation on the subject is, therefore, to adopt that system which will be attended with the smallest degree of detriment and inconvenience upon the whole; and it must never be overlooked, that the misery occasioned by the non-performance of engagements may be In its nature equally great and severe with that of the coercion which is permitted as the alternative. Supposing the disadvantages on the one side and the other to be nearly balanced, I am ready to admit, that the choice should be against the adoption of a system which would subject to a length of imprisonment a party willing to apply all his apparent resources in satisfaction of his engagements: but 1 conceive the real balance of general advantage to be considerably on the opposite side. In this instance, as in the general operation of penal law, the evil which arises is direct and obvious: the great and essential benefit arises from the silent and unperceived operation of the law, in inducing a compliance with its precepts, from an apprehension of the consequences resulting from their infraction: and without calling in aid of the argument the sentiment of humanity, the inducements to form rash and fraudulent engagements, or to recede from the performance of engagements attended with detriment and inconvenience, are much stronger, and operate to an infinitely greater extent, than those which, in the mere indulgence of a feeling of disappointment and revenge, would lead to the incurring a considerable expense for the purpose of inflicting unmerited misery upon real misfortune. The testimony which has been repeatedly given by those holding the highest stations in the law, that upon the agitation of bills of insolvency, they have received innumerable applications from fraudulent debtors, compared with the number of those from harsh and rigorous creditors, affords a strong confirmation of the reasoning, that the coercion which results from an apprehension of imprisonment is much more extensively an instrument of justice than an engine of oppression.

The delay, the expense, and the uncertainty of ultimate satisfaction, are strong considerations With a prudent creditor, to accept from his debtor such satisfaction as is within the reach of his ability; while the terror of that delay and expense, the threats of exhausting the means of present satisfaction, and of rendering any adverse proceedings nugatory and unavailing to the purposes of satisfaction— afford to the fraudulent debtor the ready means of defiance and offence; and with reference to

Class DL] Original Wnt~Prece$9-~Arrest, Sfc.

4 mat numbers of persons generally remain confined for debt in dif- terent prisons in England ? and it is therefore expedient to make a permanent provision for the relief of insolvent debtors in England, 4 under certain restrictions»’ Be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same. That, from and after the passing of this

14 *

No. XLIL 53 Geo. Ill* c. 103. '

the Act at present under consideration, it is said to be a common taunt from a debtor to his creditor, to offer him a bill at three months upon the Noble Lord with whom it origiThc great increase of imprisonment which usually takes place upon the expectation of occasional acts of bankruptcy, and which has existed during the operation of the present Act, must manifestly arise from the contrivance of the debtors themselves; as the expectation of relief by the creditors under such circumstances will of course be weaker than under the common operation of the pre-existing law; and with respect therefore to all the additional numbers, the law becomes—not, as it should be, a shield from oppression, but a weapon of offence.

Without alluding to the impression of the general body of commercial persons, as to the Impolicy of the subsisting law, I believe it may be stated as an unquestionable fact, that, al»h the number of imprisonments has y increased, the number of suits for the recovery of debts has diminished in an almost incredible degree. Ike diminution of legal proceedings will by many be considered as no unfavourable symptom of the advantage at the law by which it is occasioned; but there is all the difference of excellence and defect between a law which has the effect of diminishing litigation by rendering it unnecessary, and producing without effort those advantages which it is the object of litigation to obtain, and alaw which occasions the relinquishment of proceedings before resorted to in the expectation of justice and redress, from a conviction, not merely of their inutility and ineflicacy, but of their producing an augmentation of the loss which they are intended to avert.

1 do not dwell upon the regulations contained in this and other Acts of insolvency, for the benefit of the creditor, with respect to either present or future property. It is perfectly notorious that the practical benefit arising from these regulations is very limited indeed. At the time of my writing, an inquiry is directed in Parliament to bring the question to a test; bat I have a strong impression that the satisfaction which is so obtained will amount to less than a farthing in the pound upon the aggregate of the debts from which, by the operation of the Acts, there is a personal discharge. (The result of the enquiry-has not appeared at the time of committing this sheet to the press; but according to statements wMeh have been made in Parliament, my computation is above fourfold more favourable than the truth.]

Unfavourable, however, as my impression! are of the consequences resulting from the system which has been established, 1 am not an advocate for its sadden relinquishment. 1 am inclined to think that the permitting its existence until the period already fixed for its expiration, will have* the effect of affording a fair and reasonable trial of its real character; and perhaps the objections which have been referred to may be then obviated by an extension of the term -of imprisonment; and a system which is injurious by restricting the imprisonment to three months, may probably be rendered beneficial by extending that period to a year; a measure, the adoption of which for such a length of time as would afford an adequate opportunity to judge of its effects, would-, I conceive, be preferable to an immediate and total relinquishment of the system in the first instance.

Before concluding this note 1 will add, that, although unfriendly to the measure which has occasioned it, 1 should feel much pleasure from a regulation which would enable a debtor, by the assent of a considerable portion of his creditors, to place his effects under proper management for their benefit, without the necessity of a previous imprisonment, or the difficulties and embarrassments which attend the present system of the bankrupt law; a subject on which I have already stated my sentiments to the public; and which I shall probably have again occasion to advert to in the course of the present Volume.

I also think it not wholly unimportant to express a doubt of the propriety of introducing exceptions in acts of insolvency; with regard to damages recovered in particular kinds of actions; as such an exception rather tends to confound the proper‘limits between criminal and civil proceedings, and imposes, in an indirect course of punishment, an imprisonment of much greater duration than is usual in cases of the direct and immediate application of the criminal law.

I conceive that a provision against any defendant being liberated in respect of the costs of a cause which has been brought to trial, unless the judge before whom the canse was tried should certify that there was a reasonable ground of defence, would be a very material relief to creditors; and that it would be eligible to give the court to which the application was made, a discretion to withhold the discharge in respect of costs upon cases not brought to trial, when there appeared to have been any sham pleading or writ of error for delay, or any other proceeding whereby the expense of the plaintiff had been unnecessarily increased.

* should meet, or the same be re-assembled i and from and immediately

* after aa adjournment of both Houses of Parliament for above the

* space of fourteen days, until both Houses should meet or assemble; 1 are insufficient to obviate the inoonveniences arising from the delay of suits by reasoh of privilege of parliament; whereby the parties often

* lose the benefit of several terms; for the preventing all delays the King

* or his subjects may receive ia prosecuting their several rights, titles,

* debts, dues* demands, or suits, for which they have cause; ' Be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of thesame, That from and after the twenty-fourth day of June, One thousand seven hundred and seventy, any person or persons shall and may, at any time, commence and prosecute any action or suit in any court of record, or coart of equity or of admiralty, and in all cases matrimonial and testamentary, in any court having cognizance of causes matrimonial and testamentary, against any peer or lord of parliament of Great Britain, or against any of theknights, citizens, and burgesses, and the commissioners for shires and burghs of the Bouse of Commons of Great Britain for the time being, or against their or anr of their menial or any other servants, or any other person entitled to the privilege of Parliament of Great Britain? and no such action, suit, or any other process or proceeding thereupon shall at any time be impeached, stayed, or delayed, bj or under colour or pretence of any privilege of Parliament.

(4i In Mallet v. Hilton, 2 H. B. it was laid down by the Oourt of C. B., that a peremptory

undertaking should be sufficient in case of a first default. The Court of King's Bench requires an affidavit of excuse; but a very slight excuse is sufficient, even in case of a qui tam action; Stone v. Farey, 1 E. 554. The insolvency of the plaintiff is a sufficient cause, and a peremptory undertaking, under the circumstances, was not required; Fisher v. Hancock; 36 Geo. III., Tidd's Practice, c. 34.

CLASS VII.

Set Off*.

• Although the enactment* included In this Gifts* consist only of two sections, inclmded in Acts of which the provision* were temporary, containing regulations to the same effect with those which were permanently enacted by 32 Geo. II. c. 28, {ante. Class II. No. 29), the importance of the subject seemed to render it desirable, that they should occupy a distinct place in the present collection.

The following general view of the law of Set-Off has already been published in the Appendix to the translation of Pothier’s Treatise on Obligations. The additional passages are contained in brackets.

* It is evidently a principle of natural reason and justice, that when two parties are mutually indebted, the balance only shall be paid; and that one of the parties shall not be compellable to pay the debt which he has incurred, and be left to sue for that to which he is entitled. This principle forms an essential part of the civil law: and the effect of such mutual debts, in destroying each other, is distinguished by the term compensation/ the extinction or reduction of the one debt ensues immediately, and by operation of law upon the other, being contracted.

* By the common law of England, if the plaintiff was indebted to the defendant in as much or more than the defendant was indebted to him, it was no defence. Until the reign of Queen Anne, if a person who owed me 1000/. became a bankrupt, and I was indebted to him in 50A, I must have paid the 50/., and have been left to my chance of any dividend upon my larger demand; or, reversing the account, I must have paid the 1000/. entire, and have taken my chance of the dividend upon the 50/. If my debtor in the larger sum died, I must still have paid the debt due from myself, possibly for the satisfaction of his specialty creditors, and might have entirely lost the whole of my cross demand. The natural good sense of mankind was first shocked at this in the case of bankrupts, and it was provided for by 4XXAnne, c. 17. $ 11, and 5 Geo. II. c. 30. § 28. Where there was no bankruptcy, the injustice of not setting off (especially after the death of either party) was so glaring, that Parliament interposed, by the Acts of the 2 and 8 of Geo. II. and in any actions where there are mutual debts, the defendant may set off the debt due to himself, against that for which he is sued. Before the statutes which have been mentioned, where the nature of the employment, transaction or dealings, necessarily constituted an account, consisting of receipts and payments, debts and credits, the balance only was considered as the debt, and could only be recovered.—Fid, Green v. Fanner, 4 Burr. 2214.

* The doctrine which was thus introduced into the law of England partakes very much of the nature of compensation in civil law; but there is this material difference, that the debts are not in themselves and of right balanced and extinguished; that the right of Set-off is merely a defence to an action for the debt; that a defendant is not obliged, in any instance, to avail hum-self of this right, but may at his option pay, or on other grounds contest, the one debt, and bring a separate action for the other. If the creditor, to whom the larger debt is due, brings an action in which the other does not set off his mutual demand, but brings a counter-action, the debt due to the first may be set off in the action by the last, and is not extinguished by his first obtaining a verdict for his whole debt; and he may take advantage of it in the action against him, remitting so much of what he has recovered, as will reduce it to the balance; Baskerville r. Brown, et e contra, 2 Burr. 1229.

“ The principle that the debt is not extinguished by the right of set-off, is strongly illustrated by the rase of Pitts v. Carpenter, 1 Wils. 19. in which it was held that the plaintiff, to whom a larger debt than 40#. was originally due, but whose demand was reduced by set-off to less than that sum, might bring his action in a superior court, and was not within the provisions of a local Act, confining debts for less than 40*. to an inferior jurisdiction. [In the case of an extent, the debt due from a third person to a debtor of the crown is levied without any regard to the subsistence of a mutual debt, which might be set off, as between the debtor and creditor. This, like many other parts of the law of extent, certainly requires correction.]

* In the law of England, ns in the civil law, the right of compensation or set-off, is confined to debts; one injury cannot be balanced against another, nor an injury against a debt; Freeman v, Hyett, 1 Bl. Rep. 394. Neither can unliquidated damages, for not performing an agreement, be set off, either against another demand of a similar nature, or a debt; Ho wlett *. Strickland, Cowp. 56; Waigall r. Waters, 6 T. R. 488; or vice versa, a debt against these; Bulk N.P. 181. And this rule applies even when there is a bond with a penalty, which in point of form constitutes a debt, but the payment of which as such cannot be effectively enforced; Ned-riffe v. Hogan, Bull. N. P. 180. it may be added, that upon a bond for the payment of money,

Class VIL] Stt-off. tel

the Mflgr Ncmd) and not the ymlty ofthtlMid, U for the purposes of set-off considered as the debt; gG. II. c. 34. And by setting off ony money due under such a bond (as the arrears of an annuity), the bond is not extinguished. But certain stipulated damages which are precisely due according to the termsof a contract, or a penalty to which the defendant has become absolutely entitled, may be set off, these being certain liquidated debts; Fletcher v. Dyke, 3 T. R. 32. It was ruled, ia Eland «. Karr, 1 East, 37b. that it was no answer to a plea of setoff, that the defendant promised to pay the plaintiff in ready money. [And in Carnforth *. Rivett, 2 M. and . 510. in an action for goods sold, the defendant, upon notice of set-off, proved a bill of exchange acoepted by the plaintiff, and which came to the hands ef the plaintiff after the sale of the goods. It appeared that when the plaintiff demanded the money, he told him that his situation was very precarious, or he would not have Bold the goods so cheap; but ha was to have ready money; which the defendant admitted. The court held that the nUdntiff should have resisted the taking away of the goods without ready money, which he would have had a right to do by his agree meat; but that by suffering the defendant to have them without payment, he had receded from his agreement. If he once parts with them on credit, he lets in a set-off. See this case cited to/ru, on another point.]

“ The mutual debts must be due an the same right, and therefore a person cannot set off a demand in his own right against one, for which he is sued as executor, or the reverse; stat. 22 Geo. II. c. 22. s. 13. When a person continues tenant, or receiver to executors, after a testator’s death, he cannot set off against debts contracted by him in that capacity, debts due from the testator in hit life-time; Shipman v. Thomson, Bull. N. P* 180; Tegctmyer v. Lumley, Wittes, 261; Montague on Set-off, 32. Also if a debt is due to, or from several persons jointly, there can he no set-off on account of the debt of either of them singly; and a debt to or from a man in his own right cannot be set off against a debt in right of his wife. To this principle, and also to the public nature of the trust reposed in the assignees of a bankrupt, may be referred the decision that such an assignee cannot retain a dividend due to one of the creditors, by setting off a debt from the creditor to himself; Brown v. Bullen, Doug. 407.

“ But where two persons are indebted jointly mad eevemUy, that engagement as being several may be set off against the debt claimed by either of them individually; Fletcher v. Dyke, 3 T. R. 33. Also, a debt from or to a surviving partner, may be set off against that for which he sues or is sued, on his own account; Slipper r. Stid stone, 5 T. R. 403; French v. Andrade, 6 T. R. 582. (1)

“ It is a proposition Confirmed by all the preceding cases, that a debt cannot in general be set off, unless a counter action could he maintained between the same persons, and in the same characters. But there may be some exceptions to the literal application of this rule. For Instance, Bottomly sued Brook on a bond. It Was held to be a good cause of set-off, that the bond was given to Bottomly, as a trustee for Chancellor, and that Chancellor was indebted to the defendant; ehf. 1 T. R. 619. Bottomly v. Brook; and Winch v. Keely, cited ibid.

“ A debt may be assigned: uni, though no action can be maintained for it in the name of the assignee, yet ns men assignments have for various purposes been recognized in courts of law, it may be reasonably inferred, that after a person has assigned the debt doe to him, and notified the assignment to the debtor, he cannot set off that demand against one which may be due from himself; .on the other hand, it would be reasonable to allow it to be set off, by the person to whom it was assigned; at least, against any debt contracted after notice of the assignment; and that a debt due from such person might be set off, against the action nominally brought by the original creditor: bat 1 do not state these distinctions as having any higher authority than mere suggest km.

[It has been since held that a pica of set-off by the assignee of a bond for valuable consideration could not be supported. Lord EUenborough said, he was much more inclined to restrain than to extend the doctrine in Bottomly v. Brook. Cayley J. “ We have nothing to do in this place with any other legal rights; ” Wake v. Tinkler, 16 E. 440.

In Fair, assignee of Wilson, -r. M‘Ircr, 16 E. 130. the defendant purchased goods of the bankrupt, to be paid for in a bail at three mouths: the defendant offered in payment an acceptance of the bankrupt's own, received from P. and F. for the purpose; sad the object of the transaction appeared to be, on the whole, to cover P. and F. from the expected bankruptcy. It haring been held that an offer of such bill was not a performance of the contract, but a fraud; the qaettien remained as to the defendant’s right ef set-off; and it was ruled that the bill could not be set off by the defendants, who took the indorsement of it, not for themselves, hut for P. and F. and merely for the purpose of getting the bankrupt’s goods without paying for them, and held it merely as trustees of P. and F.; ana that although it was admitted that the defendants -could b*ve brought an action against Wilson on the bill, the court were of opinion that they could not set it off, not being bona fide holders in their own right. In the subsequent case of Gornforth v. Rivett, 2 M. and 6. 510. (mentioned supra as to the principal point) in which there

(I) Where a bond waa given to one of several partners in a bank, upon trust for them all, and for money advanced by the firm. It was held that the smotirtt might be set off against a debt -from thte firm; Crosse v.'dearth, 2 m. and

. 545: and joint and separate debts may be set off against each other by special agreement; as to which see Kennedy *. Homacfc, 2 Taunt. 170; but this does not depend upon the JfMMfcft.

It is a mistake to suppose that a title of sixty years is absolutely conclusive of the right; for if an estate tail is discontinued by fine, &c., a right of entry may arise at any indefinite period of time, by failure of the issue in tail, without haring suffered a recovery.

Writs of for* tnedon shall be sued within twenty years.

Entry into land, Ac.c. shall be made within twenty years.

For entries to avoid a fine, see 4XXAnne, c. 16. sect. 16.

(1) Ibis limitation extends to the rights of the lord of s manor as to mines, lands, Ac.c., within the manor $ Rich t>. Johnson, Sir. 1142; Boll, N.P. 102, by the name of Lord Collen v. Rich. So to the right of entry by a commoner, if the common has been inclosed twenty years j vi. Hawke v. Bacon, 2 Taunt. 160. As to the lord of a manor’s right of entry for a forfeiture, see Doe d. Tarrant v. Hellier, 3T.R. 172.

(2) But the right of entry may be pursued within twenty years after it attaches, although in the mean tune the.party may have had a different right, upon which more than twenty years* adverse enjoyment have attached. Thns, when a tenant in tail of lands in ancient demesne demised them, by fine, in the court of ancient demesne for three lives, and afterwards levied a fine of the reversion in the same court to the use of himself and his heirs; it being agreed, that the fines in that court did not bar the estate tail, it was held that the first fine created a discontinuance, and the second did not; and that although the issue in tail did not bring their formedon within twenty years after the death of their ancestor, they were not barred of their right of entry within twenty years from the determination of the lease for lives; Hunt v. Bourne, 1 Salk. 339, 2 Salk. 421. So where the devisor of an estate had made a lease for years, with clause of re-entry on payment of rent, and after his death the heir received the rent during the lease (being a period of more than twenty yean) without any steps being taken by thie devisee to recover the possession; it was held that the devisee was not barred, for that he could not have entered during die lease; and although a forfeiture was committed, he was

not obliged to enter; Doe d. Cook *. Danvers, 7 E. 299. Sqe also, as to the last point, 1 Ves. 278. The possession on which the statute attaches must also be adverse. A mortgagee la not barred by the possession of his mortgagor, paying interest; Lord Raym. 750 $ and see Keene d. Ld. Byron v. Dearden, 8 E. 248; Roe d. Pellat e. Ferrara, 2 B. and P. 842. The possession of one joint tenant, tenant In common, or parcener, as such, does not bar the right of entry of the other; but if the right of the other is denied, and the enjoyment is adverse, the statute attaches, such adverse possession being in effect an actual (raster; see Ford v. Grey, 1 Salk. 285; Reading v. Royston, 2 Salk. 422; Fairclahn t. Shackle ton, 3 Bur. 2604; Doe ». Protser, Cowp. 217; Peaceable t*. Read, I E. 568. In that caae Lord Kenyon said—“ Prime fdcii, the possession of one tenant in common Is that of another; and every case and datum hi the books is to that effect. But you may shew that one of them has been in possession, and baa received the rents and profits to his own use, without account to the other; and that the other has acquiesced in this for such a length of time as may induce a jury to presume an actual ouster of his companion: and there the line of presumption ends.”—Ecclesiastical persona or corporations are not generally barred by the statutes; Magdalen College case, 11 Rep. 786; 1 Roll. Rep. 151. Where an ecclesiastical person neglects to bring his action within ths time required, he himself wiD be barred, but not his successor; Flowd. 358.

f II. Provideo nevertheless, that if any person or persons, that is or shall be entitled to such writ or writs, or that hathjor shall have such r right or title of entry, be or shall be at the time of the said right or title first descended, accrued, come or fallen, within the age of one and twenty yean feme covert, non compos mentis, imprisoned or beyond the seas that then such person and persons, and his and their heir and heirs, shall or may, notwithstanding the said twenty years be expired, bring his action, or make his entry, as he might have done before this Act; so as such person and persons, or his or their heir and heirs, shall within ten Yeacsjiext after his and their full age, discoverture, coining of .fcuncTmindTenlargement out of prison, or coming into this realm, or death, (1) take benefit of and sue forth the same, and at no time after the said ten years. (2)

III. And be it further enacted, that all actions of trespass Quart clausum fregitj all actions of trespass, detinue, action sur trover, and replevin for taking away of goods and cattle, all actions of account and upon the case, other than such accounts as concern the trade of merchandize between merchant and merchant, () their factors or servants, all actions of debt grounded upon any lending or contract without specialty, (4) all actions of debt for arrearages of rent, (5) and all actions of assault, menace, battery, wounding ana imprisonment, or any of them, which shall be sued or brought at any time after the end of this present session of Parliament, shall be commenced and sued within the time and limitation hereafter expressed, and not after, (6)

(1) The word death must mean and refer to the death of the person to whom the right first accrued, and whose heir the claimant is; and the statute meant that the heir of every person, to which person a right of entry had accrued, during any of the disabilities should have ten years from the death of his ancestor, to whom the right first accrued after his disability, and who died under such disability (notwithstanding the 20 years from the first accruing of the title to the ancestor should have before expired). Per Lord Ellenborough. Doe d. George v. Jesson, 6 E. 80—in this case it was ruled, that the ancestor having died seised, leaving a son and a daughter, infants, and the son having died abroad, within age, the daughter was not entitled to 20 years to make her entry, after the death of her brother, but only to 10 years; more than 20 years having in the whole elapsed since the death of the father.

(2) Where the statute has once begun to attach, it continues to run, notwithstanding any subsequent disability; Doe dem. Duroure v. Jones, 4 T. R. 300. The ten years do not run at all while there is a continuance of the disabilities; but they run without intermission from the time that the disabilities first cease; Cottcrell v. Dalton, 4 Taunt. 826. In this case it was ruled, that the right having commenced against the elder brother, tenant in tail, continued to run against the younger.

(3) It is decided in several cases cited Williams's (n) 2 Saund. 127, that the statute only extends to accounts current, and not to accounts stated. In Cotes v. Harris, B.N. 149, Denison, J. held, that the clause extended only to cases where there were mutual and reciprocal demands between two persons. In Crunch v. Kirkman, N. P. Peake 121, Lord Kenyon overruled the objection that the exception extends only to accounts between merchants; but qu. as to the correctness of that opinion; vL Sheerman v. Withers, Ch. Cas. 152; Farrington v. Lee, 1 Mod. 270. In Catling ». Skoulding, 6*T. R. 189, Lord Kenyon said, that where the case is brought within the exception of the statute, the plaintiff is not barred, though there have not been any transaction between the parties for more than six years. But this was controverted in Duff r. The East India Company, 15 Vesey, 198; and in Barber t*. Barber, 18 Ves. 286, it was ex-\ pressly decided, that a demand between mcr- \ chants was barred by the statute, all accounts ! having ceased six >ears. See the observations of Lord Hardwickc, in Welford v. Liddle, 2 Vesey, 400. It was formerly held, that the exemption only extended to actions of account; but the law is now settled to be, that it extends to actions on the case.—See the cases previous to that of Duff v. The E. I. Comp., more fully stated; Williams's notes to 2 Saund. 127.

(4) The Act does not extend to debt for not setting out tithes; Cro. Car. 513:nor to debt for an escape, founded on I Ric. II. c. 12; 1 Saund. 38; 1 Lev. 191; 1 Sid. 306: nor to debt on award; . semble, 1 Lev. 273;

1 Sid. 415; 2 Saund. 63:nor debt for a copyhold fine; 1 Lev. 273:nor an action against a sheriff for money levied upon a f. ft.; 3 Mod. 312.

IV. And nevertheless be it enacted, That if in any the said actions or suits, judgment be given for the plaintiff, and the same be reversed by error, or a verdict pass for the plaintiff, and upon matter alleged in arrest of judgment, the judgment be given against the plaintiff, that he take nothing by his plaint, writ or bill, or if any the said actions shall be brought by original, and the defendant therein be outlawed, and shall after reverse the outlawry; that in all such cases the party plaintiff, his heirs, executors () or administrators, as the case shall require, may commence a new action or suit from time to time, within a year after such judgment reversed, or such judgment given against the plaintiff, Or outlawry reversed, and not after.

V. And be it further enacted, That in all actions of trespass (4) quare clausum fregit, hereafter to be brought, wherein the defendant or defendants shall disclaim in his or their plea, to make any title or claim to the land in which the trespass is by the declaration supposed to be done, and the trespass be by negligence or involuntary, the defendant or defendants shall be admitted to plead a disclaimer, and that the trespass was by negligence or involuntary, and a tender or offer of sufficient amends for such trespass before the action brought, whereupon or

After judgment or nonsuit in a quare clausum fregit, the plaintiff is barred to renew the suit.

in actions upon debt, upon nil debet; but in assumpsit, and other actions enumerated in this section, it is necessary to plead it, although the cause of action upon the face of the declaration may appear to have been beyond the time of limitation. In all cases of assumpsit, the plea may be, that the action did not accrue within six years; hut where the cause of action arises not upon the promise, but upon some collateral event, it is not sufficient to plead non assumpsit. In assumpsit by an executor or administrator, upon promises to the deceased, if the plaintiff replies a promise within six years, he cannot give in evidence a romise to himself; Deane v. Crane, Salk. 28; arrell v. Wine, 3 East, 409. It is therefore proper, in all cases of doubt, to have two sets of counts, one upon promises to the deceased, the other to the plaintiff. The limitation attaches with reference to the actual commencement of the action, and not according to the supposition of the record, or the teste of the wnt. See the cases upon pleadings, with reference to the statute, Williams's n. 2 Saund. 63; and Gray r. Finder, 2 B. and P. 427.; Harrington t>.Taylor, 15 E. 378 \ Leapcr v. Tat ton, 16 E. 420. If an action is commenced in time in an inferior court, and removed by the defendant into the King's Bench, after the time of limitation, whereupon the plaintiff declares de novo, the suit iff not barred; Matthew r. Phillips, 2 Salk. 424. —As to acknowledgments by which a case is taken out of the statute, see note at the end of

the class, [6] [7] [8].

(1) Where the defendant, in assault, pleaded not guilty within six years, it was ruled on demurrer that the plea was bad:an immaterial issue. But in M&cfadzcn r. Olivant, 6 East, 387, in which the question arose whether crim. con. was case or a trespass, and if trespass, whether the limitation was not four years; it was held, that, supposing it to be trespass, the objection must be taken by special demurrer, as four years were included in six; and a plea of not guilty within six years, includes the allegation of not guilty in fotm In Cooke v. Sayer, 2 Bur. 753, a plea of not

Guilty within six years in such case appears to vc been held good j but it is only mentioned incidentally, upon a question of costs, and it does not appear on the report whether the discussion related to the action being within the statute in general, or upon the distinction between six years and four.

(2) Where the words are actionable without special damage, the statute is a bar. Secus, where special damage is the ground of the action; Saunders v. Edwards, 1 Sid. 95. Raym. 61. The limitation does not extend to slander of title; Law v. Harwood, Cro. Car. 141; and vi. note (1) infra, p. 232.

THE FOLLOWING GENERAL VIEW OF THE

STATUTES of limitations, and presumptions founded upon length

OF TIME,

Was originally published in the Appendix to the Translation of Pothier. The Additions are, as In other instances, distinguished by brackets; and the additional notes are further distinguished from the original ones by the references being in Figures.

[11 44 In stating the English law respecting limitations, and presumptions founded upon length ef time, I snail 1st advert to the provision respecting ordinary debts; 2d, (deviating from my usual plan, which does not embrace the law of real estates) to the ease of ejectments; and, 3d, to those cases in which, without any legislative provision, the courts of justice have adopted rales, analogous to those constituted by statute; without dwelling upon actions for ia« juste *, or provisions of a special and particular nature.

M By statute 21 Jac. 1. Ch. 16. f 3. all actions of account, and upon the case, other than meb Recounts as concern the trade of merchandise, between merchant and merchant, their fhetors ev servants, all actions of debt grounded on any landing, or contract without specialty, and HI actions of debt for arrearages of rent, shall be commenced within six years after the canae of action.

By the Isaac section, actions at trespass, defiant and npM, must be commenced within six yen; actions of amault, battery, wounding, and imprisonment, within four yen; and actions of slander within two vein.

* By f 4. if judgment is giren for the plaintiff, and afterwords reversed by* writ ef error, er meted; or if the defendant is outlawed, and the outlawry reversed, a new aetien may, from time to time, be commenced within a year afterwards.

“ And by f 7. if any person entitled to any such cause of treepaes, dettmoo, action for Mover, replevin, actions of accounts, actions of debts, actions of trespass for assault, menace, battery, wonndbm, or Imprison cut, notion* upon the case for weeds, at the time of the cans* of action, accruing, shall be under the age of twcaty.oac yean, foam assert, sm comp*i momtio.

within the time before limited, after being of full age, discovert, of sane memory, at large, and returned from beyond seas, as other persons not having the same impediments should have done.

“ And by and 5 Ann. c. 16. where any persons, against whom there is cause of action, shall be beyond sea at the time of such cause of action accruing, the persona who shall have •nch cause of action, shall have liberty to bring an action within such times as are limited by the Statute of James, after their return.

[2} “ I. The principles stated by Pothier, that prescription cannot begin to run, but from the time when the creditor might institute his demand, is included in the very terms of the statute, so that if credit is given, or if a debt is contracted upon condition, it is manifest that no cause of action can arise until the credit is expired, or the condition performed, and consequently that before those periods the time of limitation cannot commence. When the defendant received money belonging to an intestate's estate, it was held that the limitation only commenced from the time of administration being granted; for until that time there was no person entitled to receive the money; Carey v. Stephenson, 2 Salk. 421; see Wittermhiem r. Hie Countess of Carlisle, 1 H. Bl. 601.

“lam not aware of any case in which the subject of a contract, including several distinct times of payment, has fallen under consideration. To such a case the terms of the statute may be literally applied, so as to run for each portion from the respective times of payment; and I see no ground upon which the operation of it can be prevented, though, under these circumstances, the courts would in all probability be peculiarly disposed to favour every implication of an acknowledgment, extended to the time appointed for the latest payment.

“ Where there are mutual accounts between the parties, an acknowledgment will be implied at the time of the last transaction:this will be more particularly mentioned presently. But the particular exception in the statute of accounts, between merchant and merchant, seems to have a more extensive effect; for it has been held that to such cases the statute does not at all attach, and therefore where the cause of action is brought within that exception, no length of time can be alleged as a bar to the demand; Catling v. Skoulding, 6 T. R. 191. (a) [But this doctrine has been since overruled; see notes in the statute.] This exception is clearly confined to the case of mutual accounts and reciprocal demands between two persons in trade, and does not extend to cases between a tradesman and his customers, for these are not merchant's accounts; Bui. N. P., 149.

“ The continuance of a mutual account of debts and credits is held sufficient evidence of an acknowledgment: for, where an action was brought for several years' rent, and the tenant had supplied his landlord with shop-goods during the latter period of the tenancy, it was held that the statute did not apply. Lord Kenyon said, “ Here are mutual items of. account, and I take it to be clearly settled, as long as I have any memory, that every new item and credit in account, given by one party to the other, is an admission of there being some unsettled account between them, the amount of which is afterwards to be ascertained; and any act which the jury may consider as an acknowledgment of its being an open account, is sufficient to take the case out of the statute." Where all the articles are on one side, it seems, according to a case cited by his Lordship, and decided by Mr. Justice Dennison, that the last item, which happens to be within six years, shall not draw after it those that are of longer standing; Catling v. Skoulding, ub. sup.

p] “ In the exceptive clause of persons under certain protections, most of the causes of action before enumerated are repeated; but the clause does not mention actions on the case generally, but only actions on the case for words. It has however been decided to have a general application, and to include the common action upon promises, for recovery of debts; actions of debt are included in the enumeration; and though there is a casuaLomisaion of expression in the excepting clause, it is impossible to suppose that this exception was intended to apply only partially in respect of the objects mentioned in the general purview; Vide Rocht-schilt e. Leibman, 2 Str. 836.

“ Upon the effect of the exception as to persons beyond seas, it has been observed by the Court of Common Pleas, that if the plaintiff is a foreigner, and doth not come to England in fifty years, he has still six years after his coming to England to bring his action; and if he never comes to England himself, he has always a right of actidU whilst he lives abroad, and so have his executors or administrators after his death. An infant may sue before he comes of age, if he pleases; but if he does not, he has six years after he comes of age to bring his action. While any of the disabilities mentioned in the Statute of Limitations continue, the party may, but is not obliged, to bring his action; Stathorst v. Graeme, 3 Wils. 145. It has been also decided, that if some of the persons, having a joint cause of action, are in the kingdom, and others beyond seas, the statute attaches as if they had all been in the kingdom; Perry v. Jackson, 4 T.R. 516. The term beyond teas, is strictly construed, and the exception is not allowed to extend to a person in Scotland; King r. Walker, 1 Bl. Rep. 286.

[4] “ In case six years have not elapsed at the time of the creditor’s death, the executor is allowed to commence an action after the expiration of six years, provided he does so within one year after the death of Mb testator. This is said to be by the equity af the clause, which gives

(o) Vide several cases cited, Williams's notes to p. 2, Saund. 127,

Class VIII.] Limitation!. 955

a year to commence a new action, in case the first jndgment has been arrested or reversed; Bui. N. P. 150; Wilcock v. Hudgins, 2 Str. 907. However reasonable it may be to allow such an exception, it is not very obvious how any inference to that effect can be drawn from the clause to which it is referred. (1)

[5] “ It is a rule fully established, that when the time required by any statute of limitations has begun to run, it shall continue, notwithstanding the party entitled afterwards falls .under any of the protections, or, as they are usually called, disabilities: for instance, if a . woman marries the day she comes of age, or a person is thrown into prison the day after his

arrival in the kingdom, the time will run without interruption, from the time of coming of age, or of the arrival. If it has commenced against the ancestor, it will continue against his infant heirs. A distinction was lately endeavoured to be taken between a voluntary disability, such as marriage, and one which was involuntary, such as imprisonment; but this was not allowed; Doe v, Jones, 4T.R. 300; Smith*. Hill, 1 Wils. 134. (2)

[6] “ According to the modern determinations of English courts, the admission of a debt has a more extensive effect than that which is stated by Pothier; for it is now an established rule, the application of which is of daily experience, that the slightest acknowledgment of the obligation not having been discharged, is sufficient not only to interrupt the operation of the

- statute, but to revive from that time the right of action, which was extinct.

“ Cases have occurred, in which a person, by mentioning in conversation that he bad contracted a debt, but should not pay it, as it was of above six years* standing, or by declaring at the time of his being served with process, that he should on that account resist the payment, has deprived himself of that right, upon which it was his intention to insist.

“ What acts or declarations constitute an acknowledgment, is a question of fact; it was therefore ruled, that a judge ought to have submitted the effect of a letter, couched in terms of ambiguity and evasion, to the decision of a jury, instead of deciding upon the insufficiency of it, of his own authority; Lloyd v. Maund, 2 T. R. 760.

“ A distinction prevails between such an Act as shall prevent the operation of the Statute of Limitations, and such as shall repel the defence of an obligation being contracted during minority. In the first case, a mere admission that the debt remains undischarged is sufficient; in the second, there must be an actual promise. And the distinction is not without foundation; for, in the first case, the obligation is founded upon the fact, the length of time operates as a defeazance, and the admission furnishes evidence, that the presumption, which was the cause of providing a bar, is contrary to the fact. In the other case, there is no legal obligation in the first instance; there is only a moral obligation, which may be a sufficient consideration to support an actual promise. The mere acknowledgment of such moral obligation can have no legal effect; an actual intention to assume a personal responsibility is the only foundation of a legal demand, and that intention must be manifested by acts or declarations inconsistent with the contrary disposition.

[7] “ The effect of the statute is confined to a right of action, it is not to collateral purposes regarded as an extinction of the debt; therefore, if a person by will directs his debts to be

Sad, those which were barred by the statute arc held to be included. {This doctrine is taken r granted in many cases, and was generally supposed to be the established rule of Courts of Equity; but in Burke r. Jones, 2 V. and B.275, the Vice-Chancellor, upon a full review of the authorities, decided the contrary; and said, that there was no decision that a devise for the payment of debts had the effect of reviving debts barred by the statute at the death of the devisor.] “ Neither is a creditor, whose debt is barred by the statute, precluded from taking out commission of bankrnpt, at least, unless the objection is taken by the bankrupt himself; Quantock v. England, 5 Bur.: and even in that case, I have known the argument, in support of the opposite proposition, disallowed, (a) And it is clearly no objection to the proof of a debt, under a commission, that it was contracted above six years before the commission issued. [This yeas generally understood to be the law at the time when the present discussion was published; but the contrary has been since ruled in the cases, ex parte Dewdney, 15 Ves. 479; and the dividends paid on such proof were ordered to be refunded; . C. 2 Rose, B. L. 59, n.— See the discussion on this subject, 1 Christ. B. L. 221.]

[(1) See the discussion on this subject in Mr. Selwyn's Note, in his abridgment of the law of Niti Priux, p. 133, 3d Edition. From the cases which he cites, he seems to intimate, that the only rule which can be lsid down with safety is, that the executor must bring his action within a reasonable time. But upon examining the cases cited themselves, I do not find it clearly ascertained, that in any instance an action has been allowed to be commenced in the first instance, by an executor or administrator, after the proper time of limitation has expired; and if not, all the cases in which that right has been recognized resolve themselves into mere dicta. In Kensey v. Heywood,

1 Lutw. 256, the action was commenced by the deceased within the six years, and abated by his death; and a new original was taken out by the executor within the following term, which was held to bring the case within the equity of the statute, as a continuance of the original action.]

[Part IV.

K] u A partial payment by one of the dnven of a joint and Mvtnl promissory note, m haw to be a sufficient acknowledgment to prevent the operation of the statute in favour of the other*; Whitcomb v. Whiting, Doug. 663. And I conceive it may be stated generally, that an acknowledgment, in whatever manner, by one of several joint debtors, snail be obligatory upon all, and that the distinction between such acknowledgment being made within, or after the period of limitation, would not be allowed.

* It has been decided, that where one joint debtor became a bankrupt, the payment of a dividend by hia assignees ahouid operate aa an acknowledgment to effect the other: Jackson ». Fairbank, 3 H. HI. 340. This was certainly carrying the matter to the farthest possible extent} far the right to prove upon the estate was not affected by the Statute of Limitations, and could not have been resisted by the assignees.

“ By the several decisions which have taken place, the effect of the Statute of Limitations seems to be almost reduced to a mere matter of presumptive evidence. (1) However conformable such a course of proceeding may be to original principles, which render it expedient to fix a limitation of rime, it might be justly questioned, whether any thing less than an acknowledgment, intended to import the subsistence of a valid obligation, should be allowed to satisfy the true construction of the statute, (a)

“ It may not be improper here to hint, that considerable caution should be applied to the evidence of persona brought to prove a mere verbal acknowledgment. Those persona are often •elected to apply to the party charged as debtor, on account of their canning in catching at any ambiguous expression, and in representing the case most favourably for those by whom they are employed. To this it may be added, that such evidence is seldom exposed to the temporal risks which attend the commission'of perjury. (6)

[(1) In Leaper v. Tatton, 16 E. 420, Lord EUenborough says—“The limitation of the statute is only presumptive payment. If the defendant’s own acknowledgment that he baa not paid be shewn, it does away the statute.” See also a point of pleading in that case.]

M (a) It is several years since these observations have been committed to writing. By a very recent decision it was established, that saying, “ Ido not consider myself as owing Mr.

B. a farthing, it being more than six years sines I contracted:I nad the goods and paid part, and 26/. remains due, ” was an acknowledgment which took the debt out of the statute. The court said, that whatever their opi-opinion upon the statute might have been, had the question been new, yet after the long train of decisions upon the subject, it was necessary to abide by the construction which had been put upon it; in conformity with which they thought themselves bound to hold that what was said by the defendant was sufficient acknowledgment of the pre-existing debt, to create an assumpsit, so as to take the case out of the statute; Bryan v. Horseman, 4 East, 699. This decision was certainly in conformity with the series of precedents upon the subject; but as to the general precedent of adhering to the mere authority of former cases, in opposition to the positive terms of an Act of Parliament or an established maxim of law, of placing a secondary above a primary authority, much doubt may fairly, and without disrespect, be entertained. Where the return to the ancient principle would be attended with material detriment, as by disturbing titles to real estates, held under the sanction of rules, which, however erroneous in themselves, have been established by a series of precedents, the reason for an adherence to the precedents evidently preponderates } but where there will be no inconvenience beyond the immediate case, where the general conseqneaces will be wholly prospective, I cannot but adhere to the opinion, (which I have perhaps expressed with obtrusive

repetition) that the courts of justice have as much authority now to restore the law, as they have had before to subvert it: and that a correct principle of law is an authority entitled to higher respect than an erroneous set of precedents. Considering the law, however, on the particular subject, as now beyond the reach of argument, and aware how much my own opinion upon the effect of precedent is different from that which usually prevails in practice, I think it not irrelevant to suggest to persons whose claims are barred by the statute, sad who wish to obtain an acknowledgment of the subsistence of the debt, the utility of filing a bill of discovery, obliging the defendant to state whether the debt was contracted, and whether it has been paid. If the subsistence of the debt is admitted, (and without perjury it cannot be denied) it will not, if there is any consistehcy of decision, be of any avail to add a claim to the protection of the statute.” [See as to pleading the statute in such case, part, [22]. In Cobham v. Marsh, 3 Taunt. 380, it was ruled that saying, “ 1 owe yon not a farthing, for it is more than six years since, ” could not be left to the jury as an acknowledgment; and foe Birchall v. Keppel, 1 New Rep. 20. In the subsequent case of Leaper v. Tatton, .referred to in note to [8], mmte, the defendant saying “ that he had been liable, but was not liable then, because the bill was out of date, ” was ruled to be an acknowledgment, taking the case out of the statute.—It seems quite impossible to reconcile these casco. See Baillie v. Sibbald. 15 Ves. 185.]

“ (6) Mr. Serjeant Williams observes to the same effect, that it might perhaps have been as well if the letter of the statute had been strictly adhered to; it is an extremely beneficial law, on which, as has been observed, 2 Salk. 421, Green v. Revitt, the security of all men depends, aad^is therefore to he favoured; and although it will now and then prevent a man from recovering an honest debt, yet it is his own fault that he postponed his action so long;

Class VIII.] Limitations. *37

[9] “ It hat been argued, that where a party has been induced by fraud, to pay money, the Statute of Limitations does not run, or at least only runs from the time when the fraud is dit-corered; but the allegations in the particular case were deemed not sufficient to raise the question; Bree v. Holbeach, Doug. 655. I can, however, hardly think that the argument is tenable. Courts of equity have, in the exercise of that discretionary power which they are allowed to possess, adopted an analogy to the Statute of Limitations, with an exception in cases of fraud; and it seems from thence to be inferred, that the courts of law must adopt, in the construction of the statute, au exception analogous to that of the courts of equity. But the exposition of a statute is imperative, and not discretionary5 and to qualify the express provisions of an Act, by exceptions deduced from its supposed spirit, however conducive to the justice of particular cases, is a most alarming precedent. Besides, the ground of introducing a period of limitations is the lapse of memory, and the loss of evidence. A transaction, which, when explained, is perfectly fair, may be attended with circumstances of a fraudulent aspect, and it would be unjust to let those circumstances induce a claim, where the evidence capable of affording an explanation is lost The qualification deduced from the time of discovering the fraud, would be attended with continual uncertainty; for circumstances may appear to give a man the first discovery of a fact with which he has been long acquainted, but the knowledge of which rests in his own mind.

[10] 44 There is another nflfe in courts of equity which may deserve a different consideration as applied to legal demands, vis. that length of time is no bur in the case of a trust. Where a man deposits money in the hands of another, to be kept for his use, the possession of the cus-todee ought to be deemed the possession of the owner until an application and refusal, or other denial of the right; for, until then there is nothing adverse, and I conceive that upon principle no action should be allowed in these cases, without a previous demand; consequently, that BO limitation should be computed further back than such demand. And I think it probable, that under these circumstances, the limitation would not be allowed to attach, though the other part of the observation would be as probably disallowed; for a sweeping rule has been by some means introduced into practice, that an action is a demand; whereas every action In its nature supposes a preceding default: where money is improperly received, or goods are bought without any specific credit, or even where money is borrowed generally, there is held to be an immediate duty, and it is a perfectly legitimate conclusion, that no demand can be necessary, in addition to the duty itself. But wherever there is a loan, in the nature of a deposit, or any other confidential duty is contracted, the mere creation of that duty, unaccompanied with the absolute breach of it, by denial, or inconsistent conduct, ought not to be considered as a ground of action.

[11] 44 The commencement of an action within the six years of course prevents the Statute o£ Limitations having effect. There are many cases upon the subject, the mult of which is, that the actual day of commencing the action is the time to be considered, without regard to those fictitious relations, which, for general purposes, are deemed the commencement of the suit, and that the suit so commenced must be that which is effectively proceeded in.

[12] 44II. By the same statute of 21 Jac. I. c. 16, no person shall make entry Into any lands, but within twenty yean after his right shall first descend or accrue; but in case the persons entitled shall be at the time of such right first descended, or accrued, within the age of twenty-one yean, feme covert, non compos mentis, or beyond the seas, such persons, or their heln, may make an entry as before the Act, so as they take the benefit of the Act within ten yean after the disability removed. The right of entry is essential to the maintenance of an action of ejectment, which ia now the almost invariable course of proceeding for the recovery of lands.

Writs of right may be sued out within sixty year *, which is the longest period of limitation allowed by law, with the like exceptions as to infants, Ac.c.

(The present limitation of sixty yean has a considerable effect in nosing difficulties to titles, while It has very little effect in the actual preservation of rights, as it is scarcely once in a year that any real action is brought, and when brought is so little countenanced that every difficulty and embarrassment is thrown in the way of it: and in this, as in all other cases, it would seem manifestly inconsistent to admit the existence of a law as beneficial, while the application of it is uniformly discountenanced as injurious. The usual exceptions are also rather difficulties 1b the way of the title than matters of any real practical unity; and on the general scale of mUss advantage, the balance seems evidently to be in favour rather of letting a complete title be acquired by a peaceable possession of twenty yean, than of letting a person come from beyond sea to disturb such title at any indefinite distance of time. So with respect to coverture: the husband has so great an interest xa the acquisition of the property of his wife, ' that it is very rarely indeed that any action is brought In which advantage is taken of the exception; and the instances of persons being imprisoned for a length of time, which would affect the principle of limitation are so very few, that any particular advantage which could arise from the preservation of their rights woald be much inferior, with reference to the general scale of public utility, SB the common advantage of rendering titles secure after the proposed period of limitation. The term DimsbiUtios, which Is used as denoting the several cases of persons who are

besides which, the permitting of evidence of years, seems to he a dangerous inlet to per-promises and acknowledgments within the six jury."

338

Limitations•

[Part IV.

excepted from the Statutes of Limitations, is in some degree calculated to mislead, as there it no disability in point of law; and inability with respect to expense is not of itself a protection from the general operation of the statutes. The exception of the rights of infants is of a more favourable nature, and hAs the advantage of being confined to a definite period; but even this case appears to be sufficiently protected by the regulation of the statute of 21 Jac. I>]

“ In case of a fine with proclamations, all persons are barred after five years from the levying of the fine, except persons under disability and persons whose right shall accrue after proclamation, who must proceed within five years after the disability is removed, or the right accrues; 4H.VlI.c.24.fl)

“ By 9 Geo. III. c. 16, the King (who is not bound by general Acts of Parliament) is precluded from claiming any lands, &c. except within sixty years after the title accrued.

[13] “ The effect of the Statute of Limitations in respect to ejectments, is different from that which is Applied to it in case of debts, whereby, as we have seen, it is reduced to little more than a mere presumption; for a possession of twenty years gives an actual possessory title, which may be made the substantive ground of a claim, without being subject to any defeazance, by evidence of an anterior and adverse right; Taylor v. Atkins, 1 Bur. 119.

“ So, a possession of sixty years or of five years, after levying a fine, is not only a bar to any judicial proceeding, but a complete and substantive title, subject to the several exceptions which are introduced in favour of persons under age, or having other protections and disabilities.

“ In order to sustain an ejectment, there must therefore have been an actual possession, consistent with the title claimed, within twenty years; and acts which merely prove a property, but not a possession, are insufficient.

[U] But the Statute of Limitations can only operate in case of an adverse possession; therefore, if one berson has held the estate on the joint account of himself and another, or by the permission of the person really entitled, and without claiming any inconsistent right, the original title is not affected. Whether the possession of one person is adverse to, or consistent with the title of another, is, in every case, a question of fact, to be collected by a jury, from all the circumstances; see Doe v. Prosser, Cowp. 217; Page v. Selby, Bui. N. P. 102, and notes to 21 Jac. 1.

“ The observation that if the statute has once begun to operate, it continues to run, notwithstanding any subsequent disability, has already been mentioned, and this rule has been more frequently applied to the case of titles than of contracts.

[15] “ We have seen that, according to the civil law, a prescription which began against the heir, continued against the substitute. In the law of England I take it to be clear, that the contrary is the case, and that no laches of the tenant for life, or in tail, can operate against those who are entitled in remainder, unless the adverse possession was paramount to that of the person from whom the several claims arc derived. Such indeed is the literal construction of the Act, and the application of it in practice is perfectly familiar.

“ But the laches of the tenant in tail falls upon his issue, claiming under the same limitation. [And by Cotterell v. Dutton, 4 Taunt. 426, the laches of the elder brother, upon whom the right first descends, bars the right of the younger.]

[16] “ III. The utility of fixing a period of time, after which, rights that have not been asserted or acknowledged, shall be considered as extinct, has induced the courts of justice in many instances to follow the example of the legislature, and to adopt a limitation of time, which shall be conclusive, for the bar of a claim, or the protection of a possessory enjoyment. And the period adopted for this purpose is almost invariably twenty years.

“ The present view of the subject does not extend to those cases in which the lapse of time ia merely considered as a matter of circumstantial evidence; and as such, is either alone, or in conjunction with other circumstances, relied upon as material in respect of an individual case. The effect of it in this point of view may fairly vary according to the different impressions of those to whom the decision of questions of fact properly belongs, and is perfectly distinct from the application of a general rule of presumption.

[17] “ The Statute of Limitations, as we have seen, only extends to actions of debt, founded upon any loan or contract, without specialty. This, of course, excludes bonds and all debts secured by deed; but it is now an established rule that after a lapse of twenty years, without payment of interest, or other acknowledgment, payment shall be presumed. And though this is only a circumstance for the jury to found a presumption upon, as it is a presumption universally applied, it is in a great measure attended with the same effect as an absolute bar. f2)

sufficient to induce a presumption in the particular case; but any consideration of that kind falls within the distinction above referred to; see Oswald v. Leigh, 1 T. R. 270.

“ It is a general rule, that a person shall not be allowed lo make evidence for himself; but it has been held that an indorsement of the payment of interest upon a bond, made ten years before the presumption attached, ought to be left to the jury to decide, whether it was made with the privity of the obligor; on the other hand, where the indorsement was made after the expiration of twenty years, the evidence was rejected as inadmissible, and the Chief Justice took the distinction (manifestly founded in reason and good sense,) that in the preceding case the indorsement was admitted because it appeared to have been made at a time when it could not have been thought necessary to encounter the presumption; Searle v. Lord Barrington,

2 Stra. 826; 2 Lord llaym. 1370; Tamer v. Crisp, 2 Stra. 827.

[18] •* Our courts of equity have in most instances adopted the presumption of a demand having been satisfied or a right extinguished, after the lapse of twenty years, provided these are no intermediate acts by which that presumption is repelled. Hie most common application of this principle is, that after a person, to whom an estate has been conveyed by way of mortgage, has been twenty years in possession, without rendering any account, the equity of redemption shall be held to nave been released or abandoned; but if there are any acts within the twenty years admitting the relative characters of mortgagor and mortgagee, £1) the presumption is destroyed, and the time can only be computed from the last act which is indicative of such an admission.

[19] “ It is a maxim in equity that no length of time is a bar in cases of fraud:where the fraudulent act is clear and manifest, the application of this rule is perfectly proper and consistent with the discretionary powers of a court of equity; but where the fraud is to be inferred from a complication of facts, and the delay in adducing the charge is not satisfactorily accounted for, it may be right to reflect upon the principles, on account of which any limitation is introduced, and which principally regard the difficulty of accounting for the particulars of transactions obliterated from the memory, and of which the witnesses may be dead or dispersed. This topic occurred in the case of Deloraine v. Brown, 3 Bro. Cha. 633, which was decided upon a collateral point; but the Master of the Rolls, in a subsequent caseN said, he referred to the arguments of counsel to shew that, even in a case of gross fraud, the court does not do justice by decreeing an account, after a considerable length of time, against executors, legatees, and innocent nersons claiming under the fraudulent party; see 2 Ves. jun. 92, Hercy v. Din-woody. (2)

[20] “ It is also held, that no length of time shall operate as a bar in cases of trust; but this rule can only be applied between the trustee and the party interested in the execution of the trust, and cannot be opposed to the right of a third penon claiming in opposition to both; (3) and even as between the immediate parties, where the trust relates to some act of an evanescent nature, such as the payment of a sum of money, and not to any permanent interest, the length of time may be fairly regarded as evidence of performance.

[21] “ The following recent cases will shew, in a clear point of view, the regard paid by a court of equity to length of time in general, with the disregard of that circumstance, where the inconvenience which might otherwise arise was fully obviated.

“ A suit was instituted for a legacy, which was resisted on the ground of presumed payment, arising from the length of time (being above forty years) which had elapsed without any demand, and because all the persons who could throw light upon the question were dead, and the claim was disallowed. Lord Commissioner Eyre observed, that it is a presumption of fact, in legal proceedings, before juries, that claims, the most solemnly established upon the face of them, will be presumed to be satisfied after a certain length of tune. Courts of equity would do very ill by not adopting that rule. So essential is it to general justice, that though (he presumption has often happened to be against the truth of the fact, yet it is better, .for the ends of general justice, that the presumption should be made and favoured, and not be easily rebutted, than to let in slight evidence of demands of this nature, from which infinite mischjpf and injustice might arise. If he could indulge conjecture, he doubted about the payment of the legacy; he knew that in Wales there is a pious reverence for the representatives of the family, mod that the other relations are unwilling to press them, and will take these demands upon them by a little at a time; but the interests of general justice require that demands should not be afterwards enforced in this way; and Lord Commissioner Ashhurst said, that all statutes of limitations and prescriptions, analogous to them, are to be favoured; Jones v. TubcrvUle, 2 Ves. Jun. 11.

“ In the case of Pickering v. Lord Stamford, 2 Ves. jun. 272, 581, a suit was instituted by persons claiming as next of kin of Thomas Walton, who died above thirty years before; having directed by his will that his personal estate should be applied to such charitable purposes as his

executors should direct. Hie executors established a school; cud the object of the suit su to recover so much of the personalty, vested In the mortgagees, as had not been applied (all dispositions by will of money secured by mortgage to charitable uses being void, by the statute of Mortmain; . Hie Master of the Rous, Sir R. P. Arden, upon the first hearing of the ease, directed an inquiry to be made into the particular circumstances, without prriudfoe as to the result; and upon that occasion observed, that if a party, having knowledge of his lights, will sit still, and, without asserting them, permit persons to act as if they did not exist, to acquire interests, and consider themselves as owners of property to which the other will not assert his right, there is no reason why every presumption should not arise, as in the case of a bond.— Upon the Inquiry which was directed, it appeared that the accounts had been kept so regularly, that there was no difficulty in ascertaining the personal estate at the death of the testator. Hie Matter of the Rolls, upon a full and able view of all the circumstances of the case, decided in favour of the claim of the next of kin. Hie following are the passages of his opinion more immediately applicable to the subject before us:—4 The bill certainly requires very extraordinary circumstances to sustain it at so late a period; and the first question is, whether, at this distance of time, it is too late to make the claim ? The question in all the cases is, whether there are motives of public policy, or private inconvenience, to induce the court to say, that under all the circumstances the suit ought not to be entertained ? It is a very sensible rule, that parties shall not, by neglecting to bring forward their demands, put others to a state of inconvenience, subjecting them to insuperable difficulties. If, from the plaintiff's lyiag-by, it Is impossible for the defendants to render the accounts be calls for, or it will subject them to great inconvenience, be must suffer, or the court will interpose what is the best ground, public convenience. The question is whether these principles apply to this case ? Bnt first, I'shall mention another ground; the presumption that the demand itself has in some manner been satisfied or released; that is a ground perfectly different from a bar, and prevails as much in a court of equity, as it has.by modern determinations been wisely held to do at law. Every presumption that can be fairly made, shall be made against a stale demand. It may arise from the acts of the parties; or the very forbearance to make the demand affbrds a presumption, either that the claimant is conscious it was satisfied, or intended to relinquish it.' It will not be necessary to state the examination of the particular circumstances from which his honour very accurately concluded, that it was impossible by any fair presumption to infer, that the parties, being cognizant of their rights, slept upon them, or ever intended to relinouish, what lie must say upon the whole complexion of the case, they never knew they had a right to.

M 4 If the accounts of the personal estate (he proceeded to say) could not now be obtained, mid ft was impossible to know to what the plaintiffs were entitled, that is a sufficient reason for saying, they should not have It, and rob the charity, because they could not tell what belonged to them, and what to the charity; bnt that unfortunately is not the doe, Therefore, desiring to be understood by no means to give any countenance to those stale demands, but upon the circumstances that there is nothing inducing great public or private Inconvenience, that the accounts are found, and that the trustees are not called upon to account for what has been disbursed, I am bound to decide in favour of the plaintiffs. ’

[22] fa Blewkt v. Thomas, 2 Ves. Jim. 609, length of time was pleaded in equity, as matter of defence, and as Inducing the presumption, that the demand was satisfied; and the plea was allowed. But in Pearson v. Belchier, 4 Ves. 627, the Master of the Rolls, while he held that a bfil could not be entertained, on account of length of time, said, that it could not be pleaded In bar in the Court of Chancery. See also as to the following cases respecting the allowance or disallowance of length of time, in opposition to an eqintable claim; Earl of Deioraine v. Brown, 3 Bro. Ch. 633; Hercy v. Dinwoody, 4 Bro. Ch. 257, 2 Ves. jun. 87; Ackerly r. Roe, 5 Ves. 565; H&rmood v. Oglander, 6 Ves. 199, 8 Ves. 106. (1) In the case of Sutton v. Earl of Scarborough, 9 Ves. 71. (Just published since this sheet was sent to the press) the Court of Chancery allows a plea of the statute of limitations to a bill in the nature of an action for money had and received, both as to the discovery and relief; but the decision does not affect the case of a mere bill of discovery. (2)

[23] 44 None of the statutes of limitations contain any provision in favour of incorporeal rights, (except in case of rents). According to the roles of law, the right to these can only be founded upon an actual grant, or an immemorial prescription, which supposes a grant. But fa order to establish a right, as founded upon a grant, It would be unreasonable to expect the production of the grant itself, as a requisite indispensable to the support of the title which is derived from ft. A long continued enjoyment, not otherwise to be accounted for, may, after such a period of time aa renders It probable that the deed may be lost or destroyed, be fairly considered as evidence of its former existence; and from such evidence, the Jury may be ffairty Induced to Infer the truth of any proposition, which is not opposed by stronger evidence on the other side. But the decisions of our courts have carried the'matter much Anther An Is warranted by the mere application of this principle: sad under the name of a presumption* have, in effect, rendered the length of enjoyment a direct and substantive title.

[34] held that not only private grants, but rceords, and even Acts of Parliament, may,

be presumed from length of time; and so far as any such presumption is founded upon a real unaffected opinion of the truth so presumed, I subscribe to the justice and propriety of the proceeding. Beyond that, whilst I admit that the maintenance of a long established enjoyment is a very desirable object, I cannot forbear entertaining the opinion, that recent decisions have exceeded the proper limits of judicial authority, and have introduced a principle, which, though it is now perhaps only open to controversy, as a matter of speculation, was not warranted by the fair rules of legal argument.

“ In the ease of the Mayor of Kings ton-upon-Hull against Horner, Cowp. 102, a toll had been received by the corporation for upwards of 300 years, but the corporation itself having been created within the time of legal memory, it was impossible that the title could be founded upon prescription; but it was left to the jury to infer from the usage, whether there had not been a grant of the duties subsequent to the charter of incorporation; and the verdict founded upon the presumption of such a grant was supported by the Court of King's Bench. But soon afterwards. Lord Mansfield, in referring to the authority of that case, advanced a position in favour of the principle which 1 venture to contest. He said, that a grant may be presumed from great length of possession. It was so done in the case of the corporation of Hull against Horner; not that in such cases the court really thinks a grant has been made, because it is not probable that a grant should have existed, without its being upon record; but they presume the fact for the purpose, and from a principle of quieting the possession; *' Cowp. 214. That is, m a case of adverse right, they profess, by way of form, to believe as true, what, in point or fact, they believe to be false, in order that length of time may, by fiction and circuity, produce an effect to which directly and primarily it is inadequate.

[25] “ By statute, any quit-rent which has not been paid for fifty years is extinguished; and there haring been no payment of a quit-rent of half-a-crown for thirty-seven years, that circumstance was left to the jury as 8 ground for presuming an estinguishment or release; but the Court of King's Bench decided, that such a presumption was not warranted‘by the evidence. Lord Mansfield, on that occasion, adverted to the principle, that the statute of limitations is a positive bar from length of time, and operates so conclusively, that although the jury and the court are satisfied that the claim still subsists, yet they are bound by the statute to defeat it: that there arc many cases not within the statute, where, from a principle of quieting the possession, the court has thought that a jury should presume any thing to support a length of possession. He then proceeded to the position from which I have expressed my dissent, and afterwards shewed, from reasoning adapted to the particular case, that there was no ground for inferring an extinguishment. Mr. Justice Aston, in support of the same opinion, observed, that a presumption from length of time to support a right was very different from a presumption to defeat a right; Eldridge ». Knott, Cowp. 214.

[26] “ But the case which seems to have had the most influence in modern determinations, is that of Lewis v. Price, tried before Mr. Justice Wilmot, at Worcester assizes, in the year 1761, in which he said, that where a house had been built forty years, and bas had lights at the end of it, if the owner of the adjoining ground builds against them, so os to obstruct them, an action lies, and this is founded upon the same reason as where they have been immemorial; for this is long enough to induce a presumption, that there was originally some agreement between the parties: and he said, that as twenty years was sufficient to give a title in ejectment, on which he might recover the house itself, he saw no reason why it should not be sufficient to entitle him to any easement belonging to the house; Espinasse's Dig. 636. Afterwards, upon n motion for.a new trial, twenty years' quiet and uninterrupted possession of ancient lights (a) was deemed a sufficient ground, from which a jury might presume a grant; Darwin v. Upton, cited 3 T. R. 159. So far as length of time is merely regarded as a circumstance, upon which a jury may exercise their judgment upon the real fact, I have already admitted the propriety of its influence. But now it has become a matter of daily and established practice to adopt Mr. Justice Wilmot's idea to its full extent, that twenty years'possession gives a title to any easement. It is acted upon as a presumption, juris et de jure, a legal fiction, upon which any argument or discussion is as much excluded as upon an averment of the defendant's being in the custody of the marshal of the Marshalsea, and not as a mere circumstance open to the discussion and consideration of a jury. (1) And it has even been held, that the forbearance to exercise a right for twenty years shall produce an extinction of the right itself, and that all rights incident to land shall be referred to the criterion of twenty years' enjoyment.

[27] “ Having been engaged in opposing the application of that principle, and having in conjunction with some of the most distinguished ornaments of the profession, entertained the idea, that it was a deviation from the regular course of the law, to give the effect of a bar to a

mere presumption, whilst I submit to the contrary adjudication of the court, I cannot, upon the most frequent consideration, adopt the reasoning upon which that adjudication proceeded; and hope I shall not incur the imputation of presumption, by stating the argument by which it was opposed $ fully aware of the influence of that prejudice which results from a professional engagement, and of the deference which is due to judicial authority.

[28] “ I would previously suggest, that the analogy stated by Mr. Justice Wilmot is apparently subject to two objections; 1st. It is an analogy of common law, drawn from the provisions of a particular statute. The statute professedly introduces an alteration in the law, and it is the only authority by which such an alteration can*be properly made. The courts of justice must take the law as they find it, and are not authorized to say, that because the Legislature has made an alteration, which we find to be beneficial in one case, therefore, we will make an alteration in another case, where the same beneficial effects will probably ensue. But, 2d. the principle of the statute of limitations is, that it operates upon an adverse possession, upon one person enjoying property which another was authorised to claim, and the omission of claiming which is a mark of negligence, and therefore should be discouraged; whereas the nse of an easement is not in every instance an usurpation of property; it may not be subject to an action; and whilst the owner of the adjacent property is not injured in his own possession, he has no cause of complaint. But it would be injurious to debar him from the full enjoyment of the rights incident to his own property, such as the building upon his land, because another person had previously built on & contiguous part of the adjoining land, though in doing so, he had not rendered himself liable to any action, but had only been subject to the imputation of folly, .by' placing his windows in a situation where they were liable to be obstructed, (a) Whatever may be fairly ascribed to courtesy or forbearance, ought not hastily to be construed as the exercise of an adverse right; much less should any Act be allowed to have the effects of an adverse possession, where there could be no right of contest, and consequently no imputation of laches.

[29] “ In the case of Prescott and Phillips, which was tried at Chester Spring sssizea, 1797, it appeared, that the persons under whom the defendant claimed, had an ancient mill and weir, which were permitted to fall into decay; and after a period of twenty years, above nineteen years before the commencement of the action, another mill was erected (upon which it may be assumed, ’ for the purpose of the argument, that there was no alteration in the scite or fall, as no reference was made to these circumstances), no act having been done in the mean time by the owners of the adjacent land, advene to the right. The judges at the assizes, and afterwards in the Court of King’s Bench, were of opinion that the cesser or twenty yean in the enjoyment was an extinguishment of the right to the water-course; and, upon that general principle, decided in favour of the plaintiff, treating it as a case which would not even warrant an argument.

* The observations which occurred to the present writer, in support of the position, that it ought not to be presumed that the ancient right was lost or abandoned, were, 1st, That no inconsistent or adverse enjoyment had been acquired; 2d, Because the traces of the ancient right remained at the time of the new erection; 3d, Because so long a period having elapsed since the present erection, without the right being judicially questioned, it ought to be presumed that that was in pursuance of, and connected with, the ancient right. An analogy has been adopted to the Statute of Limitations, in the cases of corporate offices, easements and bonds; but the Statute of Limitations, in cases of ejectment, only operates upon 'acts of adverse possession, not permitting an undisturbed possession and actual enjoyment to be defeated. In cases of corporate offices, the King’s Bench proceeded upon the exercise of a discretionary power, and always in protection of a positive and actual enjoyment. None of the cases embrace the principle, that a right is lost by neglect, there having been no advene enjoyment; and the protection is merely personal and individual. Upon the death of the corporator, the right reverts according to the original constitution.

“ In respect to easements, all the cases are in support of positive acts, as the making windows:there an enjoyment was actually acquired, which the court would not suffer to be defeated. There was a case in Surry, before Lord Mansfield, who laid it down, that an incorporeal right, which, if existing, must be in constant use, ought to be decided by analogy to the Statute of Limitations. Must be in constant use is emphatic. But non constat, that a right must be in constant use, the exercise"of which is attended with expense and risk. The party has not submitted to any actual inconvenience, which he might have avoided by the assertion of his right; he has merely not deemed it necessary to exercise a right, which may or may not be beneficial according to times and circumstances; he has not acquiesced in any Act tending to contradict or invalidate it. If A. buys of B. the coals under a piece of land, and of C. a right of road to

(a) “ If a person places windows contiguous to my land, I must, according to modern practice, put myself to the expense of erecting a building to obstruct them, within the space of twenty yean, which may be attended with detriment and inconvenience to me, or I must be decreed to have made a grant and surrender of the rights which previously belonged to me.

The practical inconvenience of this is perhaps not very great, with respect to buildings recently erected, for the modern decisions are sufficiently notorious, and the requisite precaution is generally taken; but many rights have been lost or prejudiced, for want of knowing, by the spirit of prophecy, that such a system would have been established.’ *

these coal i throughbarren moor, (1) and declines getting the coal* for twenty yean (the place continuing a barren moor), u the grant void or lost ? Here, at the time when the mill was suffered to fall into decay, the right was as great as if an original right to dam up the water had been granted at that time. If, after such grant, the plaintiff had made a weir, and enjoyed it for twenty yean, the grant or light might be presumed to hare been surrendered* That is a case of adverse enjoyment; but merely suffering the river to run in its natural course, is reducing it to the case of a barren moor; and the case of Eldridge and Knott establishes the position, that the mere non-enjoyment of an incorporeal right does not necessarily induce the presumption of its extinguishment. With respect to bonds, a personal demand should, from thtf' nature of it, be recently pursued, and the non-claim of twenty years is a strong presumption of payment; but this is no-wise similar in principle to a right connected with the optional mode of enjoying a real estate.

[303 “ The Cojort of Common Pleas have since decided, in an action brought by the owner of a market at Southall, for erecting another market at Hayes, within three miles, that the erection of pens, and the sale of cattle in them, for twenty years, was a clear bar to the right of action; Holcroft v. Heel, 1 Bos. 400. '

- “ The attempt to found a right upon an enjoyment of twenty years was carried to the most extravagant length, in a case which was brought to trial at Lancaster Sommer Assizes, 1800. A defendant, in justification of a trespass, pleaded that the owners of a messuage had, from time immemorial, 'enjoyed the right of shooting upon the plaintiff's land; and it was intended to be proved, that the defendant and his father had been in the habit of sporting there upwards of twenty years. But the counsel for the defendant did not persist in an attempt which could only bare subjected themselves to equal ridicule with their client.

- [31] “ The present discussion has been composed for several yean, and 1 have ingrafted the substance of it into the view of the decisions of Lord Mansfield; a work in which I have had the mortification to experience a total sacrifice of a considerable portion of assiduity and ex-pence. Since that time, die subject has been before the Court of King’s Bench, in the case of Campbell v. Wilson, 3 East, 294. The defendant had, for upwards of twenty yean, used a way over the plaintiff’s land; the right to which, if it really existed, must, from the circumstance of the case, necessarily have commenced within thirty yean:but there was evidence to shew that the possession was advene: on the other side there were circumstances to shew the probability of the claim having originated in mistake. Mr. Justice Chambre observed to the jury, that it was probable that the enjoyment did originate in the mistake supposed; bat however that might be, if they were satisfied that it was advene, and had continued twenty yean, it was sufficient ground for presuming a grant. Upon a motion for a new trial, Lord Ellenborough observed, that it came to the common case of an adverse possession of a way for twenty yean, without any thing to qualify that advene enjoyment; and there was no reason why toe jury should not, as in other cases, make the presumption, that the defendant acted by right Mr. J. Grose thought that in substance the question was left to the jury, whether the enjoyment originated in a grant, or in any other manner? and therefore, he could not say, but that upon the evidence the jury might not make the presumption which they had done; though had he been one of them, he did not know that he should have dared to do so. Mr. J. Lawrence said, no doubt adverse enjoyment for twenty years, unexplained, is evidence sufficient for the jury to found a presumption that it was a legal enjoyment. Mr. Justice Le Blanc thought that such length of enjoyment was so strong evidence of a right/ that the jury should not be directed to consider small circumstances as founding a presumption that it arose otherwise than by grant. The same learned judge explained the case respecting Hayes market to have only amounted to an intimation, that it would be left to the jury to find for the defendant, upon the ground of presumption of a grant, after twenty years’ uninterrupted use. And Mr. J. Grose said, he assented to that case, as so explained, but no further.

“ In reviewing the preceding opinions, Mr. Justice Grose seems to concuf in the opinion which 1 have endeavoured to maintain—that the presumption in these cases is real matter of inference, upon which the jury are, as in other cases of circumstantial evidence, to exercise a genuine opinion as to the existence or non-existence of the fact in question. But I cannot concur with him in thinking, that such was really the spirit of the directions to the jury in the particular case. The other judges certainly appear to support the fictitious presumption (a)

[(1) In Seaman v. Vawdrey, 16 Vcs. 390. it was held, by the Master of the Rolls, that no presumption occurs from nonuser in case of mines, salt springs, Ac.c.]

(a) “ There are, in truth, two kinds of presumption acted upon in the law, which scarcely agree in any thing but the name: 1st, Inferences of facte really and bona fide made; as where a person, having the recent possession of stolen goods, is presumed to be the thief; 2. Presumptions of form; as where

a satisfied term is presumed to be surrendered, though, in fact, no such thing is believed to have taken place. And to the latter class, the practical application of the presumption in question is certainly to be referred; because in most of the cases, it is impossible to suppose that any person in his senses can believe the fact to be true, which is said to be presumed. Juries are never called upon to balance between the improbability of an enjoyment having subsisted for twenty years, without a legal grant.

that although in point of fact, no logal title dxisted, the idrerae possession of twsaly pm was to be deemed sufficient to constitute such title, and that the Cum supposition of a grant, destroyed by time or accident, was the mode and form in which that right is to be maintained.* *

and the opposite and infinitely greater improbability, if ao gentle a term can be applied to what is absolutely incredible, that within twenty a deed creating a right, or even a grant the crown (an act which must be upon record,) should hare actually been made, and that every trace of its existence should be lost and obliterated. [See the Observations of Lord Erakine, in favour of these presumptions; Hilary ». Walker, 12 Vea. 239.]

“ in fact, courts have departed from their proper province, whenever they have prescribed to a jury the inference which they are to draw from given facts: and twenty years, or any other arbitrary period, can never be the ground of a legitimate inference; which must always depend upon the general combination of circumstances.

“ In the case of Campbell v. Wilson, the Jury were told, that if the enjoyment had been by leave or favour, or otherwise then at a claim or assertion of a right, it would repel the presumption of a grant; but this principle would

destroy the modem doctrine, so far as rtlttas to the enjoyment of lights, as bm already been partfcnlariy shewn.

“ I will not contend that, after the derisions which have taken place, it may not he afire convenient to the public, that the doctrine which has been extensively acted upon in the enjoyment of real estates, should be adhered to than departed from, though of very modern origin. This differs from the cases in which 1 contend for the departure from erroneous precedent, on account of the consequences being merely prospective: but I shall ever retain the sentiment, that the introduction of such a doctrine was a perversion of legal principles, and an unwarrantable assumption of authority. See the cases upon this subject, collected in Mr. Serjeant Williams's Note to Yard t>. Ford, 2 Saund. 175.* [And aee Daniel v.

• A* frequent reference is mede to the nnxnber of the statutes respecting juries, I have thought H desirable to present a general list of their titles $ although most of those which are anterior to the reign of William III. are no longer of any practical importance. In perusing this list, one of the most striking observations is, the number of provisions which occur re' •peering the harsh and absurd proceeding for correcting erroneous verdicts by attaint; and from the attention paid to this procedure by the legislature, it may be reasonably inferred, that the instances of resorting to it were very frequent; and the charges of corruption of juries, and of the sheriffs and other officers entrusted with returning them, are likewise so numerous, that the provisions for repressing those mischiefs were most probably founded upon reasons of imperious necessity. It certainly is one of the most prominent distinctions in favour of later laws, that such charges are very rarely advanced, even by those who are most disappointed by the issue of a trial. Another prominent subject of the statutes was the regulation of is* sues levied upon the jurors, a measure which is now become entirely obsolete, although the ancient form of the return, to the writ of distringas is still continued. The attendance of juries upon trials at bar and other proceedings must, in its nature, have been very onerous; and perhaps few alterations of the law have been more beneficial than those for directing the return of a general panel, and for the regulation of special juries. But complaints are made, apparently not quite without foundation, of the existing mode of selecting special juries in the Metropolis, by forming lists of persons to whom the attendance is an object in point of pecuniary emolument, rather than by summoning, as is the usual course upon trials in the country, gentlemen who are regarded as holding a superior station in point of respectability. In this observation I am very far from intimating an assent to the charges of partiality made against special juries, as contrasted with common ones, upon questions of political feeling. I think it unfortunate that compulsory powers for enforcing the attendance of special jurors in the country are in general neglected, and that their appearance ia considered entirely optional:and dance of at the trials in London

and WL, ___it been the occasion of the practice which ia at present generally

complained of.

The ancient functions of juries were very different ones from the modern one of finding a verdict according to the evidence. The following view of the subject in the reign of Edward I. taken from'Mr. Reeves’s History of the Law, Vol. II. p. 271., is very striking and important. In this, as in most other respects, the advantage of the modern course of jurisprudence, as applied to an advanced state of society, is very considerable:

“ It was many yean after this reign, and when the second (since called the petty) jury began to be considered rather as judges of the presumption raised by the finding of the presentora, and not aa witnesses of the fact, that a kind of evidence used to be exhibited to them. The first evidence made use of in this way consisted of written papers; such as depositions, informations, and examinations, taken out of court: this led by degrees to a sparing use of viva voce testimony. It was long before they thought it necessary to bring evidence into court in support of the prosecution, and it was still longer before they allowed the prisoner to disprove the indictment by any thing else than the oaths of the twelve ivrati. When a prisoner was permitted to cad witnesses to prove such matter as he offered in his defence, it was a high favour; and depended much on the discretion of the court, and the manner in which the charge had been made out by the prosecutors: besides this the witnesses for the prisoner were never upon oath; which always left a pretence for discrediting their testimony.

* The trial by jury at the tunc of which we are now writing, was, to all intents and purposes, a trial by witnesses; and, no doubt, deserved all the value that was set on it by our ancestors. When the condition of society so changed, that, notwithstanding all the supposition of their personal knowledge of the fact, as coming from the vicinage, they were in reality wholly ignorant of it: and it was necessary the charge should be proved to* them, before titey could pronounce on the guilt or innocence of the party; then the old proceeding became a piece of mummery, productive of oppression and tyranny, till at length it was softened by the calling of witnesses to inform the conscience of the twelve jurors. This was the last improvement of the trial by jury in criminal cases, and it was not thoroughly effected till the times of Edward VI. and Queen Mary.’ *

* allowed and taken instead of an oath, in any case wherein by any Act or Acts of Parliament an oath is required, unless the said affirmation

* or declaration be by such Act or Acts of Parliament, particularly and expressly directed to be allowed and taken instead of such oath; by reason of which doubt the testimony of the said people called Quakers

(1) Sections IV. and V. relate to the recovery of tithes. See Part II. Class II. No. VIII.

(2) The affirmation of Quakers may be received as evidence in penal actions; Atchcson v. Everett, Cowp. 382.: so on motions for an attachment for non-performance of awards, which is regarded as a civil remedy; Taylor v. Scott, and other cases cited ibid.: in an affidavit in defence of the party himself, upon an application for an information; Rex r. Shack-lington, Andr. 201, n.; Rex v. Gardener, 2 Bur. 1117: on a rule on the crown side of B. R. respecting an appointment of overseers; Rex v. Turner, 2 Str. 1219.

Bun-bridge, Cowp. 392.

About the year 1798 a bill was brought into Parliament by the late Serjeant Adair, who had been Recorder of London, to admit the naation of Quakers in criminal cases, which,

as far as my recollection serves, passed the House of Commons, but was thrown out in the-House of Lords, upon the opposition of Lord. Kenyon. Considering that testimony given, upon affirmation is subject to all the penal consequences of perjury, 1 think it would be very desirable to remove the exceptions as to criminal cases; for with respect to the moral and religious obligation, few persons who would venture to assert a falsehood in a court of justice would hesitate upon the religious scruple of taking an oath; and the exception rather operates in exclusion of the truth, which might be otherwise manifested on behalf of the public or the party accused, than as a bar to the reception of a falsehood.

(3) Inis Act only prescribes forms of affirmations, instead of the oaths to Government, and enacts (sect. 3.) that the provisions 7 and 8 William III. c. 34. shall, except so far aa thereby repealed, continue of the same force as before.

It is sometimes contended, that as persons convicted of grand larceny, and having received judgment, are not competent witnesses until after the punishment is complete, the same rule must, by analogy, be applied in the construction of this Act to persons convicted of petty larceny; but the express language of the Act itself, declaring that no person by reason of conviction for petty larceny shall be incompetent, will clearly not admit of that construction. I have indeed heard it argued, that as the Act only speaks of conviction for petty larceny, it does not apply to the case of judgment: but as a conviction without judgment never amounted to a disqualification, the Act, according to that construction, would be nugatory; for it does not provide for the restoration of the competence of witnesses once disqualified, bat enacts generally that the disqualification shall not take place.

In Pilfold's case, 10 Co. 116. it was laid down, that in actions where a man, either before or by the statute of Gloucester, should not recover damages, if afterwards another statute in a new case give damages, then the plaintiff (unless costs arc expressly given by such later statute) should not recover costs. And this rule was assented to by three of the judges of the Common Pleas, rWilles J. contra) Witham v. Hill, 2 Weis. 91. Barnes, 151. According to Lord Kenyon's note of this case, cited in Creswell v. Houghton, 6 T. R. 355. Willes said—441 agree that when a statute subsequent to the statute of Gloucester gives an action where no damages were sustained before, the plaintiff is not entitled to costsj but in all cases where a party

sustains a damage, and a subsequent statute

fives the remedy, the party is entitled to costa." n the case of Witham «. Hill, it was ruled, that the plaintiff was entitled to costs in an action against the hundred on the Riot Act, 1 Geo. I. st. 2. c. 5. (the judges who admitted the authority of Pilfold's case thinking, that the particular case fell within the rale, as damages might have been before recovered against the particular trespassers). In Gunthorn v. The hundred of Thicale, 3 Bur. 1723. it was incidentally held, that the plaintiff was entitled to costs in an action against the hundred for maliciously setting fire to a barn, (which being previously a felony, does not admit of the distinction last mentioned). Some doubts were thrown upon the authority of that case, in Wilkinson v. Abbot, Cowp. 367; but the doctrine was established in Wilkinson v. The hundred of Calesworth, 1 T. R. 71. Costs are allowed on the statute of Hne and Cry; Penkney v. Inhabitants of East Hundred, 2 Saund. 379. In Creswell v. Houghton, 6T. R. 355. it was ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to costs in an action on 23 Henry VI. c. 9. against the sheriff, for refusing to take hail, on the ground that the plaintiff might have recovered damages before the statute of Gloucester, provided he took the proper means to compel the sheriff to accept bail; namely, by suing out a writ of mainprise.

That if any person or persons, at any time after the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, in the twenty-third year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord King Henry the Kighth, commence or sue in any court of record, or elsewhere in any other court, any action, bill, or plaint, of trespass upon the statute of King Richard the Second, made in the fifth year of his reign, for entries into lands and tenements, where none entry is given by the law, or any action, bill, or plaint of debt or covenant, upon any especially made to the plaintiff 6r plaintiffs, or upon any contract supposed (I)

observes, that in those the party had no right of action before the statute of Gloucester: Quart imptdit was considered as a mere spiritual concern; so tithes could not be recovered in the imperial courts before the reign of Edward VI. In Warder. Snell, 1 H. B. 10. it was ruled that the plaintiff waa entitled to costa in an action on the Habeaa Corpus Act, 31 Ch.

Werring, Willes, 440. There are no costs upon an action at the suit of a common informer, who is not a party grieved, unless expressly given; see Shore v. Mavisten, 1 Salk. 206. Nor in a traverse of an inquisition; Rex v. Inhabitants of Glastonbury, 2 Str. 1069. Where a statute gives double or treble damages, the costs are also doubled or trebled; Hullock.

(1) It is well known that persons suing as executors or administrators are not liable to costs; the reason generally assigned for which is, that they may be ignorant of the true circumstances of the case; but in Tattersall v. Groote, 2 B. and P. 253, Lord Eldon says, “ that the doctrine seems to be founded on this Act, of which all the cases are an exposition. Attending to the language of the Act, perhaps we may be authorized to say, that the

sound principle on which the exemption of executors and administrators rests, is not the degree of ignorance under which they may be supposed to lie, but that the exemption founds itself on the description of the words contained in the statute on which costs are to be paid: the words are—* Any action, 6lc. upon any especially made to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, or upon any contract supposed to be made between the plaintiff, Ac.c.' The statute of Jar. L does not carry the matter further: the subsequent allusion is to any offence or wrong personal, immediately supposed, Ac.c.' ”

Any general statutes giving costs to defend: ants are held not to apply to actions brought by executors, as was ruled with respect to s plea of bankruptcy, on 5 Geo. II. c. 30. § 7. in Martin v. Norfolk, 1 H. B. 528.

The exemption is of very great hardship in its principle and operation: however free from censure an executor or other person may be who brings an action under a mistaken view of the circumstances of the case, there is no reason for subjecting the other party, who is equally free from censure, to the expense arising from such mistake; and there would be nothing inequitable in requiring those on whose behalf the experiment is to be made, to include the indemnity of a defendant from costa to which he is wrongfully subjected in the calculation of success or failure, in point of fact, great extortion is frequently committed, by bringing unfounded or experimental actions, in the expectation of submission to su unjust or questionable demand being preferred to a successful but expensive resistance.

The cases respecting an executor's liability to or exemption from costs are very numerous, and are fully collected in Mr. Hullock's Treatise, chap. lit. s. 1.

The general conclusion from all the cases is, that the^xemption depends upon the question whether the plaintiff was obliged to sue as executor or not; and that if he could sue is propria jure, he is not protected from payment of costs by naming himself executor.

In several cases it is laid down, that the rule depends upon the question whether the money recovered would be assets; but that doctrine is contrary to the entire current of modern authorities, as is evident from the cases where an executor is subjected to costs on account of trover in the testator's life-time, and conversion after his death; as to which see Bolland v. Spencer, 7 T. R. 358; Hobbes v. Smith, 10 E. 293. So if an executor sue as such for money received by the defendant since the testator's death, for his use, as executor; Goldthw&ite v. Petrie, 5 T. R. 234. In the marginal abstract of the modern case of Thompson v. Slent, 1 Taunt. 322. it is stated, that if the money recovered would be assets, the executor, suing as such, is not liable to costs; but there is nothing in the decision itself to warrant that representation. The case arose on a special demurrer for a misjoinder of counts on promises to the testator in his life-time, and an inrimul comput assent with the plaintiff, and his wife, as executrix. The question of costs being incidentally mentioned, the court referred to Eaves v. Mocato, as cited in Jenkins v. Plume, 1 Salk. 207. in which it was held that, upon an insimui comput assent with an executor, the defendant was not entitled to costs, because the promise begot no new cause of action, but only ascertained the old. They also referred to Ball e. Palmer, T. Jon. 47. upon a similar count, when It was determined, (as was formerly held) that as the money, if recovered, would be assets, no costs were payable. But this incidental refe- -rence to a doctrine opposed by so many modern decisions, and which was in no respect necessary to the decision of the case, cannot be regarded as an authority of any consequence.

There are different cases in which it is settled, that an executor is not liable to costs in an action for breach, in his own time, of a covenant with or promise to the testator; Tattersall v. Groote, 2 B. and P. 253; Cooke v. Lucas, 2 E. 395; which cases fall within the established principle, that the plaintiff must necessarily name himself executor. The cases on counts of inrimul computassent are referable to the same principle; for it is clear, that upon a general count of that description, as founded upon an account between the plaintiff and defendant, thp former could not recover upon an acknowledgment of money due to his testator.

In Cockerill v. Kynaston, 4 T. R. 277. it is reported to have been .decided, that if an executor declare on a trover and conversion in the testator's life-time, and also on a trover and conversion after his death, the evidence offered being only applicable to the first count, and he be nonsuited, he is not liable to pay costs. Bat in the subsequent case of Bolland a. Spencer, 7 T. R. 358. Lord Kenyon said that there

must be some mistake in the case. He said— “ The rule in favour of executors is already sufficiently extensive. We all of us remember a variety of actions improperly brought by them, and which would not, perhaps, have been brought, had it not been for the privilege which they have of being exempt from paying costs." Clearly nothing could be less satisfactory than the supposed decision in Cockerill v. Kynaston. If a party gives no evidence, he is nonsuited generally; and it would be the height of absurdity if he could exempt himself from the consequences of such nonsuit by giving evidence which amounted to nothing, in support of particular counts: and referring to Gnmstead v. Shirley, 2 Taunt. 116, 1 find it said by Lawrence J.—“ How can it depend on the facts which appear at the trial ? Suppose the cause is called on, and no evidence is given, but the plaintiff, instead of appearing, submits to a nonsuit, we cannot see what the facta were. The plaintiff must take care to have his verdict on the right count; and then if the count gives costs where it ought not, it is error, but the court can only look at the record." The decision in Griinstead v. Shirley is upon the old case of two counts in trover, one stating a conversion before and the other after the death of the testator, and upon nonsuit costs given against the plaintiff. The marginal abstract, that where a plaintiff executor adds one count as executor, stating a cause of action for which he might declare in his own right, if he is nonsuited, he shall be liable to costs, though not stated in those general terms in the body of the esse, is evidently the fair result of all the authorities upon the subject.

An executor is entitled to exemption, although suing for the benefit of others, who would equally be entitled to maintain the action in their own name:for instance, the executor of a person who effected a policy of insurance, suing on behalf of the persona for whose benefit it was effected; Wilton tr. Hamilton, 1 B. and P. 445. But where an executor lent his name to other persons, under circumstances which were held to be an abuse of the practice of the court, the court of C. B. made an order upon him for payment of costs: the costs were not made part of the judgment, which would have been error on the record; Comber v. Hard castle, 3 B. and P. 115.—The following note was subjoined to the case of Eaves v. Mocato, in the sixth edition of Sal-keld, Vol.l. p. 314. respecting the cases where an executor is or is not liable to costs upon interlocutory proceedings. In Eaves Mocato it was said by the court, that if an executor will not go on to trial according to his notice, he shall pay the costs of suit.

“ An executor or administrator shall pay costs if he be guilty of any laches or delay in

from the judge. The first instance of such certificate was in White r. Smith, 17 Geo. II. cited 2 Str. 1232.; I Wils. 94. In that case the action was for taking away sand on Hounslow Heath, and Willes C. J. having certified that the damages found (being under 40#.) were the real damages to be recovered, it was ruled to be a case within the Act, and not within the exception of actions for any title or interest in land. The Act extends to an action for disturbing a way or common, which may be against a mere wrong doer, without any question of right; Edmondson ». Edmondson, 8 E. 294.; Kylcman v.

The Act also extends to trespass for assaulting the plaintiff, stopping his waggon, and taking away his cart rope; the defondant haring justified taking the rope for toll, after demand and refusal, and the issue being on the demand and refusal; Walker v. Robinson, 1 Wils. 93;

This Act would seem in its purview to be must arise where the injury complained of is of a sufficiently general to comprehend actions of mixed nature; or distinct injuries are com-every description, and not to be confined to plained of in the same declaration, on some of the particular actions of assault and battery, which such certificate can be granted, and on and trespass quart clausum fregit, upon which, others not. The material distinction seems to in particular cases, certificates to entitle the be, that where the complaint that would alone plaintiff to full costs, are authorized by a sub- carry costs, is a material and substantial part sequent part of the clause. And as a matter of of the case, and upon establishment of which reasoning, it is very difficult to admit that the the pUiptiff is entitled to a verdict, he is not

operation of a general provision shall be restrained, because an exception is introduced which can only apply to some particular part of the subject within the scope of such provision. The propriety of such a restrictive con^ •traction is jointly questioned by Willcs, C. J. in Milburnc v. Read, 3 Wils. 325; and in the works of Sergeant Hullock:but the opposite doctrine has been long completely established. The doctrine, that where there is a special plea of justification the plaintiff shall be entitled to full costs without certificate, however firmly settled, seems also to be contrary to the intention and true construction of the Act; as even in the excepted cases the action itself may be very frivolous, and the most effectual way of preventing suits of that description, is to subject the costs to the discretion of the judge. In cases of assault, a person who has a reasonable probability of establishing a justification is prevented from making the attempt by the hazard of liability to full costs in case of failure; and I apprehend, that it would not be beneath the attention of the Legislature to

rvide that full costa should not be allowed actions of assault and battery without a judge's certificate, notwithstanding any special plea of justification.

The following note as to the actions in which the statute is or is not applied, was subjoined by the editor to the case of Yen v. Phillips,

1 Salk. 207, in which it was ruled, that the plaintiff was entitled to full costs in an action for taking, driving and wounding sheep.—The additions are, as in other instances of quotations from the Editor's former publications, denoted by brackets.

“ According to the construction which has, by an uniform train of decisions, been applied to the statute 22 and 23 Cha. 11. c. 9. the doctrine of this case (viq. that the plaintiff is by that statute deprived of full costs where the damages recovered are under 40a, in those actions only wherein a certificate of an actual battery, or the title of the land coming in question, can be given) is fully established.

excluded from full costs by its being joined with a complaint for an assault or trespass. But where it is only a collateral circumstance, a matter of aggravation or a mode of committing the other injury, the costs will be no more than the damages. Thus, full costs are given in an action for breaking the plaintiff's close, and impounding his cattle; Barnes v. Edgard, 3 Mod. 39. So where one count was for a trespass on land, and another for carrying away a hog; Knightly v. Buxton, Sayer on Costs, 39: for a trespass in a house, and consuming victuals; Smith v. Clarke, 2 Str. 1130:for entering the plaintiff’s close and cutting his cable, whereby the plaintiff lost the use of his boat. Haines r. Hughes, Comb. 324:entering his close, and driving his sheep or bull; Arnold v. Thompson, Barnes, 119; Thompson v. Berry,

1 Str. 551:bringing diseased cattle into the plaintiff's close, whereby the plaintiff's cattle were infected; Anderson r. Buckton, 1 Str. 192: in trespass and assault for criminal conversation; Batchelor v. Bigg, 2 Bl. 854; 3 Wilt. 319: Assault and false imprisonment / 1 Bar. Ab. 515; [for beating a servant per quod servitium amisit; Peak v 3 Kcb. 184]:

assault and battery, and treading upon and spoiling the plaintiff's coals, and spoiling his standard and roller; Milbourne v. Read, Barnes, 134, cited 3 Wils. 322. Where a double injury is charged, as in the preceding cases, the jury may find for the plaintiff as to the assault or trespass, and for the defendant as to the other cause of action, in which cases there are no more costs than damages; Gilb. Eq. Rep. 199; 1 Bac. Ab. 514; in marg. Hullock, 84, note; Beck v. Nichols, 1 Str. 577; Cotterill r. Jolly. 1 T. R. 655:or where there is no evidence of such other cause, a general verdict will be amended by the judge's notes; Back and Hullock ubi supra. In the following cases it has been held that the plaintiff is not entitled to full costs:assaulting the plaintiff and disturbing him in his quiet possession, Ac.c.; Boiture v. Woolrick, 1 Ld.

Milher, 1 Str. 645:[throwing stones against the plaintiff’s windows, and breaking the glass: Adlem r. Grinaway, 6. T. R. 281:pulling down, burning and consuming by fire the plaintiff’s fence, there being a justification found for the defendant as to the pulling down; Stead v. Gamble, 7 E. 325 :] breaking the house, making a noise and continuing in it until the plaintiff was obliged to give the defendant a promissory note; Appleton r. Smith, 3 Bur. 1282:[in an action for mesne profits; Doc v. Davies, 6T.R. 593.] The asportation of personal property entitles the plaintiff to full costs, though complained of in the same declaration as a trespass; but no more costs than damages were allowed for digging peat, &c. and carrying away the same, the asportation being only a mode and qualification of the injury to the land; Clegg v. Molineux, Dong. 780. Many cases have arisen where the plaintiff complained of an assault on his person, and also an injury to his clothes; but it seems now to be fully settled, that where the injury to the clothes is a consequence of the assault, or part of the same transaction, it will not entitle the plaintiff to more costs than damages; Mears v. Greenaway, 1 Hen. BL 295; [R. accordingly, although the tearing of the clothes was charged as a substantive fact; Lockwood v. Stannard, 6 T. R. 482.] The doctrine upon this subject is very clearly stated in the case of Batchelor v. Bigg, 3 Wils. 319:vide also Mr. Hullock’s Treatise on the Law of Costs, where the subject is folly and ably considered, and from which the foregoing cases have been extracted.

“ It should be observed, that in those cases where the plaintiff is not deprived of foil costs by the stat. of Chaa. II. his right to them may be prevented by a judge’s certificate under 43 EHz. c. 6.”

(1) If the defendant pleads a justification of son assault demesne to the assault and battery, a certificate is unnecessary; 2 Keb. 849; Richards r. Turner, B. N. P. 330:so in case of a justification molliter manus imposuit to turn the plaintiff out of a garden; Washer v. Smith,

Edge, 6 T. R. 562. Secus, if the justification is to the assault only, independently of the battery; Page v. Creed,

3 T. R. 391; Brennan v. Redmond, 1 Taunt.

(2) No certificate is requisite where it appears by the pleadings that the title was m question; as upon plea of right way and replication, extra viam; Asser r. Finch, 2 Lev. 234. and other cases cited Hullock; Martin v. Val-lance, 1 E. 350. Secus, where the right of way was pleaded by Metes and Bounds; Cockerill v. Allan son, B. R. 22 G. III. [Hullock, 76). The defendant pleaded two pleas of justification; the plaintiff replied, by way of new assignment, that the trespasses were committed on other days, and on other occasions, and recovered a verdict under 40s. Ruled, that he was entitled to the costs of all the pleadings; Gundry v. Sturt, 1 T. R. 636. In Hudson r. Browne, Barnes, 124, Lloyd v. Day, id. 149, the defendant having pleaded a justification, and the plaintiff new assignment, and recovered under 40#., it was ruled that he waa entitled to no more costa than damages. In the first case the court said, “ Here is no special pleading; the new assignment is only to ascertain the plea." In the second, that “the plea of not guilty, being to the new assignment, makes no difference.’’ I cannot discover on what ground Gundry v. Sturt was decided, except the intimation of the master, that it had been the practice to allow costs in such cases; or why a defendant, who had committed two trespasses, one qualified and justifiable, the other not so, should be subject to greater liability for the latter, than if the former had not taken place. And in Gregory v. Ormerod, 4 Taunt. 98. of which I was not aware at the time of making the preceding observation, it was held, conformably to the authority of Cockerill v. Allanson, that when the defendant justified under a JL fa., and the plaintiff now assigned other trespasses committed after the return, he was not entitled to more costs than damages; and Mansfield C. J. said, “ It is a monstrous thing that where a plaintiff has been wholly in the wrong in bringing an action for a trespass, which is fully

aualified by a right of wav, or other right, he lerefore shall have full costs, because he brings another action for another little trifling trespass, which he may happen to be able to prove.”.

In Redridge r. Palmer, 2 H. B. 2, the defendant pleaded a licence, and the plaintiff having obtained a verdict for Is., the court held that he was entitled to foil coats, upon the ground that the rule which had long prevailed in both courts, that when there was a special plea of justification the plaintiff was entitled to full costs, ought not to be disturbed. So in Comer v. Baker, 2 H. B. 341, where the defendant pleaded, 1. the general issue; 2. disclaimer of title, and tender of amends; 3. distress, damage feasant, for the same trespass; 4. escape of cattle for defect of fences; 5. licence. The Court said, that if it had been a new case, they should have 2

damages to be under the value of forty shillings, shall not recover or obtain more costs of suit than the damages so found shall amount unto: And if any more costs in any such action shall be awarded, the judgment shall be void, and the defendant is hereby acquitted of and from the same, and may have his action against the plaintiff for <such vexatious suit, and recover his damages and costs or such his suit in any of the said courts of record.

Where several persons arc defendants to any action, Ac.c.

thought that the argument of the defendant on the construction of the statute ought to be adopted. But that as a different practice had prevailed, and was confirmed by Redridge v. Palmer, which was decided upon great consideration, they did not think it right to depart from it. This is clearly one of the cases in which a practice admitted to be erroneous might have been corrected without inconvenience. But the same point was decided upon a plea of licence, in Paddle v. Kiddle, 7 T. R. 659. Lord Kenyon, referring to the preceding cases, says, “The principle on which those determinations were founded is, that when the case is such, that the judge who tries it cannot, in any view of it, grant a certificate within the act, it is decided to be a case out of the statute. Here was a plea of licence, upon which the question could not arise, whether or not the defendant had a title to the land; the question was, whether or not he had liberty to go over the land; therefore the case was not within the statute.” He further adverted to its being a dangerous innovation to disturb such a settled point. It would, I apprehend, be very difficult to find any thing more unsatisfactory, in point of reasoning, than the ground of decision which has been jnst cited. The statute restrains the allowance of costs, unless the judge certifies that the title did come in question. The courts say, that the exception confines the rule to Actions, wherein the title could come in question. It is further settled, that the certificate shall not be required, where, by the pleading, it appears that the title did come in question;

and this is followed up by the doctrine that in actions where the title might come in question, and therefore within the purview of the Act, an exception intended to protect cases where the ^itle actually did come in question, shall be further extended by construction, upon the especial ground, that, according to the matter pleaded, by no possibility it could come in question.

It was formerly held, that no certificate was necessary, where there had been a view before trial: but since the Slat. 4XXAnne, c. 16, the practice has been to grant a view of course, and full costs are not allowed on account of such view, although granted-at fhe instance of the defendant; Flint v. Hill, 11 E. 184. Possibly, the very object of requiring the view, may be to shew the insignificance of the damage sustained. Where a cause is referred to arbitration, and by the rule of reference the costs are to abide the event, the finding of the arbitrator is not equivalent to a certificate of the judge.

Seagrare, Cas. of Prac. in C. B. 25. So in murre impedit; Thrale r. Bishop of London, 1 H. B. 530. Upon pleas of the general issue and statute of limitations, the plaintiff took issue on the first, and demurred to the second; the issue was found for the plaintiff, and afterwards the demurrer adjudged for the defendant. Ruled, that the defendant should hAvc costs on the demurrer, and no costs be allowed on the issue; Cooke v. Sager, 2 Burr. 713. It had been previously holden in the Common Pleas, (Yates v. Green, Barnes, 141.) that in such case the plaintiff should have the costs of the issue, and the lesser costsvbe deducted from the greater; Yates e. Green, Barnes, 141. Upon a declaration of two counts, demurrer to one found for the defendant, and issue on the other, found for the plaintiff; ruled, that the defendant should not have costs of the demurrer; Ast-ley v. Young, 2 Burr. 1233; which was admitted to be a settled law in Postan r. Stanway, 5 E. 161. By the several authorities cited in that case, it appears that a plaintiff, who has a clear and an experimental right of action against the same defendant, has a great advantage in suing on the latter without risk of costs.

(2) Before this statute, costs in error were only given in favour of the plaintiff in the original suit. An executor plaintiff in the original action is not liable to costs in error; Gale r. Till, Carth. 281; Comb. 228; 3 Lev. 375; String. 400. See observations in the different

reports of this case, Hullock, ch. 4. sec. 2. For costs in error generally, see Title Error> post.

(3) Damages were recoverable at common law in waste against tenant by the curtesy or in dower, and the Statute of Gloucester giving: treble damages, the plaintiff is in such case entitled to treble costa; but as no damages could be recovered against tenant for life or years before the statute of Gloucester, they were only rendered liable to costs by this Act; Hullock, c. 4. s. 3.

(4) Costs are not allowed under this Act upon judgment by default; Biddulph v. Cooper, cited 1 H. B. 108:nor upon counts for treble value, when after a demurrer the cause was referred to an arbitrator, who found the single value under twenty nobles; but in that case costs were allowed on the count for single value; Barnard r. Moss, 1 H. B. 107.

(5) Sec Hullock, ch. 4. s. 5.—This only extends to scire facias in civil suits, not to sene facias to repeal a patent; Rex tr. Milos, 7 T. R. 367:in Ilucr v, Whitebread, Gas. Prac. C. B. 74; Pool v. Broadfield, Barnes, 431; it was held that costs could not be given against a plaintiff applying to quash his own scire facias t and it was ruled accordingly in Parklington r. Peck, 1 Stra. 638, on the plaintiff applying for leave for that purpose after plea in abatement; but the Court said, if there had been no plea, that they would have made the plaintiff pay the costs. An executor suing or sued in scire facias is exempt from costs by sect. 5.; Bcllew v. Aylmer, I Stra. 188.

(6) See Hullock, ch. 4. s. 6.—For costs in prohibition, under stat. 2 & 3 Edw. VI. c. 13, see that statute supra, Part 1. Class II. No. XVI. It is settled by several cases cited in Hullock, ubi supra, that a plaintiff having judgment in prohibition, is. entitled to costs from the first suggestion. But a defendant in

And for the preventing of wilful and malicious trespasses, be it If defendant jrther enacted, That in all actions of trespass to be commenced or be found rosecuted, from and after the said five ana twentieth day of March, guilty, plain* >ne thousand six hundred ninety and seven, in aqy of hts Majesty’s tiff to have Joints of Record at Westminster, wherein at the trial (3) of the cause it COIt8»&c* hall appear and be certified by the judge, under his hand, upon the

ack of the record, that the trespass upon which any defendant shall be Mind guilty was wilful and malicious, the plaintiff shall recover, not nly his damages but his full costs of suit; any former law to the con-rary notwithstanding (4).

V. Provided always, That nothing herein contained shall be construed Law against o alter the laws in being as to executors or administrators, (5) in such executors not ases where they are not at present liable to the payment of costs of suit, to be altered.

[For the remainder of the Act see the next Gass.]

ase of a nonsuit, is not entitled to costs of opposing the rule of a prohibition; Carlisle v. Meyrick, Sayer on Costs, 137. If upon demurrer to a declaration on prohibition, a prohibition be awarded upon some points and not on others, the plaintiff is entitled to costs; Middleton tr. Croft, 2 Stra. 1062; Andrew, 62. A defendant is entitled to costs if part only of the issue is found for him, whereupon a consultation is awarded; Malton v, Acklam, Barnes, 138; Brymer v. Atkins, Tidd, 851. If the jury find a modus different from that alleged by the plaintiff, the defendant is entitled to costs j Brock v. Richardson, 1 T. R. 427.

(1) There are no costs under this provision in case of judgment by default, but if the

J plaintiff have damages on the writ of enquiiy or the contempt, in proceeding after the delivery of the writ of prohibition, he may have costs under the statute of Gloucester; see Bet-tinson v. Hinchman, Cas. Pr. C. B. 20; Bet-tinson v. Savage (come Semhle . C.) Com. Rep. 335. Costs were given against the defendant where be had forced the plaintiff to declare, and afterwards pleaded a frivolous plea; Seed v. Woolfenden, 20aroes, 148. But the defendant may waive the right of requiring the plaintiff to declare in prohibition, and in that case proceedings are stayed without costs; Gregge v. Jones, 2 Stra. 1148. There are no costs against executors either as plaintifft or defendants in prohibition:see sect. 5, infra; Scummull v. Wilkinson, 9 E. 202.

(2} The statute omits the case of costs to the aefeodant upon demurrer.

(3) In Ford v. Parr, 2Wils. 21, the judge having certified out of Court, the Court said that the certificate was void and contrary to

the statute, which enacts that it shall be made iu open court at the trial. But in Harper v. Carr, 7 T. R 448, it is said to have been de? termined in a preceding case of Swinnerton v. Jervis, (mentioned 6 T. R. 12, n. but on a different trial,) that the certificate might be out of court.

(4) lu 3 Bla. Com. 214, it is said that every trespass is wilful where the defendant has notice, and especially forewarned not to come in the land, as every trespass is malicious where the intent of the defendant appears plainly to harass and distress the plaintiff. Bat no authority is cited, and perhaps the learned Commentator, as to wilful trespass, intended rather to state a general rule than a universal position. In Reynolds v. Edwards, 6 T. R. 11, it was held on the authority of a preceding case of Swinnerton v. Jervis, that the judge was bound to certify in case of trespass after notice, although it appeared in Reynolds v. Edwards that the defendant did not know that the land was that of the plaintiff, and wished to avoid trespassing contrary to a general notice which had been given. But in Gorst v, Watkins, 3 E. 495, upon a rule to show cause why the judge should not certify, the Court held that the rule was improper, and that the judge had a discretion. It seems also in this case to be the opinion of the Court that there should he some evidence of agency in the person by whom the notice is immediately given. But I should apprehend that this was in the breast of the judge, and that be is not bound to confine bis conclusion of the act being wilful, to a particular evidence of its being so.

[No. I.] Statutum de Mercatoribus, the Statute of Acton-Burnel, made anno 11 Edward I. and Anno Dom. 1283. Ordaining the Statute-Merchant for recovery of debts.

“ "ElORASMUCHas merchants, which heretofore have lent their goods 44 JT to divers persons, be greatly impoverished because there is no speedy law provided for them to have recovery of their debts at the day “ of payment assigned; and by reason hereof many merchants have Withdrawn to come into this realm with their merchandizes, to the “ damage as well of the merchants as of the whole realm4 the King by himself and by his council hath ordained and established that the merchant which will be sure of his debt shall cause his debtor to come before the Mayor of London, or of York, or Bristol, or before the Mayor and 4 a clerk (which the King shall appoint for the same) for to knowledge the debt and the day ofnayment; and the recognizance shall be entered into a roll with the hand of the said clerk, which shall be known. Moreover, the said clerk shall make with his own hand a bill obligatory, 4 whereunto the seal of the debtor shall be put, with the King’s seal that shall be provided for the same purpose, the which seal shall remain in the keeping of the mayor and clerk aforesaid:And if the debtor doth not pay at the day to him limited, the creditor may come before the said mayor and clerk with his bill obligatory; and if it be found by the roll and by the bill that the debt was knowledged, and that the day of payment is expired, the mayor shall incontinent cause the moveables of the debtor to be sold, as far as the debt doth amount, by the praising of honest men, as chattels, burgages deviseable, until the whole sum of the debt; and the money, without delay, shall be paid to the creditor.

4 And if the mayor can find no buyer, he shall cause the moveables to be delivered to the creditor at a reasonable price, as much as doth amount to the sum of the debt, in allowance of his debt; and the King’s 4 seal shall be put unto the sale and deliverance of the burgages devise- able for a perpetual witness. And if the debtor have no moveables within the jurisdiction of the mayor, whereupon the debt may be levied,

4 but hath some other-where within the realm, then shall the mayor send the recognizance made before him and the clerk aforesaid unto the Chancellor, under the King's seal; and the Chancellor shall direct a 4 writ unto the sheriff in whose bailiwick the moveables of the debtor be,

4 and the sheriff shall cause him to agree with his creditor in such form as the mayor should have done in case that the moveables of the debtor had been within his power. And let them that shall praise the moveable goods, to be delivered unto the creditor, take good heed that they do set a reasonable price upon them; and if they do set an over high price for favour borne to the debtor, and to the damage of the creditor, then shall the thing so praised be delivered unto themselves at such price as they have fiiniied, and they shall be forthwith answerable unto the creditor for his debt. And it the debtor will say that his moveable goods were delivered or sold for less than they were worth

4 yet shall he have no remedy thereby; for when the mayor or the she* jj0> j#

4 be may account it his own folly that he did not sell his own moveable 11 “y* 4 goods himself before the day of bis suit (when he might, and would not) and have levied the money with his own hands. And if the debtor have no moveables whereupon the debt may be levied, then shall his The debtor im- body be taken where it may be found, and kept in prison, until that prisoned.

4 long time as he tarrieth about the suit of his debt, and until the moveable goods of the debtor be sold or delivered unto him. And if the The creditors creditor do not take the debtor alone for the sorety of his payment, pledges.

4 by reason whereof pledges or mainpernors be founden, then those pledges or mainpernors shall come before the mayor and clerk above- said, and shall* bind themselves by writings and recognizances, as afore is said of the debtor. And in like manner if the debt be not paid at the day limited, such execution shall be awarded against the pledges or mainpernors, as before is said of the debtor.

Provided nevertheless, That so long as the debt may be fully taken and levied of the goods moveable of the debtor, the mainpernors or pledges shall be without damage:Notwithstanding for default of moveable goods of the debtor, the creditor shall have execution of bis recognizance upon the mainpernors or pledges, in such manner and form as before is limited against the principal debtor/

the eleventh year of his reign, ordained establishments thereupon fot the remedy of such merchants; which ordinances and establishments,

the King commanded that they shall be firmly kept and observed throughout this realm, whereby merchants have had remedy and have recovered their ddbts with less inconvenience and trouble than they had heretofore.’ 44 But forasmuch as merchants after complained unto the King, that sheriffs misinterpreted his statutes, and some *

times by malice, and false interpretation delayed the execution of the statute, to the great damage of merchants; ” 4 The King at his Par4 liament holden at fFeoknintler, after Baiter, the thirteenth year of his reign, caused the said statute made at Acton Bumcl to be rehearsed?

IT. For the avoiding of all further doubt and trouble which in like cases may hereafter ensue, be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and by the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, That from henceforth the party at or by whose suit such writ of execution was pursued, his executors or administrators, after such time as the privilege of that session of Parliament in which such privilege shall be so granted shall cease, may sue forth and execute a new writ or writs of execution, in such manner and form as by the law of this realm he or they might have done, if no such former execu^on had been taken forth or served:And that from henceforth no sheriff, bailiff or other officer, from whose arrest or custody any such person so arrested in execution shall be delivered by

(1) The poundage includes all charges; and nothing can be charged for the expense of an auctioneer: and if more is taken by a bailiff than the statute allows, the action is maintainable against the sheriff. And by Butler J. “ In actions on simple contracts and judgments for a debt certain, the expense of levying must be paid by the plaintiff and not by the defendant; so that if the sheriff overcharge, the plaintiff is the sufferer. But if the judgment be for a penalty, the plaintiff has a right to receive the whole of his debt, independent of the expenses of the execution; and -in those cases-the defendant is the party injured by the sheriff’s taking more than he. ought y Woodgate v. Knatchbull, 2T. R. 148.

But by stat. 43 Geo. III. c. 46, (ante. Cl. III. No. 36). the plaintiff may levy the costs of the execution in all cases, and therefore the defendant is the party grieved if more is levied than the Act allows. I apprehend that this statute and the case cited are in practice very generally disregarded, and that the under-sheriff usually requires to be paid the whole of the poundage, xnd leaves the officer to obtain satisfaction by extorting illegal fees.

[No. XIII.] 3 James I. c. 8.—An Act to avoid unne' cessary Delays of Executions.

4 Tj'ORASMUCH as his Highness subjects are now more commonly 1 . withholden from their just debts, and often in danger to lose the same, by means of writs of error, which are more commonly sued than heretofore they have beenBe it therefore enacted by the authority of this present Parliament, That from and after the end of this present session of Parliament, no execution shall be stayed or delayed upon or by any writ of error, or supersedeas thereupon to be sued, for the reversing of any judgment given, or to be given, in any action or bill of debt upon any single bond for debt; or upon any obligation, with condition for the payment of money only; or upon any action or bill of debt for rent, or upon any contract; (1) sued in any of his Highness courts of record at Westminster, or in the counties palatine of Chester, Lancaster, or Durham, or in his Highness courts of Great Sessions in any of the twelve shires of Wales; unless such person or persons in whose name or names such writ of error shall be brought, with two sufficient sureties, such as the court (wherein such judgment is or shall be given) shall allow of, shall first before such stay made, or supersideas to be awarded, be bound unto the party for whom any such judgment is or shall be given, by recognizance to he acknowledged in the same court, in double the sum adjudged to be recovered by the said former judgment.

3 James 1. c. 8.

In what caaea execution shall not be stayed upon a writ of error.

(1) Bail in error is not necessary, under this statute, in debt for goods solds; Alexander tr. Bliss, 7 T. R. 449; or on a promissory note; Frier v. Bridgman, 2 E. 359: nor in debt or bond, conditioned for payment of money and performance of covenants j Butler v. Brushfield, 10 E. 407; nor a scire facias, on judgment by demurrer, on 8 and 9 W. HI. c. 11. a. 8. post in this Class; Sparks v. O'Kelly, 1 Taunt. 168: nor in any case where, upon any one taint, debt would not lie at the time of making the statute; Webb v. Geddes, 1 Taunt. 540. See other cases, in which bail in equity b required, l5 Chan. U. st. 2. c. 2. ante, Class HI. No. 13. And by 16 and 17 Charlesll. ch. 8. a. 3. (post. No. 17.) bail in erroris required in all personal actions after judgment. From the experience of the great mischiefs and inconveniences resulting from writs of error and injunctions in equity, for the purpose of delaying executions, 1 think it would be important to give a farther protection to persons in whose favour judgment has been obtained, and to provide that no execution should be stayed without the express order of the court, or one of the judges of the court, by which the judgment was given, J)r from which the writ of error has issued; or from the Lord Chancellor in case of error in Parliament; and that no

execution shall be stayed by injunction, except upon affidavit of the merits, and express order of the Court of Equity, or of the court in which judgment was given, or one of the judges thereof.

A similar principle has already been adopted by the House of Lords and the Court of Chancery, in cases of appeals, which do not stay the performance of the decree without express order.

Iu Johnes v. Johnes, Dows. P. C. 22. Lord Eldon C. said, 44 he had now been there for twelve yean, attending to writs of error, and he found, that not more than one in fifty was argued; so that forty-nine out of fifty were brought for delay. Delay was one of the greatest mischiefs in the administration of justice, and aa far as that could be decided by giving exemplary costs, their lordships would be disposed to check it.” Surely this testimony is of great importance, and the mischief complained of is very Httle diminished by any possible operation of the checks at present existing, The loss of official emoluments, which might perhaps operate as an impediment to any proposal for correcting the existing abuse, could be easily compensated by a very moderate charge upon executions In general.

TIL And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if Actions may there be two or more plaintiffs or defendants, and one or more of them proceed, not-should die, if the cause of such action shall survive to the surviving withstanding plaintiff or plaintiffs, or against the surviving defendant or defendants, the death of the writ or action shall not be thereby abated; (3) but such death being °ne of t“c Par~ suggested upon the record, the action shall proceed at the suit of the surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs against the surviving defendant or defendants. (4)

(1) Where either party dies after interlocn-toty judgment, and before the execution of the writ of inquiry, the scire facias upon this statute ought to be for the defendant or his executors, &c. to shew cause why the damages should not be assessed and recovered against them, (Lill. fintr. 047.) and to have the judgment of the court thereupon, (6 Mod. 144.) But when the death happens after the writ of inquiry is executed, and before final judgment, the scire facias must be to, shew cause why the damages assessed should not be adjudged to the plaintiff or his executors or administrators, (1 Wilt. 243; and see 1T. R. 308.) The judgment upon this statute is not entered for or against the party himself, as upon 17 Car. II., but for or against his executors or administrators, (1 Salk. 42.) And where the defendant dies after interlocutory and before final judgment, two writs of scire facias must be sued out by the plaintiff before he can have execution, one before the final judgment is signed, in order to make the executors or administrators parties to the record, and the other after final judgment is signed, in order to give them an opportunity of pleading no Meets, or other matter of

defence; Tidd’s Practice, chap. 42.

(2) Where a habeas corpus was brought after interlocutory and before final judgment, in an inferior court, and the defendant died before the return of it, a procedendo was awarded; because by this statute the plaintiff may have a scire facias against the executors, and proceed to judgment, which he cannot have in another court, and by this means he would be deprived of the judgment, which would be unreasonable; 1 Salk. 332; Tidd, cb. 17.

That in all actions, which from and after the said fire and twentieth day of March, One thousand six hundred ninety and seven, shall be commenced or prosecuted in any of his Majesty’s courts of recbrd, upon any bond or bonds, or on any penal sum, for non-performance of any covenants or agreements in any indenture, deed, or writing contained, the plaintiff or pUintifis may assign as many breaches as he or they shall think fit, and the jury, upon trial of such action or actions, shall and may assess, not only suck damages and costs of suit as have'heretofore been usually done in such cases, but also damages for such of the said breaches so to be assigned, as the plaintiff upon the trial of the issues shall prove to have been broken, and that the like judgment shall be entered on such verdict as heretofore hath been usually done in such like actions; and if judgment shall be given for the plaintiff on a demurrer, or by confession, or mkH dicUy the plaintiff upon the roll may suggest as many breaches of the covenants and agreements as he shall think fit, (1) upon which shall

(1) In the following passage (extracted from a general dissertation on the law of penal obligations, inserted in the appendix to the translation of Fothier,) it is attempted to take a general view of the law respecting the relief given againat a penalty, both in the construction of this statute and in the practice of courts of equity, and of the principles which seem fairly applicable to the stipulation of a particular compensation by way of penalty or damages. The freedom of observation indulged with respect to the judgment of one of the moat distinguished magistrates who ever adorned die judicial tribunals of the country, may probably be thought to require an apology; but hope that such apology will be offered in the wish to subject the justice of the observations commented upon to a fur examination, according to their intrinsic force and justice, without being diverted from that pursuit by the merited eminence of the illustrious person from whom they proceeded.

“ The effect of penal obligations is, according to the jurisprudence of this country, circumscribed within much narrower limits than their literal import. With respect to the interposition of courts of equity, Lord. Thurlow stated, in the case of Sloman v, Walter, 1 Bro. 418. that the rule that where a penalty is inserted merely to secure the enjoyment of a collateral object, the enjoyment of the object is considered as the principal intent of the deed, and the penalty only as accessional, and therefore, only to secure the damage really incurred, Was too strongly established in equity to be shaken. In the particular case it was agreed, that a partnership should be conducted entirely by one of the partners; but that the other* should have the enjoyment of a particular room whenever he thought proper; and a bond being given to enforce the agreement, his lordship seems to hrfvc been of opinion, that the case Was within the rule, as he continued the injunction to the hearing. The following are some of the cases which had previously been decided upon this subject:—Sale gave a bond to nd hi 20/.| not to disparage his trade, and

afterwards seeing a customer of Hyland's cheapening a parcel of .flounders, he said to him, “ Why would you buy of Ryland ? those fish stink.* Ryland put the bond in suit, and had a verdict: and it was held that equity would not relieve, because of the smallness of the sum; but the Lord Keeper said, it would be otherwise were the penalty greater, as 100/. or upwards; 1 Cham. 183; 1 Eq. Ah. 91.

On the sale of an estate, it was agreed that the purchaser should retain 400A for two years, without interest; and if the wife of the seller in that time released her dower, he was to pay the 400/., or else retain it absolutely. The seller having died, his Widow did not release her dower, but brought a writ of dower, and died before the recovery of it.' A bill was filed for the 400/., because it was but in the nature of the penalty to secure against the dower, which was then at an end, and the purchaser was secured aa well as if she had released within the two years, or after the two yean had expired; in which case, as it was said, the court would certainly have relieved. On the other aide, it was said, that this was not -in the nature of the penalty, but the term of the agreement, and the measure of the satisfaction for the contingent incumbrance of dower; and that the court would not have relieved on her release, much less when she was so far from releasing that'she brought her writ of dower, and if she had recovered it, and lived several yean, the purchaser could have had only the 400/.; and aa he run the hazard of her living, he ought to have the advantage of her dying; and of this opinion was the Lord Chancellor, and decreed accordingly; Small v. Lord Fitz-william, Prec. Chan. 102.

In Aylet r. Dodd, 2 Atkins, 328. and several other cases, it was laid down by Lord Hardwicke, that where there is a clause of nomine sense in a lease, to a tenant, to prevent bis reaking up and ploughing old nasture ground, the intention is to give the landlord some compensation for the damage he has sustained, and therefore, in that case, the whole nomine pen* shall be paid. And in Rolfe v. Peterson, 6 Brown, P. C. 460 (2d. Vol. 436, last edit.) the tenant covenanted, that in case any part of the premises, that had not been in tillage within twenty yean, should be converted into tillage,

Claps XII.] JTspd^pfsefs^—93$

issue .a writ to the sheriff of that county where the action shall he y0 vvt brought, to summon a jury to appear before the justices or justice of w vt« assize, or nisi print, of that county, to enquire of the truth of every one " *llgm

of those breaches, and to assess the damages that the plaintiff shall have ^*11* abstained thereby; in which writ it shall he commanded to the said jus- V^y^/

he would, for the remainder of the term, pay the further yearly rent of 5/. for every acre so converted; the tenant having converted into tillage a parcel of land before covered with furze, and an action being brought against him for this, and other breaches of covenant, and 300/. damages being recovered upon a judgment by default. Lord Camden directed an issue fumntum davutificatu *, ordering that the damages upon each breach of covenant should be found separately. Upon appeal to the House of Lords, in opposition to the argument, that the damages were increased to' so high a sum by means of the covenant to pay the increased rent, which was to be considered as a penalty, and that the court of equity could relieve against it, it was said that this was not a penalty, hut a liquidated satisfaction, fixed and agreed upon between the parties, and was reserved as an additional rent; whereas a penalty is a forfeiture for the better enforcing a prohibition, or a security for the doing some collateral Act. On the other side it was said, that these rigorous covenants, though seemingly made for the preservation of estates, are in effect a new mode of raising rents, more oppressive than the proceeding Wy ejectment, and are not in the nature of a contract, but of a penalty of vindictive damages; and therefore ought to receive no countenance in equity, as the penalty thereby reserved frequently exceeds the value of the inheritance. But the decree was reversed.

A lease for lives was made at the yearly rent Of 125/. with a clause, that if the tenant and his heirs, with all their family, did not live on the premises during the continuance of the lease, the rent should be raised to 150/. An action at law having been commenced upon this clause, the Court of Exchequer in Ireland grunted an' injunction; upon appeal to the House of Lords it was argued in support of the decree, that the covenant being inserted only for the sake of improvement, and to secure the rent reserved, the same had been substantially performed, and the design thereof answered; for it was admitted, that the lands were kept well stocked with more than sufficient to answer the rent; hut the decree was reversed; Pon-tonby ©. Adams, 6 Br. P. C. 497. (last edit. 2 voL 431.)

In Roy p. Duke of Beaufort, 2 Atkins, 190. the plaintiff and bis sou, while the son was in custody on the information of the duke's gamekeeper for carrying a gun, gave a bond, that

(a) Would not such evidence have been irrelevant? Atkins does not stale the proceedings at law: bat, from the nature of the thing, there most have been a plea, alleging that the son had not trespassed contrary to the condition of the bond, to which the replication must have answered, with stating a particular trespass.

the son should not commit any trespass in the duke’s royalties, by shooting, hunting, fishing, Ac.c. unless with the licence of the gamekeeper, or in company with a qualified person. The' son having caught two flounders with an angling-rod, m company with two servants of tile duke, one of whom (a brother-in-law of the gamekeeper) invited nim to go angttng with them; the bond was put in suit, sad a verdict obtained on the evidence of these servants, for the penalty, which, with 40L for costs, the plaintiff (his son being dead) was obliged to pay. Upon a bill filed by him for relief, the following questions were made: 1st., Whether the bond was obtained by oppression and imposition ? 2d., Whether.it should be only considered ss a security that the son should not poach for the future ? 3d., Whether an ill use had been made of the bond ? Lord Haidwicke, upon the first question, expressed his opinion in favour of the bond, and in the course of it, observed, in answer to an argument that the penalty was excessive, that to be sure - the penalty was a large one; but he did not know that courts of equity, where bonds have been entered into voluntarily, have ever gone so for «s to take into their consideration the matness or the smallness of the penalty: he should be extremely cautious how he gave an opinion that would set aside such bonds, which. If rightly used, might be of great service in the preservation of the game, and an equal benefit to the obligors themselves, by taking them out of an idle course of life, which poaching naturally leads them into. As to the head of security, he said, that it was most absurd, to think that bonds of this kind were intended merely ss a security, and that nothing was to be recovered upon them. He was of opinion, that when these kinds of bonds were given by way of stated damages between the parties, k was unreasonable to imagine, that they could only be intended as a bare security that the obligor should not offend for the fnture. “ Was this the case, (he said) in what respect is a gentle* man, who has taken such a bond, in a better condition than he was before, if, after he has obtained judgment at law, a court of equity will give him no other satisfaction than the bare value of the price of the game that is killed?” Upon the third point, he observed, that from the year 1729, when the bond was given, no evidence was offered of the son poaching until 1732; (a) and after killing these flounders, it rests two years, and no acTo have stated more trespasses than one, would have been bad, as being multifarious, except ss to the effect of the statute of William, which had not at that time been applied to such bonds as these, and which is not at all adverted to; and as one only was alleged, one only could be proved. If the son the minute after giving the

; said judgment shall be entered upon record i or if by reason of any

lion is brought; (a) afterwards, the plaintiff in equity was a witness against the two servants for a riot, and they were convicted chiefly on his evidence. It is a very material circumstance, that the son had a licence, (i) or at least an encouragement, to fish, by being in company with two of the duke's servants (c) (one of whom was brother-in-law to the gamekeeper) (d)* It frequently happens, that mere may be a just cause of action, yet the real motives may be very unjust, which a court of equity will always take into their consideration, though they cannot at law pay any regard to it. («) It appears, that the gamekeeper, who had the authority of the duke, who has been a witness to the transaction of tha bond, (/) gave a licence, or at least an encouragement, (f) to this fishing, which, as it was with an angling-rod only, cannot .be called poaching, nor was it ever so esteemed. (A) In such a tract of time as two years, it ia impossible to suppose that the gamekeeper could be ignorant of this fishing, especially as his own brother-in-law was in the company. (i)

“ According to the condition of this bond, the plaintiff could not be relieved at law, because his son could not fish without express leave from the gamekeeper, or in presence of a qualified person, so that if the Duke of Bean-fort himself (A) had given leave, there must at law hare been a verdict, because it is not within the express terms of the condition of the bond.

“ Now when a man has made this moderate use of his liberty (i) of fishing, and manifestly appears to have had leave, it would be hard not to relieve against the penalty recorded upon this bond at law."

The third point in the preceding case, though not immediately referable to the course of the present discussion, is inserted to shew the real ground upon which the case was determined; a ground that appears to me to be in every respect untenable, and which I nave commented

bond had shot a partridge before the duke's face, would not this have been a breach against the fall intention of the bond ? But what distinction can reasonably be made, as a matter of legal inquiry, between one time and another, when there is no distinction -by the contract itself?

(a) If aright of action once attached, in how short a Space of time was it requisite that the action should be brought, so as it waa not barred by any statute of limitations ?

(ti) This is quite out of the question.

(c) Can a man’s legal right be prejudiced by lus servant having, without his authority, concurred in the violation of it ?

(d\ What difference does this make ?

(e) This appears to be a moft dangerous doctrine. Where a man has a legal right, the motives which induce him to exercise that right, or to forbear from the exercise of it, must rest with himself. If he forbears the exercise of it, the duration of such forbearance ia also a matter of discretion, until the law has allowed it to operate as a bar. If a sentiment of personal disapprobation is a sufficient warrant for a court of equity to defeat the exercise of a legal right, the discretion assumed under this pretence will be so illimitable, as to eradicate all the principles of juridical certainty. If up to and at the time of the plaintiff giving evidence against the servants, (who, by the bye, probably did not, until that time, divulge the circumstance) the duke had a right of action which a court of equity would not controul him in tha exercise of, that right could sot be

defeated by such a circumstance taking place.

(/) Whist then ?

(g) Gave a licence, that is, did not give a licence, but gave an encouragement; the meaning of which does not appear, except as it may be inferred from what follows, that he probably would; therefore, that he actually did know at the circumstance within two years afterwards.

(A) The word poaching does not occur in the condition of the bond; out if he shall tretymm by JUking, the obligation shall be in force. The 'Act against stealing fish ia held to extend to angling.

(«) Is there any presumption juris et dgjmrt, that a man is cognizant of every act done in the presence of all his brothers-in-law; and to what further degrees of relationship in the principle to be earned ?

(A) Here another principle would apply to prevent a person taking advantage of a penalty incurred by his own act or consent; but that is a principle totally inapplicable to the present question. The condition might have bora made general without including an exception of the consent of the gamekeeper. When a particular exception is introduced, referable to one case, it is not the province of courts of justice to create a more extensive exception not contemplated by the contracting parties.

(/) What liberty? What leave? He either had leave from the gamekeeper, or he had not. If he had, it was a defence at law, hut the whole case assumes that he had not, and that the bond was legally forfeited.

upon in the notes with a freedom which may perhaps be regarded as arrogance, but which I must always assert as the privilege of a writer who wishes to extend his enquiries beyond the mere collection of authorities, and to investigate the principles of his subject, (a)

Upon the second point, I conceive the opinion of the eminent magistrate to be founded upon the most correct principles of-judicial reason; and I am persuaded that if these principles had been more extensively acted upon than they have been, the true object of penal obligations would have been more effectually promoted. If the penalties had been allowed to operate really in terrorem, by being actually levied when legally incurred, agreements would be more faithfully performed, from a terror of the consequences of their infraction; but the scarecrow doctrine of penalties being stipulated, merely fa terror cm, whilst they are known to have no efficient power, is little mfire than a trifling with language. No penalty is requisite to render a person liable to the damages which may be proved to have arisen from the non-perrormance of his agreements, but by a real liability to an actual penalty such non-performance will commonly be prevented.

In the following case a bond was given by the plaintiff to the defendant, who was a hair-merchant, as a security for his service and behaviour in Flanders, as an agent for the defendant in buying hair there; the plaintiff was to stay abroad till a certain season, and as

(a) Hie general doctrine of preventing an ill use being made of a bond is properly applicable to a subject of a different nature, and is principally instanced in the case of general bonds or resignation, which, ' when they were allowed to be valid in point of law, were prevented by courts of equity from being made the cover of simony; and, in any other case, a court would prevent a legal contract from being used as the engine of an illegal purpose. That Lord Hard-wieke should, from a sentiment of disapprobation of the conduct of the Duke of Bean-fort, have resorted to such reasoning as has been stated, would seem a caution anainst looking in legal proceedings at any other object than the true legal grounds of judicial determination. An objection, which might have deserved some attention in the principal case, vim. that the contract was repugnant to a principle of law, inasmuch as it was made by way of composition for dropping a criminal prosecution, was not made a point in the caae (except as cpnnected with the adventitious circumstance of oppression.) The decisions in subsequent cases would give considerable weight to such an objection if the question should hereafter arise.

1 (b) There seems to be an inaccuracy in the

phrase th«t the court could not decree the pea security for his performance of the agreement he deposited 100/. in the hands of the defendant. The plaintiff bought but five pounds' worth of hair for the defendant, and returned to England before the time agreed between them; and brought a bill for 50/., agreed to be paid for his trouble, and also for the deposit. It was insisted for the defendant, that tnia was a breach of the plaintiff's duty, and a forfeiture of the bond, and that the defendant had a right to retain the 100/. in satisfaction of the penalty, and that the court would not relieve against it, for it was the stated damages between the parties, and the counsel cited the above case of the Duke of Beaufort, and likewise compared it to the case of nomine panue in leases. The Lord Chancellor said, he could not decree this penalty, because it was a bond for services only, and different from the cases of a nomine panue in leases, to prevent a tenant from ploughing, because that was stated damages between the parties. Nor was it like the case of bonds given as a security not to defraud the revenue, because there, where a person is guilty of a breach, it was considered as a crime, and the Court of Chancery wonl4 not relieve for that reason. Here he could not decree the penalty, but must decree an action at law, upon a quantum damnificatus, to try how far the defendant had been damnified by the plaintiff's non-performance of his service; Benson v. Gibson, 3 Atk. 395. (5)

In the case of Hardy v. Martin, 1 Bro. c. 418, n.

nalty, because that expression would be rather applicable to a suit by the obligee to enforeo the penalty, than to one by the obligor to be relieved from it; but this inaccuracy is more probably imputable to the reporter than to the Lord Chancellor; as to the propriety of the decision, though there is not a similarity of circumstances to the cases mentioned, there does not appear to be any necessary opposition of principle; and it is impossible to suppose that the intention of the employer, in requiring the deposit, was any other than that It should be retained in case of the agent’s infraction of his duty. In these cases the iqjury which can be manifested by evidence to a jury, it almost necessarily much less than that which la actually experienced by the party.

When die Courts adopted the principle above cited, that if a penalty la merely inserted to secure the enjoyment of a collateral object, the enjoyment of the object is considered as the principal effect of the deed; if they had ne on to ask themselves how that effect would most folly obtained, they would have probably found the answer to be, an enforcement of the penalty when that enjoyment was wilfully withheld.

The distinct enunciation of the above principle in the case of Sloman r. Walter, Induced

one partner, on retiring from business, gare a bond of 6001. to the other, not to carry on the same business within certain limits; and after a verdict at law for the penalty, the Court of Chancery granted an injunction to stay execution, ana directed an issue to take an account of the damage actually sustained.

In case of a penalty for non-performance of covenants or agreements, 'the courts of equity, in like manner, exercised a jurisdiction of restraining the recovery to the amount of damage assessed by a jury. At common law, the rules of pleading, which require issues to he taken upon a single point ip general, confined the plaintiff to state a single breach of the agreement, for the performance of which the penalty was stipulated; hut this restriction did not exist in cases where the breach of the agreement was stated in the declaration, in which the plaintiff may allege his complaint as extensively as he finds convenient.

Bystat. 8 and 9 W.3.C.11. it is enacted, that In all actions in any court of record, upon any bond, or any penal sum, for non-performance of any covenants or agreements, contained in any indenture, deed, or writing, the plaintiff may assign as many breaches as he thinks fit, and the jury shall assess damages upon such breaches as the plaintiff shall prove to have been broken; and if judgment shall be given for the plaintiff on demurrer, or confession, ojr by nil dicit, the plaintiff may suggest upon the roll as many breaches as he shall think fit, upon which a writ shall issue to the sheriff to summon a jury before the justices of assize, to enquire of the truth of those, breaches, and to assess the damages; and upon payment of such damages with the costs, execution shall be stayed; but the judgment shall remain as a security, to answer for any damages to be afterwards sustained by any future breach.

The natural construction of this Act does not seem to apply to bonds, with a condition to do or not to do any given Act, without there being any other distinct agreement, that such Act shall be done: but in Collins v. Collins, 2 Btur. 824. above cited, where the condition of a bond was that the defendant should pay an annuity to the plaintiff, and should also maintain him, Lord Mansfield arid, “ This is an

me to mention that case before the others upon the same subject, which are anterior to it in point of time.

(a) See Bird v. Randall, post.

(d) The Act is penned in a most careless manner: but I think that this is evidently the true costruction of it upon the point in qnesagreement between the parties, and an agreement in writing; the condition of the bond is an agreement m writing, and people have frequently gone into courts of equity upon conditions of bonds as being agreements in writing, to have a specific performance.* I qgnnot help thinking that there is more ingenuity than solidity in this reasoning; for though in equity the condition of a bond is regarded m evidence of an agreement, that the Act referred to shall be done, such conditions are not regarded as agreements at law, and cannot be declared upon as such; and where there was another subject to which the words of the statute were naturally applicable, it would have been as well to avoid extending the operation of it to a case, that does not naturally present itself to the mind, as being in the view of the Legislature, and to which the words can only be applied by a forced and foreign construction. It is however settled, in conformity with the above opinion, that the statute extends generally ta all bonds for the performance of say condition; Walcot v. Goulding, 8 T.R. 124. A bond to the Lord Chancellor, pursuant to stat. 5 Geo. II. c. 30, upon taking out a commission' of bankrupt, is not within the Act \ Smitliey «. Edmonson, 3 East, 22.

It is now also settled that the Act is compulsory, and that the plaintiff is not at liberty to proceed for the penalty as at common law, although there have been decisions, and there seems to have been a tacit practice the other way. (a) Drage v. Brand, 2 Wils. 377, Goodwin v. Crowle, Cowp. 357. Hardy v. Bow, 5 T. R. 036. In the last esse. Lord Kenyon, and Mr, Justice Buller, . certified their opinion in writing to the Lord Chancellor, upon a writ of error from a judgment of the Exchequer) they stated that it was apparent to them, that the law was made in favour of defendants, and was highly remedial, calculated to give plaintiffs relief up to the extent of the dsmagr sustained, and to protect defendants against the payment of further suns than what wea in conscience due, * and also to take away the necessity of proceedings in equity, to obtain relief against an unconsekntious demand of the whole penalty, in cases where small damages only had accrued. (4) See also Roles v. Rosewell, 5 T.R. 540.

tion, and that the Apt is compulsory upon the plaintiff as to assigning some breach, but was discretionary merely as to the number of breaches In any other point of view there would he a manifest absurdity, in providing that the plaintiff might assign as many breaches as he pleased, upon judgment on demurrer, Ac, and damages

But there are cases where the penalty stipulated by the parties can be the only true and proper measure of justice; and though there is a technical distinction between a penalty and stated damages, to which I am about to proceed, 1 think it would be in general proper to regard the penalty as stated damages, unless there is some particular reason in the nature of the contract to the contrary. Many times engagements are entered into upon considerations, wholly arising out of the personal feelings of the parties. The person making such engagement of course acts under an adequate inducement, and the person who hss given that inducement ought not to be deprived of the full security of an object, the personal importance of which can only be justly appreciated by himself. On the other hand where a bond is evidently a mere bond of indemnity from pecuniary loss, the extent of the loss is the extent of the damages. In many cases, the actual damage which could be brought under the contemplation of a jury must be as nothing; and if the nominal sum awarded in such cases, was the only consequence that could attach upon a person violating his engagement, the sanction provided with a view to its real and efficient security would be Wholly frustrated. 1 shall have an opportunity presently of referring more conveniently to a case in which this sentiment was judicially adopted.

in all the eases above mentioned, where k was held that equity could not relieve against the sum agreed upon by the parties, I conceive it may betaken for granted, that the sum stipulated to he paid is the oftly proper measure for the decision of the jury; and whether the form of the transaction is held to be a penalty or stipulated damages (the line of discrimination between which is not very accurately marked.) the sum so agreed is the amount which ought -to be recovered.

In the case of Lowe v. Peers, 4 Burr. 2225, the defendant promised the plaintiff that he would not many aay person besides herself, and that if he did, would pay her (the plaintiff) toow. (a) at the end of three months. Lord Mansfield, after stating the proceedings in the cause, said, that the jury had given 1000/. damages; and by law and in justice, the defends ant ought to pay the 1000/. Money is the measure of value. Therefore what else could tbb jury find but this 1000/., (unless they had

should be asAesaed, itc, j for before that time he might take his judgment and execution for the whole penalty, without assigning any breach at all; aad giving him an option to assign a breach to suable him to recover a part of the penalty, instead of taking the whole without having recourse to that proceeding, would not be productive of any expensive practical consequence.

(a) The promise was held to be void, but

also riven interest after the three months.) This is not an action brought against him for not marrying her, or for his marrying any one else; the non-payment of the 1000/. is the ground of the action. The money was payable on a contingency, and the contingency; has happened, therefore it ought to be pmd. There is a difference between covenants in general, and covenants secured by a penalty or forfeiture. In the latter case the obligee has his election. He may either bring an action of debt for the penalty, and recover the penalty, after which recovery or the penalty he cannot resort to the covenant, because the penalty U to be a satisfaction for the whole $ or j/ he does not choose to go for the penalty, he may

{iroceed upon the penalty, and recover more or ess than the penalty totie* juotia. And upon' this distinction they proceed in courts of equity. They will relieve against a penalty upon a compensation; but where the covenant U to pay a particular liquidated mm, a court of equity cannot make a new covenant for a man; nor u there any room for compensation or relief, as ip leases containing a covenant against ploughing up a meadow i if the covenant be not to plough, and there be a penally, a court of equity will relieve against the penalty, or will even go .further than that to preserve the substance of the agreement; but if it is worded, to pay 5/. an acre, for every one ploughed np, there is no alternative, no relief against it, no room for compensation; it is the substance of the agreement. Here the specified sum of 1000/. is found in damages (4); it is the particular liquidated sum fixed and agreed u£on between the parties, and is therefore- the prosper quantum of the damages. It is dear that where the precise sum is not the smence of the agreement, the quantum of the damages may, be assessed by the jury; but where the precise sum is fixed and agreed upon hstwean the parties, that very sum is the ascertained damage, and the jury are confined to iterAsd the other judges gave their opinions to the same effect.

Where persons contracting for the iron work of a building, agreed to perform it ia six weeks, and tp pay Iff/. a week afterwards until it was done, and gave a bond in a penalty for the performance, k was held that the 1ML a weak was in the nature of liquidated daaaages; aad it was said by Mr. Justice Ashhuret, that the object of

the amount which ought to he recovered, supposing it to be good, was previously discussed, which perhaps was necessary in regard to the question of costs.

(4) His lordship at the trial directed the jury to find for the plaintiff with 1000A damages, if they thought the deed fed one Thu last, by the bye, was rather an odd print to leave to a jury.

Mr. Justice Duller said, that when there is a penalty in the bond, it was strange that the sum mentioned in the condition should be called a penalty; he did not know that there could be an equitable and a legal penalty; but that was as strongly a case of liquidated damages as could possibly exist, and was like the case of demurrage. In either case it is impossible to ascertain what the damages are, and the parties agree to pay a stipulated sum. Fletcher«. Dyke, 2T.R.32.

In Astley v. Weldon, 2 Bos. 346. the defendant engaged to perform at the plaintiff’s theatre for a certain time, and to attend performances and rehearsals, or subject herself to the fines established at the theatre. There were also several agreements on the part of the plaintiff. And it was agreed between the parties, that either of them neglecting to perform the agreement should pay to the other 200L” The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant, for refusing to perform, and for wholly withdrawing from the theatre; and the declaration concluded with stating that by reason thereof she became liable to pay the sum of 2001. in the articles mentioned. It being proved that the agreement was broke by the defendant absenting herself, and evidence having been given that by the regulations of the theatre, the performers were subject to certain small fines for inebriety, late attendance, &c. a verdict was found for the plaintiff with 20/. damages, with liberty for the plaintiff to enter a verdict for 200/. damages, if the court should be of opinion that the sum mentioned in the agreement, was to be considered in the nature of liquidated damages. After argument, it was held that the question of damages was properly left to the jury. Lord Eldon said, that when the cause came before him at nisi prists, he felt, as he had often done before in considering the various cases on this head, much embarrassed in ascertaining the principle upon which those cases were founded; but it appeared to him that the articles in this case furnished a more satisfactory ground for determining whether the sum

of money therein mentioned ought to be considered in the nature of a penalty or of liquidated damages, than most others which he had met with; what was urged in the course of the argument had ever appeared to him to be the clearest principle, viz. that where a doubt is stated whether the sum inserted be intended as a penalty or not, if a certain danuwe less than that sum is made payable upon the face of the same instrument, in case the Act intended to be prohibited be done, that sum shall be constiued a penalty. The case of SI Oman v. Walter, did not' stand in need of this principle; for there, by the very form of the instrument, the sum appeared to be a penalty, in which case a court of equity could never consider it as liquidated damages, but must direct an issue of quantum damnificatus. A principle has been said to have been stated in several cases, the adoption of which one cannot but lament, namely, that if the sum would be very enormous and excessive, considered as liquidated damages, it shall be taken to be a penalty, though agreed to be paid in the form of contract. This has been said to have been stated in Rolfe v. Peterson, where the tenant was restrained from stubbing up timber. But nothing can be more obvious than that a person may set an extrnordiaaxv ▼slue upon a particular-piece of land or wood, on account of the amusement which it may afford him. In this country a man has a right to secure to himself a property in his amusements, and if he choose to stipulate for 5 L or 50L additional rent upon every acre of furee broken up, dr for any given sum of money upon every load of wood cut and stubbed up, he saw nothing irrational in such a contract; and it appeared to him extremely difficult to apply with propriety the word “excessive, * to the terms in which parties choose to contract with each other. His Lordship made some observations upon the preceding cases on this subject, and said that with respect to Hardy t>. Martin, he did not understand why one tradesman, who purchases the good will of a shop from another, may not make it a matter of agreement, that if the vendor trade in the same article within a certain distance, he shall pay 600/., and why the party violating such agreement should not be bound to pay the sum agreed for; though if such agreement were entered into in the form of a bond, with a penalty, it might perhaps make a difference. (a) In his observations upon the parfa) If such was admitted to be the real intention of the parties, there can be no foundation for a court of equity, whose peculiar province is to preserve and maintain the substance of transactions, to subvert both form and substance, in a manner which renders the transaction itself wholly nugatory. The damage which can be actually proved in such

case as this must in general be nothing, because it is very difficult to shew that the profit received by the one, would in particular cases have otherwise fallen to the other; but the real injury sustained by continuing the trade in violation of the agreement, may at the same time incalculably exceed the stipulated penalty.

ticular ease, his lordship referred to the pecuniary payments agreed to be made by the plaintiff, and also to the small fines, which, according to the regulations of the theatre, were to be paid by the defendant; inferring that in these cases the sum of 200/. was only, to be regarded as a security for the stipulated payments; and .that there was not any ground for distinguishing between these ana the other

rrts of the agreement. Mr. Justice Heath, the course of hisopinion, said; it was very difficult to lay down any general principle in cases of this kind, but he thought there was one which might safely be stated; that where articles contain covenants for the performance of several things, and then one large sum is stated at the end to be paid upon breach of performance, that must be considered as a penalty; but where it is agreed that if a party do such a particular thing, such a sum shall be paid by him, there the sum stated is treated as^ liquidated damages. Mr. Justice Chambre said, that though in point of form the action was for damages, 'yet if the parties are to be considered as having stipulated for certain'damages, the jury ought to be directed to find damages, to the amount of the whole sum so agreed for, and the effect of the case must have been the same, as if the plaintiff had declared in debt for a penal sum. After taking notice of some of the decisions above cited, he said, there is one case in which the sum agreed for must always be considered as a penalty, and that is, where the payment of a smaller sum is secured by a larger; in this case, it is impossible to garble the covenants, and to hold that in one case the plaintiff shall only recover for the damages actually sustained; and in another, that he shall recover the penalty; the concluding clause applies equally to all the covenants. With respect to the case of Hardy v. Martin, in which he was concerned, Lord Mansfield, upon the trial at law, inclined to think it a case of stipulated damages: though it appeared by the printed report, that it was considered otherwise in a court of equity. («)

In Legh v. Lewis, a bond was given by the defendant to the plaintiff in 400/., to resign the situation of master of a school at Knutsford, upon the plaintiff's request; the validity of this bond was established upon demurrer, by the Court of King's Bench, 1 East 391. The case afterwards came on at Chester Assizes for an inquiry of damages:on the one hand, it was contended that as the plaintiff had not any personal interest, the damages should be merely nominal; on the other hand, that they ought to be given for the entire penalty. Mr. Mansfield, and Mr. Burton, the justices of Chester, supported this latter opinion in a very elaborate discussion of the subject, and the damages were found accordingly; the judges considering that it was the intention of the parties, that an actual liability to the penalty should operate as a sanction, for the performance of the primary obligation to resign. (b)

From the above series of cases which I have cited, at much greater length than is consistent with my general plan, it is obvionsly no easy matter to determine, in what cases the sanction^ intended by the parties to enforce the performance of their engagements, shall or shall not be permitted to take effect But in framing an instrument for this purpose, I think the best way will be to express the condition or engagement, in terms declaring that the party snail do, or not do the Act intended, or in default thereof shall pay the sum of a* and far stipulated damage *, far

the tameand also to insert as a penalty, ' a larger sum than that agreed to be payable as stipulated damages: and in case it is intended that the party making default shall be liable to pay a certain stipulated sum, but that the other shall not lose his right to general damages, to add, “ and such further damages as the said — shall in that behalf sustain;" or otherwise to add a proviso, “ that the damages above stipulated shall not prejudice the right of the said to sue for any other or greater damages, for and on account of the non-performance of the agreement."

(a) This case would regularly come before Lord Mansfield a second time, upon the issue directed by the Court of Chancery, and perhaps it was upon that occasion that he expressed the opinion alluded to; for a direction to the jury that they had no other guide, than the penalty in the bond would certainly be more proper and judicious than any other.

HERE AS injustice is frequently done to creditors by secret warrants of attorney to confess judgments for securing the payment of money; whereby persons in a state of insolvency are enabled to keep up the appearance of being in good circumstances, and the persons holding such warrants of attorney nave the power of taking the property of such insolvents in execution at any time, to the exclusion of the rest of their creditors: For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the twenty-ninth day of September next, if the holder thereof shall think fit, every warrant of attorney to confess judgment in any personal action, or a true copy thereof, and of the attestation thereof, and the defeasance and indorsements thereon, in case such warrant of attorney shall be given to confess judgment in his Majesty’s Court of King's Bench at Westminster, or such a true copy thereof as aforesaid, in case such warrant of attorney shall be

given to confess judgment in any other court, shall, within twenty-one ays alter the execution of such warrant of attorney, be filed, together with an affidavit of the time of the execution thereof, with the clerk of the dockets and judgments in the said Court of King's Bench.

II. And be it further enacted, That from and after the said twenty-ninth day of September next, if at any time after the expiration of twenty-one days next after the execution of such warrant of attorney, a commission of bankrupt shall be issued against the person who shall have given such warrant of attorney, under which he shall be duly found and declared a bankrupt, then and in such case, unless such warrant of attorney, or a copy thereof, shall have been filed as aforesaid, within the said space of twenty-one days from the execution thereof, or unless judgment shall have been signed, or execution issued on such warrant of attorney, within the same period, such warrant of attorney, and the judgment and execution thereon, shall be deemed fraudulent and void against the assignees have been filed as before directed.

And whereas-the object of the said provision may be defeated by any person giving a cognovit actionem instead of a warrant of attorney to confess judgment; be it further enacted, That every cognovit actionem, given by any defendant in any personal action, in case the action in which maDtier or such cognovit actionem shall be given shall be in the said Court of King’s Tui<j against Bench, or a true copy of such cognovit actionem in case the action wherein Creditors, the same is given snail be in any other court, shall, together with an affidavit of the time of the execution thereof, be hied with the said clerk, in like manner as such warrants of attorney, or copies thereof and affidavits, within the space of twenty-one days after such cognovit actionem shall have been executed, otherwise such cognovit actionem, and any judgment entered up thereon, and any execution taken out on such judgment, shall be deemed fraudulent and void against the assignees of the person giving such cognovit actionemr, under a commission of bankrupt issued against him, after the expiration of the said space of twenty-one days, in like manner as warrants of attorney, and judgments and executions thereon, are deemed and taken to be fraudulent and void by this Act.

(1) For fhe form and course of proceedings in bills of exceptions, see Bull. N. P. 315; Tidd’s Practice, C. 38. See also the view of the subject taken by Lord Redesdale in the case of the lessee of Lawlor v. Murray, 1 Schoales and Lefroy, 75, in which case his Lordship superseded a writ obtained from the cursitor, without order grounded upon this statute, commanding the judges of the King's Bench in Ireland, to affix their seals to a bill of exceptions, against an order for liberty to amend the record; holding, that no officer of the court was warranted in making such writ without special order; and secondly, that if any officer was so warranted, it was not the cursitor. He observed, that the authorities in support of his opinion were few, because the writ itself had been rarely used it had rarely been necessary to resort to it, as the judges would be most likely to seal the bill of exceptions in any case where they ought In the marginal abstract of the case it is stated, that such writ does not lie where the exception taken is to an order of a court of law, amending one of its own records. Nor tembU to any onler made upon motion. I do not find this opinion expressed in the body of the report: but it seems in itself to be perfectly correct.

The better opinion seems to be, that a bill of

exceptions does not lie in criminal cases. The following summary of the authorities is extracted from Mr. Phillips's Law of Evidence, 111. “ The statute extends to the plaintiff as well as the defendant, and to a trial at bar as well as at nisi prius; but it has been doubted whether it extends to criminal cases. Lord Coke, in his exposition of the statute, states that it extends to all actions, real, personal, and mixed; but of criminal cases he makes no mention. In the case of Sir Henry Vane, (I Lev. 68; Kel. 15; 1 Sid. 85.) who was tried for high treason, the court refused to seal a bill of exceptions, because, they said, criminal cases were not within the statute, but only actions between party and party. From this authority Mr. Serjeant Hawkins infers only, that a bill of exceptions is not allowable on an indictment for treason or felony; PI. Cro. v. 2. c. 46. s. 210. Whether a bill lies not in any criminal case, ' said Lord Hardwicke, 4 is a point not settled; ' Rex v. Inhabitants of Preston, Rep. temp. Hind. 251. It was allowed in the case of the King against Lord Paget and Others, on an indictment for a trespass; 1 Leon, 5; and also on an information in the nature of a quo warranto; Rex v. Higgins and Others, 1 Vent, 366. But Lord Hardwicke, in the case before referred to, after saying that he had known *

ITEM, Because divers mischiefs have happened for that in divers places, as well in the Chancery as in the King’s Bench, the

bill of exceptions allowed in informations in the Exchequer, which are civil suits for the King's debt, added, that it has never been determined to lie in mere criminal proceedings in other courts.

From the langnage of the statute itself, I certainly should not infer its application to criminal cases. The rule that the King is not bound by the general words of an Act of Parliament would also seem to militate against such construction; and perhaps the cases in the Exchequer, which are in opposition to this application of the maxim, may have passed without discussion or opposition. The general feeling of the profession upon the subject is most strongly evinced by the fact of no such bill of exceptions haring been tendered for a very long period of time, although many important questions of criminal law have been discussed with great warmth, and with strong feelings of opposition to the opinions of the court, of which the much agitated question of the functions of the jury in cases of libel, previous to the statute of 32 George III., is perhaps the most prominent instance. Upon referring to the case In 1 Leon. 5, which is the only direct authority alleged in support of the opposite opinion, it appears that the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, being indicted for a trespass in the close of Lord Paget, challenged the array, because that he being a lord of Parliament no knight was returned, upon which the Queen's counsel did demur in law; but at last, for expedition, &c. the court delivered to the counsel for the bishop, a bill pealed to secure him the advantage of the said challenge, and the inquest was taken de bene tut, The case was finally disposed of in favour of the defendant upon an objection to the indictment, and no argument or discussion whatever took place as to the general question of the admitting bills of exceptions m criminal cases i but the course seems to have been adopted by general consent at the suggestion of the judge, as the most convenient way of saving the question of challenge. It seems doubtful whether the challenge of the array is quite the proper object of a bill of exceptions, and whether such challenge ought not, independently of the statute, to be introduced on the record, so as to entitle the party to the benefit of a writ of error in case of its being overruled.

* The case of the quo warranto in Ventr. seems to give as little direct support tq the general right to a bill of exceptions, even in that mixed form of proceeding. That was also the case of a challenge to the jury, on the ground of their not being freeholders. The court held, that the statutes requiring jurymen to have so much freehold, do not extend to corporate

towns. It was then said, that by the common law jurymen were to be freeholders. But the court overruled the challenge; but at the importunity of the counsel they allowed a bill of exceptions, and a verdict passed against the defendants, and afterwards it was moved in arrest of judgment upon the point. But the court would not admit the matter to be debated before them, (though divers precedents of the like nature were offered) because they said they had delivered their opinions before, and the redress might be had upon writ of error.

In this case also it is observable, that there was no discussion as to the general question of a bill of exceptions being admissible in regard to the particular kind of proceeding. The bill of exceptions is stated to be admitted at the importunity of the defendant's counsel; but it is certainly contrary to the general understanding respecting this proceeding, that the admission or rejection of it shall be discretionary in the court; and I apprehend that in all cases where a bill of exceptions is held properly to lie, it is considered as perfectly a matter ie jure, to require an acceptance of the tender of it.

Bills of exceptions are in practice not frequently resorted to, which I think is rather to be regretted as far as regards the general interests of legal science, and the doe investigation of those principles, upon whidfc it is most important to establish general conclusions of jurisprudence. It is impossible to deny the existence of a certain feeling of disrespect sop-posed to be connected with them. Of this, one of the strongest proofs Is the apology by winch they are always accompanied, and the declaration of inoffensiveness with which they are as constantly received; whereas, to have their proper effect and influence in the administration of justice, it is desirable that they should pass without any adventitious notice, and be treated as matter of course in the same manner as a common motion for a new trial. Sir James Burrough, in recording the great quantity of business dispatched in the Court of King's Bench at the period comprised in the first four volumes of his Reports, (insignificant as it was in comparison to the present) sad noticing the small proportion of writs in London ana Middlesex which afterwards came before the court in the shape of special verdicts, special cases, motions for new trial, or in arrest of judgment, adds that of a Mil of exceptions there had been no instance, which certainly affords undeniable evidence of the kind of feeling adverted to.

The advantage arising from the fell and deliberate discussion of a question introduced in the record, is strongly exemplified in the

famous case of Bent and Baker, in which many vague notions respecting the competence of witnesses, which had before prevailed, were fully refuted, and the doctrine was reduced to a plain, general, and intelligible principle. In cases where the objection to be encountered slates to evidence supposed to be improperly received, the party taking the exception cannot be met by the observation, (which sometimes prevails upon motions for new trials,) that independently of the evidence objected to, there was sufficient to warrant the jury to come So the same conclusion, when possibly the particular evidence may have been the connecting link, upon which the credit of all the mat may have depended. In some cases, as where the objection is to the want of a proper stamp, the ground of such objection may be removed in the event of obtaining a new trial. The expense attending the proceeding by writ of error, in which alone a bill of exceptions is of any avail, is sometimes considered as a reason against resorting to it; but 1 am inclined to think, that the expenses of a second trial at Uaai priiis would generally exceed those of removing the record; although in this respect mneh will in every case depend upon adventitious circumstances. 1 certainly think that it would be a, considerable improvement if the law in this respect were altered, and that a hOI of exceptions taken at nisi prius might be Signed in the first instance in the court in wferioh the notion is brought. At the time of panring the statute, and long afterwards, almost all important issues were tried at bar, a mods of trial which is now almost entirely discontinued, and of which 1 do not remember three instances in civil cases. The sittings at nisi prius in Middlesex were not instituted until a comparatively modem period, and the summary relief given upon motions for new trials was not introduced until near four centuries after the passing of the Act. The discussion of exceptions in the same court would at that time have been very much an appeal ab vodem ad candcm; whereas at present that objection would not apply, and the other difficulties at present operating against this mode of reserving the discussion of a disputed question, would be in a great measure removed.

A demurrer to evidence coincides with a bill of exceptions in the circumstance that it is a means whereby the party can, at his own discretion, introduce the point which he contends for on the record; but the cases in which there is a convenient opportunity of doing so are but unfrequent, and the instances of this procedure are, 1 apprehend, still more rare than those of bills of exceptions. In order to take this course, not only the truth of the evidence must be admitted, and withdrawn from the jury, but the presumptions and inferences to be deduced from such facts must be also conceded* See upon this subject, Wright v. Pindar, Alleyn, 18, cited 2H.B. 208. The following view of the subject by Buller* J. in Cocksedge v. Fanahaw, Doug. 134, (the judgment of the court, in conformity to which was affirmed in the Exchequer Chamber and House of Lords, n. ibid.) is very distinct: “•Upon the question, —What is the nature of a demurrer to evidence ? I think Mr. Davenport (the counsel for the defendant) has gone a great way too far. It is the province of a jury alone to judge of the truth of facts and the credibility of witnesses, and the party cannot, by a demurrer to evidence or any other means, take that province from them, and draw such questions ad aimd examen. I think the plain and simple rule i* this:—The demurrer admits^ the truth of all faeta, which, upon the evidence stated, might be found by the jury in favour of the party offering the evidence. Mr. Davenport puts the case of a special verdict, and says, the reason for a demurrer is, that the party demurring does not choose to trust the jury. In a certain degree that is true: but the reason of not trusting the jury is, because they may, if they please, refuse to find a special verdict, and then the facta never appear on the record. But whether the case comes before the court on a demurrer to evidence, or a special verdict, the law is the same. I agree with Mr. Wood in Ids definition of a demurrer to evidence, via. that it admits all matters of fact which a jury might find, and only brings the demurrer upon the inference, in point of law, from those facta before the court.*' The matter was brought to a more precise point by the opinion of the judges, as delivered by Eyre, C. J., in Gibson and Johnson tr. Hauler, 2 H. B. 187, 209, in Dom. Proc., in which, after an examination of preceding authorities, he stated it to be the answer of the judges to a

Siestioa proposed by the House, “ that upon e state of the evidence given for the plaintiff, it was not competent to the defendants to insist upon the jury being discharged from giving a verdict by demurring to the evidence, and obliging the plaintiff to join m demurrer, without distinctly admitting upon the record every fact and every conclusion which the evidence given for the plaintiff tended to prove."

In cases which can be fiurly brought within this rule, and where the matter in dispute it reduced to a plain and distinct point of law, I apprehend that a demurrer to evidence, however unusual, would in many cases be found a very judicious course of proceeding, as well in respect of the interests of the immediate parties as in producing a solemn and deliberate decision upon the legal question.

With respect to special verdicts, these are considered by Sir W. Bfockstope, 3- Com. 377,

as grounded upon stat. West. 2d. 13 Edward I. c. 30. s. 2., (ante, Class I. No. 4.) which provides, that “ the justices assigned to take assises shall not compel the jurors to say precisely whether it he a disseisin or not, so that they do shew the truth of the deed, and require aid of the justices. But if they of their own head will say, that it is disseisin, their verdict shall be admitted at their own peril.*' This peril, at the time of passing the Act, and when the proceeding by attaint was in full force, was not a mere empty sound. But the language of the statute does not by any means import that special verdicts were previously unknown; and Lord Coke, in his Commentary upon the statute, 2 Inst. 425, says, —“ In the end it hath been resolved, that in all actions, real, personal, and mixed, and upon all issues, joint, special, or general, the jury might find the special matter of fact pertinent and binding only to the issue joined, and therepon pray the discretion of the court for the law, and this the jury might do at the common law, not only in cases between party and party, whereof this Act putteth an example of the assize, but also ixr pleas of the Crown, which is a proof of the common law; for if this Act had made a new law, and that other like cases between party and party had been taken by equity, yet the King had not been bound thereby.’* It may be here incidentally noted, that this observation confirms the opinion already expressed against the right to tender a bill of exceptions in criminal proceedings, a» there is no question as to the statute being in that respect a new law.

In comparing special verdicts with special cases, it is a well known distinction that the latter form no part of the record, and therefore cannot be made the subject of review. Upon a special verdict, if the judges are equally divided, nothing can be done, but the matter remains in suspence: bnt if the verdict is taken for the plaintiff subject to a case, and there is an equal division, 1 appfehend the course to be, the judgment will be given according to the verdict. This/nay sometimes operate materially to the disadvantage of defendants, as the statement of the case by no means necessarily imports an opinion of the court of nisi print in favour of the plaintiff.

Another distinction, which I apprehend to exist between special cases and special verdicts is, that in the latter every thing mnst be formally found, and nothing can be presumed as the actual conversion in trover, of which the demand and refusal are only evidence, but that the same particularly is not requisite with respect to special cases, which are rather in the nature of a reference to the court, as to the direction which should properly have been given to the jury st the trial.

Tm a former publication, after noticing the

case of Roe on the demise of Reade *. Reade, 8 T. R. 123, in which Lord Kenyon laid it down, that when the beneficial enjoyment haa given rise to suppose that there possibly may have been a conveyance to the person equitably entitled, a jury may be allowed to presume a conveyance, but if it appeared on a special verdict or special case, that the legal estate was outstanding in another person, the party not clothed with the legal estate cannot recover in a court of law; I took the liberty to observe that I perfectly acceded to this position, as it applies to the case of special verdicts, but that with respect to a special case, I did not think the doctrine equally clear; for that such acaae is in its principle a reference to the court respecting what ought to have been done at the trial, and had been introduced in lieu of a former practice for the judge to reserve a case for his own subsequent consideration; that if the conveyance of the legal estate is, with reference to the case, a question of presumption upon the actual fact, and upon which the jury ought to be directed to exercise their judgment, and to decide whether such fact existed

or not, in the same manner as they would exercise a judgment upon any other matter of presumptive evidence, the court cannot assume the office of the jury, and infer the fact themselves. But if the presumption is suck as ought dejure to be made in pursuance of rules generally laid down; if the jury are not to be directed to consider whether the inference does or does not arise, but are to be told that it is a presumption which they are to make in consequence of an established rule of practice, in order to prevent the party being turned round upon the legal objection; in other words, if it is an established legal fiction, the omission of stating it in a special case ought not to be material; for the object of such a case is either to ascertain some other point respecting the title, or to decide whether it is a case to which the presumption de jure, or legal fiction, properly applies ? whether, independent of the finding of the jury upon any thing which ought [not] to be submitted to them as a disputable fact, the plaintiff is entitled to recover ? and to have a more deliberate consideration of the questions intended to be particularly reserved, than the nature of the proceeding at nisi.prius will admit. A special verdict in ejectment must formally state the lease, entry and ouster of the nominal plaintiff, but this is never done in a special case; the one being, in respect of formalities and matters of course, governed by principles essentially different from the other. —View of Lord Mansfield's Decisions, Vol. II. p. 236, n.—A practice has lately been introduced of reserving a special case, with liberty to turn it into a special verdict, which is a very convenient course of proceeding, as it is attended with a saving of expense in the first

• good advice of themselves, the chancellor, treasurer, the justices of

instance, and allows the benefit of a further revision of the disputed question.

With respect to the facility of granting cases, and the 'mode of stating them, I have often regretted the deviation wich has taken place from the course pursued by Lord Mansfield, and which was stated by himself in Luke v. Lyde, 1 Bur. 887, as follows: 44 He said he had always inclined (even when he had himself no doubt) to make cases for the opinion of the court, not only for the greater satisfaction of the parties in the particular cause, but to prevent other disputes, by making the rules of law, and the grounds on which they are established, certain and notorious; but he took particular care that they should not cause delay or expense; and therefore he always dictated a case in court, and saw it signed before another cause was called, and always made it a rule that it should he set down to be argued within the first four days of the term.’* Mr. Justice Park, in the Introduction to his Treatise on Insurance, contrasts this course with the preceding practice, stating that it had been the custom when cases were reserved, to leave it to the counsel on both sides to draw them up at leisure. This introduced considerable delays, for every fact became a subject of dispute; and frequently, from the hurry of business and other avocations of counsel, the case was neglected for a considerable time before it was ready for the inspection of the court.

With Lord Mansfield's presidency, the practice introduced by him absolutely ceased, and the inconveniences just mentioned as resulting from the previous practice, have been renewed in a very aggravated degree. Great as Lord Kenyon's excellencies indisputably were, the impatience and irritability of his temper were a most serious disadvantage in the administration of justice; and nothing would have been more repugnant to his habits, than to have adopted the course of deliberately dictating a case as followed by his predecessor. In modern practice, as far as my observation goes, the reservation of a special case generally induces a cavil upon some verbal nicety upon some bye point, some collateral and incidental question, upon which a decision may be obtained of the particular case, independently of the general question which was the object of the case being reserved; and I cannot but think that this course has too frequently met with the encouragement of the courts, who have preferred resting upon the special ground of some incidental finding, to entering into the discussion of the general question intended to be reserved.

I am not equally prepared to join in the commendation of the learned writer on the law of insurance, in his panegyric on another alteration in the course of practice introduced under the auspices of Lord Mansfield; before whose time it is observed, that it wss almost a matter

of course not to decide any case without hearing two arguments upon it; bnt in the very first cause which is reported of his lordship's decisions, he expressed himself to this effect:— 44 When we have no doubt, we ought not to put the parties to the delay and expense of a further argument, nor leave other persons, who may be interested in the determination of a point of a general nature, unnecessarily under the anxiety of suspence.” Without insisting upon the expediency of allowing a second argument, merely as a matter of course, I do think it is tp be regretted, that that practice has been so very generally discontinued, and that the character of mere dispatch has been in modern times allowed to hold so high a place in the scale of judicial reputation. To every person of reflection and observation, many instances must occur, in which first impressions of very considerable force have yielded to the subsequent views, arising from a more enlarged and deliberate consideration: and perhaps it may not be unworthy of remark, that the case of Reynard and Chase, with which the general deviation from the preceding cases originated, * is one which by no means bears the character of undisputed rectitude of decision. In the greater part of the suggestions contained in the notes to the present work, the principal object in contemplation is, the obviating unnecessary expense or delay; but the most beneficial means of attaining that end are those which are supplied by such arrangements as may present the real object in dispute to the consideration of the court in the most easy and commodious manner, and defeat the artifices of chicanery and oppression. But some sacrifice is due to the object of producing such a decision upon an immediate case, as may have the effect of eliciting correct principles, for the future guidance of the profession and the public, and may prevent observations from having the character of authority, which, upon being fairly canvassed, would not be found to bear the test of examination. In the long list of cases which now occur at the beginning of every number of reports, where rules to anew cause why there, should not be new trials ire refused upon the first impression of the case, the instances are not unfrequent of points, which are at least of sufficient importance to merit a deliberate enquiry. The delay of a second argument, with the exception of the period of the long vacation, is not considerable; and there is no part of legal proceedings, in which the expense bears so small a proportion to the magnitude of the object, as a solemn argument. The strong conviction of the importance, which I have always felt and often expressed, of giving to every legal discussion of which the event might be material, as a precedent, that mature attention, which is the best security from error and misconception *

has recchred a material confirmation from the Tory laat number of reports that has hitherto reached me; wherein it is said by the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas («)—“ 1 am afraid there is no case from which, owing either to the fallibility of the judges who decided it, or some other cause, an argument like that which has now been made uae of might not be raised far die purpose of overturning the judgment.

1 dare say it almost always happens, that among the reasons given by the judges for their opinions, there is something dropped, either directly or collaterally, which, taken by itself,

Would be insufficient to support the decision: and formerly, I remember, provided the judgment, taken together, were sufficient, such circumstances would have passed unnoticed.’ *

The circumstance that it always or indeed often happens that something is dropped by judges which cannot be supported, cannot but be regarded as matter of regret, when it is recollected that, in forming an opinion upon the effect of a particular case, the general comae has been, not merely to look at the point decided, as standing alone and unaccompanied by the reasons of it, but to consider the reasons as incorporated with the decision; and although it is too much to expect that, in the mvthipttcity of judicial business, no opinion shall be expressed which Will not bear the teat of a critical examination, it is certainly extremely dedrable to avoid a course which usndare the expression of such opinions more probable than it would be, if the forming, as well us the expression of any judgment, were reservsd until the court were folly in possession of the view of the case which maybe presented by those who have made it the subject of previous attention'; and if the benefit of dispatch w*re more generally regarded as subordinate to the higher objects not only of coming to a correct decision of the particular question, but of rendering the grounds and motives of that decision so clear and explicit, as to afford a secure direction in aH subsequent cases affected by an analogy of principle.

But if a system of greater deliberation is desirable with respect to questions submitted to the solemn consideration of the courts, how much more important would it be to check the practice of ascribing the character of judicial authority to the sudden views of a subject which may be taken upon trials at nisi prim ! and how much is it to be regretted that collections of such opinions are allowed to occupy so Important a place in our juridical libraries, sad are introduced into some of our treatises as the ground of general propositions of law !

I apprehend that the profession are becoming duty vendible of this inconvenience; and some meant alluvions to the use which is made of

these decisions, by the learned judge opinion has last been quoted, may have a 1 ency to check a practice so injurious-to i rate discussion, and prevent an argument, supported by the correct principles of legal reasoning, from being overturned by the mere authority of a case in Mr. Peake or Mr. Espinasue. 1 sm glad to learn that, in a new edition of Comyns’s Digest undertaken by several learned members of the profession, a resolution has been taken not to admit of the introduction of any mtt print cases.

My own limited sphere of observation is almost entirely confined to this department of judicial business; and 1 have often moat sensibly felt the inconvenience which has resulted from indulging a spirit of anticipation, insteud of dispassionately attending to the suggestions, which, however imperfect, have not been busty or inconsiderate, intended to be offered on behalf of a party whose comfort or ruin might depend on the event; and the painful situation of an advocate Condemned to enter into a desultory combat with a judge, who, by the] mature expression of his opinion, may i acquire the feelings of a party to the < or, (which is still more distressing) reduced to relinquish the maintenance of rights which he is entrusted to support, and in favour of which he entertains a sincere opinion, founded upon laborious examination, in consequence of the agitation resulting from so unequal a contest. Whenever this practice prevails, it is obvious that the talent of snip-snap altercation, and the strength of lungs in a scramble for attention, are qualities of more importance than any previous application to the elucidation of the real merits of a cause.

Decisions at nisi prim are sometimes suffered to acquire an authority from the acquiescence of counsel of eminence, who have declined submitting the propriety of them to the revision of the court; but so many incidental motives of inconvenience, weariness, and expense may operate upon a party submitting to the first decision against him, that it is very seldom that this argument can be relied upon with an adequate confidence of Hs being well founded in point of fact; and even taking it at the highest; it has very little claim to be ranked in opposition to any immediate arguments upon the merits, which would otherwise be considered as entitled to* serious attention.—Connected with this observation is the influence sometimes ascribed to the tacit authority of a case, in which a point that afterwards becomes the subject of controversy was involved, according to the statement of the facts; but which passed unnoticed in the discussion of other questions to which the argument was particularly directed, and must have been takes for granted in

order to render the actual controversy at all material. To suppose that this arose from deliberate intention, and from a settled conviction that the point, if taken, would have been found untenable, is an assumption which is often at variance with the truth of the facta;

every person's experience will convince liim of the many instances in which he has entered into a controversy upon a collateral inquiry, which might have been prevented if a preliminary ground of argument had in proper time occurred to his attention. The objection of such tacit authorities can never be properly urged, when it is admitted that the point supposed to be involved in them would, if presented, have been fairly susceptible of doubt and controversy. Much less can it be entitled to prevail in opposition to what upon fair investigation may be found to be the true conclusion upon the subject, independently of such supposed authority.

jW observations were forcibly impressed ou my mind by the case of Isherwood r. Old-know, 3 M. & . 382., which turned upon the important question; whether an action of covenant could be maintained by a person in remainder upon a lease made by a tenant for life, under a power? and which certainly was open to very considerable discussion; out in winch considerable reliance was placed upon tile tacit authority of former cases, wherein the discussion had turned upon the conformity of leases to the power under which they possessed, in respect of covenants entered into by the leasee; and which covenants I admit would not have been very material, if it had not been taken for granted that an action could have been maintained upon them by the party in remainder:but the point so taken for granted certainly was attended with sufficient difficulty to render it manifest* that it had been rather overlooked in consequence of the attention being directed to another object, than abandoned upon deliberate consideration, as unworthy of argument.

Upon a case coming before a court of error or appeal, I had conceived it to be clear, that the question to be discussed would depend upon the propriety of the original judgment, as appearing upon the face of authentic proceedings, without reference to any statement of what passed in the original discussion; bat in Chamley v. Dnnaavy, in the house of Lords, 2 Schoales and Lefroy 690, an opinion is strongly expressed by Lord Redesdale and Lord Eldon, that upon an appeal in equity no point ought to be knade at the bar of the House, which was not made belOw, and which therefore may be considered as having been waved. If such waver can be collected from the course of the proceedings themselves, I am perfectly ready to accede to this view of the subject, and which, in many cases, may be fairly taken

upon cases in equity, as immediately arising on the proceedings, without being formally stated. But in the case 6f the King v. The West Riding of the County of York, 2 Dow P. C. 2., Lord Eldon seems to adopt the same principle, as applicable to a case arising upon a writ of error from a court of law; deducing the fact from the printed authority of the case as contained in East's Reports. No decision was pronounced upon the question, 'the objection being waved by the counsel. But the propriety of the doctrine alluded to certainly requires a very serious Consideration. Admitting that it would be an improvement in dim law if no objections could be made in a court of error or appeal, which was not formally put upon the record as a (ground of objection in the court below, I think it will reouhne much consideration, before it can be admitted that a court of error should give judgment, according to the existing state of the law, in favour of a proceeding confessedly erroneous. Waving the observation that many eases are allowed to pass without argument in the original court, with the express view of tailing the opinion of s court of error in the first instance, the great difficulty of the present question relates to the mode in which the fact, as to what objections were originally made, can be authentically ascertained; whether, in sage of an appeal to the House of Lords, it is to depend upon the memory of any noble lord who may have concurred in the original decision, so aa to make a distinction between the ease in which any such lord may be mu-sent, and others; whether a certificate naU be applied for* to the original court, as to the recollection of the arguments and prsessd-ings; whether the matter shall be open to suggestions, supported only by altercation and opposite statements at the bar, or whether the character of solemn authority shall he applied to any accidental publications, in which tits proceedings may have been reported for fit use of the profession. In the introduction of any novel practice by mere judicial authority, it is impossible to give too minute and extended a consideration to the oonsequeaess to which it may lead; and therefore I burn taken the liberty of submitting these observations to those who can best decide upon their propristy.

I am folly aware that in this note 1 hare dl-premed into tile examination of seven! subjects not arising out of the Statute to which they are attached, nor very intimately, connected with each other. But feeling that the subjects adverted to are in themselves intimately connected with the beneficial administration of the law, I have ventured td-trapaUi upon the patience of the public, by the discussion of them in that port of the Work which appeared to afibrd the fidnptt sppmrtn nity for their introduction.

[No. IV.] 1 Edward III. stat. 1. c. 4.—Trial of an

Averment in a Writ of false Judgment.

(1)1 have chosen to insert this obsolete statute, upon a supposition that at some future period it may be thought eligible to revive the institution which it prescribes, if not according to the literal precedent, by the adoption of a tribunal for the decision of questions of error and appeal, founded upon analogous principles. The overwhelming increase in every department of public business, judicial or parliamentary, requires a degree of application very greatly exceeding any that was requisite, not only at the time of the original establishment, but even within the memory of the present generation. In order to meet this increase of business with a suitable attention to convenience and dispatch, different arrangements have been from time to time made, and others will probably be rendered equally necessary. I do'not think that it would be desirable altogether to abolish the jurisdiction of the House of Lords, as an aggregate body, in matters of judicial appeal; and think it would be prefer able, if any establishment should be adopted of the nature suggested, to reserve a power by special order of hearing such cases at the bar of the house. It is notorious that the solemnity of that high tribunal, according to the existing practice, is attached rather to the place than to the course of proceeding, and that the majority of appeals from the three parts of the united Kingdom are in substance and effect to the Lord Chancellor individually; the presence of two other peers being necessary, but the particular individuals being in a constant course of fluctuation, even during the course of the particular cause; and that the motion of the Lord Chancellor is in effect the judgment of the case. At present a very honourable exception prevails to this practice, in the habitual attendance of a noble person, formerly holding an exalted judicial station, and whose legal

erudition is universally admitted to be of the highest degree. The same assistance would in all probability be afforded in case of a different arrangement being made, according to the idea at present suggested. I have only a recollection of two instances, in a period of upwards of thirty years, in which the judicial business of the House of Lords, in cases of appeal, ms considered as an object of general attention by the members of that body: the one was the well-known case of the Bishop of London r. Fytche, in which a decision took place contrary to the opinion of the majority of the judges, and contrary to what has been generally considered, independently of the direct authority of the judgment, as the true legal conclusion upon the subject: the other was as appeal from the Court of Chancery, respecting the appointment of a guardian; in the decision of which, so far as appeared from the diurnal publications, there was a greater admixture of personal and political feeling, than appears in the accustojned and ordinary administration of justice. There are some very important observations on this subject at the conclusion of Sir Matthew Hale’s valuable work on the Jurisdiction of* the Lords' ‘House of Parliament.

The value of the alteration in the judicial proceedings of the House of Commons, by the appointment of committees for the trial of controverted elections, is generally felt and admitted, as being one of the greatest improvements of the constitution in modern times. And I apprehend that the extension of a similar principle, not only to the judicial functions of the House of Lords, but to the legislative proceedings of both houses, upon subjects of s local and personal nature, would be attended with very beneficial consequences.

(1) Before the statute, “ when the submission to arbitration was by rule of court, which was often the case, the conduct of the arbitrators and of the parties to the submission might, as it still maybe, examined into, and if on examination it appeared that the arbitrators had been partial and unjust, or had mistaken the law, the court would not enforce a performance of the award; 1 Salk. 71, pi. 4.'; Anon. ibid. 73, Morris v. Reynolds, and Davila v. Almanza; ibid. 83, Forster r. Brunotti; 1 Mod. 21, Dar-byshire v. Cannon; 2 Bur. 701, Lucas v. Wilson. If, however, the conduct of the arbitrators was not or could not be successfully impeached, the Court of King's Bench, in the reign of Charles II., when Kelynge was Chief Justice, began to compel a performance of the award, by attachment, as for a contempt of a rule of court; 1 Salk. 83, Forster v. Bnmetti; Sid. 54, Stiles v, Triste. It afterwards became a common practice to issue out an attachment for nonperformance of an award; and it was found by experience, as the preamble of the

statute recites, that the enforcing of the performance of awards by attachment had contributed much to the ease of the subject."— Wms.'s Note to 1 Saund. 32?.

(2) In Lucas v. Wilson, 2 Bur. 702, it was held by the Court of B. R. that a submission entered into by rule of the court in a cause there depending, was not within the statute; but that it stood upon the common law, independent of the Act; which was made to put submission to arbitration in cases where there was no cause depending, upon the same foot as those where there was a cause depending. But here was a case depending at the time of the submission, and therefore the case was not within the provision of the Act; Pedley v. Westmacott, 3 E. 603.

(3) A case is within the Act, although the

agreement be to make the award instead of the submission a rule of court; Soilleux tv Herbst. 2 B. and P. 444; ----r. Mills, 17 Vescy, 419.

(2) It is competent for either party to revoke, by deed, his submission, .at any time before it is actually made a rule of cdurt; Milne v. Gr&trix, 7 E. 608. The doctrine, that submissions to award shall be subject to revocation, either expressly or by death, marriage, or other contingency, however firmly established, seems to have originated in a false principle, by which they are considered as a mere authority, instead of being regarded as an obligatory contract. It is agreed, that the obligation of a bond is not destroyed by such revocation, which, as long as the penalty was literally enforced, was an adequate security against such revocation; but since the determinations that upon these bonds it is requisite to assign breaches under stat. 8 and 9 Wm. III. c. 11.

s. 8. the remedy is in such cases much less efficacious. Where a feme sole submitted ta arbitration by deed, amt an award was made after her marriage, and an action brought against the husband and wife for non-performance, it was objected in arrest of judgment, that the marriage was a revocation; but it was held that such marriage, although a revocation, was itself a breach of the covenant to refer, in respect of which the action might be maintained, and therefore, that upon the whole declaration it appeared that the plaintiff had a good cause of action; Chamley *. Winstanley, 1 E. 266.

(3) No attachment can be granted for not paying a sum of money pursuant to an award, .without a personal demand, although the time and place of payment are directed by the award; Brandon r. Brandon, 1 J3. and P. 394. The court of C. P. refused to grant an attachment for non-performance of an award pending an action brought on the award, or to allow

the plaintiff to waive the action in order to apply for an attachment; Hadley *. Loasday, 1 B. and P.81.

(4) In Nicholas v. OhsHs, 14 Veasy, 266, Lord Eldon intimated the inclination of hit opinion that no. bill in equity could be sustained for an injunction against proceeding by attachment upon an award under the statute, and in Gwinett v. Bannister, Id. 630, expressly decided that the statute does prohibit the jurisdiction of a court of equity. In - Mills,

17 Vescy, the question was agitated, whether the jurisdiction of courts of equity is taken away in case the hill is filed previously to the submission being made a rule of court ? but the ease was determined upon collateral grounds. In Lord Lonsdale v. Littledale, 2 Veeey jnn. 451, a bill in equity was sustained where the award was made by a rule of court in a cause pending, and which of course was not a case within the statute'; and by Lord Eldon in Nicholas v. Chalie—“ It docs not appear even that there was the term imposed upon the party not to file a bill in equity; the effect of which has never been determined in a court of equity; but that case does not afford even that ground of objection, and is therefore no more than a rule of nisi print, by consent given in court, under an order of court, to abide an award. All the subsequent proceedings are nothing more than part of the transaction in the course of a suit at law." And upon mentioning the case a second time, his lordship said—* It has appeared extraordinary to those who have sat here, that courts of law should permit parties by contract upon such a reference to arbitration, to deprive themselves of the benefit which they might receive in equity." I cannot, however, help thinking, that courts of law in such cases proceed upon venr adequate grounds; the general object of submission to arbitration being to avoid the expense and protraction of litigation; and all equitable relief being given -in such cases by the summary interposition of the authority of the court of law in which the action is depending; and although such agreement may not

(1) The limitation does not extend to cases referred under orders of nisi prims t Anderson v. Coketer, 1 Str. 501; Synge v. Jervoise, 8 East, 486; although the statute only mentions corruption or undue practice, the application to aet aside an award within the statute, upon any other ground, must be made within the limited time; as where the application was on account of the arbitrator not having had sufficient materials; Zachary v. Shepherd, 2 T. R.

781. So where the defect appeared on the face of the award; Lowndes v. Lowndes, 1 E. 276.

In Holland v, Brookes, 6 T. R. 161, an application for an attachment for non-performance of an award was resisted on several grounds not appearing on the face of the award, but stated by affidavit, as that the arbitrator had not made his award within the time prescribed, and that the plaintiff had since the submission become a married woman: but the court were of opinion that the party could not object to an award for any defect not apparent on the award itself, in shewing cause against a motion for an attachment, and that he must obtain a rule for that purpose within the time limited by the Act.

This point appears to have been rather hastily decided, and to require farther consideration.

The making of the award within the limited time is a condition essentially attached to the submission; and it would seem necessary that in an application for an attachment, the compliance with such condition should be distinctly shewn in support of the application, for after the expiration of the term, the attempt to exercise the power of the arbitrator does not appear to be a matter of collateral objection, but a mere nullity. So if the- award is made after the submission is legally revoked, at in the case of marriage: and there certainly is nothing in the language of the Act itself to give effect to an award, if not made according to the contract and submission of the parties. At the time of deciding this case, it was not considered as settled that an attachment might be objected to on account of the apparent invalidity of the award, which, in a subsequent.case so decided, was stated by Lord Kenyon to be one of the most important questions that had

occurred since he had had a seat in the court; Pedley v. Goddard, 7 T. R. 73.

In Lucas v. Wilson, 2 Bur. 702, Lord Mansfield said, that the court will not enter at ill into the merits of the matter referred to arbi* tration, but only take into consideration such legal objections as appear upon the face of the award, and such objections as go to the conduct of the arbitrators. But Lord Eldon in Gwinett v. Bannister, 14 Vesey, 532, (evidently refer-line to this observation; says that some general dicfmqpon this subject'in Burrow are inaccurate. in Knox v. Symmonds, 1 Vesey, jun. 369, (which arose upon a reference of a cause in the Court of Chancery), Lord Thurlow said, “ A party to an award cannot come to hare it set aside upefti the simple ground of erroneous judgment in the arbitrator, for to his judgment they refer their disputes; and that would be a ground of setting aside every award. In order to induce the court to interfere, there must be something more, as corruption in the arbitrator, or gross mistake, either apparent upon the face of the award, or to be made out by eridence: but in case of mistake it ought to be made ont to the satisfaction of the arbitrator, and the party must convince him that his judgment was influenced by that mistake, and that if it had not happened he should have- made a different award.” In Morgan e. Mather, 2 Vesey, jun. 15, (being also the case of a reference of a cause depending in Chancery) the court, with reference to a question of allowing compound interest, refused to set aside the award, as there might be cases in which such allowance would be proper. Wilson, L. C. said—“ It would be a melancholy thing, if, because we differed from the arbitrators in points of fact, we should set aside awards. The only grounds for that are: first, that the arbitrators have awarded what was out of their power: secondly, corruption; or that they have proceeded contrary to the principles of natural justice, though there is no corruption; as, if without reason they will not hear a witness: thirdly, that they hare proceeded upon mere mistakes which they themselves admit. I am of opinion that where any thing is submitted to arbitration, the arbitrators cannot award contrary to law, because that is beyond their power; for the parties intend to submit to them only the legal consequences of their transactions and engagements.”

In Ching v. Ching, 6 Vesey, 282, upon an application to set aside an award, upon the allegation that the arbitrators bad made a wrong decision upon a question of law, Lord

Eldon —id—“ If a question of law is referred to an arbitrator, .he must decide upon it, and though, he decide wrong you cannot help it. In a case before Lord Rosslyn, Mr. Mansfield and I endeavoured to open an award on the ground of mistake of the arbitrator, the question referred being aa to the vesting of a legacy; but it was held we could not.”

In Kent v. Elstob, 3 East, 18, (arising on a reference at nisi prims) the arbitrator with his award delivered a paper containing reasons for his opinion, which appeared to proceed upon a mistaken view of the law, and the award was set aside, as he meant to determine according to the law, and had mistaken it; and that the reasons assigned should be taken to be the same as if inserted in the sward. Ching v. Ching was cited; but Lawrence J. said—“ The case appeared to be only a short note, and without knowing more of the circumstances of it he could not form any judgment upon the opinion said to have been there delivered, whether they applied or not.”

In the subsequent case of Young v. Walter, 9 Vesey, 364, a motion being made to prevent the execution of an award on account of a mistake by the arbitrator. Lord Eldon said— “ The Court of King’s Bench have lately quarrelled with a decision of Lord Rosslyn, followed by me upon this point. I confess I think those decisions right. If there is a question of law, and the parties choose to refer that to the decision of an arbitrator instead of the court, why may not he take all moral consideration’s into his judgment ? If they refer to a person to decide all matters in differcilce according to law, and he means to decide according to law, and mistakes, the court will set that right. But if a distinct question of law and nothing else is referred, as there was in the case before Lord Rossyln, and the parties choose to say they will not take the decision of the court, but will take whatever an arbitrator shall say is the law between them, why may they not so agree ?”

In Chace v. Westmore, 13 East, 357, upon a reference of causes depending to a gentleman at the bar, who made his award as well upon Use law as the fact, it was moved to set aside the award, on the ground of a mistake in point of law; but though the question of law was raised on the pleadings, it did not appear upon, the face of the award, but was brought before the court on affidavit. Upon, she wing cause. Lord EUenborough and the rest of the judges intimated great doubt whether they ought to enter into the merits of the decision. His Lordship observed, that there was a great difference in these cases in considering the object of the reference, and the description of the person to whom the decision was confided by the parties. In ordinary cases, where questions of fact are referred to one who is supposed to be competent to deal with such questions, though not with questions of law, and a

rsstion of law happens to arise, in which he turb8 the whole justice of the case, the court would, I think, enter into the inquiry, and correct what was erroneous in the decision. But, when a doubtful question of law arises between parties, it often happens that on that very account they agree to refer the matter to the arbitrament of a gentleman of the profession, meaning to refer the matter of law to him, and to abide by his. determination of It. After hearing counsel in support of the rule, his Lordship said, “ I fear it is impossible to lay down any general and certain rule upon this subject, in what cases the court will not suffer an award to be opened: it must be subject to' some degree of uncertainty, depending upon the circumstances of each case. But it is enough to say, that, in the present case, where the merits in Law and in fact were referred to a person competent to decide upon both, we will not open the award, unless it could be shewn to be so notoriously against justice, and his duty as an arbitrator, that we could infer misconduct on his part.” The other judges agreed; and Le Blanc J. added, “ that where the question of law necessarily arises upon the face of the award, then the court must take notice of it.”

In the subsequent case of Campbell v, Twem-low, in the Exchequer, 1 Price 81. which arose on a reference at nisi prims to the Editor of the present Work, a motion was made to set aside the award, on account of the rejection of a witness as incompetent. A great part of the discussion at the bar related to the question of law upon the point objected to; but the court held that it was unnecessary for them to give any opinion on that question, which they treated as a doubtful one. Thomson C. B. said, “ Every thing both of law and in fact must, in this instance, have been referred to the arbitrator. He has adjudged the case, and has decided on not calling this witness. Certainly, there have been many instances, where the courts have refused to interfere, on the ground of a mistake by an arbitrator in point of law. The case of Ching v. Ching goes precisely to that point Here, certainly, it was a question of law, whether the witness was admissible or not. There have been other cases where the arbitrator has prayed the aid of a court, and stated the grounds of his doubts on the face of the award; and there, certainly, the courts have interfered, and given an opinion. In Ives e. Medcalfe, 1 Atk. 63. a material document was shewn to one arbitrator only, and the other swore, that if he had seen it he believed he should not have made such an award. There, Lord Hardwickc held that

award was unfairly obtained, and on that ground decreed that it should be set aside; but be agreed to the general rule, that the arbitrators are judges of the parties' own choosing; and that, therefore, they cannot object to the award at an unreasonable judgment, or as a judgment against law."—The other judges concurred in the opinion that the award was conclusive.

In cases of partnership, and other relations of a permanent nature, i(is usual to insert a clause, that any matters of difference which may arise should be determined by arbitration:and in one case, Lord Kenyon, as Master of the Rolls, decided, that such an agreement might be pleaded in bar to a suit in equity; Half hide v. Fenning, 2 Brown C. C. 336; but this is contradicted by the general current of authorities both previous and subsequent. See Mitchell r. Hams, 2 Vesey jun. 129:4 Bro. Ch. 311; Kill v. Hollister, 1 Wils. 129; Street v. Rigby, 6 Vesey 815.

And in Tattersall v.Groote, 2 B. and P. 131, the Court of Common Pleas expressed a strong opinion that no action could be maintained for breach of a contract to submit to arbitration, on the ground of its being nugatory; and that it would be difficult to direct a jury upon what rule to proceed in assessing damages. The case was decided on other grounds, but the opinion in question seems to be very open to further examination; for, in general, if one person covenants absolutely with another for the performance of a given net, an action may be maintained for the non-performance of snen act, without shewing any interest in its being performed. The damages would in most cases b$ merely nominal; but it is easy to imagine a case in which, upon the subject in aucstion, Igrgc damages might be made out to the satisfaction of a jury; for instance, if the plaintiff should have obtained the decision of a court in his favour, and should have been put to considerable extra costs. But the difficulty or uncertainty of ascertaining the amount of damages can veiy seldom be admitted as a bar to the right of action.

But in Waters v. Taylor, 15 Vesey 10, (being the wcll-Juipwn case of dispute between, the proprietors of the Opera House) upon a motion for a receiver, the Lord Chancellor suggested the absolute necessity that the parties should go to arbitration, and also took the objection that the court does not interfere for the management of a joint concern, except as incidental to the object of the suit, to wind’up the concern and divide the profit. Ip the course of his judgment he made the following observations :—“ This is compared to the familiar case of a partnership. There is no. instance of on application for the purpose of putting f manager or receiver upon partnership property, where the court did not pause, from regard to the interest of the parties; putting it to them to consider whether they would, by a proper attention to their own interests, remove the necessity of doing that which, though it must be done when necessary, is at best a ruinous proceeding.*'—“ I that is the usual practice upon partnerships ix London, when the parties have not provide* that no such measure shall be adopted, without entering into the consideration how far those parties nave conclusively provided another remedy, such an intimation from the court is peculiarly wholesome if the parties have, upon the face of the instrument, demonstrated their conviction that a court of justice should not be hastily resorted to:especially if the nature of the subject is such that a judge, feeling himself bound to determine, must acknowledge that he cannot understand it; and the instruments which must decide upon the rights oi the parties betray their consciousness that nu judge could understand it."—“ The argument with reference to those provisions (the provisions of the particular deed) is, that the court can no more renounce the jurisdiction on account of the ridiculous or frivolous nature oi the dispute, than upon the most important point: but my argument is, that the forurj they have provided for themselves, and tit4 guard introduced by them against the forum of the country, (whether effectually I do not say) shew .their intention against the interference of any other jurisdiction, until they have tried the effect of the special means, provided by themselves; and that course which is familiar in the common case of partnership is more especially to be adopted tfherc the parties have themselves expressed that intention." —“ As n general proposition, it is true that an agreement to refer disputes to arbitration will not bind the parties even to submit to arbitration before they come into court. 1 would not, therefore, say, that the consequence of this* provision in the instrument is, that a suit cau-not be instituted without adding this qualification; that the court, if bound to administei relief, is fully justified in pausingbefore it takes, upon an interlocutory motion, a step that is in truth the greatest part of the relief.*—“ I am so strongly pressed by the consideration that, whatever view the parties themselves may take of the subject, they are calling down upon them an interposition, perhaps not the most ruinous, but that cannot take place without infinite mischief to all who may have any interest in the subject, that 1 shall give them no opportunity to pause, and consider whether they will press for my determination, or have their disputes determined by that more wholesome inode which they have themselves prolass XIV.]Miscellaneous Statutes respecting Civil Actions, £c.

Accordingly I thought it within m scope of my discretion to give the recom-endation that has been given in almost every ue where it was proposed to make this court ie manager of joint concerns, giving the pares an opportunity of preserving themselves

00 the ruin that must be the necessaxy con-quence of an active interference of the urt."—“ In the Instance of a partnership, if e partiefe cannot agree, each excluding the her, that state of circumstances, operating

1 a dissolution, puts an end to the partner-ip; and this court then interposes in this sy, that it will wind up the concern, and ih that view, will appoint a person to col--t and manage until an end can actually be it to the concern. So a manager of a West dia estate is appointed, not for the purpose carrying it on, but to enable the court to re relief when the cause shall be heard."—

1 The parties have still the Locus Peniientise, d if they will not settle their own interests, is immaterial whether the consequences all be produced by their own act or by ioe."

In Carlen v. Drury, 1 V. & B. 154., being application for the appointment of a re-iver, in a suit respecting a subscription iwery, Lord Eldon said :—“ This court is to be required on every occasion to take ' i management of every playhouse and brew-\ use in the kingdom:but if the case justifies interference of the court, it may appoiut ^nanager in the interim for the purpose of Riding up the concern."

Lord Eldon said, he did not collect an instance of a bill filed by one Joiner against the other praying an account ^t:fely and not a dissolution, proceeding on foundation that the partnership was to Hfjtinue. Sir Samuel Romilly admitted that jtfould be extremely difficult.to produce any ^iiority, but said be had a strong impression ^t he bad drawn such bills, observing that couliuuauce of the partnership is the rit’imd of the jurisdiction in equity, as if the tpfaersliip was determined, either party St proceed at law to have the account UL. 111.

taken before auditors. The Lord Chancellor observed the inconvenience, that if a partner can come in equity for an account merely, pending the partnership, there seemed to ne nothing to prevent his coming annually. And the marginal abstract of the case is, “ No relief upon a bill by one partner against another not praying a dissolution."

1 have thought it eligible to bring together the preceding citations, as indicating a state of the law with reference to a very important subject, which seems to stand very much in need of legislative interference. A general agreement to submit to arbitration the disputes which may arise between parties forming apermanent connection, is hela to be destitute or legal obligation. The resort to a court of justice to settle differences which can only be adequately adjusted by reference or accommodation, is contemplated as necessarily fraught with ruin. A salutary caution is Indeed held out to parties acting with fairness and integrity; but a most powerful engine of oppression is placed in the bauds of those who are actuated by improper motives; and the law, which io general derives its efficacy and advantage from the power to compel, is reduced to assume the language of recommendation—a language which has its due effect upon provisional advisers, but which a fraudulent party is authorized to contemn. A connection is entered into upon mutual engagements for its continuance and upon the duration of which, according to the fair spirit and intention of its original formation, the prosperity and ruin of a party may depend; but that party is disabled from asserting his legal rights with reference to such continuance, and can only have the aid of the law as connected with the object of its dissolution. The inconvenient extent to which the adoption of an opposite course would engross the time and attention of those entrusted with the administration of justice, is manifest and apparent; therefore, the rights and obligations, which in almost every other system of jurisprudence are a most peculiar object of attention, must be left to the mere support of personal confidence and integrity. The existence and magnitude of the evil thus stated are mauifest and indisputable. I am not prepared to suggest any particular remedy, by the institution and establishment of any summary mode of jurisdiction; although 1 have often contemplated the general principle of such an establishment as being calculated, with proper modifications, to produce a beneficial effect: and 1 apprehend that there would be considerable advantage, without any material difficulty, in giving effect to those positive stipulations, which are familiar in their occurrence, and almost essentially necessary in their application.

Statutes relating to Religion and Ecclesiastical Authority.

[No. I.] 35 Edward 1. st.1. c. 2. — Religious Persons shall send nothing to their Superiors beyond the Sea.

[No. II.] 25 Edward IIL st. 5. c. 22. — He that purchased a Provision in Rome for an Abbey, shall be out of the King's Protection, and any Man may do with him as with the King’s Enemy.

The Statutes referred to in this Division are very numerous, and their Contents are very material and important as matter of legal and political history. Considering the nature of this work, and the space which it already occupies. I have thought it eligible to insert only such Statutes as may still be considered as material in respect of their practical operation, with the exception of two of the ancient Statutes, which explain the object and meaning of the once important expression, Praemunire. The restrictions that still exist form the subject of a controversy which is still maintained with considerable warmth. Under the strong and long continued impression that those restrictions might be withdrawn, as inapplicable to the present state of the country, and unnecessary with regard to the interests and security of the established Church, I have so far entered into the controversy as to state the grounds of that impression, in a series of44 Letters on the Legal Disabilities of Roman Catholics and Dissenters, and the Dangers apprehended from their Removal.” — Ridgway, 1813; but I am aware that any investigation, partaking of the nature of political controversy would not be consistent with the design and character of this collection.

Commonalty of the said Realm, containing. That whereas the holy.

Church of England was founded in the Estate of Prelacy, within the Realm of England, by the said Grandfather and his Progenitors, and the Earls, Barons, and other Nobles of his said Realm, and their Ancestors,

to inform them and the People, of the Law of God, and to make Hos- pitalities, Alms, and other works of charity, in the Places where the Churches were founded, for the Souls of the Founders, their Heirs, and all Christians; and certain Possessions, as well in Fees, Lands, Rents, as in Advowsons, which do extend to a great Value, were assigned by the said Founders to the Prelates and other People of the holy Church of the said Realm, to sustain the same Charge, and especially of the Possessions which were assigned to Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, 4 Religious, and all other People of holy Church, by the Engs of the said

Realm, Earls, Barons, and other great Men of this Realm; the same

Engs, Earls, Barons, and other Nobles, as Lords and Advowees, have had and ought to have the Custody of such Voidances, and the Present- ments and the Collations of the Benefices being of such Prelacies.

adjudged, and considered. That the said Oppressions, Grievances, and Damages in the same Realm from henceforth should not be suffered in

any Manner. And now it is shewed to our Lord the King in this present Parliament holden at Westminster, at the Utas of the Purification of our

Lady, the five and twentieth Year of his Reign of England, and of France the twelfth, by the grievous Complaints of all the Commons of

his Realm, that the Grievances and Mischiefs aforesaid do daily abound,

to the greater Damage and Destruction of all his Realm of England,

more than ever were before, viz. that now or late the Bishop of Rome, by

Procurement of Clerks and otherwise, hath reserved, and doth daily

reserve to his Collation, generally and especially, as well Archbishopricks,

Bishopricks, Abbeys, and Priories, as all other Dignities and other Church and reBenefices of England, which be of the Advowry of People of holy serveth the

Part of the Treasure of the said Realm is carried away and dispended

out of the Realm, by the Purchasers of such Benefices and Graces aforesaid; and also by such privy Reservations many Clerks advanced in this

Realm by their true Patrons, which have peaceably holden their Advancements by long Time, be suddenly put out: Whereupon the said

Commons have prayed our said Lord the King, that sith the Right of the

Crown of England and the Law of the said Realm is such, that upon the

Mischiefs and Damages which happen to his Realm, he ought, and is bound by his Oath, with the Accord of his People in his Parliament,

Men and the Commonalty of the said Realm, to the Honour of God, and Profit of the said Church of England, and of all his Realm, hath ordered and established, That the free Elections of Archbishops, Bishops, and all other Dignities and Benefices elective in England, shall hold from henceforth in the Manner as they were granted by the King’s Progenitors, and the Ancestors of other Lords, Founders of the said Dignities and other Benefices. And that all Prelates and other People of holy Church, which have Advowsons of any Benefices of the King’s Gift, or of any of his Progenitors, or of other Lords and Donors, to do Divine Services, and other Charges thereof ordained, shall have their Collations and Presentments freely to the same, in the Manner as they were enfeoffed by their Donors. And in case that Reservation, Collation, or Provision be made by the Court of Rome, of any Archbishoprick, Bishoprick, Dignity, or other Benefice, in Disturbance of the free Elections, Collations, or Presentations aforenamed, that at the same Time of the Voidance, that such Reservations, Collations, and Provisions ought to take Effect, our Lord the King and hi9 Heirs shall have and enjoy for the same Time the Collations to the Arch-bishopricks and other Dignities elective, which be of his Advowry, such a9 his Progenitors had before that free Election was granted, since that the Election was first granted by the King’s Progeriitors upon a certain Form and Condition, as to demand Licence of the King to cnuse, and after the Election to have*his Royal Assent, and not in other Manner; which Conditions not kept, the Thing ought by Reason to resort to his first Nature.

IV. And if any such Reservation, Provision, or Collation be made of any House of Religion of the King’s Advowry, in Disturbance of free Election, our Sovereign Lord the King, and his Heirs, shall have for that Time the Collation to give this Dignity to a convenient Person. And in case that Collation, Reservation, or Provision be made by the Court of Rome, of any Church, Prebend, or other Benefices, which be of the Advowry of People of holy Church, whereof the King is Advowee Paramount immediate, that at the same time of the Voidance, at which time the Collation, Reservation, or Provision ought to take Effect as afore is said, the King and his Heirs thereof shall have the Presentment or Collation for that Time. And so from time to time, whensoever such People of holy Church shall be disturbed of their Presentments or Collations, by such Reservations, Collations, or Provisions, as afore is said; saving to them the Right of their Advowsons and their Presentments, when no Collation or Provision of the Court of Rome is thereof made, where that the said People of holy Church shall or will to the same Benefices present or make Collation; and that their Presentees may enjoy the Effect of their Collations or Presentments. And in the same manner every other Lord, of what Condition that he be, shall have the Collations or Presentments to the Houses of Religion which be of his Advowry, and other Benefices of holy Church which be pertaining to the same Houses. And if such Advowees do not present to such Benefices within the half Year after such Void-ances, nor the Bishop of the Place do not give the same by Lapse of Time within a Month after half a Year, that then the King shall have thereof the Presentments and Collations, as he hath of other of his own Advowry. And in case that the Presentees of the King, or the Presentees of other Patrons of holy Church, or of their Advowees, or they to whom the King, or such Patrons or Advowees aforesaid, have given Benefices pertaining to their Presentments or Collations, be disturbed by such Provisors, so that they may not have Possession of such Benefices by virtue of the Presentments or Collations to them made, or that they which be in Possession of such Benefices, be impeached upon their said Possessions by such Pro visors; then the said Provisors, their Procurators, Executors, and Notaries, shall be attached by their Body, and brought in to answer; and if they be convict, they shall abide in Prison without being let to Main-prize or Bail, or otherwise delivered, till that they have made Fine and jiansom tp the King at his Will, and Gree to the Party that shall feel

And nevertheless before that they be delivered, they shall make full Renunciation, and find sufficient Surety that they shall not attempt such Things in Time to come, nor sue any Process by them, nor by other, against any Man in the Court -of Rome, nor in any part elsewhere, for any such imprisonments or renunciations, nor any other thing depending of them.

V. And in case that such Provisors, Procurators, Executors, or Notaries be not found, that the exigent shall run against them by due process, and that Writs shall go forth to take their bodies in what parts they be found, as well at the King’s suit, as at the suit of the party, and that in the mean time the King shall have the profits of such Benefices so occupied by such Provisors, except Abbeys, Priories, and other houses, which have Colleges or Covents, and in such Houses the Colleges and Covents shall have the profits; saving always to our Lord the King, and to all other Lords, their old right. And this Statute shall have place as well of reservations, collations, and provisions made and granted in times past against all them which have not yet obtained corporal possession of the Benefices granted to them by the same reservations, collations, and provisions, as against all other in tune to come. And this Statute oweth to hold place and to begin at the said Utas.

conspiracies and practices, as evidently appears by that more than barbarous and horrible attempt to have blown up with gunpowder the

King, Queen, Prince, Lords and Commons in the House of Parliament

assembled, tending to the utter subversion of the whole State, lately undertaken by the instigation of Jesuits and Seminaries, and in advancement of their religion, by their Scholars taught and instructed by thenr 9 to that purpose, which attempt by the only goodness of Almighty God was

discovered and defeated: And where clivers persons popishly affected, 9 do nevertheless, the better to cover and hide their false hearts, and with

by prorogation at Westminster in the three and twentieth year of the

reign of the late Queen Elizabeth, intituled, An Act to retain the Subjects

of the said late Queen in their due Obedience. It was amongst other

tilings enacted by authority of the said Parliament, That every person

above the age of sixteen years, which should not repair to some Church, € Chapel, or usual place of Common Prayer, but forbear the same contrary to the tenor of a Statute made in the first year of the reign of the

said late Queen, for uniformity of Common Prayer, and being thereof

lawfully convicted, should forfeit to the said Queen, for every month € after the end of the Session of Parliament which he or she should so

forbear, twenty pounds of lawful English money, as in and by the said

Act of Parliament more at large appeareth: *

XI. And whereas afterward by another Act of Parliament of the said Queen, it was further enacted by the authority of the said Parliament (amongst other things) how and when the said payments of the said twenty pounds should be made, and that if default should be made in

any part of any payment of the said twenty pounds, contrary to the € form in the said last specified Statute limited, that then and so often the € said Queen should and might by process out of her Highness* Exchequer f take, seize and enjoy all the goods, and two parts as well of all the

and hereditaments, leases and farms, to and for the maintenance and relief of the same Offender, his wife, children and family, as in and by the last specified Statute more at large also may appear: Now forasmuch as the said penalty of twenty pounds monthly is a greater burden unto men of small living, than unto such as are of better ability, and

do refuse to come unto Divine Service, as aforesaid, who rather than they will have two parts of their lands to be seized, will be ready always to pay the said twenty pounds according to the limitation of the said Statutes, and yet retain the residue of their livings and inheritance in their own hands, being of great yearly value, which they do for the most

part employ (as experience hath taught) to the maintenance of superstition and Popish religion, and to the relief of Jesuits, Seminaries,

Popish Priests, and other dangerous persons to the State; Therefore to

the intent that hereafter the penalty for not repairing to Divine Service

might be inflicted in better proportion upon men of great ability; * Be it enacted by the authority of this present Parliament, That the King's Majesty, his heirs and successors, shall from and after the Feast of St. Michael the Archangel next coming after the end of this Session of Parliament, have full power and liberty to refuse the penalty of twenty

Eounds a month, though it be tendered ready to be paid according to the aw, and thereupon to seize and take to his own use, and the uses, intents and purposes hereafter limited, two parts in three parts to be divided, as well of all the lands, tenements and hereditaments, leases and farms that at the time of such seizure shall be, or afterwards shall come to any of the said Offenders in not coming to Church, or any other to his or her use, or in trust for him or her, or at his or her disposition, or whereby or wherewith, or in consideration whereof, such Offender or his family, or any of them, shall be relieved, maintained or kept, as of all other lands, tenements, and hereditaments in any wise or at any time liable to such seizure, or to the Penalties aforesaid, and the same to retain to his own and other uses, intents, and proposes hereafter in this Act appointed, till every such Offender shall conform him or herself respectively as aforesaid, in lieu and full riecompence of the twenty pounds monthly, that during his such seizure and retainer shall’incur; any thing in the said Statutes, or any of them, or any other Statute, to the contrary, in any wise notwithstanding: Saving to our Sovereign Lord the King’s Majesty, his heirs and successors, and all and every Person and Persons, Bodies Politick and Corporate, their heirs and successors, (other than the said Offender, his or her heirs, and all claiming to his or their use, or in trust for hhn or them, or at his or their wijlu^ disposition) all and all manner of leases, rents, conditions, and other rights and titles whatsoever had, made, and done, bond fide, and without fraud and covin, before such seizure.

XII. Provided always, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the King’s Majesty, his heirs and successors, shall not take into his two parts, but leave to such Offender, his chief Mansion-house, as part of his third part, and shall not demise, lease, nor put over the said two parts, nor any part thereof, to any Recusant, nor to or for the use of any Recusant: And that whosoever shall take the same in lease, or otherwise, of his Majesty, his heirs and successors, shall give 6uch security not to commit, nor suffer waste to be committed, in or upon any the said Premises, as by the Court of Exchequer shall be allowed sufficient.

XXVII. And be it further enacted, That if any subject of this Realm at any time after one month next after the end of this present Session of Parliament, shall not resort or repair every Sunday to some Church, Chapel, or some other usual place appointed for Common Prayer, and there hear Divine Service according to the Statute made in that behalf, in the first year of the reign of the late Queen Elizabethr That then it shall and may be lawful to and for any one Justice of Peace of that Limit, Division, or Liberty, wherein the said Party shall dwell, upon proof unto him made of such default by confession of the party or oath of witness, to call the said party before him; an4 if he or she shall not make a sufficient

to the Churchwarden of the said parish, wherein the said party shall dwell, 3 James 1. under his hand and seal, to levy twelvepence for every such default, by c. 4. distress and sale of the goods of every such Offender, rendering to the said Offender the overplus of the money raised of the said goods so to be Forfeiture for sold: And that in default of such distress, it shall and may be lawful for not repairing the said Justice of Peace to commit every such Offender to some Prison to Church within the said shire, division, limit, or liberty, wherein such Offender shall weeluy* be inhabiting, until payment be made of the said sum or sums so to be forfeited: whidi forfeiture shall be employed to and for the use of the poor of that parish wherein the Offender shall be resident or abiding at the time of such Offence committed.

(1) The repressing occasional Conformity, as provided for by the repealed Sections of this Act, was the subject of very considerable controversy during the whole reign of Queen Anne. A Bill for the purpose was brought in in the first year of the reign. With reference to the Bill and a conference upon it between the Houses, some arguments had been advanced in the case of Harrison and Evans— upon which Lord Chief Justice Witmot observed, that both the Bill and the conference proceeded from a factious party spirit in both Houses, where questions were started and tossed about from one side to the other without considering the relevancy of them, but only how far they could annoy and perplex one another. — Reports, 159.

A similar Bill passed the Commons in 1705, but was rejected by the Lords, upon a debate which the Queen went to hear.

The Statute 10 Anne passed both houses without opposition; and in those days, Great rejections were made on the fate of this Bill which had formerly been so much contested, and was so often rejected by the Lords, and now went through both Houses in 15

so silent a manner, without the least opposition. Some of the Dissenters complained much that they were thus forsaken by their friends, to whom they had trusted, and the Coart had agents among them to inflame their resentments, since they were sacrificed by those on whom they depended. All the excuse that the Whigs made for their easiness in the matter was, that they gave way to it, to try how far the Yielding it might go towards quieting the fears of those who seemed to think the Church was still in danger till that Act passed; and thereby to engage these to concur with them in those important matters that might come before them. It must be left to time to shew what good effect this Act may have on the Church, or what bad ones it may have on Dissenters/’ (2 Burnet, 586.) The Statute 5 George I. c. 4. which repealed these Provisions, contains the Enactment against any mayor or other magistrate attending any meeting, other than of the Established Church, in the gown or other peculiar habit, or attendedwith the ensigns of office; and the Act has therefore been already in* serted under the title Corporations.

PART V.

CLASS II.

Treason and other Offences affecting the State.

The Statutes relating exclusively to the coin are in the succeeding class: the titles of those whereby treasons were created in respect of the Roman Catholic religion have been referred to under Class I. I have thought it desirable to include a reference to statutes respecting treason repealed by the general operation of 1 Mary, st. l.c. 1.; and also to tome of the temporary statutes of Mary and Elizabeth, on account of their importance in an historical point of view. It has not appeared requisite to attempt any digest, by way of notes, of the decisions that have taken place with respect to high treason; as, where any occasion occurs for the practical application of this branch of the laws, there is always abundant opportunity for preparation, and the law upon the subject is fully collected in several books of established reputation. But, upon the doctrine of constructive treason, I would strongly recommend the perusal of the very learned and judicious observations of Mr. Luders, in the first volume of his Law Tracts; a work which, for extent of information, accuracy of judgment, and interesting discussion, is entitled to a very high rank in the estimation of all who may be disposed to direct their attention to the study of jurisprudence as a rational science. To the following observations, arising from the impu-which may frequently take place in

consequence of the nice distinctions between treason and other offences of an inferior nature, I entirely subscribe.

The present method of trial in high treason sometimes gives an unfair advantage to the real and most dangerous criminal. Before the Act of King William, the advantage was on the side of the prosecution; and so tyrannically executed, in general, as to have given occasion to the contrary extreme in the new law. This evil is most likely to occur in the case of those popular commotions out of which the constructive treason of levying war is drawn. If those who direct a prosecution for treason in such cases think proper to risk the benefit of public justice by so doing, let them take the consequences; but 1 would have them allowed a choice, and the use of their discretion. Therefore, if the fear of change should operate to prevent any legislative alteration of the law of treason, there seems an easy course to begin with the following measure, which would make the least change possible, viz.:—Let no defendant indicted for felony or misdemeanour be allowed to object that his case amounts to a higher crime. Some state prosecutions for treason have been justified by the argument, that they could not be instituted for less. This alteration would allow a discretion to those whom it concerns, Tracts, vol, 1, p. 134.

Class II.] Treason, , fyc.c. 61

[Not I.] 25 Edward III. stat. 5. c. 2—A Declaration

which Offences shall be adjudged Treason.

ITEM, whereas divers opinions have been before this time in what case No. I.

Treason shall be said, and in what not; ' 4 the -King, at the request of the 23 Edw. III. 4 Lords and of the Commons, hath made a Declaration in the manner as

hereafter followeth; that is to say, When a man doth compass or imagine the death of our Lord the King, or of our Lady his Queen, or of

their eldest son and heir; or if a man do violate the King’s companion,

or the King’s eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the King’s eldest

son and heir; or if a man do levy war against our Lord the King in his Realm, or be adherent to the King’s enemies in his Realm, giving to them aid and comfort, in the Realm, or elsewhere, and thereof be provably attainted of open Deed by the people of their condition. And if a man counterfeit the King’s Great Or Privy Seal, or his money; and if a man bring false money into this Realm, counterfeit to the money of England,

as the money called Lushburgh, or other like to the said money of England, knowing the money to be false, to merchandize or make payment,

in deceit of our said Lord the King and of his people; and if a man slea the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the King’s Justices of the one Bench, or the other. Justices in Eyre, or Justices of Assize, and all other justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their places, doing their offices.

And it is to be understood, that in the cases above rehearsed, that ought

to be judged Treason which extends to our Lord the King, and his Royal jjhe Majesty:And of such Treason the forfeiture of the escheats pertaineth f^re

to our Sovereign Lord, as well of the lands and tenements nolden of Offender’s 4 other, as of himself. And moreover there is another manner of Treason, Lands in High that is to say, when a servant slayeth his master, or a wife her husband, Treason.

or when a man secular or religious slayeth his prelate, to whom he oweth Petit Treason. 4 faith and obedience; and of such treason the escheats ought to pertain to every lord of his own fee. And because that many other like cases of Treason New Ques- may happen in time to comeK which a man cannot think nor declare at this tions of Trea- present time; it is accorded. That if any other case, supposed Treason, sen shall first which is not above specified, doth happen before any Justices, the Justices decided in shall tarry without any going to judgment of the Treason till the Cause be Parliament.

skewed and declared before the King and his Parliament, whether it ought to be judged Treason or other Felony. And if percase any man of this Realm, ride armed covertly or secretly, with men of arms against any other, to slay him, or rob him, or take him, or retain him till he hath made fine or ransom for to have his deliverance, it is not the mind of the King nor his Council, that in such case it shall be judged Treason,

but shall be judged Felony or Trespass, according to the Laws of the

land of old time used, and according as the case requireth. And if in such case, or other like, before this time any Justices have judged Treason, and for this cause the lands and tenements have come into the Kin^s hands as forfeit, the chief lords of the fee shall have the escheats of the tenement holden of them, whether that the same tenements be in the King’s hands, or in others, by gift or in other manner; saving always to our Lord the King the year, and the waste,

and the forfeitures of chattels, which pertain to him in the cases above named; and that the writs of Scire facitu be granted in such case against the land-tenants without other original, and without allowing the protection of our Lord the King, in the said Suit; and that of the lands which be in the King’s hands, writs be granted to the Sheriff of the counties where the lands be, to deliver them out of the King’s hands without delay. ’

ITEM, Whereas the Commons have complained them of escheators,

1 which by colour of their office have seised divers lands and tenements as forfeit to the King for Treason surmised in dead persons, which were never attainted of Treason in their lives, the King thereof hath good regard; but because he and his progenitors have been seised of the forfeitures of warn of all times, the King will not exclude himself of such right, whereof he found his Crown seised, and will continue his right of

such forfeitures fallen in his time, and in the time of his father, in the manner as hath been used.’ 4 Nevertheless, of his special grace he-will

and granteth, That of such forfeitures fallen in the time of his grandfather, 4 and all his progenitors before, as soon as an inquest shall be thereof returned in the Chancery by the escheators, or other which have power to inquire, that the tenant shall not be put out of his possession, but shall be warned by Scire facias, to be at a certain day to answer to his Scire facias, if he will. And if any such forfeiture be now, or shall be seised of the same time, that the King’s hand shall be out thereof; so always, 4 that in all other cases of forfeiture for Treason of dead persons not at- tainted or judged in their lives, their heirs, nor their land-tenants shall not be impeached nor challenged, nor of any other forfeiture, except the forfeitures in old time judged after the death of the persons by present- ment in Eyre, or in the King's Bench, as of Felons of themselves and other.

the destruction of the King’s, and the undoing of this Realm; so as it

hath appeared evidently, when compassing of the death of such as were of the King’s true Subjects was had, the destruction of the Prince was

imagined thereby, and for the most part it hath grown and been occasioned by envy and malice of the King’s own household servants, as now

of late such a thing was likely to have ensued; and forasmuch as by the Law of this land, if actual deeds be not had, there is no remedy for such

false compassings, imaginations, and confederacies had against any Lord,

Be it therefore enacted, by the Assent and Consent of our Sovereign Lord the King, and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That if any person or persons, after the first day of February next coming, do maliciously wish, will or desire, by Words or Writing, or by Craft, imagine, invent, practise or attempt any bodily harm to be done or committed to the King’s most Royal Person, the Queen’s, or their Heirs apparent, or to deprive them or any of them of their Dignity, Title or Name of their Royal Estates, or slanderously and maliciously publish and pronounce, by express Writing or Words, that the King our Sovereign Lord should be Heretick, Schismatick, Tyrant, Infidel, or Usurper of the Crown, or rebelliously do detain, keep or withhold from our said Sovereign Lord, his Heirs or Successors, any of his or their Castles, Fortresses, Fortilessea, or Holds within this Realm, or in any other the King’s dominions or

Marches, -or rebelliously detain, keep or withhold from the King’s said Highness, his Heirs or Successors, or any of his or their Ships, Ordinances, Artillery, or other Munitions or Fortifications of War, and do not humbly render and give up to our said Sovereign Lord, his Heirs or Successors, or to such persons as shall be deputed by them, such Castles, Fortresses, Fortilesses, Holds, Ships, Ordinances, Artillery, and other Munitions and Fortifications of War, rebelliously kept or detained, within six days next after they shall be commanded by our said Sovereign Lord, his Heirs or Successors, by open Proclamation under the Great Seal; that then every such person and persons so offending in any the premises, after the said first day of February, their Aiders, Counsellors, Consenters and Abettors, being thereof lawfully convict according to the Laws and Customs of this Realm, shall be adjudged Traitors, and that every such Offence in any of the premises, that shml be committed or done after the said first day of February, shall be reputed, accepted and adjudged High Treason, and the Offenders therein and their Aiders, Consenters, Counsellors and Abettors, being lawfully convict of any such Offence as is aforesaid, shall have and suffer such Pains of Death and other Penalties, as is limited and accustomed in cases of High Treason.

III. And to the intent that all Treasons should be the more dread, hated and detested to be done by any person or persons, and also because it is a great boldness and an occasion to ill-disposed persons, to adventure and embrace their malicious Intents and Enterprizes, which all true Subjects ought to study to eschew: Be it therefore enacted, by the Authority aforesaid, That none Offender in any kinds of High Treasons, whatsoever they be, their Aiders, Consenters, Counsellors, nor Abettors, shall be admitted to have the Benefit or Privilege of any manner of Sanctuary, considering that matters of Treasons touch so nigh both the surety of the King our Sovereign Lord’s person, and his Heirs and Successors.

IV. And over that, be it enacted, by Authority aforesaid, That if any of the King’s Subjects, Denizens or other, do commit or practise out of the Limits of this Realm, in any outward Parties, any such Offences, which by this Act are made, or heretofore have been made Treason, that then such Treasons, whatsoever they be, or wheresoever they shall happen so to be done or committed, shall be inquired and presented by the Oaths of twelve good and lawful men, upon good and probable Evidence and Witness, in such Shire and County of this Realm, and before such persons as it shall please the King’s Highness to appoint by Commission under his Great Seal, in like manner and form as Treasons committed within this Realm have been used to be inquired of and presented; and that upon every Indictment and Presentment found and made of any such Treasons, and certified into the King’s Bench, like Process and other circumstance shall be there had and made against the Offenders, as if the same Treasons, so presented, had been lawfully found to be done and committed within the Limits of this Realm. And that all processes of Outlawry hereafter to be had and made within this Realm against any Offenders in Treason, being resiant or inhabited out of the Limits of this Realm, or in any of the Parties beyond the Sea, at the time of the Outlawry pronounced against them, shall be as good and as effectual in the Law to all intents and purposes, as if such Offenders had been resident and dwelling within this Realm at the time of such Process awarded, and Outlawry pronounced.

V. And be it further enacted, by Authority aforesaid, That every Offender and Offenders, being hereafter lawfully oonvict of any manner of High Treasons, by Presentment, Confession, Verdict, or Process of Outlawry, according to the due Course and Custom of the common Laws of this Realm, shall lose and forfeit to the King’s Highness, his Heirs and Successors, all such Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, which any such Offender or Offenders shall have of any Estate of Inheritance in Use or Possession* by any Right, Title or Means, within this Realm of England, or elsewhere within any of the King’s Dominions, at the time of any such Treason committed, or any time after; saving to every person and persons,

(1) This includes the Caption; 1 East, ch. 2. § 50.

(2) These privileges do not extend to collateral issues; 1 East. ch. 2. § 48.

(3) As to the mode of proceeding for the purpose of assigning Counsel, see 1 East. ch. 2. §51.

(4) Upon a joint indictment against several, each is entitled to two Counsel, l East. Ch. 2. § 48. I believe it is not usual to allow the Prisoner to have the assistance of mojre than two Counsel in examining witnesses, or arguing questions of law:—but Q. if this view of the subject is correct. It is now the established course to allow the assistance of an indefinite number of Counsel for these purposes in cases of Felony, and the present Statute was intended for the benefit of the accused. The allowing addresses to the Jury by an unlimited number of Counsel, might be attended with inconvenience; bat none such

can arise from an arrangement for the successive examination of witnesses by several different Counsel; whereas, on the other hand, the confining this part of the duty to two individuals, may, in some cases, as in the trials in 1794, be attended with such fatigue, as to occasion no inconsiderable personal detriment. For the argument of mere questions of law, I conceive that the Prisoner is entitled to the assistance of Counsel, dejure, and that there is nothing in the Statute to abridge such right.

(5) Two witnesses are not necessary with respect to a collateral fact, such as the party being a natural born subject; 1 East. ch. 2* $65.

(6) The proof by two witnesses of an extrajudicial confession, appears to be sufficient to satisfy the Act; subject to all observations as to the effect of such evidence; see l East. P. C. ch. 2. § 66.

Class II.] Tr<ason, ?e.

of Societies established for seditions and treasonable Purposes, and for better preventing treasonable and seditions Practices: And whereas, in and by

the twenty-seventh and thirty-fifth sections of the said Act, certain provisions were made, that every person who should print any paper or book,

or publish or disperse, or assist in publishing or dispersing, any printed

paper or book, without the name and place of abode of the printer being

printed on such paper or book, in such manner as by the said Act is specified, should forfeit and pay the sum of twenty pounds for every copy of

such paper so published or dispersed by him; to be recovered before any

justice or justices of the peace, for the county, stewartry, riding, city,

town or place, in which such penalty should be incurred: And whereas

there is not in the said Act any provision authorizing such justice or justices to mitigate the penalties thereby incurred, or enabling the party to appeal from .any conviction by or judgment of such justice or justices:

And whereas divers books and papers have since been printed by several

persons, who, through inadvertency or mistake, have neglected to comply with the provisions of the said Act, and such persons have thereby become liable to be sued and prosecuted for penalties to a vast amount,

although such books and papers were not of an evil or seditious tendency:

And whereas it is expedient to limit the amount of penalties imposed by

the said Act; and to enable magistrates to mitigate the penalties in such

cases as shall appear to them expedient; and also to give the party, who may be aggrieved by a conviction under such Act, a power of appealing

from the sameBe it therefore enacted by the King’s most excellent

Majesty, by and with- the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Printing pa-Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by pers or books the authority of the same, That notning in the twenty-seventh section of contrary to the said Act contained shall extend to make any person or persons offend- recited Act. ing against the same, liable to more than twenty-five forfeitures or penal- Penalties, ties for printing or publishing, or dispersing, or assisting in publishing or dispersing, any number of copies of one and the same paper or book, contranr to the said section of the said Act.

II.

III. And whereas doubts have arisen whether the provisions contained in

the said Act may not be considered as extending to notes and post bills of the governor and company of the bank of England, and to bills of exchange, promissory notes, bonds and other securities for payment of money, bills of lading, policies of insurance, letters of attorney, transfers or assignments of public stocks, funds and other securities, and to dividend warrants, receipts for money or goods, deeds or other instruments, proceedings in the courts of Law and Equity, and other inferior courts, warrants, orders and other papers, printed by the authority of any public board or public officer in the execution of the duties of their respective offices, many of which securities, instruments, proceedings

for the said Mints and fellowship of goldsmiths, for the amendment of

money and plate of the realm, that every thing might be reformed to the right standard, as well in money as plate, to the least cost, for the weal of

the King’s noblemen of the land, and common people: But so it is now,

that such finers and parters of gold and silver by fire and water, dwelling

abroad in every place of this realm out of the rules aforesaid, and buy

gilt silver from the mints, changes, and goldsmiths, and part and fine it as is aforesaid, and for the most part of the silver so fined, they do allay it in divers manners, and sell it at their pleasures to every man of what estate or degree soever he be, that will buy of them, to make such works as pleaseth the buyers; therefore men can get no fine silver when they need it for their money, for the amendment of money and plate, as hath

been in times past; wherefore it causeth money and plate in divers places of the realm to be made worse in fineness than it should be, as it appeareth evidently in divers places, to the great hurt of the King’s noblemen of the land, and common peopleWherefore the King our sovereign lord, by the assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and of the Commons, in the said Parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, hath ordained, enacted, and established.

Also all such fine silver as shall be parted and fined as is aforesaid, that it be made so fine, that it may bear twelve penny weight of allay in a pound weight, and yet it be as good as sterling, and rather better than

Foster continued to retain the sante opinion. An indfctment may be for possessing a mould, which is one of the articles mentioned in the preceding part of the section, without stating it to be a tool or instrument. The allegation of its being a mould, on which was impressed the similitude of a shilling, was held to be sufficiently proved, although the evidence was of a mould on which the resemblance of one of the sides of a shilling was inverted: although the judges thought it would have been more accurate to have described it as a figure which would make the figure of one of the sides of a shilling; Leonard’s Case, 1 E. P. C. c. 4. § 17. Upon an indictment for possession of

puncheons, upon which, as stated In the first count, were impressed the figure, &c. of the head side of a shilling, and, as stated in the second count, which could make and impress the figure, &c.; it was proved that the puncheon consisted of a shillingcut away to the outline of the head, and fixed upon a piece of steel cut close to the outline, without letters; which puncheon makes the die or counterpuncheon; and which puncheon alone, without the die or counter-puncheon, would not make the figure: Ruled, that the case was sufficiently proved; as the puncheon would, by means of the counter-puncheon, make the figure; and that it was not necessary that it should be an exact figure, but if the instrument would impress a resemblance in point of fact, such as would impose upon the world, it was sufficient, whether the letters were apparent on the puncheon or not. It was also agreed, that it was not necessary to prove that money had been actually made with the instrument; Ridgeley’s Case, 1 E. P. C. c. 4. §'18. In Welch’s Case, Leach, 293, 1 E. c.4. § 13, it was ruled, that an indictment for counterfeiting the likeness of a shilling was supported by proof of a blank, without any impression, being found by the jury to be of the likeness and similitude; and from Ridgeley’s

In Varley’s Case, 2 BI. Rep. 632, it was ruled, that an irregular piece, not rounded so as to be in a state to pass current, was incomplete, and did not amount to a counterfeiting.

"WHEREAS the preventing the currency of dipt and unlawfully dimi?

the coin of this kingdom entire and pure than the most rigorous laws for

the punishment of such as diminish or counterfeit the same:And whereas, by the knowmlaws of this kingdom, no person ought to pav, or know? ingly tender in payment, any counterfeit or unlawful diminished money, and all persons not only may refuse to receive the same, but may, and by the ancient statutes and ordinances of this kingdom, have been required to destroy and deface the same; and more especially the tellers in the receipt of the exchequer, by their duty and oath of office, are required

to receive no money but good and true; and to the end the same might the better be discerned and known, by the ancient course of the said receipt of the exchequer, all money ought to be received there by weight as well as by tale: For the restoring of which course, together with other things, an Act was made in the last session of this present Parliament, in-; (tituled, An Act for the better observation of the course anciently used in the receipt of the Exchequer, whereby, amongst other things, it is enacted, That the respective tellers of the said receipt of the exchequer, when any money shall be brought to the said receipt of the exchequer, to be there paid, shall without delay receive it, weighing the same in entire sums or otherwise, and making due entry of the weight and tale thereof, according to the ancient course; but no provision is made in the said Act, that the said tellers shall refuse to receive the said money, in case it shall not

be of its due weight; and the former and ancient laws being grown into desuetude, whereby unlawfully diminished and counterfeit money receive a currency, and wicked and traitorous persons are encouraged to diminish and counterfeit the same:Now, to the end the kingdom, after so vast a charge and expence for the reformation of the silver coin, and restoring it

to its due weight and purity, may not relapse into the same evil from

II. And whereas the uttering of false money, knowing it to be false, is a

Class III.) Offences relating to Coin and Bullion.

c crime frequently committed all over-the kingdom, and the offenders therein are not deterred, by reason that it is only a misdemeanor, and the punishment very often but small, though there be great reason to believe, that

the common utterers of such false money are either themselves the coiners, or in confederacy with the coiners thereof: For preventing whereof. Be it hereby further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person whatsoever shall, after the said twenty-ninth day of September, utter or tender in payment any false or counterfeit money, (l) knowing the same to be false or counterfeit, to any person or persons, and shall be thereof convicted, such person so offending shall suffer six months* imprisonment, and find Sureties for his or her good behaviour for six months more, to be computed from the end of the said first six months; and if the same person shall afterwards be convicted a second time of the like offence of uttering or tendering in payment any false or counterfeit money, knowing the same to be so, such person shall for such second offence, suffer two years’ imprisonment, and find sureties for his or her good behaviour for two years more, to be computed from the end of the said first two years; and if the same person shall afterwards offend a third time in uttering or tendering in payment any false or counterfeit money, knowing the same to be so, and shall be convicted of such third offence, he or she shall be and is hereby adjudged to be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.

III. And it is hereby further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person whatsoever shall after the said twenty-ninth day of September, utter or tender in payment any false or counterfeit money, knowing the same to be false or counterfeit, to any person or persons, and shall either the same day, (2) or within the space of ten days then next, utter or tender in payment any more or other false or counterfeit money, knowing the same to be false or counterfeit, to the same person or persons, or to any other person or persons, or shall at the time of such uttering or tendering have about him or her, in his or her custody, one or more piece or pieces of counterfeit inoney, besides what was so uttered or tendered, then such person so uttering or tendering the same shall be deemed and taken to be a common ut-terer of false money, and being thereof convicted shall suffer a vear^s imprisonment, and shall find sureties for his or her good behaviour for two years more, to be computed from the end of the said year; and if any person having been once so convicted as a common utterer of false money, shall afterwards again utter or tender in payment any false or counterfeit money to any person or persons, knowing the same to be false or counterfeit, then such person being thereof convicted, shall for such second offence be and is hereby adjudged to be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy (3).

IV. And it is hereby further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the person or persons convicted of any of the treasons and felonies respectively hereinbefore mentioned, shall suffer death as in case of high treason and fe177

Uttering false money knowingly, six months’ imprisonment, and security for two years more.

For second offence, two years’ imprisonment, and security for two years.

For third offence, felony without clergy-,

Uttering false money twice within ten days,

or having other false money in custody, to suffer a year’s imprisonment, &c.

Subsequent offence, felony without clergyBlood not corrupted.

(1) This only applies to gold and silver; and an indictment for uttering counterfeit copper money cannot be sustained at common law; Criwan’s case, 1 East, P. C. c. 4, § 28. There have been several attempts to prosecute for the mere possession of base coin, but it has been lately decided that such an indictment could not be sustained. In a case before the late Ch. Baron Thomson, Lancaster Spring Assizes, 1816, the indictment was for procuring counterfeit money with intent to utter, which was contended to be an act, and therefore indictable. The only evidence being of possession of counterfeit money, under such circumstances as shewed an intent to utter, the learned judge was of opinion that the case was not

E roved:—-he also held that the procuring must e proved to be within the county. It seems desirable that there should be a legislative provision upon the subject: and Q. Whether

VoL. V.]

it would not be an improvement to allow a greater latitude of discretion in the punishment for uttering ?

(2) Where two litterings were charged in the same day, in two counts, and without a distinct averment that the second uttering was on the same day as the first, it was thought adviseable only to give judgment for six months’ imprisonment singly, and not on each of the counts; Eliz. Tandy’s case, lEast, ch.4. §. 29.

(3) It is not necessary to state in the indictment for the greater offence, that the defendant was a common utterer; nor that he should have been adjudged such in order to support an indictment for felony upon a subsequent uttering; Smith’s case, 1 E. P. C. ch.4, § 29. 2 B. and P. 127. R. v. Michael, 2 Leach, (4th edit.) 238. 1 East, Add. xix.

V. And it is hereby further enacted, That the person and persons that shall be guilty of any of the treasons, felonies, or crimes aforesaid, shall be indicted, arraigned, tried, and convicted by such like evidence, and in such manner as is now used and allowed against any offenders for counterfeiting the lawful coin; provided that there shall be no prosecution for any of the offences made treason or felony by this Act, unless such prosecution be commenced within six months next after such offence shall be committed.

VI. And whereas the coining or counterfeiting any of the copper money € of this kingdom is only a misdemeanor, and the punishment often very small; Be it hereby further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person whatsoever, shall after the said twenty-ninth day ofSeptember, make, coin, or counterfeit any brass or copper money, commonly called a halfpenny, or a farthing, such person offending therein, and his, her, and their aiders, abettors, and procurers being thereof convicted, shall suffer twa years’ imprisonment, and find sureties for his or her good behaviour for two years more, to be computed from the end of the said first two years (1).

VII. And it is hereby further enacted, That whoever shall after the said twenty-ninth day of September apprehend any person or persons who have committed any of the offences hereby made hign treason or felony, or who shall have made or counterfeited any of the copper money aforesaid, and shall prosecute such offenders, until he, she, or they shall be thereof convicted, such prosecutor and prosecutors shall have and receive from the sheriff or sheriffs of the county or city, where such conviction shall be made, for every such offender so convicted of any of the treasons or felonies aforesaid, the sum of forty pounds: and for every person *so convicted of coun-feiting any of the said copper money, the sum of ten pounds, without paying any fee for the same, within one month after such conviction, and demand thereof made, by tendering a certificate to the said sheriff or sheriffs for the time being, or ni3 or their under-sheriff, under the hands of the judge or justices before whom such conviction shall have been made, certifying such conviction, and that the offender or offenders were apprehended and prosecuted by the persons claiming the said reward, and thereby directing in what shares and proportions the said reward shall be paid and divided to and amongst such prosecutor or prosecutors; which certificate the said judge or justices are hereby required to give without delay or fee; and if the said sheriff or sheriffs shall not pay the said reward accordingly, within the time aforesaid, he or they shall forfeit to such prosecutor and prosecutors severally, double the sum which by the said certificate shall be directed to be severally paid to them, to be recovered by him, her, or them, or his, her, or their executors or administrators, in any of his Majesty’s Cdurts of Record at Westminster, by action of debt, bill, or information, with treble costs of suit, expended or paid in recovering the same; and such sheriff or sheriffs shall be allowed, or may deduct such rewards, upon his or their accounting with his Majesty, without any fee to be paid in respect thereof; and if he or they shall not on passing such account have money sufficient in his or their hands to answer what shall have been paid for such rewards, then the same shall be repaid by the lord treasurer, or commissioners of the Treasury for the time being, out of the revenues of the Crown, on certificate for that purpose from the clerk of the Pipe.

VIII. And be it hereby further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That whoever being out of prison, shall after the said twenty-ninth day of September, commit any of the offences aforesaid, and shall afterwards discover two or more persons, who shall after the time aforesaid have committed any of the said offences, so as such two or more persons shall be thereof convicted, such discoverer shall have, and is hereby intitled to his Majesty’s most gracious pardon for such his or her offences.

IX. And be it hereby further enacted, That if any person shall be convicted of uttering or tendering any false or counterfeit money as aforesaid, and shall

(1) Q. If not repealed by Stat. 11 G. III. c. 40, making the offence a felony.

Class IIL] Offences relating to Coin and Bullion.

afterwards be guilty of the like offence in any other county or city, the clerk of the Assize, or the clerk of the Peace for the county or city where such conviction was so had, shall at the request of the prosecutor, or any other on his Majesty’s behalf, certify the same by a transcript in a few words, containing the effect and tenor of such conviction; for which certificate two shillings and sixpence, and no more, shall be paid; and such certificate being produced in Court, shall be sufficient proof of such former conviction.

X. And whereas by an Act made in the seventh year of the reign of her late Majesty Queen Anne, intituled An Act for the continuing the former Act, for the Encouragement of Coinage, and to encourage the bringing Fo~ 4 reign Coins, and British or Foreign Plate to be coined, and for making Provision for the Mints in Scotland, and for the prosecuting Offences'concerning the Coin in England, there is a limited sum of four hundred pounds a-4 year, directed to be allowed out of the coinage duty for the expences of prosecuting offenders against the laws relating to the coin; which sum for several years last past has proved greatly deficient, insomuch that there appeal's to have been expended for the Carrying on of those prosecutions, the sum of seven hundred and two pounds three shillings and sevenpence, over and above the sum of four hundred pounds per annum allowed for that service; and as the law now stands, the said sum of seven hundred and two pounds three shillings and seven pence, cannot be brought to account; * Be it therefore further enacted. That the lord high treasurer, or the lords commissioners of the treasury for the time being, shall and may, out of the money arising by the coinage duty, order and allow such further sums of money as the expences of the said prosecutions have in such last years amounted to, over and above the said four hundred pounds a year: and also shall and may, at all times hereafter, order and allow out of the money arising by the said coinage duty such sums of money, for defraying the future expences of the said prosecutions, as he or they shall see fit, provided the said expences do not, in any one year, exceed the sum of six hundred pounds (1).

coin, and the bringing into this realm, and uttering within the same, false

and counterfeit foreign gold and silver coin, and particularly pieces of gold

coin commonly called Louis d*Or, and pieces of silver com commonly called Dollars, hath of late greatly increased; and it is expedient that

[No. II.] 4 Edward I. st. 2. — Of what things a Coroner shall inquire.

A CORONER of our Lord the King ought to inquire of these things,

first, when coroners are commanded by the King’s bailiffs, or by honest men of the country, they shall go to the places where any be slain,

or suddenly dead or wounded, or where houses are broken, or where treasure is said to be found, and shall forthwith command four of the next

towns, or five or six, to appear before him in such a place; and whefi they are come thither, the coroner, upon the oath of them, shall inquire

in this manner, that is to wit. If it concerns a man slain, whether they

know where the person was slain, whether it were in any house, field, bed,

tavern, or company, and if any* and who were there; Likewise, it is to be

inquired, who were, and in what manner culpable, either of the act, or of

the force, and who were present, either men or women, and of what age

soever they be (if they can speak, or have any discretion); and how many

soever be found culpable by inquisition in any of the manners aforesaid,

they shall be taken and delivered to the sheriff, and shall be committed

to the gaol; and such as be founden, and be not culpable, shall be attached until the coming of the justices, and their names shall be written 4 in the rolls of the coroners. If it fortune any such man be slam in the

fields or woods, and be there found, first it is to be inquired, whether he

were slain there or not; and if he were brought and laid there, they shall

do so much as they can to follow their steps that brought the body thither, 4 or of the horse* which brought him, or cart, i£ perchance, he was brought

TBe murtherer upon a horse or cart: It shall be inquired also if the dead person were

found culpa- f known, or else a stranger, and where he lay the night before; and if there

ble. r be any who are said to be guilty of the murder, the ooroner shall imme4 diately go unto their house, and shall inquire what goods they have, and what corn they have in their grange, and if they be freemen, they shall

inquire how much land they have, and what it is worth yearly; and further, what corn they have upon the ground. And when they have thus inquired upon every thing, they shall cause all the corn and goods to be valued, and the land to be extended, so that they may be sold inconti- nently, and thereupon they shall be delivered to the whole township, 4 which shall be answerable before the justices for all; and likewise of his freehold, how much it is worth yearly, over and above the service due to the lords of the fee; and the land shall remain in the King’s hands, until the lords of the fee Jiave made fine for it. And immediately upon these things being inquired, the bodies of such persons being dead or slain shall be buried.

Person drown- II. 4 In like manner, it is to be inquired of them that be drowned, of ed, or suddenly suddenly dead, and after it is to be seen of such bodies, whether they A~nA 4 were so drowned, .or slain, or strangled, by the sign of a cord tied streight

about their necks, or about any of their members, or upon any other hurt

found upon their bodies, whereupon they shall proceed in the form above- said; and if they were not slam, then ought the coroner to attach the finders, and all other in the company. A coroner also ought to inquire of treasure that is found, who know the finders, and likewise who is suS-4 pected thereof; and that may be well perceived where one liveth riotous-4 fy, haunting taverns, and hath done so of long time; hereupon he may be attached for this suspicion by four, or six, or more pledges, if they may be found. Further, if any be appealed of rape, he must be attached, if the appeal be fresh, and they must see apparent sign of truth, by effusion of blood, or an open cry made; and such shall be attached by four or six pledges, if he may be found/; . If the appealwere without cry, or without any manifest effusion of blood, two pleages shall be sufficient. Upon appeal of wounds and such like, especially if the wounds be mortal, the parties appealed shall be taken immediately, and kept until it be known perfectly, whether he that is hurt shall recover or not; and if he die, the offenders shall be kept; and if the parties hurt recover health, the offenders shall be attached by four or six pledges, after, as the wound is great or small. If it bo for a maim, he shall find more than four pledges; if it

‘/CONCERNING the authority of stewards and marshals, and of such 4 pleas as they mav hold, and in what manner, it is ordained. That from

henceforth they shall not hold plea of freehold, neither of debt, nor of

covenant, nor of any contract made between the King’s people, but only

of trespass done within the house, and of other trespasses done within

the verge, and of contracts and covenants that one of the King’s house c shall have made with another of the same house, and in the same house,

and none other where. And they shall plead no plea of trespass other than that which shall be attached by them before the King depart from

the verge where the trespass shall be committed; and shall plead them (speedily from day to day, so that they may be pleaded and determined

before that the King depart out of the limits of the same verge where the trespass was done. And if it so be that they cannot be determined within the limits of the same verge, then shall the same pleas cease before the steward, and the plaintiffs shall have recourse to the common law. And from henceforth the steward shall not take cognizance of debts nor of other things, but of people of the same house, nor shall hold none other plea by obligation made at the distress of the steward and of the marshals. And if the steward or marshals do any thing contrary to this ordinance, it shall be holden as void. And forasmuch as heretofore many felonies committed within the verge have been unpunished, 4 because the coroners of the country have not been authorized to inquire of such manner of felonies done within the verge, but the coroner of the King’s house, which never continueth in one place, by reason whereof there can be no trial made in due manner, nor the felons put in exigent, nor outlawed, nor any thing presented in the circuit, the which hath been to the great damage of the King, and nothing to the good preservation of his peace; it is ordained, That from henceforth in cases of the death of men, whereof the coroner’s office is to make view and inquest, it shall be commanded to the coroner of the county, that he with the coroner of the King’s house, shall do as be- longeth to his office, and inroll it. And that thing that cannot be determined before the steward where the felons cannot be attached, or for other like cause, shall be remitted to the common law, so that-exigents, 4 outlawries, and presentments shall be made thereupon, in eyre by the coroner of the country, as well as of other felonies done out of the verge; nevertheless they shall not omit, by reason hereof, to make attachments freshly upon the felonies done.

FORASMUCH as the most necessary office and duty of the Law is to

preserve and save the life of man, and condignly to punish such persons that unlawfully and'wilfully murder, slay or destroy men, and also that another office and duty of law is to punish robbers and thieves,

which daily endeavour themselves to rob and steal, or give assistance to

the same, and yet by craft and cautele do escape from the same without

punishment: II. And where it often happeneth and cometh in ure in sundry countips of this realm, that a man is feloniously stricken in one county, and after f dieth in another county, in which case it hath not been founden by the

laws or customs of this realm, that any sufficient indictment thereof can

be taken in any of the said two counties, for that by the custom of this realm the jurors of the county where such party died of such stroke, can take no knowledge of the said stroke being in a foreign county, although

the same two counties and places adjoin very near together; ne the

juries of the county where the stroke was given cannot take knowledge ‘of the death in another county, although such death most apparently came of the same 6troke: So that the King’s Majesty within his own realm cannot, by any laws yet made or known, punish such murderers or manquellers, for offences in this form committed and done; nor any appeal at some'time may lie for the same, but doth also fail, and the said murderers and manquellers escape thereof without punishment, as well in < pases where the counties where such pffences be committed and done may join, 'as otherwise where they may not join. And also it is a common practice amongst errant thieves and robbers in this realm, that after they have robbed or stolen in one county, they will convey their spoil, or part thereof so robbed and stolen, unto some of their adherents into some other county where the principal offence was not committed ne done, who f knowing of such felony, willingly and by false covin receiveth the same: In which case, although the principal felon be after attainted in one

county, the accessary escapeth by reason that he was accessary in another county, and that the jurors of the said other county, by any law yet

made, can take no knowledge of the principal felony ne attainder in the

first county, and so such accessaries escape thereof unpunished, and do

passion of juries, who were apt to consider that to be a provocation for extenuating murder, which was not so in law. — It was agreed by the judges in Lord Morley’s case, that the statute was only declaratory of the common law; and Mr. Justice Foster, in commenting upon it, has in conformity with this opinion declared, that whenever the defendant is indicted at common law, and also upon the statute, the question most worthy of consideration is, whether the fact upon the evidence be murder at the common law, or not ? In all cases of doubt, therefore, the construction upon the statute ought to be in conformity with the benign principles of the common law; and all circumstances which, at common law, will serve to justify, excuse, or alleviate, on a charge of murder, have always had their due weight in prosecutions grounded on the statute; 1 East, P. C. c. 5. § 28.

(1) The statute is confined to the very person stabbing or thrusting, and does not extend to others aiding or abetting; 1 Hale, 468; Foster, 355. — The thrusting with a stick or other blunt weapon seems within the statute:so shooting with fire-arms, or sending an arrow out of a bow, or using any device of that kind, holden in the hand of the party at the instant of discharging it: but Qn. as to the case of a pistol, or a blow with a sword. Where the weapon is delivered out of the hand at the time the stroke is given, as by casting a hammer, or where a sword was thrown twenty yards, it has been thought that the case was not within the statute; see 1 East, P. C. c. 5. § 29, and the authorities there referred to.

III. Provided always.

Whether this relates to the whole time of the combat, or only to the instant when the stab is given?—Upon which the judges were divided in Hunter’s case, 3 Lev. 255, It appears upon the whole, that if the party killed be at any one instant of time during the controversy, out of the protection of the statute, the case will not be governed by the statute; ’ 2 East, P. C. c. 5. §29.

(2) If another person acting in concert with the party killed had a weapon drawn, it is sufficient to take the case out of the statute; as where a person stood with a sword undrawn to stop the prisoner from going out, while a bailiff was sent for to arrest him; Buckner’s case, Syles 463. A cudgel or other thing proper for annoyance, is sufficient to take a case out of the statute; East, ibid.; Foster, 300.

(3) In Byard’s case, W. Jones, 340, this was held to relate only to the casetof the person killed having stricken the first blow; but contrary to this opinion, if such person has stricken at all before the mortal blow given,

the case is not within the statute; 1 East, ibid, and authorities there cited.

(4} The indictment ought to follow the words of the statute, and alledge that the prisoner stabbed the deceased, he having then no weapon drawn, nor having first stricken; and, come semble, should alledge that the death took place within six months. It is usual to conclude contra formam statuti, but not necessary, as the statute only takes away the benefit of clergy from an act which is felony at common law. - If the indictment charges that A. stabbed and B. aided and abetted, and it is proved that B. stabbed and A. aided and abetted, there can be no judgment on the statute, but only judgment for manslaughter at common law. See 1 East, c. 5. § 118.

(5) For other cases of extenuation, which have been lield to take the offence out of the Act, see 1 East, c. 5. §29; concluding with the opinion of Glyn C. J. in Buckner’s case, Syles, 467. — That, in order to bring a case within the statute, there ought to be malice.

adequate means have been hitherto provided for the prevention and punishment of such offencesBe it therefore enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Tempohd, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That if any person or persons, from and after the first day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and three, shall, either in England or Ireland, wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully shoot at any of his Majesty’s subjects, or shall wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully present, point, or level any kind of loaded firearms at any of his Majesty’s subjects, and attempt, by drawing a trigger, or in any other manner, to discharge the same at or against nis or their person jot persons, (1) or shall wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully stab or cut (2) any of his Majesty’s subjects, with intent in so doing, or by means thereof, to murder, or rob, or to maim, disfigure, or disable such his Majesty's subject or subjects, or with intent (3) to do some other grievous bodily harm to such his Majesty’s subject or subjects, or with intent to obstruct, resist, or prevent the lawful apprehension and detainer of the person or persons so stabbing or cutting, or the lawful apprehension and detainer of any of his, her, or their accomplices for any offences for which he, she, or they mav respectively be liable by Law to be apprehended, imprisoned, or detained; or shall wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully administer to, or cause to be administered to or taken by any of his Majesty’s subjects, any deadlypoison, or other noxious and destructive substance or thing, with intent such lus Majesty’s subject or subjects thereby to murder, or thereby to cause and procure the miscarriage of any woman then being quick with child$ (4) or shall wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully set fire to any house, barn, granary, hop oast, malthouse, stable, coach house, outhouse, mill, warehouse, or shop, whether such house, barn, granary, hop oast, malthouse, stable, coach house, outhouse, mill, warehouse, or shop, shall then be in the possession of the person or persons so setting fire to the same, or in the possession of any other person or persons, or Of any body corporate, with intent thereby to injure or defraud (5) his Majesty, or any of his Majesty's

Persons in England or Ireland who shall maliciously shoot, or attempt to shoot at, or shall stab or cut, with intent to murder, rob, or maim, &c. any of his Majesty’s subjects; or to prevent arrests of culprits; or shall administer poison (see § 2); or shall maliciously set fire to any house, &c. shall be guilty of felony without clergy.

(1) Indictment on stat. 43 Geo. III. c. 58. The first count states that A, with a certain pistol, feloniously, wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully, did shoot at D. with intent feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, to kill and murder him; and that

B. and C. were aiding and abetting A. Another count states that an unknown person feloniously, wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully did shoot at D. with intent, feloniously, . •wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, to kill and murder him; and that A. B. and C. were aiding and abetting the said unknown person the felony aforesaid, in manner and form aforesaid, to do and commit; and were then and there knowing of and privy to the committing of the said felony; without alleging that they were feloniously present, aiding, &c. The jury acquitted B. and C. and^ found A. guilty generally; but afterwards added that he was not the person who fired the pistol: Held, that A. was well convicted on this indictment.

(2) In a case at Chester assizes, before Dallas, C. J. and Burton, J. it was ruled that a blow with the handle of a windlass, which made an incision was not a cutting within this Act.

(3) Upon a case at Chester, before Dallas,

C. J. and Burton, J. after respiting judgment and consulting other judges, it was held that an indictment for cutting with an intent to do some grievous bodily harm, without saying in so doing or by means thereof, ’ was not sufficient

(4) It is observable that the using an instrument, &c. with intent to cause abortion, which by section II. is a clergyable felony in case of the woman not being quick with child, is not noticed by this Act in the case of a woman being quick with child.

II. And whereas it may sometimes happen that poison or some other

other noxious and destructive substance or thing may be given, or other

means used, with intent to procure miscarriage or abortion where the woman may not be quick with child at the time, or it may not be ‘proved that she was quick with childBe it therefore further enacted, That if any person or persons, from and after the said first day of July, in the said year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and three, shaH wilfully and maliciously administer to, of cause to be administered to, or taken by any woiUan, any medicines, drug or other substance or thing whatsoever, or shall use or employ, or cause or procure to be used or employed, any instrument or means whatsoever, with intent thereby to cause or procure the miscarriage of any woman not being, or not being-proved to be quick with child at the time of administering such things or using such means, that then and in every such case the person or persons so offending, their counsellors, aiders, and abettors, knowing of and privy to such offence, shall be and are hereby declared to be guilty of felony, and shall be liable to be fined, imprisoned, set in and upon the pillory, publickly or privately whipped, or to suffer one or more of the said punishments, or to be transported beyond the seas for any term not exceeding fourteen years at the discretion of the Court before which such offender shall be tried and convicted.

(III. And whereas doubts have been entertained respecting the true sense and meaning of a certain Act of Parliament, made m England, in the twenty-first year of the reign of his late Majesty Ring James the first, inti- tilled, An Act to prevent the destroying and mut'thering of bastard Children;

and also of a certain other Act of Parliament, made in Ireland in the sixth year of the reign of her late Majesty Queen Anne, also intituled, 4 An Act to prevent the destroying and murthering of Bastard Children; add the same have been found in sundry cases, difficult and inconvenient to be put in practicefor remedy whereof, Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the first day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and three, the said two several Acts, and every thing therein contained, shall be, and the same are hereby repealed; and that, from and after the said first day of July, in the said year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and three, the trials in England and Ireland respectively, of women charged with the murder of any issue of their bodies, male or female, which being born alive would by Law be bastard, shall proceed and be governed by such and the like rules of evidence and of presumption as are by Law used and allowed to take place in respect to other trials for murder, and as if the said two several Acts had never been made.

IV. Provided always, and be it enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the jury by whose verdict any prisoner charged (1) with such murder

as aforesaid shall be acquitted, to find, in case it shall so appear in evidence that the prisoner was delivered of issue of her body, male or female, which if born alive would have been bastard, and that she did, by secret burying or otherwise, endeavour to conceal the birth thereof, and thereupon it shall be lawful for the court before which such prisoner shall have been tried, to adjudge that such prisoner shall be committed to the common gaol or house of correction for any term not exceeding two years.

[No. VI.] 32 Henry VIII. c. 10. — A Repeal of the Punishment by Death of Priests married or unmarried, and of Women offending with them by Incontinency, limited by the Statute of 31 H. 8. c. 14. A Priest offending by Incontinency, and convict according to the Laws mentioned in 31 H. 8. c. 14. shall the first Time forfeit to the King all his Goods, Chattels, Debts, and all his Spiritual Promotions, saving one; and being the second Time convict, he shall forfeit all his Goods, Chattels, Debts, and the Issue and Profits of all his Lands, Benefices and Prorno(1) If the force be. in one county and the woman afterwards go into another, and be there married or defiled, the case is not within the Act. The case of R. v. Gordon, for an offence against this Act, Oxford Spring Assizes, 1804, which excited great public attention, was stopped on this ground: Mrs. Lee, the prosecutrix, having admitted upon cross-examination, that before she got into the county of Oxford she had thrown away a camphire-bag, which she regarded as a charm, and exclaimed Now welcome pleasure; but if the force at all continued in the same county, the consent to marriage or defilement does not excuse. The indictment must follow the statute in alledging that the woman had in substance, in lands or goods; or was an heiress, that she was taken against her will, for lucre, and married or defiled; but need not alledge that the taking was with intent to marry or defile her. It is not material that the party marrying was not the author of the original force, or that the woman at first consented, if she afterwards refused. The marriage, though voidable on account of the force, is a sufficient marriage, de facto, to bring the case within the statute. The womau, notwithstanding such marriage, is a competent witness to prove the fact. Sir M. Hale observes, that in Burn’s case, 25 Car. II. most were of opinion, that if the female had lived with the prisoner any considerable time, and consented to the marriage, she could not have been admitted as a witness. This is justly questioned by Sir Wm. Blackstone, 4 Com. 209, and Sir E. East, 1 P. C. 454, upon the ground, that if she were a competent witness at the time of the marriage, no subsequent assent can incapacitate her. See the several points above stated, with the authorities, 1 East, P. C. Ch.xi. s. 1.

(2) The barely receiving the offender is not a case within the statute; and the party receiving is only an accessary at common law; 1 Hale, 661. 1 Hawk. ch. xlii. s. 7, 8. I East, ch, xi. s. 1.

kinsfolks, to the high displeasure of Almighty God, disparagement of the said children, and the extreem continual heaviness of all their friends:

which ungodly dealing, for lack of wholesome laws to the redress thereof,

remaineth a great, familiar and common mischief in this our commonwealth: ’

II. For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the King and Queen’s Majesties, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, of this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That it snail not be lawful to any person or persons to take or convey away, or cause to be taken or conveyed away, any maid or woman child unmarried, being under the age of sixteen years, out of or from the possession, custody or governance, and against the will (l) of the father (2) of such maid or woman child, or of such person or persons to whom the father of such maid or woman child, by his last will and testament, or by any other act in his life-time, hath or shall appoint, assign, bequeath, give or grant the order, keeping, education or governance of such maid or woman child, except such taking and conveying away as shall be had, made or done, by or for such person or persons, as without fraud of covin be or then shall be the master or mistress of such maid or woman child, or the guardian in sbcage, or guardian ip chivalry, of or to such maid or woman child.

III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons above the age of xiv. years shall from and after the first day of April next coming, unlawfully take or convey, or cause to be taken or conveyed, any maid or woman child unmarried, being within the age of xvi. years, out of or from the possession and against the will, of the father or mother (3) of such child, or out of or from the possession and against the will of such person or persons as then shall happen to have, by any lawful ways or means, the order, keeping, education or governance (4) of any such maiden or woman child; that then every such person and persons so offending, being thereof lawfully attainted or convicted by the order and due course of the laws of this realm (other than such of whom such person taken away shall hold any lands or tenements by knight’s service) shall have and suffer imprisonment of his or their bodies, by the space of two whole years, without bail or mainprise, or else shall pay such fine for his or their said offence, as shall be assessed by the council of the Queen’s highness, her heirs or successors, in the Star-Chamber (5) at Westminster.

IV. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons, after the said day, shall so take away, or cause to be taken away as is aforesaid, and deflower any such maid or woman child as is aforesaid, or shall against the will, or unknowing of or to the father of any such maid or woman child, if the father be in life, or against the will or unknowing of the mother of any such maid or woman child (having the custody or governance of sufrh child, if the father be dead) by secret letters, messuages, or otherwise contract matrimony with any such maiden or woman child, except such contracts of matrimony as shall be made by the consent of such person or persons, as by the title of wardship shall then have or be intituled to have the marriage of such maid or woman child;

(1) If the father once agreed, though he afterwards dissented, it is said to be an assent within this Act; Culthorp v. Axtel, 3 Mod. 84; but this was not the point in judgment,

(2) The putative father of a baslard is within the Act; R. v. Bamforth, 2 Str. 1162; R. v. Sweeting, 1 Ea t, ch. xi. § 6.

(3 The mother retains her authority notwithstanding her marriage to a second husband; and the assent of such husband is not material; Rateliffe’s case., 3 Co. 39. b.

(4) The mother placed her daughter with Lady Gore for safe custody, who caused her own son to marry the girl without her mother’s consent. Lord C. J. Herbert observed, that

the Statute was made to prevent children from being seduced from their parents or guardians by flattering or enticing words, promises, or gifts, and married in a secret way to their disparagement; but that no such thing appeared in this case; the marriage being openly solemnized in church, in a canonical hour, in the presence of many persons; and the plaintiff, who sued on the forfeitures of the Act, was nonsuited; Hicks c. Gore, 3 Mod. 84. See observations on this case, l East, P. C. ch. xi. $ 7.

(5) The King’s Bench has jurisdiction of this offence; the Statute not containing any negative words; Moot’s case, 2 Mod. 128,

that then every such person or persons so offending, being thereof lawfully convicted, as is aforesaid, shall suffer imprisonment of his or their bodies, by the space of five years, without bail or mainprise, or else shall pay such fine for nis or their said offence, as shall be assessed by the said council in the said Star-Chamber; the one moiety of all which forfeitures and fines shall be to the King and Queen's majesties, her heirs and successors, the other moiety to the parties grieved.

V. And be it further enacted by the said authority, That the King and Queen's highness’ honourable council of the Star-Chamber, by bill of complaint or information, and justices of assize by inquisition or indictment, shall have authority by virtue of this Act to hear and determine the said offences; upon every which indictment and inquisitions, such process shall be awarded and lie, as upon an indictment of trespass at the common law.

VI. And further be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any woman child or maiden, being above the age of twelve years, and under the age of sixteen years, do at any time consent or agree to such person that so shall make any contract of matrimony, contrary to the form and effect of this Statute, that then the next of the kin of the same woman child or maid, to whom the inheritance should descend, return or come, after the decease of the same woman child and maid, shall from the time of such assent and agreement have, hold and enjoy all such lands, tenements and hereditaments, as the same woman child and maiden had in possession, reversion or remainder, at the time of such consent and agreement, during the life of such person that shall so contract matrimony: And after the decease of such person so contracting matrimony, that then the said lands, tenements and hereditaments, shall descend, revert, remain, and come to such person or persons as they should have done in case this Act had never been had, * ne made, other than to him only that so shall contract matrimony.

VII. Provided always, and be it enacted, That this Act, nor any thing therein contained, shall extend to take away or diminish any liberty, custom or authority, touching or concerning any orphan or orphans, which now be or hereafter shall be within the city of London, or any other city, borough or town, where orphans are commonly used to be provided for, either by grant or by custom, but that the Lord Mayor of the said city of London, and the Aldermen of the same for the time being, and all and every other head officer or officers of any other city borough or town, where such orphans be provided for, shall and may have and take like rule, order, keeping and charge of such orphan and orphans, and of all their lands, tenements, goods and chattels, as heretofore they or any of them lawfully had or used, or lawfully might have had and used, if this Act had not been made.

Sons from Marriage until their former Wives and former Husbands be dead.

FORASMUCH as divers evil disposed persons being married, out of one county into another, or into places where they are not known,

and there become to be married, having another husband or wife living, to the great dishonour of God, and utter undoing of divers honest men’s children, and others; * Be it therefore enacted by the King’s Majesty, with the consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and of the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, That if any person or persons within his Majesty’s dominions of England and Wales, being married, or which hereafter shall marry, do at any time after the end of the Session of this present Parliament, marry any person or persons, the former husband or wife being alive; that then every such offence shall be felony, and the person and persons so offending shall suffer death as in cases of felony; and the party and parties so offending shall receive such and the like proceeding, trial and execution in such county where such person or persons shall be apprehended, (1) as if the offence had been committed in such county where such person or persons shall be taken or apprehended.

II. Provided always, That this Act, nor any thing therein contained, shall extend to any person or persons whose husband or wife shall be continually remaining beyond the seas by the space of seven years together, (2) or whose husband ur wife shall absent him or herself the one from the other by the space of seven years together, in any parts within his Majesty’s dominions, (3) the one of them not knowing the other to be living within that time.

III. Provided also, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That this Act, nor any thing herein contained, shall extend to any person or persons that are or shall be at the time of such marriage divorced by any sentence had or hereafter to be had in the Ecclesiastical Court; (4) or to any person or persons where the former marriage hath been or hereafter shall be by sentence in the Ecclesiastical Court declared to be void (5) and of no effect; nor to any person or persons for or by reason of any former marriage had or made, or hereafter to be had or made within age of consent.

It is supposed in E. P. ch. 12. § 1, that by the statute de Bigamis, 4 Ed. I. c. 5, the offence mentioned in this statute was constituted a capital felony; and it is observed that the benefit of clergy was restored by stat. 1 Ed. I. c. 12. § 16, (anteCl. II. No. 18.) But this view of the statutes alluded to is founded on a mistake; as the enactment in the first statute did not relate to marriage during the life of a former husband or wife as being a substantive felony; but to the excluding from the privilege of clergy persons convicted of any other felony, who had been twice married, or who had married a widow or widower, which by the latter statute was abrogated. This appears very distinctly upon the face of the statutes themselves.

(1) Kelyng and Hawkins make a quaere, Whether a person committing polygamy in Ireland is not by this provision within the Act. But there is strong objection to presume, without express words, that the Act intended to legislate for offences out of the kingdom; and the provision is fully satisfied by applying to the trial in one county of an offence committed in another. See 1 East, ch. 12. §2.

(2) This exception is held to apply although the party have notice; 1 Hale, 693; 3 Inst. 88. The exception extends to Ireland; 1 Hale, 693.

(3) This in Favorem Vita must be intended England, Wales, and Scotland, 1 Hale, 693.

(4) A divorce a Mensd et Thoro is sufficient; 1 Hawk. ch. 43. sec. 5.; Middleton’s Case, Kelyng 27; 1 E. P. C. ch. 12. § 4. In the case of William Martin Lolly, Lane. Sept. Ass. 1812, it appeared that the prisoner and his wife had been divorced by the Courts of Scotland, at the suit of the wife, for the adultery of the husband, which divorce, by the law of Scotland, is a dissolution of the marriage; and the case being reserved for the opinion of the Judges, Thomson B. at the assizes following stated it to be their opinion ~1. That a marriage lawfully contracted in England, cannot be dissolved in a different country by any authority whatever; and 2. That the proviso relates only to the sentences of Courts in England. The question as to the effect of such divorce afterwards occurred, Tovey v. Lindsay, in Dem. Proe. 1 Dow. 117, which was remitted to the Court below for review. Q.

John Coventry received divers wounds, some of which were given him in No. XXIV. < such barbarous manner, that some of the offenders held him whilst others

wounded him. (I) 22 & 23C.IL

II. And whereas by several bills of indictment found by the grand jury C. 1 for the city and liberty of Westminster, where the said facts were committed. Sir Thomas Sandys knight, Charles Obrian esquire, Simon Parry,

and Miles Reeves, amongst others, stand indicted of felony and robbery for the same, but have fled from justice, not daring to abide a legal trial

Be it therefore enacted, &c. “ Sir Thomas Sandys, &c.

VII. And for prevention of the like mischiefs for the time to come, be it Malicious further enacted by tl*e authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons, maiming made from and after the four and twentieth day of June, which shall be in the year felony, of our Lord God one thousand six hundred seventy and one, on purpose and of malice forethought, (2) and by lying in wait, (3) shall unlawfully cut out or disable the tongue, put out an eye, slit (4) the nose, cut off a nose or

(1) The history of this transaction, as related by Burnet, Histy. vol. I. 269, fo. and adopted almost verbatim by Hume, is, that Sir John Coventry, in a debate in the House of Commons upon a proposal for taxing play-houses, had reflected upon the amours of the King. “ This was carried with great indignation to the court. It was said that this was the first time that the King was personally reflected upon. If it was passed over, inorfe of the same kind would follow, and it would grow a practice to talk so. It was therefore thought fit to take such severe notice of this, that nobody should dare totalkat that rate for the future. The Duke of York told me he said all he could to the King to divert him from the resolution he took; which was, to send some of the guards and watch in the streets where Sir John lodged, and leave a mark upon him.” After stating the particulars of the violence he adds, “ Coventry had his nose so well needled up, that the scar was scarce to be discerned. This (i. e. the attack, come semble) put the House of Commons in a furious uproar. They passed a Bill of banishment against the actors of it, and put a clause in it, that it should not be in the King’s power to pardon them.”

(2) It is not necessary that there should be a previous malice against the individual wounded—an attack upon a stranger is sufficient. See Carrol’s case, 1 East, ch. 7. §3, 4.

(3) In Mills’s case, 1783, 1 East, ch. 7. § 5. Leach, Case 130, the Court said, “ A person who intends to do this kind of mischief to another, and by deliberately watching an opportunity, carries that intention into execution, may be said to lie in wait on purpose. It is not necessary that he should plant himself in any particular concealment, and effect the mischief by rushing fromhis lurking place. If, having formed an intention to maim, he takes a convenient opportunity of deliberately doing the injury, it is a lying in wait, although he do not take any particular time, or appear to use any extraordinary degree of preparation to perpetrate the mischief.” In that case the prosecutor was passingwith his master’s cart, and was beset by a gang of thieves, several of whom cried out, “ Damn you, where are your knives, ” upon which the prisoner gave the wound in question. No other motive could be assigned for the outrage, but that the prosecutor had before detected and beat off some thieves who had endeavoured to rob his cart at the same place. Eyre B. left it to the jury, with the preceding observations, Whether the fact was deliberately and intentionally done, by lying in wait for that purpose on the account suggested, or from any other malicious and deliberate motive; or whether it were a sudden impulse of rage, not in the previous contemplation of the parties? Tl\e prisoner was convicted. In Carrol’s case* ub. sup. the prisoners followed two boys who were to rob, declaring they would stab or cut the nose off the first man who molested them. Mr. Kerby having detected one of the boys, Carrol, who was lurking about, came up to them, and after walking backwards and forwards, gives the wound, saying, u Damn you, let the Boy go; ” and all the judges were of opinion that there was a sufficient lying in wait. But where the prisoner was detected stealing turnips, and immediately struck the prosecutor with an iron instrument, the.case was held not to be within the statute; R. v. Tickner, Leach, Case 94; IE. P. C. ch 7. § 6. So where the prisoner, who was at the head of a press-gang, pressed the prosecutor by whom he had been arrested some time before, saying, u I will be revenged, ” and the prosecutor resisted, and was wounded by the prisoner, who had previously said, “ To if, Boys, ” to his men; R. t?.

Gould and Yates J. were of opinion (dubitant Willes J. and Eyre B.) that the slitting of the nose was not confined to any particular form or direction; but that any division of the flesh or gristle of the nose, whether perpendicular or transverse, came within the clear denomination of a slit.

(5) In the well known case of Coke and Woodburne, at Suffolk Assizes, 8 Geo. I. the prisoners alleged, by way of defence, that their intention was not to maim but to murder; but Lord King held it to be a question for the jury, Whether the means to accomplish the purpose, and the consequences of those means, were not likewise in their intention and design; and whether every blow and cut were not intended, as well as the object for which the prisoners insisted they were given ? In the conference of the judges on Carrol’s case, Willes J. and Eyre B. expressed some dissatisfaction with this case, and thought at least that the construction ought not to be carried further; 1 East, ch. 7. 6.

FORASMUCH as the counsellors and contrivers of theft and other felonies, and the receivers of goods that have been stolen, are the

principal cause of the commission of such felonies; and as the Law now

is no accessory can be convicted or suffer any punishment where the principal is not attainted, or hath the benefit of his clergy; * Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the twelfth day of February, which snail be in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and two, if any principal offender shall be convicted of any felony, or shall stand mute, or peremptorily challenge above the number of twenty persons returned to serve of the Jury, it shall and may be lawful to proceed against any accessoiw, either before or after the fact, in the same manner as if such principal felon had been attainted thereof, notwithstanding any such principal felon shall be admitted to the benefit of his clergy, pardoned, or otherwise delivered before attainder; and every such accessory shall suffer the same punishment, if he or she be convicted, or shall stand mute, or peremptorily challenge above the number of twenty persons returned to serve of the jury, as he or she should have suffered if the principal had been attainted.

II. And forasmuch as buyers and receivers of stolen goods do oftentimes convey away and conceal the principal felons, so that they cannot be convicted of such principal felony, and thereby such buyers and receivers have escaped all manner of punishment, which hath greatly encouraged the buying and receiving of such stolen goodsFor remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twelfth day of February, one thousand seven hundred and two, it shall and may be lawful to prosecute and punish every such person and persons buying or receiving any stolen goods, knowing the same to be stolen, as for a misdemeanor, to be punished by fine and imprisonment, although the principal felon be not before convicted of the said felony, which shall exempt the offender from being punished as accessory, if the principal shall be afterwards convicted.

III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twelfth day of February, one thousand seven hundred and two, all and every person and persons, who shall be produced to appear as a witness or witnesses on the behalf of the prisoner, upon any trial for treason or felony, before he or she be admitted to depose, or give any manner of evidence, shall first take an oath to depose the truth, tnc whole truth, and nothing but the truth, in such manner, as the witnesses for the Queen are by law obliged to do; and if convicted <tf any, wilful perjury in such evidence, shall suffer all the punishments, penalties, forfeitures and disabilities, which by any of the laws and statutes of this realm are and may be inflicted upon persons convicted of wilful perjury.

IV. And for the effectual preventing the wilful casting away, burning, or otherwise destroying, by masters and mariners, of ships under their charge; Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any captain, master, mariner* or other officer belonging to any ship, shall, after the said twelfth day of February, one thousand seven hundred and two, wilfully cast away, burn, or otherwise destroy the ship, unto which he belongeth, or procure the same to be done, to the prejudice of the owner or owners thereof, or of any merchant or merchants that shall load goods thereon, he shall suffer death as a felon, (l)

In the course of bis opinion, Lord Mansfield

made the following observations: tenderness ought always to prevail in criminal cases, so far at least as to take care that a man may not suffer otherwise than by due course of law, nor have any hardship done him, or severity exercised upon him, where the construction may admit a reasonable doubt or difficulty. But tenderness does not require such a construction of words (perhaps not absolutely and perfectly clear and express) as would tend to render the law nugatory and ineffectual, and destroy or evade the very end and intention of it; nor does it require of us that we should go into such nice and strained critical objections as are contrary to the true meaning and spirit of it/ It had been urged that, according to the expressions.' of the verdict, 1 that the defendant abetted by shouting, and incited others so to do, the jury had only found that the prisoner had incited to shout, and not to demolish.

(1) The action is not maintainable unless the rioters are guilty of a felony within the fourth section; and upon this ground, where rioters, at a general illumination, broke the windows, uprights of the sashes, and window frames, on account of the house not being illuminated, it was ruled that the plaintiff could not recover: Reid v. Clarke, 7 T. R. 496, supra, in which the points arise in actions against the hundred. For breaking open a detached building, and throwing flour into the street, the plaintiff' is not entitled to recover; Wilmot v. Horton, Doug. 701. The plaintiff is entitled to recover for furniture, &c. destroyed, or for damage done to a garden, forming part of the same transaction with the demolishing of the house, though not inconsequence of it; Radcliffet?.Eden, Cowp. 485; Hyde ».

then declared that unless he were released they would pull the house down, and they did enter and break the windows, window-frames, &c. and for that purpose used some of the arms found in the shop, and carried away others; Held; that this was evidence of a purpose to demolish the house and that the owner might recover against the hundred a reparation in damages for the injury done to the house itself; and to the arms actually used in the act of demolishing; but that he was not entitled to recover for the value of the aims carried away, that being a substantive and distinct felony, and therefore not within the stat. 1 Geo.

Williams, 1790. the prisoner, (who from having made various assaults on females in the streets of London, with a sharp instrument, had excited considerable terror, and was the subject of general conversation by the name of the monster) being indicted on this Act, and it appearing that he had cut and severely wounded the prosecutrix, and made a rent in her cloaths. Buller J. was of opinion, that the case was within the Act, on the ground that the intent was to wound by cutting through the cloaths, and therefore the party must have intended to cut the cloaths, and relied on the case of Coke and Woodburne, on the Coventry Act, 22 and 23

Charles II. c. 1. (ante, No. 24); but the majority of the judges were of a different opinion, and thought, that to bring the case within the Act, the primary intention must be to injure the cloaths. The case was ultimately decided upon an objection to the indictment, which alledged that the defendant on the 18th of January, did assault, with intent, &c. and on the said 18th day of^January, did cut, &c. not saying “ at the same time” or “ then and there, ” so that it might have been a different cut on the same day; 1 East, P. C. ch. 8. § 18; Leach, case 239. The prisoner was afterwards tried and convicted upon several indictments for assaults.

trees, and other illegal practices, and have, in great numbers, armed with

swords, fire-arms, and other offensive weapons, several of them with their faces blacked, or in disguised habits, unlawfully hunted in forests belonging to his Majesty, and in the parks of divers of his Majesty’s subjects,

and destroyed, killed, and carried away the deer, robbed warrens, rivers,

and fish-ponds, and cut down plantations of trees; and have likewise solicited several of his Majesty’s subjects, with promises of money, or other c rewards, to join with them, and have sent letters in fictitious names, to several persons, demanding venison and money, and threatening some great

violence, if such their unlawful demands should be refused, or if they should be interrupted in, or prosecuted for such their wicked practices, and have ' actually done great damage to several persons, who have either refused to comply with such demands, or have endeavoured to bring them to justice,

to the great terror of his Majesty’s peaceable subjects:* For the preventing which wicked and unlawful practices, Be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That if any person or persons, from and after the first day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twenty-three, being armed with swords, fire-arms, or other offensive weapons, and having his or their faces blacked, or being otherwise disguised, shall appear in any forest, chase, park, paddock, or grounds inclosed with any wall, pale, or other fence, wherein any deer have been or shall be usually kept, or m any warren or place where hares or conies have been or shall be usually kept, or in any high road, open heath, common or down, or shall unlawfully and wilfully hunt, wound, kill, destroy, or steal any red or fallow deer, or unlawftilly rob any warren or place where conies or hares are usually kept, or shall unlawfully steal or take away any fish out of any river or pond; or if any person or persons(l), from and after the said first day of June, shall unlawfully and wilmlly hunt, wound, kill, destroy or steal any red or fallow deer, fed or kept in any places in any of his Majesty’s forests or chases, which are or shall be inclosed with pales, rails, or other fences, or in any park, paddock, or grounds inclosed, where deer have been or shall be usually kept(2); or shall unlawfully and maliciously break down the head or mound of any fish-pond, whereby the fish shall be lost or destroyed, or shall unlawfully and maliciously kill, maim or wound any cattle (3), or cut down or otherwise destroy any trees (4) planted in any avenue, or growing in any garden, orchard or plantation, for ornament, shelter or profit; or shall(5)

Persons disguised and in arms appearing in forest, &c. and killing deer, &c. deemed felons.

(1) It is agreed that the subsequent offences are within the provisions of the Act, whether the parties be armed and disguised, or not.

(2) This provbion was held, in Davies* case, Leach, case 225, to be repealed by stat. 16 Geo. III. c. 30, (post, Part VI. Class XIX. No. 44.) which subjects the same offence, in the first instance, to pecuniary penalties, and in the second, to transportation. By 42 Geo. III. c. 107. (post, Part VI. Class XIX. No. 47.) it is raaae a transportable felony in the first instance.

(3) An indictment for killing a horse, mare, &c. is sufficient within this clause, without averring them to be cattle; Paty’s case, 2 Bl. Rep. 721. The offence must be committed from malice towards the owner. The wounding a cow, with intent to commit bestiality, is not within the Act; Pearce’s case, Leach, case 237: nor a wounding a horse out of malice or passion towards the animal; Hone’s case, note, ibid.; Shepherd’s case, Lea^h, case 243. So cutting the legs of sheep that broke over an inclosure; E. P. C. 1073. But it is not necessary to prove a previous existing case against the owner; the fact of

R

malice being a question for the jury; Ranf er’s case, 1798. See E. P. C. c. 22. § 16.

n a late case of the'King and Dawson, at Cambridge Assizes, the prisoner was convicted and executed for destroying race horses at Newmarket, by putting poison into their watering troughs, for the purpose of preventing their running.

(4) For other provisions respecting the destruction of trees, see Part VI. Class XI.

(5) The words “ unlawfully and maliciously” are here omitted; but tt. whetbfey they are not necessary in an indictment ? Minton’s case, E. P. C. c. 21. & 5. — In an action against the hundred, it is sufficient to alledge the act to have been done feloniously, without adding “ unlawfully and maliciously; ” Allen. Hundred of Kirton, 3 Wils. 318. 2 Black. Rep. 842. Setting fire to paper in a building, with intent to burn the building, unless ttiere is an actual burning of the budding, or some part of it, does not amount to arson; Taylor's case, Leach, case 25. The burning a hous<\ or the outbuildings forming a parcel thereof, or a barn with corn or hay, is felony at common law; and the statutes only take away the benefit of clergy; 1 Hale, 567.

c. 22. place (8); or shall knowingly send (9) any letter(lO) without any name sub(1; A common gaol is a house within the meaning of the Act. In the different counts of the indictment it was described as the house of the gaoler, of the corporation to which it belonged, and of the person whom the gaoler suffered to live in the dwelling-house forming part of the building; Donovan’s case, 1770, Leach, case 37. At common law, and under this statute, the burning must be of the house, &c. of another to constitute arson; and the burning by a tenant for years, (H. v, Holmes, Cro. Car. 376, W. Jones, 351, Pedley’s case, 1 Leach, case 122, Breeme’s case, Leach, case 109,) or a mortgagor in possession, Leach, case 218, is not sufficient. Secus as to a woman merely entitled to do w’er, not assigned; Foster, 113; or a pauper put into a house, to live therein with his family, by the parish officers; Gow-en’s case, E. P. C. 1027: but by stat. 43 Geo. III. c. 58. (referred to post, inserted ante, Class IV.) a person setting fire to his own house, with intent to injure or defraud, is guilty of a capital offence. If a person had set fire to his own house, with intent to defraud the insurance, and the house of another was burnt, it was felony at common law, and within the present statute and and 5 Philip and Mary, c. 4.

(2) If the indictment charge the setting fire to a barn in the night-time, (which is requisite to constitute a felony under stat. 22 and 23 Car. II. c. 7.) the proof of the act being done in the night-time is not necessary; that fact being on this statute immaterial; Minton’s case, E. P. C. ch. 21. § 5.

(3) The indictment may be for setting fire to an out-house, although the building is so connected with the dwelling-house as to form part of it in point of law, being a detached building in the same yard; North’s case, E. P. C. ch. 21. § 5.

(4) The prisoner was .bailed upon a commitment for setting fire to a parcel of unthrashed wheat, as not being felony within the statute; Judd’s case, 2 T. R. 255.

(5) The indictment must charge the offence to be committed wilfully and maliciously, as well as feloniously; R. v. Davies, 1 E. P. C. ch. 8. §8.

(6) The offence, to come within this statute, must be committed under such circumstances as would amount to murder if death had ensued; 4 Bl. Com. 207; Gastineaux’s case, E. P. C. ch. 8. § 6.

(7) The shooting in the dark, in a different direction from that in which the person intended to be shot at is going, is not w ithin the Act; Empson’s case, E. P. C. ch. 8. §. 6. Where severarl wrere riotously assembled, and attacked a house with loaded guns, and one shot at A. B.; on the others being present, it was ruled that they were all guilty as principals, and they were executed; the eoalheaver’s case, Leach, case 35. R. acc. all the judges in Well s case, E, P. C. ch. 8.

§ 7. In that case the prisoner was charged in one count as shooting, in another as aiding and abetting. In Rext?. Gibson and two others, upon an indictment against them for shooting, it was moved in arrest of judgment, that three could not be guilty of the same act of shooting. Eyre B., in the conference of the judges, said they might, if a string were tied to a trigger, and they all pulled it. No judgment was given; (the only prisoner found guilty having been convicted of another capital offence) and the profession would have suffered no loss if this childish conceit had never been recorded. If it is settled, that under a charge for doing an act, a person may be convicted for acting as principal in the second degree, there is no inconsistency in al-lodging an act to be done by several, which could, in its immediate operation, be only committed by one; and the legal construction of the averment is only that they had done such acts as subjected them to be punished as principals in the offence. Upon this ground, in a case at Chester spring assizes, 1813, a motion in arrear of judgment was overruled, upon an indictment chargingthree persons jointly with the commission of a rape. The execution was respited, probably w'ith a view to enable the learned judges to consult other authorities on the accuracy of their opinion; and the prisoners were afterwards executed.

See further, as to the offence of shooting, &c. stat. 43 Geo. III. c. 58. inserted ante. Class IV.

(8) In Durore’s case, Leach, case 171, a mistake in the name of the person in whose house the offence was said to be committed, was held to be fatal, although the averment of a particular place might not have been necessary. But Q. if the variance would now be held material ? A mistake in the name of a person in w hose house a robbery is alledged to be committed is not material; Pye’s case and Johnstone’s case; 2 E. P. C. 786.

A person shooting in his own house is within the Act; R. n. Harris, 1 E. P. C. 415. It is said in Leach, 4th edit. «. to Durore’s case, supra, that in Harris’s case the name was wrong stated.

(9) A person carrying or delivering a letter is not within the Act. Where the wife wrote the letter, which was delivered by the husband, who was privy to the contents— ruled that neither could be found guilty; Hammond’s case, Leach, c. 206. The putting a letter in a place where it is likely to be seen and read by the person for whom it is intended; or to be found by some other person who will forward it to him, seems to be a sufficient sending; vi. E.P. C. ch. 23. §5. note. Sending by the post also seems sufficient; ibid. § 4. It does not seem necessary to aver, that the letter was sent to the person to whom it is directed; Lloyd’s case, ibid. § 5.

(10) The contents of the letter must be set

Class VI.] Biot, 8fc.

scribed thereto (l) or signed with a fictitious nrnne, demanding (2) money, venison, or other valuable thing (3); or shall forcibly rescue any person being lawfully in custody of any officer or other person for any of the offences before mentioned; or if any person or persons shall, by gift or promise of money, or other reward, procure any of his Majesty’s subjects to join him or them in any such unlawful act; every person so offending, being thereof lawfully convicted, shall be adjudged guilty of felony, and shall suffer death as in cases of felony, without benefit of clergy.

II. And whereas notwithstanding the laws now in force against the illegal practices above mentioned, and his Majesty’s royal proclamation on

the second day of February which was in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twenty-two, notifying the same, many wicked and

evil-disposed persons have, in open defiance thereof, been guilty of several

of the offences before mentioned, to the great disturbance of the publick

peace, and damage of divers of his Majesty’s good subjects.’ It is hereby enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all and every person and persons who since the second day of February in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twenty-two have committed or been guilty of any of the offences aforesaid, who shall not surrender him, her, or themselves, before the twenty-fourth day of July in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twenty-three, to any of the justices of his Majesty’s Court of King’s Bench, or to any one of his Majesty’s justices of the peace, in and for the county where he, she, or they did commit such offence or offences, and voluntarily make a full confession thereof to such justice, and a true discovery upon nis, her, or their oath or oaths, of the persons who were his, her, or their accomplices in any of the said offences, by giving a true account of their names, occupations, and places of abode, and to the best of his, her, or their knowledge or belief, discover where they may be found, in order to be brought to justice, being thereof lawfully convicted, shall be adjudged guilty of felony, and shall suffer death as in cases of felony, without benefit of clergy.

III. Provided nevertheless, That all and every person and persons, who

out in the indictment; Lloyd’s case, E. P. C. ch. 23. § 5.

(1) A letter without a name, in the prisoner’s common hand-writing, sent to a person acquainted with the character of such writing, and from the contents plainly shewing who was the writer, so that there was no intention of concealment, ruled not to be within the Act; Heming’s case, E. P. C. ch. 23. § 2.

(2) See Robinson’s case, E. P. C. ch. 23. § 2. Leach, case 294, as to what kind of a letter shall amount to a demand. The letter in question contained terms of request, and intimated a threat to publish a libel, charging the prosecutor with murder, if the request was not complied with, (which intention was found by the jury,) and the case was ruled to be within the Act: other letters from the prisoner, previous to the one upon which the indictment was framed, Were admitted in evidence, explaining the letter in question.

(3) In Robinson’s case, Leach, case 294. ch. 23. §2, it was objected, that a Bank-note was not a valuable thing within the meaning of the Act, because at the time w hen the Act was passed it could not be the subject of larceny. Bullcr J. in delivering the judgment, said, “ that the judges were all of opinion, that if the thing demanded be valuable at the time that the demand is made, that is sufficient, though the thing demanded did not exist, or the value of it was not known when

the statute was made. But in truth it was a valuable thing at the time when the statute was made, although it might not come under the denomination of goods and chattels, or be the subject of larceny, for it w as evidence of a debt: it might at any time be turned into cash, and was, to the owner, of the value of the money for which it was given.” In Bernard’s case, for sending a threatening letter to the Duke of Marlborough, which at the time excited great public attention, the charge in the indictment was for demanding a valuable thing, to wit, a gented subsistence for life. The prisoner was acquitted upon the merits, and the validity of the indictment did not come directly in question. The indictment in that case would be now held bad, for not setting out the letter.

several turnpike gates and houses, which have been erected by the authority of several Acts of Parliament, made for repairing divers roads within

this kingdom, by tolls taken or to be taken at such turnpikes, and thereby

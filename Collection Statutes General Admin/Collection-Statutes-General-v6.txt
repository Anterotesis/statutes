(1) This statute is more general than 1 E.

VI. c. IS. § 12. which confines the description of the offence to the robbing any person in or near the highway; E. P. C. ch. 16. § 138.

(s) The better opinion seems to be, that the taking must amount to grand larceny in respect of value, unless done in the presence of some person, so as to amount to robbery; LP.C.ch. 16. § 70.

(3) The indictment must alledge a putting is fear fry Ike prisoners j R. r. Etherington and Brook, E. P. C. cb. 16. § 71.

(4) There must be e breaking, such as in the night would constitute burglary; but it if not necessary to alledge violence to the persons in the house; E. P. C. ch. 16. § 72. tad authorities there cited.

(j) This is more general than stat. 5 and 6 Edward VI. r. 9. sopra, which only empties to the eases of the owner, his wife, eUldfcn sr servants being within the house; E. P. C. eb. 16.^72.

(6) Q. Whether a person present and assisting can be charged as a principal, or must be expressly indicted as an aider and abettor, •ader this Act; 2 Hale, 346; Foster, 330; E. P. C. eh 16. § 68. 73.75. But see Rex o. Towle, t Hawk. 466. (on 53 Geo. Ill, c. 58.) |

Rex v. Royce, 4 Bur. 2073. (on stat. 1 Geo. st. 2. c. 5.) See the last class, and the Coal-heavers’ case, Leach, case 35. (on 9 Geo. c. 42. for shooting) from which it would appear to follow as a general role, that persons present and assisting may, in all cases not affected by a very particular penning of the statute enacting the offence, be charged as principals.

(7) It seems that the statute, having ousted the accessaries before of clergy, mast necessarily, and by implication, oast the principals. See t Hale, 346; Fost. 330; E. P. C. ch. 16. §68.73. 76.

(8) The. course now is merely to disallow the challenges.

(9) The goods which the party has in the county where convicted roust exceed the value of l2d.; as otherwise he can only have judgment for petty larceny; and the statute does not create a new felony. See E. P. C. ch. 16. § 157.

(10) As to the mode of charging or proving the fact of robbery, &c. in another county, in respect of which the offender is to be ousted of clergy, see E. P. C. ch. 16. § 157.

IV. And forasmuch as thieves and robbers are much encouraged to

* commit such offences, because a great number of persons make it their 1 trade and business to deal in the buying of stolen goods:’ Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons shall buy or receive any goods or chattel that shall be feloniously taken or stolen from any other person, knowing the same to be stolen, he or they shall be taken and deemed an accessary or accessaries to such felony after the feet, and shall incur the same punishment, as an accessary or accessaries to the felony after the felony committed (l).

V. And whereas it is a frequdnt practice for idle and disorderly persons

* to hire lodgings with an intent to have an opportunity to take away, im- beril, or purloin the goods and furniture being in such lodgings(s): Be it therefore enacted and declared (5) by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons shall take away, with an intent to steal, imbezil, or purloin, any chattel, bedding, or furniture, which by contract or agreement be or they are to use, or shall be let to him or them to use, in or with such lodging (4), such taking, imbezilling, or purloining, shall be to all intents and purposes taken, reputed, and adjudged to be larceny and felony, and the offender shall suffer as in case of felony.

VI. And whereas by the law of this realm, women convicted of felony for stealing of goods and chattel of the value of ten shillings and upwards, ana for other felonies, where a man is to have the benefit of ms clergy, are to* suffer death* Be it therefore enacted and declared by the authority aforesaid, That where a man being convicted of any felony for which he may demand the benefit of his clergy, if a woman be convicted for the same or like offence, upon her prayer tp have the benefit of this statute, judgment of death shall not be given against her upon such conviction, or execution awarded upon any outlawry for such offence, but shall suffer the same punishment as a man should suffer, that has the benefit of his clergy allowed him in the like case; that is to say, shall be burnt in the hand by the gaoler in open Court, and further be kept in prison for such time as the justices in their discretion shall think fit, so os the same do not exceed one year’s imprisonment.

VII. And forasmuch as such men who have once had their clergy, and such women who shall have once the benefit of this statute, may happen to be indicted for an offence committed afterwards in some other county: ’

Be it therefore enacted. That the clerk of the crown, clerk of the peace, i clerk of the assizes, where such man or woman shall be convicted, shall at the request of the prosecutor, or any other in their Majesties’ behalf, certify a transcript, briefly and in few words containing the effect and tenor

(1) This, with the other provisions respecting stolen goods, will form the subject of the following class.

(t) In Rivers’s case, 1 Hawk. cb. 33. $ 10. it was doubted whether a lodger purloining furniture was guilty of larceny; and in Rex «. Meares, 1 Sho. 50, 1 W. and M. it was ruled that he was not. But Q. Whether the contrary would not now be held, on the ground of the possession still continuing in the owner of the house?

(3) 8ir E. H. East says, that although this Is a declaratory Act, it must be construed with reference to the preamble, which recites that it was 44 a practice to hire lodgings, with intent, ” dec.; E. P. C. ch. 16. $ 38. But it has been held, in many cases, that the general operation of the enacting part of a clause should not be controlled by the preamble stating only a limited ground of complaint; although certainly there are cases the contrary way.

(4) An indictment was for stealing from a* lodging-house. The prisoner took the

entire house and furniture, and agreed to make good every thing which was missing; and the case was ruled not to be within the Act, which was meant to apply to the case where the owner had the possession of the house. It was also thought that the agreement to make good what wfts missing took the case out of the statute Palmer’s esse, E. P. C. cb. 16. § 36; Leach, case 384. An indictment for stealing the goods and chattels being in a certain lodging room in fee dwelling house of T. N., there situate, let by contract by the said T. N. to the said defendant, and to be used by the said defendant with the lodging aforesaid”—was sufficient; though objected that it was not stated that the goods were let at the time they were stolen; Burnell’s case, E. P. C. ch. 16. & 36. —The indictment must state by and to whom the lodgings were let; Pope’s case, ibid.—It has been frequently held, that an indictment could not be maintained on this Act agaiait a feme covert, taking the lodgings with her husband.

(1) A person not actually in the shop, but only waiting at the corner of the street to receive the goods, is n«t within this statute; Wild's case, note to Prinkwater’s case, Leach, Ca.7; Godfrey's case, Leach, Ca. 141.

(2) This means only a warehouse where goods are exposed to sale, and not a warehouse by the waterside, for receiving goods intended to be shipped; Howard’s case, Foster, 77; or the warehouse of a Black well-hail factor, where goods are received for sale oa commission, but not exposed as in shops; R. r. Godfrey, Leach, Ca. 141.

(3) If the person be detected, or even If lus coodoct excite suspicion, while he continues in the shop, Ac. c. it is thought sufficient to repel the charge of privately stealing.

(4/This extends only to goods of the trader exposed to sale in the shop or warehouse, or to things usually kept in coach-houses or stables; not to a shirt left in a mercer's shop to be sent to be washed; 8 Mod. 165; to a watch sent to a watch-maker's to be repaired, and being in the shew glass of the shop, not being there for sale; Stern's case, Leach, Ca. 163 j or livery coat of a coachman hung up in the stable; Foster, 78; Stone's case, Leach, Ca. 147.

(5) By this expression it would seem to be taken for granted, that if there had been a breaking, the offence would have been capital; but the opposite construction is fully established; Jones's case, E. P. C. ch. 16. *79.

(6) The several cases on this clause shew an uniform disposition, on the part of the judges, to give it the most confined construction which the language will by any possibility admit; and have ascribed to it, in judicial construction, a much more qualified object and intention than the preamble seems to warrant, 'l*he disposition of the executive power upon the subject is also manifested by the circumstance, that, dnringthe whole of the present reign, not more than one instance is known of the sentence having been carried into execution. These circumstances

VOL.VI.

certainly manifest a strong and united opinion of the general disproportion snbsisting between the offence and the punishment to which it is subjected; and it is admitted, that the sentence ought only to be carried into execution under very special and extraordinary circumstances: although certainly it does not seem to be a high recommendation of a law, that it ought not to be commonly executed. The circumstances of aggravation which sometimes induce the infliction of capital punishment, in cases of larceny under the authority of particular statutes, are usually such as are perfectly collateral to the ground of aggravation immediately contemplated by the statutes themselves, and might be equally applicable in cases of other larceny, in respect of which the extraordinary precaution does not apply. With respect to the influence of terror and example in preventing the commission of offences, the mere existence of an enactment in the statute book, never carried Into execution but under very extraordinary circumstances, is not likely to have much effect in preventing the commission of such crimes as are not distinguished from others not subject to the same consequence; as it is not the enactment of a law, but the probability of its execution which can be justly calculated upon, as having any impression on the conduct of those who may be tempted to commit the offence intended to be guarded against. Some attempts to repeal this and other statutable provisions for making larceny In particular cases a capital offence, have of late been the subject of considerable discussion. The principles of criminal law, as applicable to the particular subjects, have been expounded with the greatest ability; but the proposals have usually been resisted with success, as indicating a spirit of innovation, and a wish to deviate from the wisdom of oar ancestors. The proposal for abolishing the particular enactment to which the present note immediately applies, has met with more favourable reception than some ottr"

for, after a successful opposition in one or two sessions in the House of Commons, the bill for the repeal has been, in subsequent sessions, allowed to pass that Honse without comment or observation, and been successfully resisted, with almost as little comment or observation, in the House of Lords. To those who think the credit of their forefathers interested in the preservation of tills unexecuted law, it may be material to notice, that the severest punishment which, at the time of its enactment, could be inflicted on persons admitted to the benefit of clergy, was a burning in the hand and imprisonment for a year; and that transportation was first applied to cases of larceny by stat. 4 Geo. I. c. 11.

It would be foreign to the present purpose to enter into any discussion, whether the punishment of transportation ought to be continued, or relinquished agreeably to the recommendation of a report made by a committee of the House of Commons, a few days

before the committing these observations to the press. It most be admitted, that between capital punishment, and the other punishments, less than transportation, which can be now inflicted in cases of felony, there ought to be intermediate degrees; and whether transportation is retained, or a greater extension of the penitentiary system is substituted, I do not think that the particular qualities of the offence at present under consideration are such, as to render it less 'probable that the law will have its proper force and efficacy in respect‘of them, titan in respect of other cases which are admitted not to require so severe a remedy as the punishment of death.

See the several cases of Lyons and Miller, Holland, Thompson, Harris and Bavis. E. P. C. ch. 15. § 12. The Act is considered as being passed principally for the protection of the owner of the house, and is therefore held not to extend to a larceny committed by the owner or his wife. See the several cases of Mac Bonnet and Gould, E. P. C. ch. 16. §81. The Act also only extends to protect property usually kept or, deposited in the house, as distinguished from property under the protection of the person; and not to cases of ring-Uropping and other tricks amounting to larceny.

(1) One promissory note for the payment of Jive pounds is a sufficient description; Milner’s Case, E. P. C. ch. 16. 37. Vide Rex v. Box, 6 Taunt. 325.

(2) Where the prisoner by duress, and under a menace of death, compelled the prosecutor to sign a promissory note, previously written on a stamp brought by her to him for the purpose, it was ruled not to be a stealing within the Act; Phipoe’s Case, Leach, ca. 283.

(3) It is incorrect to describe the subjects above enumerated, as chattels; but the word may be rejected jas a surplusage; R. v. Sadi and Morris, E.P.C. ch.16. & 37. In the same case, E. P. C. ch. 16. 143, there was a difference of opinion amongst the judges, whether the receiving the articles mentioned in the statute was an offence within the Acts against receiving stolen goods; bat the majority were of opinion that it was not. Sir E. H. East suggests a doubt, whether this opinion was not overruled by Dean’s case, and other cases mentioned infr&, where stealing the property in question was held within the statutes taking away the benefit of clergy; but the cases

clearly stand on very different grounds; the one relating to the description of the proper. ty? as satisfying the words of the statutes against receivers—the other upon the conseauences attaching, under the immediate au-tiority of the present Act, to the offences included therein. And the late Sir Alexander Thomson, in a case in which I was counsel, expressly decided that an indictment could not be maintained ip such a case against a receiver.

(4) The stealing of these descriptions of property is ousted of clergy, under the Acts tor stealing in dwelling-houses; or in other .cases where particular larcenies are made capital by statute; Dean’s Case, Leach, ea. 283. E.P.C. ch. 16. § 83; Milnes’s Case, E. P. C. ch. 16. § 37.

167, notes. In the case of Jackson and Randall, on the present statute, E.P. C. ch. 8. § 13, the assault was stated to be made with an offensive weapon, called a wooden staff, and appeared on the evidence to be made by throwing a stone; the case being reserved fos the opinion of the judges, the variance was held not to be material, as the weapon laid, and that proved, wonid produce the same kind of mischief, viz. by blows and bruises; and the description would have been sufficient in an indictment for murder. This case (although the question turned on the mode of charging the offence in the indictment) necessarily proves a staff or a stone to be an offensive weapon within the Aet.

(1) An indictment for an assuult with intent, Ac. c. must charge it to he unlawfully and maliciously, as well as feloniously: this is not necessary in an indictment for a dnnand, as the act is in the disjunctive; Pcgge’s Case, E. P. C. ch. 8. § 12.

(2) A commitment for an assault with intent, Ac. c. not stating it to be made with a weapon, uor stating any demand by menaces, Ac. c. held not to be within the Act, and the defendant bailed; R. v. Remnant, 5 T. K. 169.

(3) An indictment that the defendant did assault, and did menace to blow ont the brains of the proseentor, with intent, Ac. c. is not sufficient. It must either state an assault with an offensive weapon, or that the defendant by menaces, or in a forcible or violent manner, did demand money, Ac. c. R. v. Jackson

and Randall, Leach, ca. 133; E. P. C. ch. 8.

(4) In Parfait’s Case, Leach, ca. 8. it was ruled, that holding a pistol to a coachman, and saying “ stop, ” was not within the Act; although it was admitted that the demand need not be with words. See observations on this case, E. P. C. ch. 8. § 11. where the decision is supposed to have turned upon the point mentioned n. (6) infra.

(A) Presenting a pistol to a person and binding him “ stop, ” and on his calling out for assistance, threatening to blow his brains out if he called out any more, was held sufficient to support an indictment for an assault with intent to rob; R. v. Trusty, E. P. C. ch. 8. § 11. A charge for an assault with a weapon, with intent the monies of the said A. B. from his person and against his will to steal, held not sufficient to charge an intent to rob; the prisoner was afterwards convicted on another indictment, charging an iutent viotmtfy to steal. It is not stated that any objection was made to the second indictment, for not using the word “rob, ” but it seems to be implied that that word wrfs not necessary. It wonid, however, be preferable to follow the words of the Act, and expressly charge an intent toro6.

OFFENCES RELATING TO STOLEN GOODS.

The statutes relating particularly to the receiving public tainetl in Class X. infra.

stores are con *

* It is observed in Rede’s Essay towards a free examination of the laws of England, Vol. II. p. 75. (apparently with much justice) that “ receiving stolen goods, is, perhaps, the most prominent evil in the whole penal code; ana that instead of the piecemeal system which has been from time to time adopted, on suggestions only applicable to particular cases, one general law should embrace every object, and remedy .every defect in the existing statutes. When (it is added) the receiver is in reality the greatest offender, and even the source from whence most burglaries and robberies have their origin, the

receipt of stolen goods should be made an original offence."

Certainly a general law, which provided in three lines—That receiving stolen goods, money bills, Ac. c., knowing them to be stolen, and whether the value did or did not amount to more than Is. should be felony, and that the offenders should be liable to be transported for«ny term not exceeding fourteen years; or to be punished by whipping, line, and imprisonment; or any one or more of such punishments, would seem to be much preferable to the present complicated system.

* persons, their friends and acquaintances, by colour whereof the said light

* and evil-disposed persons have deceitfully and unlawfully obtained and gotten great substance of money, goods, cattels and jewels into their

* hands and possession, contrary to right and conscience :*(ll

II. For reformation whereof be it ordained and enacted by authority of this present Parliament, That if any person or persons, of what estate or degree soever he or they be, at any tune after the first day of April next coming, falsly and deceitfully obtain or get into his or their hands or possession, any money, goods, cattels, jewels, or other things of any other person or persons, by colour and means of any such false (2) token or counterfeit letter made in any other man’s name (3), as is aforesaid, that then every person and persons so offending, and being thereof lawfully convict, by witnesses taken before the lord chancellor of England for the time being, or by examination of witnesses, or confession taken m the Star-Chamber at Westminster before the King’s most honourable council, or before the justices of assize in their circuits for the time being, or before the justices of peace within any part of the King’s dominions in their general sessions, or by action in any of the King’s courts of record, shall have and suffer such correction and punishment, by imprisonment of his body, setting upon the pillory, or otherwise by any corporal pain (except pains of death) as shall be unto him or them limited, adjudged, or appointed by the person or persons before whom he shall be so convict of the said offences, or of any of them, .

(1) It has been sometimes said, that this Act was made only in affirmance of the common law, which is agreed to be trne as to counterfeit letters; and it is also agreed, that cheats, by means of false tokens of a public nature, were an offence at common law; but the cheating by false privy tokens, seems, to be a newly created offence. See the observations'upon this subject, £• P. C. ch. 18.

(2) This, by. reference to the preamble, means privy token; which means a key, a ring, Ac. c. or some other real visible mark or thing, and not a mere false affirmation or promise; R.O. Munez, tStr. 1127.

(3) A draft in the defendant’s own name, upon a banker on whom he had no authority to draw, is not within the Act; R. v, Lava, 6T.R. 565.

II. And be it farther enacted by the authority aforesaid, Hiat any justice or justices of the peace of the county, riding, division, city, liberty or

might give credit, ” Btiller J. mentioned a case before himself and Moreton C. J. at Chester, where the defendant was convicted for pretending that be had been employed by the Dane ae Lauznn to take some horses from Ireland to London, and that he had been detained by contrary winds till his money was all spent; R. v. Young and others, ST. R. 96. A foreman supplied weekly with money to pay the other workmen their wages, upon delivering to the clerk, an account of the money earned, delivering in an account In the words following:—“ 9th September, 1796, Shearmen 442. lit.” and it appearing that he made false entries in a book kept by him, of persons employed, so as to make up the sum stated; was ruled by all the judges to be guilty within the Act, as he would not have obtained the credit but by the false account delivered in; Witchell’s Case. 1798, E. P. C. ch. 18. § 8. A carrier who had received goods under pretence of carrying them, and pretending feat he had carried and delivered them, ruled to be within the Act; R. to Airey, 2 East, 50. In R. e. Jackson, 3 Camp. 370. Bailey J. said it had been recently held by the judges, that it was an indictable offence fraudulently to obtain goods, by giving in payment a cheque upon a banker With whom the party keeps no cash, and which he knows wiH not be paid; and the prisoner was upon such fraud convicted, and sentenced to be transported. It is not sufficient to charge the obtaining by false pretences, without shewing what such

rtences were; R. v. Mason, 2 T. R. 581.

is sufficient to state, that the defendant pretended—by means of which false pretence he obtained—and thep to negative the truth of the pretences; R. t>. Airey, nb. snpriL It is not sufficient to alledge, that he felsely pretended, and, by means of such false pretence, obtained, without expressly negativing the truth of the pretences by special averment; and all the judges held that the averment of the falsehood of pretences, must be made with the same particularity as in case of an Indictment for forgery; R. v. Perrott, 2 M. and 8. 379. The effect of this decision would seem not to be confined to the mere form of the indictment; for if the assignment of fidsehood must be made with the same particularity as in fcn indictment for forgery, it Would apparently follow, that there most be the same particularity in the original pretence, which is requisite in a judicial proceeding; the sufficiency or insufficiency of which is often determined upon the evidence of its containing so distinct an assertion, as to admit of forgery being assigned thereon; whereas in the Aieats intended to be guarded against by the present Act, a great deal more is often understood than is positively exressed: for instance, to advert to Jackson's

ase, supra, there is no express and formal statement made by a person drawing a bill, that he has cash In the hands of the drawee; but the mere act of drawing the bill is considered as amounting to such a pretence: whereas in case of forgery, no indictment can be supported upon the mere understanding arising from any understanding or inferences, without there being in fact, as well as in allegation, an express and direct assertion of the facts charged to have been felsely sworn; in which respect there Is a failure of that analogy between the respective cases, which, in the case of the King v. Perrott, seems to have been taken for granted as deciding the law.

(1) Tills Act does not repeal the provisions respecting threatening letters, by 9 Geo. I. c. 22. ante, Class VI. No. 38. See Note, ibid.; but the judges were of opinion that an indictment could not be supported on this Act, if there was a demand; Robinson’s Case, Leach, Ca. 294. E. P. C. ch. 23.1 2-but mis opinion can only be understood as applying to cases falling In other respects within the statute 9 Geo. I. and not to cases where the letter is delivered by the defendant, or sigtfhd with areal name.

(2) A letter written with intent to procure the delivering up of a promissory note of the defendant, does not support an indictment charging an intent to extort money; R. to Major, Leach, Ca. 297; E. P, C. ch.?3.$3.

Part V. Class XII.

FORGERY *

• The following general view of the construction and operation of the several modern statutes respecting forgery is principally abridged from East's Pleas of the Crown, ch. 19. The points arising upon particular statutes included in the collection will also be noted in the proper places to-which they respectively belong.

Class XII.] Forgery. 91

la discussing the question, How far the validity in law of the thing forged, supposing it was true, is essential to forgery? Sir E. H. East (referring to Hawkins, ch. 70, $ 7.) observes, that it is said to be no way materia), whether a forged instrument be made in such a manner as, if it were true, it would be of any validity, or not; and adds, that he conceives this mast be understood, when the false instrument carries on the face of it the semblance of that for which it is counterfeited, and is not illegal in its very frame; and proceeds to notice die case of Deakins, 1 Sid. 149. for forging a protection in the name of one as being M. P. who was not so; of Japhet Crooke, 9 Str. 901. Fitxg. >57, 961. (indicted upon 5 Euz.) for forging a conveyance of lands by a false description, and sufficient, if genuine, to pass such (lands; and of Coogan, 9 Leach. Ca. 906. and Ball, MSS., and of Morphy and Stirling, therein cited, for forging the wills of persons not dead. The same observation applies to forging the names of fictitious persons, § 43.

It is sufficient to constitute a forgery, if there be such a degree of similitude as will impose upon persons not having particular experience in such matters; as where a person from the hank said that he could not have been imposed upon by the counterfeit; but it appeared that others had been deceived, though the counterfeits were very ill executed; R. e. Hood, before Le Blanc J., East, 1809. So where the forged bank note had no watermark; Elliot's case, 1777. Leach, Ca. 90, (East, § 44). But query, Whether there is any case where the mere unskfifulness of the execution, however great, will excuse a forgery, complete as to the terms and language of the Instrument, and committed with a felonious Intent? If the instrument forged Is not in its terms such as the indictment charges it to be, the case is not supported; as where an Instrument, stated in the indictment aa purporting to be a bank note, was a promise to pay for oe(f and company of m bank ta England; Jones's case, Leach, Ca. 103. Doug. 309. But a mistake in framing the instrument itself will not excuse, as where a forged will commenced “ I Peter Perry, 9 and was signed John Perry; Fitzgerald’s case, Leach, Ca. 9.

Forgery of a will, purporting to be a devise of land, attested only by two witnesses, not sufficient, without its appearing that there was only a chattel interest; Watt’s case, 1800: So of a bill of exchange for less than 51., not attested by a subscribing witness, or having the other requisites of 17 Geo. III. c. 30. (See ante Pt. III. Cl. IV. No. 3.) Secns as to the want of a stamp; Hawkeswood’s case, Leach, Ca. 199; Martin’s case, BASS, Jnd.; or as to a collateral objection, as when an order for payment of prise-money bore date when the teaman was within seven miles of the port of discharge, ana would therefore be void by 39 Geo. III. ch. 34, 9; Me. Intosh’s case, 1800, MSS. Jua. ft 45).

With respect to the name in which the forgery is committea, it is now settled that the use of a ficticious name is a forgery, as well as the assumption of the name of an existing person. This was determined in the case of Aaron Lewis, O. B. 1754, for forging a deed purporting to be a warrant of attorney from Elizabeth Tough, Administratrix of It Tough, deceased, to receive prize-money; there being no such person as Elisabeth Tough in existence; Foster, C. L. 116. So in the case of Bolland, (1772) who, having indorsed a real note in his own name, was told by Jeuett, the person employed to negotiate it, that he should not be able to indorse it with his f Bolland's) name. [Bolland was a well-known character as a sheriff's officer.] Upon which he said he would take his name off, and another person began erasing it, and the name being erased except the letter B, the prisoner said—M Don’t scratch it all out: it may disfigure or cancel the note. I will think of some other name that begins with a B.” And immediately made the name Banks, and directed Jeueit to say that Banks kept a public-house in Rathbone-place. So in Lackett’s case, 1779, Leach, Ca. 53. where the prisoner gave a draft on a banking house in a fictitious name. It is also agreed ta he immaterial whether the prisoner gained any additional credit by using the false name; as where a person offered to discount a bill which had been stolen, and the clerk offered to discount it if the prisoner would indorse it, that being the invariable rale of the house, and the prisoner Indorsed a fictitious name-—all the judges were of opinion that the case amounted to forgery; for though the fictitious signature was not necessary to the obtaining of the money, and the intent m writing the false name was only to conceal through whose hands the mU had passed, yet it was a fraud both on the owner and the person discounting; as the one lost the chance of tracing it, and the other the benefit of a real indorser; Taft's case, Leach, Ca. 88; E. P. C. ch. 19, $ 46.

So where a person who, by some means which did not appear, had obtained a bill indorsed in blank, prevailed on the drawee to pay it, upon being allowed discount, a few days before It became due, and Indorsed a receipt in a fictitious name; although it was objected that the receipt was unnecessary, the possession of the bill being a sufficient discharge to the payer, which was not strengthened by the words written by the prisoner; and consequently the act of the prisoner was of no effect; Taylor’s case, Leach, Ca. 106; E. P. C. ch. 19.

146. And in Shepherd's case, 1781, the prisoner^*as convicted of forgery, in drawing, in afietitient name, upon a bank which had no account with any person orthe name assumed; Leach. Ca. 113: E. P. C. ch. 19, § 50.

In the case or Eliz. Dunn, 1765. the prisoner calling herself Mary Wallace, and pretending to be the widow of John Wallace, a seaman, deceased, applied to Harper, (a prise agent) to advance bar money to pay the fees of her husband's will. She returned with a

99 . Forgery. [Part V.

probate, and prodoeed a certificate that the was the Mary Wallace nantgd la the will, %pad put her mark to a promissory note for the money lent, directing the prosecutor to write the name Mary Wallace. Judgment was respited on a doubt whether, as the note, thought made by the prisoner in an assumed name, was her own note, made and offered as her own, and not as the note of another In contradistinction to herself, the offence amounted to a forgery $ which nine judges, dissentieate Aston, (two being absent) held that it did; Leads, Ca. SC; East, $49. In the opinion of the judges, as stated in Leach, it seems to be assumed, (contrary to the express determination in subsequent cases) that a person borrowing money upon his own note, and merely assuming a fictitious name without any relation to a different person, is not guilty of forgery; 4* for (it is said) there the whole credit is given to the party himself: the latter accepted the security of that person only; he has no other remedy in view but merely against the man he is dealing with, and the security itself Is really and truly the instrument; of the party whose act it purports to be, however subscribed by a fictitious name c he has therefore a remedy upon it against the person on whose credit he took h, and consequently is not substantially defrauded." The case, as warranting a conviction, is put upon the footing of the prisoner assuming the character of executrix of Wallace, a real person, actually entitled to wages. The judges also referred to the authority of Urn above-mentioned case of Aaron Lewis, where there had been such a person as Richard Tough, who was really entitled to the prize-money which it was the object of the forgery to obtain* Sir E* H. East, in referring to the case upon the authority of MS. (being the notes of Mr. Justice Yates, interleaved in the summary of Hale's Pleas of the Crown), states the following principles as laid down in the case:—1st. That if a person give a note or other security as his own note or security, and the credit thereupon be personal to himself, without any relation to another, his signing such a note with a fictitious name may indeed be a cheat, bat will not amount to a forgery; for in that case it is really-the instrument of the party whose acts it purports to be, and the creditor had no other security in view. But 2d. If a note had been given in the name of another person either really existing or represented so to be, and in that light to obtain a superior credit, or induce a trust which would not have been given to the party himself, it is then a false instrument, and punishable as forgery. 3dL That the law wonid be the same, though the note or security was thus falsely subscribed la the presence of him who lent his money upon it, if the impostor and the party whose aeme is made use of were bath strangers to him; for then he would not know that such impostor was nst really the person whose name he assumed, and therefore be would be equally deceived. Sir E. H. East, having cited this passage, says—“ Haw far the first proposition above tsM down is to be taken in its utmost latitude, has been the subject of much difference of opinion, which he should proceed to consider, pursuing the subject by steps/ ’

I apprehend, however, that the subsequent examination is beside the question agitated in thecas of Eiiz. Dunn; the real question fn that case being, Whether the signing a name by the prisoner, not her own, in the preseaoe of the person intended to be detrended, was to {redeemed forgery, when the false name was used with referenoe to the real name of a deceased person, who had an actual right to certain property, to respect of which thefiraud was intended to be committed ? there having at that time been no decision that the mere signet ore of a fictitious .name to a given instrument, without more, was sufficient to nenatt-tote that dfcace; and the object erf* the observation was to distinguish the particular oaoe in which the name falsely assumed had relation to areally existing character ton that of tbfe same fictitious signature, unaccompanied by special nirrnmii inures. The general proposition, that the ase of a mere fictitious name was in itself sufficient to oonstitsito foqgery. Was first established in BoftanfTs case, before which time ft woald certainly have ndarifttod of very serious doubt; and the txratraiy, already observed, is talcebfor greatod m the case last examined* But after the oilier authorities, by which it is osmpletcly settled that such a case was within the acts respecting forgery, it woaM have heen quite suffiomt to have drawn tbaft the prisoner, with a fraudulent inteet, signed promissory dote in the name of Maty Wallace; «*d ft would have been perfeotty unnecessary to report to the additional dredratanee of the frendutont ohaeot being to obtain credit in rovpedtofmcmtywatuaHy doe to the deceased, John Wdlsee, of whom Mary was fcfeely uttedged to be thercprtasntelire.

<A person may be gailty of fingery m signing his own name, by assuming to be a different person of the same name; as when a bill of exchange, payable to J. .cemes into ehe lands of a person heaving that name, who, knowing that he is not the pason intended ns payee, indorses it ffoio any other onto, where the instrument imports to he that of a pmtimUnr fnfiiridnal, different from the person by whom at Is subscribed. See Meado. Young, 4 T. It. 28. In the case of Parses o. Brown, 1796, ft was held by the judges, that a note dated MmytoP, £alop, parable at Messrs. D.T.and Co.’s banket *, London, nod mgtaod fflms. ferodm (the name one of the prisoners), waft afoigery, although no partied ar ptouon of that name was attended to berepreseiWed. The ground of the jadgnmBt was, fimt the pardon in whose name the note was mode was, according to the Ascription sn the mote, resident at Kington, and it imported that he was a correspondent of D.T. and On. and had hmfcy in their hands; ad he wto also represented as a brother of the prisoners no

vpM very questionable principles. As to the last gissnd stated, of a false representation In passing the note, it is clear that, unless the Instrument was I forgery in Its UMseption, It canid not be made so by subsequent representation; ami in Hevey’s case, E. P - C. ch. 19, $5; Leach, case 115, when an instrument was In the name of M'Carty, and it was found fay the jury to hare been made by a person of that name, the false representation of the prisoner, that he was the person so named, was ruled not to support an indictment for forgery. It surely cannot be said that drawing a bill upon a house with which the drawer has no

, or making a note payable at a house where he has no effects, can be considered a forgery; and the only remaining question is, whether dating it at a place different from the residence of the person signing is sufficient to make it such. In a'case at Lancaster, about the year 1807, before Chambre J. where a bill by the prisoner, D. Walker) who was a pan-per at Manchester), was dated Liverpool, signed D. Walker and Co. and drawn on De-vaynes and Co. London, it appeared that similar bills had bean before drawn in the same manner, and being provided for before due, had been regularly paid, although the drawer was unknown to the house, the above case was cited as an authority; hot the learned judge ruled that the evidence was not sufficient to go to the jury.

In the ease of Aickles, 1787, Leach, Cm; 802; E: P. C. ch. 19. $.50, the prisoner hnd taken a house in the name of Mason, in which name he drew the bill alledged to be forged, and the jury expressly found that he assumed the name for the purpose of committing the particular fraud, there was a difference of opinion amongst the judges; and, by mistake. Mr. J. Ashnrst gave judgment at the O. B. that it was not a forgery; conceiving that it had been so decided. But It may be difficult to admit that the case involved any real ground of doabt, when the specific fraudulent intention was expressly found, and the taking the house was only a part of the machinery of the fraud. It was observed by Gould J.—M that he made the note m the name of another, as if his own, and clearly with intent to defraud. Whether there existed a person of that name or not was immaterial: the felony consisted in the intent to defraud Under, the falsity. One might assume a feigned name, and make a draft In fit, and yet innocently, as if he concealed himself to avoid arrest, and appointed

his friend on whom he drew, to pay his bills; or, giving notes, took care to nay them when due; but the prisoner having no such intention, but, on the contrary, to defraud the party by making the note under such (tisgmsed name, by which, after he left the place of concealment, he could not be traced, the case amounted to forgery.” Sir E. H. East coaMients upon this case at length, and says, that he cannot help suspecting that much of the difficulty in those cases arises worn mistaking matters of fact for matters of law, and confounding the two together. And this seems to be the true view of the case; for if the use of the assumed name is intended to commit a fraud in the particular instance, there is no reason for qat treating it as a forgery, although that may only be part of a more general system of fraud, which such assumption is intended to carry into effect. In the case of Hadtield, at Carlisle, 1803, the prisoner bad appeared in the neighbourhood of the Lakes hi Cumberland, pretending to be the Hon. Alexander Augustus Hope, brother of* the Earl of Hopotouur and in that name induced a young woman to marry him, and imposed upon several persona in the neighbourhood. During his residence he drew the bill in question, upon a gentleman to whom he was known by that name, which probably would have been paid, if the grand deception bad not in the mean time been discovered. For this forgery he was convicted and executed; bat a material Ingredient in the ease was bis assuming the name and character of a really existing person.

The Indictment must set out the forged iaeftrnmeat in words and figures; and it la net sufficient to state the purport of it; Mason’s case, E. P. C. ch. 19. § 53. It is sufficient to charge the prisoner with forcing a given instrument, aofoUowo; setting out the tenor; R. o. PoweH. 9 Bl. Rep. 787; and tins is now the constant form of the indictments preferred on fbe part of the Bank of Engtand. But the setting oat the act forged is not in all cai

dent, as it may'be necessary to shew, by relation to some other subject, that the forgery is of

one of the instruments mentioned in the statutes. In Hunter’s ease, Ef.P.C. oh. 19. 436; Leach, Ca. *73. the indictment stated that the prisoner, being in possession of a navy Dill, (which was set forth) forged a receipt as foHowv, vis. “ Wm. Therntoowhich was helden to be not sufficient; though the name, coupled with the navy bill, might together form a receipt: bat then it ought to be so stated, as in a ease referred to in C. C. C. wherein it was stated that the prisoner, H. P. having in his custody a certain warrant (particularly mentioned) for payment of 81. to W. D. on the back of which warrant W. D. had signedhis name, which md warrant, together with the oaid indoreement, did purport to he a receipt under the hand of tkctmd W.B. for the oaid earn of 81., the said H. P. did feloniously alter, icc. In Yastiek’s case, E. P. C. ch. 19. $ 36. the i .*Um: 44 Received the contents

setting out the account to which the receipt was subjoined.

Where the radSctmeut contained the word received instead of record, in the I produced, the variation was held to he not material, as tt did not change the word. The question was said to be as to the word; not the letter; unless by addition, omission, or alteration it becomes another word. Hart’s case, BIS. Crown Cas. Res. 57 j E. P. C. eh. If. 154; Leach, Ca. 78.

I 36. the indictment charged the forging a receipt for money, e« fol-contents above, by me, . W.” which was held sufficient, without

94 forgery. [Part V.

An Indictment for forging ah in.trament U supported by proving an alteration in any material part, aa by changing a figure, or altering the sum in letters; Dawsen's case, 3 Geo.

I.; 1 Str. 19.; Teague’s case, 1802; £. P. C. ch. 19. 4 55. 'But it is more usual, at least inr one count, to lay the forgery as an alteration, specifying the particulars.

An indictment may charge the prisoner with forging a writing, purporting to be an instrument of a particular kind; Beech and Martin's case, 2 BL Rep. 790:but if.the writing upon the face of it is not sneh as (he indictment states the purport to be, the indictment cannot be sustained; as where the indictment was for forging a bill purporting to be directed to one John King by the name of Ring, and the name Ring only appeared in the bill, although King was the person interested; Reading's case, E. P. C. ch. 19. $ 56. Leach, Ca. 804.

So when the charge was for forging an order, purporting to be directed to O. Lord Kln-naird, Wm. Morland, Ac. c. by the description of Messrs. Ransom, Morland and Hammersley, and the tenor set out was of a bill directed to R. M. and H. the judgment was arrested, because the word purport imports what appears on the face of the instrument: it means the apparent, and not the legal import; GiUchrist’s case, East, ubi supra; Leach, Ca. 280. (In fact Lord K. and the other persons mentioned were bankers, under the firm of R. M. and H.) So Edsall’s case, East, ibid, where the purport of a forged bill was in like manner stated, with the actual names of the drawers, and not with the name of the firm, as appearing on the face of the -bill.

The Indictment 'must specify the nature of the instrument forged. Where an indictment for forging an obligation in a certain sum, without a condition, described it as a bead.and writing obtigaiory, it was objected, that it ought to have been called a writing obligatory; having neither a defeazance nor penalty annexed to it; and that, although a bond was a writing obligatory, yet the converse did not hold. The judges held the conviction right; Dunnetf s case, East, § 58. It.is stated in East, as an inference from this case, that a superfluous description does not appear to be objectionable: but I am by no means satisfied that the term bond is not properly applicable to an obligation without a condition, although, for the sake of distinction, it is more usually called a single bill. See 2 Bl. Com. 840.

An indictment may be maintained.on the 2d. Geo. II. stating that the prisoner did feloniously alter, .by forging and adding a cypher, although the word aHer is not in that statnte; the words being “shall falsely make, forge and counterfeitbut the indictment was admitted to be rather informal; Elsworth’s case, E. P. C. ibid.

The indictment must alledge an intent to defraud some person or persons, or by 18 Geo.

III. c. 18. some corporation; but it need not appear how the Act was to operate in fraud of such person or corporation, although they may not be mentioned in the writing forged; that being matter of evidence; Powell’s case, E. P. C, cb. 19? § 59.; Elsworth’s case, ibid.— There are always several counts in the indictment, charging an intent to defraud all such persons or bodies corporate as conld be affected by the success of the forgery; but as the intention to commit a fraud at the time of the forgery is nsually general, ana intended to impose rather upon the person to whom the forged instrument may be accidentally offered, (particularly in the case of bank notes and negociable instruments) I think it would be desirable to pass an Act, rendering it unnecessary to state the name of any person or corporation intended to be defrauded.

With regard to the evidence, an indictment for forging a receipt, with an intent to defraud A. B. C. Ac. c. stewards of the fund of the sons of the clergy, was sustained by proof of forging an indenture of apprenticeship, with a receipt for the premium, in order to obtain the assistance which the stewards are appointed to distribute; Jones and Pullen’s case, Leach, Ca. 168.—An indictment for forgery can only be sustained in the county where the forgery is actually committed, which is a question for the jury; but there must he some proof to warrant the conclusion. See Parke's case, E. P. C. ch. 19. § 61. In that cafe there was no proof, except an uttering by the prisoner's confederate.—I remember a case at Lancaster, In the year 1798, where a clerk of a mercantile honse at Liverpool, had stolen several bills, and was afterwards apprehended on board a sloop in the powns, with a forged indorsement of the drawee on one of the bill's; and Rooke J. without any evidence to shew a greater probability of the forgery being committed in Lancashire than in any intermediate county, thought there was enough to go to the Jury, who, however acquited the prisoner.

A confederate cannot be convicted of altering, unless present, or so near as to be able to aid and assist; So&re’s and Atkinson's case, E. P. C. ch. 19, § 52.

By several cases it is established, that a person whose name is forged, and who could have any interest in invalidating the instrument, if genuine, is an incompetent witness to prove the forgery. See the cases upon the subject, East, ch. 19. $ 61 to 68. Many persons nave doubted the correctness of this rale; and it certainly, in many cases, defeats the purKof justice. But where the party can have no interest, as a cashier of the bank, or a person whose will has been forged, (Newland’s, Coo gun’s, and Stirling's cases. East, ch. 19. $ 67, 68) the objection does not apply* And in a case of this kind, Gould and Yates, Justices, disallowed other evidence to be given of the hand-writing being forged, without positive evidence of the party being dead, although the forgery charged was of the writing •f a person resident in the West Indies; Smith’s case, E, P. C, ch. 19.$ 67. I am much inClass XII.] Forgery. 94

.rtined to think that sack objection would not now prevail; and in fact, the forger; of the signature* of clerks to the bank is constantly proved by other persons.

On account of the limited nature of the subjects, I think it is sufficient to refer generally to the cases of forgery mentioned in the several statutes following, viz.—Forgeries of instruments relating to the South Sea Company, by 9 Anne, c. 21. §67. 6 Geo. I. c. 11. § 60. Forgeries relating to the Hast India Company; the London and Royal Exchange Assurance, 6 Geo. I. c. 18; the Governor and CompanynfBritish Cut Plate Glass Manufactory, 38 Geo. III. e. 17; Forgeries relating to Stock created by the Parliament of Ireland, and of which the shares are transferable and dividends payable at the Bank of England, 36 Geo. III. c. 66, § 5; Contracts relating to the redemption of the land tax, 42 Geo. Ilf. c. 116. § 194; the register of births or baptisms of nominees in respect of annuities granted by 48 Geo. III. c. 142; the provisions by the several Acta respecting lotteries or exchequer bills, or other particular instruments; the memorials of register of deeds, under the authority of the Acta relating to Middlesex and the several ridings of Yorkshire; the forgery of instruments relating to the excise, by 46 Geo. III. c. 76; of the customs, by 46 Geo. III. c. 150. and several other cases; many of which particular provisions were originally, or have since become, unnecessary, as included in statutes of general operation.

Article the Third.—The high contracting powers having in view the immense extent of the shores of Africa to the north of the equator along which this commerce continues prohibited, and the facility thereby afforded for illicit traffic on points where either the total absence or at least the distance of lawful authorities bar ready access to those authorities, in order to prevent it, have agreed, for the more readily attaining the salutary end which they propose, to grant, and they do actually grant to each other the power without prejudice to the rights of sovereignty, to visit and detain, as if on the high seas, any vessel having slaves on board, even within cannon-shot of the shore of their respective territories on the continent of Africa to the north of the equator, in case of there being no local authorities to whom recourse might be had as has been stated in the preceding article.

tificate of emancipation, and shall be delivered over to the government on whose territory the commission which shall have so judged them shall be established, to be employed as servants or free labourers. Each of the two governments binds itself to guarantee the liberty of these individuals as shall be respectively consigned to it.

Article the eighth.—Every claim for compensation of losses occasioned to ships suspected of carrying on an illicit trade in slaves, not condemned as lawful prize by the mixed commission, shall also be heard and judged by the above-named commissions in the form provided by the third article of the present regulation; and in all cases wherein restitution shall be so decreed the commission shall award to the claimant or claimants or his or their lawful attorney or attornies, for his or their use, a just and complete indemnification for all costs of suit and for all losses and damages which the claimant or claimants may have actually sustained by such capture and detention; that is to say, in case of total loss the claimant or claimants shall be indemnified—first, for the ship, her tackle, apparel, and stores; secondly, for all freight due and payable; thirdly, for the value of the cargo of merchandize, if any; fourthly, for the slaves on board at the time of detention, according to the computed value of such slaves at the

I dace of destination, deducting therefrom the usual fair average mortality for the unexpired period of the regular voyage; deducting also for all charges and expences payable upon the sale of such cargoes, including commission of sale; and fifthly, tor all other regular charges in such cases of total loss: And in all other cases not of total loss, the claimant or claimants shall be indemnified—first, from all special damages and expences occasioned to the ship by the detention ana for loss of freight when due or payable; secondly, a demurrage when due according to the schedule annexed to the present article; thirdly, a.daily allowance for the subsistence of slaves, of one shilling or four reals and half de vor for each person without distinction of sex or.age, for so many days as it shall appear to the commission that the voyage has been or may be delayed by reason of such detention; as likewise, fourthly, for any deterioration of cargo or slaves; fifthly, for any diminution in the value of the cargo of slaves, proceeding from an increased mortality beyond the average amount of the voyage or from sickness occasioned by detention; this value to be ascertained by their computed price at the place of destination, as in the above case of total loss; sixthly, an allowance of five per cent. on the amount of the capital employed in the purchase and maintenance of cargo for the period of delay occasioned by the detention; and seventhly, for all premium of insurance on additional risks.

The claimant or claimants shall likewise be entitled to interest at the rate of five per cent. per annum on the sum awarded, until paid by government to which the capturing ship belongs; the whole amount of such indemnification being calculated in the money of the country to which the captured ship belongs, and to be liquidated at the exchange current at the time of award, excepting the sum for the subsistence of slaves, which shall be par, as above stipulated.

The two high contracting parties wishing to avoid as much as possible every species of fraud in the execution of the treaty of this date, have agreed, that if it should be proved in a manner evident to the conviction of the commissary judges or the two nations, and without having recourse to the decision of a commissioner of arbitration, that the captor has been led into error by a voluntary and reprehensible fault on the part of the captain of the detained ship; in that case only the detained ship shall not have the right of receiving, during the days of her detention, the demurrage stipulated by the present article.

Article the Second.—The two high contracting parties, for the more complete attainment of the object of preventing all traffic in slaves on the part of their respective subjects, mutually consent that the ships of their royal navies, which shall oe provided with special instructions for this purpose, as herein-after mentioned, may visit such merchant vessels of the two nations as may be suspected upon reasonable grounds of having slaves on board for an illicit traffic; ana in the event only of their finding such slaves on board, may detain and bring away such vessels, in order that they may be brought to trial before the tribunals established for this purpose, as shall herein-after be specified.

losses which their respective subjects may incur unjustly, by the aibitrary and illegal detention of their vessels; it being understood that this indemnity shall invariably be borne by the government whose cruizer shall have been guilty of the arbitrary detention; and that the visit and detention of ships specified in this article, shall only be effected by those British or Netherland vessels which may form part of the two royal navies, and by those ouly of such vessels which are provided with the special instructions annexed to the present treaty, in pursuance of the provisions thereof.

upon such notice, to go before any justice of the peace, or to enter into such recognizance, or shall be wilfully negligent in carrying on the said prosecution, he shall for every such offence forfeit the sum of twenty pounds to each of such inhabitants so giving notice as aforesaid.

VIII. And whereas, by reason of the many subtle and crafty contri* vances of persons keeping 'bawdy-houses, gaming-houses or other disor* derly houses, it is difficult to prove who is the real owner or keeper thereof, by which means many notorious offenders have escaped punish-.

* ment; * Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That any person who shall at any time hereafter appear, act or behave him or herself as master or mistress, or as the person having the care, government or management of any. bawdy-house, gaming-house or other disorderly house, snail be deemed and taken to be the keeper thereof, and shall beliable to be prosecuted and punished as such, notwithstanding he or she shall not in met be the real owner or keeper thereof.

X. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That no indictment which shall at any time after the said first day of June be preferred against any person for keeping a bawdy-house, gaming-house or other disorderly house, shall be removed by any writ of certiorari into any other court; but such indictment shall be heard, tried and finally determined^ at the same general or quarter-session or assizes, where such indictment shall have been preferred (unless the court shall think proper, upon cause shewn, to adjourn the same) any such writ or allowance thereof notwithstanding (1).

XI. And whereas many persons are deterred from prosecuting persons

* guilty of felony, upon account of the expence attending such prosecution,

* which is another great cause and encouragement of thefts ana robberies; * In order therefore to encourage the bringing offenders to justice. Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be in the power of the court, before whom any person has been tried and convicted of any grand or petit larceny, or other felony, at the prayer of the prosecutor, and on consideration of his circumstances, to order the treasurer of the county in which the offence shall have been committed, to pay unto such prosecutor such sum of money as to the said court shall seem reasonable, not exceeding the expences which it shall appear to the court the prosecutor was put unto in carrying on such prosecution, making him a reasonable allowance for his time and trouble therein; which order the clerk of assize, or clerk of the peace respectively, is hereby directed and required forthwith to make out and to deliver unto such prosecutor, upon being paid for the same the sum of one shilling, and no more; and the treasurer of the county is hereby authorized and required, upon sight of such order, forthwith to pay to such prosecutor, or other person authorized to receive the same, such sum of money as aforesaid, and shall be allowed the same in his accounts.

aXLII. And whereas for want of power in the court to order payment of the expences of any prosecution for a misdemeanor, many individuals are deterred by the expence from prosecuting persons guilty of misdemeanors, who thereby escape the punishment due to their offences; for remedy thereof, be it enacted, lhat where any prosecutor or other.person shall appear before any court on recognizance or subpoena, to prosecute or give evidence against any person indicted of any assault with intent to commit felony, of any attempt to commit felony, of any riot, of any misdemeanor, for receiving any stolen pro|>erty knowing the same to have been stolen, of any assault upon a peace officer in the execution of his duty, or upon any person acting in aid of such officer, of any neglect or breach of duty as a peace officer, of any assault committed in pursuance of any conspiracy to raise the rate of wages, of knowingly and designedly obtaining any property by false pretences, of wilful ana indecent exposure of the person, of wilful and corrupt perjury, or of subornation of perjury, every such court is hereby authorized and empowered to order payment of the costs, and expences of the prosecutor and witnesses for the prosecution, together with a compensation for their trouble and loss of time, in the same manner as courts are herein-before authorized and empowered to order the same in cases of felony; and, although no bill of indictment be preferred, it shall still be lawful for the court where any person shall have bona fide attended the court, in obedience to any such recognizance, to order payment of the expences of such person, together with a compensation for his or her trouble and loss of time, in the same manner as in cases of felony: Provided, that in cases of misdemeanor the power of ordering the payment of expences and compensation shall not extend to the attendance before the examining magistrate.

XXV. And whereas felonies anti such misdemeanors as are herein-before enumerated may be committed in liberties, franchises, cities, towns, and places which do not contribute to the payment of any county rate, some of which raise a rate in the nature of a county rate, and others have neither any such rate nor any fund applicable to similar purposes, and it is just that such liberties, franchises, cities, towns and places should be charged with all costs expences and compensations ordered by virtue of this Act, in respect of felonies and such misdemeanors committed therein respectively; be it therefore enacted, That all sums directed to be paid by virtue of this Act, in respect of felonies and of such misdemeanors as

such treasurer overseers or other officers respectively, instead of the treasurer of the county riding or division, as the case may require.

XXVI. And, for the better regulation of costs and expences in the cases Quarter Set-aforesaid, and for preventing abuses in respect thereof, be it enacted, p0n# n, a*6 That it shall be lawful for the justices of the peace of any county riding {oC'ortsaod or division, or of any liberty, franchise, city, town or place, chargeable Expenccg. with costs and expences under the~provi*ion aforesaid, in quarter sessions (igG.3. c. 19, assembled, to establish, and from time to time to alter such regulations g. 9.)

HERE AS it is expedient, with a view to improve the administration w of justice in criminal cases in Ireland, to define under what circumstances persons may be admitted to bail in cases of felony; and to make better provisions for taking examinations, informations, bailments, and recognizances, and returning the same tb the proper tribunals; and to relax in some instances the technical strictness of criminal proceedings, so as to ensure the punishment of the guilty without depriving the accused of any just means of defence; and to abolish the benefit of clergy and some matters of form which impede the due administration of justice; and to make better provisions for the punishment of offenders in certain cases: Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, ana Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That where any person shall be taken on a charge of felony, or suspicion of felony, before one or more justice or justices of the peace, and the charge shall be supported by positive and credible evidence of the fact, or by such evidence as if not explained or contradicted shall, in the opinion of the justice or justices, raise a strong presumption of the guilt of the person charged, such person shall be committed to prison by such justice or justices in the manner herein-after mentioned; but if there shall be only one justice present, and the whole evidence given before him shall be such as neither to raise a strong presumption of guilt, nor to warrant the dismissal of the charge, such justice shall order the person charged to be detained in custody, and such person shall be taken before two justices at the least; and where any person so taken, or any person in the first instance taken before two justices of the peace, shall be charged with felony, or on suspicion of felony, and the evidence given in support of the charge shall, in the opinion of such justices, not be such as to raise a strong presumption of the guilt of the person charged, and to require the committal of such person, or such evidence shall be adduced on behalf of the person charged as shall, in the opinion of such justices, weaken the presumption of guilt, but there shall, notwithstanding, appear to such justices, in either of such cases, to be sufficient ground for judicial enquinr into the guilt of the person charged, such person shall be admitted to ball by such two justices in the manner herein-after mentioned: Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to require any such justice or justices to hear evidence on behalf of any person so charged as aforesaid, unless it shall appear to such justice or justices to be meet and conducive to the ends of justice to hear the same.

II. And be it enacted, That two justices of the peace, before they shall admit to bail, and one or more justice or justices, before he or they shall commit to prison, any person arrested for felony or on suspicion of felony, shall take the examination of such person, and the information upon oath of those who shall know the facts and circumstances of the case, and shall put the same, or as much thereof as shall be material, into writing, and the two justices admitting to bail shall certify the bailment in writing; and every such justice shall have authority to summon any person within his jurisdiction, whom he shall have reason to consider capable of giving material evidence concerning any such felony or suspicion of felony, ana to examine such person oh oath touching the same, and to bind by recognizance all such persons as know or declare any thing material touching any such felony or suspicion of felony, to appear at ine next court of oyer and terminer or gaol delivery, or other court at which the trial of such offence is intended to be had, then and there to prosecute and give evidence against the party accused; and such justices and justice respectively shall

which such pardon shall be so granted: Provided always, that no free pardon, nor any such discharge in consequence thereof, nor any conditional pardon, nor the performance of the condition thereof, in any of the cases aforesaid, shall prevent or mitigate the punishment to which the offender might otherwise be lawfully sentenced on a subsequent conviction for any felony committed after the granting of any such pardon.

XXXIV. And whereas the practice of indiscriminately estreating recognizances for the appearance of persons to prosecute or give evidence, or to answer for a common assault, or in the other cases herein-after specified, has been found in many instances productive of hardship to persons who have entered into such recognizances; be it therefore enacted, That in every case where any person bound by recognizance for his or her appearance (or for whose appearance any other person shall be so bound) to prosecute or give evidence in any case of felony or misdemeanor, or to answer for any common assault, or to articles of the peace, shall therein make default, the officer of the court by whom the estreats are made out shall, and such officer is hereby required to prepare a list in writing, specifying the name of every person so making default, and the nature of the offence in respect of which every such person, or his or her surety, was so hound, together with the residence, trade, profession, or calling, of every such person and surety, and shall in such list distinguish the principals from the sureties, and shall state the cause, if known, why each such person has not appeared, and whether, by reason of the non-appearance of such person, the ends of justice have been defeated or delayed; and every such officer shall, and such officer is hereby required, before any such recognizances shall lie estreated, to lay such list, if at a court of oyer and terminer or gaol delivery in any county, before one of the justices of those courts respectively, and if at a court wherein a recorder or other corporate officer is the judge or one of the judges, before such recorder or other corporate officer, and if at a session of the peace, before the assistant barrister or two other justices of the peace who shall have attended such court, who are respectively authorized and required to examine such list, and to make such order touching the entreating or putting in process any such recognizance as shall appear to them respectively to be just; and it shall not be lawful for the officer of any court to estreat or put in process any such recognizance without the written order of the justice, recorder, corporate officer, assistant barrister, or justices of the peace, before whom respectively such list shall have been laid.

That the justices of peace in every shire, city, or town, or two of them at the least, whereof one to be of the quorum, have authority and power to let any such prisoners, or persons mainpernable by the law, that have been imprisoned within their several counties, city, or town, to bail or mainprise, unto their next general sessions, or unto the next gaol-delivery of the same gaols in every shire, city.

1 Ilf HERE in the Parliament holden at Westminster in the third year of the reign of the noble Prince King Henry the Seventh, it was among other things ordained and enacted, That no prisoner arrested for felony,

1 should be letten to bail or mainprise by any one justice of peace, but by the whole justices, or at least by two of them, whereof one to be of the quorum; since the making of which estatute, one justice of peace in the name of himself and one other of the justices his companion, not making

* the said justice party nor privy unto the case wherefore the prisoner should

* be bailed, hath oftentimes by sinister labour and means set at large the greatest and notablest offenders, such as be not replevisable by the laws

* of this realm; and yet the rather to hide their affections in that behalf,

have signed the cause of their apprehension to be but only for suspicion of

* felony, whereby the said offenders have escaped unpunished, and do daily,

to the high displeasure of Almighty God, the great peril of the King (and Queen’s true subjects, and encouragement of all thieves and evildoers. ’

II. For reformation whereof, be it ordained and enacted by the King and Queen’s Majesties, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the first day of April next coming, no justice or justices of peace shall let to bail or mainprise any such person or persons, which for any offence or offences by them or any of them committed, be declared not to be replevised or bailed, or be forbidden to be replevised or b&ilcd by the statute of Westminster primer, made in the Parliament holden in the third year of the reign of King Edward the First.

III. And furthermore. That any person or persons arrested for manslaughter or felony, or suspicion of manslaughter or felony, being bailable

Class XXV.—B.] Criminal Proceedings.—Examination, t$c.

by the law, shall not after the said first day of April be let to bail or mainprise by any justices of peace, if it be not in open sessions, except it be by two justices of peace at the least, whereof one to be of the quorum, and the same justices to be present together at the time of the said bailment or mainprise; which bailment or mainprise they shall certify in writing subscribed or signed with their own hands, at the next general gaol-delivery to be holdeft within the county where the said person or persons shall be arrested or suspected.

IV. And that the said justices, or one of them being of the quorum, when any such prisoner is brought before them for any manslaughter or felony, before any bailment or mainprise, shall take the(l) the examination of the said prisoner, and information of them that bring him, of the fact and circumstances thereof, and the same, or as much thereof as shall be ma^ tcrial to prove the felony, shall put in writing, before they make the same bailment; which said examination, together with the said bailment, the said justices shall eertify at the next general gaol-delivery to be holden within the limits of their commission.

V. And that every coroner, upon any inquision before him found, whereby any person or persons shall be indicted for murder or manslaughter, or as accessory or accessories to the same before the murder or manslaughter committed, shall put in writing the effect of the evidence given to the jury before him, being material: And as well the said justices as the said coroner, shall have authority by this Act to bind all such by recognizance or obligation (2), as do declare any thing material, to prove the said murder or manslaughter, offences or felonies, or to be accessory or accessories to the same as is aforesaid, to appear at the next general gaol-delivery to be holden within the county, city or town corporate, where the trial thereof

The coroner’s doty upon an inquisition found before him.

(1) In Rex e. Paine, 1 Salk. 281, the court ruled that the depositions taken in a case of misdemeanor could not be read, the witness being dead. The court said, that in case of felony such depositions might be used in evidence by this statute, bnt it could not be extended further. “ But there is nothing in this Act, or in the next number, (which extends the same provisions to cases where the prisoner is committed) which ordains, that if the deponent die his depositions maybe giveh in evidence on the trial. In 2 Hale, P. C. 52, it is said, The examinations, (viz. of the party accused) may be read in evidence against the prisoner, gnd so may the information of witnesses taken upon oath, if they are dead, or not able to travel, for they (the justices) arejadgesof record, and the statute enables and requires them to take th$ac examinations.’ The some position is in 1 Hale, 305. In 2 Hawk. ch. 46. § 6. it is said, that the examination of an informer, taken by virtue of these statutes, may be given in evidence at the trial of the inquisition or indictment, if it be made out by oath to the satisfaction of the court that such informer is dead, or unable to travel, or kept away by the means or procurement of the prisoner. Sir Mic. Foster, enumerating the instances wherein the law makes a difference between the cases of petit treason and murder, says that, 4 Upon the foot of 5 and 6 Ed. VI. informations taken before justices of peace are not evidence to ground a conviction for petit treason if the party be living, though unable to travel, or kept out of the way by the prisoner; ’ Cro. Law. 337; plainly intimating

his opinion of the admissibility of such evidence in cases of felony. In Webster's case, Leach’s Cro. Ca. 14. the information of an accomplice who died before trial, is said to have been adjudged by Ld. Ch. Justice Lee to be admissible. In Bromwich’s case, 1 Lev. 180. 2 Jon. 53. it was ruled that depositions before a coroner were evidence, if the witness was dead or beyond sea; but according to the report in Jou. it was said, that those taken before a justice of'peace ean in no case' be read. Vide 1 Kelynge, 55 Harrison's case, State Trials, 941. The weight of authorities hpou the point seems to he such, that it would be too late to resort to reasoning upon the construction of the Act, although (were such reasoning not excluded) the exposition which has been given to it may be very disputable. Vide 3 T. R. TOT, Rex v. Eiiswell.” Editor's note to Rex ik Pa ne, in the sixth edition of Salkeld.

(2) In 2 Hate, P. C. 282. it is said, that the justices who take the examination of witnesses may, before the trial, bind over the witnesses to appear at the sessions, and in case of their refusal to come, or to be bound over, may commit. In Barnet v. Wilson, 3 M. and . 1. it was held, that no action coaid be maintained for committing a feme covert, who did not find snrely to appear at the trial, and said “ eke would not go / and nobody should make her* The decision was founded upon the positive act of refusal; but, from some expressions of the court, it may be inferred to be the inclination of their opinion, that a magistrate may commit an infant or feme co-rerf, not finding sureties to appear to give

VI. Provided always, and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That justices of peace and coroners within the city of London and the county of Middlesex, and in other cities, boroughs and towqs corporate within this- realm and Wales, shall within their several jurisdictions have authority to let to bail felons and prisoners, in such manner and form as they have been heretofore accustomed; this Act or any thing therein contained to the contrary notwithstanding: And also shall take examinations and bonds, as is aforesaid upon every bailment by them or any of them to be made; and shall certify every such bailments, bonds and examinations by them or any of them taken or made, at the next gaol-delivery to be holden within the shire, city, borough or town, where their several jurisdictions extendeth, upon like pain and forfeiture as is before limited in this present Act.

Removing of a

evidence for felony. And in the argument of counsel for the defendant it is said to be the uniform practice, in case both of infants and married women, to require a recognizance of some third person, if they refuse to appear, and in case of refusal of such recognizance, to commit.

I have no doubt that there have been many instances of such commitment; but, from a long acquaintance with magisterial functions, I am satisfied that it is very far from being an uniform practice; and I think it would be extremely dangerous if the law appeared to be otherwise upon principle, to allow the number of instances which might be shewn to have taken place, of such commitments, to have any influence on the decision of the question, unless such instances had been expressly sanctioned by the authority of the superior courts, more especially when it is considered that those who, from their situation, would be unable to procure the requisite surety, would, in almost every instance, be equally unable to find the means of redress, either by action or by writ of habeas corpus. 1 very well remember having read an account of Lord Kenyon incidentally mentioning, that he had seen a calendar of prisoners which ’itained such a commitment, and express *

ing a decided opinion of its illegality. The commitment in case of wilful refusal seems to be a fair exertion of the implied authority given by the statute; but, that the inability of an infant or married woman to find collateral surety for appearing to testify the injury which they suite red, or the crimes of which they may be cognizant, should be a ground for immuring them in a prison from one assizes to another, is an injustice so flagrant' and palpable, that it ought not to be imputed to the law upon any less authority than the most express and unequivocal mandate of the legislature: and such commitments, to use the language of Sir Joseph Yates with respect to general warrants, (Money v. Leach, 1 Bl. Rep. 555.) ought to be held so totally bad, that an usage even from the foundation of Rome itself would not make them good.

(1) Quaere, If the magistrate can also compel a recognizance to prefer an indictment ? —I was once consulted upon this question, where the person in whose name a forgery had been committed was willing to be bound to give evidence, but refused to enter into the recognizance to prefer the indictment, and did not feci that I could safely advise the magistrate to commit.

WHERE at a Parliament holden at Watminttcr in the third year of King Edward the First, the same King moved the prelates of the realm, and them enjoined upon their faith that they owed to him, that in no wise they should deliver those clerks which were indicted for 1 felony, without due purgation, so that the said King should have no need to put other remedy in that behalf; and that notwithstanding that monition, divers and many clerks convict were accustomably delivered, and suffered to make their purgations, to the great courage of evildoers:

II. 4 By occasion whereof afterward, at another Parliament holden at Westminster in the fourth year of King Henry the Fourth, upon the complaint of the Commons, the same King Henry the Fourth then advertised the prelates of the realm of the premises, intending them, to have provideo remedy by authority of the said Parliament, ss appertained to his prerogative royal, for the conservation of the peace of the crown; atwhich time the archbishop of Canterbury, for himself and all other bishops of his province, then openly promised to the said King Henry the Fourth, 4 That if any person from thenceforth were convict of any treason which touched not the King nor his royal Majesty, and such as were notoriously known and reputed Tor thieves, and for such cause delivered to any ordinary as a clerk convict, that the ordinary, to whom such person or persons 1 were delivered, should safely keep them after the effect of a constitution provincial, to be made by the said archbishop and bishops after the effect

and that the mainprizes should be sealed with their seals, and returned into chancery within three weeks after life end of the said three months; 1 and that if they that should have such charters would in time to come aid themselves thereby, and should not find such mainprizes, or after such mainprize found, should bear themselves otherwise against the ' peace than they ought, their charters should be holden for none; which statute hath been found very inconvenient, in relation to divers persons 1 who have been esteemed lit objects of mercy; and therefore the said statute hath been seldom put in practice, hut for the most part hath been dispensed withal in the charters of pardons that were granted in former reigns: And forasmuch as by one Act, made in the first year of their now Majesties’ reign, intituled, An Act for declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and settling the Succession of the Crown, it was € enacted.

Be it therefore enacted by the King’s and Queen’s most excellent Majesties, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That the said Act, made in the tenth year of King Edward the Third, and every article and clause therein, shall be and are repealed and annulled, and are hereby declared to be repealed and annulled, to all intents and purposes whatsoever: Provided nevertheless, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any charter of pardon be pleaded by any person for any felony, the justices before whom such pardon shall be pleaded may, at their discretion, remand or commit such person to prison, there to remain until he or she shall enter into a recognizance, with two sufficient sureties for his or her being of the good behaviour for any time not exceeding seven years. Provided that if any such charter of pardon be pleaded by a feme covert or infant, such feme covert or infant may find two sufficient sureties who shall enter into a recognizance for him or her being of the good behaviour as is aforesaid.

* This is the last Act of general pardon. Such Acts, in some of the very earlier reigns, particularly those of Elizabeth and James the First, are very frequent—The exceptions in 20th Geo.

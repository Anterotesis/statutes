Order of Ser- 1 respecting the advancement of prices of all things belonging to the said vants. Labour- < servants and laliourers; the said laws cannot conveniently, without the on, &c. great grief and burden of the poor labourer and hired man, be put in

And a Dedara- good and due execution: Ana as the said several Acts and Statutes tion who shall were, at the time of the making of them, thought to be very good be compellable and beneficial for the commonwealth of this realm (as divers of them toserve in Han- < are): So if the substance of as many of the said laws as are meet to be dicrafts and who continued shall be digested and reduced into one sole law and statute, in.HJ“^ndl7» 1 and in the same and uniform order prescribed and limited concerning and their se- < t^e wages and other orders for apprentices servants and labourers, there wai Duties, «is good hope that it will come to pass that the same law (being duly

c* executed) should banish idleness, advance husbandry, and yield urito

the hired person both in the time of scarcity and in the time of plenty, 1 a convenient proportion of wages/

(1) This Statute, of which the greater part has long been obsolete in practice and inapplicable to the state of society, was probably deemed a masterpiece of wisdom and policy at the time of its being passed, when the general fashion was to submit all matters of private interest at much as possible to public regulation. The provision which precluded persons from exercising such occupations as their own convenience might suggest, without having served an apprenticeship, was allowed to continue its operation in the depression of talent and industry, and the encouragement of illegal combination, in opposition to tKe judgment of every enlightened inquirer, the lessons of experience, the discouragement of Courts of Justice, and the frequent interposition of the legislature, in creating particular exceptions, until the Session of Parliament immediately preceding the present publication, when the commerce oP-the country was fortunately relieved from its pressure.—See Statute 54 Geo. III. c. 9G.—A very able and judicious view of the real motives and purposes of the Act for the discouragement of commerce and ma-'nufacturea, on account of their supposed opposition to the interests of agriculture, is taken in a Tract recently published, and included in the 5th volume of a periodical publication, called the Pamphleteer.

The Provisions of this Act, and of the subsequent Statute of 1 Jame* I. for enabling and requiring justices of peace to regulate the rate ol wages, (manifestly, however iujudicknuly, intended to operate in favour of masters,) after continuing dormant for a long apace of time, were lately endeavoured to be brought into operation by combinations of workmen: an attempt which occasioned their repeal, by Stat. 53 Geo. III. c. 40. See Post Title Servants.

1 have thought it advisable, notwithstanding the repeals above noticed, to retain the whole of the Statute.

The Statute relates only to such persons who bind themselves as apprentices as are under age, and not to adults. Smedley v. Gooden, 3 M. & . 189.

XL. Provided always, That this Act or any thing therein contained or mentioned shall not lie prejudicial or hurtful to the cities of London and Norwich, or to the lawful liberties usages customs or privileges of the same cities, for or concerning the having or taking of any apprentice or apprentices; but that the citizens and freemen of the same cities shall ana may take have and retain apprentices there, in such manner and form as they might lawfully have done before the making of this statute; this Act or any thing therein contained to the contrary m any wise notwithstanding.

XLI. And be it also further enacted, That all indentures covenants promises and bargains of or for the having taking or keeping of any apprentice, otherwise hereafter to be made or taken than is by this statute limited ordained and appointed, shall be clearly void in the law to all intents and purposes; (13) and that every person that shall from hence(13) It is fully settled that these words shall not be construed to render the Indenture of Apprenticeship absolutely void, and that it is only voidable j although a different construction is put upon the tame words in Statutes 3 Ann, c. 9, 9 Ann, c. 21. imposing a duty on Premiums of Apprenticeship; as to which, see Jackson v. Warwick, 7 T. R. 121. The principle that Indentures not conformable to the Statute are only voidable, was first applied to Cases of Settlement; but in Rex. v. Evered, Cald. 26. cited 16 East. 2711, it was held that a person who, when an infant, had been bound an apprentice for six yeats, and, when of age, had run away, (alleging afterward! that he did so with intent to avoid the indentures) was subject to punishment. Aston I. said, “ Supposing the Indentures voidable, I cannot conceive that the Apprentice's running away could avoid them; had he served regularly, and during such service declared his intention to depart, it might have been different: here he would snake use of his offence in order to avoid the punishment that attends it; but it ia too late to do it before a Justice when charged with a crime." And this case was admitted as authority in Gray «. Cooksoo, 16 East. 13. In Rex v. Windingham, 6 T. R. 557, (a settlement case,) an infant, bound for less than seven years with his master's consent, entered into the King’s service; and this was held not to be such an avoidance of the Indenture as to enable him to acquire a settlement by service during the term. Lord Kenyon, after expressing his opinion that the Indenture had not been put an end to, added, a But 1 desire it may not betaken for granted, that an infant who binds himself apprentice, a contract to notoriously for his vwn benefit, may put an end to that contract at any time during hia minority. I enter my protest against discussing that question now; it will be sufficient to determine it when it necessarily rises." And in Ashcroft v. Berries, 6 T. R. 652, it was ruled, that sn action lies for harbouring an

apprentice bound for six yean, who left his master’s service after attaining the age of 21, and the Court said, that, supposing the Indentures to be void, which they were not prepared to deride, the mere act of quitting the master’s service was not an avoidance of them. See note to Section 43, infra.—It is very difficult to conceive how such strong words as those in the Statute respecting contracts being clearly void, could be reconciled to the doctrine, that such contracts were in any respect avoidable; or how the decisions in support of the validity of such contracts can be reconciled with numerous decisions respecting ocher subjects; or the same subject, as regulated by a different Act, in which similar words have received a construction according to their full and literal signification. Still less is the construction which has prevailed to be reconciled with the general scope and object of the Statute, in subjecting almost every occupation to minute, however injudicious, regulation. Neither can it be conceived, upon what legal principle words, which are so strong and positive in themselves, should not only be reduced in their construction below their natural and ordinary signification, but should bo held to be so absolutely nugatory and inefficient as to admit of no possible operation, even with respect to the most solemn and formal avoidance of an instrument, which the law has declared to be absolutely void.—As to the supposition of a contract of apprenticeship being so notoriously for the benefit of the infant, it is a supposition which, when taken generally and indiscriminately, is absolutely and notoriously false; as the actual benefit must depend upon t great many adventitious circumstances, with respect to the kind of occupation, the variations in the course of trade, the dull, the character, and the disposition, of the respective parties. But of all the difficulties incident to the subject, the greatest will be, to reconcile the de- rition in Ashcroft v. Berries, to that in the case ex parte Davies, mentioned in the following Note.

(14) This Clause seems sufficiently explicit with respect to the obligatory force of contracts of apprenticeship entered into by infants, conformably to the regulations of the Statute; but in the case ex parte Davies, 5 T. R. 715*. a woman, who had been bound for seven years, having attained the age of twenty-one, was discharged on Habeas Corpus; and Lord Kenyon said, M Every indenture of an infant is voidable at his election. But when the binding is under the authority of an Act of Parliament, that takes away the power of electing to vacate the indentures. But I know

of no Act which prohibits the party, in a case like

the present, to make such election upon her

coining of age. The Apprentice ought not to

have been brand longer than till she was twenty-one, and we ought now to discharge her."—In ex parte Gill., 7 East. 376. an apprentice having applied for a Habeas Corpus, after being committed under the authority of 20 G. II. c. 19, notwithstanding he objected that the indenture was not obligatory after he came of age, the Court held, that he must be remanded; and that, however the circumstances laid before the Court by affidavit might, if well founded, be matter of defence against the charge before the Magistrates, they could not be then examined by the Court; that if the defence had been made before the Magistrates, and they had disregarded it, the party had

a remedy against them; but that the Court had no authority to discharge the Apprentice from hie indentures:and that there was a mistake in that respect in the report of Davis’s case; the judgment of the Court there being, that M the Apprentice should be discharged out of the custody of her master, in whose custody she was when brought up before the Court." Upon revising these authorities, I cannot help thinking that it would have -been more accurate to have said, that Davis's case was hastily and improperly decided, than that it was erroneously reported; as there is no trace of any other custody than that controul which a master regularly has over his Apprentice; and the whole tenor of the judgment applies to the power of rescinding the contract, and not to any complaint of improper confinement and coercion. The power under Statute 43 Eli *, c. 2. (see the next Number of this Class) a£ binding poor apprentices, is with respect to women confined to 21, or marriage; but so far is there from being any thing in the Statute 5 Elis, with respect to Apprentices in general, to indicate such restriction, that by Section 25 it is provided, that the Apprentices there mentioned shall be bound until the age of 21 yean at the least, or 24 years, as the parties can agree; and by Section 26, the party is to be bound to the age of 24 yean at least.

(1) This provision extends to all labourers in general, as well as those in the particular occupations mentioned; and includes the case of a person sinking a well, to be paid by the piece. See Lowther v, the Earl of Radnor. 8 East. 113. Some objections having been made in consequence of provisions in subsequent Acts, appearing to interfere with this construction, Lora EUenborough said, “ The true answer seems to be, that at the time of pairing one Act the Legislature has not always had every other Act containing provisions bearing upon the same subject, brought under its consideration.

(2) Replevin cannot be maintained for goods distrained by virtue of a warrant from a Magistrate who has competent jurisdiction under the statute of labourers, (20 Geo. II. c. 19. s. 1.) to issue a warrant of distress and sale on refusal of the party to pay, nor can the question of a Magistrate’s jurisdiction be tried in such an action; and therefore it cannot be pleaded in bar to a recognisance made under such warrant, that the labourer did not duly make oath before the Magistrate that the sum claimed was due to him for wages, nor that such sum was not due. Wilson t?. Weller. 3 Moore, 294, s. c. Taunt. & Brod.57.

(3) The employer is the person on whose

service the employment is, and not the bailiff, though the contract of hiring may have been personally with the bailiff. R. v. Hoseason 14. East. 605.

(4) Under the Stat. 20 Geo. II. c. 19. s. 2. for regulating servants in husbandry artificers and other labourers there mentioned, if a justice of the peace, upon a complaint made to him of the misconduct of such persons in their employments, sentence the offender to be committed to the house of correction for a time not exceeding one calendar month, he must if he intend to proceed upon that statute also sentence him there to be corrected and held to hard labour; but the statute gives the justice an option to punish the offender in that manner or otherwise by abating part of his wages or by discharging him from his employment.

That where any poor children should be appointed to be bound apprentices pursuant to the said Act of Queen Elizabeth, the persons to whom they are so appointed to be bound apprentices shall receive and provide for them according to the indenture signed and confirmed by the two justices of the peace, and also execute the other part af the said indentures under the penalty in case of refusal of the forfeiture of ten pounds for every such offence, to be levied of the goods of the offender in the manner mentioned in the said Act u And whereas by 'an Act passed in the eighteenthyear of the reign of his present Majesty, intituled An Act to amend such Part of on Act made in the forty-third Year of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, intituled “ An Act for the Relirf of the Poor” as relates to the binding of Parish Apprentices, it was enacted, That when any man-child should be bound to be an apprentice by virtue of the said Act made in the forty-third year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, such child shall be bound to be an apprentice for no longer term than till he shall come to the age of twenty-one years: And whereas in such indentures of apprenticeship it hath been usual

on complaint of such apprentice, or of the churchwardens and Overseers of the poor of such parish or place, by warrant under their hands and seals to levy by distress and sale of the personal estate and effects or assets of such master or mistress respectively such sum or sums of money as shall be necessary for the maintenance and cloathing of such apprentice, and as shall also be necessary to reimburse to the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of such parish or place any sum or sums of money that shall have been reasonably expended by them for that purpose.

VII. And whereas it frequently happens that persons are compellable under and by virtue of the said Act of the ninth and tenth years of King William to take a greater number of parish apprentices than it is convenient for them to maintain or employ in their own families, and they are therefore forced to place out or assign over such apprentices to other persons; and it is proper that such assignment should be le- gaily made under the inspection and controul of the magistrates as

well for the benefit of the apprentice as that the original master may

be discharged from his covenants in respect of such apprentice; and it

is fit that the person to whom such assignment shall be made and also the apprentice should be made subject to the ordinary jurisdiction of justices of the peace with respect to masters and parish appaentices* Be it enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for any master or mistress of any such parish apprentice as aforesaid, by indorsement on the indenture of apprenticeship or by other instrument in writing, by and with the consent of two justices of the peace of the county city town riding division or place where such master or mistress shall dwell, testified by such justices under their hands, to assign such apprentice to any person who is willing to take such apprentice for the residue of the term mentioned in such indenture of apprenticeship: Provided always, That such person to whom such apprentice is intended to be assigned shall at the same time by indorsement on the counterpart of such indenture or by writing under his or her hand, stating the said indenture of apprenticeship and the indorsement and consent aforesaid, declare his or ner acceptance of such apprentice and acknowledge himself herself his or her executors and administrators to be bound by the agreements and covenants mentioned in the said indenture on the part of the master or mistress of such apprentice to*be done and performed; which indorsement or instrument may be in the forms or to the effect mentioned in the schedule hereunto annexed, marked with the letters D. and E.; and in such case such apprentice shall be deemed and taken to be the apprentice of such subsequent master or mistress to whom such assignment shall be made to all intents and purposes whatsoever, and so from time totime as often as it shall be necessary or convenient for any such subsequent master or mistress to part.with any such apprentice; and all justices of the peace shall have the like power and authority in the several cases last mentioned with respect as well to the subsequent master or mistress masters or mistresses as to the apprentice, as such justices shall then have by any law for the better regulation of parish apprentices.

VIII. And whereas no express provision has been made for the discharging of any such parish apprentice from a master or mistress who is become insolvent or is so far reduced in his or her circumstances as to be unable to employ or maintain such apprentice* Be it enacted. That it shall and may be lawful for two justices of the peace of the county city town riding division or place where any such master or mistress shall live, on the application of such master or mistress requesting that any such apprentice may be discharged fur the reasons aforesaid, to enquire into the matter of such allegations and to discharge any such apprentice from his apprenticeship in case the said two justices shall find such allegations to he true.

IX. Provided always and be it enacted, That nothing herein-before contained shall extend or be construed to extend to the indenture made on the binding of any apprentice by the churchwardens or overseers of the poor of any parish or place or the major part of them, under and by virtue of the powers given to them by the statute made in the forty-third

X. Provided also, and be it enacted, That no indorsement or indorse* ments on any parish indentures of apprenticeship here in-before mentioned made or executed in pursuance of this Act shall be charged or chargeable with any duty imposed upon stamped vellum parchment and paper, but the same shall be and are hereby declared to be exempted therefrom, and that no other instrument or instruments in writing hereinbefore mentioned shall be charged or chargeable with any higher duty than with the duty imposed or to be imposed on parish indentures of apprenticeship.

XI. And whereas by an Act passed in the twentieth year of the

reign of Ring George the Second, intituled, An Act for the better adjusting and more easy Recovery of the Wages of certain Servants, and ifpr the better Regulation of such Servants and of certain Apprentices, 1 it is enacted, That it shall and may be lawful to and for any two or

more justices upon any complaint or application by any apprentice

put out by the parish touching or concerning any misusage, refusal of

necessary provisions, cruelty or other ill treatment of or towards such apprentice by his or her master or mistress and due proof thereof, to discharge such apprentice from his or her apprenticeship: And whereas instances of such ill treatment frequently occur, and it is fit that the expectation of such discharge should not operate as an inducement to

such ill treatment:9 Be it enacted. That in every case where any parish apprentice whatsoever shall be discharged from his apprenticeship by two justices under and by virtue of the said last-mentioned Act, it shall and may be lawful for such two justices to order such master or mistress to deliver up to such apprentice his or her clothes and wearing apparel/ and also to pay to suen churchwardens or overseers of the poor of the parish or place to which such apprentice shall belong some or one of them a sum not exceeding ten pounds, to be applied by them some or one of them, under the order of such justices, for the again placing and binding out such apprentice so discharged as aforesaid or otherwise for his or her benefit as to such justices shall seem meet; and also to pay a sum not exceeding five pounds in case such master or mistress shall refuse to deliver up such clothes and wearing apparel; and in case such master or mistress shall refuse to pay the sum so ordered by the said justices to be paid as aforesaid or either of them or any part thereof, it shall and may be lawful for such two justices by warrant under their hands and seals to levy the same by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of such master or mistress together with the reasonable expences of £uch distress, and also, that it shall and may be lawful for such two justices if they shall so think fit to compel such churchwardens and overseers of the poor some or one of them to enter into a recognisance for the effectual prosecution by indictment of such master or mistress for such ill treatment of any such apprentice so discharged as aforesaid, and also to brder that the costs and expences of such prosecution shall be paid and discharged or reimbursed to such person or persons entering into such recognisance as aforesaid, one moiety thereof out of the poor rates of the parish or place to which such apprentice shall belong and the other moiety thereof out of the common stock of the county in which such parish or place shall lie; and in case the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of such parish or place for the time being shall refuse to pay such their moiety as aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful for such two justices by warrant under their hands and seals to levy the same by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of such churchwardens and overseers of the poor any or either of them together with the reasonable expences of such distress.

XIII. And whereas by the said last-mentioned Act it is also enacted, That it shall and may be lawful to and for two. justices upon applica* tion or complaint made upon oath by any master or mistress against any parish apprentice, touching or concerning any misdemeanor mis* carriage or ill behaviour of such apprentice to hear and determine the

same; and punish the offender in such manner as is therein mentioned,

II. Concerning bastards begotten and born out of lawful matrimony, (1.) fan offence against God’s law and man’s law! the said bastards being now left to be kept at the charges of the parish where they be born, to the great burden of the same parish, and in defrauding of the relief of the impotent and aged true poor of the same parish, and to the evil example and encouragement of lewd life: (2) It is ordained and enacted by the authority aforesaid, That two justices of the peace (whereof one to lie of the quorum) in or next unto the limits where the parish church is, (2.) within

(1.) The child of a woman divorced a mens et thoro is presumed to be a bastard: St. George’s and 9c. Margaret’s, Westminster, 1 Salk. 123. In other cases die legitimacy of a child bom of a married woman, although living separately from her husband, is presumed; but non-access may be graved: and the old notion that a child cannot be a bastard, if the parents were within the four seas, 5s completely exploded. The wife cannot be a witnem to prove the non-access; R. v. Reading, 2 seas. ca. 175: but where it was stated that it appeared on the examination of the mother, and on eiher proof, thet the husband had no access, the order was held good; as other proof must be intended legal proof: R. v. Bedali; And. 8. But it is very objectionable to support a judgment obtained upon evidence, some part of which is legal and other part objectionable; unless it can be distinctly ascertained that the same conclusion must have been come to if the objectionable evidence had not been given; and it is in most cases manifestly impomible to distinguish the particular impression made by any particular part of the evidence adduced in support of any given fret is detached and separate from the other evidence offered for the same purpose; and in the immediate question, the angle impression of the inad-musible evidence of the wife, if believed, would necemarily be more effective than that of all other witnewes (not going to remoteness of situation excluding the possibility of access) together. Where the husband, after an absence of some yean, returned a fortnight before the birth of the child, the order was held good, and per curiam—* Circumstances which shews natural impossibility that the

husband could be the father of the child of which the wife is delivered, whether arising from his being under the tge of puberty, or from his labouring under disability occasioned by natural infirmity, or from the length of time elapsed since his death, are grounds on which the illegitimacy of the child may be founded: that on the ground of improbability, however strong, they should net venture to proceed; but only such as shewed absolute physical imposribility: that the general presumption would prevail, except a case of plain, natural impossibility were shewn; and to establish as an exception the case of such extreme impossibility as the present could not do barm." R. v. Luffs, 8 East. 193.—The exception in the above case was certainly one upon the justness of which no doubt could be entertained: but it is to be recollected that the introduction of exceptions in extreme and favourable cases is often calculated to affect the certainty and stability of a rule; and it certainly would be very inconvenient to admit of particular inquiries as to the actual fact of filiation, when the question of physical impossibility may come to be a matter of critical nicety. If a man marries a woman whom he had never before seen, at however short a period previous to the birth, the legitimacy of the child is a settled point of law, notwithstanding the impossibility of the imputed filiation.

(2.) Quaere, Is this essential, or only directory: Vide R. v. Skinn, 1 Bott. 476. As to whether, there is any authority when the child is bom in an extra-parochial place: R. r. Baker, 1 Bott. 476.

which perish such bastard shall be born, (3.) upon examination of the No. I. cause and circumstance) (4.) shall and may by their discretion (5.) take jg vis. order (3.) as well for the punishment of the mother and reputed father of such bastard child, as also for the better relief of every such parish in part t c*, or in all; (3) and shall and may likewise by like discretion take order for *~m-r the keeping of every such bastard child, by charging such mother (7.) or A Pxovbion for reputed fattier with the payment of money weekly, or other sustentation the keeping of for the relief of such child, in such wise as they snail think meet and con- Bastaida venient: (8.)

(3.) There an several cases in which the settlement of bnaovds bin a different place from that of their birth'; and no provision has been made for say order of filiation in such cases, except in the case mentioned in Scat. 35 Geo. IL c. 101. s. 6. where die birth takas place during the suspension of an order of removal. Many orders have been made in these cases, hut it seems very clear that they cannot he supported; and the subject certainly requires the assistance of the legislature.

(4.) If the mother is dead, the examination before both, under Scat. 6. Geo. III. c. 31. is evidence of the fiCatioo; and the Court said that they bed no doubt that the sessions would be of opinion that it war conclusive: R. v. Raven-stone, ST. R. 373. And the same was ruled as to the ntmianhility of the evidence in Rex v. Clayton, 3 East. 58. But why a man should be concluded as to the truth of an ex parte examination taken in his absence, upon a subject upon which there is often a great deal of falsehood, it is nther difficult to discover. Neither is it very easy to reconcile the mere admissibility of the evidence with the decisions which have taken place respecting settlements; or with the general rale, that a party shall not be affected by evidence which he had no opportunity to controvert.

(5.) The aider mav he made after a period of fooiteen years: R. r. Miles, 1 sets. ca. 77.

(§•) Ine putative father must be summoned, unless he actually appears; but a summons by a third justice to appear before the justices making the order a sufficient: R. v, Taylor, Temp. Hard. 112. And if summoned it is not requisite that he should appear: R. v. Upton Gray, 1 Bott. 479. And it is not necessary that the summons or appearance should appear on the face of the order: B. s. Clayton, 3 E. 58.

(7.) An order may he made upon the mother, notwithstanding she is married before the order is made: Ellen Taylor's case, 3 Bur. 1681.

(8.) The order cannot direct security to be given for the performance thereof, but may be set aside as to that and confirmed as to the remainder: Rex v. Price, 6 T. R. 147. Rax v. Fox, cited ibid.

Bridges.

[No. I.] 22 Henry VIII. c. 5.—For Bridges and Highways.

BE it enacted by the King our Sovereign Lord, and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, That the justices of peace in every shire of this realm franchise city or borough, or four of them at the least, (1.) whereof one to be of the quorum, shall have power and authority to inquire hear and determine in the King's general sessions of peace of all manner of annoyances of bridges broken in the highways to the damage of the King's liege people, and to make such process and pains upon every presentment afore them for the reformation of the same, against such as owen to be charged for the making or amending of such bridges, as the King's justices ot his bench use commonly to do, or as it shall seem by their discretions to be necessary and convenient for the speedy amendment of such bridges.

II. And where in many parts of this realm it cannot be known and proved what hundred riding wapentake city borough town or parish nor 1 what person certain or body politick ought of right to make such bridges decayed, by reason whereof such decayed bridges for lack of knowledge of such as owen to make them for the most part lie long without any amendment to the great annoyance of the King's subjects

III. For the remedy thereof be it enacted by authority aforesaid, That in every such case the said bridges, if they be without city or town corporate, shall be made by the inhabitants (2.) of the shire or riding within the which the said bridge decayed shall happen to be; and if it be within any city or town corporate, then by the inhabitants of every such city or town corporate wherein such bridges shall happen to be; and if part of any such bridges so decayed happen to be in one shire riding city or town corporate, ana the other part thereof in another shire riding city or town corporate, or if part be within the limits of any city or town corporate and part without, or part within one riding and part within another; that then and in every such case the inhabitants of the shires ridings cities or towns corporate shall be charged and chargeable to amend make and repair such part and portion of such bridges so decayed as shall lie and be within the limits of the shire riding city or town corporate, wherein they be inhabited at the time of the same decays. (I.)

Jl.) If the Bridge be within a Franchise which i not four Justices and a Sessions of its own, the Justices of the County shall inquire; but if the Franchise be a County of itself, and hath not four Justices, it is not within the Statute, but is left to the remedy at Common Law: 2 Inst. 702.

(2.) In the reading upon this Statute, 2 Inst. 702. it is shewn that the term inhabitantt is re* fenible to the Occupiers of Tenements, and that Corporations are chargeable for the Roads in their own Occupation; but by Statute 12. G. II. c. 29. the charge of repairing Bridges is to be included in the general County Rate.

(3.) The Inhabitants of a County are bound to

repair every public Bridge within it; unless when indicted for the now repair of it they can shew by their plea that some other person is liable; and every Bridge in a highway is by the Stat. 22 H. 8. c. 5. deemed a public Bridge for this purpose. Therefore, where Queen Anne, in 1708, for her greater convenience, built a bridge on the Thames at Datchet, in the common highway leading from London and Windsor, in lieu of an ancient ferry which belonged to the Crown, and she and her successors maintained and repaired the Bridge till 1796, when, being in part broken down, the whole was removed, and the materials converted to the use of the King, by whom the ferry was

See convenient and sufficient for the repairing re-edifying and amendment of 21am such bridges; and after such taxation made the said justices shall cause Dou8« the names and sums of every particular person so by them taxed to be written in a roll indented: Ana shall also have power and authority to Two Colteettry make two collectors of every hundred for collection of all such sums of of every Hun-money by them set and taxed; which collectors receiving the one part of died, the said roll indented under the seals of the said justices shall have power and authority to collect and receive all the particular sums of money therein contained, and to distrain every such inhabitant as shall be taxed and refuse payment thereof in his lands goods and chattels, and to sell such distress, and of the sale thereof retain and perceive all the money taxed, and the residue (if the distress be better) to deliver to the owner thereof; and that the same justices or four of them within the limits of The Justices their commissions and authorities, shall also have power and authority to shall appoint name and appoint two surveyors, which shall see every such decayed Two who shall bridge repaired and amended from time to time as often as need shall repair the require, to whose hands the said collectors shall pay the said sums of money taxed and by them received; and that the collectors and surveyors and every of them and their executors and administrators and the The Collectors executors and administrators of them and every of them from time to and SurreyuriL time shall make a . true declaration and accempt to the justices of peaco shall accomj*; of the shire riding city or town corporate wherein they shall be appointed to the Jtimes* collectors or surveyors, or to four of the same justices, whereof one to be of the quorum, of the receipts payments and expences of the said sums of money:And if they or any of them refuse that to do, that then the same justices of peace or four of them from time to time by their discretions shall have power and authority to make process against the said collectors' and surveyors and every of them their executors and administrators and the executors and administrators of every of them by attachments under' their seals returnable at the general sessions of peace, and if they appear then to.compel them to account as is aforesaid; or else if they or any of them refuse that to do, ’then to commit such of them as shall refuse to ward,

the laws relating to rogues sturdy beggars and vagrants into one Act of Parliament, and for me more effectual punishing such rogues vaga *

bonds sturdy beggars and vagrants and sending them whither they ought to be sent, at is (amongst other things) enacted, That the justices of the peace at their quarter sessions may from time to time when need shall be, by such ways and means as monies for county gaols or bridges may be raised, cause such sums of money to be raised within their respective precincts and jurisdictions for the passing and conveying or maintaining of rogues and vagabonds as shall be necessary for those purposes: which said several rates when collected are to be paid by to- tue of the said several Acts into the hands of treasurers or receivers to be 4. appointed by the justices at their respective general or quarter sessions of the peace, and to beaccounted for as in and by the said several respective

Acts are recited: And whereas it is apparent that the manner and ms* 4 thods prescribed by the said several Acts for collecting some of the said rates are impracticable, the sums charged on each parish in the respective divisions being so small that they do not by an equal pound rate amount to more than a fractional part of a farthing in the pound on the several persons thereby rateable; and if possible to have been rated, the expence

of assessing and collecting the same would have amounted to more than the sum rated: And whereas many and great doubts difficulties and incon* veniences have arisen in making and collecting other of the said rates; 4 therefore that the good ends and purposes of the said several statutes may be answered and the several sums of money thereby intended re be raised may effectually be collected with as much ease and certainty and as little expence as can be to the parties obliged by the said laws to .pay the same / Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most excellent Mar jesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Loras Spiritual and Tern* poral and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the first day of September one thousand seven .hundred and thirty-nine the justices of the peace in that part of Great Britain called England, within the respective limits of their commissions at their general or quarter sessions, (1.) or the greater part of them then and there assembled, shall have full power and authority from time to time to make one general rate or assessment for such sum or sums of money as they in their discretions shall think sufficient to answer all and every the ends and purposes of the before-recited Acl& instead and in lieu of the several separate and distinct rates directed thereby to be made levied and collected; which rate shall be assessed

appeared that in cae iurinn only, in 1684* this put of the pariah had contributed to the Rah for the County at large, and that from 1768 to the present time. Rates in the nature of County Rata* had been asseawd upon the parish at large for the Borough Justices; for before the Charter of Eli *, this part of the parish could not have been contributory to the Borough Rates, and must have been by law contributing to the County Rates, and the Charter did not vary the place to which it should contribute from the County to the Borough; and though there was no poor rate, or petty constable, or other peace officer for <thia part of the paririi, out of which the rate might .he levied by Scat. 12 Geo. 2. c. 29. yet the Stature does not on that account transfer the right from the County to the Borough Justices, and the Geo.

In making the following Collection of the Statutes relating to this Title* I have availed myself of the assistance of Mr. Chitty vs Appendix to his Treatise on thn Game Laws, and on Fisheries; and have interlined all such Statutes connected with the Flan of the Work as relate to the subject, although they may not fall immediately within the object of this part of it, as relating to the Office of a Justice of Peace. Some of the more ancient Statutes may have become obsolete in practice, and inapplicable to the existing sate of the law; but as the space which they occupy is very incomiderable, 1 have thought it more eligible that they should be inserted. The Titles only are noticed of such as are of s local nature, and winch re* late to the Regulation of the Fishery as a Branch of Commerce; and no mention is made of those which relate to the Herring or Greenland Fisheries.

In a Conviction founded upon this Section, it must be distinctly stated in toe Information and in the Evidence that the proceeding was at the instance of the Owner of the Fishery; and, therefore, where it was merely stated in the memorandum of a Conviction that the proceeding was at the instance of such Owner, and where the Information, without containing any such allegation, concluded with a mere prayer of Judgment on behalf of such Owner, and the Evidence was wholly silent on the subject, the Conviction was held to be bad.

' ULWHEREAS an Act of Parliament passed in the thirty-first year of the reign of his present Majesty, intituled An Act for better protecting the several oyster fisheries within this Kingdom:* and

whereas the provisions of the said Act have been found inadequate to the protection of the oyster fisheries of this kingdom: and whereas doubts have arisen since the passing of the said Act whether the taking

oysters or byster brood from any oyster bed or laying or from any oyster fishery can under any circumstances be deemed felony and punishable as such: and it is therefore expedient and necessary that more effectual provision should be made for the protection of the oyster fisheries and for removing such doubts as. aforesaid: May it therefore

please your Majesty that it may be declared and enacted and be it declared and enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with rite advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That every person who shall at any time after the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and eight knowingly and wilfully steal take and cany away any oysters or oyster brood from any oyster bed or oyster laying or oyster fishery, being the property of any person or persons or body or bodies politick or corporate and sufficiently marked out as such, shall be deemed guilty of felony and shall and maybe transported for any term not exceeding seven years, or be imprisoned and kept to hard labour in any common gaol or house of correction or penitentiaiy house, or imprisoned only for any term not exceeding three years, as the court before whom any such person shall be convicted may adjudge.

II. Provided always and be it further enacted, That nothing in mis Act contained shall extend or be constnied to extend to subject or make liable any person or persons to the penalties of this Act who shall take or carry away any oyster or oyster brood from any oyster bed oyster laying or oyster fishery wherein such person or persons shall have or claim to have a right to take and carry away such oysters or oyster brood.

III. And whereas doubts may arise in what parish or county any oyster beds layings or fisheries are situated, and on that account diffi* culties may occur in bringing offender to justice* Be it therefore further enacted, That it shall be sufficient in any indictment under this Act, or under the said recited Act of the thirty-first year aforesaid, to describe either by name or otherwise the bed laying fishery in which the offence shall have been committed, without stating the same to be in any particular parish; and where the offence is committed on the border of any county so as to make it difficult to ascertain the county, such offence may be stated to have been committed in the county in which the indictment shall be preferred, being either the county in which the offence was committed or the adjoining county.

IV. And whereas it is doubtful whether justices of the peace for 1 towns corporate boroughs or other places and not being counties of themselves and having special or exclusive jurisdictions, can act by virtue of the statute of the thirty-first year aforesaid* Be it therefore enacted and declared, That it shall be lawful for such justices to act in all cases arising within their respective jurisdictions in like manner as any justice of ktne peace for any county riding or division may act for such county riding or division in the execution of the said Act or of any law for protecting foe oyster fisheries and broods of oysters.

V. And be it further enacted, That nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to repeal any of the provisions of the said Act of the thirty-first year aforesaid, except so far as the same respect the stealing and taking of oysters from any oyster bed laying or fishery *

CLASS XVII.

Forcible Entry.

It has been thought most convenient to introduce this Subject in the present Division, although some of the Statutes have not any immediate Relation to the -Functions of a Justice of Peace. For the general Exposition of the Law relating to itt see 1 Hawk. P. L. c. 64.—It is agreed, that an Indictment for a forcible Entry may be maintained at common Law; but an Indictment, stating that the Defendants, with Force and Arms, unlawfully broke and entered a Close, and unlawfully and unjustly expelled the Prosecutors, and kept them out of Possession, was held to be not sufficiently descriptive of the force requisite to constitute such Offence. It ought to amount to an actual Breach of the Peace; and this ought to appear on the dice of the Indictment. Rex r. Bake and others, 3 Bur. 1731.—It is stated by Hawkins, chat at common Law a Man disseised of Lands (if he could not prevail by fair means) might lawfully regain the Possession by force.—In Rex tv Wilson and others,

8 T. R. 357. the Indictment stated that the Defendant!, vi et armis, unlawfully, injuriously, and with a throng Hand, entered a Mill; and unlawfully, injuriously, and with a strong Hand, expelled A. B. &c. There were other Counts omitting the expression, with a strong Hand, which were abandoned as untenable. The Count containing those Words was held sufficient to denote the degree of force requisite to 1 support the Indictment: and, on a subsequent day. Lord Kenyon, referring to the Observations in Hawkins above cited, said, M Perhaps some doubt may hereafter arise rejecting that doctrine; but without giving any opinion concerning it, we may on the other: but leaving it to be proved or disproved whenever the question shall arise, all that we wish to say is, that' our opinion upon this case leaves that question untouched; it appearing that the Defendants unlawfully entered, and therefore the Court cannot intend that they had any Title/* It is manifest tint the word unlawfully* is very often thrown into Indictments as a wqrd of course; and, in general, the insertion of that ward will not supply the want of any essential averment requisite to constitute an Offence. In the particular case, the question whether the insertion of the word unlawfully was equivalent to an averment negativing a right of Entry was not argued at the Bar. A distinction is made with respect to an 1 Entry into a Dwelling-house, in which case the words, with a strong Hand, are not necessary. See Rex v. Bathurt, Sayer. 225; cited 3 Bur. 1699, 1702. See also the other cases cited in Rex v. Wilson.—There is a Form of an Indictment in Cra. Circ. Comp., which, according to the Cases, ia not sufficient, except in the instance of a Dwelling-house.

“ ITEM, Whereas by the noble King RrcBARD late King of England, “ A after the Conquest the Second, at his Parliament holden at wert-“ *minster the Morrow after All Souls, the fifteenth year of his reign, “ amongst other things it was ordained and established, That the statutes “ and ordinances made and not repealed of them that make entries with “ 'strong hand into lands or tenements or other possessions whatsoever “ and them hold with.force, and of them that make insurrections riots “ routs ridings and assemblies in disturbance of the peace or of the com* “ > mon law or in affray of the people should be holden and fully executed: “ And moreover it is ordained by the same statute. That at all times “ that such forcible entries be made and complaint thereof come to the “ justices of peace or any of them, that the same justices or justice shall “ take the power of the county and shall go or one of them shall go to “. the place where such force is made; ana if they find or he findeth any “ holding such place forcibly after such entry made, they should be taken “ and put in the next gaol, there to remain convict by the record of the “ same justices or justice until they have made fine and ransom to the King; and that all the people of the county as well sheriffs as other shall be attending to the said justices, and to assist them to arrest such “ malefactors upon pain of imprisonment, and to make fine and ransom “ to the King. And that in the same manner be done of them that make “ forcible entries into benefices or offices of holy church, as in the same “ statute is contained more at large.

Great Yarmouth, 8T.H 68. that that Enactment extends to the case of a Woman reriding under a Certificate, and not merely to the general Provisions of the Statute 35th Geo. III. against removing persons not actually chargeable: it seems to be, at least, very doubtful whether this or any of the other Sections of the present Act relating to Removals can be considered as in force: for if not actually chargeable, the party cannot now be removed; if actually chargeable, this Act contains no authority to prevent the removal* And as there is no provision for making any order

of Maintenance of Children bom under the circumstances in question, supposing the place of Settlement to be different from that of the Birth, it would, perhaps, be expedient either to repeal these Clauses, or to declare by express Enactment that the Acts shall be considered as in force, and to provide for the Filiation of the Child, as if bora in the place where the Settlement is.

I have, in the comae of magisterial duty, acted accordingly; although very for from confident of the correctness of the judgment which I have formed. Erf.

(3.) h is fuUy eettled that a general Averment of the Deftpdant not being qualified is sufficient In an Action on this Statute. Bluet r. Needs, Com. Hep. 522; and that such general Allegation is not sufficient in a Conviction; but that the several Quafifications enumerated in *22 and S3 Charles II. c. 25. must be negattvtiy set out in the Cooviction. It v. lands, 1 Bur. 148. And in Rex v. Earnshaw, 15 E. 456. the Conviction was set aside for not wpwdly negativing that the Defendant vn seised in right of his Wife; wkheogh the Conviction was according to the form of Bum, drawn by toed Ashburton, and which had been usually pursued. In Rex v. Crogr-ther, 1 T. R. 125. the Court seemed to think that it was not necessary that jthe Evidence should negative every pertindar Qualificationbut foe Conviction was quashed on aiMSker pomt; and the geneidl question, whether upon a Conviction k was necessary to give any Evidence of want of Qnafificatioa, waa not entesed into. Such EvU deuce is admitted not robe necessary in foe ease of an Action. In R. r. Stone, I Rash 436. tile Qnssrion, whether Evidence musthc given of the want -of Qiffikifea m case of a Conviction, osmadheeffy‘before the Court of King's Bench, ufesnfoe Judges wera equafly divided; Lord Kenyan stud Grose J. being of opinion that some Evi-denoe upon that point must be given; Lawrence J. and Le Blanc J. on die contrary, that the proof of QeeMficatianisy on the Defendant.

foe subject, and referring to the precedent in Burn, in which the Qualifications are negatived by foe Evidence, judiciously observes, mat fop considerations which he had stated may suggest foe prudence at least of adhering to a form so long used, till a conclusive determination shall, have set the Question at real. Lord Kenyon, in giving his Opinion in R. r. Stone, observed, “ It is said to he impossible for foe hosecotor’i Wit-steams to give negative Evidence of the want jqS Qualification; , but I do not see why it may nqt be done. A Witness may give general Evidence of k from his belief: he may know the Defend-anr, and know that to all appearance he may not he a man of substance. Evidence may be givsp of his condition jniife, to raise a reasonable presumption against his having any of the necessary Qualifications/* It is aho necessary to advert to his Lordship’s observation upon another part of the Section, in R. v. Davis, oT. R. 177.Herp was evidence tending to prove foe offence: wp have no authority to examine further, and sep whether foe cooeforion drawn by the Magistrate he or be not the inevitable conclusion from fop Evidence, k is sufficient in Convictions if fherp ware such Evidence before the Magistrate, as, ip an Action, would be sufficient to be left to Jury/ *

(4.) The mere keeping a Lurcher is sufficta* to incur the Penalty, without using. R. v. FHer| 1 Set. 426. So of narepipe* and such like, which are peculiarly fitted or disposed for killing Game: per Curistn, R*x'v. Suteer, Andr; 255. Str. 1098.; but it is otherwise with respect to a

which !* not an i

t to appropriated to kilting Gum, aa that it i* criminal for a penoo to have one in his custody only s Ruled ibid. In Rex «. Huntley, Cald. 176. it seems to have been thought that the mere keeping a Greyhound was sufficient; but in Read v. Phelps, 15 East. 271. in an Action for keeping a Setting-dog, there being no Evidence of the Dog, which was still young, having been used for the purpose of killing Gome, it was ruled that the Action could not be supported; and Lord EUenborough arid, that according to the argument of the Plaintiff1, the keeping of a dog, not. for the purpose of destroying Game, would be Evidence of a keeping in order to destroy k.

(5.) In Rex e. King, 1 Seas. Css. 88. Parker Ch. J. said that walking about with a Gun, with Intent to kill game, is Evidence of using the instrument for that purpose. In Rex v. Davis, 6 T. R. 177. the Witness swore that the Defendant did keep and use a Gun with intent to kill and destroy Game, and that he was satisfied that he did so, from hearing a Gun go off, and observing that it was fired by the Defendant, who was walking about with that apparent intent; and the Conviction upon this Evidence was held good: Vi. the Observation of Lord Kenyon, supra note 3. In Rex «. Thomson, 2 T. R. 18; a Deposition by the Witness in general terms, according to the Precedent in Burn, that the Defendant did keep and use a Gun to kill and destroy the Came, was supported as being an established Form, although objectionable upon principle; and the Decision was adhered to in Rex r. Pearse, 9 East. S58. In Rex v. Clarke, 8 T. R. 220. the Court expressed their approbation of the manner in which the Conviction waa drawn up, wherein the Magistrates had not simply stated in the words of the Act of Parliament, that the Defendant had kept and used, &c. but had set forth the particular Evidence of his having done so; vis. that the .Witness had seen him course and kill s Hare with

the said Greyhound; and had also set forth all the Evidence for and against.the Defendant, upon the Question of his Qualification: and they recommended this as a precedent to be followed in future. See the precedent foamed on the same principle. Bum Game L. and said to be drawn by Lord Ashburton; but see also Rex v. Earnshaw, supra, note 3.

Jff.) A Conviction for keeping and using a Dog fd a Greyhound, was held good; and Lord Mansfield said that he thought a D>og called a Greyhound was positive enough, and must mean the Dqg of that species generally known in this country. Rex tr. Hartley, Caldw. 175. In Rex «. Earnshaw, a Conviction for keeping and using a Dog called a Lurcher was held to be sufficient.

(7.) The Act only extends to such Dogs as are erticulariy mentioned, therefore in Hooker v, Willa, 2 otr. 112ti. it was held that an Action Could not be maintained for the Penalty for using Hound to destroy the Game. So in Reason v. Little, Com. Rep. 576. where the Action was for uringaDof.

(8.) In Rex r. Newman, Loft, 178. upon \ application for an Intonation against a Jusd for convicting two unqualified persons who won out coursing with a qualified person, the Conn were of opinion, that the two unqualified persons were protected by being in company with the qualified one; but dismissed the application, the Justice paying costs. The subjecting the Justice to costs seems to have been rather a hard measure, whatever may have been the Law upon the principal question; as there seems to hsve been no ground for imputing any thing more than a mere erroneous judgment, which would not hive been sufficient without more to have supported the Information if it had been brought to trial. In a case before Lawrence J. at Stafford, cited in the later Editions of Bum, it was held that though a qualified person may take his Servant to assist him to kill Game, he cannot qualify him to kill it, neither will his presence protect an unqualified person, not being his Servant, who goes to take the amusement of coursing. But if such person take an active part by beating across tho fields, or on open lands, and join in the diversion in the same manner with a qualified perron, he is as much liable to the Penalties at if no qualified person was present; but from a note in 15 East. 462. it appears that there is reason to think that that case was governed by special circumstances. In Rex v. Taylor, 15 East. 460. It was held that a Huntsman attending bis Master was not liable to the Penalties. The genera!

question came more fully before the Court in Lewis r. Taylor, 16 East. 49. where the Defendr ant was out coursing with a qualified man, and took an active part in the sport by beating tho Bushes, and took up the Game after it had been killed; and it was ruled that he was not liable to the Penalty of the Statute. Lord EUenborough said, u There it no Evidence against this Defendant of using a Greyhound for killing the Game. This is not a solitary amusement, and there is nothing to prevent a qualified person from taking others to assist him in the pursuit of tho Game, and he is the perron using the Dogs; the others have no other use of them than as his Serr vants, and contemplating with him the pleasures of the chase. If indeed, an unqualified man had used his own Greyhounds for the purpose of sporting, though in the same company with a qualified person, that case would admit of a dif* ferent consideration. The picking up of the Haro after it is killed, is no using of the Dogs to kiU Game." The other Judges agreed; and Bailey J* said, u The Defendant neither kept the Dog nos was it under his controul at the time it was used to kiU the Hare." The Legislature seem to.have had in view the variation of the judicial opinions above noticed. For by the Schedule of Assessed Taxes, 52 Geo. III. c. 93. a Duty is imposed upon any person who shall use any Dog, ftc. or shall take or kill or assist in any manner in the taking or killing any Game: which enactment, by 54 Geo. III. c. 141. is repealed as to persons

71ie Declaration in an Action on thb Clause usually avers, that the Defendant used a Gun, Ac. c. being an engine for the destruction of Game, to kill and destroy the Game: but in Avery v.

(13.) An Action of Trenus was maintained against a Justice, for committing a person who tad Effects which might have been distrained, bndbttly upon Conviction, without endeavouring to levy the Penalty on hit Goods. Hill v. Bateman, 2 Sir. 710.

(14.) A Magistrate who convicts an unqualified person of killing Game under the Stmt. 5 Ann, c. 14. and causes bb Dog to be brought for the purpose of sebing it, may older the Dog to be killed without any formal adjudication of Seizure. Kings-worthe. Bratton, 5 Taunt. 416..C. 1 Marsh, 196.

(15.) A Justice of Peace may take a Gun uaed by an unqualified person, Devensh. c. Mcrtoag 7 Mod. 215., but not the Gun oft Gamckecpeft although he be not within hu own Manor.' Rogers v. Carter, 2 Wils. 286. he cannot enter d a house to search for Engines, Ac. c. See Briggs a Evelyn, 2 H. B. 114.

(16.) The Courts will not permit the Tide at Boundaries of a Manor to be tried in an Action for Penalties on the Game Laws, provided them b any colourable Title; but it b otherwise when there b no pretence of Title, and them has been no other Exercise of Right than the granting of the particular Deputation. Celcraft v. Gibbs, 4 T. R. 681. and Hawkins v. Bailey, and Shut v. Grimes, them cited. And upon uie new Trial in Calcraft and Gibbs, 5 T. R. 19. it appeared that the person making the appointment tad purchased an Estate within the Manor from th§ Lord, who agreed that he should have the Deputation of the Manor: thb was held noC to be such a colour of Title as would excuse the Gamekeeper. Lord Kenyon said, “A man cannot convey to another the power of appointing a Game-keeper, without a conveyance abo of the Manor itsefe Such a power b a mem emanation of the Manor, and b inseparable foom it. It b a mem shadow, accompanying the substance.

(17.) 8emble, that a Lord of a Manor, although not qualified by Estate, may kill Game within hb Manor, but not elsewhere. See Maflock n--Eastley, 7 Mod. 482; and Goats referred top Chttty, 42.

In all such gaols, the male and female prisoners shall be confined in separate wards or parts of the gaol.

SCHEDULES to which this Act refers.

SCHEDULE (A.)

Instructions to be prefixed to the Provision Book of every Gaol.

The grand jury of each county will determine from three descriptions of dietary, detailed in the provision book, which may be most suitable to the circumstances of the county; and such dietary is to be posted up in some conspicuous part of the prison, and used throughout the gaol. The columns under the head of the two other dietary tables will of course remain blank.

A pass book is to be kept with the contractors for each article of provision consumed in the gaol, in which the amount of quantity of each article is to be entered as it is supplied. When a payment is to be made, the provision book and pass books are to be made up, to ascertain that the quantity used of each article, together with the quantity in store, corresponds with the quantity laid in, and with the regulated allowances. The blank columns at the end of the account are intended for any extra supplies, as where turf is used as fuel, or under any other extra circumstances.

When any man is placed on diet below the regulated one, his allowance of each article composing the usual diet will make a deduction in the column in which the amount of that article is stated; this deduction from the regular calculation will be explained by a N.

\ 'WHEREAS the common highways in this kingdom are to be main* t tained and kept in repair (except in certain cases) by the inhabitants of the several parishes in which such common highways are situated; but it frequently happens that the boundaries of such parishes

pass through the middle of such common highways, and one side of such highways is situated in one parish and the other side of such high* ways is situated in another parish, whereby great inconveniences have

often arisen to such parishes in settling the time and manner of repairing

and amending the same, and great detriment has arisen thereby to the public from the want of the due repair of such highways:’For remedy thereof, be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful for any two justices of the peace for any county riding or division upon complaint or application to them by any surveyor or any one of the surveyors of the highways of any parish (stating to such justices in writing and by a plan thereunto annexed that there is situated in the said parish and also in some other parish adjoining thereto specifying the same, a certain common highway particularly describing the same'by metes bounds and admeasurement thereof, one side of which common highway ought to be made or repaired by one of such parishes and the other side thereof by the other of such parishes,) to issue their summons with a copy of such writing and plan thereunto annexed to the surveyor or one of the surveyors of the highways of such other parish, to appear before them on a day to be mentioned in such summons, not more than fourteen days nor less than seven days from the day of the date of such summons; and that in case the parties shall then appear before such justices they may then proceed finally to decide the matter in the manner herein-after mentioned in case all the parties shall consent thereto; but in case the surveyor summoued shall not appear on such first summons, or appearing shall require further time, the said justices shall adjourn the further consideration of the matter for any further time not more than twenty-one days nor less than fourteen days from the day of such adjournment, of which the surveyor not appearing shall have notice s on which day the said justices shall proceed to hear the parties and their witnesses, and whether the party summoned does or does not appear shall proceed to examine and finally determine the matter in form following: (that is to say,) That it shall and may be lawful for such justices and they are hereby required to divide the whole of such common highway by a transverse line crossing such highway into two equal parts or into two such unequal parts and proportions as in consideration of the soil, waters, floods, the inequality of such highway, or any other circumstances attending the same, they in their discretion shall think hist and right; and to declare adjudge and order that the whole of such highway oti both sides thereof in one of such parts shall be maintained and repaired by one of such parishes, and that the whole of such highway on both sides thereof in the other of such parts shall be maintained and repaired by the other of such parishes; and shall cause such their order and a plan of such highway and the allotment thereof as before mentioned to be fairly delineated on paper or parchment and filed with the clerk of the peace of the county in which such highway shall happen to lie, and shall also cause such posts stones or other boundaries to be placed and set up in such highway as in their judgment shall be necessary for ascertaining the division and allotment aforesaid.

TO THIS THIRD EDITION.

The last Edition of this Work collected the Statutes to the close of the 3rd of George the Fourth. Since that period, numerous and important additions and alterations have been made in all the great leading divisions of the civil and criminal Law. In some of these divisions the whole of the former Statutes have been absolutely repealed, and partially re-enacted; in others, former Statutory enactments have been consolidated into one Act; and almost every class has been altered, varied, or regulated, by new enactments. Some estimate may be formed of their extent and importance by a reference to the Chronological Table, from which it will appear, that the whole of upwards of two hundred additional Statutes have been incorporated in the present publication, and a great many others, of less general importance, referred to or abstracted. The object of the Editors of the present Edition having been to present to the Public every important public Statute, down to the close of the last Session of Parliament.

In order to point out the course and progress of the Statutes, as applicable to many branches of the Law, it has been thought proper to retain either the titles or abstracts, and in some cases, the whole of many of the repealed Statutes. This was rendered the more necessary, inasmuch as many reported decisions in the Law Courts were founded on these repealed Statutes, and

which, in many cases, are applicable to the new enactments. The Statutes repealed since the last Edition, are added immediately after the Chronological Table.

The Index to the present Edition has been considerably enlarged, and it is apprehended there will be no difficulty in referring to any particular subject in the whole of this extensive collection.

TO THE SECOND EDITION.

The very Imperfect manner in which those employed to print and collate the First Edition of this Work, performed their office, imposed upon the Editor the laborious task of collating the whole with the original Statutes. This duty, he trusts, will be found to have been discharged with fidelity; and that accuracy now impressed which alone was wanting to this most able and useful Publication.

The Editor has continued the Statutes, and the cases decided upon their direct construction, down to the present time. And has supplied some omissions in the original Collection.

It was his intention to have added a ninth and tenth volume, comprising a Treatise on the Statute Law (including the Practice of both Houses of Parliament) and a General Index of the Statutes themselves. But the Publishers have deemed it expedient to publish this addition by itself. From the progress already made, its appearance will not be long postponed.

PREFACE

TO THE

FIRST EDITION.

IN this collection it is endeavoured to bring together, in a moderate compass, the several Statutes which are connected with the ordinary course of Professional and Magisterial practice, accompanied by a very few others which appeared to possess an interest os matter of historical curiosity.

---

In order to accomplish this purpose, it was necessary to exclude all Statutes relating to the functions of the different Officers of Government—to matters of Revenue—to Naval and Military subjects, and other objects of partial and limited interest.

The Statutes relating to elections of Members of Parliament might have been included consistently with the general plan of the work, but as they are already contained in different publications appropriated to the particular subject, it was thought, upon the whole, more eligible to include those only which may be regarded as forming a branch of Criminal Law.

The Land Revenue of the Crown has been admitted as an exception from the general subject of revenue, so far as it is connected with the private titles of individuals, but not a$ it merely forms a matter of official regulation.

The Statutes relating to the Clergy—those concerning Ship-Owners, with some of the leading acts of Navigation, and some of the Statutes relating to Servants in the more extensive branches of Manufactures, as falling under the

vi PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

cognizance of a Justice of Peace, were thought to be of sufficiently general interest to require their admission. Those relating to any other trades and occupations may hereafter be added, if it should be found expedient; but as for as I can at present judge, the expense of such an addition would be much more considerable than its utility. Particular collections applicable to separate departments of business maybe very desirable.

I have been prevented by the unexpected magnitude of the work from adding a few Miscellaneous Statutes not foiling within its general scope and design, such as those relating to the Union with Scotland and Ireland, the alteration of the Style, the offices of Sheriff and Coroner, the Redemption of the Land Tax, and some others.

In forming a collection of this kind, it is difficult to fix ' the precise limits between the Acts which it would be desirable to admit, and those which it is proper to exclude; and the decision must necessarily involve a certain degree of arbitrary discretion, upon which no two judgments would exactly coincide; but upon the great majority of cases there will, probably, not be any material difference of opinion; and I hope it will not be found, upon a review of the Tables of Contents, that many acts of general practical utility have been omitted, or that the bulk of the work has been much increased by those which could have been conveniently dispensed with.

In general the Acts are inserted without abridgment, as they appear in the ordinary collections of the Statutes, as I felt it important to prevent the' misconception of the work being regarded as an abridgment.—In any future edition it may, perhaps, be found eligible to make some retrenchments with regard to common expressions of style, the recital of former acts of parliament, and certain enactments of frequent and general occurrence, but I am inclined to think, that the saving of expense which can be effected by such a retrenchment, will not be very considerable.

3* Several of these Statutes are given la tins Second Edition.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION vii

Where some parte oaly of a Statute are applicable to tbq general design of the work, the others, relating to temporaiy or limited objects, are omitted, or only noticed by inserting the marginal abstract. In some cases the Titles only are in* serted, as sufficiently declaring the olyect of the Act, as in eases of Acte by which others are continued or made pop petuai, or where the mention of such Acte may be considered as merely pointing out, in a general manner, the course and progress of the law, upon subjects in respect of which it would be foreign from the principal design of the work to include the entire contents. The mere Titles of some Acts of Parliament would give a very erroneous or inadequate notion, of their contents, but, generally speaking, I think they may hq considered as sufficiently apposite.

The same difficulties which have been adverted to as afiecftr ing the selection of the contents, are, in a certain degree, applicable to their arrangement.*—In the general distribution of the work I have followed, as nearly as my judgment would ndmit, the ordinary plan of a course of jurisprudence j but mt the subjects classed in Blaokstone’s Commentaries, and other systems of law, under the general title of Rights of Things are so very different in their nature and character as referable to the law of real property, and as referable to personal pro* petty and contracts, I have thought it preferable to consider them as separate divisions of the law.—The law of bankruptcy, which, in the Commentaries, is classed as one of the modes of acquiring personal property, has been thought more properly connected with the law of civil proceedings.—The Statute? respecting the office of a justice of peace as distinguished from* the general system of criminal laws, are arranged alpha* hetically as they occur in Burn’s Justice.—Several Statute? might, so far as respects the nature of their subject^ be placed in one or other of different classes without any material ground of preference.—The general course which has been adopted with regard to these has been, to insert them in the eartieg part of the work to which they have a sufficient relation: oil this account the Statutes respecting gaming, usury, stock-jobbing, and the sale of offices, are inserted in part HI. ap affecting the validity of the contract, rather than in part V, as

forming a 'branch of criminal lav.—For the same reason, the Statute of Frauds, and the Act For Amendment of the, which contain a greater variety of miscellaneous subjects undei* a common title, thau any others in the collection, are included fn the class of miscellaneous Statutes concerning real estates. Where any motive of convenience has appeared to require it, the title of the Statute is mentioned in each of the several classes to which it has relation, with proper references to the place of its insertion.—And in some few instances, particular clauses of an act are inserted in the class to which they relate, the act at large being inserted elsewhere.—Where provisions applicable to several distinct and independent subjects included in the same act are sufficiently designated by the title (which principally occurs in the Statutes of George the Second, and, in some instances, with a very ludicrons combination of subjects), they have been considered as if they were completely separate acts, and are arranged accordingly, so far as the respective subjects fall within the general plan of the collection.—The several classes being placed in the more general divisions of the work according to the nature and character of their principal contents, the particular act3 are assigned to their respective classes, although they may not be referable to the same general division—On this account the Statutes respecting Wales are placed in the part of the work appropriated to civil proceedings, although some of the particular numbers are foreign to that department of the law.—The Statutes respecting juries are included in the same part, although some of them relate solely to criminal law.—The Statutes respecting game and Ash are all included in the sixth part as relating to the authority of justices of peace, although some of them, as the late acts respecting deer-stealing and oyster fisheries, are not immediately the object of such authority, and there are a few other instances of a similar nature.— In some respects a chronological arrangement might be more convenient than one depending upon the order of subjects, hut upon Aill consideration, the balance appeared to be very much in favour of the latter, and wherever the object is to find a particular act, of which the year and chapter are previously known, it will be only necessary to refer to the chronological table.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

To several of the Statutes notes are added of the eases which have been decided upon their construction. In some instances, the notes are applied immediately to the particular expressions upon the construction of which questions have taken place.—In others they assume the character of a dissertation or a digest of the law, as applicable to the general subject.—In the composition of these notes, asmuch attention has been paid to conciseness as appeared consistent with perspicuity.—In the examination of some questions, I have interposed my own views, and canvassed with freedom, but I hope without transgressing the limits of respect, the conclusions of judicial authority. In others, I have ventured to suggest an alteration of the subsisting law, or to offer such opinions as have occured to me, with regard to matters of legislative en-quixy, which have already engaged the public attention, and conceiving that a disinclination to deviate from existing institutions, although proceeding from a laudable principle, has been carried to an inconvenient excess, I have, upon several occasions, adverted to that topic, and in so doing have not been solicitous to avoid a repetition of the same sentiments, or even the recurrence of similar expressions. In one of the numbers of the Appendix, referred to as a note to the act for the amendment of the law, I have entered more at large into the discussion of this very important and interesting subject, and endeavoured to illustrate the principles which may be usefully applied in the adherence to, or deviation from the existing systems; to counteract the tendency of an excessive dread of innovation, in impeding the course of real and substantial improvement; and to call the attention of those invested with legislative authority to the direct and adequate examination of measures proposed for their adoption, as depending upon their intrinsic merits, divested of the influence of certain favourite expressions which have been too frequently admitted as a substitute for more substantial arguments.

The notes on the Statutes of Limitations, and Set off, and on penal obligations, have been already published in the Appendix to a translation of Pothier’s Treatise on Obligations.— The article on Illegal Contracts in the Appendix is also ex(^.

traded from the same work, and is referred to ia some of the notes to the Statutes concerning Personal Property and'Contracts, as connected with the selects to which those Statutes immediately relate.—To the Statutes relating to Bankrupts, I have subjoined a letter to Sir Samuel Roailly on the revision of the Bankrupt Law, published in 1810, with the addition of some practical notes.—A few others of the notes are taken from the sixth edition of Salkcld’s Reports, published in the year 1796.

I have also taken the opportunity of including in the Appendix, some papers respecting the proposal of establishing a tribunal for the purpose of restoring the ancient distinction between superior and inferior courts.—These consist of the draft of an Act prepared by myself many years ago, and of which copies have been, at various times, submitted to the attention of several persons in authority; -*the copy of a Bill introduced by Lord Redesdale into the House of Lords in 1810 }—and a letter to that noble Lord upon the difference in the objects and regulations of the respective plans.—-This article may be, in some degree, regarded as an appendage to the provisions in the Statute of Gloucester, prohibiting suits for goods in the King’s courts under 40c. and is referred to in the note to that Statute accordingly.—The importance of the subject is veiy considerable, and if it should ever engage the attention of the legislature, 1 flatter myself with the hope, that the enquiries respecting it may be assisted by a perusal of the pieces now submitted to their attention.

The plan of this work had been completely framed, and a very considerable progress made in the execution, before the appearance of Mr. Gabbett’s publication, entitled “ A Digested Abridgement and Comparative View of the Statute Law of England and Ireland.”—The design and character of the respective publications are, m some respects, similar, but in others there is a material difference.—Independently of the particular distinction of Mr. Gabbett’s Digest, as including the Irish Statutes, it contains a more extensive range of subjects, which are classed under the precise titles of the chapters in Black stone’s Commentaries. The enactments are extracted

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. xi

from the several Statutes as referable to that order, without bringing the whole contents of each particular Act together, as they appear in the Statute Book, which (subject to the exceptions that have been noticed) is the general course adopted in this collection. The notes, which are a material part of the present work, are not included in the plan of the other.— Since Mr. Gabbett’s Digest appeared, I have frequently availed myself of its assistance, and have every reason to bear testimony in favour of the skill and accuracy which are manifested in its execution. Some references have been made in the notes of this work to the information derived from Mr. Gabbett, with respect to the enactments of the Irish Parliament upon similar subjects, and these references would have been much more general and frequent if I could have commanded a greater leisure from other avocations.

Such are the nature and objects of the work which is now submitted to the candour of the public.—Having devoted to it a considerable portion of time and attention, I cannot but feel an anxious wish for its favourable reception.—The utility of the design has been very generally acknowledged: frequent enquiries have beeu made respecting its progress by respectable individuals with whom I have no personal acquaintance or connection, and allusions have been made to it in the course of Parliamentary discussion, by which 1 have been equally gratified and obliged. I am perfectly aware that in many respects, I shall stand in need of indulgence, but I indulge the hope, that the collection, with the accompanying notes, will be found, in a considerable degree, to have accomplished the purposes for which they are intended, and in case of any subsequent editions, shall be happy to avail myself of any suggestions for their correction and improvement.

INTRODUCTION.

Considerations on the Expediency, Policy, and Feasibility, of a Consolidation, and Systematic Arrangement of the Statute Law: with a view to its gradual Improvement.

The attention which has been paid to Style and Composition, has seldom been owing to disinterested exertion; and as well in this, as in every other department of Science and Art, self-love has been the exciting cause of rousing the attention and industry of mankind.

Legislation, though the most important, is with us, perhaps, the only branch of composition, in which the influence of this cause has not been felt. Our Statutes are framed, not by particular individuals, but by a fluctuating body; find their, merit and demerit, therefore, are ascribable, not to this person or that, but to an undistinguishable mass. And whilst in ev, ery other branch of composition, the desire to be approved by others ha3 prompted the study of communicating our thoughts with most advantage, and expressing our conceptions with the greatest propriety; from the want of this cause, our mode of legislating (for to the manner only are objections made) has continued in its original imperfect state.

A Revision of the Statute Book, in the way of Consolidation and Systematic Arrangement, was contemplated so early as the Reign of James the First, and has been sanctioned by the most eminent Lawyers of their time. The House of Commons, in their treaty, with his Majesty, for the Abolition of the Court of Wards, proposed a consolidation, that thereby “ All such enactments as are profitable concerning one matter, may be reduced into one Statute.”—“ For, ” says Lord Coke, upon another occasion, “as they now stand, it will require great pains in reading over all, great attention in observing, vol. i. h

XVlii INTRODUCTION.

and greater judgment in discerning upon consideration of the whole, what the law is in any one particular point/ ’

Lord Stanhopb’o motion, in 1616, was the last occasion of stirring this matter. His Lordship seems, from Mr. Hobnbr’s reported speech, to have had only a general impression of the necessity of some revision, without any distinct notion as to what that revision should be, and still less as to the mode of attaining it. Mr. Hornbr observed, (bat “ no definite plan had been proposed; and that be was at a loss to know what it was intended to do.” And it is owing, perhaps, to the want of some plan, by which a consolidation may be accomplished with comparative ease and safety, that it has never yet been attempted. The difficulty is, to obtain a clear comprehensive view of the result of multifarious enactments; and the danger, that, scattered as they are, some may be overlooked. Upon the supposition that the Plan, which will hereafter be proposed, will obviate these objections, are founded its claims to a favourable notice.* *

On the occasion alluded to, Mr. Hobnbr further remarked, that “ if it was intended merely to frame an Index to the Statute Book, or arrange the Acts without altering them in Form or Letter, it would be much better to leave any work of that kind to the industry and skill of individuals. The demand for such works would always be sufficient, to induce men of adequate talent to undertake them; and the labour was not beyond the compass of one man’s abilities.”

* It most be obvious to every person of common sente! who considers this matter with the most ordinary measure of attentions that no plan, or any thin#

* pproaMigto a plan, has ever yet been advanced. Had Lord Bacon, Sir Planers Bacon, or any ether of the great men who have written upon the mdgect, thrown on* even the most general roles for taking one single step in this arduous teak, it would have been a difficult matter, in any subsequent projector, to have established, with knowing people, his Clahn to originality. To unfold to a greater extent that prospect which another has opened «p, is a merit of quite a secondary order. And m the most simple operations appear iasunmonataUe to those, to whom the means of accomplishing them are unknown; it is evident, that the question of consolidating the Statutes, is now for the first time to be fairly dealt with.

INTRODUCTION.

xix

No one will dispute the justness of this remark; since the only oases for state interference are, —1. Where the project, though of the highest utility, is what the public will not sup* port; —2. Where it is intended as the Basis only of a Legislative Proceeding. To interfere in any other cases, would be to monopolize a common subject, and to exclude the claims of competitors; a proceeding unfair, as it regards individuals'; and injudicious, as it respects the public, from depriving the State of the advantages ef competition.

Mr. Hornbr continued, that a Consolidation, if intended, would be “ inconvenient, and altogether unadvisable, for this reason, that all the legal learning to be found in every branch of the Judicature would hardly be sufficient for such a task, on account of the intricacy of the questions that would arise in it.”

No one who foall propose to consolidate the Statutes, can be under any temptation of disguising the difficulties of the undertaking; for so obvious are the difficulties, that to attempt to disguise them, would only betray an ignorance of the subject. But surely if these difficulties may be surmounted, they form no objection to the measure. Amongst the number, however, that which Mr. Hornbr has mentioned, not only has no very extensive influence; it forms the strongest argumentin favour of the proposal. The only consolidation that could with safety be adopted, would leave the very language of foe Statutes exactly as at present, unless in the case of conflicting provisions. In the latter case only would any questions arise; and the sooner they are raised and disposed of, the greater the security. To leave them to arise in the course of practice, would haaard the chance of enactments being found deficient at the very time when their application was most wanted.

* Another objection is seedbed te Mr. Hoama which probably he never made, that A consolidation was n—oeoaeaiy.” Upon the (apposition that he was acquainted with the opinions ef Lord Bacon, Sir Edwako Coke, and Sir Matthnw Hsu, he woaM have replied to the specific reasons wMdi they have given for a consolidation, hi a different-way than by keeping In general*,

A consolidation Is requisite from the inconveniences occasioned, both in Legit

INTRODUCTION

These preliminary Objections having been disposed of, it .will next be considered, whether any of a higher nature, as derived from views of Policy, can be offered to the measure.

ation and in the Administration of Justice, by the want of it; and for the troth of this assertion, the experience of every one qualified to judge is appealed to.

Another objection is this—A clause taken in relation to other branches of the Act, shall occasionally bear a different construction to what it bears in the abstract—That in consolidating the law, yon most either take the clanse in its isolated form, and thereby change its meaning; or yon mast take it with all its collateral bearings, and thereby raise those various and intricate questions for the solution of which we have no oracle to apply to.

Now allowing this objection every possible weight of which it is susceptible -—even supposing it to be (as it is not) unanswerable and decisive; it obviously does not affect the writer's modified proposition. The objection applies to that case only where an immediate change in the existing state of our Law is contemplated; not to the present case where the only proposition is, that a basis shall be established for foture legislation, and that any change shall be brought about gradually and in the ordinary course. No ooe will dispute, that a clear and comprehensive view of the system in all its bearings and relations, and a reduction of it to that state in which those, who would improve its form, would, as an Indispensable preliminary, desire that it should be placed, is a tine qttanam to the perfection of future legislation. “ It is principally with a view to fnture legislation (observes one of the first statesmen of the age, in a letter to the writer upon this subject,) that the classification and arrangement of existing laws has always appeared to me to be so highly desirable.*' That the work will be altogether free from imperfection, is what no man can promise or expect. It is sufficient, if an assurance can be given from the method in which it will be accomplished, that it will probably be as perfect as the nature of things will admit.

Since, however, the other parts of this Essay have been addressed to the supposition, that the Statute Law will ultimately be consolidated—it is proper to consider this question also, as if an immediate consolidation (without time given to consider or reconsider the bearings of every clause) were contemplated.

The objection altogether proceeds on the supposition, that the framer of the original Act, intended that it should bear the relative and not the isolated aense; since if such was not his intention, the relative sense is the effect of accident, not of design, and a consolidation, therefore, instead of detracting from, will emphatically uphold the real character of the law.

Now the very same principles which govern in every other branch of composition (from letter writing to epic poetry,) must influence in framing an Act of Parliament. It is not conceivable, that any legislator in possession of his reason, ever meant to express himself in the ootset by halves, leaving it to a future clause to perfect the expression of his design. He meant that epck paragraph should fully define its subject. And by attending, therefore, to the meaning of each—isolated and by itself—shall we uphold what alone was the legislator's real meaning.

INTRODUCTION,

xxi

That it is no innovation is plain from reflecting, that, when accomplished, it will leave the sanctions, nay the very lanr guage of the Law, exactly as it found them. To use the yvords of Lord Bacon, “ It is matter of order and explanation, not of alteration; nothing speculative, but real and feasible; not going to the matter of the laws, but to the manner of their expression and tradition; giving rather light th$ni new nature; a pruning and grafting of the law, not a ploughing up and planting it again. The entire body and substance of law, shall remain, only discharged of idle and unprofitable or hurU ful matter, for there is such an accumulation of statutes concerning one matter, and they so cross and intricate, as the certainty of law is lost in the heap.”

The objection that may be offered is this—That any extensive reform, even in the mere order of a subject, begets a spirit of change, and disposes us to listen to more important alterations that may hereafter be proposed. Regulations, however directly advantageous, must be sacrificed, when indirectly they induce consequences more injurious to society than their own effects are beneficial.

The way in which that meaning comes to be changed, contrary to his intentions, arises from his employing terms in a snbseqnent paragraph, which necessarily influence, bat which were not intended to influence, the former. These cannot be rejected by a Judge, because he has no power te reject any part of a statute. But the legislator is under no such obligation.

At all events, however, some reliance mast be placed upon intelligence, and it mast be presumed, that the manner in which one clause may be influenced by another will not escape an anxious perusal of the Act.

Any sudden extensive change in the English law might, from its peculiar .character, produce the effect objected. It is thus characterised by the Abbl Raynal:—“ Comme son gouvernement actuel nrest qu’une rlforme de ce gouvernement feodal qui avoit oppriml toutel’Europe, il en a conserve bean-coup d'usages, qui n’etant dans i'origine que des abus de l’esclavgge, tout plus •ensibles encore par lew contrast© avec la liberty que le peuple a recoutrte.

To the formation and continuance of the social state, it was absolutely necessary, that we should be influenced by those principles whichare essential to its formation and continuande, that we should have an intuitive love for those actions which tend to unite men in society, and an abhorrence of those which drive us from each other, and tend, as it were, to break the bands of society asunder. Accordingly, the principle of moral approbation and disapprobation, is an internal, unaccountable feeling, which, without any view to their consequences, leads us to follow one course of action and reject another. We do not originally approve or condemn, because we have discovered, that the effects of the one are beneficial, those of the other injurious. Nature, antecedent to aH reflections on utility, bas stamped upon the human heart a predilection for these actions, and an aversion to those. And so happily ha9 she adjusted our sentiments of approbation and disapprobation to conveniency, that, so far as our experience extends, no rule of conduct is approved of, but what is either useful or agreeable; nor condemned, but what has an opposite tendency.

Now it is this Principle, or rather the rules of Morality which it teaches us to form, that are the basis of Jurisprudence, and to enforce their observance is its principal aim; and as the justness of the one implies that of the other, we must allow, that the basis of our Judicial System is precisely that upon which it ought to rest. Its imperfections have arisen from accidental causes, not from its leading principles, as will be

less removed from the immediate examination of our senses, to stimulate curiosity, and to present a reward to indostry.”

What Dr. Blair observes upon the Powers and Pleasures of Taste, may likewise be mentioned as in analogy—That << in these there is a more remarkable inequality among men than is usually found in point of common sense, reason, and judgment. The constitution of our nature in this, as in all other respects, discovers admirable wisdom. In the distribution of those talents which are necessary for man’s well-being, nature has made less distinction among her children. But in the distribution of those which belong only to the ornamental part of life, she hath bestowed her favours with more frugality. She hath both sown the seeds more sparingly, and rendered a higher culture necessary for bringing them to perfection.”

made evident when the sources of its imperfections shall be presently explained.

To prove that the Rules of Jurisprudence coincide with those of Morality, let us take an example from Griminal Law.

Though pleasure and pain are the primary sources of gratitude and resentment, yet a savage will distinguish between the man who designs him a benefit or injury, and one who occasions it without any intention. This distinction he must have learnt from Nature, and it leads to this consequence, that -from the earliest to the more advanced stages of society, our natural sentiments induce us to annex the quality of guilt to the disposition of mind, and to that alone, from which an injury proceeds.

When, however, we come to reason upon the sutgect, a doubt is cast upon the propriety of that doctrine which Nature teaches us to form. We are led by irresistible arguments to acknowledge, that those actions only are politically wrong, which are injurious to society; and as the injury which the act itself produces is palpable, and that which the intention produces, not only [is not obvious, but it is believed has never yet been explained, we doubt whether our natural sentiments do not deceive us, and whether our judgment should not be influenced rather by the consequences than by the motives of actions. And in this spirit, a philosophical jurisprudent has not scrupled to declare, that “ crimes are to be measured by the injury done to society; and that they err, therefore, who consider that a crime is greater or less according to the intention of the person by whom it was committed.” *

Nature, however, in this, as in every other instance, is justified by reason. The main evil which crime occasions to society is through the example which it holds out; and it so happens, that in proportion as the intention is vicious, in the same proportion is the example injurious. For, consider the mode in which example influences—it is by sympathy. We

The want of distinguishing between the Origin and Progress of Jurisprudence, and the origin and progress of all other sciences, has led many to venerate beyond their merits those who declared the first principles of our system, and others, to suppose that because they were laid down in the infancy of society, they must needs be erroneous. Both sides are agreed upon the imperfect state of the cotemporary sciences; but from not distinguishing the reason, the former, struck with the justness f of our main principles, are lost in admiration at minds that, when every thing else was dark around them, could discern their way along the path of social life; whilst the latter cannot imagine how only one ray of wisdom could illumine such a night of ignorance and erroK J

Deficiencies of the first sort imply no imperfection in toe general principles upon which our system Is founded, since they proceeded, not from those principles, but from a quite different cause. The same holds with defects of the second class. Aad with the last likewise, as will appear from toe following explanation.

The inconveniences of reducing toe Common Law to a Written Law, as was done by King Alfred, are these: So long as the law remained in an unwritten state, ho considerable check was imposed upon those by whom it was administered, against enlarging its rales or definitions to meet toe exigencies of the times. But when reduced to writing, (to say nothing of the authority which the act itself conferred,) limits were prescribed by the supreme power in the state, which the Judges could net afterwards transgress. Any farther improvement, therefore, mutt have flowed from that power, whose

energies, in the work of amendment, have always been paralysed by the want of that experience which the adminis^ tration of justice can alone supply; and it has seldom interposed, until evils have grown to an intolerable pitch. It is in particular instances only, that the insufficiency of a regulation is very obvious and discernible, and unluckily such instances rarely present themselves to those Members of the Legislature, from whom alone any material improvement must, by the operation of fixed moral causes, be expected. Lawyers who have proved exceptions to this rule, have owed their distinction to Nature and reflection, not to the genius of their profession.

Ajlprjbd’s code, it is true, was afterwards lost, but not until its influence had been felt, and a strict adherence to the limits of a rule hallowed by inveterate practice. To its loss, however, (and that of the other authoritative collections,) we owe those occasional improvements, which the common law receives at the hands of the Judges. It is optional with a court of judicature to follow the rules prescribed by their predecessors; but the commands of the Legislature must be implicitly obeyed. Lord Mansfibld appears to have listened very readily to the suggestions of improvement; yet such is the influence of example, and such the contagion of opinion, that what was the offspring of that extraordinary good sense which regulated a genius the most comprehensive of his age, is generally regarded as the reproach of his judicial character.

The great practical conclusion, therefore, to which the researches of an eminent theoritician have led—the propriety of converting the Common Law to Statute Law, seems, in the present state of our judicial system, to be very questionable, nay singularly unfortunate. So Jong as that state remains the same, the only improvement of which, through the medium of codification, the Common Law appears susceptible, is, first, a Digest of Judicial Decisions f which, without possessing a

Legislative authority, shall be framed under sanctions that may secure its accuracy; secondly, an annual incorporation, with the digest of the decisions of the preceding year.* The Common Law could advantageously be reduced to writing only after establishing a permanent Court that might form a connecting medium between the Legislature and the ordinary courts of justice, and render the experience of the one available by the other. In the “ Idea of a perfect Commonwealth, ” there is a “ Council of Laws, ” whose duty is to examine, from time to time, what improvements may be made in the Municipal Law. f

* % Not to mention the greet practical advantages which, in the administration of justice, would result from such a Code; it seems essential to legislation, that previous to the introduction of a new bill, the existing state of the law should be thoroughly known and considered, which, from the want of a Code, cannot at present be accomplished.

t For Mr. Bentham's remarks upon the propriety of converting the Common Law to Statute Law, we must refer the reader to his papers on Codification.— The following reidarks are from the Review of the French Code d’ Instr. Crim.

“ The first peculiarity'that strikes us in this French System, is, that every part of the procedure is regulated by precise written authority: and this we cannot help regarding as a very considerable advantage. Nothing is of to much importance to a people, in regard to their laws, as that they should be indisputable, unvarying, and notorious. But the great use and advantage of writing is, that it imparts those qualities to whatever has been committed to It; and fines rule admitting of no doubt, or variation, or concealment When a man wishes to fix steadily one of his own thoughts, and for the use of his own mind, he writes it down; —much more a thought which he wants to present steadily to the mind of any other person. How strange is it then, that nations, far advanced in civilisation, should qHow any important part of their laws to remain unwritten! Yet such, with exceptions almost incredibly small, is the account which is truly to be rendered of the practical state of the Law, not only as it has been, but as it now is, all over the world.

“ Not but that there are certain rules that in the coarse of time have acquired a technical notoriety, and a sort of traditionary authority. Without something of this sort, society could not have existed: hut still the roles are not absolutely certain; they are known only to practitioners in the law; and they may be violated or transgressed by rash or corrupt [to which we may add, or improved by enlightened] judges.

" The utmost improvement which such a jurisprudence has been found capable of receiving, seems to be attained by making it a rule, that whatsoever had been done by preceding judges, should be done by succeeding onesa rule that mn&t always be liable to dispute, and must frequently admit of np application, where cases occurred under new or extraordinary circumstances.

" If the judge does, what a man of a pure and vigorous mind, in such a situation, would naturally do; that is, endeavour? from a view of the particular

Another evil may be noticed, that is rather formidable In the distance, than influencing, at present, to any great extent namely, the .notion of introducing a technical Nomenclature throughout the whole extent of our Judicial system. Not to mention, that in spite of the multiplicity of set forms of expression, applying to particular cases, that might be promulgated, yet upon account of the still greater variety of possible circumstances, it would constantly occur, among all those forms there would not be found one exactly parallel to the case under consideration, and that, therefore, it is a vain attempt to introduce accuracy into a subject that does not admit of H: The only cases m which a Nomenclature can, with any safety, be fixed-, are those proceedings, (pleadings for example) in which lawy&s are unavoidably employed, and where time is not essentially an otyect. Here without any impropriety, and frequently with great advantage, there are a number of phrases, to which the Courts annex an artificial meaning, and which they will interpret in that sense only. No inconvenience arises from this, since these matters are conducted by men trained up in the science of which these forms are a part. But to introduce m technical Nomenclature throughout the whole extent of the Judicial system, would not merely throw the most ordinary aflairs of life into the hands of lawyers; it would introduce endless misery, by taking from those who either had not the means, or the opportunity of employing professional men, the power of acting. The notion, indeed, has been partially carried into effect. In some instances, set forms of expression

have certain Maas, in exclusion of all others, annexed to them, as In the Law of Devises; a practice that has been deplored by Judges as enlightened as those who introduced it. In Its origin, perhaps, it sprang from that rage for simplicity, which, by making every thing bend to a single principle, and that done govern system, has introduced so much confusion into science. BII y a, " says the President Montbiquisc, “ de certaines iddes d’mrifonntte qui saississent qoeiqnefois les grands esprifs (car elles ont touchd Cuarlxmagnb) man qni frappent iafiaffiblemeat lee petit*. 11s y trouvent m genre de perfection qu’ils reconnoissent, parce qu’il est impossible de ne le pas ddcouvrir; les monies poids dans la police, les mfimes meseies dans leoeemneree, les mhmes k>ix dans l’Etat, la mtme religion dans tontes see parties.

Another evil ton, with which we have been threatened, is the proposal to subject the rules of Jurisprudence to a land o moral arithmetic. But an antidote to tins poison (for the writer can conceive nothing more mischievous) will always be supplied by “ the habitual influence of those first principles of propriety, of morality, and of common sense, which, as long to reason maintains her ascendant, exercise a paramount authority over all those speculative conclusions which have any connexion with the business of life.”—“ I admit, ” says Sir Gil-bbrt Ellioit in his correspondence with Mr. Home, “ that there is no writing or talking of any subject which is of importance enough to become the object of reasoning, without having recourse to some degree of subtilty and refinement. The only question is, where to stop, how fiur we can go, and why no farther? To this question I should be extremely happy to receive a satisfactory answer. I can’t tell if I shall rightly express what I hare just now in my mind; but I often imagine to myself, that I perceive within me a certain instinctive feeling, which shoves away at once all over-subtile refine* men ts, and taUs ma, with authority, that these air-built notions, are inconsistent with life and experience, and by consequence

cannot be true or solid. From this I am led to think, that the speculative principles of our nature ought to go hand in hand with the practical ones; and, for my own part, when the for*: merare so far pushed, as to leave the latter quite out of sight, I am always apt to suspect that we have transgressed our limits. If it should be asked, how far will these practical principles go ? 1 can only answer, that the former difficulty will recur, unless it be found that there is something in the intellectual part of our nature, resembling the moral sentiment in the moral part of our nature, which determines this as it were instinctively.”

Mistaken analogy Is likewise the source of one or two im- perfections. Thus, the rule in Criminal Law* is, that the propagator of seditious news, shall be imprisoned until he produces the first author of the tale. From reasoning in analogy to which rule has arisen the practice in cases of civil injury, that no action shall lie against one, who merely gives publicity to the reproach of another, as such. That this practice is unjust, is plain from reflecting, that the slander is diffused beyond the limits that would otherwise have confined its operation, ' and the injury to the party’s feme proportionably increased; for this additional injury he is entitled to a compensation; he cannot demand it against the original defemer, for it was not his act which occasioned the inconvenience; from the propagator of the slander, therefore, should be be allowed to seek redress. And to shew that the practice has no reason in its favour, examine the two causes which were assigned when it became necessary to justify it; —1. That nq additional weight is thereby given to the primitive charge;

2. That the propagator thereby gives the plaintiff a cause of action against the original defemer. To which latter end it is essential, that the name of the accuser be given up, and the repetition be of the very identical words he used, and not merely synonymous expressions. So that to say, a certain person, not naming him, declared, or that the common report is, that the plaintiff is a felon, is actionable. So, likewise, to assert, that I. . accused the plaintiff in substance and to the

radii

effect following, cannot be justified, because in an action against the original defiuner, the plaintiff could not expressly aate in his declaration, that such was the effect of the slander, nor could he by using words of that import in his count, recover by proving synonymous expressions.—1. As to the reason first assigned j if it be the true one, it seems to follow, that generally to assert (according to the fact) that the plaintiff stands accused by another, not specifying his name, or that the common report says that he is guilty, is not injurious, because the weight of the relator’s own opinion is not thereby.added to the charge. Rot it is actionable, and consequently the reason first assigned will not hold.—2. As to the second reasonj it is not easy to perceive, how the plaintiff is, by the information, compensated for the additional inconvenience which we have shewn that he sustains. And besides, if it be the true one, it seems to follow, that a communication made to the plaintiff of the name of the original slanderer, at any time previous to instituting an action against the propagator, will be sufficient to exonerate him from liability. But the consequence is not admitted, and in order to be secure, he must at the time give up the author’s name, and declare expressly that I. . told him so.

In like manner, where the provisions of a Statute are only such, as, had the matter been argued, would have been pronounced to be the common law rule, the doctrine so declared, has been taken to have been originated by the Statute Law. And thus, in analogous cases, an argument is introduced, that, as the particular case provided for was without protection until the Statute passed, so, likewise, are all those that are in analogy to it.

* These sources of imperfection are all which hare occurred to me; and perhaps, as I observed before, the three first are the only ones, that can be considered as having exercised any very extensive influence. A position which seems justified by Adam Smith’s opinion; who, in declaring the censes of the imperfections of jurisprudence, says—1“ In all well governed states, not only Judges are appointed for determining the controversies of individuals, but rules are prescribed for regulating the decisions of those Judges; and these rules are, in general, intended to coincide with those of natural justice. It does not, indeed, always happen, that they do so in every instance. Some* times what Is called the Constitution of the State, that is, the interest of the

The^foregoMig vemarks apply to the mutter of Jurisprudence. With respect to the Form; —though-for many of its forms sufficient reasons can be given, others there are which may not scP readily be traced to their original; unless we consider them a* invented by the lawyers of old, to confine the conduct of a cause to themselves or as the offspring of chance made sacred by time and habit; or ascribe them to a zeal for that system and method, which ennoble even the meanest art, and give it the air of science and wisdom. But from whatever source they sprung, it seems proper, unless plainly inconvenient, * to preserve them, to avoid as well the possibility of error, as the disputes which may arise on every innovation. In practice, moreover, they engage our attention only in company with the matter of Jurisprudence; we come, therefore, to consider them as necessary parts of an entire system; the veneration which properly belongs to the substance, is undistinguishably extended to the form; so that any interference with the one may weaken our respect for the other. Add to which, like the

government; sometimes the interest of particular orders of men who tyrannize the government, warp the positive laws of the country from whit natural justice would prescribe. In some countries the rudeness and barbarism of the people hinder the natural sentiments of justice from arriving at that accuracy and precision which, in more civilized nations, they* naturally attain to Their laws are like their manners, gross, and rude, and undistingnishing. In other countries, the unfortunate constitution of their court* of judicature hinders any regular System of jurisprudence from ever establishing itself among them, though the improved manners of the people may be sneb, as would admit of the most accurate. In no country do the decisions of positive law coincide exactly, In every case, with the rules which the natural sense of justice would dictate. Systems of positive law, therefore, though they deserve the greatest authority, as the records of the sentiments of mankind in different ages and nations, yet can never be regarded as accurate systems of the rules of natural justice.”

splendour of an official garment they captivate the imagination, and lead the unthinking to infer, that what is thus distinguished from the other objects of our acquaintance must merit a super rior admiration. They likewise withdraw the attention from the substance itself, and prevent its becoming familiar to those who are unable to appreciate its real claims to respect.

A religious adherence to established forms, has invariably distinguished the Sages of the English Law. However untenable on principles of reason, it-ls sufficient that they are warranted by precedent. For, as observed long ago, by Mr. Justice Staunvord, on the question, whether an averment by the term “ Licet” was sufficient, “ If it was the usual form to allege it by licet, then Lwould hold with it.” And, after instancing certain cases, in which the omnipotence of custom over reason was conspicuous, he continues, “ Wherefore we ought to adhere to the usual forms. But, in this cose, it is. not the usual form to allege the election under the word licet, as you may see in the book of Entries. Therefore, inasmuch as he has not adhered to the usual form, but has chosen such words as to him seemed proper for the matter, we ought not to hold with the words more than they will warrant.” So likewise, upon another occasion, though at first it was considered, that an avowry was bad for want of being averred 5 “ yet afterwards, ” says the Reporter, “ the Prothonotaries searched their precedents, and told the Justices, that the usual form was to allege the avowry without averment j with which the Justices were satisfied.”

2. But secondly. Even admitting that the first position—that the basis of our Judicial system is precisely that upon which it ought to rest, has not been established 3 the objection may be obviated by shewing, that there are no means of convincing us, that a change of system will ameliorate our condition.

Those who quarrel with the existing state of things, must establish beyond suspicion, first, the insufficiency of the present system; secondly, that the advantages of the proposed change overbalance the inconveniences which the disturbance will occasion; for every institution raises around it a family

of connexious and dependents, who must all be disturbed by interfering with the parent institution.

To accomplish this, the advocate for a change must bring to his subject subject such a knowledge of human nature—of the relations of society—of the various ways in which they are affected by the present system—and of the still more various and possible ways in which they may be affected by the projected change, as, judging from experience, beings of a higher order can alone possess.

u II n’appartient, " says Montesquieu, “ de proposer dea changemens qu’ k ceux qui sont assez heureusement nls pour plnltrer d’un coup de glnie toute la constitution d’un etat.” And the observation of the Abbl Raynal is equally judicious:

-—“ L’Etat est une machine trfes compliqule, qu’on ne peut monter ni faire agir sans en connoitre toutes les pieces. On n’en sauroit presser ou relkcher une seule que toutes les autres n’en soient derangles. Tout projet utile pour une dasse de citoyens ou pour un moment de crise, peut devenir funeste k toute la nation, et nuisable pour un long avenir. Detruisez ou denaturez un grand corps; ces mouvemens convulsifs qu’on appelle coups d’etat, agiteront la masse national©, qui s’en ressentira peut-etre durant des siscles. Toutes les innovations doivent Itre insensible, naitre du besoin, Atre inspires par une sort de cri public, ou du moins s’accorder avec le voeu general. Anlantir ou crier tout a coup, c’est empirer le mal et corrompre le bien. Agir sans consulter la volontl glnlral, sans recueiller, pour ansi dire, la plurality des suffrages dans l’opinion publique; c’est alilner les coeurs et les esprit, tout dlcrlditer, mime le bon et i’honnlte.” *

• Upon the subject of paftial innovation, Sir William Evans has made the following very sensible remarks“ The objection (against an amendment of the law) proceeding from a fair and laudable attachment to existing institutions, and an apprehension of the detriment and inconvenience which would arise to the community by encouraging a deviation from them, is a principle in itself most just and reasonable; which in every instance not only admits, but requires the greatest caution and circumspection; bnt which, I apprehend, is, in its practical application, carried to an extreme degree of timidity, so as to militate against that general utility which, within its proper limits, it is most essentially calculated to promote.

INTRODUCTION* XXXVii

•' It is a part of the plan for consolidating the Statute Law, that will hereafter be proposed, to arrange the enactments in a systematic form. And upon this account, also, may objections, derived from views of policy, be offered to the measure;

“ There is (he is speaking with reference to the general question of the propriety and expedience of admitting an alteration of the Law, in cases in which, upon a fair and candid examination, such alteration may be recsonably expected, in its general consequences, to be beneficial to the community) of coarse no difference of opinion, where the change proposed Is clearly and evidently of the description referred to; and an admission of the beneficial tendency of a measure with reference to the whole of its effects, is an admission of the wisdom and propriety of its adoption. The material question for examination is, whether there is not in many persons of the purest intention and of very enlightened understanding, too strong a predisposition to reject any suggestion of a particular change, as being an infraction of settled principles, regarded with veneration and respect; —too great a disinclination to bring to the subject that spirit of fair and candid examination, by which alone the real merits of a proposal for deviating from ancient usage can be justly and reasonably tried. Upon this subject I cannot but feel a strong impression, that instead of the cautions and useful spirit of analytical examination, certain f&vonrite watch-words are too frequently resorted to and exposed from one quarter to another, in a tone and manner rather calculated to silence inquiry, than to induce a rational assent and conviction. The dangers of innovation— the cry of mere novelty—the preference of practice to specalation, of experience to theory—and the full and general chorus embracing all these in a sweeping and indiscriminate appeal to the wisdom of our ancestors/ afford a set of phrases which can be applied at pleasure with mechanical repetition, an imposing air, and powerful effect; and cerUinly with much less trouble of thooght and investigation than is requisite for forming an adequate decision of the salutary or prejudicial consequences of any existing institution, and the general sum of benefit or injury which may be reasonably expected from its abolition or connection.

“ I trust, that from long acquaintance with, and & well known attachment to the existing system of the Laws and Institutions of the Country, I have as little disposition to encourage a wanton spirit of experimental change, as the most clamorons advocate for the indiscriminate continuance of existing institutions. —I am fully satisfied of the advantage of adhering to settled habits and known rules of conduct and procedure—of the important and intimate connection prevailing between the different component parts of the same general and united system—of the cantions circumspection which, in contemplating a promised benefit, should watch with minute and scrupulous attention the probability of a consequential mischief. In deciding between an existing establishment and a suggested alteration, I am fully sensible of the error of being influenced by mere considerations of abstract propriety, as applied by a priori reasoning, to the adoption of the one system or the other in the choice of a new and original establishment; and I fully admit, that in order to induce an alteration, there should be a strong and manifest evidence of the injurioos tendency of the existing practice, as a strong and manifest preponderance in favour of the offered substitution.

It may be objected to a systematic arrangement, first, that experience has shown, that the most effectual expedient for extinguishing whatever degree of good sense there may be in any moral doctrine, is to reduce it to a scholastic technical

“ It certainly is difficult to conceive upon what principles, it should be assumed, that while every other science has been progressive, and followed the natural course of observation and experience in the correction of errors and the extension of useful discovery, the sciences of Legislation and Jurisprudence should alone be considered as stationary and retrograde.—The true cause, however, of the excessive Dread of Innovation, appears to be the extreme to which an opposite principle has been carried, and the veiy serious evils which have in fact resulted from it, insomuch, that a dread of the consequences arising, from the mere spirit of captious and wanton change has been extended to the discouragement and suppression of an inclination in favour of gradual, temperate, and practical improvement. At a period when attempts have been made to lessen the attachment of the subjects of Great Britain to the Political Constitution which they enjoy, it is not surprising that the spirit of adherence to that Constitution has extended itself to the more particular details of practical jurisprudence with which it is connected, and that any attempt to ameliorate the one has been resisted as indicating a disposition to subvert and violate the other.

“ The following considerations upon this subject, by Mr. Bentham, appear to me to be perfectly judicious and well-founded.—The constitutional branch of the Laws of England is admirable in many respects. The composition of the Legislative Body is nearly a model of perfection. Such, at least, has been the opinion of a great number of judicious and impartial persons; an opinion which will appear the more just, the more this constitution is considered in relation with the situation and circumstances of the people who eqjoy this inestimable advantage. Another part of the Law which has a great connection with the preceding, and which likewise merits great encomium for some of its fundamental principles, is the organization of the tribunals, the publicity of procedure, the trial by jury in political questions, the liberty of the press, the habeas corpus, the right of assembly and petition, and some others, which are the segis of public and individual liberty. This excellent basis of Legislation is the first in point of importance, bnt compared with the total mass of the faws, it is not the hundredth part; yet it is easy to perceive, that the esteem which is due to the constitutional branch naturally extends itself to all the others, by a simple and easy process of the imagination, and still more of the affections. The good seems a safeguard to the bad. It does not enter into the mind to suppose, that, together with such excellent laws, any bad ones can be allowed to subsist; a natural prepossession is formed in favour of the whole; esteem refuses an alliance with contempt; and the high opinion which is formed of one part of the Code is an obstacle to every examination which would tend to degrade another.”

There are some observations in the Review of the French Code destruction Criminelle, with which we shall conclude this note.

“ It sounds a little like the beginning of. a tritical Essay to say, that there is nothing which is of so much consequence for a people to know, as the excelnTRODOCTION.

system of artificial definitions and divisions; and that as in every instance there is the strictest, analogy between morals and jurisprudence, and in most instances they ace the same— truths applicable to the one muBt apply to the other.

This objection has two branches; one relating to Definition, the other to Classification. It is. only, however, by resolving the.latter into, the former, that its truth can be admitted; since it is not conceivable that mere Classification can be attended with any such results, unless it .be so constructed, as to be, in effect, a more enlarged species of Definition.—The evils of Definition seem to be the following.

A Definition tends to prejudice the mind in favour of dm position'which it inculcates, and either to induce a .neglect of farther experiment, or an indisposition to attend toy or

leades >nd defects of their laws. But it is dot quite tritical, we believe, to say that it is of infinitely more consequence that they should know the defects, than the excellencies of their laws; and that there is nothing with which they are so unwilling to be made acquainted. The little sentiment of personal consequence attaches itself to all the Institutions under which we have been accus? tomed to live. Onr family, our country, oar laws, onr government—must be better than ail other families, countries, laws, and governments!—And in thin temper which is habitual to the greatest partof mankind, and to thp least on* lightened the most remarkably, we would rather bear all the evils resulting from the defects of onr jaws, than allow, that there can be any defects in the laws of so \ronderful a people. rW0i trtavrov, which the highest authority ban converted into a role of Christian perfection, useful and difficult as it may be to individuals, is perhaps still more highly useful to communities, aodatiH more difficult to practise. Of their overweening partialities to themselves personally) men, if they are not the weakest of men, are generally ashamed; blit national partialities, how weak and ridiculous soever, are boasted of as patriotism, and he who would reason against them, runs some risk of being treated as aa enemy to his country. Yet there is no way in which false notions of himself are likely to J>e prejudicial to an individual, in which a similar error Is not likely to produce still worse consequences to a nation."

* “ It is, " says Dugald Stewart, u very judiciously observed by Mr. Busks, in his Essay on Taste, that when we define, we are in danger of cir-eaasscribing Nature within the bounds of pur own notions, which we often take.op by toward, or embraceon trust, or form out of a limited and partial' consideration of the object before ns, instead of extending our ideas to take in all that Nature comprehends, according to her manner ef combining* Wo are limited in.our inquiry , by the strict laws to which we have submitted at onr setting ont."

even perceive distinctly those which are contradictory. It is only, therefore, after an extensive course of experiment, affording' with consent of aU inquirers uniform results, with the probability of no contradictory phenomena, that we can, with any safety, generalize from particular instances.

Such then are the evils of Definition, and such the evils which the objection deprecates; and its force will be allowed, when the Classification proposed shall be shown to have the tendency of Definition.

Secondly, it may be -objected, that by exhibiting a lucid and systematic view of the Statute Law, its doctrines will be rendered more familiar, of which if any are unfriendly to the spirit of the Constitution, they will, in the end, lose their revolting features, and the mind be insensibly disposed to view, with indifference, doctrines of a similar nature. But the answer to this objection is, that it is not known that any such are to be found.

One more objection, on the score of policy, remains, namely, the difficulty in ascertaining, whether the work, when completed, comprehends, without the minutest exception, every enactment. Which objection is answered by showing, that proper media can be furnished for deciding upon its sufficiency. An Analysis of the Consolidation will, in the first instance, be submitted to those who are to decide upon its merits, who, by progressively erasing the enactments in the Statute Book to which the placita in the Analysis correspond, will, by mere inspection, discover, in the end, whether any omissions have occurred.

And thus, having disposed of the objections that may be offered to the Policy of the measure, the Plan itself upon which - - 11 ---• “ Although/* says Mr. Locke, “ our knowledge begins in particulars, and so spreads itself by degrees to generals; yet afterwards the mind takes quite the contrary course, and having drawn its knowledge into as general proposition# as it can, makes them familar to its thoughts, and accustoms itself to have recourse to them, as to the standards of truth and falsehood.” Quoted by Dugald Stkwajit.

It is proposed to Consolidate the Statutes, should now be explained. Since, however, mere description would convey but very crude and indistinct notions of this plan, unless accompanied by illustration, and as the latter would extend this essay to a very unreasonable length, it has been judged best not to open it here. The results of its operation are exemplifying in Bills that will progressively be Introduced.

We shall therefore conclude with some observations on the proposed Arrangement of the Consolidation—that of the Commentaries.

It may be objected, that the mode of Classification proposed is not the best, in that either an Alphabetical, or a Philosophical Arrangement should be adopted.

With respect to an Alphabetical Arrangement; it is observable, that the particular arrangement preferable to every other, is that best suited to the end in view; or the most important end, where more than one are contemplated. Now the ends of classifying the Statutes are two:—1. To give notoriety to their provisions, by presenting them in a shape that shall make a lasting impression upon the memory; 2, To facilitate reference. Of these ends, the first is the most important, and can only be accomplished by a Systematic Arrangement.

With regard to a Philosophical Arrangement, or that by which the various Relations of the subject would be distinguished; there are two objections to it.

First, it is remote from common practice, so that by adopting it, we should sacrifice the maxim, that the method of communicating knowledge must be adapted to the state of the recipients, and a deference be paid to custom, and the humour and genius of those whom we address.

- Secondly, it is useless, as will appear from the following considerations.

INTRODUCTION *

ftlii

A Relation is, where, in some way or other, this person or thing is connected with that. So far as Morals and Juris* prudence are concerned, there is nothing real in the Relations which may be established between their several parts; since it is not because such and such parts are connected with each other, that such and such consequences therefore follow. If then, in this respect, there is nothing real in the doctrine of Relation, no attempt should be made to reason from it, or to arrange a subject with such a view. Hence the errors of L’Espmt dks Loix, wherein all the Principles are deduced from certain pre-established Relations. And hence the propriety of Mr. Hume’s opinion, that this theory which supposes all right to be founded on certain Rapports or Relations, is a system which never will be reconciled with true Philosophy.

To this system, that doctrine of proportioning Punishments to Crimes, which has misled so many respectable men, owes its authoritative stamp; a doctrine which not only seeks to introduce a frivolous accuracy into a subject which does not admit of it; but is deduced solely from the theory of Relation, without (it is submitted) the smallest foundation in reason to support it.

To mark the different relations in Jurisprudence, can only be necessary for the purpose of analogy; which means the similarity or sameness, not of two things, but of two Relations* By observing a similarity between the Relations of things, we discover that the things themselves are similar, and thence infer, that the same properties are common to both* But what end can be served by this process in a system of positive law, like the Statutes, that shall compensate the inconveniencies of the arrangement which it would introduce, is not conceivable by the writer. It may frequently, indeed, be a convenient method, to treat of two subjects under one point of view; but good sense, rather than any pre-established rules, must regulate this matter.

If then as well a Philosophical, as an Alphabetical Arrangement, must be rejected; what remains but to follow that of

INTRODUCTION. Xllii

Sir William Blackstone ?* To justify the whole by a part, examine the Arrangement of his Fourth Book.

The Principal Heads under which the Criminal Code may be arranged, are one of the following three :—1. The different Punishments annexed to the different species of offence; as Death and Transportation; 2. The Subject-matters of offence; as Persons and Property; 3. The Generical names of the different kinds of offence; as Treason and Felony.

By electing the first mode, this question is perpetually suggested; whether the same punishment should be annexed to two or more different offences:a question which, if of any, is of the highest importance to be suggested. Since, however, this mode of Arrangement has no other advantage to balance the inconveniencies which attend it, f it must be re* It has been well observed, that “ no plan of Classification could be devised, with which all parties would he satisfied. The famons compilers of the Civil Law, had their discordant notions as to Classification; and the three great Works which have shed such lustre on the reign of Justinian—the Code, the Institutes, and the Pandects, are each arranged after a different manner/ ’

What Johnson has remarked in speaking of Pope’s Essay on Criticism, changing what should be changed, will account for this diversity—“ Almost every Poem consisting of Precepts, is so far arbitrary and unmethodical, that many of the Paragraphs may change places, with no apparent inconvenience; for of two or more positions depending upon some remote and general principle, there is seldom any cogent reason why one should precede the other. It is possible, says Hooker, that by long circumduction, from any one truth all may be inferred. Of all homogeneous truths at least, of all truths respecting the same general end, in whatever series they may be produced, a concatenation by intermediate ideas may be formed, such as, when it is once shown, shall appear natural; but if this order he reversed, another mode of connexion equally specious may be found or made. Aristotle is praised for naming Fortitude first of the Cardinal Virtues, as that without which no other virtue can steadily be practised; but he might, with equal propriety, have placed Pru* dence and Justice before it, since without Prudence, Fortitude is mad; without Justice, it is miscliievons.”

“ As the end of method is Perspicuity, that series is sufficiently regular that avoids obscurity.”

♦ It seems to have been the mode which suggested itself to Lord Stanhope, since in the first number of the Edinburgh Monthly Review, it is (very rndely) remarked, that “ the most fanciful and absurd Arrangement ever heard of, was that of Lord Stanhope, whereby all the Acts imposing the Punishment of the Pillory, were to he Consolidated into one Act.”

jected, for the question proposed is (as it seems to the writer) of no sort of importance.

* The olgection to annexing the tame punishment to different offences, stands upon this footing—that thereby the same punishment is extended to crimes of very different character and malignity. Which objection may be stated more at large, and answered in the following manner.

At where different actiont are by Nature made the objects of RsamtsMnf, the idea of (what shall be called) Moral Guilt, is in the same or in different degrees annexed to each, exactly as they are made the objects of the same or of different degrees of Resentment; so where different actions are by Law made the objects of the idea of (what shall be called) Legal Guilt it in the

tame or in different degrees annexed to each, exactly as they are made the objects of the same or of different degrees of Punishment. Now this distinction in onr ideas of moral guilt having been ordained by Nature, to excite our resentment more strongly against certain offences, and thereby more effectually deter us from committing them, it is of importance to keep it alive. Any institution, therefore, which tends to confound this distinction, is so far injurious. And this tendency is ascribed to a system, which annexes the same punishment to offences differing in degrees of turpitude: equalizing the punishment, it is thought, has the effect of equalizing the idea of guilt.

This Theory altogether depends upon the notion, that our natural sentiments lie entirely under the dominion of opinion; so that when the opinion of others is contrary to the voice of Nature, the former will prevail. That the law (the opinion of the community) having declared, that certain offences which Nature has made distinct are all involved in the same degree of guilt, we are so entirely under the inffuence of its dictates, that we come to feel no greater abhorrence at one crime than another.

The agreement, or disagreement, both of the sentiments and judgments of other people with our own, is in all cases of more or less importance to us, and therefore in all cases exercises more or less influence over us, exactly in proportion as we ourselves are more or less uncertain about the propriety of onr own sentiments, about the accuracy of our own judgments. Where our uncertainty is very great, its dominion is unbounded; but where Nature has planted within our own breasts the standard of truth and falsehood, it exercises none.

To exemplify this by the doctrine of a profound philosopher—There are some very noble and beautiful arts, in which the degree of excellence can be determined only by a certain nicety of taste, of which the decisions, however, appear always, in some measure, uncertain. There are others in which the success admits of dear demonstration. Among the candidates for excellence in these different arts, the anxiety about the public opinion is always much greater in the former than in the latter.

Thus, the beauty of Poetry is a matter of such nicety, that a young beginner can scarce ever be certain that he has attained it. Nothing, therefore, delights him so much, as the favourable judgments of his friends and of the public; and nothing mortifies him so severely as the contrary. The one establishes, the other shakes, the good opinion which he is anxious to entertain concerning his own performances. Experience and success may in time give him a little more confidence in his own judgment. He is at all times, however, liable to be most severely mortified by the unfavourable judgments of the public. MathematiINTRODUCTION

By adopting the Second mode of Arrangement invariably, and without any exception. Crimes essentially differing in their properties and incidents, will be herded together) and not, therefore, so easily remembered in regard to their different

riant on the contrary, who may have the most perfect assnraoce both of the troth and of the importance of their discoveries, are commonly very indifferent about the reception which they may meet with from the public.

Now if this reasoning be just, it is fatal to the theory under consideration. For, as with mathematical, so, though upon different grounds, it is with those instinctive judgments which Nature teaches os to form in order to advance the ends of oor creation. The love of security and property (the objects of Jurisprudence) are obviously principles instinctive and original, being operations of too much consequence in life to be trusted to the slow and uncertain process of experience and reasoning. And so, likewise, are the judgments which we form respecting their violation; nor do they, in any degree, * lie under the influence of opinion. The world united could not persuade a man, who has been deprived of his finger, that bis calamity is greater than had his arm been amputated; or one who bas been robbed of the whole of his property, that his misfortune Is less afflicting than had he lost a part. To annex, therefore, the same punishment to crimfcs of different malignity, will never change the sentiments which they naturally excite. The only effect will be, as we have daily proof, to induce 11s to rail at enactments, which to our limited, though natural view, seem to be unjust.

Bat how erroneous soever this system (of proportioning punishments to crimes) may be, it could never have imposed upon so many, had it not, in some respects, been founded in Nature. As different injuries naturally excite different degrees of resentment, we are natnrally disposed to chastise some more severely than others. A scale of punishment becomes from tikis'cause a familiar notion, and when from any circumstance our attention is turned to its original, we pronounce it in common with the rest of our opinions, to be the offspring of reason. In searching, however, for the reason, we can find none plausible but that already mentioned, and which, therefore, we necessarily adopt. Hie Lei Talitmv, too, wherever it bas obtained, has strengthened this idea of a scale of punishment, and it seems to have obtained in the infancy of most societies. A distinct idea of the true end and probable influence of punishment, can alone suggest distinct ideas of Us proper measure. The Ideas, therefore, of rude legislators are upon this, as upon all other complex subjects, in confusion. The notion of exact retaliation readily presents itself to the coarsest understanding; and upon this they rest, as well from the specious appearance which it carries in its face, as to escape from the uneasiness of a state of perplexity and hesitation. Still farther strengthened is this idea of graduated punishment, by the gradation which obtains in every civilised code; induced, however, by the circumstance of this penalty being efficacious in one crime, that only in another.

If it be said, that many Crimes of positive institution (as the phrase is) excite alike the same degree of detestation, and that as some in their effects are mere injurious than others, it is necessary by severer punishments, to increase our abhorrence for the latter; it may be answered, that no such consequence will follow; it being an old truth, that if the crime does not excite our detestation,

peculiarities. An inconvenience avoided by classing Crimes under the Generical names of the different kinds of offence. Such, accordingly, has been the usual plan of Sir William Blackstone.

In his Internal Arrangement he is equally judicious. There are certain general matters which equally apply to all Classes of offence; for example. Modes of Procedure; and hence certain General Divisions must Le established, under which these matters may be noticed. Sometimes, however, one species of offence shall be distinguished from all the rest, and instead of being subjected to the General Regulations, shall affect Others peculiar to itself. Now these peculiarities may be noticed either under the head which treats of the offence itself, or under that which treats of the General Regulations to which the peculiarities form an exception. For example, the rule in High Treason, allowing the accused a list of the Crown Witnesses, may either be noticed under the division which treats of the Crime of Treason, gr under that which treats of Trial and Conviction. By electing the latter, a variety of enactments having no particular connection with each other— connected only through the medium of some General Idea, will be united in the same place; and thereby also enactments will be dissevered from the subject to which they are intimately and naturally related. Accordingly Sir William Blackstone has usually adopted the former mode; though

(and, by the same reason, any particular degree of it) the punishment never will. In spite of the Pillory, political libellers were always commiserated.

Our sense of the enormity of Crime maybe deadened by custom, as the state of men, brought up amidst licentiousness, proves. But the boundaries between one crime and another, so long as we regard them both as crimes, can never be obliterated. In this particular, custom can only pervert our sentiments by transforming Vice to Virtue, and connecting a vicious practice with the semblance of utility; as was the case with the Greeks in the article of Infanticide.

But Charity - Most dangerous is that temptation, that doth goad us on To Sin in loving Virtue.

* The French Code, to a certain extent, sanctions the same General Principles of Arrangement, with this addition, that under its General Divisions placita are introduced referring to what, though related to the general doctrine of which it is then treating, has a more intimate connexion with some other

* Would this be an improvement upon Sir William’s general arrangement of bis Fourth Book; to introduce after the three first Chapters which treat of general matters relating to Crime (namely—the nature of Crimes and Punishments; by whom Crimes may be committed; and the different*degrees of guilt,) the general Code of procedure; since as the arrangement now stand *, exceptions are considered before roles are discussed ?

“ It fortunately happens, to prevent all controversy and elation of mind, that onr predecessors will remain undisturbed in the honour and reverence due to them; whilst we pursue our own designed reap the fruits of our moderation.

PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.

Certain reasons, stated and examined in the following pages, have been declared against the Reduction of the law to Writing; misleading, it is conceived, the judgments of many eminent members of the profession. And did the argument in its favour depend upon any other data than those obtained by intuition only, —was the proposition sought to be established by a balancing of opposite arguments, a comparison of opposite facts and presumptions, —it would; under the circumstances, be in vain to anticipate that unbiassed attention to necessary to its adequate adjustment. Its claims to that attention are rested upon the single circumstance, that it can be proved to demonstration, that the proposition, so to speak, is a question of figures 3 and that it can be proved to demonstration, that the reasons declared against its adoption are founded in misconception.

The verification, however, of these assertions, will be nothing to the disparagement of those eminent persons; since, though the question upon which their opinions were given is a question of jurisprudence, yet it was no part of their duty as lawyers to qualify themselves for its solution. It is no disparagement to a physician that he has misconceived the principle of association, or any other of the laws of mind; since, though appertaining to that being with which his attention is occupied, yet the knowledge of that principle (to assume the fact) is not necessary to

the perfection of the healing art. In like manner, it it no disparagement to a lawyer, that he hat misconceived the principles upon which the jurisprudence of his Country ought to proceed, and upon which, with perfect safety and feasibility, it can proceed j since, though a branch of that science upon which his thoughts are employed, yet an acquaintance with those principles is not at all essential to the discharge of his professional functions. It is no disparagement to assert, that the opinion of a lawyer, what* ever his professional eminence may be, who has not addressed his mind to this particular object, is worth no more than the opinion of any other man.

Should it be objected to the course pursued, that the refutation of living opinions is little likely to advance a cause, however dependent upon that refutation; # it may be replied, that the peculiar circumstances of the present ease render it different to all others of its kind. The avowed purpose of the pending reforms being, to place the jurisprudence of the country in that state which reasoning can demonstrate to be the fittest and most appropriate, is a guarantee against the operation, if not existence, of unworthy feeling.

No less fortunate are the other auspices under which a measure for the Reduction of the Criminal Law to Writing would make its first appearance; in that neither

does the decision of its merits belong to any particular clan of men, nor has it ever yet received a decision. The slow progress of truth, the common complaint of every age, is, amongst others, ascribable to the following very influential causes: 1. To the circumstance of there being a particular clasQ*n society, who are, or are supposed to be, the sole arbiters of a particular question. A body of men are little disposed or qualified to question a system, in the principles of which they have been educated, and when regarded as their peculiar patrimony, view with jealousy the attempts of individuals of their own fraternity, and, with much greater, those of strangers. But the question which such a measure would involve, is not necessarily to be solved by lawyers. The question which peculiarly is the subject of their province is this, —what are the established laws, either expressly promulgated, or to be collected from inference, analogy, or interpretation ? “ Lawyers write,

according to the states where they live, what is received law, and not what ought to be law; for the wisdom of a law-maker is one, and of a lawyer is another.”* The question involved by such a measure would be, —In what form shall those laws be expressed ? 2. The circumstance that the question has, upon former occasions, been debated, and all that is now advanced in its support been answered, is another obstacle to the progress of truth. People, not themselves under the influence of those feelings which induced the former opponents to prolong the error, are disposed to regard their opposition as fair and consci* entious, and in deference to their abilities, or more comprehensive views, and from incapacity to define the very ground of their objection, are apt to distrust their own

judgment. But in reference to the present subject, the question has never yet been brought to a decision.

If, too, it shall ultimately appear, * that all who have advocated the reduction of the law to writing have entirely misconceived the objects which the reduction is destined to attain, —have altogether mistaken the mode in which the reduction is to be accomplished, and, in so doing, have demonstrated the impracticability of attaining the objects which the reduction is destined to secure, — this circumstance will be likewise favourable. Most

* The discussion of this branch of the subject is too long to be entertained in a pamphlet; but the following general observations are subjoined

Those who advocate the Reduction of the Law to Writing, have one of three objects in view :—1. To decide between conflicting opinions, and correct acknowledged imperfections; 9. To preserve the rales which now obtain from any subsequent change; 3. To furnish rules for the decision of future cases.

To what extent they contemplate these object, is to be gathered, not from their declaration upon the subject, but from the model which they recommend for obtaining them. Since, in spite of their declarations to the contrary, men cannot be said to contemplate ends, for the accomplishment of which the means which they recommend are totally inadequate.

Upon, examining the different systems, which have hitherto been advanced, far Reducing the Law to Waiting, it will be found, that the ends which their author* have had in contemplation, are the two first, and the two first only; namely, 1. To decide between conflicting opinions, and correct acknowledged imperfections; 9. To preserve the rules which now obtain from any subsequent change; and not, as in the system now recommended; 3. To furnish rules for the decision of future caaea.

To fix somo certain definite rule, where the authorities are at variance, and to substitute what is right for that which is admitted to be wrong, is, when attainable, a proceeding of which all must approve. But, for this purpose, to advocate the reduction of the entire system to writing, is to propose $ remedy infiuitely too extensive for the evil to be redressed, —to recommend a change not warranted by the reasons assigned for it.

To preserve the rules which now obtain from any subsequent change, can be beneficial only upon three suppositions: 1. That the rules which now obtain are just; 9. That it is probable that the coarts will, at some future period, change them, and thereby substitute for what is right that which is wrong; 3. That even admitting the rules which now obtain to be erroneous, yet it is better lo preserve them for the present and in all future time, .by toking from the courts the discretion which, under the existing system, they have of changing Ibera. Neither of which suppositions, it is conceived, will be allowed.

tiv Reduction to Writing

projects are condemned in the outset5 and people are averse to reconsider, on the same grounds, a subject upon which they have already formed an opinion. But when the propriety of that opinion, upon the grounds on which it proceeded, is acknowledged, and a rehearing of the case demanded, from the fallacy of the former arguments in its favour having kept the real basis on which it rests out of view, the request can hardly be refused.

The intention of the following observations, is to convey a general idea of the proposition submitted, and of the reasons upon which it proceeds; and thereby induce clear perceptions of a subject, upon which so much misconception has prevailed from the want of them. To descend to particulars, would involve such copiousness of detail, and variety of illustration, as altogether to exceed the limits of a pamphlet. These, however, are absolutely essential to decide upon its merits, and will be furnished, should the opportunity be afforded, by the introduction, and subsequent discussion, of the measure proposed.

The laws of Thb laws of England are divisible into the Written dmiibie into Law or Acts of Parliament, and the Unwritten or Common the^fnitten Law. Which phrase “ Common Law ” has two different senses 5 one proper, * the other figurative. In its proper signification, it designates laws not included in the book styled “ The Statutes of the Realm; ” in its figurative sense, we intend those principles of reason which should govern in the absence of positive authority. What those unwritten laws are depends partly upon evidence, partly upon the opinion of the judicial authorities; and what

those principles are, altogether depends upon the opinion of the Judges.

A reform of these laws, written and unwritten, and,

I therefore, of our Criminal Law, may consist, 1. In a Consolidation of the Statutes; 2. In an Amendment of both Statute and Common Law; . In a Reduction of the Common Law to Writing.

1. Statutes are Consolidated, when, by uniting two or more together, we make one serve the purpose'of many. And the advantages of a Consolidation are, first, that it brings under one point of view that which now lies scattered over the face of many volumes. Secondly, it ascertains the reciprocal influence which a variety of statutes, each applicable to the same subject, have upon each other; a knowledge which, under the present state of firings, it is matter of the greatest difficulty, nay, often of impossibility, for the most comprehensive mind to attain. Thirdly, it deteets and reconciles those contradictions and inconsistencies so constantly observable, where a number of statutes have been applied from time to time to the same subject. Fourthly, by reducing the law to a greater certainty, it diminishes litigation; and by exhibiting a dear and connected view of that law, it enables us to observe, and, observing, to supply, those particulars in which it is defective.

2. Laws are Amended9 when the deficiencies discoverable by observation or experience are supplied. By attending to the principle upon which a law proceeds, and observing the deviations from that principle which, in point of fact, have taken place, we are enabled to correct those deviations. And by experiencing, in the practical

Where there is no such written or positive law, the decision of causes is left, in a great measure, to equity and the sense of mankind, -—in other words, to the discretion of the Judge; and it is the first principle of a free government to leave nothing, which we are not obliged to leave, to the discretion of the Magistrates.* 2. Each case is decided, by what appears to the then presiding tribunal to be just. Now, since the notion 9 of what is just is formed from the balancing of opposite advantages and disadvantages, and as either all the items of the list* may not, at the moment, present themselves to the mind, or, should they occur, then as different notions of what is just may be formed by different minds, of a class of particular cases, which, in reason, are alike the

subjects of the same law, the whole or a portion may be subjected to an erroneous law, and some to one law, some to another. 3. Upon each individual occasion, the labour of# balancing opposite advantages and disadvantages must be incurred, and the risk run of some being left out of the account. 4. Upon the occurrence of every new case, the question arises, What will be the opinion of the Court ? A conjecture upon this subject can be formed only by comparing opposite analogies. These analogies are so numerous, and the adjustment of their relative hearings is consequently so intricate a task, that hardly a case occurs in which there are not legal opinions either way. Excessive litigation, therefore, is another consequence of the absence of such positive law; for, if there is no recognised law to govern your case, you must necessarily have recourse to a judicial tribunal. 5. Even where new causes are decided from analogy to previous decisions, yet these decisions, from the natural infirmity of the wisest, are too often wrong, and thus modifications of the original error are endlessly diversified. 6. Without such positive laws, we cannot, with certainty, order our conduct or affair *

II, Assuming that the principles themselves are right, and that it can be shown that they have not been adequately pursued, is U expedient that the deficiency should be supplied?

Principles, in jurisprudence, are those fundamental Two principles maxims which are assumed to be just, and are used by Jurisprudence, the legislator as his guides in the formation of laws, trining6 to*the Now, though the principles of Criminal Jurisprudence j^enJeieet^ axe not one but many, yet the object of the following for disquisition being to recommend the reduction of the law to writing, those principles only which the measure re* commended seeks more effectually to follow up, will be considered at present. Those principles—the most important of all—are, 1, That laws should be as Certain $

2. And as Complete, as human intelligence can make them.

In the consideration of these principles it is proposed to show, 1, That our laws are susceptible of certainty;

2, And of completeness, in a very high degree, 3, That our system of Criminal Jurisprudence is uncertain and incomplete. 4. And then to ascertain, by what means we can give to our Criminal Jurisprudence that degree of certainty and completeness of which it is susceptible.

But as, introductory to these topics, it is necessary that Preliminary we distinctly understand the nature of the reasoning pro- inquiry' cess employed in the solution of questions of jurisprudence.

For as language, for the most part, is entirely metaphorical, founded upon a supposed resemblance between that of which we are speaking, and something to which a term has already been assigned; so, in a great degree, argument

]g Reduction to Writing

is analogous only, being founded upon a supposed analogy, or resemblance between the subject uppn which we qre debating, and some other subject, to which a course of reasoning has already been applied. Accordingly, as in the case of language, so in that of reasoning, error has been the necessary consequence of this mode of proceeding, wherever the supposed resemblance has been imaginary only:and it is mainly to this cause, that a system of jurisprudence has been hitherto supposed susceptible of no radical change, that shall exempt it from the common fate, more or less, of most of the other sciences—uncertainty and incompleteness.

If, therefore, we would reason correctly upon questions of jurisprudence, it is essential that we set out with distinct and accurate notions of the nature as well of that science^ as of every other science to which it may be supposed to bear any analogy, in order to determine, whether the modes of reasoning proper to the one apply to the other, and if inapplicable, that they may thenceforth and for ever be rejected, and the question tried by its own proper and peculiar tests of truth.

SECTION 1.

That the reasoning to be employed for solving .questions in Jurisprudence, is demonstrative reasoning. ‘

Reasoning do- Rbasonino is that process by which we are enabled to

lined, and its, , , " . .

different kinds deduce one truth from another, it is of two kinds, according to the nature of the primary truth, data, or premise, from which the secondary truth, consequence, or conclusion, is deduced. Where the primary truth isimfisof the Criminal Law. Ixi

putable, it is called demonstrative reasoning; where that truth is probable only, it is called probable reasoning.

Truths are indisputable, when their contraries cannot be conceived by the mind. Truths ere probable only, - when their contraries are conceivable. And according to the nature of the primary, will be that of the secondary truth; indisputable, where the primary truth is indisputable; probable, where the primary truth is probable only.

The sciences may be divided into, 1. The Mathematics: The telenets

(the subjects of

2. Physics; 3. Metaphysics; 4. Ethics; 5. Municipal reasoning)dis-Jurisprudence. Hie end of Mathematics is to investigate the^r^different the properties of number and of magnitude. That of de *

Physics, is to investigate the laws which nature has established for the regulation of matter. That of Meta* physics, is to investigate the laws which nature has established for the regulation of mind. That of Ethics, to investigate the laws which nature has established for the regulation of human actions. That of Municipal Jurisprudence, to investigate the laws which human authority has established for the regulation of human actions.

Now, reasonings in all these sciences have this in com* The kind of

reasoQing, ip *

mon, that, in all alike, we set out with certain data, or piicable to premises, which we assume as true, and thence infer certain ^ai science] results, which again are assumed as premises whence to in- a*cerllune<1’ fer other results; and so on, and so on, until the end sought is obtained. But in Mathematics and Jurisprudence only, are these premises or data indisputably true, so that to deny their truth is an absolute and manifest absurdity.

The media through which we obtain our data in Mathematics and Jurisprudence, are altogether different from

Reduction to Writing

those of the other sciences. In the other sciences, our data are obtained by induction—by first collecting, and then generalizing the facts collected5 and not pur primary data, or first principles only, at starting, but all our data in every stage of our reasoning. And as inductions can give us no unerring assurance of any truth, unless, which is impossible, we could be certain that they are entire— that every fact has been collected—that its relation to other facts has been exactly determined—and that nothing has been overlooked in drawing the general conclusion; our premises in these sciences are only probable, and such as these premises are, such must the nature of our conclusions necessarily be—always attended with some portion of uncertainty and hesitation. But in Mathematics and Jurisprudence, the data from which we reason are obtained by intuition, and cannot be otherwise than true. In Mathematics as all are agreed; and though hitherto little, if at all, observed, yet as equally so in Municipal Jurisprudence. For what are the data from which we reason in that science ? Why, the positive rules ordained by an authority, whose decrees cannot be questioned. And whence do we obtain a knowledge of these rules ? Why, by the mere inspection of the documents in which they are recorded and promulgated. Whether these rules or decrees are just or unjust, is a consideration altogether beside the present subject. They themselves are indisputable, and our conclusions, if properly drawn, will partake of the nature of the premises from which they are deduced, and be themselves indisputable likewise.

SECTION 2.

That our Laws are susceptible of Certainty in a very high degree.

A law is certain, when no doubt can arise as to its meaning, and as to its application. Now, doubts as to its meaning must arise, from the imperfection of its language; and doubts as to its application must arise, from the imperfection of the reasoning process employed to establish, that this or that particular cose is, or is not, a subject for its application. If, therefore, it can be shown, that laws may be so expressed as to leave little or no doubt as to their meaning or signification; and that, if properly conducted, no error can creep into the reasoning process to be employed to establish, that this or that particular case is, or is not, a subject for their application; the proposition, that laws are susceptible of certainty in a very high degree, will have been demonstrated.

And that laws may be so expressed, as to leave little or no doubt as to their meaning or signification, will appeal from considering the causes to which imperfections in language are ascribable, and by showing that jurisprudence may be exempted from their influence. These causes, then, are two. 1. Men annex different ideas to the thing about which they are speaking. 2. Men annex different ideas to the words which.they employ in speaking of that thing. And the reason of their difference, as to the thing itself, is, that the way in which alone they acquire their knowledge of it, is experience and observation—in a word, by

Laws may be so expressed as to leave little or no doubt as to their signification.

lx iv

induction; a course always attended with some uncertainty, and which will lead this man to one conclusion, that to another. And the reason of their difference as to the words employed is, that there is no authority which can adjudge, that’such ideas, and none besides, shall be annexed to words. But the reverse of all this is the case with jurisprudence; since here is an authority—the legislature—that can define, with the utmost precision, the exact nature of the thing which is the subject of its provisions f and which can decree, that such and none besides shall be the meaning of the words which it employs.

SECTION 3.

That our Laws are susceptible of Completeness in a very high degree.

complete, must be expressed in the form of a general rule; to be in every degree complete, its terms must be such as to include no cases which ought to be excluded, and to omit no cases which ought to be included; and, therefore, to be complete in a very high degree, its terms must be such as to omit few cases, if any, which ought to be included, and to include few cases, if any, which ought to be omitted.

To this end, two essentials are requisite: 1. An ade- Circumstances

And experience has proved, that, to a very considerable extent, it can be predicted that this essential circumstance will be found in cases of future occurrence; since, in running over the periodical voj - i. e

Reduction to Writing

lxvi

reports of adjudged cases, we shall find, that there are comparatively few for the government of which a general rule might not have been extracted n. priori from cases already reported. To prove this fact by one or two examples, and, at the same time, to show the moltiplicity of litigation which a system of general rules, as opposed to particular decrees, would infallibly prevent, * let us descend to the consideration of individual cases.

In the twenty-sixth year of the reign of King Charles the Second, the Court of King's Bench, in Rex v. Newton, decided this particular case t—A fabrication, to fall within that provision of the fifth of Elizabeth which relates to deeds, must purport to be (that is, bear upon its face the appearance of being) under seal. And why? For this plain reason: the statute of Elizabeth has denounced the fabrication, not of any writing, but (inter Offc») of deeds only; now, to a deed certain legal forms are requisite $ amongst others, a seal; and as the writing. In the particular case then submitted for judgment, wanted h seal, it was not a deed, and, therefore, not within the statute. The general rule which the decision warrants, lies upon the surface, and is simply this. Where a statute denounces the fabrication, not of any writings whatever, but writings of this or that legal denomination only, it is necessary that the fabrication, to come within the statute, should wear upon its face all the legal requisites of genu• Litigation is carried to a greater extent in this country than in any other, whatever ita size.

them, is not within its provisions. Had this simple rule been promulgated by the courts it would have saved the debating of the numerous cases that have followed it, and which, though different in their circumstances, are altogether in unison with its principle; the last of these, as yet reported, * is Pateman's case, in 1821. And, not only would it have done this; it would have prevented the uncertainty that now reigns upon the subject, in consequence of the dicta in the cases of Elliott, Hoost, and Collicott; insomuch, that, up to this day, we have no

a

fixed rule to go by.

Again, and upon a different subject. In the fifteenth year of the reign of King Charles the Second, the Court of King’s Bench, in Rex v. Deakins, decided this particular case.—To fabricate a protection, as from a Parliament man, in the name of one who is not a member, is a forgery. The general rule, which the decision warrants, here also lies upon the surface, and is simply thisA writing is a forgery, in spite of the non-existence of facts essential to its legal validity \ since the circumstance that it is a legal nullity, does not appear upon the face of it, and its operation, therefore, fcs an engine of fraud, (the only thing regarded,) is not by such legal invalidity prevented. Had this simple rule been promulgated by the court, it would have saved the debating of the numerous cases that have followed it, and which, though different in

their circumstances, are altogether in unison with its principle s the last of these, as yet reported, is Froud’s case, in 1819.

SECTION 4.

That our System of Criminal Jurisprudence is Uncertain and Incomplete.

That our system of Criminal Jurisprudence is neither certain nor complete appears from mere inspection; since thereby we find, that neither is the meaning of its terms ascertained, nor are its decrees general rules.

SECTION 5.

Of the means of giving to our Criminal Jurisprudence that degree of Certainty and Completeness of which it is susceptible.

It has been said already, that our system of Criminal Jurisprudence is uncertain, from the imperfection of its language. The remedy for this state of things is, to define the nature of the things which are the subjects of its provisions; and to decree that such, and none besides, shall be the meaning of the words which it employs.

It has been likewise said, that our system of Criminal Jurisprudence is incomplete, from the want of general rules. For our courts of justice, as well as our legislature, rarely promulgate general rules, but content themselves with particular decrees; or, in the common phrase, rarely travel out of the record. Now since no one case exactly .resembles another, and a$ no universal rule, applicable to

of the Criminal Law,

lxix

each variety of circutnstanc^has yet been declared; upon the occurrence of every new case, the question arises, — What will be the opinion of the court ? And as specious arguments can never be wanting upon either side of any question, with the exception of those of quantity and number $ and as no general, and therefore no clear, ideas reign upon the subject, the opinion of the court is more constantly demanded than it otherwise would be. The remedy for this state of things is, to substitute general rules for individual enactments and decisions, and by reducing those rules to writing, to give to them, what no court of justice could give, a binding authority.

Assuming that the principles themselves, upon which our system of Criminal Jurisprudence now proceeds, are right, and that it can be shown that they have not been adequately pursued, is it expedient that the deficiency should be supplied ?

In the first chapter, we selected two of the principles Question for upon which our system of Criminal Jurisprudence now proceeds; namely, —1. That laws should be as certain; ^7^"* 2. And as complete, as human intelligence can make them; and we then showed, that these principles had not toff-been adequately followed up. The question, therefore, to be discussed in the present chapter, is, whether it is’expedient that the deficiency should be supplied ? or, in other words, whether the law shall be reduced to writing ? In the examination of which we shall consider,

1. The Codes hitherto adopted by foreign nations for reducing their laws to writing.

2. The difference between the Codes hitherto adopted by foreign nations, and that now recommended for the reduction of our criminal common law to writing.

3. The fallacy of the reasons hitherto advanced against thi reduction of our law to writing, as applied to the proposed Code.

4. The benefits which the Code now recommended will confer, and the evils which it will redress.

For, as the argument in favour of the Reduction of the Law to Writing, from what has appeared already, is a conclusive argument, it remains only to refute the reasons that have been advanced on the other side; and as these reasons are drawn from an experience of the codes bf foreign nations, it is necessary to ascertain the character and objects of those codes, and by showing that no parallel can be drawn between tfiem and that which is here recommended, refute the objections that may be applied to it.

t The silence or ambiguity of the laws was supplied by the occasional edicti of those magistrates who were invested with the hen >urs of the state. This ancient prerogative of the Roman kings was transferred, in their respective offices, to the consuls and dictators, the censors and prastors, and a similar right was assumed by the tribunes of the people, the ediles, and the proconsuls. At Rome, and in the provinces, the duties of the subject and the intention of the governor were proclaimed; and the civil jurisprudence was .reformed by the annual edicts of the supreme judge, the prastor of the city. As soon as he ascended his tribunal, he announced, by the voice of the crier, and afterwards inscribed on a white wall, the rules which he proposed to follow in the decision of doubtful cases, and the relief which his equity would afford from the precise rigour of ancient statutes. A principle of discretion more congenial to monarchy was introduced into the republic: the art of respecting the name, and eluding the efficacy, of the laws, was improved by successive praetors; Subtleties and fictions were invented, to defeat the plainest meaning of the decemvirs, and, where the end was salutary, the

means were frequently absurd - But the errors or vices of each praetor expired with

his annual office; such maxims alone as had been approved by reason and practice were copied by succeeding judges; the rule of proceeding was defined by the solution of new cases; and the temptations to injustice were removed by the Cornelian law, which compelled the praetor of the year to adhere to the letter and spirit of his first proclamation. It was reserved for the curiosity and learning of Hadrian, to accomplish the design which had been conceived by the genius of Caeaar; and the preetorship of Selvius Julian, an eminent lawyer, was immortalized by the composition of the Perpetual Edict. Thia well'digested code was ratified by the Emperor and the Senate; the long divorce of law and equity, was at length reconciled; and, instead of the twelve tables, the perpetual edict was fixed as the invariable standard of civil jurisprudence.—Gibbon.

And Responsa prudentum.—1: Principum placita, or the Imperial Constitutions, were the decrees of the Emperors themselves.* 2.° Responsa prudentum, or the answers of the sages of the law upon questions submitted to them, came, as it seems, to have a binding authority from an ordinance of Valentinian the third, investing them with that sanction.

• From Augustus to Trajan, the modern Caesars were content to promulgate their edicts in the various characters of a Roman magistrate; and, in the decrees of the senate, the epistles and orations of the prince were respectfully inserted. Hadrian appears to hare been the first who assumed, without disguise, the plenitude of legislative power; and this innovation, to agreeable to his active mind, was countenanced by the patience of the times, and hia long absence from the seat of government. The same policy was embraced by succeeding monarebs, and, according to the harsh metaphor of Tertul-lian, “ the gloomy and intricate forest of ancient laws was cleared away by the axe of the royal mandates and constitutionsDuring four centuries, from Hadrian to Justinian, the public sad private jurisprudence was moulded by the will of the sovereign; and few institutions, either human or divine, were permitted to stand on their former basis . Yet in the rescripts, replies to the consultations of the magistrates, the wisest of princes might be deceived by a partial exposition of the cose. And this abuse, which placed their hasty decisions on the some level with mature and deliberate acts of legislation, was ineffectually condemned by the sense and example of Trajan. The rescripts of the emperor, his grants and decrees, his edicts and pragmatic sanctions, were subscribed in purple ink, and transmitted to the provinces as general or special laws, which the magistrates were bound to execute, and the people to obey. But as their number continually multiplied, the rule of obedience became each day more doubtful and obscure, till the will of the sovereign was fixed and ascertained in the Gregorian, the Hermoge-man, and the Tbeodosi&n Codes.—Gibbon,

The compilation of Justinian consists of three parts:—

1. The Institutes; 2. The Digest, or Pandects]:; 3. The Code, 1, The Institutes are a summary view of the Roman law; an elementary book, compiled for the use of students, as an introduction to the study of that law.

2. The Digest, or Pandects, are a methodical collection of all former laws and opinions, —3, The Code, of all former constitutions, —which it was deemed expedient to retain and adopt.§ 4. To which, after the death of Justinian,

* The president Henault, in his history, observes, —*The oode of laws compiled by order of Theodosius the younger, towards the year 435, and introduced by the Romans into France, Was lost towards the end of the second race! The Code published by Jua* tinian in 529, end to which wo had been entire strangers, was (bund [in point of (net, it never was lost] in Apulia, towards the year U37, and brought to France, where it is become our written law. The Benedictine fathers, in their literary history of France, pretend that this event happened at least a century later. Cujaa has sinoe restored the Theodosian Code; but at present it is used only for consulting.

t The two first, of which some fragments have escaped, were framed by two private 'lawyers, to preserve the constitutions of the Pagan Emperorsfrom Hadrian to Constantine. The third, which is still extant, was digested in sixteen books, by the order of the younger Theodosius, to consecrate the laws of the Christian princes from Constantine to his own reign. But the three codes obtained an equal authority inXhe tribunals; and any act which was not Included ifi the sacred deposit, might be regarded by the Judge as spurious or obsolete.

Cojacius assigned to Gregory the reigns from Hadrian to G&llienus, and the continuation to his fellow-labourer, Hermogenes. This general division may be just; hut they often trespassed on each other's ground.—Gibbon.

§ In the first year of his reign, Justinian directed the faithful Tribonian, and nine learned associates, to revise the ordinances of his predecessors, as they were contained, since the time of Hadrian, in the Gregorian, Hermogenian, and Theodosian codes; to purge the errors and contradictions, to retrench whatever wag obsolete or superfluous, and to select the wise and salutary laws best adapted to the practice of the tribunals, and the use of his subjects. The work was accomplished in fourteen months; and die twelve books, or tables, which the new decemvirs produced, might be designed to imihartr

tote the labours of their Roman predecessors. The new Cods of Justinian was honoured with his name, and confirmed by his royal signature i authentic transcripts were, multiplied by the pens of notaries and scribes; they were transmitted to the magic *, trstes of the European, the Asiatic, and afterwards the African provinces; and the law of the empire was proclaimed, on solemn festivals, at the doors of churches. A more, arduous operation was still behind—to extract the spirit of jurisprudence from the decisions and conjectures, the questions and disputes, of the Roman civilians. Seventeen lawyers, with Tribonian at their head, were appointed by the emperor to exercise an absolute jurisdiction over the works of their predecessors. If they had obeyed his command in ten years, Justinian would have been satisfied with their diligence; and the rapid composition of the Diosst, or Pan users, in three years, will deserve praise or censure, according to the merit of the execution. From the library of Tribonian they chose forty, the most eminent civilians of former times: two thousand treatises were comprised in an abridgment of fifty books; and it haa been oarefully recorded, that three millions of lines, or sentences, were reduced, in this abstract, to the moderate somber of one hundred and fifty thousand. The edition of this great work was delayed a month after that of the Institutes; and it seemed reasonable that the elements should precede the digest of the Roman low. As soon as the emperor had approved their labours, he ratified, *by his legislative power, the speculations of these private citizens: their Commentaries on the twelve tables, the perpetual edict, the laws of the people, end the decrees of the senate, tuemded t* the authority of 4h$ tut; and* the text was abandoned aa an useless, though venerable, relic of antiquity. The Cods, the Psmtes, and the Institute^ were deelared to be the legitimate system of civil jurisptvh ilence; they alone were admitted in the tribunals, and they alone were taught in the academies of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus. Justinian addressed to the senate and provinces his eternal oreclm, and his pride, under the mask of piety, ascribed the consummation of this great design to the support and inspiration of the Deity.

Since the emperor declined the fame and envy of original composition, we can only require at his hands method, choice, and fidelity—the humble, though indispon *

(sable, virtues of a compiler. Among the various combinations of ideas, it is difficult to assign any reasonable preference; but as the order of Justinian is different in his three works, it is possible that all may be wrong; end it is certain that two cannot be right. In the selection of ancient laws, he seems to have viewed his predecessors without jealousy, and with equal regard: the aeries could not ascend above the reign of Ha* dxian, and the narrow distinction of Paganism and Christianity, introduced by the superstition of Theodosius, had been abolished by the consent of mankind. But the jurisprudence of the Pandects is circumscribed within a period of a hundred yews, —* from the perpetual edict to the death of Severn* Alexander; the civilians, who lived under the first Csesars, are seldom permitted to speak, and only three names con be attributed to the age of the republic. The favourite of Justinian (it has been fiercely urged) was fearful of encountering the light of freedom, and the gravity of Roman sages. Tribonian condemned to oblivion the genuine and native wisdom of Cato, the Scaevolas, and Sulpieius; while he invoked spirits more congenial to his own—the Syrians, Greeks, and Africans, who flocked to the imperial court to study Latin, as a

foreign tongue, and jurisprudence, as a lucrative profession. But the ministers of Justinian were instructed to labour, not for the curiosity of antiquarians, but for the immediate benefit of his subjects. It was their duty to select the useful and practical parts of the Homan law; and the writings of the old republicans, however curious or excellent, were no longer suited to the new system of manners, religion, and government. Perhaps, if the preceptors and friends of Cicero were still alive, our candour would acknowledge, that, except in purity of language, their intrinsic merit was excelled by the school of Papinian and Ulpian. The science of the laws is the sole gTowth of time and experience; and the advantage both of method and materials, is naturally assumed by the most recent authors. The civilians of the reign of the Antonines had studied the works of their predecessors; their philosophic spirit had mitigated the rigour of antiquity, simplified the forms of proceeding, and emerged from the jealousy and prejudice of the rival sects. The choice of the authorities that compose the Pandects, depended on the judgment of Tribonian; but the power of his sovereign could not absolve him from the sacred obligations of truth and fidelity. As the legislator of the empire, Justinian might repeal the acts of the Antonines, or condemn, as seditious, the free principles which were maintained by the last of the Roman lawyers. But the existence of past facts is placed beyond the reach of despotism; and the emperor was guilty of fraud and forgery, when he corrupted Ike integrity of their text, inscribed with their venerable names the words and ideas of his servile reign, and suppressed, by the hand of power, the pure and authentic copies of their sentiments. The changes and interpolations of Tribonian and his colleagues, are excused by the pretence of uniformity; but their cares had been insufficient, and the antinomes, or contradictions, of the Code and Pandects, still exercise the patience and subtlety of modern civilians.

A rumour, devoid of evidence, has been propagated by the enemies of Justinian, — that the jurisprudence of ancient Rome was reduced to ashes by the author of the Pandects* from the vain persuasion, that it was now either false or superfluous. Without usurping an office so invidious, the emperor might safely commit to ignorance and time, the accomplishment of this destructive wish. Before the invention of printing and paper, the labour end the materials of writing could be purchased only by the rich; and it may reasonably be computed, that the price of books was a hundredfold their present value. Copies Were slowly multiplied, and cautiously renewed:the hope of profit tempted the sacrilegious scribes to erase the characters of antiquity, and Sophocles or Tacitus were obliged to resign the parchment to missals, homilies, and the golden legend. If such was the fate of the most beautiful compositions of genius, what stability could be expected for thie dull and barren works of on obsolete science ? The books of jurisprudence were interesting to few, and entertaining to none; their value was connected with present use, and they sunk for ever, as soon os that use was superseded by the innovations of fashion, superior merit, or public authority. In the age of peace and learning, between Cicero and the last of the Antonines, many losses had been already sustained, and some luminaries of the school, or forum, were known only to the carious by tradition and report. Three hundred and sixty years of disorder and decay accelerated the progress of oblivion; and it may fairly he presumed *, that of the

writings which Justinian is accused of neglecting, many were no longer to be found in the libraries of the East. The copies of Papinian, or Ulpian, which the reformer had prescribed, were deemed unworthy of future notice; the twelve tables, and praetorian edict, insensibly vanished; and the monuments of ancient Home were neglected or destroyed by the envy and ignorance of the Greeks. Even the Pandects themselves have escaped with difficulty and danger from the common shipwreck; and criticism has pronounced, that all the editions and manuscripts of the West, are derived from one original. It was transcribed at Constantinople in the beginning of the 7th century, was successively transported, by the accidents of war and commerce, to Amalphi, Pisa, and Florence, and is now deposited, os a sacred relic, in the ancient palace of the republic.

It is the first care of a reformer to prevent any future reformation. To maintain the text of the Pandects, the Institutes, and the Code, the use of cyphers and abbreviations was rigorously proscribed; and as Justinian recollected that the perpetual edict had been buried under the weight of commentators, he denounced the punishment of forgery against the rash civilians who should presume to interpret or pervert the will of their sovereign. The scholars of Accursius, of Bartolus, of Cujacius, should blush for their accumulated guilt, unless they dare to dispute his right of binding the authority of his successors, and the native freedom of the mind. But the emperor was unable to fix his own inconstancy; and, while he boasted of renewing the exchange of Diomede, of transmuting brass into gold, he discovered the necessity of purifying his gold' from the mixture of baser alloy. Six years had not elapsed, from the publication of the Code, before he condemned the imperfect attempt, by a new and more accurate edition of the same work, which he enriched with 200 of his own laws, and 50 decisions of the darkest and most intricate points of jurisprudence. Every year, or, according to Procopius, each day, of his long reign, was marked by some legal innovation. Many of his acts were rescinded by himself; many were rejected by his successors; many have been obliterated by time; but the number of 16 Edicts, and 168 NoctU, has been admitted into the authentic body of the civil jurisprudence.—Gibbon.

• This celebrated code was not the sole production of the authorities of the empire, but was the result of alterations prescribed by the National Assembly. This body, in 1791, ordered a code of civil laws to be drawn up, which should be common to the whole kingdom. The Convention continued the project; and Cambaceres, the late •rcbebancellor of France, had the courage to undertake the task. The constitution of the year 3, restoring a degree of calm to the distracted state, Cambaceres bad the courage to present a project, on the 24th Prairial, year 4; but on the ballot Tor renewing a part of the Council of Five Hundred, the lot to retire having fallen upon him among others, this plan fell to the ground, and the newly-projected legislation lay dor* mant for three years. The time, - however, was now approaching when his labours and perseverance were to be crowned with success.

That the Code Now the object of the Code Napoleon is the first and for^iu°obj«ct the first only. The different provinces of France had ends only!11*6 hitherto been governed by different laws; and to obviate the inconveniences resulting from this state of things, was the intention of the Code.* Considered in this relanew code of jurisprudence was instantly resumed. Tronchet, Bigot, Preameneu, Male vi lie, and Portalie, were commissioned to draw up a plan, and discuss the basis, of

* a civil legislation, following, at the same time, the order of the different projects presented by Cambaoeres, for the purpose of its being laid before the nation. The commission was appointed on the 24th Thermidor, year 8; and on the 26th Ventose, year 9, the plan was printed.

Befoce offering it for discussion to the Council of State, it was submitted to the whole empire, through the medium of the press; and, by this means, the general and individual observations of France were collected upon every head. The Council of Cassation was also particularly consulted. Sufficient time having been allowed for this purpose, the plans of the Council of State were first discussed in its various sections, the Section of Legislation sitting upon the civil code.

From this body it passed to the Tribunate: here it was soon found impossible to get through it, if each article were the subject of general debate; the Tribunate therefore divided itself, like the Council of State, into sections or committees; and, if objections occurred to any part as it came before them, a conference was had, before either Cambcceres himself, or the Consul de Bruo, between the teetion of the Tribunate and the section of the Council of State, to which this branch of legislation had been committed. Having been approved by both these bodies, it was referred to the Legislative in titles, each decreed separately, and afterwards separately promulgated* Supplementary articles might be added, but no essential alteration was to take pleoe until it had been ten years tried; the advantages, the disadvantages, and the national opinions concerning it, would then, it was thought, he known; in the mean time, the Tribunal of Cassation rectified any material errors and wanderings of the inferior tribunals.— London Encyclopedia•

when their terms are such as to include no cases which ought to be excluded, and to omit no cases which ought to be included; to which end they must be general rules, so framed as to point out that essential circumstance which forms the link of union between particular cases. A perusal of any portion of the Code Napoleon will show, that it does neither the one nor the other. And, therefore, in the terms already employed—viewed as an attempt to render the law, which it imposes, certain and complete, it is the most imperfect production that the world ever saw.

SECTION 2;

Of the difference between the Codes hitherto adopted by Foreign Nations, and that now recommended for the Reduction of our Criminal Common Law to Writing.

It has appeared already, that a written Code may have for its object one of two things. 1. To substitute a different law for that which governed before. 2. To retain the existing law, and merely bring it the nearer to perfection. It has appeared, likewise, that the first is the object of the Codes which have hitherto been adopted by foreign nations, and that the second is the sole object of that in contemplation. It follows, therefore, that the Codes hitherto adopted by foreign nations, and that now recommended for the reduction of our criminal common law to writing, are altogether dissimilar.

That the proposition for reducing our criminal common law to writing has for its object a different end to that of the Code Napoleon, and is therefore altogether dissimilar.

General objection to any alteration.

SECTION 3.

Of the fallacy of the Reasons hitherto advanced against the Reduction of our Law to Writing, as applied to the proposed Code.

The reasons hitherto advanced against the reduction of the law to writing, are three; one general, two specific.

1. Since laws, both civil and criminal, are means prescribed for the attainment of certain ends, it follows that every law is divisible into-vl*0 The end sought to be attained 5 2.° The means prescribed for attaining that end; of which the first may be called the matter of the law, the second its form.

It follows, further, that every change or alteration of a law, may consist in the substitution, in whole or in part, of some other end, or of some other means, for those which obtained before; or, in other words, the alteration may be either in the matter or in the form *

The prejudice which exists against any alteration in the jurisprudence of this country, is a general indiscriminating prejudice, applicable as well to the form as to the substance of our laws; and the foundation upon which it rests is, that it is impossible to foresee what will be the effects of change, and therefore to know that the benefit which it confers will outweigh the inconveniences which it may produce.

This prejudice is extremely salutary in its effects, so far

as respects the substance, or material parts of our jurisprudence:they have given birth to a variety of relations, all of which would be more or less affected by any alteration of the parent system: “ for institutions exercise on each other a very important influence without intending, and almost without knowing that they do so.” But so far as respects the Forms of our laws, it is a prejudice, et pneterea nihil. The argument against disturbing existing relations, can have no application to the measure proposed, since the alteration here is purely Formal, merely substituting one mode of promulgating laws for another. And nothing, therefore, can be more unphilo-sophical than to confound the two, by applying indiscriminately that principle which is applicable only to the substance of jurisprudence.!

* Omnes artes qu ad humanitatem pertinent, liabent quoddam commune vinculum St quasi cognations qu&dam inter se continents. Cic. pro Arch. Poet.; Id. de Orat. 1.8, f Notwithstanding, however, the plainness of this distinction, it seems to have bean entirely overlooked. In the controversy to which Mr. Humphrey’s able work on real property gave rise, the arguments of his opponents take for granted, that, Where laws are rednced to writing, a different law is necessarily substituted for that which governed before, and thettee argue (and very logically) that as alterations in the institutions of a country should be made with great caution, and with a very sparing hand, and ae a redaction of our common law to writing would be a substitution of other and different laws for those which governed before, therefore it cannot be endured. “ In regard, ” says his most distinguished opponent, " to the proposed Code generally, I most avow myself decidedly opposed to all Codes. The laws owe much to the reverence which their antiquity inspires; and where, as in our case, they have, in a succession of ages, been adapted to the free institutions of the country, it were rash, as the Code proposes, to abolish them all by one declaration, and establish anew law.” The objection may or may sot be perfectly just, when applied to the particular Code which Mr. Sugden is examining, but is altogether inapplicable to that which it is our present purpose to recommend; since, so far from proposing “ to abolish all the free institutions of the country by. one declaration, and establish a new law, ” its first and great principle is to retain the existing law, and merely bring it the nearer to perfection.

And not only does the Code now recommended differ in substance from that of Mr. Humphreys, in that whilst the latter substitutes other laws in lieu of those by which we have hitherto been governed, the former retains the present system of jurisprudence, and merely -renders it, upon its own principles, more certain and complete; it differs from it in its farm. The title of Mr. Humphrey’s book is, “ Observations on tire Actual

Reduction to Writing

he 2. The first argument specifically advanced against the

from the ex- codification or reduction of our laws to writing, may be

State of the English Laws of Real Property, with the outlines of a Code.” The Code Napoleon is the model which that gentleman has fixed upon for the one he proposes; whilst for the Code now recommended, that model, for the reasons hereafter given, has been rejected. I am not making these remarks in the spirit of criticism; the display of which would be as uncalled for as it would, on my part, be indecorous: but when others, in directing their batteries against this gentleman's system, seek to involve me in the name common fire, the necessity of separating the two systems, and showing that mine must be tried upon its own peculiar grounds, becomes indispensable.

But though it is neither necessary, nor my inclination, to enter into the abovementioned controversy, 1 may be allowed to make a remark or two upon the following passage in Mr. Sugden's letter. “ The reply dwells with great satisfaction on Mr. Hammond’s statement, that Owing to the quantity of materials to which our unwritten system has given birth, we are, beyond any other nation, in possession of means for framing a written Code. General rules never can be laid down accurately at first. Experience only can point out their proper qualifications, limitations, exceptions, and relative bearings. This experience we possess in the volomes of judicial controversies to which the unwritten system has given birth.' But you can hardly be aware of Mr. Hammond's sentiments on this subject. If I mistake not, you and that gentleman would differ toto ecdo in the proposed work. You would form a new tytlem, depending upon general rules, which, although they can never be laid down accurately at first, ' you would comprise in some fifty pages of letter-press, whilst he would, in many a folio volume, digest the old system, and from it extract his rules. The nature of the task, as Mr. Hammond would exeoate it, may at once be collected from the digest already published of the criminal law, which, of course, he would not rank higher than any other treatise on the same subject written by any other intelligent lawyer. But the criminal law may, for obvious reasons, be safely remodelled by Parliament, whenever it may be thought expedient to take that step.”

Now, upon the observation—“ The nature of the task, as Mr* Hammond would execute it, may at once be collected from the-digest already published of the criminal law* which, of courae, he would not rank higher than any other treatise on the same subject written by mj other intelligent lawyer:”—after expressing my serious doubts that any attch information can be so collected, and the propriety of which doubts will appear when the occasion offers far entering into the details of the measure, I beg to observe, that the comparison cannot be instituted, for there is no work Of the same description extant in the profession. The perfection of science lies in referring particular facta to general principles, and these again to principles of a still more general nature. A digest, therefore, to be perfect, should consist of conclusions of the most general nature, drawn from wide observations of particular coses. And this course, beyond doubt, every considerable writer would be willing to follow, were he at liberty to pursue the bent of his natural genius end inclination. But it unfortunately happens, to the iufiuite prejudice of legal works, that the writer designs, not so much what die dignity of liia subject requires of him, or the general taste of those he would most wish for his judges approves, as whot the practitioner demands. For legal works are written to be read by lawyers; now, the practice of the law is conversant about particular facts, which, again.

of the Criminal Law.

stated thus: The end which the Code proposes to attain perience of ., , , . _, . ., other Codes,

is, that by reducing the law to writing you reduce it to a

certainty and completeness, and thereby cut off in many cases, and diminish in all, the sources of litigation. But experience has fully established, that so far from diminishing litigation, a written Code is emphatically the parent of uncertainty and doubt. The controversies, commentaries, and discussions, to which the Code Napoleon has given birth, already form a considerable library.

But it haVing been shown that between the Code Napoleon, and that which it is proposed to establish, there is no sort of analogy, the argument falls to the ground. The Code Napoleon has been a plentiful source of litigation, 1. From its not having so framed its general rules as to include no cases which ought to be excluded, and to omit no cases which ought to be included; 2. And from not having defined the meaning of its terms. That in

are regulated, not by an abstract rule of right, but by the positive authority of decided cases, or the more positive authority of Acts of Parliament; and the consequence is, that no men are less addicted, and have leas taste for generalisation, than practising lawyers. Hence a writer, to be successful, is compelled to avoid abstraction and generalisation. Moreover, to a practitioner, it is immaterial to know by what steps the system attained its present form. Historical disquisitions, therefore, in legal writings, are regarded as impertinent intruders. And equally unimportant to him is it to be certified whether that system be right or wrong; since, however erroneous, stare decisis is the maxim. Critical dissertations, therefore, are regarded in a similar light. For these reasons it has come to pass, that there is nothing extant which fully and sufficiently makes us acquainted with the principles of that system we are about to reform; and to supply this deficiency, and as a branch of the proposition for reducing the law to writing, the digest, to which allusion was made, baa been, with infinite pains, prepared.

As to estimating myself the merits of my own performance, I, of course, should be the last person so to do, or even to adduce any testimonies'of others of which I may happen to be in possession. But should any gentleman think it worth his while to examine its merits, he will, of course, deem it a sins qua non to make himself thoroughly moster of the ffiode in which it is proposed to reduce the law to writing *, (a task perhaps impossible, until the details are exhibited, and those principles ascertained upon which the general rules have been constructed,) and then view my performance as a mean to that end.

lxxxvi

Of the objection that a reduction of the law to writing will place it in an unsettled state.

Reduction to Writing

contemplation, 1. Promulgates the law in the shape of general rules, so framed as to accomplish those objects; 2. And, by defining the meaning of those rules, interprets them.

3. Should it be objected, that, by reducing the law to writing, you place it in an unsettled state; —the objection can apply to those Codes only which substitute a new law for that which governed before. Laws are in an unsettled state, when it is not settled, 1. What the meaning of their language is; 2. To what cases they apply. And a system, therefore, which, like that in contemplation, avails itself of those assistances that daily observation and experience afford, to render laws more certain and complete, so far from unsettling those laws, emphatically does the reverse.

SECTION 4.

Of the Benefits which the Code now recommended will confer, and the Evils which it will redress.

Thb nature of these has been sufficiently explained already.

SECTION 5.

Concluding Observations.

Such, then, are the general outlines of the Plan for the Reduction to Writing of the Criminal Law of England. A measure which, however important in itself, as unquestionably it is, is chiefly to be prized as the parent of the Codification of our Civil Jurisprudence. For every thing advanced in favour of the one, has an equal application

of the Criminal Law.

lxxxvii

to the other; and, as the great guide and director of our daily concerns, the path which the civil law is destined to point out, should be rendered as lucid and unavoidable as human intelligence can make it* And though no system of jurisprudence will ever reach a state entirely perfect, yet the experience, observation, and reflexion of every succeeding year, will advance it the nearer to that point. It may be a sufficient incitement to human endeavours, that the system now recommended, if its principles are admitted to be just, will, in its very outset, far surpass any that has ever yet been established in society j without pretending to bestow upon any work of man that perfection which Nature seems to have refused to her own productions.

[Bv 42 Ed. III. c. 10, entitled Children horn beyond Sea if inheritable in England, upon the Petition in Parliament by the Commonalty, praying that the Children born beyond Sea in the seigniories of Calais, Guyne, and Gascony, and elsewhere in the lands and seigniories of the Lord the King, shall be hereafter as heretofore inheritable of their heritages in England as other Children born in England, it was enacted and asserted, that the Common Law and the Statute (25 Ed. III. st. 2, which see infra) heretofore made upon this point, shall be observed and kept.

By Statutes It. II. i. 3, T R. II. c. 12, 1 Hen. V. c. 7, Aliens were prohibited to take benefices without the King's licence.

By 1 Ric. 1111 c. 9, entitled In what sort Italian Merchants may sell Merchandises—Several Restraints of Aliens, Provisions are contained to the following effect:—Italian Merchants shall sell their Merchandises in gross and employ their money in the commodities of this realm— Strangers shall sell their Wares within eight months after their arrival, and employ their money as above—Strangers may carry away so much as they cannot sell within eight months—Strangers may remove their goods from one port to another—a Stranger shall not be a host of a stranger unless he be of his own country—Aliens shall not buy and sell Wool or Woollen Cloth within this realm, nor make Woollen Cloth, nor deliver Wool to that end—an Alien shall not be an Handicraftsman— Aliens shall make no Cloth within this realm—Aliens shall sgll their Wares in gross, and not by Fetail—Aliens shall take no Servant but the King's subject—who shall* have forfeitures under the Act—the Act not to prevent Aliens from selling Books, written or printed, or inhabiting within the realm for that intent, —which Proviso is repealed by 25 Hen.

Of Aliens, Denizens, and Naturalization. [Part 1.

By 14 & 15 Hen. VIII. c. 2, entitled What Apprentices strange Artificers shalltake, it is enacted, that no Stranger shall take an Apprentice, but one that was bom under the King’s dbeisance, upon pain of forfeiting Ten pounds—that no Alien shall take above two Journeymen, except they be Dorn under the King’s obeisance (made perpetual by 21 lien. VIII, c. 16. a. 8, and explained by 22 Hen. VIII. c. 13.) A great many Provisions are inserted for regulating the Wares of Aliens. There is a Proviso, that the Act shall not extend to Strangers in the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or within the Sanctuary of Saint Martin’s the Grand; and ulso a Proviso, that it should be lawful for any Lord of Parliament, and others the King’s subjects, having lands of the yearly value of one hun-hundred pounds, to retain Strangers, Joiners and Glaziers, in their service. This Act was made perpetual by 21 Hen. VIII. c. 16, 22 Hen. VIII. c. 13, but altered and amended by 32 Hen. VIII. c. 16.

The next Statute connected with the subject is 21 Hen. VIII. c. 16, u Touching Artificers, Strangers, what they may do as concerning retaining Apprentices, Journeymen, ” &c. by which it is provided, amongst other things, that no Stranger, Artificer, shall keep in his house above two Strangers bom—(which is repealed by Stat. 5 Ehz. c. 4.)—that Aliens housekeepers shall bear such charges as the King’s subjects do—that Aliens shall be sworn to be true to the King, to obey him and his laws—that Aliens shall not assemble in conveRtkSes, butin their halls—that no Alien, dwelling in Oxford, Cambridge, or Saint Martin’s le Grand, shall have above ten persons, Aliens, in his house—(altered and amended by 32 Hen. VIII. c. 16, and see 5 Eliz. c. 4.)—and a Decree of the Star Chamber, containing a preamble respecting the mischiefs arising from the continual resort of Strangers, to the detriment of our own natural subjects, followed by several particular regulations, amongst others, that no Strangers but Denizens shall keep House or Shop, is ratified and confirmed.

The 22 Hen. VIII. c.13, was passed for Bakers, Brewers, Surgeons and Scriveners, not to be accounted Handicraftsmen within the laws prohibiting Aliens from exercising handicrafts.

By the Stat. 32 Hen. VIII. c. 16, Concerning Strangers, — the King calling unto his blessed remembrance the infinite number of Strangers and Aliens which daily do increase and multiply within his Grace's realms and dominions, in excessive numbers, to the great detriment hindrance loss and impoverishment of his Grace’s natural and liege Subjects, and noticing the former Statutes upon the subject, (1 R. III. c. 9. 14 & 15 H. VIII. c. 2, 21II. VIII. c. 16,) which have been frustrated chiefly by means of Letters Patent, obtained by the crafty suits inventions and practices of Strangers, lately made Denizens, which contain that every such Denizen shall be as free as Englishmen naturally born within the King’s Grace’s dominions and obeisance, any Acts or Statutes to the contrary notwithstanding, —it is enacted, that all Denizens shall be bound and obedient by and unto all the aforesaid Acts and Statutes, and to all the contents of the same, and to all other Acts and Statutes of this realm heretofore made, now being in their force and not repealed, any Letters Patent or Ordinances heretofore made, or hereafter to be made, to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding; and that also in all and every Letters Patent for the making of any Denizen, to be made to any Stranger not being born under the King’s Grace’s dbeisance, shall be contained a Proviso, that he or they, to whom such Letters Patent shall be granted, shall be bound and obedient by and unto all the Acts and Estatutes of this Tealm as is aforesaid, and to all and every the contents of the same, except it shall be the King’s most gracious pleasure to grant to any such Alien any special liberties or privileges more or otherwise than is contained in the said Estatutes; and in that case all such liberties and privileges so to be granted to any such Alien, contrary to the form of any of the said Estatutes, shall he plainly wholly and particularly expressed specified and declared by special words, as well in the Bill assigned with the King’s Grace’s hand for obtaining of any such Grant, as in the Letters Patent, to be made out of the Chancery, for and concerning the same. Ip the same Act are

contained Provisions, that no Alien dwelling in Oxford, Ac.c. shall keep above two Servants, that are Strangers, at one time—that every Alien shall be bound by and unto the Law* and Statutes of this realm, and to all and singular the contents of the same—that no Person may keep above two Strangers at one time, except Lords of Parliament, who may keep six—and lastly; it is enacted by Sec. 13, that all Leases of any Dwelling-house or Shop, within this realm or any of the King's dominions, made to any Stranger, Artificer, or Handicraftsman, bom out of the King’s obeisance, not being Denizen, from and after the Feast of Saint Michael the Archangel next ensuing, shall be void and of none effect; and that no Stranger, Artificer, or Handicraftsman, bom out of the King’s obeisance, not being Denizen, shall, after the same Feast take any Lease of any Dwelling-house or Shop within this realm or in any other the King’s dominions, upon pain to lose and forfeit, for every time doing contrary to this Act, one hundred shillings; and that no persons after the same Feast shall grant or let to farm any Dwelling-house or Shop, to any such Stranger Artificer or Handicraftsman, not being Denizen, to the intent to dwell or inhabit in the same, upon like pain m one hundred shillings, the one moiety of which pains and forfeitures to ~ be to the King our Sovereign Lord, and the other moiety to such as wifi sue for the same.

As the above Provisions are not now of any practical importance, it was thought preferrible to refer to them by way of Note, ratner than to insert them in the body of the Collection.

There are several Regulations in the Statute Book respecting the payment of additional Duties by Aliens, but I apprehend that these nave become obsolete since the passing the Statute 27 Geo. III. c. 13, for Consolidating the Duties on the Customs, by which all former Duties are repealed, and in this and the subsequent Acts upon the subject for regulating the amount of Duties, no distinction is made with respect to Aliens.

By 6th Ann, c. 37, For the Encouragement of the Trade to America. Sec. 90, Provision was made for naturalizing toreigu Seamen, who should serve on board any of her Majesty’s ships of war, or any Privateer or Merchant ship] belonging to any of her Majesty's subjects, during the then present war, according to the Provisions of the Act.

By 13th Geo. II. c. 3, For the better Supply of Marinen and Seamen, to serve in hit Majesty’s Shins of War, and on board Merchant Ships and other Trading Skips and Privateers, permission is given to employ a greater proportion of foreign Seamen than is allowed by Stat. 19 Chas. II. and by Sec. 2, it is enacted, that for encouraging foreign Mariners and Seamen to come and serve on board ships belonging to Great Britain, every such foreign Seamen or Mariner, who shall have lawfully served during the time of war on board any of his Majesty’s ships of war, or any Merchant or other Trading ship or vessel, or Privateer, which at the time of such service shall belong to any of his Majesty’s subjects in Great Britain, shall be deemed and taken to be & natural-born Subject of his Majesty’s kingdom of Great Britain, and have and enjoy all the privileges powers rights and capacities which such foreign Mariner or Seamen would have had and enjoyed in case he had been a natural-born Subject of his Majesty, and actually a native within the kingdom of Great Britain, subject to the restrictions mentioned in Stat.

19 & 13 W. III. c. 9. Section 3 provides, that no persons naturalized thereby shall be enabled to be of the Privy Council, or a Member of either House of Parliament, or to take any Office or place of Trust, civil or military, or to have any grant of Lands from the Crown to himself, or any other person in trust tor him—and by Section it shall be law-fill for his Majesty, in any future war, to publish a Proclamation to permit Ships to be maimed with foreign Mariners, in the manner provided by the Act; and upon the publishing such Proclamation, the Act and every thing therein contained shall be deemed in full force and virtue during such war—and by 20 Geo. III. c. 20. For the better Supply

a doubt whether Seamen who had served during the then present Hostilities should be deemed natural Subjects by virtue of the Act of' IS Geo. II. it is declared, that that Act and every thing therein contained is and has continued to be in full force.

By 22 Geo. II. c. 45, For the further Encouragement and Enlargement of the Whale Fishery, and for continuing such Laws as are therein mentioned relating thereto, and for the Naturalization of such foreign Protestants as shall serve, for the Time therein mentioned, on board such Ships as shall he fitted out for the said Fishery, certain Provisions are made for the purpose last mentioned, which, on account of the limited nature of the subject, it is not thought material to notice.

Previous to the commencement of the war of the French Revolution, an Act was passed, 33 Geo. III. c. 4, For establishing Regulations respecting Aliens arriving in this Kingdom, or resident therein in certain Cases, which was continued from time to time during the war. Upon the termination of the war, the Statute 42 Geo. III. c. 92 was passed.

For rcjtctding several Acts for establishing Regulations respecting Aliens arriving in this Kingdom, or residing therein in certain Cases, and for sult-stituting other Provisions in lieu thereof Upon the recommencement of hostilities, the Statute 43 Geo. III. c. 155 was passed, To repeal an Act passed in the last Session of Parliament, Jbr establishing Regulations respecting Aliens at'riving in this Kingdom, or resident therein, and for establishing, until Three Months after the Ratification of a Definitive Treaty of Peace, Regulations respecting Aliens arriving in this Kingdom, or resident therein; and upon conclusion of the late peace, the Statute 54 Geo. III. c. 155, was passed, To repeal an Act for establishing Regulations respecting Aliens arriving in or resident in this Kingdom in certain Cases, and for substituting other Provisions, until the End of the next Session of Parliament, in lieu thereof. See farther, infra.

By the Irish Statute, 14 & 15 Chas. II. c 13, foreign Traders, Manufacturers, Mariners, &c. being Protestants, who should within seven years transport themselves with their Stock to Ireland, are naturalized, taking the Oaths.

These Provisions are continued with some variation, and are rendered more comprehensive, extending to all persons except Jews, sulrject to certain Regulations, by 19 & 20 Geo. III. c. 29—23 & 24 Geo. III. c. 38. The Statute 36 Geo. III. c. 43 contains further Provisions upon the subject, and seems to annul the exception of Jews, but coniines the benefit of the Statutes to persons who shall previously have obtained a Licence from the Chief Governor in Council.—See 1 Gabbett, c. 10, p. 307.

For Statutes 14 & 12 W. III. c. 6, for enabling natural-born Subjects to inherit, notwithstanding their Parents were Aliens, and 25 Geo. III. c. 39, obviating doubts on that Statute, see Part II. Class 1.]

(1) These and the following words, which in all the editions of the Statutes are printed as part of the fourth Section, are the Preamble to the fifth. - In consequence of not attending to this, it has been erroneously stated by several writers, and some Judges, that the word Simony does not occur in the Statute. See Burns' Ecc. Law, Art. Simony. The division into Sections does not appear in the original Records, and is merely the act of the printer.

(2) It was established by several cases, that a general bond of resignation was not Void by this Statute, but Courts of Equity prevented such bonds from being made an improper use of; and it was latterly considered, that the opinion in favour of their legality rested rather upon the

authority of established Precedents than upon a true construction of the Statute. In the case of the Bishop of London v. Ffytche, before the House of the Lords, in 1783, the Courts of Common Pleas and King’s Bench decided in favour of the bond, but the judgment was reversed contrary to the opinion of the majority of the Judges, but with the concurrence of Lord Chancellor Thur-low. A detailed account of the case was published by Mr. Cunningham, and the opinions of some of the Judges, with the speeches of some of the Bishops and the Lord Chancellor, are contained in Burns’ Ecc. Law, Art. Simony. In Bagshaw v. Bossley, 4 T. R. 78, a bond to resign in case of nonresidence or committing waste on the parsonage was sustained, Lord Kenyon said| ^.c; ie

And that it shall and may be lawful to and for the Queen’s Majesty, her heirs and successors, to present collate unto or give or bestow every such benefice dignity prebend and living ecclesiastical for that one time or (urn only; (5) and that all and every person or persons, bodies politic and corporate, that from thenceforth shall give or take any such sum of money reward gift or benefit, directly or indirectly, or that shall take or make any such promise grant bond covenant or other assurance, shall forfeit and lose the double value (6) of one year’s profit of every such benefice dignity prebend and living ecclesiastical; and the person so corruptly (7) taking procuring seeking or accepting any such benefice dignity prebend or living, shall thereupon and from thenceforth be adjudged a disabled person in law, to have or enjoy the same benefice dignity prebend or living ecclesiastical.

tt‘ I avoid saying any thing respecting the case of the Bishop of London r. Ffytche, when that question comes again before the House of the Lords, they will, I have no doubt, review their former decision, if it should become necessary. It is sufficient for me, in deciding the present case, to say, that it cannot be governed by that.” In Partridge v, Whiston, id. 359, upon a bond to resign for the Patron’s son to be presented, the Court of B. R. understanding that it was intended to take the case to the House of Lords, gave judgment for the plaintiff without argument. They said as this was not precisely similar to the case of the Bishop of London t>. Ffytche, they were bound by the established Series of Precedents. It does not appear from the last edition of Brown's P. C. that the case came before the House of Lords. In Legh v. Lewis, 1 East, 391, where a bond of resignation by a Schoolmaster was holden good, the Court referred to Ffytche The Bishop of London, as being founded solely upon the authority of the Statute. See also Newman v. Newman, 4 M. & . 66, in which it appears to be the opinion of the Court that a bond to resign in favour of a particular person, is good.

(3) An Inclosure Act recited it as uncertain whether the Chaplain or Curate were entitled to the several tithes, or to a certain money-payment, and declared that nothing therein should affect such right. The inhabitants afterwards

elected J. P. and entered into an agreement, signed by him, for a certain augmentation, and a proviso that the augmentation should be only made upon the occupiers, and should not alter the

payment of----with which the lands had

immemoriably been charged. This was ruled to be Simoniacal, as intended to estop the Curate from insisting oil his right to tithes, and to furnish evidence against future Curates. Rex v. Bishop of Oxford, 7 East. 600. For other cases of Simony see Com. Dig. Esglise. No. 3.

(4) This is held to mean not merely voidable, and a Simonical presentation may be shewn as a defence in a suit for tithes—3 Inst. 120—but a tenant of the glebe cannot, after payment of rent to the Incumbent, dispute his title on the ground of Simony.—Cooke v. Loxley, 5 T. R. 4.

(5) But a Simoniacal presentation by usurpation does not authorize the King to present if a prejudice to the rightful Patron. 3 Inst. 153. Vide 1 Mars. 292. 5 Taunt. 727.

(6) This is to be accounted the real value, as formed by a jury, and not the valuation in the King's books. 3 Inst. 154.

(7) If the Presentee is not privy to the Simony he is not disabled from being presented upon another vacancy, but if privy he is disabled for life—2 Hawk. 396____12 Co. 101.

Rep. 851, which was an action for money had and received to try the title of the plaintiff as Incumbent of a donative: two questionstvere made—1st, Whether an Incumbent of a donative were obliged to conform to this Statute and 13 Elis, (supra No. 6,) as to which the Court strongly inclined to think in the affirmative, observing, that the point seemed to have been settled in Carver r. Pinckney, 3 Leo. 82. 2dly, Whether it were necessary for him to give evidence in that action that he had complied with the Statutes, upon which the Court Were of opinion, that as no evidence had been given by the defendant to raise a doubt whether the plaintiff had subscribed, &c. it was not in* cumhcnt on him to give evidence of his having genially done so. The presumption (said De

Grey, C. J.) always is, that every man conforms to the Laws, and that presumption shall stand till something appears to shake it; nor is the defendant hereby put upon proving a direct negative.—It is a negative qualified with circumstances.'—Some of these ceremonies are to be performed publicly within a limited time. Registers are kept of the others. And if evidence had been given that a person had regularly at* tended the Church and heard nothing of this matter, or if a search had been made in the Bishop’s Register and nothing had been fbund therein, this would have destroyed the presumption* and put the plaintiff on the proof of his having performed these requisites.—5.

* Marriages of the Royal Family,

Marriage. [Part I.

♦XVII. Provided always, That this Actor any thing therein contained shall notextond to the Marriages of any of the Royal Family.

XV7III. Provided likewise. That nothing in this Act contained shall extend to that part of Great Britain called Scotland, nor to any Marriages amongst the people called Quakert, or amongst the persons y

Jewish religion, where both the parties to any such Marriage shall the people called Quakers, or persons professing the Jewish religion respectively nor to any marriages solemnized beyond the seas. (6)

and of Quakers and Jews, and of Persons in Scotland or beyond the seas excepted.

(6) Soon after the passing of the Act it was decided in the Court of Delegates in a case of Bearcroft v, Bearcraft, that a marriage between two English persons who go to Scotland solely for the purpose, is valid; and such is now the established law. [Notwithstanding the want of banns or licence. Ex parte HalL 1 Rose 30. In former times it was a question whether marriages of minors in Scotland were legal. Grierson r. Grierson, Dick. 588.]

Upon a trial, on the Home Circuit, for Polygamy, (in which it is necessary to prove an actual marriage, ] evidence was required of the Caw of Scotland with respect to the legality of the first marriage, which was there contracted; and the evidence of such, being the known law of the country, was rejected in consequence of the unfitness of the person whose testimony was adduced upon the subject; —and the Judge is said to have intimated, that such evidence should be by the certificate of the Lord Advocate or other authorised person, and that the Court upon such subject would not attend to the information of a tobacconist. This case, which I partly cite from recollection of newspaper reports, but which, since composing the principal part of this note, ! find referred to in the case of the King and Brampton, 10 East, 285, involves in its decision principles which would require a very serious examination before they were generally adopted. In the first place—the necessity of requiring any evidence at all upon the subject, is a great and important question, when considered as a general question respecting the mutual recognition of the laws of the different parts of the United Kingdom. Information may be often very properly applied for, for the mutual assistance of the tribunals of the respective parts of the United Kingdom, but that is the information of science, the counsel of an assessor, and not the information of evidence, which is of. a perfectly different nature—and if such evidence was necessary in the particular case, it is equally necessary in all cases when a question of the law of one member of the kingdom becomes a matter of incidental enquiry in the other.—2. But if it was necessary that evidence should be given upon the general principle that the law of other countries is matter of fact, and as such ought to be proved, it seems a most extraordinary doctrine to hold that the mere situation in life of a witness can be taken as an objection to the reception of his testimony. The situation in life, or the habits and character of a witness, may be fairly taken into consideration in determining the effect of his evidence as to adequacy of knowledge, or as to the degree of credit which he shall receive,

but cannot, upon any correct judicial principles, be opposed as a bar to his admissibility; and it cannot be supposed that in the particular case, if the evidence had been regarded as otherwise than legally exceptionable, a serious doubt could have been stated to the jury upon its credit or accuracy with jrespect to a matter of such general and undoubted notoriety.—3. As the subject may come in question with respect to marriages contracted in dikant countries, it is proper to . consider whether a proof of two persons having in any manner or form agreed to enter into the relation of husband and wife, and having been afterwards reputed as such, should not be taken as sufficient until positive evidence is offered of its invalidity. Marriage, however important a contract it may be, is only a contract to which no particular ceremony or public sanction is requisite in its own nature, or according to the laws which in some countries, especially Scotland, actually subsist. In most countries however, peculiar solemnities are very judiciously superinduced as easentialto the validity of this engagement—but the necessity of such solemnities is not to be presumed; and the primary evidence which I have alluded to would therefore seem sufficiently contradicted by other testimony, shewing the necessity of further requisites than such as upon general principles would be sufficient*.

Upon a trial for Polygamy, before Mr. Serjeant Marshall, as Judge of Assize, at Lancaster Summer Assizes, 1814, evidence of a marriage in Ireland, by a Dissenting Clergyman, was held sufficient, without giving any proof of the Law of Ireland upon the subject.

With respect to the actual law of Ireland, it is expressly provided, by Statute 21 and 22 Geo. III. c. 25, that marriages between Protestant Dissenters, solemnized by Dissenting Ministers or Teachers, shall be valid. The Acts of the Irish Parliament, containing provisions against the marriage of Protestants with Catholics, or Protestants •with Protestants, by any Popish Priest, acknowledge by necessary implication the validity of ruch marriages between Catholics.—See 1 Gab-bett, 410-411.

In the late case of Dalrymple r. Dalrymple, before the Consistory Court of London, and afterwards before the Delegates for restitution of conjugal rights, evidence was given of the Law of Scotland, by the principal lawyers of that country, upon regular depositions.—See the report of the case by Dr. Dodson.

In the case of the King and the Inhabitants of Brampton, 10 East, 282, a British soldier in St. Domingo being desirous of marrying the widow of anothersoldier there, they went to a chapel where

the ceremony was performed by a person appearing as a Priest, and officiating as such, the service being in French, but interpreted into English by one who officiated as clerk, and which was understood to be the marriage service of the Church of England, after which there was a cohabitation of several yean. The Court of Quarter Sessions thought upon a question of settlement, that this was not sufficient evidence of a legal aaarriage !but fortunately, not considering it as a case affected by the hints so often thrown out to that tribunal, of the confidence which they ought to entertain in their own opinion, they stated a case for the opinion of the Court of King’s Bench, who considered that there was sufficient evidence of a good marriage either according to the Law of England or according to the Law of the Country where it took place. —The case contains some important information respecting the doctrine of marriages per verba de presently previous to this ststute, for the validity of which it appears that the presence of a clergyman was requisite; but that a marriage by a Roman Catholic clergyman was sufficient.

British subjects, resident in s British settlement -abroad, are governed, with respect to marriage, by the law hich existed here before the marriage Oct, vis. the Canon law. Therefore, where two British subjects, being Protestants, were married at Madras, by a Portuguese Roman Catholic Priest, according to the Catholic form, in the Portuguese language, in a private room, and the ceremony was followed by cohabitation; held that this was a valid marriage, though without a licence from the Governor, which it is the custom at Madras to obtain. Lautour v. Teesdalc, 2 Mars. 243.

One of the mischiefs-against which the act was intended to provide, was the establishing officers in the Fleet and other places for the celebration of clandestine marriages. Books have been preserved of the entries of such marriages, but from the many fabricated entries which they have been found to contain, different Judges have refused to receive them in evidence, but they were admitted' by Mr. Justice Heath in Pasingham v. Lloyd, at Shrewsbury assizes, 1794. See Peake’s Evidence, 39. In Cooke v. Lloyd, Append, ibid. 74. Mr. Justice Le Blanc refused to receive such an entry in evidence, as being no more than a private memorandum made by somebody who had no authority to make it, and who might put down any thing he pleased, whether true or false. But it is observable, that in none of these cases the question was carried farther than the Court of Nisi Prius— and the case of Lloyd and Pasingham coming before the Court of Chancery, after an interval of fourteen years, upon some grounds for imputing actual forgery to the particular entry in that case, the Lord Chancellor considered the general question as one which was still open. See 16 Vesey, 59. Considering the state of the law before the passing of the act, it certainly does not seem desirable in the nature of the thing to excludes species of evidence which would continually result from and accompany the actual occurrence of the fact recorded, and any experience of improper practices with respect to the custody and management of

the books at a particular place, would hardly seem sufficient to prevent the admissibility of the evidence, whatever cautions it might reasonably suggest with respect to its credibility.

Many doubts have been entertained of the policy and justice of this act, as giving an undue weight to parental authority; and an unsuccessful attempt was made in- 1781 to repeal it. Mr. Burke’s speech against the repeal, contained in his Works, vol. 9. Bvo. 135, is a very satisfactory *0d abl? yjiulicrtWt of the let. Considering the motives which usually lead to an infraction of this act, and the opinions manifested by the laws of almost all countries in favour of giving to parents an interposition with respect to the marriage of their children under a certain age, I conceive it would be desirable that provisions should be made for rendering it effectual. For this purpose it may not be improper to require that every direction for the publication of banns, should specify the ages of the parties, their particular habitation, their parentage and other proper requis; tes; and that some authentic testimony should be given to the Minister of the particulars certified: and that Upon marriage by licence, the documents should specify the time and place of the birth of the parties, confirmed by registers or other suitable certificates, or that the officer should have some other authentic testimony of tkeir being of the requisite age; and that all such consents as are required by law, should be registered with the other documents necessary for obtaining the licence.

The exemption of marriages in Scotland being subject to such great abuse, it would be an easy remedy to prohibit all such marriages as are at present irregular, and as such subject to punishment. This would have the effect of preventing an engagement, in the certainty of which so many interests may be involved from depending upon the precariousness of verbal evidence, and it would also prevent a party from being involved by presumptions in an engagement which it was never his intention to contract. It might be of some public benefit in facilitating the evidence of marriages after the death of the parties, if a particular part of the parish registers were appropriated to the entry of minutes of reference respecting marriages contracted elsewhere.

By an act of the Irish Parliament, 9 Geo. IL c. 11. marriages are prohibited of minors, without the consent, in writing, of the father or guardian, or in case no guardian is appointed, of the Lard Chancellor, if either of the parties is entitled to a real estate of the value of 100/. per annum, or a personal estate of the value of 500/.—or if either of the parents of the minor is entitled to a real estate of the value of 100/. per annum, or a personal estate of the value of 2000L; —but if no suit is instituted by the father or guardian, or a person appointed by the Lord Chancellor, for the purpose of annulling the marriage, within one year after it a contracted, it is to be deemed good. By stat. 23 Geo. 11. Cr 10. Ir. provisions are made for the removal of certain difficulties with respect to such sutab—See I Gabb, 404 *

BASTARDS.

(1) While we applaud, With the most perfect sincerity, the manly independence of our ancestors, who, in the true spirit of wisdom prrtwunced this memorable answer, we cannot but regret, that many of their posterity have drawn inferences from ir, which the premise* were by no means competent to support—and from the mere refusal to adopt a particular maxim of foreign law, hk deference and submission to the then established church; the general law, of which this maxim constituted a part, was considered of so dangerous and obnoxious a character, that the mere knowledge of it was almost considered as dangerous and infectious—and that it was impossible to resort to its assistance for hints of practicable improvement, with due regard to adaption and a discriminating judgment, without necessarily inducing an implicit submission to its authority, in matters prejudicial end fhapplicaMe. 1 do not conceive that the pre. judice still subsists, in the same form and shape— hut it certainly does In another, which is, that to stick to Cornyn’s Digest, Tidd’s Practice, and (he index to the Term Reports, as a much more commodious method of cultivating legal science, than that oftaking a more excursive range for the purpose of cultivating the general principles of judicial reasoning.

Upon the immediate suliject of the particular law before us, I apprehend that almost every unprejudiced mind will concur in the opinion ot its wisdom and good sense, in disapproving the principle of permitting the character of family relations to depend upon retrospect and fiction; and In regarding the open celebration of marriage as a pledge

between the individuals and society, with respect to the character of the future offspring

Evident, however, as tMa opinion appears to he, the generality with which the opposite doctrine has been adopted in the .different states of Europe, is very remarkable.—ItbtMgnot only fofftedta the ancient systems, which may be Supposed 'to have been influenced by that deference which tfor ancestors withstood, but retailed in the reformed establishment of Scotland, and in the modern codes of Pnotia and France, the latter of which, in matters where no motives of political influence could intervene, presents system which the wannest opponents of the government by which it was established may contemplate with approbation.

A recent Instance occurred of n very striking application by the House of Lords to the doctrine of legitimation, by subsequent marriage according to the taw of Scotland, in a case of M‘Adam v. Walker, 1 Dow. 148, in which it appeared, that a party calling his domestics together, presented to them a woman, with whota he cohabited at a mistress, and his children by her, as being his wife and legitimate children, and afterwards, on the same day, shot himself.

There is soother subject pertly connected with the law before us, of no ioccnaiderable importance; the repudiating the filiation of children born in marriage, in conscience of the absence of tilt husband from the WfFe.—llie cases upon this subject will be particularly averted to m a note on the title Bcutards, in the division of this Collection which relates to the office of Justices of Peace.

* and Walef; and where such offices were annual offices it hath been found very difficult, if not impracticable by the laws now in being, to bring to a trial and determination the right of such persons to the said offices within the compass of the year; and where such offices were not annual

* offices, it hath been found difficult to try and determine the right of

* such persons to such offices, before they have done divers acts in their said offices prejudicial to the peace order and good government within € such cities towns corporate boroughs and places wherein they have

* respectively acted: And whereas divers persons who had a right to suen offices, or to be burgesses or freemen of such cities towns corporate boroughs or places have either been illegally turned out of the

* same or have been refused to be admitted thereto, having in many of

* the said cases no other remedy to procure themselves to be respectively

* admitted or restored to their said offices or franchises of being burgesses 1 or freemen than by writs of Mandamus, the proceedings on which are

* very dilatory and expensive, whereby great mischiefs have already en* sued, and more are likely to ensue if not timely prevented :* For remedy whereof be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the first day of Trinity term in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eleven, where any writ of Mandamus shall issue out of the Court of Queen's Bench, the Courts of Sessions of Counties Palatine, or out of any the Courts of Grand Sessions in Wales in any of the cases aforesaid, such person or persons who by the laws of this realm are required to make a return (1) to such writ of Mandamus, shall make his or their return to the first writ of Mandamus.

4 And that in default thereof every such placing election and choice

(1) On a mandamus to admit, the party applying must prove that he had taken the sacrament according to the Statute 13 Car. 2. and the case is not within the Statute, as the person never was admitted, and therefore cannot be removed. Tuft an r. Nevinson, 2 Lord Raym. 1354. 1 Str. 585. But where a party elected obtained a mandamus to deliver the common seal, &c. when a return was made of not duly elected, i: was held that since the Statute the election was not void, but only voidable, and that as there was no removal within the limited time the election stood confirmed and became absolute; and that the case differed from the preceding one, as the plaintiff was in possession of the office. Crawford v. Powell, 2 Bur. 1013. In Harrison v. Evans, Wilm. 159. Lord Ch. J. Wilmot said, the Act only affects cases where there has been six months* possession, and is rather a statute of limitations founded upon public convenience, to guard against the violent operation of the annulling words in the Corporation Act. But before the six months are expired, and even afterwards where there has been no possession of the office under such an

election, the operation of the former law is not at all varied by it. And in Rex v. Monday, Cowper, 539. Lord Mansfield observed to the same effect, that the Statute 5 Geo. 1. c. 6. operates rather as a protection to the possession than as a bar to the remedy. If a man under this disability has been in possession six months, there shall be no remedy to turn him out: his title shall not afterwards be questioned on that ground. It is similar to the rule laid down by this court in respect of informations where the party has been in pot-session twenty years. But if this objection is made recetitly before any possession; as suppose the party upon being refused to be sworn in waa to* apply for a mandamus, and the answer on the application should be, that the ground of refusal was because he had hot taken the sacrament, I should think it a sufficient objection. It it the possession only that is protected; and that, not till after the expiration of six months. The object of the Act' was to lessen the rigour of the Stat. 13 Car. II. made in warmer times; and that has gone a great way. See also Rex v. Hawkins, 10 East, 211. 2 Dow. 124.

III. c. 48.—An Act for regulating the Proceedings of certain Public Companies and Corporations carrying on Trade or Dealings with Joint Stocks, in respect to the declaring of Dividends; and for further regulating the Qualification of Members for voting in their respective General Courts.

yWHEREAS by virtue of divers acts of Parliament, and of Royal y Geo. IIL Charters founded thereupon, certain public companies or coipora- c. 48. dons have been instituted Jfor the purpose of carrying on particular trades or dealings with joint stocks; and the management of the affairs of such companies has been vested in their general courts, composed of the members at large of such companies respectively; in which general courts every member of each respective company possessed of such share in the stock of the company as in and by the said Acts of Parliament and charters is limited with regard to each of the said companies respectively, is qualified and in titled to give a vote or votes: And whereas of late years a most unfair and mischievous practice has been introduced of splitting large quantities of stock, and making separate and temporary conveyances of the parts thereof, for the purpose of multiplying or making occasional votes immediately before the time of declaring a dividend, of chusing directors, or of deciding any other important question; which practice is subversive of every principle upon which the establishment of such general courts is founded, and if suffered to become general would leave the permanent interest of such companies liable at all times to be sacrificed to the partial and interested views of a few, and those perhaps temporary proprietors* Be it therefore enacted by the King's roost excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the first day of August one thousand seven hundred and Members dis-sixty-seven, no member of any of the said Public Companies or Corpora- qualified from tions instituted for the purpose aforesaid, shall be deemed qualified to voting in a Gc-vote, or be admitted to give any vote or votes, in any general court of any nersl Court such company in respect of any stock transferred to him her or them who were not after the said first day of August one thousand seven hundred and sixty- possessed of seven, until he she or they shall have been possessed of such stock six Stock rix calendar months; unless such.stock shall have been acquired or shall months; ex-] have come by bequest, or by marriage, or by succession to an intestate’s ccl* Ac.c. estate, or by the custom of the city of London, or by any deed of settlement after the death of any person who shall have been mtitled for life to the dividends of such stock.

II. And be it further enacted by the .authority aforesaid, That the Oaths to be several and respective oaths and affirmations which are* at present, either taken, by virtue of any Act of Parliament or by any charter of any of the said companies, required to be administered to or taken by the members intitled to vote in the general courts of the said companies respectively, at or before giving their votes, shall, from and after the said first day of August one thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven, be altered in such manner as to exteud to and comprise the further qualification required by this Act in respect of the continuance of the possession of such stock

as aforesaid; and that the said oaths and affirmations so-altered as aforesaid, shall from and after the said first day of August one thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven, be severally and respectively administered to and taken by the members of such companies in the place of these heretofore required to be Administered and taken.

III. And forasmuch as no part of the business transacted by the general courts of the said companies can be of more importance to the general and lasting interest of the companies themselves, or to the preservation of public credit so closely connected with that interest, than what concerns the fixing from time to time of the dividends to be made out of the profits and produce of their joint stocks among the several proprietors having shares therein:And forasmuch as the provisions hitherto made have not been found sufficient to prevent many great and dangerous irregularities being practised in relation to the making of sudden and unwarrantable alterations in the rates of such dividends: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the tenth day of Ju/y one thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven, no declaration of a dividend shall lie made by any general court of any of the said companies, other than one of the half-yearly or quarterly general courts, at the distance of five calendar months at the least from the last preceding declaration of a dividend; and that no declaration of more than one half-yearly dividend shall be made by one general court; and that no question upon any proposition for increasing the rate of the dividend shall be decided otherwise than by ballot, to be taken at the distance of three entire days, at the least, from the adjournment or breaking up of the general court in which such question shall have been proposed.

IV. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That this Act shall be deemed and taken to be a publick Act, of which notice shall be judicially taken by all judges justices and other persons whatsoever, without specially pleading the same.

(* J A guardian in socage has an interest, and may make a lease of the land of the ward. The husband or guardian in socage acquires the guardianship, but his lease is only good during the coverture. Osborne v. Carden, Plowden, 293. In that case the quality of guardian in socage is particularly discussed. Guardians in secage may grant the reversion of a copyhold according to the custom of the manor which binds the lord. Stop-land v. Rudlen, Owen 115. Godb. I. . C. Cro.

The right of the mother as guardian in socage, cannot be set up against the lord of a copyhold claiming as guardian by custom. Id.

(*) That the word Grant in the conveyance of an estate of freehold does not create a warranty, is abundantly clear from all the authorities upon the subject. See Co. Lit. 384. [a] Butler's note, ibid. Spencer'j case, 5 Co. 18. although die word Gins has that effect. 1 think it b rather to be regretted, that notwithstanding the unquestionable and settled law in this respect, those who are perfect masters of the subject give countenance to the unfounded scruples which are entertained concerning it, by declining to insert the word Grant in conveyances from trustees. It is singular that a Judge of so much eminence as Mr. Justice Buller, should have stated that the words Grunt and Enfeoff amount 16 a general warranty in law, and have the same force and effect, and should

refer to Nokes's case, 4 Rep. 80. as settling that point. Browning v. Wright, 2 Bosanquet and Puller.—Nokes's case relates to the demise of a term in which the words Demise and Grant operate as a covenant unless there is an express covenant, in which case the general and implied covenant of law is restrained. A practice has been lately introduced in conveyancing^ of declaring previous to the general words of conveyance, that the party conveys “ so far only as he can or may, and not further or otherwise, and that he intends only to pass his interest and not to warrant the estate.” I think the practice should be discountenanced, as tending to introduce erroneous opinions upon the subject.

of the lord of the manor by customary tenure were enfeoffed by the lord to the tenant in fee-farm, subject to a yearly rent, in lieu of all manner of ciher rents suits services exactions and demands. By a subsequent deed it was recited, that as a consideration for the former it was agreed that the feoffee and all others who should hold his estate, should do suit and service and appear at Courts Baron, and be subject to fines and amerciaments assessed by the homage; and the party to the deed (the heir of the original feoffee) covenanted in default of performing suit and service to pay 2s. 6d. And it was decided that an action of debt for the amerciament of 2s. 6d. for not attending the court, could not be maintained. Lord Kenyon said. The 4ord conveyed the property of which the defendant is now seised, to the defendant’s ancestor a customary tenant. But it has been mid that the old service! were reserved by the reservation of the fee-farm rent; but if the relation of lord and tenant absolutely ceased to exist, that rent can no longer be considered as rent service, but a rent to be recovered according to the contract between the parties. After the statute of Quia emptores, the lard could not by any deed reserve the old services when he conveyed away the estate in respect of which the services were due, for the tenant must hold of the superior lord. By the conveyance the estate was no longer parcel of the manor, nor held of the manor, neither was the defendant's ancestor any longer a tenant of the manor.

It was contended in a most learned argument, that the only effect of the deed was by means of covenants to compound for the payment of certain parts of the rents, and for the performance of certain burthensome services, but excepting to the lord the remainder according to the ancient tenure; and secondly, that if this were no longer the old customary estate as between lord and tenant, yet the collateral customs as to strangers might still remain; but it was decided that by the operation of the deed the immediate customs by which the tenement was distinguished from other lands holden in free and common socage had been extinguished, and the land became devisable as any other socage land under the statute of wills* The case contains a great deal of important learning respecting the extinction of tenure by the release of services, and affords one of the best views which can be any where had of the customary estates peculiar to the north of England, for which border services were anciently performed* See also Townlty v.

A Woman *

(1) In Eyston a Studde, Plowden 459, it was held, that where a husband and wife seised in right of the wife, levied a fine to a third person who rendered the land to the husband and wife and the heirs of their bodies, the disposition of the wife after the death of the husband was not within the operation of the statute, although within the words as a purchase by the husband; u ior many times, things within the words of a statute are out of the purview, for the purview does not extend beyond the intent of the makers. And the intent is more to be weighed than the words of acts, and the intent here was that where women have jointures which proceed originally from their husbands, or the ancestors of their husbands, to restrain them from causing disherison or other injury to the heirs of their husbands, and therefore a person ought not to rest on the letter, or suppose that wherever he has the letter he has the law in his favour."—And a very valuable and elaborate note is subjoined to the case respecting the principles on which a more enlarged or restricted sense ought to be given to the words of a statute in order to answer the intent. For the general exposition of this statute, see Gilb. Uses and Trusts, 339, [157] with Mr. Sugden's notes, from which the following summary is taken.

The statute does not extend to s case where a wife before marriage conveys to the ancestor of the intended husband who recenveys to the husband and wife in tail, Plowden, ibid, or to a rent granted by the conusee of a fine of the wife’s land, Foster r. Pitfall, Cro. Eliz. 2. Nor will the husband paying a sum of money to the wife’s father vary the case. Semble Copland v. Pigot.

Neither does the statute extend to a gift by a stranger, although in consideration of services rendered by the husband. Ward v. Walthew, Cro. Jac. 153. Mo. 683, by the name of Ward tv Sudman. See Cro. Car. 244.

The statute does extend to a settlement By the husband or his ancestors in consideration of marriage, although money is also paid. Anon Mo. 93. Villen v. Lincoln, Dyer 146 a. 1 Rep. 176 a. Bendl. SeL 208 a. Kirk man r. Thompson, Cro. Jac. 474:to a settlement made by the husband by way of feoffment and reinfeoffment, Mo. ubi supra: to the husband’s moiety of lands, whereof the husband and wife are seised as. joint tenants. Laughter t*. Humphrey, Cro. Elix. 524:and every alienation contrary to the spirit of the statute is void, although not within the letter of it, Pigget v. Palmer, Mo. 250. 3 Rep. 516. The statute only applies to cases where the alienstion necessarily tends to the disherison of the heirs of the husband, ’and therefore not when the remainder is limited to a stranger with no estate of inheritance to the husband or his heirs, Foster v. Pitfall, Cro. Eliz. 2.* 1 Leon, 261: or to the wife in fee. Dennis's case, Dyer 248. R. v. Savage, Mo. 715. or in tail general. Hughs t>. Clubb, 1 Com. 369. It does not extend to cases where the consent of the next heir appears on record, Lincoln Coll, case 3 Co. 58 b. See Coates c. Price, 12 Vesey 89. A trust or equity of redemption is within the statute, Clifton r. Jackson, 2 Vera. 489: Copyholds are not, Harrington v. Smith, 2 Sid. 41—73: aliter of a copyhold whereof husband and wife are seised, and which is enfranchised for a money consideration paid by the husband. Stockbridge’s case, Cro. Eliz. 24.

* that they were put in, have refused to intermeddle in any wise with the

* execution of the said will and testament, or with the sale of such lands 1 so willed to be sold by the Testator. And forasmuch as a bargain and

* sale of such lands tenements or other hereditaments so willea by any person to be sold by his Executors after his decease, after the opinion of 1 divers persons, (1) can in no wise be good or effectual in the law unless 1 the same bargain and sale be made by the whole number of the Execu* tors named to and for Ibe same; by reason whereof, as well the debts of 1 such Testators have rested unpaid and unsatisfied, to the great danger and peril of the souls of such Testators, and to the great hindrance and

II. Provided alway, That this Act shall not extend to give power or authority to any Executor or Executors at any time hereafter to bargain or put to sale any lands tenements or hereditaments, by virtue and authority of any will or testament heretofore made, otherwise than they might.do by the course of the common law afore the making of this Act. (9)

(1) In Withnell v. Gartham, 6 T. R. 396, Lord Kenyon infers from this expression that the Act was passed rather to remove doubts than to make a new law.

(2) The doctrine established respecting this statute is contained in the following note, by Mr. Sugden, to Gilbert's Uses and Trusts, 128. [<*]

“ The statute does not apply to a case of DmUh* nor was it necessary that it should. The Act was passed before the Statute of Uses, and only related to devises by persons having other persons seised to their use, and in words, it only provided for cases where lands are willed to be old, that is, where a power is given; but it waa held, since the Statute of Uses, to extend to an

absolute devise by a person seised in fee of the legal estate to sell, as wall as to a power; Bomfimt v. Greenfield, Cro. Elia. 80. See Rro, Devise, pi. 3.; and Hawkins r. Kemp, 3 East, 410. The devise must be to the persons as Executor*; or at least the fund, when raised, must be distributable by them in that character.-^A mere devise to persons to sell, and afterwards an appointment of them as executors, will not, it is said, bring the case within the Act. It waa not, however, necessary to decide the point, because a refund by the other executors was not shown. Denne v. Judge,

11 East, 288; see Bonifant v. Greenfield, ubi sup. Them is an observation of Lord Kenyon's on the preamble of the Act, in 6 Term. Rep. 396. (See the preceding note.) k must be

remembered that it only applies where one of the ekecuton refum to join; and even where that Is the case, a cautious purchaser will not accept a conveyance from one, because the other may have previously sold to some other person. Whether the receipt of the acting executor will be a good discharge under the usual power' to give receipts, see Treat, of Purch. p. 367. s. 17.”

And the following is the result of Mr. Sugden’s examination of the esses respecting powers that do or do not survive. Treatise on Powers, ch. 3. e.2. pa. 140.

* 1st. That where the power is given to two

or more by their proper names, who are not made executors, it will not survive without express words. 2d* That where it is given to three or more, generally, as, to my Trustees, my Sons, dec* and not by their proper names, the authority will survive whilst the plural number remains* 3d. That where the authority is given to Executory and the will does not expressly point to a joint exercise of it, even a single surviving executor may execute it. But 4th. That where it is given to them nomtnattm, although in the character of executors, yet it is at least doubtful whether it will survive.”

[No. XIV.] 32 Henry VIII. c.34.—Concerning Grantees of Reversions to take Advantage of the Conditions to be performed by the Lessees.

INHERE before this time divers as well temporal as ecclesiastical and religious persons have made sundry leases demises and grants to divers other persons of sundry manors lordships ferms meases lands tenements meadows pastures or other hereditaments, for term of life or lives or for term of years, by writing under their seal or seals containing certain conditions covenants ana agreements to be performed as well on the part and behalf of the said lessees and grantees their executors and assigns as on the behalf of the said lessors and grantors their heirs and successors; and forasmuch as by the common law of this realm no stranger to any covenant action or condition shall take any advantage or benefit of the same by any means or ways in the law, but only such as be parties or privies thereunto, by die reason whereof as well all grantees of reversions as also all grantees and patentees of the King our Soverign Lord, of sundry manors lordships granges ferms meases lands tenements meadows pastures or other hereditaments* late belonging to monasteries and other religious and ecclesiastical houses dissolved suppressed renounced relinquished forfeited given up, or by other means come to the hands and possession of the King’s Majesty 6ince the fourth day of February, the seven and twentieth year of hift most noble reign, bo excluded to have any entry or action against the said lessees and grin tees their executors or assigns, which the lessors before that time might by the law have had against the same lessees for the breach of any condition Covenant or agreement comprised! in the indentures of their said leases demises and grants* Be it therefore enacted by the King our Sovereign Lord the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, That as well all and every persons and bodies politick their heirs successors and assigns, which have or shall have any gift or grant of our said Sovereign Lord by his letters patents of any lordships manors lands tenements rents parsonages tithes portions or any other hereditaments, or of any reversion or reversions of the same, which did belong or appertain to any of the said monasteries and

(1) The following exposition of this Act is given by Sir Edward Coke, 1 Inst. 215.

« Upon this Act divers resolutions and judgements have been given which are necessary to be known.

1. That the said Statute is general, vis. that the grantee of the reversion of every common person as well as of the King shall take advantage of conditions.

9. That the Statute doth extend to grants made by the successors of the King, albeit the King be only named in the Act.

3. That where the Statute speaketh of lessees, that the same doth not extend to gifts in taiL

4. That where the Statute speaks of grantees sad assignees of the reversion, that an assignee of

part of the state of reversion may take advantage of the condition. As if lessee for life be, Arc. and the reversion is granted for life, &c. So if lessee for years, &c. be, and the reversion is granted for yean, the grantee for yean shall take benefit of the condition in respect of this word executors in the Act.

5. That a grantee of part of the revenion shall not take advantage of the condition; as if the lease be of three acres, reserving a rent upon condition, and the revenion is granted of two acres, the rent shall be apportioned by the act of the parties, but the condition is destroyed, for thst it is entire and against common right.

6. That in the King’s case, the condition in thst case is not destroyed, but remains still in the

King.

202 Miscellaneous Statutes concerning Real Estates. [Part IL

7. By act in law a condition may be apportioned m the case of a common person; as if a lease for yean be made of two acres, one of the nature of Borough English, the other at the Common Law, and the lessor haring issue twe sons dieth, each of them shall enter for the condition broken, and likewise a condition shall be apportioned by the act and wrong of the lessee, as hath been said in the chapter of rents.

8. If a lease for life be made, reserving a rent upon condition, &c. the lessor levies a fine of the reversion, he is grantee or assignee of the reversion; but without attournment he shall not take Advantage of the condition, for the makers of the statute intended to have all necessary incidents observed, otherwise it might be mischievous to the lessee.

9. There is a diversity between a condition that is compulsory, and a power of revocation that is voluntary; for a man that hath a power of revocation may by his own act extinguish his power of revocation in part, as by levying of a fine of part; and yet the power shall remain for the residue, because it is in the nature of a limitation, and not of a condition; and so it was resolved in the Earl of Shrewsbury’s case in the Court of Wards. Pasch. 39 Eliz. and Mich. 40 and 41 Eliz.

10. If the lessor bargain and sell the reversion by deed' indented and inrolled, the bargainee is not in the per by the bargainor, and yet he is an assignee within the statute. So if the lessor grants the reversion in fee to the use of A and his heirs, A is a sufficient assignee within the statute, because he comes in by the act and limitation of the party, albeit he is in the past, and the words of the statute be, to or by, and they be assignees to him, although they be net by him; but such as come in merely by act in law, as the Lord of the Villiene, the Lord by Escheat, the Lord that entereth or claimeth by Mortmain, or the like, shall not take benefit of this statute.

11. If the lessor in the case before, bargain and sell the reversion by deed indented and inrolled, or if the lessor make a feoffment in fee, and the lessee re-enter, the grantee or feoffee shall not take any advantage of any condition without making notice to the lessee.

•12. Albeit the whole words of the statute be for non-payment of the rent, or for doing of waste oe other forfeiture, yet the grantees or assignees shall not take benefit of every forfeiture by force of a condition, but only of such conditions as other are incident to the reversion, as rent, or for the benefit of the state* as for not doing of waste, for keeping the houses in reparations, for making of fences, scouring of ditches, for preserving of woods, or such like, and not for the payment of any sum in > gross, delivery of corn wood, or the* like, so as other forfeiture shall be taken for other forfeitures like to those examples which were there put (viz.) of payment of rent, and not doing of waste which axe for the benefit of the reversion.” And see note ibid, in the

* Attournment is taken away per 4 5 Anne,

late editions of Co. Lit. from Lord Nottingham’s MSS.

The statute only gives a remedy for and against persons who by assignment become entitled to the reversion, the liability of the assignee of the term, and his right to maintain an action of covenant against the lessor and his heirs, is at Common Law.

Such an action can only be maintained against the assignee of the entire legal interest of the whole or part of the premises demised—therefore it cannot be maintained against the grantee of a lessee for lives for 99 years, if the lives should se long live, in as full and ample a manner as the lessee held.—Earl of Derby t>. Taylor, 1 East 502.

In Eaton v. Jacques, Doug. 454, it was held that a mortgagee by assignment of the whole leasehold interest, who had not taken possession, was not liable in covenant; but this is very much questioned by Lord Kenyon, in Westerdell & Dale, 7 Term Rep. 312. and Stone v. Evans, at N. P. cited 7 East 341. In Walker v. Reeves, Doug. 461, an averment tint the assignee continued in possession was hohlen insufficient as a replication to a plea that ho had assigned it over to another; but that case was decided by the same Judges, as Eaton and Jacques, and distinguished from it on the ground of the latter being a mortgage. Assignees under a commission of bankrupt having taken the property, as such are chargeable in‘covenant, and having once accepted the property they cannot afterwards reject it. But the merely offering it to sale is not such an assumption of the property as to charge them with the covenants. Turner r. Richardson, 7 East 335, and Browne r. Robinson, there cited. An executor or administrator upon whom a term devolves, is answerable de bonis propriis, as an assignee, Tilney v. Norris, 1 Salk. 309.

Covenant will lie against an assignee of part of the estate, Cougham v. King, Cro. Car. 222* Stevenson r. Lambard, 2 East 575, and in such an action there may be an apportionment of rent, although there cannot in the case of the immediate lessee.

It is settled that an assignee can only be charged for breaches incurred during his having the estate, in the premises, and that such liability is divested by an assignment to a beggar, or a person leaving the kingdom, or'who does not take actual possession, or to a feme covert whose husband does not assent, or a prisoner for debt. Pitcher v. Tovey, 1 Salk. 31. Bamfather v. Jordan, Doug. 425. Lekeux v, Nash, 2-Stf. 1221. Taylor v. Sturm, 1 Bos. and PulL 21. And notice of such assignment is not necessary. Pitcher v. Tovey, ub. supra.

It is also settled that a lessee continues liable notwithstanding any assignment, and such leasee cannot plead his bankruptcy in bar. Aurid r. Mills, 4 T. R. 94. except by virtueof 49 Geo* III# c. 121. which releases the bankrupt in ease the asrignees accept the lease and the benefit therefrom as a part of the estate.

It is agreed that the statute relates only to assignees of a-Tevexsion expectant upon, leases fox

Claes 1.] Miscellaneous Statute* concerning Real Estates. 208

life or yean, and not to the assignees of grantees in fee or tail; —and it is also evident that none of the expressions in the Statute give a right of action to the second assignee of a term against the first assignor. And the recital of the Statute, that by the Common Law no stranger to any covenant shall take any benefit or advantage of the same, but only such as be parties or privies- thereunto, with the necessity for such an enactment as constitutes the general purview of the Statute would seem to show, that where there is no reversion the aangnee of s purchaser of an estate would hare no remedy on the covenants of the original grantor, for between such grantor and the assignee there does not appear to be any actual privity.

But the law seems to be, that such assignee is entitled to the benefit of covenants for title made with his assignor or any under whom he claims. In Middlemen u. Goodale, RoL Abr. 521. (6 Viner .392) Cro. Car. 503—505. Sir William Jones, 406, the right to maintain such action upon a conveyance of the inheritance at com man law is admitted by the Court as clear law, and the right of a sub-asrignee of a tenn is also admitted both by the Court and Sir £. Coke as counsel for the defendant, in Andes u. Nones, Moore, 419, Cro. Elis. 373—436, and although in both them cases the judgment was given for the defendant on collateral grounds, and there does not appear to be any case in the books in which judgment was actually given for the assignee in an action upon such covenants, I apprehend that the right of maintaining such action may be regarded as a settled point.

A warranty extends to assigns if named, but otherwise not. Co. Lit. 384—6.

With respect to covenants for the payment’of a rent charge issuing out of land, the principal question in Brewster v. Kitchin, 1 Lord Ram. 317, was upon the construction of a covenant for the payment of a rent charge without deducting taxes, and the application of such a covenant to taxes newly imposed, upon which Hoi. C. J. delivered the opinion of the court in favour of the plaintiff; —» but then, '* says the Reporter, “ he made another question, which was not observed at the bar nor by any other of the other judges, viz. whether the tenre tenant is liable to an action upon this covenant, and he was of opinion that he was not. For by him, if tenant in fee grants a rent charge out of lands and covenants to pay it, 'without deduction for himself and his heirs, you may maintain covenant against the grantor and his heirs, but not against the assignee, for it-is a mere personal covenant and cannot run with the land; and for a case in point, he cited Hardres, 87 pL 5. Code and the Earl of Arundel.” Therefore since it doth not appear that the defendant ia bound by this covenant, for this reason, ho. was of opinion that judgment ought to bn given for the defendant. But the other three, judges seemed to bean a surprise, and not m truth to comprehend this objection, and therefore they persisted in their former opinion, talking of agreements, intent of the petty, binding the land, and 1 know not what. They gave judgment for the plaintiff against, the opinion of Holt Ch» J. for the reason aforesaid.

Although in the preceding case the decision was in favour of the plaintiff, the eminence not only of the <fisaentient judge, but of the reporter, who intimates his opinion in such striking terms, might probably afford sufficient ground for considering the question referred to as open to further enquiry—hut in Roach v. Wadharo, 6 East 289, which involved the tame point, the opinion of the court was in favour of the defendant upon another ground, and no question was made as to the liability of the defendant supposing him to stand in the character of assignee. Mr. Sugden in his Treatise on Powers, p. 237, animadverts with much particularity upon the ground of the decision, without touching upon die point in question, or rather taking it for granted; —but I should conceive that the mere negative argument of the point not haring engaged the attention of the eminent persons who decided that case cannot be regarded es decisive, if upon examination a different conclusion should be found more consonant to law. And no instance can better exemplify the weakness of such a negative argument in general, than that of Brewster v. Kitchin, in which the paint occurred only to the Chief Justice, whose name is at least an indisputable authority for its being a question entitled to considerable attention.

The case above referred to by C. J. Holt, of Cook r. Earl of Arundel, Hardres 87, was a suit in equity to make the defendant's lands subject to a fee-farm rent, and to charge them with it, for that the Duke of Norfolk, who had in his bands both the plaintiff s and defendant's lands subject to this rent, had granted the plaintiff's lands to one under whom the plaintiff claimed, and covenanted that they should be discharged from i his rent, upon which covenant the plaintiff sought relief, and would have taken it to be a real covenant which should run with the land, and charge the other lands with che whole rent; but the Court was clear of opinion that it was no morn than an ordinary and personal covenant which must charge the heir only in respect of assets and not otherwise.

In tha Year Book, 42 Ed. 3.—3. a case is cited and admitted of an action by an asrignee upon a covenant by one parcener upon a partition to acquit the other of suit—as a covenant running with the land—and the case is cited as undisputed law in Speocer's case, 5 Co. 18.1 Inst. 385* There are also two case# in the Year Books, 42Ed. 3.—8. 2 H. 4.-9. of covenants by a Friar with the consent of his convent to find a Priest to officiate in the chapel of the covenantee? and the intonations of the Court were, that such covenant might run with the land in favour of the alienee—neither of the cases was actually decided, but the doctrine-is deed as good lair by Lord. Coke in the paaages last referred to It seems however to deserve consideration, whether the doctrine could be applied to the case of air individual entering into any covenant in respect of the land of a stranger with which he had n» concern, to as to matntHin an action oo the covenant by an alienee, of the land.

In Heimes v. Buckley, Pkec. Ch» 3* 1 Eq.

vjOCK^IC

204 Miscellaneous Statutes concerning Real Estates. [Part II.

abr. 27, a person granted a watercourse and covenanted to cleanse it, and afterwards upon a suit in equity between the alienees of the respective parties, the Court held that it was a covenant that run with the land—-and decided accordingly; but one ingredient in the case was, that the cleaning had been rendered more chargeable by a building erected by the defendant.

|t In the Mayor, &c. of Carlisle v. Blamire, 8 East, 487, decided in favour of the defendant, upon a ground which will presently he mentioned, it seems clearly taken for granted, that upon the grant of so much of a river running through certain lands as would be sufficient for supplying a mill with water, an action might be maintained against the alienee of the land, upon a covenant not to divert the water.

In conveyances of small parcels of land, it is very common to insert covenants for building in a particular manner, or for not exercising particular trades. How far the covenants are binding, except between the immediate parties, seems very

Suestionable. There is no subsisting ptivity in lie grantor, in respect of any right or interest in the land to which after the alienation he is merely a stranger, still less is there any semblance of privity between the grantee and the owner of any other premises. The benefit of the covenant is not assignable at law as a matter in gross, neither does it appear to be a right transmissable by inheritance; and it may also be important to consider how far the doctrine involved in the two last mentioned cases, with respect to charging persons to whom land may come in a course of Alienation with covenants entered into by preceding owners, at any remote antecedent period, can legally be carried.

To the instances contained in the eighth member of the preceding extract from first Institutes, of a bargainee or a party taking under the Statute of Uses, because he comes in by the act and disposition of the party, may be added the case of a person who takes the reversion by a common recovery, and who, as the law is laid down in the case of Lincoln College, 3 Rep. 62, may take advantage of the statute, because he comes in by the limitation and act of the party. In Mod. 192, the report was reflected upon by Sergeant Maynard, who said there was no such resolution in the case of Lincoln College; but the Court said thst the report, whether there were any resolution in the case or not, was founded on so good reason that conveyances since had gone according to it. And in Glover r. Cope, 3 Lev. 326, it was rrtolved that a surrenderee of a copyhold is within the Act, contrary to a preceding resolution in Brasier v. Beal, Yelv. 222, founded on the ground of the surrenderee being in by the act of the lord.

In all these authorities it seems to be agreed that if in substance the estate was transmitted by the act and disposition of the party, he shall be considered as au assignee and grantee within the statute, although technically speaking the act of conveyance might not be strictly a grant or assignment—or in other words, that the right and obligation of the covenant followed the transmission of the estate without regard to the mode or character of the conveyance, and I am not aware of any authority in which the opposite doctrine is directly stateii—but in the late case of Roach and Wadham, which was argued very elaborately, upon the question whether a disposition operated as a grant of the estate or the execution of a power, it was completely assumed without argument or observation that the appointee 'under a power was net subject to the covenants of the appointor—of course no reference was made to the statute, and the case could not be brought within the immediate operation of it, being a conveyance in fee; but the several authorities which have been referred to do not proceed upon any minute verbal criticism on the language of the statute, but upon the broad general principle of the obligation following the disposition of the estate; and I should conceive that the case of a bargainee would be regarded as completely analogous to that of an appointee.

The justice of the case is very manifest, and it may be hoped that, without any disrespect towards those who were engaged in the agitation of the case referred to, a point of such importance would not be entirely laid at rest by a mere reference to their implied authority, without a more direct and ample consideration of the immediate question.

To the cases mentioned by Sir Edward Coke of a lord taking an estate by escheat who cannot have tfre benefit of the statute, may be added Lord Thre’r v. Barton, Moore, 94—Chaworth v. Phillips, Moore, 876, in which it was held that if a lessee make an underlease and surrender he in reversion cannot take the benefit of the condition, because he is in of another estate Paramount; —and in Webb v. Russell, 3 Term Repu 393, R was held that the grant of the reversion to the lessee extinguished die covenants of the sub-lessee —but it is very material to advert to the expressions in Moore, and that it is not merely that the party was in of another estate, but of another estate paramount. The point involves a question respecting leases made under powers with covenants to the lessor—in respect of which it is very evident that the party in reversion or remainder does not come in by any act or limitation of the party making the lease. The point was mentioned arguendo in Webb r. Russell, and I have known it occur in practice upon a case which went off upon other grounds.

[Since writing the present note it was determined in the case of Isherwood «. Oldknow, 3 M. and . 382, HR. 1815, B. R. after very full discussion at the bar, that a remainder man may maintain an action of covenant upon the covenant to the tenant for life in a lease made pursuant to a power.]

With respect to conditions at least, which are alway construed striedy, it seems very difficult to maintain that a condition that A, his heirs or assigns may re-enter, is to be taken advantage of by a party who by no posable extension on construction can be regarded as standing in either of those situations; and that it would be necessary expressly to give the benefit of the condition to such other persons to whom the reversion might belong, in which case, being ingrafted in the original power of leasing, it might hot be subject to the objection 1C

Class I.] Miscellaneous Statutes

against a condition being reserved to a stranger. *Thc whole of the subject last discussed seems very proper for the attention of the legislature, so as to place the matter perfectly upon the footing which is required by the justice and equity of the case. Probably in most of the cases a court of equity would feel itself competent to apply the necessary relief.

In Webb v. Russell, above referred to, the lease was made by the mortgager and the mortgagee of a term. The covenants were entered into with the mortgagor, and it was held that no action could be maintained upon them by the assignees of the mortgagee who had acquired the reversion vested in the mortgagor. The discussion of the case containsa great body of important learning upon the general subject of this note. In a subsequent case upon the same covenant it was held that die action might be maintained in the name of the original covenantee (the mortgagoi) as being a covenant in gross not affected by his alienation. Stokes v. Russell, 3 T. R. 678, affirmed on Writ of Error, 1 H. Bl. 562.

The decision in the case of the Mayor, &c. of Carlisle r, Blamire, 8 East, 487, already referred to, was that an action of covenant could not be brought against a person as assignee in respect of any equity of redemption, the legal fee being vested in another person as assignee not in possession.

The leading authority with respect to the distinctions between covenants that do or do not run with the land (or in other words which an heir or assignee are subject to or may uke the benefit of) is Spencer's Case, 5 Rep. 16 a, in which the following rules are laid down:—1. When a covenant extends to a thing in esse at the time of the demise the tl\ing to be done is in a manner annexed and appurtenant to the thing demised, and will bind the assignee although net named, as to repair the house demised. A covenant to build a wall upon the land demised will bind the assignees if named; but a covenant to do a collateral thing as to build a house on the land of theiessor will not.—3. A covenant with respect -to personal things demised with the land, as a flock of sheep, will not bind the assignee although named.

It is also held in Spencers case that a husband taking a term iu right of his wife a tenant, by statute merdiant or statute staple or elegit or a purchaser of a term under an execution, shall have the benefit of the covenants.

In Bally v, Wells, 3 Wils. 25, it was ruled that

concerning Real Estates. 205

a covenant by a lessee of tithes not to accept a composition binds the assignee, he being named. See also the full and elaborate judgment of ‘Lord Ch. J. Wilmot upon this Case in his own reports, p. 348. A covenant that the lessee his executors and administrators will reside upon the premises is binding upon the assignee, although not named. Tatem v, Chaplin, 2 H. Bl. 133.

A covenant to erect a mill and not to have any persons to work there who are not settled in the parish is personal, and does not bind the assignee. Mayor, Ac.c. of Congleton v. Pattison, 10 East 130. Upon covenant by the lessee to plant trees on land, and by the lessor for himself his heirs executors and administrators to pay for them at a fair valuation by two persons named, the assignee of the lessor not being named is not bound. Gray v. Cuthbertson. Selwyn N. P. 2 Ed. 445.

As to whether an assignee of the reversion can take advantage of a covenant not to assign. See Lomas v. How, Sir T. Raym. 250.

In Thursby v. Plant, 1 Saunders 237, it was held that the statute transferred the privity of contract from the lessor to his assignee, and that consequently an action by or against such an assignee is transitory as well as one between the lessor and lessee; but any action by or against the assignee of the lessee is local and can only be brought in the county where the land demised is situate, being in respect merely of privity of estate. See Stevenson v. Lambard, 2 East 575. Barker r. Darner, Carth. 182. Salk. 80; but a declaration laying the venue in another county is cured by verdict, Mayor of London v. Cole, 7 T. R. 583. In covenant again* an assignee it is sufficient to state that the premises came to defendant by assignment, and it is not ?ny variance if it should appear that he took them as heir. Derisley v. Custance, 4 T. R. 75, but a party tuing as assignee must specifically set forth his title. It may deserve consideration whether it might not be desirable to allow such an assignee to state his title generally in covenant, as may be done by statute in an avowry for rent.

If a tenant in tail make a lease not warranted by statute, and after hit death the lessee assign, the assignee cannot maintain an action on the covenant for quiet enjoyment, the estate to which the covenant was annexed having determined before his. interest commenced, and the right by estoppel not extending to such a case.

estates by lease for one or more life or lives, or ebe for years determinable u^on one or more life or lives; and it hath often happened, that 3

* such person or persons for whose life or lives such estates have been

* granted have gone beyond the seas, or so absented themselves for many years that the lessors and reversioners cannot find out whether such

* person or persons be alive or dead, by reason whereof such lessors and reversioners have been held out of possession of their tenements for many years, after all the lives upon which such estates depended are dead, in regard that the lessors and reversioners when they have brought actions for the recovery of their tenements have been put upon it to

* prove the death of their tenants, when it is almost impossible for them 1 to discover the same. '

II. For remedy of which mischief, so frequently happening to such lessors or reversioners, be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That if such person or persons, for whose bfb or lives such estates have been or shall be grauted as aforesaid, shall remain beyond the seas, or eleswhere absent themselves in this realm, by the space of seven year* together, and no sufficient and evident proof be made of the lives of such person or persons respectively, in any action commenced for recovery of such tenements by the lessors or reversioners; in every such case the person or persons upon whose life or lives such estate depended shall be accounted as naturally dead; and in every action brought for the recovery of the said tenements by the lessors or reversioners their heirs or assigns, the Judges before whom such action shall be brought shall direct the jury to give their verdict as if the person so remaining hevond the seas, or others ise absenting himself, were dead.

HI. And be it further enacted, That in any such action wherein the life or death of any such person or persons shall come in question between the lessor or reversioner and tenant in possession, k shall and may . be lawful for. the lessor or reversioner to take exception to any of the

IV. Provided always, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That nothing in this Act contained shall extend to any lands held by the life or lives of any person or .persons attainted of treason for the horrid murder of his late Majesty of blessed memory, who now conceal or hide themselves, which lands are or have been vested in his Majesty, and are now granted to his Royal Highness the Duke of York, but that the ooursc of evidence heretofore used in such cases shall be had and used; any thing.lo the contrary in this Act notwithstanding.

V. Provided always, and be it enacted, That if any person Of persons

Persons evicted shall be evicted out of any lands or tenements by virtue of this Act, and by this Act, the afterwards if such person or persons upon whose life or lives such estate " or estates depend, shall return again from beyond seas, or shall on proof

in any action to he brought for recovery of the same, be made appear to be living, or to have been living at the time of the eviction; that then and from thenceforth the tenant or lessee who was outed of the same, his or their executors administrators or assigns, shall or may re-enter re~possess have hold and enjoy the said lands or tenements in hie or their former estate, for and during tins life or lives, or so long, term as the said person or persons upon whoso life or lives the said estate or estates depend shall be living; and also shall, upon action or actions to be brought by him or them against the lessors reversioners or tenants in possession or other persons respectively, which since the time of the said eviction received the profits of the sakl lands or tenements, recover for damages the full profits of the said lands or tenements respectively, with lawful interest for and from the time that lie or they were outed of the same lands or tenements, and kept and held out of the same by the said lessors reverse* 6 Am skmers tenants or other persons, who after the said eviction received the c. 18. which ex- profits of the said lands or tenements or any of them respectively, as well tend* to Reversioner* after the Death of Minor* or married Women, 3111

endeavoured to be upheld by perjury and subornation of perjury; ’ i RoU.Abr.24. be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the-same. That from and after the four and twentieth day of June, which 2 Lev. 22/. shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred seventy and p*r°l Leases seven, all leases estates interests of freehold or terms of years, or any un- >nd interest of certain interest of in to or out of any messuages manors lands tenements Freehold shall or hereditaments, made or created by livery and seisin only, or by parol, ?r the force and not putin writing and signed by the parlies so making or creating the at

• The Statute of Frauds embraces a great variety of subjects that have no connection with each other, and many of which are in no degree .affected by the common object referred to in the title and preamble. There is no Act in the Statute Book to which, from the nature of its contents, it would be more difficult to assign an appropriate place in a collection like the present; and the Statute is introduced in this place in conformity with a principle which has, in a great measure, been suggested by its own very miscellaneous provisions of inserting Acts which embrace a variety of provisions applicable to different parts of the general division, under a common title, in the first class to which any one of the subjects so included may relate.

The Statute, although far from having met with universal approbation, has certainly received its full share of panegyric; and the language of extravagance ha3 even gone so far as to declare, that every line of it deserved a subsidy. The framing of it has been ascribed to Sir Matthew Hale; but apparently without any sufficient foundation.

The two leading provisions which require that the disposition of lands and certain personal contracts shall he evidenced by writing, signed by the party conveying or contracting, and that wills of land shall be attested by witnesses, are very useful and expedient—but are not distinguished by any great novelty of principle.

The language and composition of the Act have certainly no claim to particular commendation; and it is truly observed by Lord Mansfield, with respect to the clause concerning the attestation of wins, “that the whole clause which introduces a positive solemnity to be observed, not by the learned only, but by the unlearned, at a time when they are supposed to he without legal advice in a matter which greatly interests every proprietor of land, when the direction should be

plain to the meanest capacity, is so loose, that there is not a single branch of the solemnity defined or described with sufficient certainty to convey the same idea to the greatest capacity.”— Wyndham r. Chetwynd, 1 Bur. 418. It is cer-•tainly an Act which, next to those relating to the settlement of the Poor, has been productive of greater litigation in settling its construction thaiv any in the whole range of the Statutes, although the Annuity Act may be placed in competition with it In that respect" when considered with reference to the very limited nature of the subject to which it applies. It was stated by Mr. Barrington forty years ago to be a common notion in Westminster Hall, that it had not been explained at a less expence than 100,000l. But the laxity which has sometimes prevailed in the construction of it may share wirfi any imperfection of its own a considerable proportion of the imputation of that expence —a laxity which the opinions recently expressed concerning its operation have very generally condemned; and there can be no doubt that the permitting the exposition of an Act to be influenced by any opinions respecting its policy or utility, is not less repugnant to ge--neral convenience than to the maintenance of a due subordination of judicial interpretation to legislative authority.

2 Campb. 103.

(4) A cancelling is not a surrender within the Act. Roe r. Archb. of York, 6 East, 86. But a surrender of a lease for years may be made without deed, as where a mortgagee wrote on the mortgage deed M Received of A. B, for principal and interest, and I do release and discharge the within premises from the term of five hundred years.* This was holden to be a sufficient surrender, Parmer v. Rogers, 2 Wils. 26. A. being tenant from year to year, underlet the premises , to B., and the original landlord with the assent of A. accepted B. as his tenant, but there wis no surrender in writing of A.'s interest; rent being subsequently in arrear the landlord distrained on B.'s goods; and held that these circumstances constituted a valid surrender of A/s interest by set and operation of law.

Where a defendant taken on a ca. ad u. is discharged out of custody and consent of the plaintiff the debt itself is extinguished; and therefore a promise by a third person to pay that debt on condition of that discharge is an original promise, and not within the statute.

(7) Contract for purchase of a growing crop of grass to be mown and made into hay by the vendee, is a contract for an interest in land and within the statute, Crosby v. Wadsworth, 6 East, 602. So a sale ef growing turnips their maturity not being stated. Emmcrson v. Heelis, 2 Taunton, 38.— Sale of potatoes to be got immediately is not. Parker v. Staniland, 11 East, 362; and see accordingly Warwick v. Bruce, 2 M. and . 205. Plaintiff let defendant land to be paid a moiety of the crops in lieu of rent, an appraisement agreed to between the parties amounts to a case of goods sold and delivered, and is not within the statute, Poulter v. Killingbeck, 1 Bos. and Bull. 307, Plaintiff* agreed to accept A. B. as tenant upon defendant agreeing to pay plaintiff 40/., part of 100/. agreed to be paid by A. B.; the money being paid assumpsit lies for the 40/. the contract being executed, Griffith v. Young, 12 East, 513. A parol licence for an easement to the owner of adjoining premises is good and not within the statute. See Wood r. Lake, Say. 3. Winter r. Brockwell, 8 East, 308.

An equitable mortgage by deposit of title deeds was established in Russel v. Russel, 1 Bro. Ch. 269, and is now a matter of daily occurrence. This is mentioned in ex parte Finden, 11 Ves. 404 n. as the first case which broke in upon the statute, and let in evidence which it was the very object of the statute to exclude. But the doctrine although disapproved is not to be disturbed. Ex parte Haigh, 11 Vesey, 403. Norris i>. Wilkinson, 12 Ves. 197.

(8) This does not apply to contracts upon an event which may or may not happen within a year, as marriage, death, the arrival of a ship, Anon. Salk. 280, Peter v. Compton, Skinner, 353. Fenton r. Rmblers, 3 Burr. 1278. Where it appears by the facts of the case that the engagement was not intended to be performed within a year (as the subscription for BoydclTs Shakspeare) though part was performed in that time, the case is within the statute. Boy dell r. Drummond, 11 East, 142.

(9) The term agreement here seems ro import no more than promise or engagement, and was not considered as having any other construction until the well-known case of Wain r. Warlters, 5 East, 10, where from a fanciful derivation of the term agreement from agregalio mentium, it was decided that it imports something to be done on both sides, and that the consideration must appear upen the face of an instrument by which a person engages for the debt of another. In Stadt. t>. Lill, 9 East, 348, the consideration was held to be sufficiently

shewn in an agreement undertaking to guarantee the payment of any goods which A. might deliver to B. The decision in Wain v, Warlters is disapproved by Lord Eldon in ex parte Minet, 14 Vesey, 189, ex parte Gardom, 15 Vesey, 286, videetiam 1 B. and A.297, and it is a case which has been more disapproved by the profession, and is certainly more inconvenient in itself, than any decision of modem times. See the observations on the grounds of the decision in Fell's Treatise on Mercantile Guarantees. App. IV. In Bateman t>. Phillips, 15 East, 272, it was ruled that a letter to an attorney stating, u T trust you will give A. B. indulgence till next week, when I will undertake to see you paid, ” was a sufficient promise to pay the debt for which the attorney was employed to sue. See further Notes to Sec. 17, infra.

(10) The signature need rot necessarily be at the foot of the instrument; but the mere writing of the name of the party in the body of an instrument containing instructions for a lease, as “ A. B. to pay C. D., ” &c. being only applicable to a particular purpose and not intended as a signature is not sufficient, Stokes v. Moore, 1 Cox P. Wins. 771 N. So the altering a draft is not a signature, Hawkins t>. Holmes, 1 P. W. 770. See Sanderson v. Jackson, Note to $gc. 17, infra. Signature as a witness knowing the contents was held sufficient by Lord Hardwicke in Wilford t>. Beazely,

1 Wils. 118, 3Atk. 503. Sed. Qu. the question of a knowledge of the contents so as to attach to the fact of attestation, an effect and import which it does not bear upon the face of it, involves the subject in all the danger of parol evidence.

(11) A party who has himself signed the agreement cannot object that it is not signed by the other party, as is settled by a series of cases, from Mutton v. Gray, 2 Cha. Ca. 164, decided about seven years after the statute, to Scton v, Slade,

7 Ves. 265. This is a strong illustration of the principle that the writing required is the evidence and not of the essence of the contract.

(12) The authority of the agent need not be given in writing—Coles v. Trecothick, 9 Vesey, 234, 250, Clinan t>. Cooke, 1 Schoales and Lefroy, 22—but this is expressly required with respect to the subjects mentioned in Sec. 1. The clerk of an agent 4s not generally authorized to sign—but held sufficient in the particular case upon evidence of assent. Coles t>. Trecothick, ub. supra. See Mortlock v. Buller, 10 Ves. 292, in which under a power to trustees to sell at the request of A. B. a general consent of the trustees to sell was held not to constitute A. B. an agent for the trustees to enter into a contract. An authority to a steward to sell by auction does not authorize a sale by private contract.—Daniel v. Adams, Amb. 495. It wasruled in Walker r. Constable, 1 Bos. and P. 306,

214 Miscellaneous Statutes concerning Real Estates. [Part IL

that an auctioneer, upon a sale of land by auction, is not such an agent of both parties as to make his entry of the sale operate as a signature of the purchaser contrary to the doctrine established with respect to Sea. 17, as to sales of goods. See Lord Eldon's observations upon this subject in Coles v. Trecothick. Sec the observations of Sir William Grant, Buck master r. Harrop, 7 Vesey, 341, and of Lord Erskine upon appeal, 13 Vesey, 456, and the opinion of Sir Wm. Grant, Higginson r. Clowes, 15 Vesey, 51C.

In Emmerson v. Heelis, 2 Taunt. 38, it was decided that the writing down the name of the purchaser by the auctioneer is a signing by an agent for the purchaser, although for the sale of an interest in land—and this is confirmed by White v. Proctor, 4 Taunt. 209. It docs not seem to have been noticed, that at the time of writing down the name it is not intended as the record of a purchase, but only of a bidding.

(13) In addition to the preceding notes on this section, it will be proper to advert briefly to the following heads:

An agreement expressed by letter is sufficient. Moor r. Hart, 2 Ch. Rep. 1*47, 1 Vernon, 110. So a proposal by letter acceded to by parol.—Coleman r. Upcot, 5 Viner, 527. A proposal by letter for a daughter's portion, afterwards retracted and again agreed to by parol.—Bird v. B!os$c, 2 Vent. 361. A proposal at first refused but afte-vards consented to.-—Hodgson r. Hutchenson, 5 Viner, 522. This seems to be a»i incorrect decision, not merely with reference to the statute, but upon general principles — for in ordinary cases a proposal may be retracted at any rime before acceptance, and is no longer obligatory after actual refusal. Ruled, that a letter by the defendant to his daughter, whom the plaintiff1 courted, intimating that he had met the plaintiff and agreed to give him a portion, which letter was not communicated to the plaintiff, was not binding, being no more than a mere communication.—Ayliflfe r. Mr. Justice Tracy, 2 P. Wms. 65. See Wankford v. Fotherley, 2 Vem. 322.—Maxwell v. I.ady Mon-tacute, Free. Ch. 526, 1 P. Wms. 618.—Allan v. Bower, 3 Bro. Ch. 149.—Ludcre v. Anstey, 4 Vesey, 501—5 Vesey, 213. There is a difference between the 4th and 7th fcctions of the statute:the latter only requires th.it a trust shall be manifested by writing, nor that it shall be constituted by writing—and the former requires the very agreement to be in writing—Per Sir William Grant, in Randall v. Morgan, 12 Ves. 67.

A letter or other paper duly signed, clearly referring to another paper which contains the terms of the agreement, is sufficient—Tawney r. Crowther, 3 Bro. Ch. 161, 3IP, but there must be an actual reference; and an agreement for a lease not specifying a definite term, or referring to an advertisement in which such term was expressed, cannot be connected with the advertisement by parol t vide nee.—Clinan «*. Cooke, . & L. 22. *The cases of Seagood v. Meale, Prec. Ch.* 560 — Clerk r. Wright, 1 Atk. 12—Whaley ?*. Bagsnal, 1 Bro. P. C. 345—and also Clinan r. Cooke, decide that a letter referring to an agreement, but not specifying the terms of it, is not sufficient.

In Brodie v. St. Paul, 1 Vesey, jun. 326, it was held, that a reference in an agreement to such parts of another paper as had been read to the party was not sufficient.

An alteration of an agreement relating to a sub* ject within the statute is as much affected by the statute as original agreement, and requires the same solemnities.

Sufficient attention has not always been ptid in this respect to the distinction between cases where writing was necessary from the nature of the subject, and those in which.it had only been accidentally resorted to in the original agreement.— See Cokes v. Mascal, 2 Vem, 34.—Jordan v. Saw-kins, 1 Ves. jun. 402.—Rich v. Jackson, £ Bro. Ch. 514. —Robson r. Collins, 7 Vesey, 130. The disallowance of parol evidence, to shew that other terms not expressed were intended to perform part of a written agreement, does not depend so much upon the statute as upon the general rule of law, that parol evidence' cannot be admitted to vary the terms of an agreement.—See upon this subject the distinction between cases of a plaintiff requiring the pefbrmance of an agreement different from that expressed, and those of a defendant resisting performance on the ground of fraud or surprise.— Young v. Clark, Prec. Ch. 538.—Legal r. Miller,

2 Vesey, 376.—Buxton v. Lister, 3 Atk. 383.— Shirley v. Srratton, 1 Bro. Ch. 440—Stadgroom r. Marquis of Townsend, 6 Vesey, 328.—Clarke r. Grant, 14 Vesey, 519.— Higginson v. Clowes,

15 Vesey, 516. See also Price v. Dyer, 17 Vesey, 356, in which the original agreement was enforced, notwithstanding a subsequent parol agreement to add other terms in favour of the defendant.

In this case most of the authorities upon the subject are referred to.

For cases of decreeing performance of an agreement not conformable to the statute on the ground of fraud, see Cooke v. Mascal, 2 Vem,

34 and 200.—Mallet r. Halfpenny, cited Pr. Ch. 404.

For case* in which a person who has dissuaded another from making or altering his will, upon an engagement to comply with h» intention, has been compelled to perform such engagement, see Lhamhcrlaine r. Chamberlainc, 2 Frecm. 34,

2 Eq. Ca. :*b. 43, Prec. Ch. 4.—Devenish r. Baines, Prec. Ch. 3.—Oldham v. Litchford, 2 Vem. 506.

—Reech r. Keneg.il, 1 Vesey, 123.—Barrow r. Greenough, 3 Vesey, jun. 152.

It is a well known exception, which Courts of Equity have introduced in the construction of the statute, that the benefit of it shall not be taken against an agreement which ha* been in part performed; and Buller, J. in Brodie r. St. Paul,

1 Vesey, jun. 333, intimated an opinion that the same rule would prevail at law—but the contrary opinion was strongly expressed by Lord Eldon, in Cooth v. Jackson, 6 Vesey, 29. The inclination of Courts of Equity, in modem cases, has been rather to narrow than to extend the doctrine of part performance.

It is clearly settled, that giving directions for . conveyances and going to view the estate, are not Acts of part performance.

Manage is also clearly not such a performance V

V. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from No. XVIL and after the said four and twentieth day of June all devises and bequests - ~ of any lands or tenements devisable either by force of the statute of wills or by this statute, or by force of the custom of Kent, or the custom of any c- 3* borough or any other particular custom, (14) shall be in writing* and suneu (15) by the party so devising the same, or by some other person D^vige* of in his presence and by his express directions, and shall he attested and lands shall be in writing, and attended by three or four witnesses. 3 Lev. 86. Carthew 35, 514. 3 Mod. 218. 262.

as takes an agreement in consideration of it out of the statute.

It seems to be now settled, that payment of part of the purchase-money is not such a performance as takes a case out of the statute.—See Buckmas-ter v. Harrop, 7 Vesey, 341. Sir William Grant there said, that even if payment of the auction duty could be considered as a part of the price, he . did not see how that could bind the purchaser. In general the party selling must shew a performance on his side, as a reason for the interference of the court in his favour—for the ground upon which the court acts is fraud, in refusing to perform after the performance of the other party. In Clinan v. Cooke, 1 Sch. & Lcf. 22, 40, Lord Rcddesdale held, that the payment of money was not a part performance—and said, that he took it that nothing would be a part performance, which does not pur the party into a situation that would be a - fraud upon him, unless the agreement was performed. Taking possession by a purchaser and cutting crops is part performance.—Buckmaster v. Harrop, on appeal, 13 Vesey, 456. A tenant's continuing in possession upon alleged new agreement, is not.—Frame v. Dawson, 14 Vesey, 386. In that case Sir Wm. Grant said, “ Part performance must be an act unequivocally referring to and arising out of the agreement, and such that the party would suffer an injury amounting to fraud by the refusal tff execute the agreement/' He also considered it an objection to a specific performance, that the Act in question was such as would easily admit of compensation without executing the agreement. See the observations of Lord Redesdale as to the relaxations of the statute.—Lyndsay v. Lynch, 2 Sch. & Lef. 5.—See, as to part performance, the note to Pym v. Black-burne, 3 Vesey, 34. As tt difficulties which may occur, when the defendant admits the acts alleged as part performance, but denies the agreement in respect of which they are alleged to be performed, tee Foublanque's Notes on Treatise of Equity, B. 1, Ch. 3, \ 8.

If a Defendant deny that any parol agreement ever took place, a court of equity will not inquire into the truth of that denial.—Per Lord Eldon, Cooth v. Jackson, 6 Vesey, 12. Where a plaintiff had built a house, his v itness proved an agreement different from that of the kill, and the answer stated an agreement different from both, the Lord Chancellor said, that in strictness the bill ought to be dismissed-—but, on account of the expenditure, decreed specific performance of the agreement admitted by the answer, with costs against the plaintiff.—Mortimer r. Orchard, 2 Ves. jun. 243. But in Woollam v. Hearn, 7 Vesey, 211. Lyndsey r. Lynch, 2 Sch. and Lef. 1, the plaintiff having failed in establishing the agreement insisted upon, the Court would not decree the agreement admitted, but dismissed the bill without prejudice to filing a fresh bill.

It is settled, that if a defendant, by answer ad* mits the agreement stated in the bill, and does not* insist upon the statute, performance will be decreed; but whether he is bound to admit or deny the parol agreement, so that the effect of the statute is only to exclude evidence aliunde—whether he must take advantage of the statute, by way of plea—or, whether admitting the agreement be may insist upon the statute, by way of answer, are points not absolutely settled.—See Cottington Fletcher, 2 Atk. 155.—Lacon v. Mcrtins, 3 Atk. 4* — Rondeau v. Wyatt, 2 H. Bl. 63.—Eyre v. Ivison, cited 2 Bro. Ch. 563.—Stewart t?. Careless, ib. 565.—Moore r. Edwards, 4 Vesey, 23.— Whitchurch v. Bevis, 2 Br. Ch. 559. It seems, however, to be the prevalent opinion, that it is sufficient to claim the benefit of the statute by the answer—see Cooth v. Jackcon, 6 Vesey, 12—but if the defendant dees not insist upon the statute, in the answer to the original bill, he cannot do so in the answer to the amended bill, id. and Spurrier v, Fitzgerald, 6 Vesey, 548.

* This statute is in force in the island of St, Kitts, 4 M. Sc . 1.

(14) The statute does not extend to copyholds surrendered to the use of a will, nor to devises in execution of a power—but a power to appoint by will generally is held to mean, with respect to lands, a will conformable to the statute.—See Sugden on Powers, c. 5, § 3. A person cannot create a power to devise by his own will, otherwise than according to the statute.— Habergham v, Vincent, 2 Vesey, jun. 204.

A term of years is not within the statute, unless attendant upon the inheritance, in which case it is not severed by a will not duly attested.—Whitchurch r. Whitchurch, 2 P. Wms. 236.

A Will duly attested, charging legacies on lands, extends to legacies given by an attested codicil— Brudenelle v. Boughton, 2 Atk. 258, vi.—-8 Vesey, 495—but it must be a general legacy, and not a specific charge, which cannot be made by an unattested codicil, under a power expressed for the purpose in a regular attested will.—Rose v. Cunynghame, 12 Vesey, 29.

(13) In some or the older cases, sealing was held a sufficient signing; but in Ellis r. Smith, in Chan. 1754, reported 1 Ves. jun. 11, the contrary opinion was expressed by Parker, C. B. Willes, C. J. and Sir John Strange, M. R. who assisted the Lord Chancellor. The same opinion was expressed by Lord Eldon, in Wright v. Wakefield, 17 Ves. 459. Writing the name at the top may be a sufficient signing.- -Ltmaine r. Stanley,

An attestation with a mark is sufficient. v. Harrison, 8 Vesey, 185, 504. The witnesses may attest at different times. — Cook v. Parsons, Prec. Ch. 186.—Jones v. Lake, 2 Atk. 176.

(17) This clause does not require the will to be signed by the testator in the presence of the witnesses, out only that it shall be attested by the witnesses in the presence of the testator— - whereas the next clause, as to revocation, requires the signature in the presence of the witnesses, but not the attestation of the witnesses in the presence of the testator. It is sufficient if the testator might see the witnesses attest, and not necessary that he actually should do so—ss when the testator was in a carriage, and the attestation in a house, it being sworn that the testator might see what passed.*—See Coeson r. Dade, 1 Bro. Ch. 99.— Shires e. Glascock, 2 Salk. 638. But where the attesting witnesses retired from the room, where the testator had signed, and subscribed their names in an adjoining room, and the jury found that from one part of the testator's room a person, by inclining himself forwards with his head out of the door, might have seen the witnesses, but that the testator was not in such a situation that he could have Men them by so inclining, the will was held to be not duly attested.-—Doe deni. Wright v. Manifold, 1M4S. 294. If the testator is in a state of insensibility at the time of the attestation, such attestation is void.—Right v. Price, Doug. 241. The rule of the civil law.

(19) It is by force of these words, that a will of not duly attested, is not sufficient even to put

the heir to hit election, with respect to personal

estate.—See, the case ex-parte the Earl of Ilchester, 7 Vesey, 348, 372.—See also the observations on Thelluson v. Woodford, 13 Vesey, 223. A wish has been often expressed by great authorities, that all testamentary acts should be rendered subject to the solemnities required by the statute; and certainly the importance of such a provision is extremely evident, when it is considered Kow much the intentions of a testator may be defeated by a will which is founded on one arranged plan, being partly good and partly void. The uncertainty as to what shall or shall not constitute a sufficient manifestation of the will, with respect to personal estate, is also extremely inconvenient, and a great source of litigation.—-See the observations of Lord Loughborough on this subject, Matthews r. Warner,

4 Vesey, 186.

(20) As to wills of land in the plantations, see Star. 25 G. II. c. 6, post title Wills.

(21) A beginning to cancel under the impression that a new will is complete, and desisting upon being; . informed to the contrary, is no revocation. Hyde v. Hyde, 1 Eq. Abr. 409. So a cancellation upon making a new will which is invalid by reason of the witnesses not attesting in the presence of the testator. Onyons v. Tyrer, Prec. Ch. 459.—

1 P. Wms. 344. Con. Ed.—Throwing the will into the fire with intent to destroy it is sufficient, though it falls off and i• preserved. Bibb. r. Thomas, 2 Bl. Rep. 1043. The obliteration of a part is only a revocation as to that part. Sutton v. Sutton, Cowp. 812. Striking out the name of one joint-tenant has the effect of leaving the entire estate in the other. Aliter as to tenants in common who cannot thereby acquire an estate not originally given. Larkins r. Larkins, 3 Bos. & P. 16, 109. See also as to the first point. Short r.

A cancellation of the one part is a revocation of duplicates. Eurtenshaw v, Gilbert, Cowp. 49. See Pemberton v. Pemberton, 13 Vt^ev, 290. In that case the testator made dupli-eates of I«i: will, and afterwards altered, and subset quently cancelled one part—-the one part uncancelled, and the other altered and cancelled, and a codicil without a date, were found in his possession at his death—and a verdict in favour of the will was sustained.—The immediate decision was on the fact of an intention to cancel, but the legal doctrines are very fully gone into.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from c* and after the said four and twentieth day of June, all declarations or creations of trusts or confidences of any lands tenements or hereditaments, Declan-shall be manifested and proved (20) by some writing signed by the party tioator Creations of trusts shall be in writing. Explained by 4XXAnne, c. 16. section, 15, Port.

(22) A subsequent will of lands is only a revocation so far as the dispositions are inconsistent.-— Coward v. Marshall. Cro. Elia. 721. A finding that the testator afterwards made another will of which the^contents are unknown—or that the testator made a subsequent will different from the firstKbut in what particular is unknown, and that it does not appear what became of the second will, is not sufficient to revoke the first.-—Hungerford c. Noaworthy, Sho. P.C. 146.—Hutchins t>. Bassett, Salk. 592.—Harwood v. Goodright, Cowp. 87.*— 7 Bro. P. C. 8vo. 489.

A will with a clause of revocation conformable to this section, being signed by the testator in the presence of the witnesses, but not valid as a will, not being attested in the presence ef the testator, is not a revocation, not being intended for such as an independent act.-—See Onyons v. Tyrer, supra No. 21.—Egglertone v. Speake, 3 Mod. 258.— 1 Sho. 89.

It is to be observed, however, that in those cases the substantial dispositions were the same in both wills, as to the materiality of which vi. ex parte the Earl of Hchester, 7 Ves. 373.

(23) A will acknowledged as such in the presence of three witnesses, is good—and although not signed in their presence, a sufficient revocation—and, though being a devise to an heir at law, void as a will, is a valid instrument of revocation, being executed according to the statute.— Ellis r. Smi:h, 1 Vesey, jun. 11.

(24) A declaration of the testator, certified by three witnesses, but not signed by him, that he revokes his will, is void.—Hilton r. King, 3 Lev. 86.

(25) It is completely settled, that the provisions of this section do not extend to revocations by operation of law, such as a subsequent marriage and the birth of a child.—See Doe on the demise of Lancashire r. Lancashire, 5 T. R. 49— in which this was decided, in respect to a posthumous child, and the doctrine considered as resting rather upon a tacit condition than upon an implied revocation; but it may be qualified by circumstances where the subsistence of the will is not inconsistent with the new relations which are contracted.—See Brady r. Cubitt, Doug. 39, and more particularly Kenebel r. Scrafton, 2 East. 530—in which a testator made provisions in favour of the children that he should have by A. B. with whom he then cohabited and afterwards married and had children by; a total want of provision for the family so newly constituted being considered as the basis of the tacit condition—and see ex-parte the Earl of Ilchester, 7 Vesey, 348, which related to the revocation of a testamentary appointment of a guardian, referred to in note to Stat. 29 Ch. II. c. 24, ante Nfe 15.

The case upon this subject contained in the additional note (a) infra, has already been published by the Editor, in a note to Lugg v. Lugg,

2 Salk. 592.

That a tacit revocation by subsequent marriage and birth of child without provision, can be rebutted by parol evidence, is affirmed per Cur. Lord Raymond, 441, Doug. 31—per Eyre, 2 H.

Blaciest. 522; negatived per Lord Alvanley, 4 Ves. jun. 848—Lord Rosslyn, 5 Ves. jun. 664.

The doctrine of revocation by an alteration of the estate, is referred to in note to 32 H. VI1L c. 1, post title wills, No. 1.

The cases respecting the republieation of wills chiefly relate to the rule, that a will as to real estate can only operate upon the land which the testator has at the time of the execution—and establish, 1st. That a republieation of a will gives it the same effect as if originally made at the time of the republieation—see Marten v. Savage,

1 Ves. 440—and 2d, That a codicil confirming a will gives effect to the whole will, as if made at the time of publishing the codicil, whether the codicil be annexed to the will or not, —see Acher* ley r. Vernon, Com. R. 381, 3 Bro. P. C. 107— Barnes r. Crowe, 1 Vesey, jun. 486, 4 Bro. Ch. 2 — Piggott t*. Waller, 7 Vesey, 98, —except the expressions of the will or codicil are of so qualified a nature as to require a different construction.— Strathmore r. Bowes, 7 T. R. 482—2 Bos. Si Pull. 500.—Holmes r. Coghill, 7 Ves. 499.— Lane r. Wilkins, 10 East, 24*2. The cancelling a second will revives the firit, which was thereby revoked—Goodright v. Glazier, 4 Bur. 2512—but if one part of a will, of which there are duplicates, be cancelled at the time of making the second, the other duplicate then not being in the testator’s possession, the first is not revived by cancelling the second.—Burtenshaw v. Gilbert, Cowp. 49— and see Pemberton v. Pemberton, mentioned In note 21.

(26) The fuUe.it information as to the principle which has been adopted with respect to the construction of this clause, is to be derived from the case of Forster r. Hale, 3 Vesey, 696j in which it was held, that an agreement for one person to be s trustee for others might be made out by letters, in which he admitted himself to be such—and that, according to the true meaning of the statute, it is sufficient if it appears in writing, under the hand of a person having a power to declare himself a trustee, which i3 equivalent to a formal declaration of trust. The Master of the Rolls, (Sir R. P. Arden,) observed, that it ia not required that the trust should be created in writing, and the words of this clause are very particular it does not by any means require that all trusts should be created only by writing—but that

VIII. Provided always, That where any conveyance shall be made of any lands or tenements by which a trust or confidence shall or may arise or result by tho implication or construction of law, or be transferred or extinguished by an Act or operation of law, then and in every such case such trust or confidence shall be of the like force and effect as the same would have been if this statute had not been made; any thing herein before contained tc the contrary notwithstanding. (‘*7)

IX. And be it further enacted, That all grants and assignments of any trust or confidence shall likewise be in writing signed by the party granting or assigning the same, or by such last will or devise, or else shall likewise be utlei ly void and of none effect.

X. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said four and twentieth day of June, it shall and may be lawful for every sheriff or other office r to whom any writ or precept is or shall be directed, at the suit of any person or persons, of for and upon any judgment statute or recognizance hereafter to be made or had, to do make and deliver execution unto the party in that behalf suing of all such lands tenements rectories tithes rents and he reditaments, as any other person or persons be in any manner of wise seised or possessed or hereafter shall be seised or possessed in trust for him against whom execution is so sued, like as the sheriff or other officer might or ought to have done, if the said party against whom execution hereafter shall be so sued, had been seised of Mich lands tenements rectories tithes rents or other hereditaments of such estate as they be seised of in trust for him at the time of the said execution sued; (28) which lands tenements rectories tithes rents and other hereditaments by force and virtue of such execution, shall accordingly be held and enjoyed freed and discharged from all incumbrances of

they shall be manifested and proved by writing, plainly meaning that there should be evidence in writing proving that there was such a trust. He admitted that it must be proved in toto, not only that there was a trust, hut what it was. In the particular case, his Honor, from several letters and papers, inferred an agreement, that the lessee of a colliery took it on account of himself and other persons with whom he was engaged in partnership.— See also Randall r. Morgan, 12 Vesey, 73, 74.

(27) The most common case of trusts by operation of law is where an estate is purchased by one man and the purchase-money paid by another.— See the cases referred to in Forster t% Hale, mentioned in the last note. Where a person purchased an estate in his own name, and insisted in answer to a kill alledging that it was made by him as agent for the plaintiff, that it was made cii his own account; Lord Northington refused to permit parol evidence of the agency in opposition to the defendant's answer, but said, that if the plaintiff had paid any money, it would have been a reason with him to admit the evidence. The defendant was afterwards convicted of perjury upon his denial of the trust, and a petition was presented to the Lord Chancellcr for leave to Me a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of revivor, stating this conviction, but the petition was dismissed. Bartlett r. Pickersgill, cited East, 577.

The general preemption that where a conveyance is made to one person and the purchase money paid by another, the former is a trustee for the latter, is rebutted in the case of a purchase

made by a father in the name of his child, which is, prima facia, an advancement, even in case of a copyhold, where the custom is to grant to three for their lives successive, and the name of the child is inserted as one of those lives, but the presumption on either side may be rebutted by circumstances or parol evidence.—See the subject very particularly examined in the case of Dyer v. Dyer, in the Exchequer, 1 Watkins on Copy-holds, 216.—Sec also Rider v, Kidder, 10 Vesey, 360.—Finch t% Finch, 15 Vesey, 48.

Where a trustee purchases lands with the trust money and takes a conveyance in his own name, a trust will result and evidence may be given aliunde, that the purchaser as made with trust money, although denied by the defendant’s answer.—Balgrey r. Balgrey, and Ryal r. Ryal, cited in Lane r. Dighton, Ambler 409.—See upon this subject Percy r. Philips, 4 Vesey, 108, in which it was held there were not sufficient circumstances to induce the presumption that the purchases were made in execution of the trust.—-See also Foublanque’s Notes, Treatise of Equity, B. 11. c. 5, s. 1.

(28) If*the trustee convey lands after judgment and before execution to a purchaser without notice, the land cannot be taken in execution-— Hurst v. Coles, Comyns 226.—Higgins t*. Yor Buildings Comp. 2. Atk. 1C7. Query, Whether the land is liable in case the purchaser has notice.—See Sugden on Venders and Purchasers, Ch. 9. on Searching for Incumbrances. A conveyance in trust to sell and pay $}ebts, and the surplus to the grantor, is not a trust within the Statute.—Ibid.

XI. Provided always, That no heir that shall become chargeable by reason of any estate or trust made assets in his hands by this law, shall by reason of any kind of plea or confession of the action or suffering judgment by Nieut dedire or any other matter be chargeable to pay the condemnation out of his own estate; but execution shall be sued of the whole estate so made assets in his hands by descent, in whose hands soever it shall come after the writ purchased, in the same manner as it is to be at and by the common law, where the heir at law pleading a true pica judgment is prayed against hii\i thereupon; any tning in this present Act contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

XII. And for the amendment of the law in the particulars following; he it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from henceforth any estate pur autre vie shall l»e deviseable by a will in writing signed by the party so devising the same, or by some other person in his presence and by his express directions, attested and subscribed in the presence of the devisor by three or more witnesses; and if no such devise thereof be made, the same shall be chargeable in the hands of the heir if it shall come to him by reason of a special occupancy, as assets by descent, as in case of lands in fee-simple; and in case there be no special occupant thereof, it shall go to the executors or administrators of the party that had the estate thereof by virtue of the grant, and shall be assets in their hands.

II. c. 20, sec. 9, after reciting this section, and that doubts had arisen where no devise had been made of such estates, to whom the surplus after the debts of such deceased owners thereof are fully satisfied should belong, it is enacted that such es*ates pour autre vie, in case there be no special occupant thereof, of which no demise shall have been made according to this Act, or so much thereof as shall not have been so devised shall go to, be applied and distributed in the same 'manner as the personal estate of the testator or intestate.

There was no general occupancy at common law of a copyhold, and therefore these Statutes do not extend to such. Touch, deni—Foise v. Foise, 7 East, 186. Although there was no general occupancy of a rent at common law it seems to be within the Statutes.—Rawlinson v. the Duchess of Montague, 3 P. W»i. 261, u. Kendal v. Micfield, Barnard Ch. 46. In Oldham r. Pickering, 2 Salk, 464, it was ruled in prohibition that the Statute of Frauds only made estates pur autre vie assests for the purpose of paying debts, and not for the purpose of distribution, but

in Witter r. Witter, 3 P. Wins. 101, they were held to be distributable in Chancery.—Any question upon this point is removed by StaL 14, Geo. II.—In Ripley v. Waterworth, 7 Vesey 423, it was held on much discussion that an estate pur autre vie limited to executors administrators and assigns, was applicable to the residuary legatees of the testator under a will not attested by three witnesses, although devisable only as to the legal estate by a will so attested.—Upon a limitation in a lease for lives to heira executors administrators and assigns the interest goes to the heir.—Atkinson t*. Baker, 4 T. R. 229. 1 have seen opposite opinions of Mr. Fearoe and Lord Kenyon as to the case of premises held under a lease for lives, to the lessee his heirs and assigns, devised by him without words of limitation, and the right to which was disputed between the heir and personal representative of the devisee.—The opinion of Lord Kenyon was, that the personal representative was entitled, which teems evidently correct, as there was no desigiustio person* of the heir of the devisee, wherefore the case is that of there being no rpeeial occupant, so that by the Statute of frauds the estate devolves on the executors.

(32) It was determined soon after the passing of this Act, that it was only made to assist a purchaser, and that it left the party to the suit as he was at Common Law.—Skin. 257, which was recognised by Lord Hardwicke, 2 Eq. ca. ah. 381, and per Curiam Hutchinson v. Johnson, I. T. R. 729. A judgment signed in any part of the term, or the subsequent vacation, relates back to the first day of the term notwithstanding the death of the defendant before judgment actually signed, and an execution against the goods of the defendant may be taken out upon it tested the first day of the term.—Bragner v.

Comber, 1 H. Bl. 20.—Rondeau v. Wyatt, 2 H. Bt. 63— Cooper v. Elston, 7 T. R. 14.; but the decisions in Towers v. Osborne and Clayton v.

(36) The Court of Common Pleas, in Sanderson v. Jackson, 2 B. and P. 238, seemed to think the printed title of a bill of parcels, u Mr. — bought of Jackson and Hankin, ” a sufficient signature—but at all events, that a letter from the defendant, the seller, to the plaintiff, wishing to know when the order should be delivered, took the case our of the Statute, on the ground that the jury had connected the letter with the bill of parcels. But surely, with regard to the first point, to use, with a slight variation, the terms of the Chief Baron, in Stokes v. Moore, referred to supra (note 10) a name inserted at the [top] of an instrument, and applicable to particular purposes, could not be intended to be such an authentication as the Statute required. As to the second point, although the letter referred tothe contract, it seems very doubtful whether it was intended to refer to the particular written evidence of the terms of such contract; and it could not be collected from the letter itself, that there was any other writing io which a reference louldbe made. The point does not appear to have been distinctly put to the jury, and as this part of the case u wholly decided upon the foundation of the jury having found such reference, the case, as an authority, amounts to no more than that the evidence in questioo was such as it was proper to leave to the jury, upon the point whether the reference to the

previous writing was intended or not-—and As to the cases decided with reference to this principle, upon sect. 4, see the notes to that section *. A note signed by the seller in the plaintiffs (the buyer's) memorandum book, not mentioning the plaintiff’s name, is not (nifficient.—Champion v. Plumber, 1 N.

Smith, 15 East. 103.

(37) In Simon v. Metivier, mentioned supra note 34, it was held that an auctioneer was agent to both parties? and that his setting down the name of the seller was sufficient to take the case out of the Statute; and the court were strongly inclined to think, that sales by auction were not within the Statute, but that as a general proposition cannot be sustained, as appears by several of the cases mentioned in the preceding notes to this section—but the doctrine of the entry of the sale by the auctioneer, being a contract signed by him as agent for both parties, is established.— Emmerson r. Heelis, 2 Taunton, 38.—See Hind* v. Whitehouse, 7 East. 569. cited supra note 34.— See also the esses upon this subject as affecting sales of land, ante note 14.

(a) See Notes to Sec. 6. supra.—The following Note relative to this subject was taken by the Editor:

M 6th May, 1793. In the Prerogative Court* u Wright against Net he* wood.

£&" A. makes a will leaving some legacies and appointing his wife residuary legatee; she died leaving several children. He married again, and had one child by his second wife. Afterwards A. with his wife and ail hit children perished by shipwreck. The will is not revoked.] This case arose on a question, Whether the

will of George Netherwood deceased, was or was not revoked?

On the 24th June 1783, the deceased married Elisabeth Lomax, spinster. On the 8th of October following he made his will, whereby be charged his real estate with the payment of debts and legacies, if bis personal should be deficient. He gave sane pecuniary and specific legacies, and bequeathed (be residue of his portmui estate to Ms wife by her maiden name, Elisabeth Lomax, and devised the real aetata to her for life, remainder to one Joseph Netherwood j ha appoimad Wright, the party. yjOUVlv

Class 1.] Miscellaneous Statutes concerning Real Estates. 223

executor of his effects in England, and another executor for his effects in the West Indies.

Afterwards Elisabeth died, leaving several children by her husband. The testator married the sister of his former wife, and had issue by her one eon.

“ The said George Netherwood embarked for England from Jamaica, with his wife her son and all the children by the farmer marriage. The ahip in which they embarked was never afterwards heard ef, and waa admitted to be lost.

w The will was proved by the executor in England in common form, and he was afterwards cited by the next of kin of the deceased to prove it in solemn form, or shew cause why it should not be declared invalid.

u The facts were admitted on both sides to be as above stated,

M By the inventory the property of the deceased appeared to amount to about 800i)L The legacies amounted to rather more than 200L

u Sir William Scott and Dr. Xicholl in support of the will.—1The will in this case was not revoked by the second marriage and the birth of a child; for although it may be admitted as a general principle that these circumstances do revoke a will, on the presumption that upon such a total alteration of circumstances the testator did not continue to have the same intentions; that presumption is liable to be repelled by circumstances. If it appears to be his intention that the will should stand, marriage and the birth of a child will not destroy it.

“ AU presumptive revocations are stricii Juris, and must be wholly inconsistent with the deceased's intention to dispose of his property according to the wUL

“ The general principle of these revocations is, that when person has contracted such new obligations and relations, it cannot be supposed that he meant to adhere to his former disposition. That principle is recognised by all the cases upon the subject, and they all proceed upon the ground of a total alteration in the testator’s circumstances; hut if there is not a total alteration, the implication is repelled.

“ No case can be stronger against a revocation than this. When he was married he made a will, by which he bequeathed some small legacies, tod disposed of the rest of his property to his wife. This might be in confidence that she would take care of any children he should have by her. The wife diet, and the residue becomes lapsed. He marries again, and hit fortune will take the same cetirse in point of substance as if he had made no will. The few legacies will belong to the persons to whom they were given, and the residue would be subject to the statute of distribution.

“ There are cases in which it has been held, that this alteration of circumstances did not amount to a revocation; where the alteration was not such as to make the court say, the testator could not in duty adhere to his will. Such was the case of Brown end Thompson, 1 Eq. Ca. Ab. 413, where it was held that the alteration of circumstances was not sufficient to amount to a revocation; for so injury was done aay person, and those whom

the testator was bound to provide for were taken care of (Vide the observations of Buller, J. upon this opinion, in Doe r. Lancashire; ) the great bulk would go to the wife and children; all the new relations are fully satisfied; and there is no probability of the testator’s not intending to adhere to his former disposition. In Brady t>. Cubitr, Doug. 31—33, it is said by Lord Mansfield, 4 That upon his recollection there eras no case in which marriage and the birth of a child have been held to raise an implied revocation, where there has not been a diposition of the whole estate/ And although that may not be cmemial, it is certainly very material. Presumed revocations may exist where the residue is very small, but it is otherwise where s small part only is disposed of, and the bulk remains. In Thompson and Shepherd, mentioned in.a note to Amb. 490, it was held that marriage and having children did not amount to a revocation of a will made by a widower who had children. It was not that complete alteration of circumstances which implies the revocation of a declared intention. A case of Calder and CaMtr, lately decided in the Prerogative Court, does not apply. U depended on its ewn circumstances; and there was no power to presume that the testator adhered to his intention. That was the case of s will made by a widower having no children; he had no view to the relations of husband and father. The great bulk of his property was left away, and there were declarations shewing his idea that his property would go to his wife and children upon a marriage subsequent to the will; and the will itself was such as would involve the family in endless litigation. Every circumstance in that case raised the implication, that the will should be revuked. No such circumstances exist in this case; but, cti the contrary, every circumstance repels the implication.

“ There would be a very considerable provision for the wife and her child; and it must be presumed that be knew the operation of the will; that it disposed of the small legacies according to hia intention; that the residue would be distributable according to law; and that hia property would be managed by the respective persons in

whom he had reposed a confidence for the pur____ »> pose.

The advocates for the plaintiff hiving here closed their arguments, the Judge intimated a wish that the case might be considered upon another point, viz. Whether the will (provided k was revoked; did not revive, as the son by the second wife did not survive his father ? For which purpose, it stood over till the 13th of May; when the advocates before-mentioned signed on that point.

In cases where it cannot be actually ascertained whether the parent or the eon survived, and they perished by the same stroke of death, according to the Roman law, it was presumed that if the son had not obtained the age of pu* berty, the father survived; but if the son had attained that age, that he survived the father. This presumption arises from the degree of strength supposed to belong to the respective parties. It was liable to certain exceptions in behalf

224 Miscellaneous Statutes concerning Real Estates. [Part II.

of claims favoured by that law for the interest of r. Lancashire, 5 T.H 49, 61, thought the opr *

mothers, and in cases of fiduciary bequests, and the rights of patronage. The general rule of presumption being applied to the present case, the child by the second wife being only about a year old, must be taken to have died before his father. The question then arises, whether the will, if it was before revoked, was revived by the circumstance of the father surviving ?

a By the Roman law, a will which was revoked by the birth of a posthumous child, did not revive by his death, because no change in the father's intention can in that case be presumed; but it was held otherwise with respect to the quasi post-fount, or those who were bom after the will was made in the testator's lifetime. On their death the will was restored by the praetorian law, as upon a new designation of intention.

<* There b no case where it has been held by the law of England, that, under these circumstances, a presumptive revocation does take place. There are two points of time to be regarded in considering the effect of the will: 1st, The Paction:2d, The Consummation. The will was undoubtedly good when it was made. Was it otherwise at the death of the testator ? The presumption of the law of England with respect to revocations, b not more strong than the Agnatio sui hartdis by the civil law, nor so strong, for that was an actual revocation, and the other b only a presumption liable to be repelled. The removal of the cause will as strongly imply a renewal of the first intention, or rather more strongly, on account of the omission to destroy the will; but by the praetorian civil law it was held, that upon the death of the Agnatus the will was restored. It b presumed, that the reason why the testator did not revoke the will, was, |hat he was prevented by death; but, if the child dies first, the presumption is, that, not having revoked the will, he intended it to stand. At all events, the testator intended the legacies, on account of which alone this dispute b materal, should be carried into effect, and that the executors whom he appointed should have the management of hb property: and if the court, on a presumed intent, decides against the will, the actual intention of the testator will be defeated."

Dr. Batten and Dr. Swabey contra. “ Though it may be admitted that the will was originally good, it b a general rule that a will b revoked by marriage and the birth of a child.

* In the present case there was a total change in the testator’s situation, from being a widower to becoming again a husband and a father; such a total change as to raise the presumption that he did not intend the will to stand. It has been decided by Sir George Hay, that the cases of a widower and a bachelor are the same. There b no decision that the quantum of the property will vary the presumption. It appears that the case of Brown and Thompson came on first before Sir John Trevor, Master of the Rolls, who held, that the will was revoked; and afterwards before Lord Keeper Wright, who wss of a different opinion on account of the particular circumstances of the case; and Bullet, J. in Doe ex dem. Lancashire

nion of the Master of the Rolb better then that of the Lord Keeper.

“ There are some dicta of Lord Mansfield, but they are only dicta, in Brady and Cubitt, that the will is not revoked by marriage and the birth of a child, if it only coven part of the property. In Doe v. Lancashire, the revocation b held to arise from a tacit condition at the time of making the will. There may be some esses in which a will b allowed to stand, from circumstances repelling the presumption; but nothing is more dangerous than to let a particular equity, arising from the quantity of the effects, operate against a general rule of law. h would introduce a vague and uncertain method of decision, and it b better to adhere to a known presumption of law. The disposition was complete by the will, both as to the real and personal rotate; and the testator has not shewn, since the alteration in hb circumstances^ any intention to adhere to it. Though the real estate b not within the jurisdiction of thb court, it may afford an argument in favour of the revocation that it was wholly devised away.

“ As to the other point.—It b not to be taken for granted in this case, even according to the principles of the Roman law, that the child died first. The doctrine alluded to goes no further than to shew, that when the father and son perish by the same blow of death, the father b supposed to survive hb infant son. But it does not appear that in thb case they did perish by the same blow of death. The ship being cast sway b all that is admitted; non constat that they died by shipwreck. The general law is, that the will was revoked:to take the case out of that law, its revival by the father's surviving, must be shewn on the other side. Thereare passages in Dr. Zcuch which shew, that in testamentary rases the presumption of father or son surviving b not adoffted.

* By the Roman law, if a will was void for the pretermission of a child who afterwards died, the will was not thereby rendered valid; or, if it was revoked by the birth of a posthumous child, the death of that child did not restore it; and in case of a will becoming void by any subsequent cause, the removal of that cause did not restore it by the civil law, though it was otherwise by the praetorian law, which was in the nature of court of equity, and only prevailed for the sake of the hares Scriptus, or residuary legatee. In thb case, the residuary legatee was dead, and the ground on which the jus Pratorium interposed fails. Any particular legatees only had the advantage of its revival incidentally, as it was allowed to stand on account of the general hares Scriptus.

“ Suppose this case were to be decided by the Roman law, and the will were to be restored by survivorship, it could not be restored in the present instance, for no alteration in the father's intention can be presumed to have taken place after the son's death: and it was only upon such presumption that after an Agnatio sui haredis, the will was by the pretorian law restored. If die father did survive a few minutes, there b no room to suppose that he had time to change hb intsnClass I.]

tion. But the doctrine of revival ia no part of the dril law which has been adopted by the law of England. There ia a case of Barrow and Baxter decided in this court; it ia mentioned in Ambler . 431. From the Register it appears, that the wife brought no fortune and had a settlement; there was a child who died before the testator, -and yet the will was held to be revoked. As a matter of general learning, the Roman law is not adopted in these cases by the law of England, for they essentially differ from each other in many respects.

« Sir William Scott and Dr. Nichol in reply.— The civil law, upon the grounds which have been dready urged, b clearly in favour of the will; and the court will not attend to distinctions between Jut pretorium and jus civile. Jut pnetorium was as much a part of the general system as any other, and in fact it was the predominating and overruling authority.

The case of Barrow and Baxter, b certainly contrary to the civil law; and it does not appear if those points were adduced, which in this cause have been urged in support of the will.

With regard to the distinction which has been made between the Acres Script at and a special legatee, the latter was as much intended to be benefited as the former.

* It being the established law that the death of a qumti potthumut revives the will, the dbtance of the interval between hb death and that of the •testator b not material against the presumption of law. The court b not to examinf by evidence whether there was an actual change of intention or not.

« The law, with respect to revocations by marriage and the birth of a child, is, as laid down in Brady and Cubitt, a mere principle of presumption; and, ia that case, all the circumstances must be taken together, and the state of the property may fee very material. It b extraordinary IT there b any decbkm that a paper disposing of small legacies will be revoked by subsequent marriage, dec. that no such case appears. The courts have not gone the length of Lord Mansfield in Brady and Cubitt, by deciding that a revocation does not take place if any property b left: but there b no case where marriage and the birth of a child have been held to amount to a revocation, if the will was such as might have been made after these relations were contracted, fairly end without injury to the family.

* The disposition in the will in question only extends to a very small part of the property, and might be fairly made by a person having a family, the lapsed residuary bequest being as if it had never existed.

The testator having no wife or children at hb death, the tadt condition (which in Doe and Lancashire b considered as the principle of these cases) may be fairly considered as a condition that the will should not take effect if the testator should afterwards have a wife and children toho survived him.

All the cases in the courts of common law admit, that the doctrine upon this subject b borrowed from the dvil law. The courts hare not adopted dl the minute rules and distinctions, but only some

VOL. I.

225

of the general principles; and there b no printiplo better founded on justice, than that if a will b revoked by the birth of a child, it b revived by his death in the life of the father.

" Judgment of the Court:

Sir William Wynne.—It b contended on thg

Eart of the next of kin, that by marriage and thn irth of a child the will became void by implication of law: on the other side it b contended, that ther particular circumstances of the case rebut that im» plication.

It is dearly the general law, that a will made by a bachelor b revoked by subsequent marriage and the birth of a child. That there b a distinction in the case mentioned by Ambler is, I think, a mistake. The principle of the rule b, that tha change of circumstances found a presumption that there b a change ia intention, which may be as strong in favour of a second wife and family as a first; and it does not seem material whether tha will was made by a widower having children or a bachelor.

Hie more weighty argument b drawn front the operation of the will under the circumstances which have happened. The testator has given legades which are not very considerable, and the residue to hb wife. That gift of the readue becama void by her death. If he had left a second wife and son, they would have had their share with tha ether children. Ip Brady and Cubitt it b said by Lord Manafield, that there b no case of a revocation where there b not a total disposition, intimating that the ground of revocation b an entira deprivation. However that may be, if there b an ample portion remaining after a few legacies tn friends, there b no decision that a will would ba revoked. The prindple on which the cases hava gone does not militate against such a will.

“ Thb case b not exactly similar: the testatot gave the bulk of hb property to hb wife early after, marriage. She lived for several yean, during which all then children were bom. The birth of those children would not revoke the will, and ha might mean to leave them in the power of theic mother. She died; and it b not an improhabla supposition, that he, knowing the effect of tha will, suffered it to remain. There b a strong ground then to contend, that, under those circumstances, the case does not foil within the ruin laid down and established for the revocation of wills.

I was not aware ef the case of Barrow and! Baxter, in which the court seems to think the subsequent death of the child would not make an alteration; but the point seems a good deal like that which has been vtxataqiuntia in these courts, and brought before the courts of common law, whether a will, which is revoked by another, b sec up by the destruction of the second. There was a castf to that effect before Sir Gea Lee, of Hellvar and Hellyar, in which it was held, that the will being once revoked remained so. There was an appeal to the delegates, but it was never determined by them. The case of Glaiier and Glasier, 4 Burr-2512, was directly contrary to that; and it wag held that the first will was good. u In Brady v. Cubitt, it was laid down by BnUer; f’.

t The fallowing account of this Act it taken from Barnet’s History of his own Times:—" The Lord* Somers made a motion ih the House of Lords to correct some of the proceedings in the Common Law and in Chancery, that were bock -dilatory and very changeable. He began the morion with some instances that were more conspicuous and grots, and he managed* the matter so, that both the Lord Keeper and Judges concurred with him, though it pastes generally for a maxim, that Jhdjges ooghrratberto enlarge than contract their jumdictioci. A Bill passed the House that began a reformation of proceedings at law, which, as things now stand, are certainly amongst the greatest grievances of the nation. Whetr it went through that House of Commons, it was risible that the interest of Under-Officers Clerks and Attorneys, whose gams were to be lessened by this Bill, was more considered than the interest ef the sterion itself. Several clauses, how beneficial soeverto the subject, which touche# on thtir profits, were left* out by the Commons; But what fault soever the Lords might have found with these alterations, yet, to avoid all dbputerwith tfits Commons, they agreed to their amendments^ *

A principal motive to the engaging in the present work was the removal of any prejudice against the alteration of the law, in consequence of the inconvenient magnitude which the statutes have already attained. In various parts of the worifr such alterations are suggested'ar appeared to be of a beneficial nature, and, as the title of the present numbermust be repeated in Part III, I propose to avail myself of that opportunity of introducing such observations as may appear to be material^ with respect to any alterations in the proceeding? of Courts of Law.

As the Act, of which the contents are very miscellaneous, contains some important provnaona respecting real estates, it is inserted in this plica in conformity with the general prindpth stated in the introductory note to the Statute of Frauds;

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said first day of Trinity Term all the Statutes of Jeofai& shall be extended to judgments which shall at any time afterwards be entered upon confession, NiMU dicit or Non gum informatus, in any Court of Record; and no such judgment shall be reversed, nor any judgment upon anyr writ of enquiry of damages executed thereon be staid or reversed, for or by reason of any imperfection omission defect matter or tiling whatsoever, which would have been aided and cured by any of the said Statutes of Jeofails (2) in case a verdict of twelve men bad been given in the said action or suit, so as there be an original writ or bill and warrants of attorney duly filed according to the law as is now used.

III. Provided always, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the attorney for the plaintiff or demandant in any action or suit, shall file his warrant of attorney with the proper officer of the Court where the cause is depending the same Term he declares; and the attorney for the defendant or tenant shall file his warrant of attorney as aforesaid, the same term he appears, under the penalties inflicted upon attornies by any former law for default of filing their warrants of attorney.

IV. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said first day of Trinity Term it shall and may be lawful for any defendant or tenant in any action or suit, or for any plaintiff in replevin in any Court of Record, with the leave of the same Court (3) to 2 Will. 21.

(2) Defects which are cured by verdict at common law axe not aided by the .statute. The presumption from the verdict in such case is, that the fact which was omitted, or imperfectly alleged, must have been proved in order to have obtained the verdict.—See the cases founded on this distinction in Williams' Note to Stennel r. Hogg, 1 Saund. 228.—See also Note to Crowther v. Oldfield, 1 Salk. 364, 6th Edit.

(3) The omitting to state that the second and subsequent pleas are pleaded by order of the court, although informal, is no cause of demurrer.—Andr. 108—1 Wils. 219—Coup. 500. If leave has not been regularly obtained, the proper course is either to sign judgment or to ajiply to the court to strike out one of the pleas.—Tidd’s Prac. 4th Edit. GOo— 1 Bos. and Pul. 415—1 Chitt. Plead. 452. The courts will not allow twn assumpsit or non est factum to be pleaded with a plea of tender, which necessarily admits a right of action. The Court of C. B. refused to admit pleas of general issue and the Stock-jobbing Act, as the defence under that Act might have been given in evidence under the general issue.—1 Bos. & PuL 222—or non assumpsit and alien enemy.—Id. & 2 B. & P. 72. This last decision was manifestly founded upon very correct principles—the one plea amounting to an absolute bar, the other only to a temporary disability. A plea to be tried by a jury cannot be

joined with ns vnques accouple, which is to be tried by the Bishop.—Harding v. Handing, Comp. Rep. 148. A defendant cannot plead double at the suit of the crown without leave of the Attorney-General.—Willes, 533—Forrest's Each. 57. It is the prerogative of the crown to give two answers to a plea, replication, or any subsequent proceeding, of which see an instance, Rex v. Parry, 14 East. 549.

The supposed inconsistency of two pleas, as not guilty and a justification, is not unfrequendy the topic of a little common-place eloquence at Nisi Prius; but, translating the legal phraseology into common language, is no more than saying. Prove I did it, and then I'll prove that 1 had a right to doit £ and certainly the defence of non feci, si feci, recta feci, does not owe its origin to the Act for the amendment of the law. The necessity of applying for the leave of the court does put some little restraint upon an abuse of the privilege in the Court of Common Pleas, where an application must be made by‘a motion for a rule to shew cause, but even there the restraint is very limited, and is only exercised in such instances as have been specified—and the real practical effect of the requisition to apply for such relief is only an addition to the expence. If the apparent object of the statute bad been attended to, a very salutary use might have* been made of this restraint, by L0

V. Provided nevertheless, That if any such matter shall upon a demurrer joined be judged insufficient, costs shall be given at the discre-. tion of the Court; (4) or if a verdict shall be found upon any issue in the said cause for the plaintiff or demandant, costs (5) shall be also given in like manner, unless the Judge who tried the said issue shall certify, (6) that the said defendant or tenant or plaintiff in replevin, had a probable cause to plead such matter which upon the said issue shall be found against him.

putting defendants under terms of making proper admaaons, so as to prevent the expence of proring facts which are no part of the matter in dispute. In a former publication, I was induced to make the following observations, which have some relation to this subject—Appendix to Pothier, 226. In the case of Webb v. Fox, 7 T. R. 391, to an action of trover, the defendant pleaded the general imue, and also that the plaintiff was a bankrupt. Upon a demurrer to the latter plea. Lord Kenyon said, he could not commend the mode in which the question was brought before the court, since the whole of the case might be gone into upon the general issue; whereas the defendants, in addition to the plea of not guilty, pleaded a special plea, [which, he said, would have been bad upon special demurrer, as amounting to the general issue, ] and which would be attended with additional expence to the parties.—Now it is clear, that in case the court had decided in favour of the plea, much expence would have beeen saved, because the allegations of the parties in the first instance would have brought the peint before the court in as perfect a state as it could have been brought by the great additional expence of a trial and a special case. 1 remember his lordship expresung his disapprobation of the two pleas, with more severity cif manner than appears by the report. The question which I recollect his having asked, —Why, if the special plea was preferred, was the general ianie added ? might have received the very easy answer, that although the defendant might expect by the special plea to obtain a cheap and early detiaaon of the cause, it would not have been judicious to have therefore abandoned every other ground of defence.' *

Notwithstanding the advantage which in many respects arises from the opportunity of going into the whole case on the general issue, there is a great inconvenience in subjecting parties, whose only difference is *ith respect to the legal effect of certain undisputed facts, to go through the expence of a trial, in order to state those facts judicially to the court—but upon this subject, I shall take an opportunity of submitting some observations in another place.

f4) It is only the quantum of the costs which is m the discretion of the court, and not the question whether any costs shall be allowed.—Dubcrly i'. Page, 2 T. R. 391.

(5) An avowant is a plaintiff within this section.—Dodd v. Joddrell, 2 T. R. 235. A defendant in replevin is subject to carts upon avowries

net supported.—Stone cr. Forsyth, ’ Doug. 799, Note.—See Vallum v. Simpson, 2 B. & P. 368, infra Note 7.

(6) The certificate need not be made in court, and may be granted after the plaintiff's application for costs.—Creraer v. Dent, Barnes, 141. In Duberley v. Page, mentioned No. 4, supra. Butler, J. said, he had never known any instance of e Judge, at Nisi Prius, certifying in favour of the party pleading double, when the femes were found against him.

(7) 1 he effect of this clause is only to give the costs of the particular pleadings, when the general judgment is in favour of the defendant. If all the issues are found for the plaintiff, and the Judge certifies under the statute 43 Elis, the plaintiff is entitled to no more costa than damages. If after judgment for the plaintiff upon demurrer as to one plea, the defendant obtains a verdict upon the other, the plaintiff is entitled to the corts of the demurrer.--—Duberley v. Page, supra Note 5* Where upon not guilty, and, not guilty ttitkm & yen s, the defendant had judgment on demurrer at to the second, and the plaintiff afterwards proceeded to trial and had a verdict on the first, the defendant had costa on the demurrer, and no costs of the trial were allowed on either side.—Cooke v. Sayer, Bur. 753.

In Vivian v. Blake, 11 East, 263, the defendant to an action of trespass on the plaintiff’s fishery, pleaded the general issue, and that the locus in quo was a public harbour, where all the king’s subjects had a right to fish, the replication prescribed for a free fishery, which was negatived by the rejoinder. The verdict being found for the plaintiff on the general issue, and for the defendant upon the special pleading, it was ruled that as the issue on the prescription, which had been entered for the defendants, went to the whole trespass, the finding on the whole record being in favour of the defendant, the plaintiff could not be entitled to the costs of the general issue.

It was formerly held, that the plaintiff or defendant in replevin, in whose favour any parti-culer issues were found, (the general result of the suit being in favour of the other party,) was only entitled to the coats of the pleadings—but it is now settled, that he is entitled to the coats of the trial.—Brooke v. Willet, 2 H. BL 435—1Valium v. Simpson, 2 B. & P. 368* The courts allow the particular costs, to which a party is entitled under this Section, to be deducted out of the general costs awarded to the opposite party. i DigitizIdb7vL.

the act, where there is any thing in the suit beyond the mere foreclosure.^* SemMe, Bastard v. Clarke, 7 Vesey, 419. A defendant, in contempt for not answering, cannot apply under the Statute.—Hewitt v. M‘Cartney, 13 Vesey, 560. ' It was said in Perry v. Barker, 13 Vesey, 205, on the information of Lord Redeadale, that the course in Ireland is to decree a sale instead of a foreclosure, and if the sale produce more than the debt, the surplus goes to the mortgagor; If leas, the mortgagee has his remedy for the difference.

The advantage of that course seems very manifest, as it makes the pledge available for its real value, and preserves the rights of the creditor lor the difference. The claims of a mortgagee, upon a suit of foreclosure, are often very much embarrassed by the variety and complication of the interests involved in the right of redemption, snd with which he has no concern. It would much add to the advantage of this security, without

prejudicing any other interest, to authorise the Courts of equity, upon petition, to direct s sale after a definite period, upon giving such notices as to the Court might seem proper—and for the surplus, after satisfying the mortgagee, to be pud into Court subject to be disposed of upon the application of thoae concerned: the sale under the authority of the Court to be a complete title against all claims subsequent to the mortgage, and the purchaser to be no further concerned in the regularity of the proceedings than by having a confirmation of the sale.

By Statute 11 & 12 Geo. Ilf. c. 10, Ir. a power is given to Courts of Equity in Ireland, in case of the interest upon mortgages being in arrears for a year and a half, to appoint a receiver upon petition and affidavit—and by 7 Geo.

Of unity of possession by the monastery of the parsonage and the land titheable—and this exemption takes place as well when they are in the hands of a tenant as when they are in the hands of the owner. The requisites to such exemption are, that the union must have been, 1st, founded upon legal title; 2d, equal with respect to the quantity of estate; 3d, free from the payment of any tithes in any manner; 4th, immemorial, and such im-VOL. I.

memorial possesion must be proved, and is not to be presumed.—Cluvill v. Oram, GwiU. 1354— but see ingram v. Thackstone, infra. II. In respect of order.—Religious orders were, by Pope Pascal II. exempted generally from tithes of land* dum propriis manibus excoluntur. This exemption was confined by Pope Adrian IV. to the orders of Cistercians Templars and Hospitallers, and was afterwards endeavoured by Innocent the Third to be extended to the Premonstratenses, but the extension has not been allowed in this country. By the Council of Lateran, in 1215, received as law in England, the exemption of religious houses was restrained to the lands of which they were at that time m possession. The Cistercians afterward* obtained bulls for the exemption of lands in the hands of tenants. Such exemptions were prevented for the future by Statute 2 Hemy IV, c. 4—but are valid as to privileges then existing. Lands, in respect of which the monasteries were entitled to exemption, ration* ordinis, are exempted, although at the tim* of the dissohitioil they were in die hands of tenants, and as IW1

Lands exempted by the Statute are not chargeable, although they have paid tithes ever since it passed.—EarlofClericourt v. Lady Denton, GwilL 363. Lands exempt under this Statute are not rendered liable by the general provision of an Enclosure Act, that tithes should be paid from the new Inclosure, notwithstanding any modus or exemption in other parts of the parish.—Pratt v.

(5) A prescription, exempting from the penalties of this Act, must be good in law; and the validity of the custom is proper to be tried in an action on- the Statute.—Phillips v. Davies, 6 East, 176.

(6) It is agreed that the Statute gives an exemption with respect to the land here described for the term of seven years. For the exposition of this danse, see 2 Inst. 656. Stockwell v. Terry, 1 Vesey, H5, and the late case of Warwick v. Collins, 2 M. and . 340. It is settled that land, is not entitled to the privilege as barren, on account of the expence of clearing from wood draining inclosing or recovery from the sea, and that the exemption mast be founded upon the natural inaptitude of the toil for the production of a crop without an extraordinary expence in manuring. The proper test of barrenness is, whether the Land requires extraordinary expense either in manure or labour, to bring it into a proper state of culture. Lord Selsea v. Powell, 6 Taunt. 297. In. Hutchins v. Maughan, eked by Eyre, C. B. in Jones r. Le David, 4 Gwll). 1594. Land which from its exposed situation would not grow corn without the expence of erecting stone .walls to protect it from the severity of the climate, was held to be exempt.

The following extrans from Lord EUenborough’s judgment in Warwick v. Collins, seem to comprise the substance of the law upon the subject:— w There are two causes of unproductiveness in land, one arising from the mere neglect of cultivation; the other, because the land is inks nature unfit for and indisposed to receive and return the

benefits of .cultivation. The latter only 9 protected; all land which has not been already cultivated by the plow is, to use Lord Coke’s words, (2 Inst 656) se far not apt far tillage. Something mutt necessarily be done; some labour bestowed; some expence incurred in all cases to conquer this inaptitude. Then comes the question on the limitation in the Statute, whether “ it has paid no tithes by reason of barrenness, '* (an which the comments made on the Statute and the cases have principally turned) in other words, whether it be tudpte Naturd iterilis,; , * and this all agree must be shewn to entitle it to exemption. It seeas neither reasonable nor analogous to the common course of husbandry, to confine the inaptitude for tillage to such causes only as hinder the mere use and passage of the plow over it, such as the incumbrance of wood, of water, or furze and whin; there is an ulterior inaptkude to these in all cases of new land, arising from the rankness and foulness of the soil; and if L may use the ei{session, from its unsubdued condkoan. If the and only require the manure and enkivation ee> dinarfly necessary to bring k into an apt state of tillage, it is not sudpts Naturd iterilis. Sterility «r vi termini, imports an ungrateful soil: a sett of natural and constitutional infecuadity, resisting the ordinary means properly applied to render k otherwise.

The proper enquiry seems to be. Whether the land was of such a nature as to require extraordinary expence either in maiurie* or labour to bring it into a proper i^te of cultivation. oLV"

It is sufficient if the suggestion is proved true in substance, although not proved strictly aa laid; or where the suggestion was, that the parson had 20 acres of pasture and 20 acres of wood in lieu of tithes, and it was proved as to the 'wstuxe and not is to the wood; Andrew v.

XVI. Provided nevertheless, where heretofore such a custom hath been in many parts of Wales, that of such chattel and other goods as hath been given with the marriage of any person, their tithes have been exacted and levied by the parsons and curates in those parts; which custom being dissonant from any part of this realm, as it seemed when the said country of Wales was through civil dissention unculted, for want of other sufficient

Iirofits that might otherwise grow to the curates and ministers there, to lave been for that time tolerable: so now the country being well manured and husbanded, and the tithe is duly paid there of corn hay wool and cheese, and of other increase of all manner of cattle, as it is commonly in all other parts of this realm, the same custom seems to be grievous and unreasonable, especially where the benefices are else sufficient for the finding of the said ministers and curates: That it be therefore enacted No Tithes of by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the first day of May Marriage Goods next coming no such tithes of marriage goods be exacted or required shall be paid of any person within the said dominion of Wales or marches of the same; in Wales, &c. any thing in this Act contained, or any other Act custom or prescription had or made to the contrary hereof notwithstanding. [Cok.Lit. 159. a.]

It was held Mo. 573, that the six months must be in Term time; but this has been since overruled, and the time runs from the teste of the writ of prohibition; Foy v. Lister, 2 Salk. 554; 2 Ld. Raym. 1171. When the declaration was by rule of Court amended, to make it conformable to the proceedings in the Spiritual Court, it was ruled that the time should be computed from the amendment; Mahon v. Acklam, Barnes 428. If the proof be defective it may be amended within the six months, but not after; Stiddar r. Tilar, Lit. 155.

(7) A consultation for not proving the suggestion is not, like a consultation on the merita, a bar to a second prohibition. See Carth. 463; Cro. Car. 208; Trask v. French, 15 East, 574.

(8) Double costs are only given for not proving the suggestion, not for variance between the suggestion and the libel; Hulton v. Barnes, Yelv. 79:and to obtain such costs a consultation must be awarded; Watkinson r. Pacy, Latch. 140; Hey 81.

(a) Set Notes to Sec. 6. supra.—The following ace relative to this subject was taken by the titer:

“ 6th May, 1793. In the Prerogative Court.

“ Wright against Nether* ood.

> A. makes a will leaving some legacies and appointing his wife residuary legatee; the died leaving several children. He married again, and bad one child by his second wife. Afterwards A. with his wife and all his children perished by shipwreck. The wifl h not revoked.] M This case arose on a question, Whether the

will of George Netherwood deceased, was or was not revoked ?

4< On the 24th June 1783, the deceased married

Elisabeth Lomax, spinster. On the 8th of October following he made his will, whereby he charged his real estate with the piyment of debt* and legacies* if his personal should be deficient. He gave some pecuniary and specific legacies, and bequeathed the residue of his permud estate to hi* wife by her maiden name, Elisabeth Leras, and devised the real estate to her for life, remainder to one Joseph Netherwood; he appointed Wright, dm party *

executor of his effects in England, and another executor for his effects in the West Indies.

' Afterwards Elizabeth died, leaving several children by her husband. The testator married the sister of his former wife, and had issue by her ooesoo.

“ The said George Netherwood embarked for England from Jamaica, with his wife her son and all the children by the former marriage. The ship in which they embarked was never afterwards heard of, and was admitted to be lost.

“ The will was proved by the executor in England in common form, and he was afterwards cited by the next of kin of the deceased to prove it in solemn form, or shew cause why it should not be declared invalid.

“ The facts were admitted on both sides to be ns above stated,

41 By the inventory the property of the deceased appeared to amount to about bOOOO/. The legacies amounted to rather more than 200/.

u Sir William Scott and Dr. Nicholl in support of the wilL—The will in this case was not revoked by the second marriage and the birth of a child; for although it may be admitted as a general principle that these circumstances do revoke a will, on the presumption that upon such a total alteration of circumstances the testator did not continue to have the same intentions; that presumption is liable to be repelled by circumstances. If it appears to be his intention that the will should stand, marriage and the birth of a child will not destroy it.

“ AU presumptive revocations are stricii Jurit, and must be wholly inconsistent with the deceased's intention to dispose of his property according to the wilL

u The general principle of these revocations is, that when a person has contracted such new obligations and relations, it cannot be supposed that he meant to adhere to his former disposition. That principle is recognised by all the cases upon the subject, and they all proceed upon the ground of s fatal alteration in the testator's circumstances; but if there is not a total alteration, the implication is repelled.

No case can be stronger against a revocation than this. When he was married he made a will, by which he bequeathed some small legacies, and disposed of the rest of his property to his wife. Thus might be in confidence that she would take enre of any children he should have by her. The wife diet, and the residue becomes lapsed. He marries again, and his fortune will take the same course in point of substance as if he had made no will. The few legacies will belong to the persons to whom they were given, and the residue would be subject to the statute of distribution.

“ There are cases in which it has been held, that this alteration of cirtumst&uces did not amount to a revocation; where the alteration was not such as to make the court say, the testator could not In duty adhere to his will. Such was the case of Brown and Thompson, 1 Eq. Ca. Ab. 413, where it was held that the alteration of circumstances was not sufficient to amount to a revocation; for xu> injury was done any person, and those whom

the testator was bound to provide for were taken care of (Vide the observations of Buller, J. upon this opinion, in Doe r. Lancashire; ) the great bulk would go to the wife and children; all the new relations sre fully satisfied; snd there is no probability of the testator’s not intending to adhere to his former disposition. In Brady v. Cubitr, Doug. 31—38, it is said by Lord Mansfield, 4 That upon his recollection there was no case in which marriage and the birth of a child have been held to raise an implied revocation, where there has wot been a diposition of the whole estate.1 And although that may not be essential, it is certainly very material. Presumed revocations may exist where the residue is very small, but it is otherwise where a small part only is disposed of, and the bulk remains. In Thompson and Shepherd, mentioned in a note to Amb. 490, it was held that marrwge and having children did not amount to a revocation of a will made by a widower who had children. It was not that complete alteration of circumstances which implies the revocation of a declared intention. A case of Calder and Calder, lately decided in the Prerogative Court, doea wot apply, h depended on ita own circumstances; and there was no power to presume that the testator adhered to his intention. That was the case of a will made by a widower having no children; he had no view to the relations of husband and father. The great bulk of his property was left away, and there were declarations shewing hit idea that his property would go to his wife and children upon a marriage subsequent to the will; and the will itself was such as would involve the family in endless litigation. Every circumstance in that case raised the implication, that the will should be revoked. No such circumstances exist in this case; but, on the contrary, every circumstance repels the implication.

There would be a very considerable provision for the wife and her child; and it must be presumed that lie knew the operation of the will; that it disposed of the small legacies according to his intention; that the residue would be distributable according to law; and that his property would be managed by the respective persons in whom he had reposed a confidence for the purpose.”

The advocates for the plaintiff* hiving here closed their arguments, the Judge intimated a wish that the case might be considered upon another point, viz. Whether the will (provided it was revoked j did not revive, as the son by the second wife did not survive his father ? For which purpose, it stood over till the 13th of May; when the advocates before-mentioned argued an that point.

“ In cases where it cannot be actually ascertained whether the parent or the eon survived, and they perished by the same stroke of death, according to the Roman law, it was presumed that if the son had not obtained the age of puberty, the father survived; but if the son had attained that age, that he survived the father. This presumption arises from the degree of strength supposed to belong to the respective parties. It was liable to certain exceptions iu behalf

(1) The drawing a claim conformable to this clause requires a very considerable porrion of technical accuracy, and 1 have in practice known many valuable rights defeated in consequence of the informality of the claim. The discretion reposed in Commissioners upon this subject ia extremely liable to abuse, as such Commissioner! have, if not generally, at least very frequently, the feeling of agents for the parties by whom they are nominated, and 1 have actually heard a Commissioner avow, that he considered himself

as the agent of a particular description of claimants; and it is obvious, that a person with such feelings may be induced to admit or reject the presentation of further claims, according to the interests which he is disposed to espouse. The most suitable remedy for this inconvenience would be a general enactment, that all objection# to claims should be particularly stated in writing, and that the claimant should be at liberty to amend his chum in tbs particulars objected to.

* Partition is often enforced by suit in equity, and such was for s considerable time the more usual course, but the proceeding by writ of partition is now very frequent, and is attended with the advantage of operating upon the estate itself, whereas a court of equity can only direct conveyances. In Parker v. Gerard, AmbL 236-—Nevis *l Levene, cited ibid, it was held, that the paiti-iian must be at the equal expence of tfte parties, however unequal their shares, and although one party offered to relinquish his share rather than incur the expence—but this opinion has not been followed.-^See Calmady v. Calmady, 2 Vesey, jun. 568.—See also a full discussion of the subject in a very complicated case, Agar v. Fairfax, 17 Vesey, 533. In Barry v.Nash, 1 V. & B. 351, it is laid down that upon a bill for partition there are no costs to the hearing, and that the costs of the partition and conveyances are to be borne in proportion to the interests. It might be a considerable improvement of the law to authorise courts

of equity to effect partitions which should be binding upon the legal estates of infants and absent persons, and (o award the tale of interests not conveniently susceptible of division. The Irish. Statute, 9 W. III. c. 12, contains provision* nearly similar to those of the English Statute* 8 & 9 W. c. 31. with the addition of some useful provisions respecting the meers and fences of the lands allotted in partition. The Irish Statute, 8 Geo. I. c. 5, obliges proprietors and tenants of neighbouring lands to make fences between their several holdings, and the statute 5 Geo. 11. c. 9, Ir. contains provisions for the partition of bogs.—-See 1 Gabbett, 477 to 487.

(1) The Statute does not extend to wills previously made, but a republication of a will, or a confirmatory codicil, made after the statute, renders the dispositions void.—Willet v. Sandford, 1 Vesey, 178—Attorney-General v. Heartwell, Amb). 451.

(2) The statute has received a very extensive construction, with respect to the subjects upon which it operates, as being real estate, and it is held to comprehend money due on mortgages— Attorney-General v. Meyrick, 2 Vesey, 44—even as forming a part of a general residue—Pickering e. Lord Stamford, 2 Vesey, jun. 272—(See also White v. Evans, 4 Vesey, 21; ) a right to lay mooring chains in the Thames—Negus v. Coulter, Amb. 367; a sum secured by mortgage of turnpike tolls—Knapp t>. Williams, 4 Vesey 430; or by the bonds of the commissioners of a turnpike —Howse v. Chapman, 4 Vesey, 542; so money-secured by an assignment of county rates, under a special Act of Parliament — Finch t>. Squire, 10 Vesey, 41.

Although the statute contains no express words prohibiting a bequest of money, to be produced by the sale of laud for charitable purposes, it is settled by construction, that such a bequest is within the spirit and meaning of the law.— Per Sir Wm. Grant; Curtis r. Hutton, 14 Vesey, 537.

(3) The prohibition, as to money to be laid out in lands, extends to a disposition to pay off the mortgate on a chapel—Corbyne. French, 4 Vesey, 418; or to enable trustees to complete a purchase of Land, ibid. arg. In Widmore v. Woodroffe, Amb. 636, 1 Bra. Ch. 13, a devise to the corporation of Queen Anne's bounty, was held void, because the corporation are bound by their roles, confirmed by the King under the great seal, to lay out thpir funds in the purchase of lands. It was urged, that a power was reserved to the crown to make new rules, and the point was suggested, whether, if such a law were to be made, it would «iat extend to the case; but by the Lord Chan-ciuncellor (Lord Camden,) the rules are of force 30^10

till they are altered, and were in force at the death of the testator, when the legacy was to take place —and udoq the authority of this case, a disposition to the Society for increasing Clergymen* Livings in England or Wales was held void, 'as 1.0 other society was deemed to meet the description in the will.—Middleton u. Clitheroe, 3 Vesey, 734. But now, by statute 43 GeoJII. c. 11)7, ante Part I. Class II. No. 29, devises of land to the Governors of Queen Aune’shounty are expressly allowed.

A bequest of 3001. to be laid out in the purchase of lands, or on some real Security, is void.— Attorney-General v. Bowles, 3 Atk. 806.

Where money was given to be laid out in erecting a school. Lord Hardwicke intimated, that if any other person would give a piece of land, the money might be so applied, . C but the contrary doctrine is now completely settled—and in the Attorney-General v. Nash, 3 Bro. Ch. 588, it was held, that a bequest to build a house for a schoolmaster was void, although the trustees purchased lands with their own money, which they offered to give to the charity. So a bequest to erect and build a hospital is void.—Attorney-General v. Heart well, Amb, 451. So Vaughan v. Farrer, 2 Vesey, 182. A bequest for the purpose of erecting a free-school void, although there was s piece of vacant land in mortmain within the parish, on which part of a school-house stood, the will not pointing at those premises.—Attorney-General v. Hyde— Vide case of Royston free-school, AmbL 751, 1 Bro. Ch. 444. Note.

A bequest to build a new parsonage house is good —Ghibb v. Attorney-General, A mb. 373.—and it is evident, from all the cases, that a disposition for building upon or improving land already in mortmain is valid.—See the several cases cited in the Attorney-General v. Parsons, 8 Vesey, 186.

Where there there is a discretion to invest money in land or in a manner not prohibited—as in^ personality (or in land in Scotland, which is ex-’ cepted in sec. 6,) it seems to be agreed, that the disposition is good, and in that case the trustees may exercise their discretion, by investing the money in land.—Vi. Vaughan v. Farrar, 2 Vesev, 182—Grimmett v. Grimmett, Amb. 210— Soresby v. Hollins, and Grayson r. Atkinson, cited ibid—Curtis v. Hulton, 14 Vesey, 537. The case of Grimmett i'. Grimmett is s strong case of construction in support of such discretion. But where the interest of 120h was to be paid to the poor, and the money was to be laid out in land as soon as the trustees could meet with a purchase, it was held, that the direction to invest in land was imperative, and the disposition therefore void.—Englishe r. Orde, Highmore on Mortmain, 82—See also Grieves v. Case, 4 Bro- 67. A disposition to purchase land for a charity 11 and in case the charity could not by law take place according to her directions, to lay out the mon$y in such' charitable uses as near to her intentions as could be, and the laws would be”—led to

be fraudulent and void.—Attorney-General v. Tyndall, Amb. 614.

Where a disposition of land for charitable purposes is void by the statute, a personal funa attached to it is void also—as gft of houses, as alms-houses for certain poor objects, and an annual sum to each house.—-Attorney-General v. Goulding, 2 Bro. Ch. 428, confirmed under circumstances similar in effect, Attorney-General v. Whitchurch, 8 Vesey, 141. So a bequest of a residue to purchase or build a chapel, where the executors might think it most wanted, and any overplus to go to the support of a minister, not exceeding 201. a year, and any further overplus to such charitable purposes as the executors might think proper—the purchasing or buildings chapel, (which according to the cases above cited could not be supported,) being the primary object, the whole was void. See also, to the same effect, Attorney-General v. Davies, 9 Vesey, 535. As to the case of the object of building a chapel being left vague in respect of the requisite amount.— Chapman v. Brown, 6 Vesey, 404.

But a disposition may be partly good and partly void when the purposes are distinguishable—ax where a person having founded alms-houses by a valid deed, bequeathed a sum of money in trust, to apply the surplus interettin rebuilding repairing altering adding to or improving the messuages or tenements ground and appurtenances before conveyed, the disposition was declared valid, so far as the money was to be applied in rebuilding repairing altering or improving the premises, and so far as the additions should be made upon the land before conveyed—but bad so far as any addition should be made, by acquiring other land. Attorney-General v. Parsons, 8 Vesey, 186, Note. The discretionary power of the trustees seems not to have been adverted to Where a testatrix gave a house upon trust, to deposit ink the books thereafter given and purchased—and gave to trustees all the religious books which she might leave at her death, and her personal estate upon trust, to apply the residue of her estate for the use of the Welch circulating schools—and for the increase and improvement of Christian knowledge, and promoting religion as the trustees should think proper—and to purchase new Bibles, Ac.c. for such pious uses as were intended concerning those already bought—and, in the mean time, to deposit the said Bibles, &c. in the said house. The disposition as to the personal estate was sustained, the Lord Chancellor being of opinion that the charity ' wis not so engrafted into, connected with, and placed upon an establishment in real property, that the charity coald not subsist, as the realestate was so given-that the house was meant to be subservient to the distribution of books, but not necessarily connected with that purpose.—Attorney-General v. Stepney, 10 Vesey, 22, Vide 2 Mars. 61. 6 Taunt. 359.

trust, or for the benefit of any charitable uses whatsoever; (4j) unless such gift conveyance appointment or settlement of any such kiwis tenements or hereditaments sum or turns of money or personal estate (other than stocks in the publick funds) be and be made by deed indented sealed and delivered in the presence of two or more credible witnesses, twelve calendar months at-least ltefnre the death of such donor or grantor (including the days of the execution and death,) and be inrolled in his Majesty’s High Court of Ci»ani*ery within six calendar months next after \ne exethe payment of an annuity, devised the name to G. . his heirs and assigns for ever; but her wish and desire was, that G. ., in his life-time, should convey the estate to soma charitable uses, the choice of which was left entirely to his discretion: and subject to this, G. . was to enjoy the estate to his own use for his life. Held, that this was a devise void by 9 Geo. 2. c. 36, by whit h act the estate given and not merely the trust, was made void; and that the legal estate, upon the death of the devisee for life, descended on the heir at law. Doe, d. Burdett v. Wrighte, 2 B & A. 710.

(4) In Durour v. Motteux, 1 Vesey, 320, a testator devised 1200/. or thereabouts, to be laid out in the purchase of land for certain charitable uses confessedly void—the remainder of the lands to pay an annuity of 10/. to a minister, to preach a sermon to his memory, and keep his tomb-stone in repair, and certain annual sums to the clerk and sexton, and the corporation of St. Albans, for keeping the accounts. The whole was adjudged to be void. The annuity to the minister was a charitable use which was not prevented by the addition of the sermon—so were the annuities—and the rest was not only s vain concomittant of the charitable bequest, but s circumstance attending the general execution thereof; and if that construction were not made, it might elude the Act of Parliament, for the reward for doing those offices might be as great as the testator pleased; so the gift to the corporation was a reward for their service, and but a circumstance attending the charitable bequest; and though the keeping the accounts was not void, yet if the charity on which it was to attend was void, it must be so too. A disposition, to bring water from A. to B. for the use of the inhabitants of a town, ia a charity and void. Jones v. Williams, Ambler, 651. So of money from land to be appropriated to the improvement of a town—House v. Chapman, 4 Vesey, 542; for the purpose of establishing a botanical garden ', the testator declaring that he thought it would be a public benefit. Townley v. BedweH, 6 Vesey, 194.

In Doe dem Philips v. Aldridge, 4 T. R. 264, land was devised to Aldridge upon trust, that he should convey the same to take place after his decease for the support of preaching the wonl of God at the meeting-house at L and expressing that the testator expected he would settle and forward every thing to promote and carry on the

work of God at L both in his lifetime and

after his decease, and it was held, that though the subsequent limitation was void the defendant’s life estate was clearly good.

[There can be little doubt, that if no objection had existed to the legality of the devise, the expression of the expectation would have been deemed imperative; for which see several

cases cited in a note to the report; and in the case next mentioned. Lord Commissioner Ashurst observed, that perhaps it was not so much looked into as it might Hhve been. It sppeara also to have been decided in the absence of Ashurst and Buller J. and with that kind of hurry which is always to be regretted in the administration of justice.]

* But in Grieves v. Case, 4 Bro. Ch. 67, 1 Vesey, jun. 548, upon a devise of money to be laid out in lands for Mendham for life; afterwards as to part for Eastaugh for Hfe; and as to the remainder to the preacher of a certain chapel for the time being, he and E. exchanging the duty; and after the decease of both, to the preacher or preachers tt the chapel, with r proviso that if Mendham or Easthaugh should withdraw preaching at the chapel, to go to the preachers appointed in their room, the whole was determined *to be void. And per Lord Commissioner Eyre, “ It was argued that there was a personal bounty intended for M. and E. 1 agree that there was; but k is equally apparent, that it flowed from a confidence in them, in the character of ministers, and not in any other way. Then it comes to the question, whether if a plain trust and disposition to a charitable use is manifested by the will, and intended throughout, but if that disposition is also manifested with a certain degree of personal bounty and favour to particular objects that will take the case out of the statute: but I am of opinion, that if the personal bounty cannot be separated from the general object in respect of which they are to have that preference, it is not sufficient.”

Upon a devise to trustees to take a house as a school, and that the children and grand children of certain relations of the testator should be educated there, and then placed'out as apprentices; and that such other boys and girls should be placed there as the trustees should think fit: the disposition was held good so far as regarded the particular relations coming in esse within the time allowed by law; and void so far as it went to establish a charity for general purposes; —the Lord Chancellor declared he did not mean to prevent the trustees from taking other children as long as the sch<x>l was to be kept open for the ehildren and grand children, Blandford v. Thack-erell, 2 Vesey, jun. 238.4 Bra Ch. 394; but See White v. White, 7 Vesey, 423. Attorney General v. Price, 17 Vesey, 371. Isaac v. De Pries, note, ibid, in which dispositions to poor relations were sustained as general charities.

In Curtis v. Hulton, 14 Vesey, 537, it was contended, that a disposition of land for charitable purposes in Scotland or elsewhere out of England was good, but ruled contra.

II. Provided always, That nothing herein before mentioned relating The said li-to the sealing and delivering of any deed or deeds twelve calendar months mitations not at least before the death of the grantor, or to the transfer of any stock six to extend to calendar months before the death of the grantor or person making such purchases or transfer, shall extend or be construed to extend to any purchase of any transfers made estate or interest in lands tenements or hereditaments, or any transfer of for valuable any stock to be made really and bona fide for a full and valuable considera- considerations, tion actually paid at or before the making such conveyance or transfer

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all gifts Gifts, &c. made grants conveyances appointments assurances transfers and settlements otherwise, ab whatsoever, of any lands tenements or other hereditaments, or of any solutely void, estate or interest therein, or of any charge or incumbrance affecting or

to affect any lands tenements or hereditaments, or of any stock money goods chattels or other personal estate, or securities for money to be laid out or disposed of in the purchase of any lands tenements or hereditaments or of any estate or interest therein, or of any charge or incumbrance affecting or to affect the same, to or in trust for any charitable uses whatsoever, which shall at any time from and after the said twenty-fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty-six, be made in any other manner or form than by this Act is directed and appointed shall be absolutely and to all intents and purposes null and void, (tt)

(5) A conveyance of land* subject to a perpetual rent charge to the grantor for charitable purposes, is apparently void, although the rent charge is intended as a full equivalent, without any purpose of bounty on the part of the grantor. On this account it was thought necessary, under the sanction of several opinions of the first eminence, to obtain an Act of Parliament to confirm the title of the Manchester Infirmary. The practice is to make a grant or demise in general terms; and for the grantees to make a subsequent conveyance or declaration of trust.

(6) A grant by deed, executed and' enrolled, pursuant to this statute, of lands to trustees and their heirs, to the use of one of them, his heirs and assigns, upon condition that he, his heirs and assigns, should, from time to time, repair a vault and tomb standing upon part of the lands, and, if need be, rebuild it, and permit the same to be used as a family vault for the grantor and any of her family, and, in default thereof, then over to the other trustee his heirs and assigns, is not within this clause. Doe, d. Thomson v. Pitcher, 3 M. and . 407. vide 2 Mars. 61.

(7) A contract for sale of land to a charity upon which the purchase-money was not paid in the life of the seller, not carried into effect after his death against his heir at the instance of the charity and personal representatives.—Attorney General v. Day, 1 Ves. 218.

The owner of land having, at his own expence, built a chapel, which was used for the purpose of public worship, and the congregation having subscribed a sum of money far die purpose of enlarging and improving the same, he, in consideration that the money so subscribed should be expended for that purpose, demised the premises by lease for twenty-three years, reserving a peppercorn rent dyring his life, and 10/. per annum after his death. A declaration of trust was afterwards executed by some of the lessees, declaring that they would hold the premises in trust for the congregation assembling at the chapel, and that in case the public worship should be there discontinued, then that they would assign the premises for civil purposes. Held a conveyance for the benefit of a charitable use, and void under this statute. Also, that neither the sum agreecbto be expended on the premises, nor the rent reserved at the death of the lessor, could be considered a full consideration paid for the lease, so as to bring the case within the 2d section. And also, that' the declaration of trust, although executed only by some out of the several lessees, was evidence against ail of the purpose for which the lease was granted. Doe d. Welland, v. Hawthorn, 2 B« and A. 96.

(8) A devisee in general terms may be compelled to answer whether the devise was made upon a secret trust or promise to apply the property to charitable uses; in which case the statute attaches. See Strickland v. Aldridge, 9 Vesey* 516, and the authorities there cited; but if there is a will in itself valid, and a subsequent unattested paper not communicated to the devisee, indicating the purpose of the testator to devote the land to charitable purposes, the devisee mav object that the estate was devised by a will well

It is settled that a court of equity will not marshal assets so as to give a charitable legacy a preference in the application of the personal estates, and throw a greater burthen on the real estate in respect of debts and other legacies.— Makeham v. Hooper, 4 Bro. Cb. 153, and the several cases there cited. As to the manner of apportioning the respective funds, see the Attorney General v. the Earl of Winchelsea, 3 Bio. Ch. 373. Howse v. Chapman, 4 Veaey, 642. Paice v. Archbishop of Cam. 14 Vet. 361.

In Arnold v. Chapman, 1 Vesey, 10P, upon a devise to J. . he paying the testator's executors 1000L and the residue of the personal e>tate to a charity, it was ruled that the legacy was intended as part of the charitable fund, and being void, enured for the benefit of the heir at Law. Grosvenor v. Hallam, cited one Bro. Ch. 61. Devise subject to a rent upon trust to sell and pay the money as directed, the rent being for charitable purposes, belongs to the heir at law, and not to the legatee of the money. See this case, Ambl. 643.

In Jackaon o. Hu clock, Ambler 487, upon a devise to . M. subject to charitable legacies, ruled that the legacies sunk for the benefit of the "devisee. So Wright v. Row, 1 Bro. Ch. 61. A void charitable legacy of personalty or res] estate, converted out and out into personalty, falls into the general residue. Durour v. Motieux, 1 Ves. 321. So in case of a bequest of leasehold premises. Stanley v. Barker, 4 Vesey, 732, but upon a trust to sell and pay the purchase money, or a particular part thereof, to a charity, the heir

is entitled to the amount given to the charity. See Ackroyd v. Smithson, 1 Bra Ch. 503. Gibbs v. Ramsey, 2 V. and B. 294. As to funds provided for charity legacies being applied to make good a deficiency of assets for other legacies. See Currie v. Pie, 17 Vesey, 462.

(yj In the case of Christ's College, Cambridge, 1 Bl. 90* it was ruled that a devise to certain officers of the college to maintain certain students there, and for other charitable purposes, was good, as relating to the students of the college; but void so far as the college were appointed trustees for other charitable purposes. By Srat. 5l Geo. III. c. 105, dispositions in favour of the Royal Naval Asylum are excepted out of this Act. There is also an exception by stat. 12 Geo. II. c. 31. in favour of Bath Hospital; and probably there may be other instances of a similar nature.

In Middleton v. Cater, 4 Bro. Ch. 409, it seems to be taken for granted, that a custom for the freemen of London to devise in mortmain would be good, notwithstanding the statute; but it was decided that the custom extends only to land in London.

(10) Ruled that a devise of land to University College to buy livings was good, although they had already the limited number, as the devise might be performed by the exchange of advowsons.

lyWHEREAS by an Act passed in the ninth year of the reign of His late f f Majesty King George the Second, and intituled An Act to restrain the g 6.2. c. 36. disposition of lands whereby the same become unalienable, it was amongst other things enacted, that after the twenty-fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty-six, no manors, lands, tenements, rents, advowsons, or other hereditaments, corporeal or incorporeal, whatsoever, should be given, granted, aliened, limited, released, transferred, assigned, or appointed, or anyways conveyed or settled to or upon any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, or otherwise, for any estate or interest whatsoever, or anyways charged or incumbered by any person or persons whatsoever, in trust or for the benefit of any charitable uses whatsoever, unless such gift, conveyance, appointment, or settlement of any such lands tenements or hereditaments, were made by deed indented sealed and delivered in the presence of two or more credible witnesses, twelve calendar months at the least before the death of such Donor or Grantor,

(including the days of the execution and death,) and where enrolled in His Majesty’s High Court of Chancery within six calendar months next after the execution thereof, and unless the same were made to take effect in possession, for the charitable use intended, immediately from the making thereof, and were without any power of revocation, reservation, trust, condition, limitation, clause, or agreement whatsoever, for the benefit of the Donor or Grantor, or of any person or persons claiming under him; but it was thereby provided, that nothing therein-before mentioned, relating to the sealing and delivery of any deed or deeds twelve calendar months at least before the death of the Grantor, should extend or be construed to extend to any purchase of any estate or interest in lands tenements or hereditaments, to be made really and bona fide for a full and valuable consideration actually paid at or before the making such conveyance, without fraud or collusion; and it was thereby enacted, that all gifts, grants, appointments, assurances, transfers, and settlements whatsoever, or any lands tenements or other hereditaments, or of any estate or interest therein, or of any charge or incumbrance affecting or to affect any lands tenements or hereditaments, to or in trust for any charitable uses whatsoever, which should at any time after the said twenty-fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty-six, be made in any other manner or form than by the said Act was directed A and appointed, should be absolutely and to all intents and purposes null and void: And whereas the said provision contained in the said recited Act, in relation to the purchase of any estate or interest in lands tenements or hereditaments, for a full and valuable consideration, was only intended to prevent such purchases from being avoided by reason of the death of the Grantor within twelve calendar months after the sealing and delivery of the deed or deeds relating thereto: And whereas it has notwithstanding been generally apprehended that the said last-mentioned provision was intended wholly to exempt such purchases from the operation of the said Act, and in consequence thereof the formalities by the said Act prescribed, in relation to the conveyance of hereditaments to charitable uses, have in divers instances been omitted on purchases for a full and valuable consideration, and by reason of such omission the title to such hereditaments may be considered defective :a And whereas it is expedient that provision should be made for remedying such defect in manner herein-after mentioned: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That where any lands tenements and hereto Purchase of Lands for Charitable Purposes to be valid, although the Formalities prescribed by recited Act have not been duly performed.

Note to the Statutes on Fraudulent Conveyances.

Introduction, § 1- The Statutes 13 and 27 Eliz. have been fully commented upon by Mr. Roberts in an express treatise respecting them, of which the editor baa fully availed himself in the view which it taken of the subject in the present note, although veiy materially differing from that gentleman in many of his ideas upon the subject.

The Statutes in question so far as they relate to actual intentional fraud, may, perhaps, be considered as little more than declaratory of the common lew, but their operation extends to several cates in which dispositions, unobjectionable in themselves, are rendered invalid in consequence of the prejudice which third persons might receive by allowing their validity:and the term fraudulent, as used in the statutes, and in the cases which have been decided upon their construction, is in general inflnded to denote no more than an invalidity in certain dispositions, arising from the insufficiency of their consideration, or from other incidental circumstances, in consequence of which they are not allowed to operate in prejudice of other interests, which the statutes were particularly intended to protect, and not to express the immorality of intention, which is understood in the more general and popular signification of th« expression. The kind of fraud, which is the object of the statutes, may therefore, in respect to the original disposition, be commonly expressed by the term voluntary, which, although not used in the statutes, is of general occurrence in the cases that 9 have been decided respecting their operation.

The statute 13 Eliz. is chiefly for the protection of creditors, whose claims do not

Class VII.]

Fraudulent Conveyances.

immediately regard the particular property which is the subject of the disposition impeached as invalid, but who hare a general right to obtain satisfaction by meant of such property, in respect of the personal obligations of the party making the disposition.

The statute 27 Elis, is for the protection of purchasers whose rights hare a direct and immediate relation to the specific subject disposed of or affected by the previous disposition impeached as deficient in legal validity—and* the relief afforded by this sutute is, in some cases, more extensive than that which results from the preceding one.

965

2. In the following view of the subject, 1 shall first endeavour to trace the Division of the

operation of the statutes as they affect real estates, or real and personal estates Subject, equally, reserving the consideration of the law peculiarly affecting the disposition of personal property for a distinct and subsequent examination. In this distribution, real estates are adverted to generally, as comprising all rights in land, although constituting personal property only, in respect to the degree of interest—the substantial distinction between the respective kinds of property, as connected with the present discussion, being, that all interests in real estates, although only amounting to chattels in regard to property, are regulated by actual title, whereas the operation of the law, upon mere personal or moveable property, is more particularly determined by the apparent and oetensible possession.

The invalidity of the dispositions affected by the statutes relates, either I. To the interests intended to be protected, comprising, 1st, Creditors and others who are entitled to the benefit of the sutute 13 EUz.—2d, Purchasers who are protected by 37 Eli*.; or, II. To the nature and character of dispositions which are impeached as fradulent, on account of their being deficient in the qualities that are requisite for their support in opposition to the respective interests which are the object of protectieur —and which will be designated by the term of voluntary settlements, reserving (otherwise than incidenully) to a future period the consideration of the circumstance# to which that term may be properly applied.

$ 3.1. It is perfectly evident that a voluntary settlement is void so far as it affects Of Settlements the rights of creditors existing as such at the time of making it.—With respect to sub- void or other-sequent creditors, the validity of the settlement depends upon the fact of the party wjtey u against being indebted at the time. In Lord Townsend v. Wvndham, 2 Vesey, 1. 10. Creditors.

Lord Hardwicke said, M there is no esse where a person indebted makes a conveyance for the benefit ef a child without valuable consideration, and dying indebted afterwards, that that shall take place; but it shall be considered as a part of his estate for the benefit of his creditors *, ' * and in Stephen v. Clive, 2 Bro. Ch. 90. Lord Kenyon, as Master of the Rolls, relying principally upon the above observations ef Lord Hardwicke, held, 1. That a settlement after marriage in favour of a wife and children by a person not indebted at the time *, was good against subsequent creditors, and not within the 13 Eli*.; and, 2. That although the settler was indebted, yet if tho debt were secured by a mortgage, the settlement was good. In Lush v. Wilkinson, b Ves. 384, a subsequent creditor charged insolvency, which was denied; the defendant (the wife) went into evidence to shew that her husband had been in good circumstances. No evidence was produced by the plaintiff; —and an account and enquiry being asked on his behalf, the Master of the Rolls (Lord Alvanley) said,

* You appear as a subsequent creditor, and desire an acceunt in order to invalidate this settlement, by proving prior debts. 1 have a great doubt whether you have a right to come witnout proving any one antecedent debt. A single debt will not do.

Every man must be indebted for the common bills of his house, .though he pays them every week. It must depend upon this, whether he was in insolvent circumstance# at the time.’*—The bill waa dismissed with costs, with liberty to file another bill.—See also to the same effect, Russell v. Hammond, 1 Atk. 13. Walker v. Burrows, 1 Atk. 93.

(decided upon the more extensive construction of st. 21 Ja. 1. with respect to bankruptcy) Middlecome v. Marlow, 2 Atk. 520.

In riie before-mentioned case of Lord Townsend r. Wyndham, Lord Hardwicke (after adverting to the difference between statute 27 Elis, as to subsequent purchasers, and 13 Elis, as to subsequent creditors) said, «If there is a voluntary conveyance by one not indebted at the time, though he afterwards becomes indebted, if that voluntary conveyance was for a child, and no particular evidence or badge of fraud to deceive or defraud subsequent creditors, that will be good; but if any mark of fraud collusion or intent to deceive subsequent creditors appears, that will make it void, otherwise not, but it will stand, though afterwards he becomes indebted/ *

In Stileman v. Ashdown, 2 Atk. 477, Lord Hardwicke decreed satisfaction to creditors from estates purchased by the father in the joint names of himself and hi#

' ^Fraudulent Comoeyatuxs [Part 11.

aon; ^he father having had poammion of the whole estate, and appeared as viable owner. Hi* Lordship said, tf It is not necessary that a man should actually be indebted at the time he enters into e voluntary settlement to make it fraudulent; for if a man does it with a view to being indebted at a future time, that is equally fraudulent, and ought to be eat aside. See Frtxer tu Fitter, 2 Aik. 511, in which a settlement made upon a separation between husband end wife wee poetpencd to the daim of a creditor having an alignment under an Insolvent Act, without any reference to the time when the debt was contracted, or the situation of the husband at that time.

In Montague v. Lord Sandwich, cited in Kidney v. Couasraaker, 12 Vesey, 155, it was held by Lord Loughborough, that a settlement is fraudulent only against such creditors as were creditors at the time: and Sir William Grant referring to that case, says, that though there has been much controversy, and a variety of deriaioae upon the question, whether such a settlement is fraudulent as to any creditors accept such as were creditors at the time, —he was disposed to follow the latest derim us that of Montague and Lord Sandwich. Mr. Vesey mates in a note, that though the settlement can be affected as fraudulent only as against creditors at the time it is made, the consequence, if it can be so affected, is, that the subject is thrown into assets, and all subsequent creditors are let in; and states that it was so clearly held m Montague and Lord Sandwich.

In Hungerford v. Earle, 2 Vera. 216, the question as to the validity of a settlement against subsequent creditors, was ordered by the Court of Chancery to be tried at law. Sed vide White tu Hussey and others, Prec. in Cba. 14, where all the Lands Caramisnoneis were of opinion they might decree a conveyance to be fraudulent without a trial at law.

In Russell v. Hammond, (before cited on another point) 1 Atk. 13, the father, upon settlement in favour of his son, took back an annuity to himself and his wife, which Lord Haidwicke said was a plain badge of fraud, as the annuity was probably the full value of the estate comprised in the deed, and therefore gave the son nothing, which was almost tantamount to a continuance in possession, and had always been deemed a strong circumstance of fraud.

[The editor of Atkyns observes, that the settlement last mentioned does not appear in the register’s bosk, where the case is stated but very shortly: and it is very difficult to conceive it possible, that Lord Haidwicke should have made such a detenu-nation; for the circumstance of the father receiving back an annuity was so far from giving strength to the position of the transaction being fraudulent, as voluntary, chat it converts it into a matter of mere contract, and to say, that because the father gave the son nothing, that is, because the son gave a full eqivalent, the tan should bw deprived of the right of which in respect of thst equivalent he became a purchaser, seems to be as plain a perversion of justice as any that can be well imagined. The greater the annuity, in proportion to the value of the estate, the less fraudulent is the aspect of the transaction; —and even in cases of ordinary bargain between strangers, it is not uncommon to sell an estate iu consideration of a life annuity, which in the nature of things ^ill be of greater amount than the annual value of the estate.)— See Taylor v. Jones, 2 Atk. 600, in which the Master of the Rolls held s settlement of stock limiting a life estate to the husband void against creditors, without examining how far the party was indebted at the time. He said he had always a greet compassion for wife and children; yet on the other side it was passible, that if creditors should not have their debts, their wives and children might be reduced to want. The observation is certainly true; but as voluntary settlements are often supported against creditors, some ocher reasons were requisite to render it very material. As to the power assumed in this case, over stock, ri. Dumbs v. Dulene, i Ves. jim. 196.—Rider t>. Kidder, 16 Ves. 360.

A person on whose behalf a covenant is entered into, which is contingent at the time of making the disposition impeached, as a wife claiming under covenant to make a provision in case of her surviving, seems to be a sufficient creditor within the statute 13 Elis.—Rider v. Kidder, 10 Ves. 360.

A creditor, to impeach a settlement in equity for fraud, must get judgment for his debt.—Colman v, Croker, 1 Ves. jun. 160. But this rule apparently does not apply to a bill for the administration of the assets of a party deceased.

The general effect of marriage settlements will be more particularly examined in the subsequent part of this note, as applicable to purchasers.—In Campion v. town, \7 Ves. 268, it is decided at the Rolls, that the validity of a settlement previous to marriage is not affected by die husband being indebted at the time, ' and the wife knowing it. In that case it was stated by the counsel for the defendant, that no decision was to be found in which a settlement previous to and in contemplation of msrriage, bad been considered aa void against creditors; but R was ldinittedJ that a

Class VII.} Fraudulent Couoeya*oet. 307

case shewing enough for that purpose, might exist, u if the wife was dearly a party, and the marriage a more secure mode of defrauding the creditors. By the same case it appears, that money expended in improving the wife’s estate, redeeming land tax, »nfranrhi«ing copy hold, &c« cannot be followed by creditors.

It is a settled rule, that if a person having a general power of appointment makes a voluntary appointment in pursuance of such power, it will except as against a bona fide purchaser from the appointee enure, in favour of creditors, although the non-execution of the power cannot be supplied/ &c.—Holmes 1/. Coghill, 7 Ves. 499,

12 Ves. 206.—George v. Milbanke, 9 V esey, 190, and the several cases cited upon this subject, Powell on Powers, 264.—The doctrine certainly is a very extraordinary one, as the principle of the statutes against fraudulent conveyances was to prevent the doing such acts as would militate against the interests which third persons would have had in the subject of the acts if they had not been done.

A conveyance not fraudulent within the statute 13 Elis, may be void In case of bankruptcy by the operation of stat. 21 Jac. 1. c. 15, as to which see Walker v. Burrows,

1 Atk. 93, above referred to.

§ 4. II. The construction of the statute 27 Elis, has always been very extensive Of Settlements an favour of purchasers, and it is settled by a series of authorities, that a voluntary vojd or other-conveyance is void against a subsequent purchaser, even with notice—and although wfce again$ there arc some cases which seem to favour the opposite opinion, the doctrine may be purchasers, considered as conclusively established by the case of Doe on the demise of Otley v.

Manning, 9 East. 59, in which, upon a very full and elaborate view of the subject, the Court declared, that they felt themselves bound by the weight of authorities to give judgment according to the settlement. The following observations are in the Voluntary Set-concluding part of Lord Ellenborough’s judgment, Much property has no doubt dements void been purchased, and many conveyances settled, upon the ground of its having been M again«r Pur-80 repeatedly held, that a voluntary conveyance is fraudulent, as such, within the chasers, even statute of 27 Elis.—And it is no new thing for the Court to hold itself concluded wjtj1 notfce# in matters respecting rial property, by former decisions, upon questions in respect of which, if it were res Integra, they probably would have come to very different conclusions. And if the adhering to such determinations is likely to be attended with inconvenience, it is a matter fit to be remedied by the legislature, which is able to prevent the mischief in future, and to obviate all the inconvenient consequences which are likely to result from it, as to purchases already made. And we cannot but say, as at present advised, and considering the construction put on the statute, that it would have been better if the statute had avoided conveyances only against purchasers for valuable consideration, without notice of the prior conveyance.”

The importance and justice ef the preceding observations, as to the necessity of adhering to previous authorities in matters respecting real property, on account of the injurious and retrospective consequences which would arise from disturbing them are very manifest—but 1 have often taken the opportunity of expressing my wish, that the implicit acquiescence in authority had been confined to such cases as these, and to matters of mere technical reasoning, in which a decision of the question one way or the other is indifferent in its general consequence*; and that the Courts would feel themselves more at liberty than they do in departing from mere authority upon questions of evidence, of pracuce, of personal contract and obligation; or cases where the adherence to such authority is confessedly repugnant to the real purpose of justice, and no material inconvenience could arise from the judicial correction of it; admitting, at all times, the caution with which this principle ought to be adopted—the presumption in favour of the subsisting doctrine—the inconveniences which even in these cases may result from the alteration—and the qualification that a manifest and evident utility alone ought to be deemed sufficient to authorise the deviation.

With respect to the particular subject, there is a difference of opinion as to whether the rule at present established by authority is not that which, independently of authority, is most conformable to justice and the true intention of the statute, and a very great portion of Mr. Roberts’ treatise is employed in maintaining that it is so. I cannot, however, but entertain a very strong and decided preference in favour of the opposite opinion. The object of the statutes is evidently to prevent fraud and imposition—it is equally clear, that in the case in question, no fraud, no imposition would be practised by supportidg the preceding conveyance, which is confessedly valid against the party making it, and those claiming under him by gratuitous title; and which conveyance, although not founded upon those considerations which are regarded as valuable in point of legal construction, may be occasioned by very meritorious inducements. It is said, that the subsequent conveyance attaches a fraudulent intention to the first and therefore is sufficient to invalidate it; whereas

* ^.

k w31 be quite imposrible to bring the case to any more than, that a person who bat made an actuul donation repents of his haring done so and wishes to resume it, bat jmc bring enabled to effectuate his purpose directly, is impowered to effectuate it circuitously, by procuring the co-operation of a third person, who, with perfect knowledge of the facts, agrees to give him a full equivalent, and while the settler is unable to retract, for his own nse, the immediate subject of the disposition, he is assisted by the law in doing that which is equally beneficial to himself, and equally injurious in disappointing the object of his former bounty.

Settlements before marriage or In pursuance of previous Agreements.

Of void or $ 5. Of the considerations which sre sufficient to support a settlement against

valid Settle- the claims of creditors or subsequent purchasers, the first is marriage, and it K a

ments in respect settled principle, that any settlement made previous to marriage, or after marriage, of the Con- in pursuance of a written contract before, is valid; and can only be impeached on

the ground of deceit and actual fraud, of which, as stated in Campion r. Carton, 17 Ves. 268, referred to in the preceding part of this note, no instance has occurred by which any settlement has been in fact defeated.

Whether a settlement after marriage, in pursuance of a parol promise before* and proved only by the subsequent acknowledgement of the .party, is of equal efficacy, is a question which does not appear to be conclusively settled.

In Griffin v. Stanhope, Cro. Jac. 454, the husband having before marriage promised to assure to the wife a jointure of £1000, and having after marriage demised lands to trustees for 100 years, if the wife should so long live, in trust for her—with an indorsement declaring that the same should be void upon settling a jointure according to the first agreement—it was ruled, that the lease being made in pursuance of the first promise, although there was not any mention of any lease to be made, yet it was grounded upon a good consideration and not fraudulent, in Lavender r. Blackstone, 2 Lev. 146, a settlement was, under the particular circumstance, adjudged to be fraudulent—and upon this point it was said, that although it was proved that upon the marriage the husband promised to settle his estate when he came to twenty-one upon himself and hia issue, (which was agreed to be a sufficient consideration to avoid fraud, although infants are not bound by law to perform such, promises,) yet the settlement not having been made until three or four yean after he came of age, and not being directly according to the promise, should not be presumed to have been made in performance of the promise without direct proof thereof.

The provirion of the Statute of Frauds, 29 Ch. 2, c. 3, § 3, is, that no* action shall be brought to charge any person upon any agreement made in consideration of marriage, unless there be a note in writing signed by the party—but it would seem, that the execution of such an agreement, in pursuance of the moral obligation anting from it, would be as valid in respect to its incidental consequences, as the execution •f the promise referred to in the preceding case. In the Countess of Moatscue r. Maxwell, 1 Str. 235, a bill was sustained to compel a settlement pursuant to a verbal promise before marriage, supported by a letter after. The decree was on the ground of fraud, hut the Lord Chancellor said, “ A parol promise on marriage is sufficient consideration to support a settlement made agreeably to it after marriage. This has been frequently determined. So it is also sufficient consideration to establish > promise made in writing after marriage.*’ The case has no immediate reference to the statute of fraudulent conveyances, but it is only in respect to these that the observation can be understood to have been made, as there art no other grounds of objection against which a settlement after marriage can require support from collateral circumstances. The report of this case, 1 P. Wms. 618, refers to a different stage of the cause. In an anonymous case, Prec. Ch. 181, a second marriage settlement was recited to be made in consideration that the wife had parted with the former settlement, which appeared to be made after the marriage, but was I'ecited to te mode in consideration of a marriage portion, but there was no proof of any previous agreement for such settlement; yet the Court presumed it, and so the second was not voluntary against bond creditors. The above extract is the whole of the report, and certainly appears too scanty to warrant any decisive inferences being drawn

from it.

The case of Dundas r. Dutens, 1 Ves. jun. 196, was decided on the ground of the bill being fraudulently filed, at the instance of the husband, with a view to cheat his children. It was the case of stock belonging to the wife, settled after marriage, the settlement reciting a parol agreement made before marriage. Lord Thurlow aid, “ If there is a parol agreement for a settlement upon marriage, after marriage a suit upon the ground of part performance would not do, because the statute is expressed in that manner—but is there any case where in the settlement the parties recite an agreement before marriage, in which it has been considered, within the

And see upon this subject Randall v. Morgan, 12 Ves. 67.

It is very obvious, that if a mere recital, in a settlement after marriage, that it was made in pursuance of a previous parol agreement, is sufficient to sustain the settlement against creditors or purchasers, a very easy plan a laid down for giving effect 'to settlements, even if the recital should be wholly false, as the negative would in generd he vt»7 difficult of proof; and if the recital in a single settlement will not *be sufficient, there seetf1 to be very little reason in the distinction, that the making one aettlement with such ripwl, and ebandoning it for i mteequent eetdemeat,

* hall carry the matter any farther., - .

There is a rule of the civil law, that Qul non prw* which is evidently founded upon just principles, and is immcaw*1/ applicable to the point in question.

It seems not to be absolutely settled how far the limitations in s marriage settle- Marriage Bet* ment in favour of collateral objects not within the marriage consideration, are valid dements as af--as against subsequent purchasers churning under the statute 27 Elia, the setdement focting collate-not being supported by any other distinct and independent consideration. For ral objects# instance, whether upon a marriage by J. . a setdement of his estates in favour of his brother, in failure of issue by the marriage, is without other circumstances valid, as against a purchaser from J. .

In the case of St. Saviour's in Southwark, (4 Jas. 1.) Lane 22, it is reported as a resolution, that if a man upon the marriage of one of his sons covenants to stand seised to the use of that son for life, and then to the use of his other sons in remainder, such limitations to the ocher sons are void against a purchaser.

In Jenkins v, Kemishe, Hardrea, 395, 1 Lev. 150, Sir N. K. being tenant for life, with remainder to his son Charles, in tail, they suffered a recovery upon the marriage of Charles; and in consideration of the marriage and a portion, aetded the estate upon the husband and wife, with remainder to the heirs of the body of the husband by the wife, with remainder to the heirs of the body of the wife; and it was ruled, that the limitation to the heirs of the body of the son by a second wife wan good against a mortgage by Sir N. and Charles, and by Hale, (£ Baron, it is hard to presume fraud in this case, for none is found. And the consideration of marriage, and the marriage portion, will run to all the estates raised by the setdement, although the marriage is not concerned in them so as to make them good against purchasers, and avoid a voluntary conveyance; and it appears, upon the same case coming before the Court of Chancery upon another poiat, that Lord Keeper Bridgeman held thattha consideration of the portion paid on the first marriage extended to the issue of the

In Osgood v. Strode, 2 P. Willms. 245, which was a suit for carrying into execution articles ef agreement against volunteers, and decided upon grounds not con-xiected with the present discussion, some doubt appears to be thrown upon the general question. In Bellingham r. Lowther, 1 Ch. Css. 243, the Court refused to enforce performance of covenants in a marriage setdement in favour of collateral relations, although the party himself was preparing to execute them in his life time, and prevented by death. But it was said by the Court, that if the wife, who was a purchaser under the articles, had applitd, they must have specifically carried them into execution, and as it seemed, they must have been integrally executed for dm benefit of all collateral objects, as well as for the wife, and the issue of the marriage,

In Vernon v. Vernon, 2 P. Wms. 594, an agreement was enforced in favour of

brothers, the Lord Chancellor saying, that no creditor could be hurt by a specific performance. Mr. Roberts citing this case, says, that the Lord Chancellor was dearly of opinion that such an agreement ought not to be performed against a creditor; — hut nothing of this kind appears in the report. See also Edwards v. the Countess of Warwick, 2 P. Wms. 171—Goring v. Nash, 3 Atk. 188—Stephens v. Trueman,

1 Ves. 73, as to the execution of articles in favour of collaterals against volunteers g but even if it should be dearly established that a Court of Equity would refuse to decree in favour of such artides against creditors or purchasers, that will not affect the case of an actual setdement with reference to the statutes at present under consideration. In Ithell r. Beane, 1 Ves. 215, a bond previous to marriage to pap £400 amongst the children of the marriage, and a son then living by a former marriage, was sustained in favour of the son (there being no issue of the marriage) against the creditors of the father.

In Jason v. Jervis, 1 Vern. 284, the validity of a settlement as against a purchaser, was sent to be tried at law; first against the wife as to her estate for life; and then as to the remainders to the children; —“ for (by the Lord Keeper) if the bond before marriage [which is not noticed in the statement of the case] was only for a jointure, and the settlement goes further, and entails the land upon the children of the marriage, the settlement might be'good as to the jointure, and fraudulent as to the remainders in respect to a purchaser.” There are, in fact, many authorities which It is unnecessary particularly to advert to, that a settlement may be partly good and partly void.

A marriage in Scotland, according to the Scotch law, of persons going from England for the purpose, being valid; a settlement previous to, and in consideration of a subsequent marriage in England, is within the statute.—Ex parte Hall, 1 V. & B. H2.

A settlement after marriage is primd facie void, os against creditors intitled te the general protection of the statutes and purchasers, but may be supported upon a new consideration, of which the several cases about to be cited are instances; and it may be premised as a settled principle, that where there is a settlement founded upon actual consideration affecting the interest of any of the parties, the adequacy or inadequacy of such consideration, in point of value, is immaterial, for the mere nominal consideration of 6a. or 10s. inserted as matter of form in all assurances, is in this respect not regarded, the real nature of it being folly recognised and understood. The cases upon this subject may be divided as follows:—1. When a father is tenant for life, with remainder to.the son in tail, the father’s joining in the settlement by suffering a recovery, will support the limitations against the creditors, [ac comme semble the purchasers from the son) Russell v. Hammond, 1 Atk. 13, (already cited on other points)—but in Goodright v. Moses, 2 BL 1019, where J. R. being tenant for life, with remainder to Elizabeth, the wife of T. H. in tail; —the said parties levied a fine to the use of J. R. for life, and after with intent that the fCnts might be applied for the support of T. H. his wife and their children, during the life of T. H. afterwards for the maintenance of Elizabeth and her children during tier life; and after her decease for the children; these limitations were not sustained against a lease from Elizabeth after she became a widow. Lord Cji. J. De Grey delivering the opinion of the Court generally, that the deed was only a voluntary conveyance within the statute 27 Elia, being founded only upon a good, and not a valuable consideration; and that therefore it could not be set up against a bona fide purchaser. It may be observed, that in this case the settlement derived no assistance from the concurrence of J. R. as tenant in taiL in remainder, that can bar his issue by fine, without the asfccnt of the tenant for life. —2. Where the settlement is made upon an additional portion paid or agreed to be paid by the friends of the wife, which is a good pecuniary consideration, as to which see Russell v. Hammond, 1 Atk. 13, already cited upon other paints, Jones v. Marsh, Ca. Temp. Tail. 64. Browne v. Jones, 1 Atk. 188. Stileman v. Ashdown, 2 Atk. 477, and this, as it appears, although the sum agreed to be paid is not paid in fret. Lord Hardwicke, in Rarasden v. Hilton, 2 Vts. 309, assigns as a reason for this, that the issue take from both parties, and whether they perform their agreement among themselves, may be immaterial to the issue. Mr. Roberts observes, 'p. 258, that it is not very easy to comprehend the force of this reasoning; but without entering Into that discussion, nothing is more obvious, than that a mere agreement of one person may be an adequate consideration for either a counter agreement, or an executed act of another.—3.

In the case of Roe on the Demise of Hamerton v. Mittoo, 2 Wfla. 356, already cited, the settlement before marriage was assumed to be voluntary so far as related to the brothers, except so far as depended upon the circumstance of the mother joining, was decided to be made upon valuable consideration, in respect of the mother abandoning the security for her annuity upon the whole estate, and accepting a security of part; and this decision appears to be founded upon a general principle, and not particularly to depend upon its having any reference to marriage.

There is a class of £ases respecting settlements made previous to a second msr- Settlements riage upon children by a first, which seem rather to depend upon general principles previous to a of equity as applicable to actual fraud than to the peculiar doctrine established by second Mar-the statutes at present under consideration, and which therefore it will not be mate- riage for Chil-rial more particularly to advert to .

betng s voluntary conveyance it is void against the creditors of Gilei«M Mr. Roberta, in a note to his citation of this case (page 415,) observes, u That the settlement of disputed boundaries, and in general the object of removing contention and compromising advene claims, constitute a good consideration to support suits in equity Car the specific performance of agreements, *' and refen to the opinion of Lord Hard* wicke, in Penn o. Lord Baltimore, 1 Vesey, 453—but adds, w That it seems dear, that such considerations will not be good against persons coming in upon valuable considerations, ” and in a subsequent passage (page 432,) he refen to Peat t*. Powell, as establishing, that a vain apprehension of possible danger, or an alarm existing by groundless menaces, will not form a valuable consideration for a conveyance. But in Hill, clerk, v. the Bishop of Exeter and others, 2 Taunton, 69, Charles Hill, tbs father, made a voluntary conveyance to his son of the living of Fremington, and afterwards, upon the trial of a Quart impedit, at the suit of R.C. claiming the vacant presentation, against May and others, it was agreed that May should release to Caote his title to the presentation, and to C. H. his right to the advowson—C H. coneenr-ing thereto, and agreeing to present May or his assigns at the next vacancy; tad, in pursuance thereof, Hill and Cooke released to May the next advowson. To m plea setting forth such release. Hill replied, that May had not any right whatever to the advowson—which replication was upon demurrer adjudged to be bad—and it was held that May was, under such release, a purchaser for valuable conuderation, o as to defeat the voluntary conveyance to Hill, the son—and per Curiam. It is just the same thing whether May bad or had not any actual tide, for ha gave up whatever he had, and therefore it is quite immaterial what he had—and there can be no doubt, in general, that the giving up a right without fraud is a valuable consideration—the relessor parts with that for which the other party may very reasonably give money.” This case, deciding that such a compromise is a valuable ooooriden-tion, which defeats a former voluntary conveyance, will apply a fortion, at will appear in the sequel, to shew that a conveyance, founded upon such consideration, cannot be impeached in itself as being merely voluntary.

' A conveyance in trust for payment of the debts of the party making as Dot, without other circumstances, sufficient to prevent the operation of the statutes, as to which see Lord Paget’s case, 1 Leon. 194—Leech v. Leech, Ch. Cas. 249— Tarback ». Marbury, 2 Vera. 510; but if a creditor be a party to such conveyance, and enters into any agreement for forbearance, or to release his debt, it is dearly as Mr. Roberts observes (p. 431,) a valuable consideration:and in Langton R Tracey, 1 Cb. Rep.33, it was ruled, that such a conveyance, though no creditor warn a party, was good against a creditor with notice.

In Twine’* case, 3 Rep. 83, a case was cited by Anderson, Ch. J. in which a man of weak understanding, and incapable of managing an estate, and being given to riot, by the mediation of his friends, openly conveyed his lands to them upon trust, to take the profits and apply them to his maintenance, in order to prevent fads wasting and consuming the same—which was supported against a subsequent purchaser for a small value, the purchaser being apparently open to the imputation of fraud and deceitj but the Chief Justice observed, “ That such a conveyance is void as to him who purchases the land for a valuable consideration bona fide without deceit or cunning.”

Not eaential that the void Conveyance should be made by the Party from whom the Purchaser derives title.

§ 6. It is not essential that the conveyance which is impeached aa fraudulent, Should be made by the same person from whom the purchaser derives his rick. Thai was laid down in BurreFs case, 6 Rep. 72, where a father upon the marriage of him son, demised lands to the son for 1000 years, and the-eon in the life-tone of Jha* father made an assignment to his own son, an infant, which was under the circumstances held to be fraudulent, and after the death of his hither sold the land, covenanting that it was free from all leases—and two points are reported as resolved; lac. That if a father make a lease by fraud and covin of his land, in order to defraud others to whom he may demise or sell it (as all fraudulent leases shall be intended,) and before the father makes any sale or demise he dies, and the son knowing or not 2:opwing of the case sells the land upon good consideration, in this case the vendor shall avoid the lease by force of the statute, (27 Elis.) for as it is intended aad presumed in law that every fraudulent lease is made with the intent generally to defraud purchasers, farmers, &c. in this generality every particular porcfcmor, "Runner, &c. is included—and the Act is well penned, for the words of the Act 'are general, and do not require that he who sells the land shall make the fraudulent estate or incumbrance, but if the estate be fraudulent, Ac.c. whoever sells it, the purchaser shall avoid such fraudulent estate; and aa in the case at bar, the two leases were upon the evidence thought fraudulent, the vendee of the heir mig^st avoid them.—2d. That although the son had nothing in the inheritance at the tkmm

Class VII.] Fraudulent Conveyances. 373

of the assignment of the term, hut all the estate of inheritance was in his father; yet when the father died and the son sold the land, his vendee shall avoid the term,

(the assignment being taken upon the evidence to be fraudulent) for if he had bargained and sold the term only the bargainee might have avoided the fraudulent assignment, and consequently the vendee of the whole fee may avoid it.

Tn'Cleric v. Rutland, Lane 113, a father made a lease to a stranger for forty years, and continued in possession, and afterwards conveyed the lands to a younger son, who sold it for a valuable consideration; and it was doubted whether the purchaser could avoid the lease; but it was said, that if in that case the father had suffered the land to descend to his eldest son, then the purchaser from the eldest son should avoid the lease. In Jones v. Purefoy, 1 Vem. 45, the grandfather made a settlement on the grandson, which was disputed by the mortgagee of the father after the grandfather’s death; but as to this point, sava the reporter, they gave this clear answer:—* It was true it was a voluntary settlement, and if it had been made by the person that mortgaged these lands, it should never prevail against a purchaser; but here the settlement was made by the grandfather, and the estate passed from him; but the mortgage was made by the father, who was never seised nor possessed of the estate.’ *

According to the present understanding upon the subject, it is not probable that n mere voluntary lease msde by a father could be avoided by the alienee of the son, to whom the inheritance had descended, or that the son could by this circuity avoid a disposition of his father, if made by deed, which would be effective against heirs if made by wilL This observation does not affect the case where the deed is affected by actual fraud according to the popular and common, notion of the term.

$ 7. Some doubts have been entertained as to whether copyholds are within the Copyholds, statute 27 Eliz. respecting purchasers, but the prevailing opinion seems to be that they are.—See Doe, Demise of Watson v. Rout]edge, Cowp. 705.—Mr. Roberts justly observes, that how for surrenders of copyholds are within the Statute 13 Elis, with respect to creditors may perhape be doubted, since it may be said that they have not the effect of delaying hindering or defrauding creditors who cannot issue process to levy a debt upon a copyhold estate —and notwithstanding that, it has been determined not to be an act of bankruptcy on a similar ground.—Esparto Cockshot, pa. 447, ft.

$ 8. A purchase originally made in the name and fo(the use of third persons Purchases in does not fall directly within the operation of these statutes. Lady Gorge's Case, Cro. the name and Car. 550. How far such purchases may be affected by the general rules of courts of far the use of equity under particular circumstances is a question foreign to the present enquiry, third Persons, they are expressly within the Sutute 1 Jac. 1. c. 21, respecting Bankrupts, and 13 Elis. c. 4, respecting the debts of the King’s accountants.

§ 9. Conveyances originally defeasible foay become valid by circumstances oc- Conveyances curring subsequently. In Prodgers v. Langham, 1 Sid. 133, it is laid down, that grimily fa. although a deed be fraudulent in its creation, and voidable by a purchaser, yet it may renderbecome good by matter ex part facto—ex if a man makes a feoffment by covin, and rajjd by the feoffee makes a feoffment over upon valuable consideration, the feoffee of the flm.nent argum-first feoffee shall retain the land, and not the feoffee of the first feoffor. See also to the same effect, Andrew Newport's case, Skinner, 423—. C. by the name of Swartle v. Williams, 3 Ley. 387—Wilson v. Wormal, Godb. 161.

In the before mentioned case of Prodgers v. Langham, a voluntary settlement upon a daughter was supported by the daughter’s subsequent marriage. So in Kirk v. Clark, Prec. Ch. 275, where the father told the friends of the son’s wife, thit he had already settled the premises upon the son—and an express settlement wss also made of other premises. So where a daughter, in whose favour a settlement was made, married a person of fortune, who was before marriage advised by counsel, that the portion wss sufficiently secured.—E. I. Company v. Clivel, Free. Ch. 377— and see the Observations in Doe v, Routledge, Cowp. 705.

Ait the conveyance it good aa against a subsequent voluntary settlement upon wife or childten.—Needham and Beaumont's case, 3 Rep. 83. 233.—Ufcxon v. Aw set, Cro.

Routkdge, Cowp. 705—although mere inadequacy may* not be an objection. A purchaser for valuable consideration under a second voluntary conveyance-, cannot impeach the title under the first. Dame Burg’s case, Moor, 833, where a person having a real lease for sixty years forged a lease for ninety, which he sold withr afl. hie interest in the land, it was ruled that as he did not contract for'die trod and'lawful interest, which was not known, he was not a purchaser within the statutes—al* though by the general words the true interest would pass.—Co. Lit. 36.

Mr. Roberts observes, that irmsy be doubted whether that constructively valuable consideration, which has in some cases singly prevailed, in others cumulatively tended to support precedent conveyances against subsequent purchasers, will arm the purchaser against a prior-voluntary deed, with power sufficient to overthrow it, p. 388. From the general tenor of the cases I should conceive that it evidently would not, especially according to the opinions-which have been recently expressed with regard to the true construction of the statute considered independently of authority.

Of Powers of $ 11. Upon the 5th section of 27. Elia, respecting powers of revocation, the fMRtvocmtion. lowing points have occurred :—It does not extend to the power of charging the ee *

tate with a particular sum of' money—Jenkins v. Keymis, 1 Lev. 150. It extends to aO cases where in effect the power is given to the grantor, although accompanied by a colourable condition, as the payment of a small sum of money to a stranger, or the consent of a third person merely appointed by the grantor—Cross v. Eauatep* ditch, Cro. Jac. 180—Tarback v. Marbury, 2 Vem. 510—Griffin v. Stanhope, Qo. Jac. 454—Lavender v. Blacks ton, 3 Keble, 526, and see 3 Rep. 82; but It is otherwise when the money it to be paid to trustees, to be vested in other estates—Dee v. Martin, 4 T. R. 39; or where the consent required is that of a third person, fond fide, appointed by all parties.—See Leigh v. Winter, 1 Jones, 411—Buller v. Water-house, Sir Thos. Jones, 94, 3 Keb. 75.—Hungerford v. Earle, 2 Freem. 120. .It in immaterial that the settlement containing the power of revocation is made upon valuable consideration —as to which see Roberts, 637—Siigden on Powers, 338. If a person, having power to revoke at a future day, conveys upon valuable consideration before the day, the settlement will be void from the time when be might revoke.—Bullock v. Thorne, Moor, 611—Twyne's case, 3 Rep. 82—Garth r. Enfield, Bridge, 22. The statute operates, although the power is previously released—Bullock «. Thorne, Moor, 616—but it may be otherwise if the release was for valuable consideration, or the purchaser had notice. It seems that the statute does not operate, if the grantor by the conveyance professes to execute the power of revoca-, don, and doee so informally, —See Sugden on Powers, ch. 8, from* which this paragraph is abridged.

Lends firando-lently aliened descends as Assets.

H. still remained seised as to creditors by covin— Humbert on v. HOwgil; Hob. 72. See also Shep. Touch. 66.

Ita ParslOw t*. Weedon, Eq. Ab. Creditor and Debtor, E. pL 7, Lord Macclesfield is reported to have said, that any settlement or disposition which a man makes inhis life-time, whether voluntary or not, shall be good against creditors, for that was not provided against by the statute against fraudulent devises—but a strong dissatisfaction was expressed with this opinion, in Brunsden v. Sttatton, Prec. Ch. 521—Jones v. March, Ca. Temp. Talb. 64—where the Lord Chancellor said, that Mr. Vernonf had always grumbled at the determination of that case, and never forgave Lord Macdeafield: saying, it was contrary to the constant practice of the Court. It is dear that the statute of fraudulent devises, to winch Lord Macclesfield referred, wax wholly foreign to the subject* which depended upon the common law and the statutes at present under contemplation. The statute of fraudulent devises left* the lew as to deeds as it stood before, and the principle to be collected from all the authorities is, that if a deed>was void against creditors in its inception, it does.not become valid by the death of the maker.

§ 13. With reepeet to amigmneiiin of pemonal property, (independently of any Of AmignmeWl consideration founded upon actual fraud, with respect to which erery caae resolves Personal itself into'a matter of fact) the retention of possesion of the property assigned, js, property, generally peaking, held to induce a legal presumption of frauds—In Twyne's case, .

3 Rep - 80, the retention of possession by the vendor of the goods, was only regarded amongst the circumstances-as constituting a badge and fraud; hut in Edwards v. Har* ben, % Term Rep. 587, it was established m a general rule, that, unless praamsion accompanies, and follows the deed, it is fraudulent and void. This is subject Co exceptions incases when the retention of the possession of the goods is consistent with that object of the deed; —it in cases of goods settled, upon marriage, (as to which see Lid Cadogan and Kenaett, Gowp. 432) and in other cases, referred to in the judg~ moot, of Edwards and Harfcen. The actual delivery of the goods may be dispensed with when the nature of the subject renders it impracticable; or when Acts havo taken place which are. equivalent, as in case of assignment of goods at sea, the pipes documents being doltvered over; —the delivery of thi key of a warehouse in which that gpods ire containedend other cases which have frequently been decided, with, reference to the bankrupt laws; as to which it may be observed, that* whatever insufficient to avoid the effect of the* statute of James, concerning reputed ownerships applies a fortion to repel the imputation of a fraud from a retention of possession in respect to the statute 13 Elis. c. 5 *

In Dewey e. Baynton, 6 East. 257, pictures and other property at Wendowes Castle, belonging to Lord Arundel, were, in consideration of Lady Arundel relinquishing some interests under a settlement in favour of Lord Arundel, assigned to trustees for the separate use of Lady A. and they continued in possession of Lord A. without any inventory. In an action against the sheriff for a false return, it was left, te the jury, whether the trust deeds were a contrivance to defraud Lord A.’s creditors,

—or whether they were, a bona fide transaction and a verdict being found in favoun

of the transaction} a new trial was granted in order to bring that point more distinctly before the juryhut it is manifestly the opinion of the Court, that the mere pomes sion of the husband being consistent with the- object of the deeds, was not in itself, sufficient to annul the transaction, so as to render the goods liable to an execution, at. the suit of the creditors of *Lord A.—The jury upon the second trial having found a verdict for the creditor, upon an application for an injunction, the Lord Chancellor, expressed his opinion very fully in favour of the general nature of the transaction j. and directed a. trial in the Common Pleas for the purpose of settling the question.—

Lady Arundel e. Phipps, 10 Vesey, 139, It is however not very easy to discern any; ground of equity upon which the Court of Chancery were authorised in this case to exercise a controul over the proceedings of a court of law, upon what was considered' by itself so entirely illegal question as to be referred to another court of law fax it* decision. The. ultimate event at the case does not appear in the books.

The expression of accompanying and following the deeds, which is applied to theL dam. of cases at present under dismission, requires some consideration with respect to its import and extent; and I take it never to have been held, that the mere octurrence of any interval of time between the execution of the deed and the taking of possession under it, shall at any subsequent period, however remote, be deemed sufficient to taint the transaction with fraud; and I would submit, that if the possession is taken in mere pursuance of the deed, before any other rights or interests have intervened, and at a period when the entire transaction would have been valid.and effectual, such possession would be sufficient; and this seems to be implied by the case of Jones v. Dwyer,

15 East; 21, where goods lying at a wharf were purchased in December, and an order given for their delivery, and no transfer was obtained upon such order until the June following, which being before the bankruptcy of the seller, the Court decided in favour of the title of the vendee.—The statute of 13th Elis, was referred to; but the discussion principally leaned upon the statute 21 Ja. 1. respecting reputed ownerships in . cases of bankruptcy.

The cases upon the statute of 13 Elis, relates only to property assigned without delivery of pomemion from the person to whom it originally belonged; for it is perfectly clear, that the mere possession of personal property concludes nothing with respect to the right.

And when there has been bona fide a notorious charge of property, the subsequent possession of the goods by the person to whom they-belonged, it does not bring the - case within the statute; accordingly in Cole v. Davies, 1 Lord Raymond, 724, it was said by Holt, Ch. Just, that the goods of A are seised upon fi. fa. and sold to B bona fide upon valuable consideration, though B permitted A to have goods in hie possession,

37B

Fraudulent Conveyances.

[Part IIupon condition that A should pa y to B the money n he ahould raise k by sale of the goods, this will not make the execution fraudulent; and in such cast, a subsequent act of bankruptcy will not prevent the sale.

[Non] In this case the provision respecting reputed ownership, in case of bankruptcy, is not sufficiently attended to.

And in the modern case of Kidd v. Rawlinson, 2B.&P. 59, the goods of A being taken under an execution, were purchased at a public auction by B, who suffered A to continue in possession, and to carry on business, and A having afterwards executed a bill of sale of the goods to C, it was ruled that B was entitled to them as against C; and it was laid down that if B had lent A money to buy the goods, and had taken a conveyance of them, or a security for his debt—this arising out of the mere fact of lending his money, leaving Ain possession of the goods—it would not have been a fraudulent act. And in a very late case, where a person assigned his effects to his trustees; and the son, in order to accommodate his mother*- became the purchaser of the household goods at a fair appraisement, and suffered the greater part of them to remain in the house with his mother, who continued to reside there, aM take lodgers as before; —k being found by the jury that the change of property was notorious, and that the assignment was not executed with an intent to defeat either the general body of creditor *, or any particular creditor; the title of the son was sustained against a subae quern execution by a creditor of the father, Leonard v. Baker, 1M.&. 251. See nbo on this point. Bull. N. P. 258. Meggitt v. Mills, 1 Ld. Harm. 286. and the late case of Reed o. Blades, 5 Taunt. 212. Watkins v. Birch, 4 Taunt. 823. Mair «w Glennie, 4 M. & . 248. Reed v. Blades, 5 Taunt. 212.

It is agreed, that an actual intention to defraud creditors will be sufficient to invalidate a transaction, which in other respects would be good. Without entering into on enumeration of the cases applicable to this subject, I shall barely refer to Cadogan .«. Kennett, Cowp. 432, in which, upon a settlement of goods made previous to marriage, Lord Mansfield said—u The question in every case is, whether the Act done is a bona Jide transaction, or whether it is s trick and contrivance to defeat creditors.— And Lord Ellenborough in Dewey, v. Baynton, 6 East. 257, already referred to, left the question to the jury in the precise terms cited from Cadogan and Kennett, and the principle was recognised by the court, though a new trial was granted for the pur-i of bringing the facts more distinctly before the jury. See the observations of A Eldon on this subject, in Lady Arundel r. Phipps, 10 Vesey, 139.

See Estwick v. Cailland, 5 T. R. 420, in which a conveyance by Lord Abingdon of retl and personal property in trust, after deducting expences to pay one moiety of the profits to Lord A. for his own use, and the other to certain creditors named in schedule, was held good, the intention of fraud as against the other creditors bring negatived by the jury. There was in this case some apparent possession in Lord sifter the deed, which the Court thought sufficiently explained. BuUer I. observed, Fraud is sometimes a question of law, sometimes a question of fact, and sometimes m mixed question of law and fact. On the whole it appears to me, that the deed, taken by itself, is a good and valid one; and that there are no extrinsic circumstances to shew that any fraud was intended.' *

(1) It t« not the Editor's intention to enter into a dissertation upon the extensive system of law which has arisen from the present Statute, and which forms one of the most important branches of the doctrine of real property.

The general doctrines arising from the Statute are exhibited in Lord Bacon's Reading on the Statute—in Gilbert's Law of Uses and Trusts— Mr. Sander's Treatise on vhe same subjeor — Mr. Cruise's Chapters on those subjects In his Digest of the Law of Conveyances, and which are also published in a separate form—Mr, Sugden's Treatise on the Law of Powers. The notes of the gentleman last mentioned have given great value to his edition of Gilbert; but it certainly would have been more satisfactory to the present Annotator, if, in lieu of that edition, he had presented the public with an original work upon the subject, according to his own arrangement, availing himself of the work which he has edited as supplying a valuable repertory of materials.

For a less extensive view of the subject, it is impossible that any thing could be offered more satisfactory than the information contained in Blackstone's Commentaries, vol, II. ch. 20, p. 327.

The well-known observation that a Statute made upon great deliberation, and introduced in the most solemn manner, has had little other effect than to make a alight alteration in the formal words of a conveyance, Vaughan 50. 1 Atk. 591. 2 Bl. Com. 336, is certainly not quite warranted by the fact, as it is manifest, that in conssquenee of the Statute, many modifications of real property have been introduced for the convenience of families, of which the common law was not susceptible; and how little soever the retention of what was formerly known by the name of Uses, under the substituted appellation of Trusts, may have been warranted upon the true principles of judicial construction, it certainly baa been attended in many respects with considerable practical convenience.

One of the most important questions, with relation to the doctrine of Uses, is upon, the effect of a limitation to such uses as a party shall appoint, and in default of appointment; and in the mean time until appointment to himself and hia heirs, with respect to the claim of dower againtc the appointee under the power. The great weight of professional and judicial opinion is certainly in favour of the validity of the appointment, as opposed to the Aim of dowerthe discussion on this point by Lord Eldon, in the case of Maun-drell v. Maundrell, 10 Vea. 246, would seem to preclude all reasonable hesitation upon the question { but from a deference to other opinions which had been incidentally thrown out to the contrary, his Lordship concluded with treating it as a question still open to inquiry; and thb mode of conveyancing, which was formerly very gene-mi, has, from the doubts which have been suggested respecting it, entirely gWen way to a limitation with the intervention of a trustee, by which the right of dower is absolutely prevented.

Nothing certainly sen be more striking than the inconsistency of* the doctrine which flobjeoM trust estates tothe right by courtesy, while it exempts them from the claim of the dower. The following observations or Lord Redesdale, in D'Arcy v. Blake, 2 8chelee.fr LefiWy, 388, seem to give the true account of the origin of the distinction: “ Hie difficulty in which the Courts of Equity have been involved with respect t«» dower, I apprehend originally arose thus:they had assumed ss a principle in acting upon mats, to follow the law; and according to this principle, they ought in all cases wheie right* attached as legal estates, to have attached the same rights upon trusts; and consequently to have given dower of an equitable estate. It was found, however, that in eases of dower, this principle, if pursued to the utmost, would affect the titles to a laigs proportion of estates in the country, for(tj^£)gqnries had been acting on the footing of dower upon a cootr-principle, and had supposed, that by the cr

of a trust, the right of dower would be prevented from attaching. Many persona had purchased under this ides; and the country would have been thrown into the utmost confusion, if Courts of Equity bad followed their general rule with respect to trusts in the cases of dower. But the same objection did not apply to tenancy by the courtesy; for no person would purchase an estate subject to the tenancy by the courtesy, without the concurrence of the person in whom that right was vested.

The consequence of adopting the present mode of conveyancing, in preference to that first men* tinned, mis perhaps not been sufficiently attended to, with respect te its influence on the comforts of families, and the fair expectations of persons engaged in marriage; for although a freedom of disposition is an important object in the acquisition of property, the affording to a widow the original provision of the law, when the husband has shown no intention to the contrary, would be much more beneficial to the community than the mere advantage to the heir (a person probably unknown to his ancestor) upon the oppoti trays-tern. Considering the reasonableness of the provision itself on the one band, and the disadvantage which met from rendering the right to that provision so absolute as not to be subject to the controul of the owner of the property—and tilt consequent expedients leading to an absolute deprivation of the right, on the other—the subject seems to be fairly worthy of legislative attention; and the Editor submits that it would be very beneficial to pspvide, that in all cases it should be lawful lor any person seised of an estato in fee to dispose thateof| and that the same should be subject to all bis debts and charges, free from any claim of dower, with the exception of estates to which the title shall arise by descent or devise or marriage settlement during the coverture; and by way of compensariM to admit widows to their dower of trust estates, subject to any dilutions of the husband. Perhaps it might not be an injudicious addition (although the observation does not arise immediately out of the subject which it properly before me) to extend the benefit of dower and courtesy to the cases of freehold leases; and to dhpetue with the necessity of having issue as a condition for tenancy by the courtesy.

The power of a party lieir.g only tenant for life by a wrongful conveyance such is a fine or feoffment, to acquire an absolute title to the inheritance to the prejudice of those who may be evidently entitled to ulterior intents, it certainly no very desirable ingredient of our legal system;

and hi all cases, is the mere result of s deficiency of style in framing the instruments under which the estate is derived: this power does not exist with respect to trust or copyhold estates, and I apprehend that it would be an improvement in the law to dispense with the services of the perries intrusted with the imaginary duties of

quire, '* fior the purpose of supporting contingent remainders, by a general provision, that no estate or interest in remainder should be affected or prejudiced by any fine feoffment or other wrongful act of tenant fior life, or by any union of the tenancy fir life with the ulterior reversion. This principle was acted upon by statute 10 Si 11 w. 3. c. 16. to enable posthumous children to take estates as if born in their parents’ life-time; (ante Class I. No. 22.) previous to which a limitation to trustees was necessary for the preservation of an intermediate freehold; and k is impossible to suppose that any prejudice can arise from an alteration of the law which will have the effect of preventing the intentions of the party from whom the property is derived being defeated in consequence of the omission of a mere technical expression. Betides the general mischief already alluded to, against which such a provision would afford a remedy, the mischief of the power of devise by tenant in remainder being defeated by a fine of the preceding tenant for life would be effectually obviated.

The Legislature has in the statutes forming one of the preceding Clasmt, (Vide Clam VI.) applied a remedy to the inconvenience arising from estates in trust being vested in infants or lunatics. It would be a very beneficial extension of the same principle to provide for the case of the absence or uncertainty of the person in whom such trust estates were vested, by enabling courts of equity upon petition to authorise a proper officer to execute a conveyance of the trust estate. This subject might require distinct consideration si applied to the cases of mere trusts as instruments of conveyancing, and trusts attended with actual confidence in the individuals; hut 1 apprehend that considerable benefit, unaccompanied with any inconvenience, would arise from making the provision general.

The principle of such a provision has lwen already applied by the Legislature to the case of personal estates, by stat. Geo. J11. c. 90, with respect to money in the funds: \nd f find that by the Irish statute 28 Geo. IJT^. 35. provisions of the nature here at^i^ed Bfcve weir actually adopted. 2 Gabbett, 358,

And a corporation -cannot take by conveyance to the use of another; but it seems that they may pass their own estates by conveyances operating only by the Statute of Uses—as by the common conveyance of lease by way of bargain and sale and release; and that the usual precautions of conveying by lease at common law, and actual entry, as the foundation of a release, or by feoffinent, are not necessary. See Sug. Note Gilb. [5.]

(3) By force of this word, which only extends to freehold interests, the statute does not affect assignments of terns of years, although a term may be newly created by conveyance operating under the statute, as is evident from the Common case of s bargain and sale for a year. See Gilb; [79.] The purpose of vesting a term of yean in a person already possessed thereof with others as joint-tenants, (as in the usual case of a change of trustees for public institutions) can only be accomplished by a previous assignment to a third person, and from such person to the original assignor in conjunction with others.

See Cheyney's case. Mo. 196. 2 And. 192. And where a termor for yean was made a tenant to the pnecipe, it was held, that although the freehold vested in him drowned the term until the

recovery was sufficient, yet when the recovery was perfected the term should* revive. Ferrers v, Ferro or, 2 Rol. Rep. 245. Cro. Jac. 643. Ter-rie's case, 1 Ventr. 200, cited.

residue of the lands tenements or hereditaments that at any time were g^* her said husband's, by whom she hath any such jointer, nor snail demand Co.^ Inst. 36 b. nor claim her dower of and against them that have the lands and inheandTrust *, 193, [86.]—“The statute has two provisions for the execution of rents:—the first for rents in esse limited to uses, which are executed in the flame manner as uses of corporeal hereditaments; —the other for rents limited in use out of the seisin in the land of some other, e. g. where any person stands seised of any to the use that some other person may receive a rent thereout, which the statute executes in the same manner as if a sufficient grant had been made to him by the person seised to the use, and gives the cestuique use a power of distress; tee 1 Mod. 223; 2 Mod. 138. This clause, it has been held, relates as well to rents limited since the statute as to rents then in esse, Dy. 362, b, pi. 21; Danby v. Conyers, 1 And. 51; Bendl. 315, pL 299; therefore if lands be conveyed to A and his heirs, to the use that B and hit heirs may receive a given rent, the use will be executed by the statute; but sny ulterior use would be void. Where a rent ia intended to be limited to uses in strict settlement, it is desirable to first grant it to a stranger in fee, to the intent that he may re-grant it to the intended uses; see Mr. Butlers n. to Co. Litt. 271, b; which avoids any question, whether distinct rents are granted; tee Whitfield v. Fausset, 1 Ves. 387:or it may be granted to a stranger to the uses at once; see Bascawen v. Cook, 1 Mod. 223; Cook v. Herle,

2 Mod. 138. .C.; although if limited by way of use to the stranger, the ulterior intended uses would be mere trusts; see Chaplin t1. Chaplin,

3 P. Wins. 229.

“ The meaning of the passage in the text is, that a rent cannot be granted by a. bargain and sale; that is, that a mere bargain and sale of a new rent would be void; but upon a conveyance of the estate itself by bargain and sale, a rent may be limited out of the estate created; for although a use had only passed by the common law, yet wow by thie statute the use and possession pass together, and so it amounts to a grant of the land itself. This was adjudged in Weeks v. Tillerd, Co. Litt. 144, a; Crow Elis. 595; and see Put-tenham’s case, 1 And. 18; and the reservation, a* if out of the estate executed by the statute, egill JWt be deemed a use upon a use, Cromwell's caae, post 200; Cholmley’* case, 2 Rep. 54t a; 2 lust. 673; Cro. Eli*. 595. This construction

appears to have depended on that clause in the Act, which executes rents where any person ia seised of land, to the intent that another may have a rent; and on the same principle in the case of Revitt v. Godson, 1 Jo. 179, where there was a covenant to stand seised in consideration of natural love, of certain lands to the use of the covenantor for life, with remainders over, and to the intent that his son should have a rent during hie father's life, it was decided by Dodridge, Jones, and Whitlock, that by the clause in 27 H. 8, where any one was seised to the intent that another should have a rent, the son in that case hid a good rent as well upon a covenant as a feoffment, so if a bargain and sale was rendering rent, that they said was within the clause, for which they referred to Cromwell's case. At first sight these caqps appear to establish that a rent may be newly granted by a bargain and sale or covenant to stand seised; but they merely decided that a rent maybe limited or reserved out of an estate actually raised by either of those conveyances, although they do not operate by transmutation of possession.

“ A new rent may, like the estate itself, be limited to commence infuturo within the line of perpetuity, because it hath no existence until that time, and so there is no suspension of any freehold; but it ia otherwise where an old rent is granted for life or in fee to commence tn future, for there the grant b void, because there b a rent in esse, and so the freehold of that rent will be suspended, and therefore such grant b void; Osr mere u. Sheafe, Carth. 307; and see Rex v. Kemp, 2 Salk. 465, 4th Resol.

“ It may still be observed, that although a mere tenancy in tail in land be created and the reversion be left in the donor, yet a recovery by the tenant in tail will bar as well the estate tsul as the reversion over; but a bare limitation of a rent upon its creation to one in tail, without a remainder over in fee, will not enable the donee to acquire more than a base fee in the rent, determinable upon failure of the issue; see Smith v. Farnaby, 2 Keb. 29, 55, 84:Weeks v. Peach, 2 Lutw. 1218; 2 Salk. 557; Chaplin t. Chaplin, 3 P. Wins. 229.

* For the general doctrines established with regard to this Act, I shall only refer to the authorities mentioned in the preliminary note to the preceding number. But think it proper more particularly to mention the opinion maintained by Mr. Fearne, in his reading on the present statute (inserted in his posthumous works) that a rent or reversion, which would not pass at common law by mere grant without attornment, cannot now pass by grant, although the necessity of attornment is taken away by Stat. 4XXAnne, c. 16, [ante Class I. No. 23.]--and that it is a conveyance of such interest as must be made either by leite and release, or by bargain and sale inrolled. This opinion appears to be evidendy erroneous, *nd is controverted by Mr. Sanders in his Treaie ou Uses, vol. 2, p. 39, and by Mr. Sugdcn,

in his note to Gilbert, [1 Oh] 226. The following -summary of the quesuon is extracted from the note just mentioned. “ The tiue state of the law seems to be simply this: the statute of in-rolments only extended to proper bargains and sales—a grant of a reversion was a common law conveyance, and not within the purview of it; because the necessity of attornment, which then existed, was equipollent to livery of seisin, where the estate was m possession. The statute of Anne took away the necessity of attornment to a gram of a reversion, but did not affect the operation of the grant itself, which still, as formerly, will as a common law conveyance transfer the reversion, and will now be sufficient without any

attornment of the tenant#/* ~

The Manner of levying of Fines. What Things be requisite to make them good, and who are bound by them.

WHEN the writ original is delivered in presence of the parties before justices, a pleader shall say this, Sir Justice, Conge, de accorder; and

* the justice shall say to him, What saith Sir R. and shall name one of the parties. Then when they be agreed of the sum of money that must be given to the King, then the justice shall say, Cry the Peace. And after the pleader shall say, In to much at peace it licensed that unto you W. and 4 A. hit wife, that here be, do acknowledge the manor of B. with the appvrtc- nances contained in the writ, to be the right of our lord the King, which he hath of their gift to have and to hold to him and hit heirt if the taid W. and A. and the heirt of A. at in demeans rents seigniories courts pleatpurchases wards marriages reliefs escheats mills advowsont if churches, and allotherfranchises and free customs to the said manor belonging, paying yearly to K. and kit heirs, as chief lords of the fee, the services and customs due for all services. And it is to be noted, that the order of the law will not suffer a final accord to be levied in the King's court without a writ original, and that

* must be at die least before Tour justices in the Bench, or in Eyre, and not elsewhere, and in presence of the parties named in the writ, < which must be of full age, of good memory, and out of prison. And if a woman covert be one of the parties, then she must be first examined by four of the said justices; and if she doth not assent thereunto, the fine shall not be levied. And the cause wherefore such solemnity ought to be done in a fine is, because a fine is so high a bar of so great force and of so strong nature in'itself, that it concludeth not only such as be parties and privies thereto and their heirs, but all other people of the world,

* being of full age, out of prison, of good memory, and within the four seas, 4 the day of the fine levied, if they make not their elaim of their action within a year and a day by the country. ’

And the said proclamations so had and made, the said fine to be a final end, and conclude as well privies as strangers to the same, except women covert (other than beta parties to the said fine) and every person then being within age of xxi. years, In prison, or out of this realm, or not of whole mind at the time of the said fine levied, not parties to such fine; and saving to every person or persons and to their heirs, other than the parties in the said fine, such right title claim and interest as they have to or in the said lands tenements or other hereditaments, the time of such fine ingrossed; so that they pursue their title claim or interest, by way of action or lawful entry, within five years next after the said proclamations had and made: And also saving to all other persons such action right title claim and interest in or to the said lands tenements or other hereditaments, as first shall grow remain or descend or come to them after the said fine ingrossed and proclamation made, by force of any gift in the tail, or by any other cause or matter had and made before the said fine levied; so that they take their action, or pursue their said right and title, according to the law, within five years next after such action right title claim or interest to them accrued descended remained fallen or come: (1) And that the said persons and their heirs,

(1) If a tenant in tail make a feoffment or bargain and sale, and the feoffee or bargainee levy a fine, the issue in tail have five years from the death of the tenant in tail, as no claim could be made by tenant in tad in his life time; but if the tenant in tail is disseised, the time begins to run immediately from the' fine being levied; and the time having run against the ancestor, continues against the iasue in tail, 3 Ren. 87.

is ordained by the authority aforesaid, that all such persons as be covert

Saving to every person or persons not party nor privy to the said fine their exception to avoid the same fine, by that, that those which were parties to the fine, nor any of them, nor no person or persons to their use, ne to the use of any of them, had nothing in the lands and tenements comprised in the said fine at the time of the said fine

of tenant for life divests the remainder and turns it to a right which is not devisable. Goodright v. Forrester, 8 East, 552, affirmed in the Exchequer Chamber on a different ground, mentioned infra.]

Raym. 219; —and see Fermor’s case, 3 Rep. 77. 2 And. 176. Saun-den v. Lord Annesley, 2 Scholes and Lefroy, 99. But if it be not a new right, but only the same right which accrues a second time, the saving does not apply, as if tenant in tail make a lease which is void and levy a fine, and the person entitled in remainder do not enter within five yean after the death of the ancestor, he has not. a new five yean after the eipiration of the lease. Sal-vin r. Clerk, Cro.Car. 156. W. Jones, 211. The cognisee of a second statute has five yean from the time of satisfaction of the first being entered on the record. Deighton r. Grenville, 2 Ventr. 333. 1 Sho. 36. Skinn. 260.

The statute does not bar bishops recton or persons entitled to lands in respect of offices for life; but each particular person is bound by a lapse of five yean in his own time. Plowd. 538.

Iu the case of Goodright v. Forrester, in the Exchequer Chamber, above referred to, 1 Taunt. 578. it was held, that if A, being tenant for life, with .remainder to his opm executors for forty yean, levy a fineand afterwards B, being entitled to the reversion in fee, devises to C for life with remainder to D, and C does not enter within five yean from the expiration of the term of forty yean, D has not five yean from the death of C, (supposing the reversion devisable after the fine) for that -as B or his heirs could not claim after the fire yean, he could not prolong the time by the limitations of his will. It was held by the Court, that the Plaintiff s tide was that of the same estate which B had at the time of the fine levied, and which first accrued before the fine, and that the Plaintiff could not bring himself within the saving as the title did not first accrue to him after the fine as a distinct original title by matter before the fine.

(2) It is established in the case of Howell v. Lord Zouch, Plowden 355, and confirmed in Doe on the demise of Durome r. Jones, 4 T. R. 300, and several intermediate cases, that on every statute of limitation, if a disability be once removed, the time must continue to run notwithstanding any subsequent disability; and in the last mentioned case this was ruled to be the law whethei the disability be voluntary or involuntary.

[No. VIII.] 32 Henry VIII. c. 36.—For the Exposition of the Statute of Fines.

* FORASMUCH as in the fourth year of file reign of the late King of famous memory, King Henry the Seventh, Father of our most dread Sovereign Lord the King that now is, it was among many good c and sundry statutes and ordinances then made for the common wealth, c enacted ordained and established the form and manner how fines should be levied with proclamations in the King’s court before his justices of his common place, and that such fines with proclamations so had and

made, to the intent to avoid all strife and debates, should be a final end,

* and conclude as well privies as strangers to the same, certain persons < excepted and saved, as in the same statute more plainly appeareth;

* sithen which time, by diversity of interpretations and expounding of the same statute, it hath been and is yet by some manner of persons doubted and called in question, whether fines with proclamations levied or to be

* levied before the said justices, by any person or persons having or 1 claiming to have in any manors lands tenements or hereditaments 1 comprised in the same fine, in possession reversion remainder or in use

* any manner of estate-tail, should immediately after the said fine levied

* engrossed and proclamation made, bind the right heir and heirs of such tenant in tail, and every other person and persons seised or chinwag to their use or uses; by occasion whereof divers .debates controversies suits and troubles have been begun moved and had within this realm,

and mo be like to ensue if remedy for the same be not provided; ’ For the establishment and reformation whereof, and for the sure and sincere interpretation of the said statute in avoiding all dangers contentions controversies ambiguities and doubts that hereafter may en surge grow or happen, our said Sovereign Lord the King, with the assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, hath enacted, and ordained. That all and singular fines as well heretofore levied as hereafter to be levied before the said justices with proclamations, according to the said statute, by any person or persons of full age of one and twenty years, of any manors lands tenements or hereditaments before the tune of the said fine levied in any wise entailed to the person or persons so levyh^ the same fine, or to any the ancestor or ancestors of the same person or

and discharge for ever against the said person and persons and their

parcel thereof, only by force of any such entail, and against all other

persons claiming the same or any parcel thereof, only to their use or ✓to

the use of any manner of heir of the bodies of them; any ambiguity

doubt or contrariosity of opinion, risen or .grown upon the said estatute

to the contrary notwithstanding. (1)

II. Provided alway, That this Act nor any thing therein contained ^ne kvied shall extend to bar or exclude the lawful entry tide or interest of any b7 , e, *

heir or heirs person or persons, heretofore given or hereafter to be given grown or accrued to them or any of them, in or to any manors lands tenements and hereditaments, by reason of any fine or fines heretofore yoi^ levied or hereafter to be levied by any woman after the death of her hus- u h. 7. c. 20-band, contrary to the form intent and effect of the statute made in the said eleventh year of the said King Henry the Seventh, of any manors lands tenements and hereditaments, of the inheritance or purchase of the said husband or of any his ancestors, given or assigned to any such woman in dower for term of life, or in tail in use or in possession, but that the same Act made in the said eleventh year of the] said late King Henry the Seventh shall stand remain and be in full strength and virtue in every article sentence and clause therein contained, in like manner and form as though this present Act had never been had ne made.

III. Provided also, That this Act ne any thing therein contained do A p*me levi#d extend to any fine or fines, at any time heretofore levied or hereafter to which

be levied, of any lordships manors lands tenements or other heredita- u restrained by

Parliament shall be void. Keilw. 210.

1) By virtue of this enactment and the preceding statute, 4 Henry VII. the fine of a party who is entitled to the premises as tenant in tail, ban the right of all who must necessarily convey their descent through the cognizor before they can make out their title to the estate -and the fine of tenant in tail in remainder, is equally a bar to the issue in tail, as' the fine of a tenant in tail in possession. So the possibility of an estate tail in the ancestor is sufficient to bar the issue, as where the issue in tail levied s fine in the life of his ancestor. See Archer’s case, 3 Rep. 90. The fine of a party who is heir in tail in possession, bars the collateral heirs claiming under the same descent, and who must necessarily claim through the cognizor, as if lands be given to die father and the heirs of his body, and the eldest son after the death of the father levies a fine, it is. a bar to the younger; hut a fine levied by the daughter being issue in tail, is no bar to a son afterwards bom; nor will a fine levied by issue in tail who dies in the life of the ancestor be a bar to the collateral issue. (Me. Williams* case. Hob. 332. . C. Sir Wm. Jones, by the name of Godfrey tu Wade.) See the above points more folly stated, with the authorities, in Mr. Cruise's Treatise on Fines, ch. 9.

Although a fine is not, like a recovery, a bar to the parties in remainder or reversion; yet if the party in remainder be collateral heir to die tenant in tail in possession levying the fine, he is bound by the warranty, which is always contained in the fine as the statute 4 & 5 Anne, c. 16. (ante Cfcaa L No. 23.) only makes void warranties by tenants for life, and collateral warranties by any

ancestor not having an estate of inheritance in possession.—See Cruise on Fines, ch. 9. $ 43.

The issue in tail are barred by a fine with proclamations, although the proclamations are not completed in the life of the cognizor, or at the time of bringing the fbnnedon by the issue. See

3 Rep. 84—90.

There is a material difference between the effect of a fine and a recovery by tenant in tail, with a reversion or remainder in fee to himself; for if a tenant in tail with reversion in fee to himself levy a. fine, the effect of that is to create a base fee, and that becomes merged in the other fee, and lets in all the incumbrances of the ancestor, which has frequently happened in practice from a person being ill advised to levy a fine instead of suffering a recovery. Per laird Kenyon, in Roe ex. detn. Crow v. Baldwere, 5 T. R. 109. Accordingly, in the Earl of Shelburne v. Biddulph,

4 Bro. P. C. 394. an estate was limited to the father for life, remainder to the sons successively in tail. Remainder to the father in fee. A, the first son, made a lease for three lives with covenant for perpetual renewal. A died without issue* and B, the second son, levied a fine, and the covenant was held to bind the fee.

So if tenant for life with remainder to his son in tail, and the reversion in fee in himself, be~ comes indebted by bond, or incumbers the estate in any other manner, if after the death of such tenant for life his son levies a fine, it will let m the reversion in foe, and make the estate HaUe to all his father's incumbrances.

VIII. Provided, That nothing in this Act contained shall be construed

to prejudice or affect any question of law which may arise upon common recoveries not remedied or intended to be remedied by this Act; but all such common recoveries shall remain and be of such force and effect as the same would have been if this Act had never been made, and of no other force or effect.

* and imparted to them generally by his many often and beneficial par• In adverting to the system of the law at present existing with respect to testamentary dispositions, 1 shall take the liberty of suggesting certain legislative alterations which I conceive would tend materially to its amelioration and improvement.

By the abolition of the feudal tenures, the restrictions which are the principal objects of this and the following statute have become inoperative; and the power of a disposition by will of freehold lands of inheritance is general and undefined.

It is agreed that copyhold landst are not within the Statute of Wills, and that they can only be the subject of devise through the medium of a surrender to the use of the will, or in consequence of those rules of courts of equity by which the want of a surrender is in certain cases supplied, and upon which it would be foreign to the present purpose to enlaxgd.—The power of devising copy-holds through the medium of a surrender, was originally wholly dependent upon special custom; hut in Pike v. White, 3 Bro. Ch. 286, it being alleged, that according to the custom of a manor, copyhold lands holden thereof, could not be surrendered to the use of the will of the tenant, and were not devisable by virtue of any custom subsisting in such manor. Lord Thurlow said, that it was totally impossible to say that a copyhold surrendered to the use of a will should not pass thereby; and therefore he must declare the custom, if there were such an one, bad.

This opinion is certainly very conducive to public convenience, with regard to its effects; jbjit it seems very difficult to support it upon the principle of mere legal reasoning; or to discover upon what correct principles a custom according with the general common law, and not affected by any legislative provision, could be controuled or superseded by mere judicial authority.

Certain customary estates are still not susceptible of devise, otherwise than by the medium of deeds of trust; and which in some instances must

t1 have thought it eligible to retain this part of the Note, notwithstanding the recent alteration of the law. See the last Number of this Class.

be renewed annually, or after certain periodical intervals, so that if the time of renewing them is suffered to elapse, or the testator falls into a state of incapacity, the devise becomes inoperative.

In Chftrch v. Mundav, 12 Ves. 426, and on Appeal, 15 Vesey, 396, the question arose, amongst others. Whether the reversion or remainder of a copyhold expectant on an estate tail, could be surrendered to the use of a will?—The Lord Chancellor directed inquiries; but after stating Lord Thuriow’s opinion above cited, said, the Court would hold that there might be a surrender to the use of the will, though no instance could be found upon the records of the manor; or if there could be no such custom, there must be some mode of disposition by deed, as in the case of customary freeholds, the want of which the Court would supply.

These cases shew the strong opinion of the courts, and which certainly are in accordance with the general feelings of mankind, in favour of extending the right of testamentary disposition; and it cannot be pretended that any real benefit results from the necessity of the circuitous course of a surrender or deed with respect to copyhold or customary estates, and the invalidity of wills, for want of those ceremonies, is a disappointment of the intention of a testator* upon which his general arrangements are founded. I conceive that much advantage, unaccompanied with any inconvenience, would result from a general provision that all lands and hereditaments, of whatever tenure, might: pass by devise, with proper regulations for preserving to the Lords the emoluments to which they are entitled in respect of the Acts, by which, according to the existing law, such dispositions are rendered valid.

The provisions of the Statute of. Frauds, 29 Car. II. c. 3. with respect to the attestation of wills of real estates, has been adverted to in commenting upon that statute in a former part of this collection, accompanied by some observations on the inconvenience of a certain mode of attestation being necessary in respect of certain descriptions of property, and not universally so; and in consequence of which the same general plan of disposition (up partially supported *

and partially defeated; whereas it must always be desirable that the same entire system of disposition should be either wholly valid or wholly void, which has frequently been the subject of judicial observation; and it certainly would be beneficial to apply one and the same rule of attestation to every subject of testamentary disposition, and to extend the present regulations to' the disposition of personal estates, and to the devise of copyholds when such devises are in other respects valid, and to the testamentary execution of powers.

One of the leading features of the present statute is that the testamentary power only attaches to lands belonging to the testator at the devise, •either by actual seisin or a vested right; and that no disposition can be made by will of freehold property to be afterwards acquired. Whether it might not be beneficial to give the same general right of testamentary disposition over future acquisitions of freehold property, which subsists 'with respect to personality, I do net think it material to inquire, as I apprehend that the balance of public convenience on either side would not be very considerable.

It was established previous to the Statute of •Wills, that a devise by a joint-tenant of lands devisable by custom was void; —and it is dear that a will by a joint-tenant who survives, or who afterwards severe the joint-tenancy, is of no effect. See Swift Roberts, 3 Bur. 1488. 1 Black. Rep. 476, and the statute 34 and 35 Henry VUI. But -a devise made by tenant in tail, after making tenant to the praecipe, and before suffering the recovery thereon, is good. Selwm v. Selwin,

1 Black. Rep. 222—251. 2 Bur. 1131.

And a possibility, by virtue of an executory •devise, or a springing use, is devisable. Roe v. Jones, 1 H. BL Rep. 30. 3 T. Rep. 88.

It is a general rule that a right of entry is not devisable, the authorities for which are fully expounded in the case of Goodright v. Forrester, *8 East, 552, in which it was held that the fine of tenant for life divested.the estate of tenant in fee «in remainder, and turned it to a right which was not devisable; and Lord EUenborough, after de-'livering the opinion of the Court to that effect, observed, that whatever mischief or hardship might attend the decision of the case, or might be expected to arise from the application of the name rule to other cases, it was an inconvenience which could, if their judgment was well founded, only be remedied by positive law; —and that the propriety of applying such a remedy, whereby the same rights of entry and action which belonged to 'the heir might be extended to the devisee, was m question particularly for the consideration of the 'legislature. Upon toe case coming before the Court of Exchequer Chamber upon writ of error.

1 Taunton, 578, it was decided upon the ground of non-claim, as to which see note to stat. 4 H. 7. c. 24. ante ClassX. No. 7. the Court declining to give any opinion upon the point decided in the Court of Ring's Benqh:as to which, Mansfield, Ch. J. observed, that since it would be unnecessary to decide on any of the points argued in the Court of King's Bench, it need not be inferred or supposed that the judgment of that Court was in any respept impeached by the decision: the Court would not at present give judgment upon those points, because it would first be necessary minutely to examine the old authorities, which, upon the present grounds of their decision, it would be superfluous to do. If the doctrine of estates arisingby disseisin was such as had been stated by the defendant’s counsel, they must lament that the law was such. Our ancestors got into very odd notions on these subjects, and were induced by particular causes to make estates grow out of wrongful acts. The reason was the prodigious jealousy which the law always had of permitting rights to be transferred from one . man to another, lest the poorer should be harassed by rights being transferred to more'powerful persons. It is evident that the reasons of this principle of the law are not applicable to the present state of -society; and the opinions which have been ched aeem sufficient authority to shear that it might be .desirable to extend the power of devise to all interests which, without such devise, would be descendible to the heir; and «t any rate the interests of justice demand that the testamentary power of the person in remainder sfofald not be effected by the wrongful acts of the particular tenant.—See some observations upon this subject in the notes to the Statute of Uses 27 H. 8. ante Class IX. No. 3.

But perhaps there are few settled doctrines of law, to which 4t would be more desirable to apply the correction of legislative authority, than that by which a devise is rendered inoperative, in consequence of a subsequent conveyance of the estate, contrary to the admitted intentions of the testator.

It would be superfluous to enter into the detail of a subject which has, within a recent period, been so fully elucidated. The positions that* devise is annulled at law by a subsequent conveyance of the estate, although the testator by the effect of the Statute of Uses continues seised of the ancient estate, and even although the conveyance is inoperative for want of legal requisites, and that when there is a revocation at law a court of equity will not controul the legal operation of the conveyance, except in certain definite cases, are fully established as settled rules of property. The history of the ktw upon this subject, and the grounds and principles upon winch it is 2 G 2

It is very unnecessary to enter into the consideration of the technical principles upon which the law in this respect is founded, or to take part either with those who charge theleading cases with shocking absurdity, or with those who consider the doc-trineas necessarilyemanatingfrom the essential principles of the subject. The question for consideration as a matter of legislative interference is, whether . it would be more conducive to utility that the law should continue as it is, or that it should be reformed. The disappointment of the intention of the testator is an undisputed ingredient in the question; and the benefit, if such there is, from permitting it to continue, results from the contingent advantage derived by the heir, in consequence of the ignorance of his ancestor of s technical rule, the knowledge of which would immediately be followed by the necessary provisions for preventing such advantage from being obtained. Mr. Justice Rooke, in the original decision of Goodtitle and Otway, and Mr. Justice Ashurst upon the writ of error, seem to think that the hardship of the case is sufficiently disposed of, by holding that if individuals will be se negligent as not to apply to those who have the reputation of being the best versed in the science of the law, they are themselves the most to blame; and Lord Kenyon, in a style of general declamation which would apply to any alteration of the law upon any subject, observes, that those who'are confident of their superior abilities may perhaps fancy that they could erect a new system of laws less objectionable than that under which they live, .but he had not that confidence in his, and was satisfied by the decisions and series of decisions of great and learned men on the rules of law, under which the landed property of this country is now held. If the observation is intended to apply only to the exercise of judicial authority, it is certainly not otherwise exceptionable than as is a mere solemn declaration of what no person conversant with the subject would ever think of bringing into dispute; but if understood as importing that u the law is so and therefore it ought to be so, ” it involves a principle which if it had always been acted upon, and formed an essential part of the wisdom of our ancestors, would .have superseded the discussion of the question by preventing altogether the innovation the common law, which took place by the nment of tho Statute of Wills.

>rd Kenyon in deciding, as he was bound to

do, in favour of the invalidity of the will, which was the subject of the case of Goodtitle ©. Otway, observed, that if he could have indulged ha wishes, he could have wished to give effect to the intention of the testator. Lord Eldon, speaking in Harmood r. Oglander of a consultation with Serjeant Hill respecting the same will, said that he was desirous, as every roan must be, to support that will as not revoked. Lord Chief Justice Eyre, whose opinion in one part of the case was different from that of the other Judges, prefaced the delivery of it by observing, that though the doctrine of revocation had been carried to a very inconvenient extent, in consequence of the many wills that had been cruelly disappointed and many families greatly distressed, agreed that Judges were not to be wiser than the law—and that it was their duty to declare and execute the law as it is, and to strain nothing in order to mould it to their own conception of what it ought to be. In the course of his judgment he observed, that courts of justice not only do not incline to allow the form of conveyance to operate beyond the intent of the parties, but they will be ready to adopt all manner of expedients to prevent it, and to confine the operation of every conveyance to the special purpose for which it was made. In another part, referring to one of the earlier cases, he saM that the Court of Exchequer carried the odious doctrine of revocation no further than they were absolutely obliged to do. Lord Mansfield constantly regretted the existence of the subsisting rules, while he subscribed to their authority. In Swift v. Roberts, 3 Bur. 1491, he said, that constructive revocations, contrary to the intention of the testator, ought not to be indulged—and that some overstrained resolutions of that sort had brought a scandal upon the law. In Roe v. Griffiths, 4 Bur. 1952, 1 BL 603, “The rule being, established must be adhered to, although it is not founded, upon truly rational grounds and principles, nor upon the intent, but upon legal niceties and subtlety; we ought not to depart from it now, notwithstanding one could wish that no such rule had ever been established, and lament that such subtleties should ever been admitted as the ground of it.” M All revocations, which are not agreeable to the intention of the testator, are founded on artificial and absurd reasoning.”—Doe v. Potts, Doug. 710. Lord Loughborough had a more favourable opinion of these decisions, as necessarily resulting from fair legs! —that is from fair systematical reasoning, and not depending upon captious nicety.—See Brydget «• Duchess of Chandos, 2 Ves. jun. 417.

With those sentiments which 1 entertain in favour of the propriety of a legislative correction of the existing system of the law, in cases where the practical applicaticf|(9^ i<(is attended with reel

convenience, I certainly should feel pleasure from the enactments, that ne devise of lands should be annulled or affected by any recovery fine or other conveyance of the land therein comprised, except so far as shall be necessary for the particular object or purpose for which such conveyance shall be made—but that every such devise shall be valid and effectual at law as to all such legal interest as after such conveyance shall remain in or result to the devisor—and that where the legal estate shall be transferred from such devisor, the devise shall be deemed valid and effectual in equity, as to al^ such beneficial right and interest as shall continue to belong to the devisor.

It remtins only to notice the cases to which the rule whereby a will is annulled by a subsequent alteration in the estate of the testator does not apply.

If (he disposition only embraces a particular interest in the estate, as in the case of a lease, the will is only affected to the extent of the interest conveyed.

The only instance at law in which a will remains valid after a disposition operating upon the entire estate, is that of a partition; with respect to which it is held, that although affected by fine the will continues in force. See Luther v, Kidby, 8 Vin. Abr. 148, 3 P. Wms. 169. Risby v. Bul-tinglass, T. Raym. 240. But if the Act extends further than mere partition, and contains a limitation to such uses as the devisor shall by deed or will appoint, the will is annulled. Tickner r. Tickner, cited 3 Atk, 742. In the discussion of the case of Goodtide v. Otway, in the Court of Common Pleas, some doubt was thrown upon the former of these decisions; and the latter was considered by some of the Judges as overturning it; —but it seems to be now agreed that the law is as stated, Attorney- General r. Vigor, 8 Ves. 281, and the observations of Lord Eldon in Maundrell v. Maundrell, 10 Ves. 246, where this distinction is relied upon as shewing the efficacy of a power of appointment by the person to whom in default of appointment the premises are limited in fee.

In the case of the Attorney-General v. Vigor, ubi supra, it was established that if lands after being devised are exchanged, and after the death of the devisor restored in consequence of the eviction of the lands taken in exchange, the devise is not thereby re-established.

In equity it is established that a mortgage or conveyance in trust for payment of debts, is only a revocation pro tanto f hut a trust for payment of debts, and after payment thereof to convey the estate to such uses as the devisor should by deed or will appoint, has been held to be a revocation. Kenyon v. Sutton, cited 2 Ves. jun. 600, and the exception does not extend to other dispositions for a particular purpose. In Harmood r. Oglander,

8 Ves. 125, Lord Eldon said that it did not occur to him there were in equity any cases where the partial particular purpose was-not for charges and

incumbrances, or which is the same thing to pay debts; and equity has said that which is a revocation at Aw shall not be a revocation in equity.

Where a devise is made by a person seised of or entitled to an equitable estate, it is not annulled in equity by a conveyance to him of the legal estate. Ibis is continually exemplified in the cases of wills made of estates for which the testator has entered into a contract of purchase, and which are subsequently conveyed. See Rose r. Cunnyngham, 11 Ves. 550. In Watts r. Fullarton, cited Doug. 691, it was held that the will was not revoked by the purchaser taking the conveyance to another person in trust for himself.

So the will of a person entitled to an equitable estate is not revoked by a conveyance of the legal estate from one trustee to another. Watts iv Fullarton, Doug. 718. nor the will of a person entitled, subject to a mortgage in fee, by a conveyance from the mortgagee to a trustee for the mortgagor. Doe t». Potts, Doug. 719. But in the recent case of Rawlins v. Bengis, 2 V. and B. 382, a person after devising land which he had contracted to purchase, took the conveyance with the usual limitations to bar dower, with the interposition of a trustee; and it was ruled by the Vice-Chancellor that the will was revoked.

In Williams v. Owen, 2 Ves. jun. 595, a testator having articled to settle his estate previous to marriage, devised the reversion subject to the estates intended to be created by the articles, and afterwards conveyed the estate to the uses and upon the trusts mentioned in the articles. Thin was ruled by Sir R. P. Arden, Master of the Rolls, to be no revocation; arjd coni pared to the case of a person having an equitable estate taking a conveyance of the legal estate; but the decision is considered as inconsistent with the rules established in subsequent cases, especially in Cave v. Holford. See 3 Ves. 684, and Harmood and Oglander, ubi supra, Cave u. Holford, 3 Ves. 682.

7 Bro. P. C. 593. The groynd of the Lord Chancellor’s dissent (as stated in Harmood v. Oglander) from the decisions in Williams v. Owen is, that the testator never had any equitable estate in the reversion in fee: u You cannot have a legal estate in trust for yourself. There is a conjunction of the legal and equitable interests, and therefore it was a legal oetate that passed jinder that will.”

As to whether a deed set aside in equity fo£ fraud is a revocation of a preceding will, see Beard v. Beard, 3 Atk. 72. Hawes v. Wyatt,

3 Bra Ch. 156, and observations thereon, in 7 Vesey, 373. expane the Earl of Ilchester’s case, and in the Attorney-General v. Vigor, 8 Ves. 283. And see Roberts on Wills, c. 2. sec. 6.

(1) The provision being confined to an action of debt, an action of covenant does not lie thereon.—Wilson v. Knubley, 7 East, 127,

(2) A suit in equity, founded upon the statute, must also be against the heir and devisee jointly.

- —Warren v. Stawell, 2 Atk. 125.

(4) In a case within the statute, the devisee must shew by plea the particular lands devised.— Gott v. Atkins, in Willes, 523.

(5) But in the arrangement of the funds in equity between the heir and devisee, it is established that assets descended to the heir must be applied to pay debts before lands can be charged which are specifically devised.—Chaplin v. Chaplin, 3 P. Wms. 367—Powis v. Corbet, 3 Atk. 556. As to the order of liability between different funds, see Harmood v. Oglander, 8 Veiey, 124— Idilnes v. Slater, ibid. 295.

(6) In Gott v. Atkinson, Willes, 521, it was ruled, that no action can be maintained upon this statute against devises in trust to sell and apply the money arising by such sale in payment of debts—and by Wills, Ch. J. as the exception is worded, if there had been a devise for the payment of any particular debt by simple contract, it would have been a good devise against the plain. lift though bond, creditors. In the recent case of Millar v. Horton, 1 Cowp. Ch. 45, it was jruledf that a devise to pay simple contract credi-. ton, in preference to specialty, was good within the statute. In Vernon v. Vawdry, Bam. 304, cited ibid, it had been held that a devise to pay debts, excepting a debt as surety, was not within the proviso—but that case seems repugnant both to the express letter of the Act, and the other authorities upon the subject. In Lingard v. Lord Derby, 1 Bro. Ch. 311, the testator devised to irosteea in trust to pay the yearly rents and profits in payment of his debts. Upon spplication by

bond creditors for a sale, it was insisted that the will could not stand by the statute, for a bond creditor without the devise may compel a sale, and the devise tends to defeat his claim—Aut by Lord Loughborough, L. C. both by the wank and construction of the statute, where there is. a tie-vise for the payment of debts it takes the case out of the statute, and it stands as it wwkLhafre done before the statute' waa made—the .creditor can come only as the will directs. See to the same effect the Earl of Bath v. the Earl of Bradford, 2 Ves. 577. In Hughes v. Doulben, 2 Bro. Ch. 614, the testator made a general charge of his debts upon his real estate, and devised a particular estate to trustees for that purpose, oscmting the mansion-house. Lord Thurlow said that he was not aware that a gift for the payment of debts, in a manner which would not answer the purpose, was such a devise as would take the case out of the statute; that if the debts could not be paid by the means provided in the devise, he should order the estate to be sold, notwithstanding the statute, and should consider it so for as fraudulent — and if the estate without the mansion-house was not sufficient, the mansion-house must be sold. In Bailey v. Ekins, 7 Ve-sey, 323, Lord Eldon said that the uniform mle is, that a provision by will effectual in law .or equity for payment of creditors, is not-fraudulent within the intent of the statute.—See Sidney v, Coussmaker, 12 Vesey, 154. Where an estate is devised generally for payment of debts, it is a settled rule that simple contract creditors are intitled equally with creditors by specialty—and that if the specialty creditors have exhausted die personal estate, they can have no benefit from the real estate constituting equitable assets, until the simple contract creditors are placed pari passu— and in the above-mentioned case of Bailey and Ekins, and the authorities there cited, it was held that a charge upon an estate as well as a devise makes it equitable assets.

OTIEREAS by the customs of certain manors, copyhold estates of such 55 G. IIL manors pass by the last will and testament of the copyhold tenants c. 192.

* A friend, to whom I had some time ago communicated my ideas upon the subjects mentioned in the preliminary note to the present title, applied to me to draw the present Act on behalf of the gentleman who had agreed to bring it forward. I wished the opportunity not to be lost of submith| tot he attention of the legislature the other

modifications of the law referred to in the above-mentioned note, but it was not thought expedient to include them in the intended Bill.

According to the draft which I submitted, the provision would have been general, as embrad* all copyhold and customary estates, with ref to such interests as a testator could by any

thereof declaring the uses of surrenders made for that puspose: And whereas much inconvenience has arisen from the necessity of making such surrenders: For remedy whereof, May k please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the Kings most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That in all cases where by the custom of any manor in England or Ireland any copyhold tenant of such manor may by his or her last will and testament dispose of or appoint his or her copyhold tenements, the same having been surrendered to such uses as should be declared by such last wul and testament, every disposition or charge made or to be made by any such last will and testament by any person who shall die after the passing of this Act, of any such copyhold tenements, or of any right title or interest in or to the same, shall be as valid and effectual to all intents and purposes, although no surrender shall have been made to the use of the last will and testament of such person, as die same would have been if a surrender had been made to the use of such will:

II. Provided also and it is hereby further enacted, That no person entitled or claiming to be entitled to copyhold lands tenements or hereditaments, in consequence of any testamentary disposition, shall be entitled to be admitted to the same by virtue of any thing in this Act contained, except upon payment of all such stamp duties fees and sums of money as would have been lawfully due and payable in respect of the surrendering of such copyhold lands tenements or hereditaments to the use of such will, or in respect of the presenting registering or inrolling such surrender, bad the same lands tenements ana hereditaments been surrendered to the use of the wjtf of the person so disposing of the same; all such stamp duties fees or sums of money due as aforesaid to be paid in addition to the stamp dudes fees or sums of money due or payable on the admission of such person so entitled or claiming to be entitled to the same copyhold lands tenements or hereditaments and the stamp duties to be affixed to the copy of the admission.

III. Provided always and it is hereby enacted and declared. That

nothing in this Act contained shall be construed deemed or taken at law or in equity to render invalid or ineffectual any devise or disposition of any copyhold lands tenements or hereditaments, or of any right title or interest in or to copyhold lands tenements or hereditaments, which would be valid or effectual if this Act had not been made; or to render valid andL effectual any devise or disposition of any copyhold lands tenements or hereditaments, or of any right title or interest in or to any copyhold lands tenements or hereditaments, which would be invalid or ineffectual if a Surrender bad been made to the use of the last will and testament of the person attempting to dispose of the same by will; any thing herein before, contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

of conveyance have disposed of; and I wished the testamentary power to have been subject to the general provisions of the Statute of Frauds, as one step towards that general uniformity in the mode of testamentary disposition, which I conceive would be attended with very important benefit to tile public.

It certainly would never have occurred to me, upon perusing the purview of the Act, to bars contemplated the necessity of the concluding proviso, or the possibility of any doubts being entertained of the nature of those which the proviso is calculated to obviate.

The statutes 8 & 18 H. 6. ante, afforded a very salutary protection against an evident in attachment of the Crown upon the rights of the subject, for the sake of gratifying particular favourites; but as the prerogative is now invariably exercised in support of the beneficial interests which weuld exist, as between subject and subject, there is no longer a

necessity for restricting the exercise of that prerogative by a continuance of the regulations intended as a guard against mischiefs which can no longer be apprehended, and the compliance with which regulations is attended with a very heavy and often a very inconvenient expence. 1 apprehend that no objection could reasonably be mado to an enactment enabling the Crown to maker such grants upon the report of the Attorney and Solicitor-General, or of a proper officer of tho Exchequer and other courts of revenue; saving to all persons such rights at law or in equity as they would have had against the hahfe of the person^ upon whose rtcmec the has taken pleosU

THE COMPILER.

ADVERTISEMENT.

This Publication was undertaken by the Compiler for the purpose of placing within the reach of his Townsmen, a complete Collection of the Acts of Parliament relating to Hull; the want of such a Work has been generally felt and acknowledged, as many of the more ancient Statutes, from lapse of time and other circumstances, have become extremely scarce. The Acts relating to Sculcoates have been added, as that parish may now be considered associated in interest as well as proximity with the town of Hull. He believes that no Act at all affecting either jurisdiction has escaped his attention.

The Acts for lighting, cleansing, and improving the town of Hull having been passed as circumstances rendered necessary, and the later, without expressly repealing the more early Acts, while many of their provisions were materially varied or annulled, have at length grown into a complicated mass, difficult to be understood or administered; the Compiler has endeavoured to lessen this difficulty by a series of notes and references, pointing out how each clause has been altered, repealed, confirmed, or otherwise affected by subsequent enactments. If he has in any degree contributed to render them more easy of application, his labour will not have been in vain.

The various Statutes have been digested under general heads, by which means all the laws relating to each subject are presented at one view. A Table of Contents refers to each of these heads, a Chronological Table, which he has endeavoured to render as accurate as possible, exhibits the order of time in which the Statutes were respectively passed; and, to increase the facility of reference, a copious Index is subjoined.

III. And whereas an act was passed in the fifteenth year of the reign of King George the Second, intituled, " An Act for explaining, amending and

more effectual two Acts of Parliament, one passed in the ninth and tenth years of the reign of his late majesty King William the Third, for erecting Workhouses and Houses of Correction in the town of Kingston-upon-Hull, for the employment and maintenance of the poor there; and the other passed in the eighth year of the reign of her late majesty Queen Anne, for the more effectual provision of the poor in the said town whereby amongst other things, the said corporation were empowered, in such manner, and by such ways and means, as by the said recited act of the ninth and tenth years of King William the Third, was prescribed for the raising the assessments thereby intended to be raised, from time to time to certify and assess such sum or sums of money as should be necessary for the maintenance of the poor of the said town within or under the care of the aid corporation, so as that the same should not in any one year exceed the sum of six hundred and fifty pounds.

IV. And whereas an act was passed in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of King George the Second, intituled, " An Act for explaining amending and making more effectual several Acts of Parliament relating to the maintenance and employment of the poor of the town of Kingston-upon-Hull, and for better paving, preserving and cleansing the streets, squares, lanes and alleys, in the said town, and preventing obstructions therein, and for preserving the lamps which shall be set up to enlighten the streets of the said town, and securing the property of such lamps to the owners whereby, amongst other things, after reciting the said three former act.*, and setting forth that by reason of the continual increase of the poor in the

Recite* that the mode in which the Poor Rate* had been ascertained had ere. ated an unequal chargr and that other powers and provisions were necessary.

That the Town

consists of Two Parishes and Six Wards, one of which is divided into two parts, and that My ton has of late years been considered a "Ward.

That Overseers have been appointed to the said Wards and the said Precinct of My ton, notwithstanding' Doubts as to the Legality of such appointment.

That it would tend to facilitate the Collection of the Poor's Rates if Myton was divided into two Wards, and if Trinity Ward was constituted One Ward only.

said town, under the care of the said corporation, the sum of six hundred and fifty pounds in the last recited of such acts mentioned, together with the revenues and other income of the said corporation, were not sufficient to maintain the said poor, or to discharge the large debts contracted by the said corporation (part of which debts were contracted in building or repairing the workhouse in the said town,) the said corporation were and are empowered in any of their courts or assemblies from time to time, to set down, ascertain and certify, unto the mayor, recorder and aldermen of the said town, what weekly, monthly, or other sum or sums of money should be necessary for the maintenance of such poor, so as such sum or sums did not, in any one year, exceed in the whole the sura of one thousand pounds, except it should happen that the sum of one thousand pounds should in some years not be sufficient for maintaining and setting to work such poor, in which case, as often as any such deficiency should be foreseen or apprehended, the said corporation were and are empowered in any of their courts or assemblies to be called and held in the manner therein prescribed, to certify to the mayor, recorder and aldermen of the said town, what weekly, monthly, or other sum or sums of money would be necessary for such purposes in the next ensuing year, although amounting in the whole to more than the said sum of one thousand pounds; and the said mayor and aldermen were and are thereupon empowered to proportion, assess, raise and levy, or cause to he assessed, raised and levied, the sum or sums of money so certified, or so much thereof as they should judge necessary, although amounting in the whole to more than the sum of one thousand pounds.

V. And whereas the mode in which the poor rates in the said town of Kingston-upon-Hull have, by virtue of the powers and provisions of the said recited acts, hitherto been ascertained, certified, apportioned and assessed, hath been found to create an unequal charge upon the persons and property rated, and to be otherwise inexpedient, and the powers and provisions of the said recited acts for assessing and collecting such rates, have been found defective and insufficient, and it would tend to facilitate the execution of the purposes of the said recited acts, if other powers and provisions were granted and made in lieu thereof, and whereby the said rates may be equalized, and the better collection thereof effected.

VI. And whereas the said town of Kingston-upon-Hull consists of two parishes, videlicet, the parish of the Holy Trinity, and the parish of Saint Mary; which said two parishes are at present and have been for time out of mind, divided into six wards, called Austin Ward, Humber Ward, Trinity Ward, Saint Mary's Ward, Whitefriar Ward, and North Ward; and the ward called Trinity Ward, (one of the said six wards) has for a number of years past been divided into two parts, called first part Trinity Ward, and second part Trinity Ward; and besides the said six wards, the lordship or precinct of Myton, adjoining to and belonging to the said town, and which is within the said parish of the Holy Trinity, has of late years been considered as a ward or division of the said town, for the purpose of raising its proportion of the poor's rate, and overseers have been appointed to it, who have collected the proportion of the general rate laid upon it.

VII. And whereas overseers of the poor have hitherto been appointed to the said several wards of the said town, and the said precinct of Myton, adjoining and belonging thereto; (that is to say,) one overseer to each ward, and two overseers to the said precinct, and questions have frequently arisen as to the legality of such appointment, (there being no particular clause or power contained in any of the said recited acts for the appointment of overseers to the said wards and precinct instead of the parishes of the said town, though by some, or one of the said recited acts, overseers of the wards are expressly mentioned and recognized.

VIII. And whereas it would tend to facilitate the collection of the poor's rates, and the execution of the purposes of the said recited acts, and prevent much litigation and expence, if the lordship or precinct of Myton, adjoining and belonging to the said town, were to be divided into two parts or divisions, and if each of such parts or divisions were declared to be a ward of the said town, and if an equal number of guardians of the poor were to be elected and appointed for each of such new wards; and also, if express power and provision were made for the appointment of one overseer of the

37

Class I.] Poor of Hull.

poor, as well for each of the before mentioned six wards as for each of such new wards; and it would also tend to facilitate the purposes aforesaid, if the present division of Trinity Ward were to be abandoned, and if what are now called and considered the first and second parts of Trinity Ward, in the said town, were constituted into one ward only.

IX. And whereas it is expedient that the mayor, recorder and aldermen of the said town for toe time being, individually, as well as in their official capacity, should in future be exonerated from the offices of guardians of the poor of the said town, and that other guardians of the poor should be elected in addition to the number of guardians heretofore elected under the powers and provisions of the said recited acts.

X. And whereas the number of the poor in the said town of Kingston-upon-Hull, under the care of the said corporation, has of late years greatly increased, and the present workhouse in the said town is too small for the reception, classification, management and accommodation of such poor, and it is expedient that the corporation of the poor of the said town should he authorized to enlarge the said workhouse, and any of the buildings thereto belonging, or to take down the same, and in lieu thereof to provide, erect or build on the same site, or to purchase ground in any other part of the said town or lordship of Myton, and to erect or build thereon a more commodious work-house, with proper and suitable offices and conveniences for the maintaining, lodging, employment and accommodation of the poor, and for the use of the corporation of the poor of the said town; and also that the said corporation should be empowered to sell the present workhouse and other buildings, and the site or sites thereof, and the ground thereunto belonging, and also any other messuages, buildings, lands, tenements or hereditaments belonging to the corporation of the poor of the said town, or which have heretofore been purchased by the said corporation out of money raised for the relief of the poor under their care and management, or the rents and profits whereof have been hitherto applied towards the relief and maintenance of such poor, and to apply the monies arising from such sale or sales in or towards defraying the expences of such new works, and also to raise money towards such expences, and for other purposes towards the better regulation and general relief of the poor of the said town.

XI. And whereas it hath been found extremely burthensome and inconvenient to the overseers of the poor of the respective wards and precinct of the said town of Kingston-upon-Hull, to collect, receive and pay over the several rates and assessments raised and levied therein; and it is therefore expedient that the said overseers should be assisted in the collection thereof, and that proper and efficient persons should be appointed assistant overseen for the collection of the said rates, and that more effectual powers and provisions should be granted and made for assessing and collecting the said rates.

XII. And whereas the powera and provisions of the said recited acts, for the employment, accommodation, maintenance and regulation of the poor, have been found inadequate for the purposes thereby intended, and it is expedient that the same should be altered, amended and enlarged; and it would tend greatly to facilitate the execution of the purposes aforesaid if the said first three recited acts, and so much of the said last recited act as relates to the maintenance and employment of the poor were repealed, and if farther and other powers and provisions were granted and made for those purposes.

XIII. May it therefore please your Majesty, that it may be enacted: and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same. That from and after the thirtieth day of September next, the said recited acts of the ninth and tenth year of the reign of King William the Third, the eighth year of the reign of Queen Anne, and the fifteenth year of the reign of King George the Second, and also so much of the said recited act of the twenty-eighth year of the reign of King George the Second, as is for explaining, amending and making more effectual several acts of parliament, relating to the maintenance and employment of the poor of the town of Kingston-upon-Hull, shall be, and the same are and is hereby declared to be repealed.

XIV. And be it further enacted, That from and after the said thirtieth day of September next, the present division of Trinity Ward shall, for the

town of Kingston-upon-Hull; and for better paving, preserving and cleansing the streets, squares, lanes, and alleys in the said town, and preventing obstructions therein; and for preserving the lamps which shall be set up to enlighten the streets of the said town, and securing the property of such lamps to the owners it was amongst other things enacted, That from and after the first day of May, 1755, if the occupier of any house or houses, lands or tenements, within the said town and liberties thereof, therein called Trippet, should refuse or neglect to clean so much of the streets, squares, lanes or alleys, within the said town and liberties, as did or should lie contiguous to, fronting, and between his or her said house or houses, lands or tenements respectively, and the middle of any of the said streets, squares, lanes or alleys; or to carry off the filth, dirt and soil thereof, for the space of two days next after public notice should be given, by order of the mayor of the said town, by the public bellman thereof, for the inhabitants or occupiers of houses, lands or tenements within the said town, to make clean the streets, squares, lanes and alleys then made, or thereafter to be made, before their respective houses, lands and tenements; then, and in every such case, it should be lawful for any person or persons, to be for that purpose appointed by the justices of peace of and for the said town and county of the same town, at any of their quarter sessions to be held for the said town and county thereof, to clean and carry off the filth, dirt and soil, from so much of every of the said streets, squares, lanes, or alleys, as every such occupiers should refuse or neglect to make clean, or carry of the filth, dirt, and soil from as aforesaid: and if any such occupier should refuse, after demand made, to satisfy such person or persons to be appointed as aforesaid, for his or their trouble and charge in cleaning and carrying off the dirt, filth and soil fromsueh part or parts of any of the said streets, squares, lanes or alleys, as such occupier should have neglected to clean or carry the dirt from as aforesaid; then such person or persons so to be appointed as aforesaid, should and might, by warrant under the band and seal of the mayor of the said town for the time being, or under the hands and seals of any two justices of the peace of and for the said town and county of the same, levy by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of every such offender, such sum or sums of money as the said mayor or the said two justices should assess and direct in such warrant to be paid to such person or persons for his or their trouble as aforesaid.

II. And whereas, in and by another part of the said recited act, provision was made for preserving the lamps, and the posts, irons, and other furniture thereof, then proposed to be set up and maintained by many of the principal inhabitants of the said town, for enlightening the streets, squares, lanes and alleys thereof; but no provision being made in the said act for setting up, maintaining, and lighting any lamps in the said town at the public expence, the method then proposed of enlightening the said town at the private expence of particular inhabitants therein hath proved ineffectual, and the means prescribed by the above mentioned act for cleaning the streets, squares, lanes and alleys in the said town, have proved inconvenient, and also ineffectual for the purposes intended, by reason of the number of empty houses therein; and it is deemed necessary that one or more assessment or assessments should be laid on the occupiers of houses, lands and tenements in the said town, for defraying the expences of one or more public scavenger or scavengers, to be appointed for cleaning the said streets, squares, lanes and alleys; and of some proper person or persons to be appointed for setting up, maintaining and lighting, in the night time, a sufficient number of lamps therein, in such places as shall be thought necessary and proper.

WHEREAS by an act of parliament passed in the second y<\irofflu* Pre*mMp. reign of his present Majesty King George the Third, intituled, "An Act to "arneud and render more effectual several acts made for cleansing and " enlightening the streets of the town of Kingston-upon-Hull, and for pre- venting annoyances therein," it was (amongst other tilings) enacted. That the mayor and aldermen of the said town of Kingston-upon-Hull for the. Redial of 2nd time being, or the major part of them, within one month next after the Geo. 111. c. 7u. twenty-fourth day of June in every year should, by writing under their bands, nominate and appoint one or more inhabitant or inhabitants within the said town to make and settle, and such persons so to be nominated were thereby required, within two months next after notice of such nomination, to make or settle one or more rate or rates, assessment or assessments, according to a pound rate, upon the several inhabitants and occupiers of houses and tenements within ttie said town and liberties thereof, of the yearly reut or value of three pounds and upwards, for rafting such sum and sums of money as the said mayor and aldermen should think necessary, and by such writing direct, not exceeding, in ary one year, eightpence in the pound, according to such valuation as the said houses or tenement* were or should be in the same jear, or last were assessed to the public land tax. to be allowed and confirmed, collected, levied, and raised by such per* son and persons, and in such manner, and with and under such penalties and provisoes as in the said act are directed, expressed, and contained: and ,

II. And whereas since the passing of the said act, the mayor and alder*

men of the said town of Kingston-upon-Hull have caused a calculation to be taken and made of the charges and expences of sweeping, cleansing, and keeping clean and enlightening the streets, lanes, squares and alleys in the said town and liberties thereof, according to the direction and intent of tha said act, and of the amount of the sums of money which can be yearly raised by or upon such rates and assessments as they are thereby empowered to order to be made, levied, and collected, and have found that the same will be greatly deficient to answer the purposes aforesaid, by reason that many houses and tenements in the said town, of considerable yearly rent or value, are belonging to the hospital of the Trinity House in the said town, or appropriated to other charitable uses, and have never been assemed to the land tax, and that many other houses and tenements in the said town, of the yearly rent or value of three pounds and upwards apiece, lately built by or belonging to some one owner, and by him or her let to several tenants, have never been separately assessed to the land tax, but such owner hath always been assessed and paid the land tax for all his said houses together, so that the several tenants or occupiers of such houses, and of the houses and tenements belonging to the said hospital, and appro* priated to charitable uses as aforesaid, cannot be assessed for the same as by the said act is directed, although they will have equal benefit with the other inhabitants of the said town of the cleansing and enlightening the streets thereof; and further, by reason that the inhabitants of the houses in the market-place in the said town, which are numerous, and of very considerable yearly rents or value, are exempted by a proviso in the said act hereinafter mentioned and recited from being assessed towards the deans* ing the streets thereof.

III. And whereas for the reasons aforesaid, and by reason of the doubts and objections that have arisen and oeeu made by the occupiers of meadow and pasture ground lying within the liberties of the said town of Kingston* upon-Hull, and not adjoining to or occupied with any dwelling-house, touching and against their being chargeable with the said rates as they seem to be by the words of the said act, it is become necessary to make some alteration in the rates and assessments directed by the said act, and manner of laying the same, and to apply the money to arise therefrom to the purpose of sweeping, cleansing, and enlightening the streets, squares, lanes and alleys within the walls and gates of the said town of Kingston-upon-Hull only.

IV. May it therefore please your Majesty, That it may be enacted; and be it enacted, by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, m this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That instead of the rates and assessments directed by the said act to be made, levied, and raised for the purposes therein mentioned, there shall be, from and after the first day of August one thousand seven hundred and sixty-four, annually raised within the said town of Kingston-upon-Hull, by assessments as hereinafter mentioned, such sum and sums of money as shall be sufficient for the purposes of lighting, sweeping and cleansing the streets, squares, lanes and alleys within the walls and gates of the said town of Kingston-upon-Hull, at, from, and during such times and in such manner as hereinafter is mentioned and directed, so as the money to be raised in any one year for the purposes aforesaid shall not exceed the sum of eight-pence in the pound of the yearly rent or value of the houses, grounds and tenements to be charged with such assessments as hereinafter is expressed.

V. And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, That the re* spective churchwardens for the time being of the several parish-churches of the Holy Trinity and Saint Mary in the said town of Kingston-upon-Hull, shall and they are hereby required on the Sunday next after the first day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and sixty-four, and in every succeeding year, to give or cause to be given public notice in their said respective parish churches immediately after morning or evening service, for the several owners or occupiers of mes* uages, lands or tenements situate and being within the walls and gates of the said town, of the yearly rent or value of three pounds or upwards, to assemble and meet together on the Thursday next following every suck

III.

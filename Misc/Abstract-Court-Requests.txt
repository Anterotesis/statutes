By Rex v. The Commissioners of the Court of Requests in the city of London, 7 East, 292, it seems, that a stock-broker is liable to pay to the Chamberlain of London, for the benefit of the corporation, the annual doty of 40s., directed by stat. 6 Ann. c. 16. § 4. to be received by the chamberlain from every broker. But at all events, if the chamberlain sue for such doty in the Court of Requests and that court dedioetakingcog-nizance of the suit, on the ground that the corporation,for whose benefit the duty was to be received, had taken a bond in the penal sum of 10/.

(the court having jurisdiction only to the extent of 5/.) from the broker, upon which lie might be sued in the superior courts, and that the judges of the Court of Requests were freemen of the corporation interested in the suit, the superior court will grant a ma to the commissioners to proceed therein; for under the statute of Ann their chamberlain iea trustee for the corporation, and a bond taken by them in their own name, for securing thq 40s. duty, is no merger of the ordinary remedy given to their chamberlain by the legislature; neither is the right of the chamberlain to sue in the Court of Requests, which has always been the practice, affected by the scintilla of interest which any of the commissioners might be supposed to have as corporators, in the duty to be recovered; though it did not appear that all of them had such interest.

Drew v. Fletcher, 1 Barm and Cres. 98S.

ABSTRACT OF ACTS OF PARLIAMENT

such defendant would have been entitled to, in case this act had not been made, and he or she had been sued for the same debt, or other cause of action, in any of his Majesty's courts at Westminster,or any other court, and had there pleaded such statute in bar to such action or suit.

Consequence of XII. Enacts, That if any action or suit shall be com-

suing in any .

other court. menced in any other court than the said Court of Requests, for any debt not exceeding the sum of five pounds, and recoverable by virtue of the said recited acts, and of this act, or any of them, in the said Court of Requests; then, and in every such case, the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action or suit, shall not, by reason of a verdict for him, her or them, or otherwise, have or be entitled to any costs whatever; and if the verdict shall be given for the defendant or defendants in such action or suit, and the judge or judges before whom the same shall be tried or heard, shall think fit to certify, that such debt ought to have been recovered in the said Court of Requests, then, and so often, such defendant or defendants shall have double costs, and shall have such remedy for recovering the same as any defendant or defendants may have for his, her, or their costs in any cases by law.

In an action of debt on a judgment of this court, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant, when the judgment was obtained, was resident within its jurisdiction. Coore v. Keneday, 3 Esp. Rep. 280.

If the plaintiff, in an action of assault, having recovered only 20s, damages, whereby he is entitled to no more than 20s. costs, bring an action on the judgment, and obtaining judgment by default in that action, enter it up for debt and costs; the court, on affidavit of defendant being resident within the jurisdiction, and liable to be summoned to the Court of Requests, will under this clause set aside the judgment as to the costs. Foott v. Coare, 2 Bos. and Pul. 588.

city of London, jointly with another, bat, after the commencement of an action against him for a small demand, tell the plaintiff that he does not keep the warehouse in question, and the plaintiff, upon inquiry in. the neighbourhood of the warehouse, can obtain no intelligence respecting the defendant; thecourt will not, under this clause,exempt the defendant from payment of costs, on the ground of the verdict being under Si, and that he ought to have been summoned to the Court of Requests. Jefferies v. Watts, 1 New Rep. C. P. 153.

In Dunster v. Day and Smith, 8 East, 238,' it was held, that after judgment by default, and damages assessed upon a writ of inquiry, the defendant might come into court, and move to stay proceedings on payment of the damages assessed without costs.

If a debt be reduced by part payment below 5 before the action brought, the case is within this act. Horn Hughes, 8 East; 348: and see Tocker e. Crosby, 2 Taunt. 169. p. 2. n. (3)

Where the plaintiff in aisumptit failed to prove his special counts, but upon the common counts recovered less than upon the balance of an account, which contained items both on the debit and credit side; held, that by this act he was deprived of costs, it appearing that the defendant resided and traded in London. Fomin Oswell and Another, 1 Maule and Sel. 393.

If the plaintiff recover less than Si. in an action brought in London, where the original debt has been reduced by payments, and not by setoff, the defendant will be permitted, on motion, to enter a suggestion on the roll under this act, in order to have bis costs allowed. Cook Johnson, 2 Price, 19.

The defendant's pleading a tender to an action for goods sold, does not preclude him from entering a suggestion on the roll, to deprive the plaintiff of his costs under this act. Jordan Strong, 5 Maule and Sel. 196.

This act extends to assignees of a bankrupt, and therefore, where a plaintiff, as assignee, recovered less than Si. the conrt ordered a suggestion to be entered on the record to deprive the plaintiff of costs; but defendant having given notice of his intention to dispute the petitioning creditor's debt, &c. (which was proved at the trial), it was holden, that the plaintiff was entitled to the costs thereby occasioned; and the court ordered the suggestion to be entered accordingly.

the term, and signed final judgment on the last day of the term, the court in the next term refused to direct the prothonotary to review his taxation of costs to the plaintiff, on an affidavit stating the former proceedings, and that the defendant was resiant within the jurisdiction of the inferior court; because the defendant ought to have entered a suggestion, and that before final judgment was signed. And to entitle himself to such a suggestion, supposing it to be moved for in time, the defendant must state in the affidavit, not only that he is resiant within the jurisdiction of, but also that he is liable to be warned or summoned to the Court of Requests. After judgment by default, the defendant is still in court for many purposes, one of which is, that of entering such suggestion. Semb. that judgment on a general demurrer to a plea in bar, the matter of which, even if well pleaded, would be no defence to the action, is to be considered as a judgment by default.

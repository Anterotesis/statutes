AWARD OF COMMISSIONERS.

Whereas by an Act passed in the session of Parliament in the thirty-first and thirty-second years of Her present Majesty, intituled " An Act to make better provision for the management and use of the Curragh of Kildare," it is enacted that three commissioners should be appointed to ascertain and decide, amongst other things, the following, namely: —

What (if any) rights of common of pasture, rights of way, or other rights (except the rights of the Crown and public rights of way) exist in, over, or affecting the Curragh, or any part thereof, either by grant, charter, or prescription:

To what persons and for what terms, estates, or interests the rights aforesaid respectively belong:

What (if any) are the lands in respect of which the rights aforesaid respectively are exerciseable:

What (if any) compensation should be given to any party whose rights are or may be injuriously affected by the said Act:

We, the Commissioners duly appointed, having taken the necessary steps and given the notices required by the said Act, and having heard and examined the evidence, oral and documentary, produced before us, do make our award, as follows : —

We have in the first schedule hereunto annexed, to be taken and considered as part of this our award, stated the names of the several persons on whose behalf claims have been made before us under the said Act, the townlands (county of Kildare) in which the lands are respectively situate, and in respect of which the claims have been made, the substance of each claim lodged and brought before us, the compensation claimed (if any), and the terms, estates, or interests, and number of acres, Irish plantation measure, in respect of which such claims are made, with our allowance or disallowance, wholly or in part, of such claims respectively.

We find that no rights of persons legally claiming under the said Act are substantially altered, varied, or injuriously affected by the said Act, and as a matter of fact on the evidence adduced before us, that no right to compensation has been established by any of the claimants, either in respect of the site of the camp, or the rifle-ground, or otherwise.

We further find that, from want of proper authority and neglect on the part of those having the care and management of the Curragh, numerous parties have, from time to time, without having any right so to do, pastured sheep on the Curragh, to the prejudice, loss, and injury of those parties who have acquired legal rights to pasture thereon. We find, from the evidence adduced before us, to such an extent has this taken place, that the pasturage of the Curragh has been rendered to a great extent useless, and that many of the persons whose claims to pasture are by this our award allowed have for many years past been deprived of the use of the pasturage on the Curragh, and It does not appear that the persons so deprived ever took any effective steps to remove those who so prejudicially interfered with the pasturage.

412

Ch. 74. Curragh of Kildare. 33 & 34 Vict.

We further find that large quantities of sheep manure have been from time to time taken off the Curragh by divers parties without any right or privilege so to do; and that the removal of such manure has practically deteriorated the pasturage of the Curragh to a considerable extent.

We further find on the evidence adduced before us, that the right of use of pasturage for any animals other than sheep is unsustained, and that the pasturage on the Curragh is adapted for sheep only (such pasturage being supplementary to the lands in respect of which same is by this our award allowed); and, for the benefit of those entitled to the enjoyment of pasturage on the Curragh, we award accordingly that such pasturage shall be confined to sheep.

We further award that all persons whose claims of right to the use of a well or pond on the Curragh are by this our award recognised and allowed shall respectively enjoy such right and access to such well and pond in the way and by the means particularly shown in and by a map or plan lodged by us with the clerk of the peace for the county of Kildare.

In pursuance of the provisions of the said Act, and to prevent in future the cutting up and injuring of the pasturage of the Curragh, we prescribe, award, and determine that the specific ways in respect of rights of way (other than public rights of way) in, over, or affecting the Curragh, or any part thereof, shall be in the direction and lines particularly shown in and by the said map or plan so lodged by us in the office of the clerk of the peace for the said county of Kildare; such specific rights of way being those only which we have determined, and do hereby determine, as necessary and proper for convenience of the owners and occupiers of lands in respect of which such rights are exerciseable; and we accordingly award that all rights of way (other than public rights of way) in, over, or affecting the Curragh shall, after this our award be exerciseable only, in, along, or across the specific ways laid out on the said map; and that all ways (other than public ways, and herein-before referred to as such) in, over, or affecting the Curragh, except the specific ways aforesaid, shall be stopped up.

We further award that the tenants and occupiers of the lands in respect of which claims have been made and allowed by this our award are to be considered only as entitled to the common of pasture, rights of way, or other rights by this our award allowed, in right of their several landlords, and so long only as their interests as such tenants and occupiers respectively continue, and that such rights are not transferable apart from the occupation of the lands.

And we do by this our award ascertain and decide that the public rights of way existing in, over, or affecting the Curragh are those mentioned in the second schedule hereunto annexed, and to be taken as part of our award, and particularly shown in the said map.

We further award and determine that there are no other rights in or over the Curragh save those by this our award allowed.

In witness whereof we have this 30th day of June 1869 affixed our signatures hereto.

1870. Tramways. Ch. 78.

Order, extend the limit of such local rate to such amount as they shall think fit, and prescribe for the payment of such expenses.

Such local authority, may, for the purposes of such Provisional Order, borrow and take up at interest, on the credit of such local rate, any sums of money necessary for defraying any such expenses; and for the purpose of securing the repayment of any sums so borrowed, together with such interest as aforesaid, such local authority may mortgage to the persons by or on behalf of whom such sums are advanced such local rate; but the exercise of the above-mentioned power shall be subject to the following regulations:

(1.) The money so borrowed shall not exceed such sum as may be sanctioned by the Board of Trade:

(2.) The money may be borrowed for such time, not exceeding thirty years, as such local authority, with the sanction of the Board of Trade, shall determine; and, subject as aforesaid to the repayment within thirty years, such local authority may either pay off the moneys so borrowed by equal annual instalments, or they may in every year set apart as a sinking fund, and accumulate in the way of compound interest by investing the same in the purchase of exchequer bills or other government securities, such sum as will be sufficient to pay off the moneys so borrowed, or a part thereof, at such times as the local authority may determine.

The provisions of " The*Commissioners Clauses Act, 1847," with respect to the mortgages to be executed by the Commissioners, shall apply to any mortgage executed under the foregoing provisions of this section, and for the purposes of such application the said provisions shall be incorporated with this Act.

For the purposes of such incorporation the terms "the special Act," and " the Commissioners," shall be construed to mean respectively a Provisional Order under this Act, and the local authority.

Such local authority shall keep separate accounts of all moneys paid by them in applying for, obtaining, and carrying into effect any such Provisional Order, and in the repayment of moneys borrowed, and of all moneys received by them, by way of rent or tolls in respect of the tramway authorised thereby.

When, after payment of all charges incurred under the authority of this Act, and necessary for giving effect to such Provisional Order, there shall be remaining in the hands of such local authority any of the moneys received by them by way of rent or tolls in respect of the tramway authorised by such Provisional Order, such moneys shall be applied by them to the purposes for which the local rate may be by them applied.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Act of the tenth year of George the Fourth, chapter twenty-four, enabling the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt to grant life annuities and annuities for terms of years, or in the Acts relating to savings banks and post office savings banks, any deposit hereafter made and any annuity granted by the said Commissioners under any of the said Acts in the name of a married woman, or in the name of a woman who may marry after such deposit or grant, shall be deemed to be the separate property of such woman, and the same shall be accounted for and paid to her as if she were an unmarried woman;

[Proviso.]

provided that if any such deposit is made by, or such annuity granted to, a married woman by means of moneys of her husband without his consent, the Court may, upon an application under section nine of this Act, order such deposit or annuity or any part thereof to be paid to the husband.

[As to a married woman's property in the funds.]

3. Any married woman, or any woman about to be married, may apply to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, or to the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland, by a form to be provided by the governor of each of the said banks and company for that purpose, that any sum forming part of the public stocks and funds, and not being less than twenty pounds, to which the woman so applying is entitled, or which she is about to acquire, may be transferred to or made to stand in the books of the governor and company to whom such application is made in the name or intended name of the woman as a married woman entitled to her separate use, and on such sum being entered in the books of the said governor and company accordingly the same shall be deemed to be the separate property of such woman, and shall be transferred and the dividends paid as if she were an unmarried woman; provided that if any such investment in the funds is made by a married woman by means of moneys of her husband without his consent, the Court may, upon an application under section nine of this Act, order such investment and the dividends thereof, or any part thereof, to be transferred and paid to the husband.

[As to a married woman's property in a joint stock company.]

[Deposit of moneys in fraud of creditors invalid.]

6. Nothing herein-before contained in reference to moneys deposited in or annuities granted by savings banks or moneys invested in the funds or in shares or stock of any company shall as against creditors of the husband give validity to any deposit or investment of moneys of the husband made in fraud of such creditors, and any moneys so deposited or invested may be followed as if this Act had not passed.

7. Where any woman married after the passing of this Act shall during her marriage become entitled to any personal property as next of kin or one of the next of kin of an intestate, or to any sum of money not exceeding two hundred pounds under any deed or will, such property shall, subject and without prejudice to the trusts of any settlement affecting the same, belong to the woman for her separate use, and her receipts alone shall be a good discharge for the same.

9. In any question between husband and wife as to property declared by this Act to be the separate property of the wife, either party may apply by summons or motion in a summary way either to the Court of Chancery in England or Ireland according as such property is in England or Ireland, or in England (irrespective of the value of the property) the judge of the County Court of the district, in which either party resides, and thereupon the judge may make such order, direct, such inquiry, and award such costs as he shall think fit; provided that any order made by such judge shall be subject to appeal in the same manner as the order of the same judge made in a pending suit or on an equitable plaint would have been, and the judge may, if either party so require, hear the application in his private room.

10. A married woman may effect a policy of insurance upon her own life or the life of her husband for her separate use and the same and all benefit thereof, if expressed on the face of it to be so effected, shall enure accordingly, and the contract in such policy shall be as valid as if made with an unmarried woman.

[As to insurance of a husband for benefit of his wife.]

A policy of insurance effected by any married man on his own life, and expressed upon the face of it to be for the benefit of his wife or of his wife and children, or any of them, shall enure and be deemed a trust for the benefit of his wife for her separate use, and of his children, or any of them, according to the interest so expressed, and shall not, so long as any object of the trust remains, be subject to the control of the husband or to his creditors, or form part of his estate. When the sum secured by the policy becomes payable, or at any time previously, a trustee thereof may be appointed by the Court of Chancery in England or in Ireland according as the policy of insurance was effected in England or in Ireland, or in England by the judge of the County Court of the district, or in Ireland by the chairman of the Civil Bill Court of the division of the county, in which the insurance office is situated, and the receipt of such trustee shall be a good discharge to the office. If it shall be proved that the policy was effected and premiums paid by the husband with intent to defraud his creditors, they shall be entitled to receive out of the sum secured an amount equal to the premiums so paid.

[Married women may maintain an action.]

11. A married woman may maintain an action in her own name for the recovery of any wages, earnings, money, and property by this Act declared to be her separate property,

1870. Married Women's Property. Ch. 93. 581

or of any property belonging to her before marriage, and which her husband shall, by writing under his hand, have agreed with her shall belong to her after marriage as her separate property, and she shall have in her own name the same remedies, both civil and criminal, against all persons whomsoever for the protection and security of such wages, earnings, money, and property, and of any chattels or other property purchased or obtained by means thereof for her own use, as if such wages, earnings, money, chattels, and property belonged to her as an unmarried woman; and in any indictment or other proceeding it shall be sufficient to allege such wages, earnings, money, chattels, and property to be her property.

[Husband not to be liable on his wife's contracts before marriage.]

12. A husband shall not, by reason of any marriage which shall take place after this Act has come into operation, be liable for the debts of his wife contracted before marriage, but the wife shall be liable to be sued for, and any property belonging to her for her separate use shall be liable to satisfy, such debts as if she had continued unmarried.

[Married woman to be liable to the parish for the maintenance of her husband.]

13. Where in England the husband of any woman having separate property becomes chargeable to any union or parish, the justices having jurisdiction in such union or parish may,in petty sessions assembled, upon application of the guardians of the poor, issue a summons against the wife, and make and enforce such order against her for the maintenance of her husband as by the thirty-third section of "The Poor Law Amendment Act, 1868," they may now make and enforce against a husband for the maintenance of his wife who becomes chargeable to any union or parish. Where in Ireland relief is given under the provisions of the Acts relating to the relief of the destitute poor to the husband of any woman having separate property, the cost price of such relief is hereby declared to be a loan from the guardians of the union in which the same shall be given, and shall be recoverable from such woman as if she were a feme sole by such and the same actions and proceedings as money lent.

[Married woman to be liable to the parish for the maintenance of her children.]

14. A married woman having separate property shall be subject to all such liability for the maintenance of her children as a widow is now by law subject to for the maintenance of her children: Provided always, that nothing in this Act shall relieve her husband from any liability at present imposed upon him by law to maintain her children.

[Commencement of Act.]

15. This Act shall come into operation at the time of the passing of this Act.

[Extent of Act.]

16. This Act shall not extend to Scotland.

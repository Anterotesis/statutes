annuity was paid or secured under the said Act, by reason of the discontinuance of the Parliamentary grant commonly called and in the said Act referred to as "the Regram " Donum," might apply to the Commissioners in the said Act mentioned to commute his annuity for a capital sum to be paid to him, and the said Commissioners, if satisfied that the annuity of the applicant Was not encumbered, or if encumbered that the encumbrancers consented to the commutation, should cause the then present value of the annuity to be estimated, and should pay the amount of such estimated value to trustees, such trustees to be appointed in the case of any such minister or assistant minister as aforesaid by such minister or assistant minister and the general assembly or synod or presbytery, as the case might be, of the church or religious community to which such minister or assistant minister might belong:

And whereas it was by the said Act also enacted that the said Commissioners should at any time between the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one and the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, but not afterwards, if it appeared to them as respected any Protestant non-conforming body or communion, that not less than three fourths of the whole number of the ministers of such body or communion authorised to commute under the said Act had commuted or agreed to commute their life interests, pay, in addition to the moneys otherwise payable by them, a sum equal to twelve pounds in the hundred on the commutation money payable in respect of each life interest, such addition to be disposed of in the same manner as the commutation money in respect of which it was added:

And whereas upwards of three fourths of the whole number of the ministers of the general assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland authorised to commute under the said Act have already commuted their life interests for capital sums under the provisions of the said Act (which ministers who have already commuted as aforesaid are herein-after designated " the said commuting ministers "):

And whereas the said commuting ministers and the said general assembly duly appointed the several persons hereinafter named to be trustees to receive the said capital sums pursuant to the said Act:

And whereas, in order to enable the said trustees to pay to each of the said commuting ministers an annuity for his life, provided he should so long continue in his office of minister of the said church, equal to the annuity commuted by him as aforesaid, and at the same time to preserve undiminished -the entire amount of the said commutation money as a source of permanent endowment for the said church, certain members of the said church agreed to noise by voluntary annual contribution or otherwise a certain amount of income, to be

called "the sustentation fond" of the said church (and hereinafter designated as "the said sustentation fund7'), the same to be applied in each and every year so long as any such fife annuity should be payable as aforesaid to supplement the annual income arising from the said commutation money, so far as might be required for the payment in full of the several annuities so to be paid as aforesaid:

And whereas the management of the said sustentation fund, so far as regards the raising the same, has been duly entrusted to a committee elected and to be elected by the said general assembly of the said Presbyterian Church;

And whereas donations and bequests to the said sustentation fund were directed to be funded by the said commutation trustees, if the donors or testators should so desire:

And whereas the said commuting ministers, having been desirous of co-operating in the formation of such sustentation fund, agreed that the said commutation money payable in respect of their several and respective life interests as aforesaid should be vested in the said trustees, on certain trust contained in and declared by an indenture dated the thirteenth day of July one thousand eight hundred and seventy, and made between the said commuting ministers of the first, second, third, and fourth parts, and the said trustees of the fifth part:

And whereas by the said indenture it was agreed and declared that the said trustees should apply for and receive from the said Commissioners the commutation moneys payable by them in respect of the annuities of the said commuting ministers, and should stand possessed thereof on the trusts in the said indenture as aforesaid:

And whereas the said trustees have received or will shortly receive the said commutation moneys payable by the said Commissioners as aforesaid in respect of the annuities of the said commuting ministers (including as well the amount of the estimated value of the said annuities respectively as also the aid twelve pounds per cent, additional payable on the contingency aforesaid):

And whereas several of the ministers of the said general assembly who have not yet commuted the annuities payable to them respectively under the said Act may yet do so:

And whereas certain colleges and other property and trust fimds connected therewith which have been given and bequeathed for the education of ministers for the said church are now vested in certain parties as trustees for the said church; and there are also churches, manses, and other property connected therewith, now vested in certain parties as trustees, for congregations connected with the said church; and there are also trust funds and moneys which have been given and bequeathed by members of the said church, for missions and other charities connected with said church, and said trust funds and moneys axe now vested in or under the control of

WHEREAS an unlawful society, combination, and con-federacy of a secret nature, generally known by the name of the Ribbon Society, at present exists within the county of Westmeath, and certain adjoining portions of the county of Meath and of the King's County:

And whereas owing to the prevalence of the said society murder and other crimes of the most serious nature have been perpetrated within the districts above referred to, and by reason partly of sympathy with the perpetrators of such crimes, and still more by the terror created by the action of the said society, the existing laws have been found to be insufficient for the due protection of life and property in the districts aforesaid:

And whereas it is therefore expedient that further and other provision should be made for the protection of life and property within the said districts:

lflJL PiMic Meajtfk (Scotland) Act (1867) Amt OH. 38.

CHAP. 38.

An Act for amending the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1867. [13th July 1871.]

WHEREAS it has been found that the powers of assess-** ment and borrowing contained in the Act passed in the thirtieth and thirty-first year of Her Majesty's reign, chapter one hundred and one, intituled " An Act to consolidate and u amend the law relating to the Public Health in Scotland," are insufficient to enable the Local Authorities to execute the said Act, and it is expedient to amend the said Act in these respects:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

SCHEDULE to which the foregoing Act refers.

General Principles of the Methodist Constitution agreed upon in Dublin at a Meeting of Representatives held on the 5th and 6th January 1818, and fully agreed to and ratified at a General Meeting convened at Clones, on the 21 st instant, to re-establish Methodism on its original basis, agreeably to Primitive Wesleyan Methodism*

Q. I. What is requisite to form and cement a Christian society ?

A. Unity of Design, Unity of Doctrine, and Uniformity of Discipline.

1st.—Of Design.

Q. 2. What is the Design of the Methodist Society ?

A. It is thus expressed by Mr. Wesley:—"A body of people, " who, being of no sect or party, are friends to all parties; and 44 endeavour to forward all in heart religion, in the knowledge and (t love of God and man."

X 3

Proviso for cases in which the equity of redemption of the premises may be barred or released.

How expenses of Act to be paid.

Ch. 40. Prim. Weal. Meth. Society (I.) Regulation. 34&35 Vict.

Q. 3. In what point of view, then, does the Methodist Society consider itself ?

A. Not as an independent Church, nor its preachers as independent ministers; preachers and people conjointly constitute a purely Religious Society to build each other up; to enjoy the blessings of Christian fellowship, and to promote, by precept and example, the knowledge and practice of vital godliness.

Q. 4. Does this imply a distinct and separate communion, in celebrating the two Christian Ordinances, Baptism and the Lard's Supper ?

A. By no means; as the members of the Methodist Society may belong to external visible Churches established under different forms; each member is left at perfect liberty to partake of those Ordinances in the communion to winch he or she respectively belongs.

Q. 5. Does not the Methodist Society profess to belong to the Church of England ?

A. Yes, as a body; for they originally emanated from the Church of England; and the Rev. John Wesley, the venerable founder of the Connection, made a declaration of similar import within less than a year preceding his decease, viz.:—" I declare once more, that I f' live and die a member of the Church of England; and that none " who regard my judgment or advice will ever separate from it," (See Arminian Magazine, for April, 1790.) This, however, is not now to be understood as interfering with the right of private judgment, in cases where education or prejudices attach members to other Established Churches.

2nd.—Op Doctbine.

Q. 6. What is the foundation of the Methodist Doctrines ?

A. The canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Testament.

Q. 7. Wherein consists the Unity of the Methodist Doctrine ?

A. In teaching and enforcing those doctrines only which are contained in the Scriptures, as taught and explained in the writings of the Rev. John Wesley, and Rev. John Fletcher, particularly Mr. Wesley's notes on the Old and New Testament, his eight volumes of Sermons, his appeals, and the doctrinal parts of the Arminim Magazine as maintained by him, and published to the period of his decease, also Mr. Fletcher's Checks and letters, published by Mr. Wesley.

3rd.—Of Discipline.

Q. 8. How is the discipline of the Methodist body to be regulated so as to be uniform throughout the Connection ?

A. By the general principles and regulations laid down in Mr. Wesley's larger Minutes, as published by himself in the year 1789.

Q. 9. What shall we do in order to preserve Methodism in its original state in Ireland, as at the period of Mr. Wesley's decease in March, 1791 ?

A- By a recurrence to original principles, re-establish Methodism in its primitive simplicity, appointing to each their duty and station.

Q. 10. What are the gradations of station in the Methodist Connection ?

A. First,—Preachers.

Second,—Stewards and Leaders.

Third,—Private Members.

Q. 11. What is the office of a Methodist Preacher ?

A. His sole vocation as called and sent out by the Methodist Connection, is to declare a free, universal, and everlasting Gospel, which is glad tidings to all people, through the merits of Christ

247

1871. Prim. West. Methodist Society (J.) Regulation. Ch. 40.

alone, agreeably to that declaration of St. Paul—"I am sent not u to baptize, but to preach the Gospel."

Q. 12. Is this view of his calling agreeable to Mr. Wesley's opinion, and that discipline which he established ?

A. Mr. Wesley declared it to be so, both from the pulpit and the press; in full corroboration of this truth, we refer particularly to a Sermon of his, preached in Cork, on Heb. v. 4, and afterwards published by himself in the Arminian Magazine, for June, 1790, in which discourse he has clearly shown that the office of a priest is totally distinct and separate from the office of a preacher or expounder of God's Word and Will, sometimes called a prophet.

Q. 13. Has not Mr. Wesley's exposition of that text, Heb. v. and 4, been controverted ?

A. It has been controverted by some of the preachers, who wished to break in upon the Scriptural and uniform plan of Mr. Wesley's discipline. But we adopt the principles there laid down, and receive Preachers under this view of their office only.

Q. 14. What is the office of a Leader ?

A. To take the spiritual charge of a certain number of persons committed to his care, in what is called a class: to meet them collectively every week; and, if possible, see each member of his class weekly. He is regularly to attend the leader's meeting, in places where such meeting is established. He is to be present at every quarterly meeting, if not unavoidably prevented; and assist the Preachers of the Circuit in every matter relative to the good government of the Society, according to our declared fundamental principles.

Q. 15. What is the qualification for a Leader ?

A. He is to be a person of approved and upright conversation and conduct; and one that enjoys the happiness of possessing sound Christian experience. And before he is fully permitted to the office and privileges of a leader, he is to subscribe in a book, to be provided for the purpose, in each Circuit, to these fundamental principles, which are herein laid down as a basis of the Methodist Constitution, according to original principles.

Q. 16. What is the duty of a Steward ?

A. To take the general eharge of the temporal concerns of the Society or Circuit in which he is appointed, particularly of all the money transactions, both receipts and disbursements, in all which he is to act faithfully, as one who is to give a strict account to God.

Q. 17. What is the duty of Private Members ?

A. To abide in their station, according to the rules of the Society, published by Mr. Wesley.

Q. 18. To whom is confided the government of the Connection ?

A. To the Conference.

Q, 19. Did Mr. Wesley establish a Conference ?

A He did; a conference of preachers directed by himself, received and sent out according to the principles maintained by him in his exposition of Heb. v. 4 before-mentioned.

Q. 20. Why do we separate from the majority of the Conference, claiming to be the successors of that established by Mr. Wesley ?

A Because they have changed the discipline established by Mr. Wesley. Not content with the honourable office of being preachers of the Gospel simply, they have assumed to themselves the priestly office, by administering the Ordinances of Baptism and the Lordrs Supper, without appointment or ordination, against Mr. Wesley's express opinion on the subject.

248

Q. 21. Has it not been urged that Mr. Wesley himself ordained some Preachers to administer the Ordinances; and has not this been resorted to as an apology by the preachers, for their late innovation ?

A. Supposing it to be true, that Mr. Wesley was prevailed upon to select for such an appointment, it is the fullest confirmation, that his decided opinion was against the administration of the Ordinances by the preachers generally; therefore, this attempt to shelter themselves under the sanction of Mr. Wesley's authority is perfectly nugatory, and carries its own refutation.

Q. 22. In consequence of the loose principles of discipline Bet afloat in supporting the late innovation, the very great irregularity has been maintained by some, of the right of a private celebration of the Ordinances amongst themselves; what is our opinion of such practice ?

A. We consider the principle as calculated to produce confusion in the Church of God, and the practice to bring the Ordinances into contempt; we therefore judge, that persons concerned in such irregular administration shall be excluded from our Society.

Q. 23. As the Conference is the governing body, who constitute the Conference ?

A. All the travelling Preachers in the Connection, and one Steward or Leader from each Circuit, to be annually elected by the Stewards and Leaders convened at a quarterly meeting.

Q. 24. Have all the members of Conference so constituted an equal voice in the concerns of the body ?

A. During the examination of the Preachers' characters, Preachers only are to be present and decide. During the appointments to the Circuits, all the members maybe present and give their opinion; but the Preachers are to decide. During every other business or discussion, all the members may sit, speak, and vote without distinction.

Q. 25. How is the stationing of Preachers to be regulated ?

A. By a stationing committee, to be elected by Conference annually, to consist of an equal number of Preachers and Representatives, who, in the committee, are all to have an equal voice in making the arrangement, which is to be submitted to Conference, as under the foregoing question and answer.

Q. 26. What is the regulation respecting the receiving of new Preachers ?

A. No person can be received as a Preacher who does not come recommended by the Stewards and Leaders of the Circuit to which he belongs, assembled at a quarterly meeting.

Q. 27. Why is one Steward or Leader from each Circuit appointed to sit in Conference ?

A. To assist by their counsel and advice in matters of vital importance to the Connection; and to take the labour and responsibility of managing the financial concerns, in order to relieve the Preachers from the weight of temporal matters, which might interfere with their usefulness.

Q. 28. Is this any deviation from Primitive Methodism ?

A. We conceive not. It is both rational and Scriptural; and the principle of an open Conference is admitted by Mr. Wesley, in * See Mr. Wes- the first formation of Methodism.*

ley's Minutes Q. 29. What shall be done to prevent the evil which might arise 1746 year *n future> by attempted encroachment on these fundamental principles ?

A. Let every member of the Conference, as a qualification to sit,

24a

1871. Prim. West. Methodist Society (I.) Regulation. Ch.40,41.

speak, or vote therein, declare under his hand, in a book to be provided for the purpose, his unfeigned assent and consent thereto; and his sincere determination to abide in strict conformity to them, as long as he shall continue a member of the Conference, and let all the General Acts, and specific regulations of Conference, proceed accordingly.

Q. 30. Can any further barrier be placed to resist and suppress a future spirit of innovation ?

A. As we uniformly declare, that our one object is to constitute a Religious Society, and preserve harmony among ourselves, and not to erect ourselves into a new Church, we do hereby pronounce our judgment, that if any member of the Conference shall propose any resolution subversive of this principle, or opposed to the Design, Doctrine, or Discipline herein contained, he is unworthy to be a member of the Conference, and thereby excludes himself

SCHEDULE A.

Past I.

Regvlations vn respect of testing apparatus.

1. The apparatus for testing the illuminating power of the gas shall consist of the improved form of Bunsen's photometer, known as Letheby's open 60-inch photometer, or Evans* enclosed 100-inch photometer, together with a proper meter, minute clock, governor, pressure gauge, and balance.

The burner to be used for testing the gas shall be such as shall be prescribed.

The candles used for testing the gas shall be sperm candles of six to the pound, and two candles shall be used together.

2. The apparatus—

(o.) For testing the presence in the gas of sulphuretted hydrogen. —A glass vessel containing a strip of bibulous paper moistened with a solution of acetate of lead, containing sixty grains of crystallized acetate of lead dissolved in one fluid ounce of water.

260

Ch.4] . Gasworks Clauses Act (1847) Amendment. 34 & 35 Vict.

Part II.

Rules as to mode of testing gas.

I. Mode of testing for illuminating power.

The gas in the photometer is to be lighted at least fifteen minutes before the testings begin, and it is to be kept continuously burning from the beginning to the end of the tests.

Each testing shall include ten observations of the photometer made at intervals of a minute.

The consumption of the gas is to be carefully adjusted to five cubic feet per hour.

The candles are to be lighted at least ten minutes before beginning each testing, so as to arrive at their normal rate of burning, which is shown when the wick is slightly bent and the tip glowing. The standard rate of consumption for the candles shall be 120 grains each per hour. Before and after making each set of ten observations of the photometer the gas examiner shall weigh the candles, and if the combustion shall have been more or less per candle than 120 grains per hour he shall make and record the calculations requisite to neutralise the effects of this difference.

The average of each set of ten observations is to be taken as representing the illuminating power of that testing.

(a.) For sulphuretted hydrogen.—The gas shall be passed through the glass vessel containing the strip of bibulous paper moistened with the solution of acetate of lead for a period of three minutes, or such longer period as may be prescribed; and if any discolouration of the test paper is found to have taken place, this is to be held conclusive as to the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen in the gas.

Repeal of Acts.

An Act to repeal divers enactments relating to Oaths and Declarations *which are not in force; and for other purposes connected therewith.

[13th July 1871.]

WHEREAS divers Acts and parts of Acts relating to oaths and declarations have been virtually repealed by divers recent Acts, and in particular by an Act of the session of the twenty-ninth and thirtieth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter twenty-two, intituled "An Act to render " it unnecessary to take and subscribe oert&in declarations " as a qualification for offices and employments, to indemnify u such persons as have omitted to qualify themselves for office " and employment, and for other purposes relating thereto" and by The Promissory Oaths Act, 1868; and it is expedient, with a view to the revision of the statute law, and particularly to the preparation of the revised edition of the statutes now in progress, expressly to repeal the Acts and parts of Acts so virtually repealed, and other parts of the same Acts which have ceased to be in force:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L The Acts specified in the first parts of the first, second, and third schedules and in the fourth schedule to this Act are hereby wholly repealed, and the Acts specified in the second parts of the first, second, and third schedules to this Act are hereby repealed to the extent in the third column of those parts of the said schedules mentioned; provided that,—

(X.) This repeal shall not affect the validity, invalidity, effect, or consequences of anything done or suffered before the passing of this Act, or any status, capacity, right, title, or indemnity existing, acquired, or accrued before the passing of this Act, or any remedy or proceeding in respect thereof, or any privilege, exemption, or benefit to which any person would be entitled if this Act had not passed:

Where by the recited Acts or this Act any person is prevented or relieved from taking any oath or making or subscribing any declaration, the taking, making, or subscribing of which forms a condition pfrecedenl or subsequent to the attainment by such person of any office, privilege, exemption, or other benefit, or the due performance of any act, such person shall nevertheless, on complying with the other conditions, if any, attached to the attainment of such office, privilege, exemption, or other benefit, or the due performance of such act, be entitled thereto, and be deemed duly to have performed such act, in the same manner as if the condition relating to such oath or declaration, and any directions as to the certificate or registration of the taking of such oath, or making or subscribing such declaration, or otherwise, had been fulfilled and performed.

2, Whereas by The Promissory Oaths Act, 1868, it is Persons before provided that the oaths of allegiance and judicial oath should

be taken by each of certain officers therein mentioned, in w e * manner in which the oaths required to be taken by such officer previously to the passing of that Act would have been taken; and it is desirable, with a view to the revision of the statute law, to define the manner in which such oaths are to he taken: Be it enacted that each such officer shall take the said oaths before such persons as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint; or,

In England, before the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, or in the Court of Chancery, Queen's Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer, in open court before one or more of the judges of such court* or in open court at the general or quarter sessions of the peace for the county, borough, or place in which the person taking the oaths acts as justice:

In Scotland, in the Court of Session in open court before one or more of the judges of that court, or in open court at the quarter sessions of the peace for the county, borough, or place in which the person taking the oaths acts as justice, or in open court before the court of the sheriff of the county for which the person taking the oaths acts as justice:

In Ireland, before the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, or in the Court of Chancery, Queen's Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer, in open court before one or more of the judges of such court, or at the quarter sessions of the peace for the county in which the person taking the oath acts as justice.

And whereas it has been found necessary for the purpose of improving the site of the said courts of justice and the approaches thereto that the said commissioners should also be empowered to acquire the additional lands described and shown on the plans herein-after mentioned (which lands are in this Act referred to as " the additional lands "), but such lands cannot be acquired without the authority of Parliament: And whereas duplicate plans describing the situation of the said additional lands, with a book of reference thereto containing the names of the owners and lessees or reputed owners and lessees and of the occupiers thereof, have been deposited with the clerk of the peace for the county of Middlesex, at his office at the Sessions House, Clerkenwell, and with the clerk of the Board of Works for the Strand district of parishes; and it is expedient that powers should be given to the said commissioners to acquire such additional lands for the purposes aforesaid:

4.

5. If the commissioners, in the execution of any works upon any of the lands acquired under the authority of this Act, discover any human remains, or any monuments or tombstones, they shall decently remove such remains, monuments, and tombstones, and dispose of the same in such manner and subject to such conditions as the Bishop of London and the rector of the parish of Saint Clement Danes for the time being shall jointly approve.

38.

SCHEDULE.

SCHEME

For the application and management of certain Charities founded by the settlement of Christopher Tancred, of Whixley in the county of York, Esquire, deceased.

Notwithstanding the provisions of any Act of Parliament or scheme now in force for the regulation of the charities, it shall be lawful for the Charity Commissioners, upon the application of the Governors, to establish a scheme providing for the following objects; viz.,—

1. The discontinuance of the Whixley Manor House as a hospital

or place of residence for the pensioners, at such time or times, and in such manner, and subject to such provisions and regulations and the payment of such compensations as may be determined by the scheme, with a due regard to the rights and interests, pecuniary or residentiary, of the existing pensioners and officers of the charity:

2. Granting in future, out of that part of the income of the charity

which is now appropriated to the pensioners, to twelve pensioners, qualified as specified in the settlement, out-pensions of eighty pounds a year in lieu of the residence at Whixley House and other emoluments; such pensions to be forfeited if alienated for debt, or otherwise, and to cease if it shall appear to the Governors that the continuance of them is from a change in the circumstances of the pensioners no longer required or from misconduct of the pensioners inexpedient:

8. Enabling the Governors with the sanction of the Commissioners to deal with the Whixley Manor House and appurtenances in such manner as may be considered from time to time desirable; and when the surplus of the .pensioners part of the income of the charity, after paying such out-pensions as aforesaid, shall be sufficient for the purpose, to establish a school for the benefit primarily of the children of poor persons from those classes for whom the said Christopher Tancred founded his pensions:

4. Enabling the Society of Lincoln's Inn to appoint some member of their bench as their nominee to be a member of the corporation of the Governors in lieu of the treasurer of the society, and from time to time to vary such appointment.

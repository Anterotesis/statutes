CHAPTER 8.

An Act for the Regulation of Her Majesty's Royal Marine Forces while on shore. [22d April 1875.]

WHEREAS it is judged necessary for the safety of the United Kingdom, and the defence of the possessions of this realm, that a body of Royal Marine forces should be employed in Her Majesty's fleet and naval service, under the direction of the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom, or the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid:

And whereas the said forces may frequently be quartered or be on shore, or sent to do duty or be on board transport ships or merchant ships or vessels, or ships or vessels of Her Majesty, or other ships or vessels, or they may be under other circumstances in which they will not be subject to the laws relating to the government of Her Majesty's forces by sea:

And whereas no man can be forejudged of life or limb, or subjected in time of peace to any kind of punishment within this realm, by martial law, or in any other manner than by the judgment of his peers, and according to the known and established laws of this realm; yet nevertheless it being requisite for the retaining of such forces in their duty that an exact discipline be observed, and that marines who shall mutiny or stir up sedition, or shall desert Her Majesty's service, or be guilty of any other crime or offence in breach of or to the prejudice of good order and discipline, be brought to a more exemplary and speedy punishment than the usual forms of the law will allow:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

An Act for the farther Amendment of the Laws relating to Turnpike Roads in South Wales.

[29th June 1875.]

WHEREAS by an Act passed in the session of the seventh and eighth years of Her present Majesty, chapter ninety-one, and intituled " An Act to consolidate and amend the Laws " relating to Turnpike Trusts in South Wales," the Public Works Loan Commissioners were empowered to make loans to be severally secured by way of annuity on the respective county roads funds to be formed and county road rates to be levied under the said Act in the six counties following; that is to say, the counties of Glamorgan, Brecknock, Radnor, Carmarthen, Pembroke, and Cardigan; and the said Commissioners, in pursuance of such power, have made loans on the security of the said several funds and rates:

And whereas by section ninety-five of the said Act it is enacted that whenever it appears to the county roads board for any of the said counties at their annual general meeting that the county roads fund for their county will during the coming year be insufficient for the payment as well of the sums charged thereon by way of annuity to the said Commissioners, as of the expenses of the management and repair of the several turnpike roads in such county, such county roads board shall certify the amount that will be necessary in addition to such county roads fund to meet the several purposes aforesaid, subject nevertheless to the following proviso, viz. a That the sum " so certified by any coimty roads board to be required in aid " of such county roads fund shall in no case exceed the yearly " sum which shall be payable by way of annuity as aforesaid " to the said Public Works Loan Commissioners by the county a in which such sum shall be required

And whereas by section ninety-six of the said Act it is enacted that the justices of any such county at their general quarter sessions assembled shall levy a county roads rate in the nature of a county rate, for the purpose of raising the amount so certified to be required by the county roads board: And whereas the loans so made by the said Commissioners as aforesaid have been in great part repaid, but the funds under the control of the said county roads boards will not in future be sufficient to enable them without the aid of the said county roads rate to defray the expenses of the management and repair of the turnpike roads in some of the said several counties, and it is therefore expedient that provision should be made whereby such rate may continue to.be levied, subject to the restrictions herein-after contained:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords

Provided that, notwithstanding anything in the said ninety-sixth section of the said recited Act contained, it shall not be obligatory upon the justices of any county to raise by the levying of a county road rate the whole or any part of the sum certified by any county roads board as aforesaid, except so far as the same may be required by such county in respect of the yearly sums payable as aforesaid to the Public Works Loan Commissioners.

BE it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L This Act shall be construed as one with the Act of the session of the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter nineteen (in this Act referred to as the principal Act); and the expression " this Act," when used in the principal Act, shall be deemed to include this Act The principal Act and this Act may be cited together as the Pacific Islanders Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and each of them may be cited separately as the Pacific Islanders Protection Act of the year in which it was passed.

2. Whereas by section three of the principal Act it is enacted that it shall not be lawful for any British vessel to carry native labourers of the islands in the Pacific Ocean referred to in the said Act, not being part of the crew of such vessel, unless the master has given such bond as is therein mentioned, and has obtained from a governor of one of the Australasian colonies or a British consular officer a license in the form contained in Schedule B. to the said Act:

1875.

Pacific Islanders Protection.

Ch. 51.

331

And whereas such license does not authorise the carrying in a British vessel of the said native labourers for the purpose of carrying on any fishery, industry, or occupation in connexion with the said vessel, and it is expedient to authorise the same: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The license mentioned in sections three and five of the principal Act may authorise a British vessel to carry native labourers in such vessel for the purpose of carrying on any fishery, industry, or occupation in connexion with the said vessel, and may for that purpose be in the form contained in the Schedule B. to this Act, in lieu of the form contained in Schedule B. to the principal Act, and the bond mentioned in section three of the principal Act shall in such case be in the form contained in Schedule A. to this Act in lieu of the form contained in Schedule A. to the principal Act.

If a native labourer, carried in pursuance of a license issued under this section, is not engaged in like manner as a seaman forming part of the crew of the vessel, by an agreement made in accordance with the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, and the Acts amending the same, the engagement of such labourer shall be recorded in such manner and with such particulars as may be from time to time prescribed by Her Majesty by Order in Council, but in all cases the name of the labourer engaged shall be entered in the official log with particulars sufficient to identify such labourer.

3. Whereas by sections six and sixteen of the principal Act provision is made with respect to the detention, seizure, and bringing in for adjudication of a British vessel suspected of being employed or found employed in the commission of the offences therein mentioned, or otherwise as in the said sections mentioned, and it is expedient to amend such provision: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Where a British vessel may, under the principal Act, be detained, seized, and brought in for adjudication by any officer, all goods and effects found on board such vessel may also be detained, seized, and brought in for adjudication by such officer, either with or without such vessel; and all the provisions of the principal Act referring to the seizure or detention of a vessel shall, so far as is consistent with the tenor thereof, be construed also to refer to the seizure and detention of such goods and effects.

4. Whereas it is expedient to amend the provisions made by the principal Act with respect to the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Courts: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The High Court of Admiralty of England and every Vice-Admiralty Court in Her Majesty's dominions out of the United Kingdom shall have jurisdiction to try and condemn as forfeited to Her Majesty or restore any vessel, goods, and effects alleged to be detained or seized in pursuance of the principal Act or of this Act, and on restoring the same to

For the purposes of the principal Act and this Act, any court mentioned in this section shall have the same powers as are by sections twelve and thirteen of the principal Act (which sections relate to the issue of commissions for the examination of witnesses and other matters relative to obtaining evidence) vested in the supreme court of any of the Australasian colonies, and further all powers which such court has in the case of any vessel, goods, and effects, or matter brought before it in the exercise of its jurisdiction under any other Act or otherwise.

5. Sections nineteen and twenty of the principal Act, which relate to proceedings instituted in and an award of damages by a Vice-Admiralty Court in respect of the seizure or detention of a vessel, shall extend to any such proceedings and award by the High Court of Admiralty of England, and to any such proceedings and award, either in that Court or any Vice-Admiralty Court, in respect of the seizure or detention of any goods or effects authorised by this Act to be seized or detained.

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L This Act may be cited for all purposes as The Canada Copyright Act, 1875.

2. In the construction of this Act the words " book " and " copyright " shall have respectively the same meaning as in the Act of the fifth and sixth years of Her Majesty's reign, chapter forty-five, intituled " An Act to amend the Law of " Copyright/'

3. It shall be lawful for Her Majesty in Council to assent to the said reserved Bill, as contained in the schedule to this Act annexed, and if Her Majesty shall be pleased to signify Her assent thereto, the said Bill shall come into operation at such time and in such manner as Her Majesty may by Order in Council direct; anything in the Act of the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth years of the reign of Her Majesty, chapter ninety-three, or in any other Act to the contrary notwithstanding.

Court empowered to authorise heir of entail to borrow money to defray the cost of improvements on the entailed estate.

7. From and after the passing of this Act, it shall be lawful for the court, on the application of the heir of entail in possession of an entailed estate in Scotland holden by virtue of any tailzie dated prior to the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, to grant authority to such heir of entail to borrow money to defray the C03t of improvements on such estate, whether the same have already been executed by him or are in the course of execution, or are merely contemplated at the date of the application, and whether the same if executed prior to the date of the application were executed before or after the passing of this Act, and to grant security therefor to the lender in the manner herein-after provided, such heir of entail having paid the cost of such improvements as may have been executed prior to the date of the application, or being liable for the same so far as unpaid: Provided as follows:

(1.) The court shall be satisfied that any improvements executed prior to the date of the application are of a substantial nature and beneficial to the estate as at the date of the application to the extent of at least the sum authorised to be borrowed:

(2.) The court shall be satisfied with respect to any improvements in course of execution, or contemplated, that the same, if well executed, will be of a substantial nature and beneficial to the estate:

1875. Entail Amendment (Scotland). Ch. 61. 563

(6.)

When the application is for authority to borrow money on the security of the estate to defray the cost of improvements thereon executed prior to the date of the application, the process shall be at an end on the court granting the prayer of the application; in every other case the process shall subsist as a depending process until the whole money authorised to be borrowed shall be paid away under the authority of the court, as herein-after provided:

(8.) In every such case as that last mentioned, the court in granting their authority shall make an order for the consignation in bank of the whole amount of the loan authorised on a receipt payable to the orders of court, and such order for consignation shall be set forth in the security to be granted by the heir of entail as after mentioned, and shall be obligatory on the lender; and thereafter the court may make such orders and give such directions in the process as they may think necessary from time to time for the inspection of the works of improvement in course of execution, for ensuring that the improvements shall be well executed, and may, on motion made in the process, grant orders from time to time for payment out of the consigned money to the applicant, or in the case of his death to his personal representative or other successor entitled thereto and sisted in the process as herein-after provided, of the cost of the improvements so far as executed to their satisfaction, paid for by him or for which he is liable, and of the expenses of the loan and security and of the process.

8. It shall be lawful for an heir of entail in possession of an Heir of entail entailed estate in Scotland h olden by virtue of any tailzie authority dated prior to the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight (notwithstanding any provisions to bond over the the contrary contained in the tailzie), who has obtained the authority of the court to borrow money under this Act hJn<L ec on the security of the estate, to charge the fee and rents of

such estate other than the mansion-house, offices, and policies thereof, or the fee and rents of any portion of such estate other than as aforesaid, with a bond of annual rent, binding himself and his heirs of tailzie to make payment of an annual rent for twenty-five years from and after the date of such authority of the court, or, where the money has been consigned as aforesaid, from and after the expiration of two years from the date of consignation, such annual rent to be payable by equal moieties half-yearly, and to be at a rate not exceeding seven pounds two shillings per annum for every one hundred pounds so authorised to be borrowed, and so in proportion for any greater or less sum; or, where the improvements were executed before the date of the application to the court, in the option of such heir in possession, and in lieu of such bond of annual rent, with a bond and disposition in security over such estate, or any portion thereof, other than as aforesaid, for two thirds of the sum on which the amount of such bond of annual rent, if granted, would be calculated in terms of this Act, with interest thereof at the rate to be stated in such bond and disposition in security from the date aforesaid till repaid, with corresponding penalties, and such bond and disposition in security may be in the like form and shall have the like effect and operation, and be subject to the like conditions and provisions as to keeping down interest as are made and provided by the said Act of the eleventh and * twelfth years of the reign of Her Majesty, chapter thirty-six, and any Acts amending the same, in regard to bonds and dispositions in security authorised to be granted in respect of provisions to younger children, and the granting of such bond of annual rent or bond and disposition in security shall operate as a discharge of all claims for or on account of the improvements with reference to which such bonds of annual rent or bonds and dispositions in security are hereby authorised to be granted.

9. And whereas it is expedient that where an estate in Scotland holden by virtue of any tailzie dated prior to the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight has, before the passing of this Act, been duly charged with the cost of improvements executed thereon, and shall continue charged therewith after the passing of this Act, the heir of entail in possession thereof at or after the passing of this Act should be entitled to relief in the manner but subject to the conditions herein-after provided: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) It shall be lawful for such heir of entail, with the consent of the nearest heir for the time entitled to succeed to the said estate, in case he or any of his predecessors in possession of the estate shall have granted a bond or bonds of annual rent over the

estate or any portion thereof, or otherwise imposed or created a rentcharge or rentcharges thereon in respect of improvements executed under the Act of the tenth year of the reign of His Majesty King George the Third, chapter fifty* one, or under the Act of the eleventh and twelfth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter thirty-six, or any Act amending either of these Acts, or under " The Improvement of Land Act, 1864," or any Act amending the same, or any other Act authorising the loan of money for the improvement of land, and in case such bond or bonds of annual rent or rentcharge or rentcharges continues or continue to affect the estate at the time, to agree with the creditor in any such bond of annual rent or rentcharge for the substitution therefor of a bond and disposition in security over the estate or any portion thereof, other than as in the preceding section mentioned, for the portion then remaining unpaid of the sum on which the amount of such bond of annual rent, or of such rentcharge, was calculated, or otherwise to obtain from any person willing to advance the same, money on loan to pay to the creditor the portion of such sum then unpaid as aforesaid, under such bond of annual rent or rentcharge if the creditor will consent to receive the same, and, having obtained the sanction of the court to such agreement, to grant bond and disposition in security in terms thereof in favour of such creditor or other person, and such boud and disposition in security, if in favour of the creditor, shall operate as an absolute discharge by him of such bond of annual rent or rentcharge:

(2.) Bonds and dispositions in security granted in terms of this section shall set forth the rate of interest stipulated to be paid from the date of the advance until repayment, with corresponding penalties, and may be in the form, and shall have the effect and operation, and be subject to the conditions and provisions as to keeping down interest, which are mentioned in the preceding section.

10. In all cases in which an heir of entail in possession of an estate in Scotland, holden by virtue of a tailzie dated prior to the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, shall have granted or shall grant provision for a lawful child in terms of the Act of the fifth year of the reign of His Majesty King George the Fourth, chapter eighty-seven, and any Acts amending the same, or in virtue of the powers in that behalf contained in the deed of entail of such estate, and such child shall either before or after the passing of this Act pre-decease the grantor of such provision leaving lawful

11. Where any heir of entail in possession of an estate in Scotland, holden by virtue of a tailzie dated prior to the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, shall have executed improvements on such estate, of the nature contemplated by this or any other Entail Act as the case may be, and shall have died after the passing of this Act without having charged the estate with the amount which he is entitled to charge of the sums expended on such improvements, it shall be lawful for any person to whom such heir of entail may have expressly bequeathed, conveyed, or assigned such sums or any part thereof, to make application by summary petition to the court, praying the court after such enquiry as to the court shall seem proper, to find and declare that the sums specified in the petition, or any part thereof have been expended on improvements on the said estate by the deceased heir of entail; and that the petitioner is in right thereof; and to decern and ordain the heir in possession of such entailed estate to execute in favour of the petitioner or of any other person such petitioner may think fit, a bond and disposition in security over the said estate other than the mansion-house, offices, and policies thereof, or over some sufficient portion of the said estate other than as aforesaid, for the amount with which the deceased heir of entail himself might under the provisions of this Act have charged the estate, which bond and disposition in seca-

rity shall contain all clauses proper to be inserted in bonds and dispositions in security which in virtue of this Act may be granted by an heir of entail in possession for sums expended by himself on improvements on his estate; provided always, that the said sums shall only be deemed to be a debt against the entailed estate and the heirs of entail therein, and shall only bear interest from and after the date of the decree of the court pronounced in such petition.

12. Subject to such rules in regard to the matters in this Procedure in section mentioned as the court are hereby authorised and re- ^der^Entail quired to make by act of sederunt, on or before the fifteenth Acts, day of November one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, and thereafter from time to time to vaiy or extend as they shall see fit, the following provisions shall have effect with reference to all applications to the court under this or any other Entail Act:

service, should apply to such appointments on the said establishment:

And whereas it appears that persons have been appointed to junior situations on the said establishment who ought in pursuance of the sixteenth section of the said Act, and the Order in Council and regulations therein referred to, to have obtained previous to their appointment certificates from the Civil Service Commissioners, but through inadvertence on the part of the Secretary of State in Council, and without any default of the persons so appointed, no steps were taken before their appointment to procure for them such certificates:

And whereas it is unjust that the persons so appointed should be deprived of any rewards or advantages which they were led to expect at the time when they entered the said establishment:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queens most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

Any order or warrant made in pursuance of this Act shall Order to be laid be laid before both Houses of Parliament within fourteen days before.Pariia-after the meeting thereof if Parliament be sitting, and if Par- ment' liament be not sitting, then within fourteen days after the next meeting thereof.

The Secretary of State for Iudia in Council shall cause to be laid before. Parliament, not later than the expiration of one month after the commencement of the session in Parliament in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, a return showing the names of all persons with respect to whom any order or warrant has been issued in pursuance of this section, together with the situations to which they have been appointed.

(1.) The office of Chief Judge in Bankruptcy shall be filled £

within the next subsequent forty days on which the said House shall have sat, praying that any such Rule or Order may be annulled, Her Majesty may thereupon by Order in Council annul the same; and the Rule or Order so annulled shall thenceforth become void and of no effect, but without prejudice to the validity of any proceedings which may in the meantime have been taken under the same.

This section shall come into operation immediately on the passing of this Act.

Any order made in pursuance of this section shall be binding on all the courts, offices, and officers to which it refers, in the same manner as if it had been enacted by Parliament.

All such fees and per-centages shall (save as otherwise directed by the order) be paid into the receipt of Her Majesty*s Exchequer and be earned to the Consolidated Fund, and with respect thereto the following rules shall be observed:

(1.) The fees and per-centages shall, except so far as the order may otherwise direct, be taken by stamps, and if not taken by stamps shall be taken, applied, accounted for, and paid over in such manner as may be directed by the order.

(2.) Such stamps shall be impressed or adhesive, as the Treasury from time to time direct.

(3 .; The Treasury, with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor, may from time to time make such rules as may seem fit for publishing the amount of the fees and regulating the use of such stamps, and particularly for prescribing the application thereof to documents from time to time in use or required to be used for the purposes of such stamps, and for insuring the proper cancellation of stamps and for keeping accounts of such stamps.

(4.) Any document which ought to bear a stamp in pursuance of this Act, or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be received, filed, used, or admitted in evidence unless and until it is properly stamped, within the time prescribed by the rules under this section regulating the use of stamps, but if any such document is through mistake or inadvertence received, filed, or used without being properly stamped, the Lord Chancellor or the Court may, if he or it shall think fit, order that the same be stamped as in such order may be directed.

(5.) The Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall keep such separate accounts of all money received in respect of stamps under this Act as the Treasury may from time to time direct, and, subject to the deduction of any expenses incurred by those Commissioners in the execution of this section, the money so received shall, under the direction of the Treasury, be carried to and form part of the Consolidated Fund.

1875. Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) Amt Ch. 77.

An order under this section may abolish any existing fees and per-centages which may be taken in the said courts or offices, or any of them, or by the said officers or any of them, but, subject to the provisions of any order made in pursuance of this section, the existing fees and per-centages shall continue to be taken, applied, and accounted for in the existing manner.

27. Whereas by the Common Pleas at Lancaster Amendment Act, 1869, the fees taken by the prothonotaries and district prothonotaries in pursuance of that Act, are directed to be carried to the credit of "the prothonotaries fee fund 44 account of the county palatine of Lancaster," and certain salaries and expenses connected with the offices of the said prothonotaries and district prothonotaries are directed to be paid out of that account:

And whereas, on the twenty-fourth day of June one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, there was standing to the credit of that account a sum of ten thousand seven hundred and fifty-five pounds consolidated three pounds, per centum Bank annuities and one thousand eight hundred and ten pounds cash, or thereabouts:

And whereas the fees received in the Court of Pleas of Durham are applied in payment of disbursements connected with the office of the prothonotary of that court, and any surplus of such fees is paid into the receipt of Her Majesty's Exchequer, and any deficiency of the amount of the said fees to pay such disbursements is charged on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom.

And whereas after the commencement of the principal Act, the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas at Lancaster and the Court of Pleas at Durham is by that Act transferred to and vested in the High Court of Justice, and it is expedient to make further provision respecting the expenses of those courts and the said stock and cash standing to the credit of the prothonotaries fee fund account of the county palatine of Lancaster:

Be it therefore enacted that,—

After the commencement of the principal Act there shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament such sums by way of salary or remuneration to the prothonotaries and district prothonotaries of the Court of Common Pleas at Lancaster and the Court of Common Pleas at Durham and their clerks, and such suras for rent, taxes, and other outgoings at their offices, as the Lord Chancellor, with the concurrence of the Treasury, may from time to time direct.

As soon as each prothonotary and district prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas at Lancaster has accounted for and paid all fees and moneys which he shall have received by virtue of his said office, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster shall cause any security given by such officer in pur-

suance of section seventeen of the Common Fleas at Lancaster Amendment Act, 1869, to be cancelled, and delivered up, or otherwise discharged.

As soon as may be after the commencement of the principal Act the Treasury and the Chancellor of the duchy and county palatine of Lancaster shall ascertain the amount of stock and cash standing to the credit of the prothonotaries fee fund account of the county palatine of Lancaster, after paying thereout to the receiver general of the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster the amount of the fees remaining in the pro-thonotary's hands on the twenty-fourth day of October one thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine, and paid to that account in pursuance of section seventeen of the last-mentioned Act, and all other sums justly due to Her Majesty in right of Her said duchy and county palatine; and the Treasury shall by warrant direct the Governor and Company of the Bank of England to transfer to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt the amount of stock and cash so ascertained and either to cancel the stock in their books or otherwise dispose of the same as may be directed by the warrant; and the Governor and Company of the Bank of England shall transfer the stock and cash, and cancel or otherwise dispose of the stock according to the warrant, without any order from the Lord Chancellor or the Chancellor of the said duchy and county palatine or any other person.

The Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt shall apply all cash transferred to them in pursuance of this section in the purchase of Bank Annuities which shall be cancelled or otherwise disposed of in like manner as the said stock.

28* The Treasury shall cause to be prepared annually an account for the year ending the thirty-first day of March, showing the receipts and expenditure during the preceding year in respect of the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal, and of any court, office, or officer, the fees taken in which or by whom can be fixed in pursuance of this Act.

Such account shall be made out in such form and contain such particulars as the Treasury, with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor, may from time to time direct.

Every officer by whom or in whose office fees are taken which can be fixed in pursuance of this Act, shall make such returns and give such information as the Treasury may from time to time require for the purpose of enabling them to make out the said account.

The said account shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within one month after the thirty-first day of March in each year, if Parliament is then sitting, or if not, then within one month after the next meeting of Parliament.

Queen's coroner and attorney, and out of such moneys there puiane Judge is paid in pursuance of a writ of privy seal an'annual sum of forty pounds, at the rate of ten pounds for every term, to the Queen's second judge of the Court of Queen's Bench, and by section coroner, seven of the Act of the sixth year of King George the Fourth, chapter eighty-four, it is enacted that the said terrnly allowance of ten pounds shall continue to be paid to the said second judge in addition to his salary:

And whereas out of the said moneys there is also payable in pursuance of the said writ of privy seal an annual sum of ten pounds to the Queen's coroner and attorney:

And whereas it is expedient to determine such payments:

Be it therefore enacted as follows:

After the passing of this Act the said sums of forty pounds and ten pounds a year shall cease to be payable by the Queen's coroner and attorney out of the above-mentioned moneys.

So long as the person who on the first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five was the second judge of the Court of Queen's Bench continues to be such second judge, there shall be payable to him out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom the annual sum of forty pounds in addition to his salary, and that annual sum shall be payable to him by instalments of ten pounds at the like times at which the said terrnly allowance of ten pounds has heretofore been payable to him, or at such other times as the Treasury, with the consent of the Judge, may direct.

So long as the person who on the first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five was the Queen's coroner and attorney continues to hold that office, there shall be payable to him out of moneys provided by Parliament the annual sura of ten pounds, and such sum shall be payable to him at the like time at which the said annual sum of ten pounds has heretofore been payable to him, or at such other time as the Treasury, with the consent of such Queen's coroner or attorney, may direct.

30. Whereas by section sixteen of " The Court of Chancery Funds Act, 1872," it is enacted that an order of the Court of Chancery may direct securities standing to the account of the Paymaster General on behalf of the Court of Chancery to be converted into cash, and that where such order refers to Government securities such securities shall be transferred to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt in manner therein mentioned:

And whereas the said section contains no provision for the converse cases of the conversion of cash into securities and the transfer of securities from the said Commissioners to the account of the Paymaster General on behalf of the Court of Chancery:

provided for by rules made in pursuance of section eighteen of the said Act; and it is expedient to remove doubts with respect to the power to provide by such rules for the investment in securities of money in court, and the conversion into money of securities in court:

Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Section sixteen of "The Court of Chancery Funds Act, 1872," is hereby repealed.

Rules may from time to time be made in pursuance of section eighteen of " The Court of Chancery Funds Act, 1872," with respect to the investment in securities of money in court, and the conversion into money of securities in court, and with respect to the transfer to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt of Government securities ordered by the Court to be sold or converted into cash, and to the transfer by those Commissioners to the Paymaster General for the time being, on behalf of the Court of Chancery, of Government securities ordered by the Court of Chancery to be purchased.

This section shall come into operation on the passing of this Act, and shall be construed together with " The Court " of Chancery Funds Act, 1872," and shall be subject to any alteration in that Act made by or in pursuance of the principal Act or this Act.

After the passing of this Act there shall cease to be a secretary to the visitors of lunatics.

The Treasury shall award, out of moneys provided by Parliament, to the person who holds at the passing of this Act the office of secretary to the visitors of lunatics such compensation, by way of annuity or otherwise, as, having regard to the conditions on which he was appointed to his office, the nature, salary, and emoluments of his office, and the duration of his services, they may think just and reasonable, so that the same be granted in accordance with the provisions and subject to the conditions contained in the Superannuation Act, 1859.

" direct that the sum so vested shall be repaid out of moneys " provided by Parliament, and shall be distributed as it would 4t have been if there had been no such vesting

And whereas a similar enactment with respect to unclaimed dividends in bankruptcy was made by section one hundred and sixteen of " The Bankruptcy Act, 186982 & 33 Vict And whereas it is expedient to give to persons entitled to c* 71* any such unclaimed dividends or other sums greater facilities for obtaining the same: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Any Court having jurisdiction in the matter of any bankruptcy or insolvency, upon being satisfied that any person claiming is entitled to any dividend or other payment out of the moneys vested in the Crown in pursuance of section nineteen of " The Bankruptcy Repeal and Insolvent Court Act, 32 & 33 Vict. 1869," or of section one hundred and sixteen of " The Bank- cc- 83>71-" ruptcy Act, 1869," may order payment of the same in like manner as it might have done if the same had not by reason of the expiration of five years become vested in the Crown in pursuance of the said sections.

2. The application by the plaintiff for leave to enter final judgment under the last preceding Rule shall be made by summons returnable not less than two clear days after service.

3. The defendant may show cause against such application by offering to bring into Court the sum indorsed on the writ, or by affidavit.

1875. Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) Ami. Ch. 77.

admitted to be due, subject to such terms, if any, as to suspending execution, or the payment of the amount levied or any part thereof into Court by the sheriff, the taxation of costs, or otherwise, as the Judge may think fit.

792

Ch.77. SupremeCt.of JudicatureAct(l873)Ami, 38&39Vict.

4. It shall not be necessary that every defendant to any action shall be interested as to all the relief thereby prayed for, or as to every cause of action included therein; but the Court or a Judge may make such order as may appear just to prevent any defendant from being embarrassed or put to expense by being required to attend any proceedings in such action in which he may have no interest.

5. The plaintiff may, at his option, join as parties to the same action all or any of the persons severally, or jointly and severally, liable on any one contract, including parties to bills of exchange and promissory notes.

6. Where in any action, whether founded upon contract or otherwise, the plaintiff is in doubt as to the person from whom he is entitled to redress, he may, in such manner as herein-after mentioned, or as may be prescribed by any special order, join two or more defendants, to the intent that in such action the question as to which, if any, of the defendants is liable, and to what extent, may be determined as between all parties to the action.

7. Trustees, executors, and administrators may sue and be sued on behalf of or as representing the property or estate of which they are trustees or representatives, without joining any of the parties beneficially interested in the trust or estate, and shall be considered as representing such parties in the action; but the Court or a Judge may, at any stage of the proceedings, order any of such parties to be made parties to the action, either in addition to or in lieu of the previously existing parties thereto.

8. Married women and infants may respectively sue as plaintiffs by their next friends, in the manner practised in the Court of Chancery before the passing of this Act; and infants may, in like manner, defend any action by their guardians appointed for that purpose.

9. Where there are numerous parties having the same interest in one action, one or more of such parties may sue or be sued, or may be authorised by the Court to defend in such action, on behalf or for the benefit of all parties so interested.

10. Any two or more persons claiming or being liable as copartners may sue or be sued in the name of their respective firms, if any; and any party to an action may in such case apply by summons to a Judge for a statement of the names of the persons who are co-partners in any such firm, to be furnished in such manner, and verified on oath or otherwise, as the Judge may direct.

11. Subject to the provisions of the Act, and these Rules, the provisions as to parties, contained in section 42 of* 15 & 16 Victoria, chapter 86, shall be in force as to actions in the High Court of Justice.

12. Subject as last aforesaid, in all Probate actions the rules as to parties, heretofore in use in the Court of Probate, shall continue to be in force.

13. No action shall be defeated by reason of the mis-joinder of parties, and the Court may in every action deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interests of the parties actually before it. The Court or a Judge may, at any stage of the proceedings, either upon or without the application of either party,

1875. Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) Amt Ch. 77.

and on such terms as may appear to the Court or a Judge to be just, order that the name or names of any party or parties, whether as plaintiffs or as defendants, improperly joined be struck out, and that the name or names of any party or parties, whether plaintiffs or defendants, who ought to have been joined, or whose presence before the Court may be necessary in order to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the action, bo added. No person shall be added as a plaintiff suing without a next friend, or as the next friend of a plaintiff under any disability, without his own consent thereto. All parties whose names are so added as defendants shall be served with a summons or notice in manner herein-after mentioned, or in such manner as may be prescribed by any special order, and the proceedings as against them shall be deemed to have begun only on the service of such summons or notice.

If a statement of claim has been delivered previously to such defendant being added, the same shall, unless otherwise ordered by the Court or Judge, be amended in such manner as the making such new defendant a party shall render desirable, and a copy of such amended statement of claim shall be delivered to such new defendant at the time when he is served with the writ of summons or notice or afterwards, within four days after his appearance.

17. Where a defendant is or claims to be entitled to contribution or indemnity, or any other remedy or relief over against any other person, or where from any other cause it appears to the Court or a Judge that a question in the action should be determined not only as between the plaintiff and defendant, but as between the plaintiff, defendant, and any other person, or between any or either of them, the Court or a Judge may on notice being given to such last-mentioned person, make such order as may be proper for having the question so determined.

18. Where a defendant claims to be entitled to contribution, indemnity, or other remedy or relief over against any person not a party to the action, he may, by leave of the Court or a Judge, issue a notice to that effect, stamped with the seal with which writs of summons are sealed. A copy of such notice shall be filed with the proper officer and served on such person according to the rules relating to the service of writs of summons. The notice shall state the nature and grounds of the claim, and shall, unless otherwise ordered by the Court or a Judge, be served within the time limited for delivering his statement of defence. Such notice may be in the form or to the effect of the Form No. 1 in Appendix (B) hereto with such variations as circumstances may require, and therewith shall be served a copy of the statement of claim, or if there be no statement of claim, then a copy of the writ of summons in the action.

19. When under Rule 17 of this Order it is made to appear to the Court or a Judge at any time before or at the trial that a question

794

Ch.77. Supreme Ct. of Judicature Act (1&73) Amt. 38&39Vict.

in the action should be determined, not only as between the plaintiff and defendant, but as between the plaintiff and the defendant and any other person, or between any or either of them, the Court or a Judge, before or at the time of making the order for having such question determined, shall direct such notice to be given by the plaintiff at such time and to such person and in such manner as may be thought proper, and if made at the trial the Judge may postpone such trial as he may think fit.

20. If a person not a party to the action, who is served as mentioned in Rule 18, desires to dispute the plaintiff's claim in the action as against the defendant on whose behalf the notice has been given, he must enter an appearance in the action within eight days from the service of the notice. In default of his so doing, he shall be deemed to admit the validity of the judgment obtained against such defendant, whether obtained by consent or otherwise. Provided always, that a person so served and failing to appear within the said period of eight days may apply to the Court or a Judge for leave to appear, and such leave may be given upon such terms, if any, as the Court or a Judge shall think fit.

21. If a person not a party to the action served under these Rules appears pursuant to the notice, the party giving the notice may apply to the Court or a Judge for directions as to the mode of having the question in the action determined; and the Court or Judge, upon the hearing of such application, may, if it shall appear desirable so to do, give the person so served liberty to defend the action upon such terms as shall seem just, and may direct such pleadings to be delivered, or such amendments in any pleadings to be made, and generally may direct such proceedings to be taken, and give such directions as to the Court or a Judge shall appear proper for having the question most conveniently determined, and as to the mode and extent in or to which the person so served shall be bound or made liable by the decision of the question.

ORDER XVII.

Joinder of Causes of Action.

1. Subject to the following Rules, the plaintiff may unite in the same action and in the same statement of claim several causes of action, but if it appear to the Court or a Judge that any such causes of action cannot be conveniently tried or disposed of together, the Court or Judge may order separate trials of any of such causes of action to be had, or may make such other order as may be necessary or expedient for the separate disposal thereof.

2. No cause of action shall unless by leave of the Court or a Judge be joined with an action for the recovery of land, except claims in respect of mesne profits or arrears of rent in respect'of the premises claimed, or any part thereof, and damages for breach of any contract under which the same or any part thereof are held.

8. Claims by a trustee in bankruptcy as such shall not, unless by leave of the Court or a Judg$, be joined with any claim by him in any other capacity.

4. Claims by or against husband and wife may be joined with elaims by or against either of them separately.

5. Claims by or against an executor or administrator as suchrmay be joined with claims by or against him personally, provided the last-mentioned claims are alleged to arise with reference to the estate

795

1875. Swpreme Cov/rt of Judicature Act (1873) Ch.77.

in respect of which the plaintiff or defendant sues or is sued as executor or administrator.

6. Claims by plaintiffs jointly may be joined with claims by them or any of them separately against the same defendant.

7. The last three preceding Rules shall be subject to Rule 1 of this Order, and to the Rules herein-after contained.

8. Any defendant alleging that the plaintiff has united in the same action several causes of action which cannot be conveniently disposed of in one action, may at any time apply to the Court or a Judge for an order confining the action to such of the causes of action as may be conveniently disposed of in one proceeding.

9. If, on the hearing of such application as in the last preceding Rule mentioned, it shall appear to the Court or a Judge that the causes of action are such as cannot all be conveniently disposed of in one action, the Court or a Judge may order any of such causes of action to be excluded, and may direot the statement of claim, or, if no statement of claim has been delivered, the copy of the writ of summons, and the indorsement of claim on the writ of summons, to be amended accordingly, and may make such order as to costs as may be just.

ORDER XVIII.

Actions by and against Lunatics and Persons of unsound

Mind.

In all cases in which lunatics and persons of unsound mind not so found by inquisition might respectively before the passing of the Act have sued as plaintiffs or would have been liable to be sued as defendants in any action or suit, they may respectively sue as plaintiffs in any action by their committee or next friend in manner practised in the Court of Chancery before the passing of the said Act, and may in like manner defend any action by their committees or guardians appointed for that purpose.

ORDER XIX.

Pleading Generally.

1. The following rales of pleading shall be substituted for those heretofore used in the High Court of Chancery and in the Courts of Common Law, Admiralty, and Probate.

2. Unless the defendant in an action at the time of his appearance shall state that he does not require the delivery of a statement of complaint, the plaintiff shall within such time and in such manner as herein-after prescribed, deliver to the defendant after his appearance a statement of his complaint and of the relief or remedy to which he claims to be entitled. The defendant shall within such time and in such maimer as herein-after prescribed deliver to the plaintiff a statement of his defence, set-off, or counter-claim (if any), and the plaintiff shall in like manner deliver a statement of his reply (if any) to such defence, set-off, or counter-claim. Such statements shall be as brief as the nature of the case will admit, and the Court in adjusting the costs of the action shall inquire at the instance of any party into any unnecessary prolixity, and order the costs occasioned by auch prolixity to be borne by the party chargeable with the same.

3. A defendant in an action may set-off, or set up, by way of counter-claim against the claims of the plaintiff, any right or claim, whether such set-off or counter-claim sound in damages or not, and

796

Ch.77. Supi'eme Ot. of Judicature Act(187S) Amt. 38&39Vict.

such set-off or counter-claim shall have the same effect as a statement of claim in a cross action, so as to enable the Court to pronounce a final judgment in the same action, both on the original and on the cross claim. But the Court or a Judge may, on the application of the plaintiff before trial, if in the opinion of the Court or Judge such set-off or counter-claim cannot be conveniently disposed of in the pending action, or ought not to be allowed, refuse permission to the defendant to avail himself thereof.

4. Every pleading shall contain as concisely as may be a statement of the material facts on which the party pleading relies, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved, such statement being divided into paragraphs, numbered consecutively, and each paragraph containing, as nearly as may be, a separate allegation. Dates, sums, and numbers shall be expressed in figures and not in words. Signature of counsel shall not be necessary. Forms similar to those in Appendix (C.) hereto may be used.

5. Every pleading which shall contain less than three folios of 72 words each (every figure being counted as one word) may be either printed or written, or partly printed and partly written, and every other pleading, not being a petition or summons, shall be printed.

6. Every pleading or other document required to be delivered to a party, or between parties, shall be delivered in the manner now in use to the solicitor of every party who appears by a solicitor, or to the party if he does not appear by a solicitor, but if no appearance has been entered for any party, then such pleading or document shall be delivered by being filed with the proper officer.

7. Every pleading in an action shall be delivered between parties, and shall be marked on the face with the date of the day on which it is delivered, and with the reference to the letter and number of the action, the Division to which and the Judge (if any) to whom the action is assigned, the title of the action, the description of the pleading, and the name and place of business of the solicitor and agent, if any, delivering the same, or the name and address of the party delivering the same if he does not act by a solicitor.

8. Every statement of claim shall state specifically the relief which the plaintiff claims, either simply or in the alternative, and may also ask for general relief. And the same rule shall apply to any counterclaim made, or relief claimed by the defendant, in his statement of defence. If the plaintiff's claim be for discovery only the statement of claim shall show it.

9. Where the plaintiff seeks relief in respect of several distinct claims or causes of complaint founded upon separate and distinct facts, they shall be stated, as far as may be, separately and distinctly. And the same rule shall apply where the defendant relies upon several distinct grounds of defence, set-off, or counter-claim founded upon separate and distinct facts.

10. Where any defendant seeks to rely upon any facts as supporting a right of set-off or counter-claim, he shall, in his statement of defence, state specifically that he does so by way of set-off or counter-claim.

11. If either party wishes to deny the right of any other party to claim as executor, or as trustee whether in bankruptcy or otherwise, or in any representative or other alleged capacity, or the alleged constitution of any partnership firm, he shall deny the same specifically.

1875. Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) Amt. Ch.77.

12. In Probate actions where the plaintiff disputes the interest of the defendant, he shall allege in his statement of claim that he denies the defendant's interest.

13. No plea or defence shall be pleaded in abatement.

14. No new assignment shall hereafter be necessary or used. But everything which has heretofore been alleged by way of new assignment may hereafter be introduced by amendment of the statement

' of claim.

15. No defendant in an action for the recovery of land who is in possession by himself or his tenant need plead his title, unless his defence depends on an equitable estate or right or he claims relief upon any equitable ground against any right or title asserted by the plaintiff. But, except in the cases herein-before mentioned, it shall be sufficient to state by way of defence that he is so in possession. And he may neviertheless rely upon any ground of defence which he can prove, except as herein-before mentioned.

16. Nothing in these Rules contained shall affect the right of any defendant to plead not guilty by statute. And every defence of not guilty by statute shall have the same effect as a plea of not guilty by statute has heretofore had. But if the defendant so plead he shall not plead any other defence without the leave of the Court or a Judge.

17. Every allegation of fact in any pleading in an action, not being a petition or summons, if not denied specifically or by necessary implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the opposite party, shall be taken to be admitted, except as against an infant, lunatic, or person of unsound mind not so found by inquisition.

18. Each party in any pleading, not being a petition or summons, must allege all such facts not appearing in the previous pleadings as be means to rely on, and must raise all such grounds of defence or reply, as the case may be, as if not raised on the pleadings would be likely to take the opposite party by surprise, or would raise new issues of fact not arising out of the pleadings, as for instance, fraud, or that any claim has been barred by the Statute of Limitations or has been released.

19. No pleading, not being a petition or summons, shall, except by way of amendment, raise any new ground of claim or contain any allegation of fact inconsistent with the previous pleadings of the party pleading the same.

20. It shall not be sufficient for a defendant in his defence to deny generally the facts alleged by the statement of claim, or for a plaintiff in his reply to deny generally the facts alleged in a defence by way of counter-claim, but each party must deal specifically with each allegation of fact of which he does not admit the truth.

21. Subject to the last preceding Rule, the plaintiff by his reply may join issue upon the defence, and each party in his pleading, if any, subsequent to reply, may join issue upon the previous pleading. Such joinder of issue shall operate as a denial of every material allegation of fact in the pleading upon which issue is joined, but it may except any facts which to the party may be willing to admit, and shall then operate as a denial of the facts not so admitted.

22. When a party in any pleading denies an allegation of fact in the previous pleading of the opposite party, he must not do so evasively, but answer the point of substance. Thus, if it be alleged that he received a certain sum of money, it shall not be sufficient to deny that he received that particular amount, but he must deny that he

798

Ch.77. Supreme Gt. of Judicature Act (1873) Amt. 38&S9 Vict.

received that sum or any part thereof, or else set out how much he received. And so when a matter of fact is alleged with divers circumstances, it shall not be sufficient to deny it as alleged along with those circumstances, but a fair and substantial answer must be given.

23. When a contract is alleged in any pleading, a bare denial of the contract by the opposite party shall be construed only as a denial of the making of the contract in fact, and not of its legality or its sufficiency in law, whether with reference to the Statute of Frauds or otherwise.

24. Wherever the contents of any document are material, it shall be sufficient in any pleading to state the effect thereof as briefly as possible, without setting out the whole or any part thereof unless the precise words of the document or any part thereof are material.

25. Wherever it is material to allege malice, fraudulent intention, knowledge, or other condition of the mind of any person, it shall be sufficient to allege the same as a fact without setting out the circumstances from which the same is to be inferred.

26. Wherever it is material to allege notice to any person of any fact, matter, or thing, it shall be sufficient to allege such notice as a fact, unless the form or the precise terms of such notice be material.

27. Wherever any contract or any relation between any persons does not arise from an express agreement, but is to be implied from a series of letters or conversations, or otherwise from a number, of circumstances, it shall be sufficient to allege such contract or relation as a fact, and to refer generally to such letters, conversations, or circumstances without setting them out in detail. And if in such case the person so pleading desires to rely in the alternative upon more contracts or relations than one as to be implied from such circumstances, he may state the same in the alternative.

28. Neither party need in any pleading allege any matter of fact which the law presumes in his favour or as to which the burden of proof lies upon the other side, unless the same has first been spec)' fically denied.

[E g.—Consideration for a bill of exchange where the plaintiff sues only on the bill, and not for the consideration as a substantive ground of claim.]

29. Where an action proceeds in a district registry all pleadings and other documents required to be filed shall be filed in the district registry.

30. In actions for damage by collision between vessels, unless the Court or a Judge shall otherwise order, each solicitor shall, before any pleading is delivered, file with the proper officer a document to be called a Preliminary Act, which shall be sealed up and shall not be opened until ordered by the Court or a Judge, and which shall contain a statement of the following particulars:—

(a.) The names of the vessels which came into collision and the names of their masters.

(b.) The time of the collision.

(c.) The place of the collision.

(d.) The direction of the wind.

(e.) The state of the weather.

(yi) The state and force of the tide.

(gr.) The course and speed of the vessel when the other was first seen.

(A) The lights, if any, carried by her.

(*.) The distance and bearing of the other vessel when first seen.

1875. Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) Amt. Ch. 77.

799

(k.) The lights, if any, of the other vessel which were first seen.

(/.) Whether any lights of the other vessel, other than those first seen, came into view before the collision.

(m.) What measures were taken, and when, to avoid the collision.

(n.) The parts of each vessel which first came into contact.

If both solicitors consent, the Court or a Judge may order the preliminary acts to be opened and the evidence to be taken thereon without its being necessary to deliver any pleadings.

ORDER XX.

Pleading Mattebs arising pending the Action.

And if, after a statement of defence has been delivered, any ground of defence arises to any set-off or counter-claim alleged therein by the defendant, it may be pleaded by the plaintiff in his reply, either alone or together with any other ground of reply.

2. Where any ground of defence arises after the defendant has delivered a statement of defence, or after the time limited for his doing so has expired, the defendant may, and where any ground of defence to any set-off or counter-claim arises after reply, or after the time limited for delivering a reply has expired, the plaintiff may, within eight days after such ground of defence has arisen, and by leave of the Court or a Judge, deliver a further defence or further reply, as the case may be, setting forth the same.

3. Whenever any defendant, in his statement of defence, or in any further statement of defence as in the last Rule mentioned, alleges any ground of defence which has arisen after the commencement of the action, the plaintiff may deliver a confession of such defence, which confession may be in the Form No. 2 in Appendix (B.) hereto, with such variations as circumstances may require, and he may thereupon sign judgment for his costs up to the time of the pleading of such defence unless the Court or a Judge shall, either before or after the delivery of such confession, otherwise order.

(5.) The plaintiff may, if he think fit, at any time after the issue of the writ of summons, deliver a statement of claim, with the writ of summons or notice in lieu of writ of summons, or at any time afterwards, either before or after appearance, and although the defendant may have appeared and stated that he does not require the delivery of a statement of claim: Provided that in no case where a defendant has appeared shall a statement be delivered more than six weeks after

the appearance has been entered unless otherwise ordered bj the Court or a Judge.

(c.) Where a plaintiff delivers a statement of claim without being required to do so, the Court or a Judge may make such order as to the costs occasioned thereby as shall seem just, if it appears that the delivery of a statement of claim was unnecessary or improper.

4. Where the writ is specially indorsed, and the defendant has not dispensed with a statement of claim, it shall be sufficient for the plaintiff to deliver as his statement of claim a notice to the effect that his claim is that which appears by the indorsement upon the writ, unless the Court or a Judge shall order him to deliver a further statement. Such notice may be either written or printed or partly written and partly printed, and may be in the Form No. 3 in Appendix (B.) hereto, and shall be marked on the face in the same manner as is required in the case of an ordinary statement of claim. And when the plaintiff is ordered to deliver such further statement it shall be delivered within such time as by such order shall be directed, and if no time be so limited then within the time prescribed by Rule 1 of this Order.

ORDER XXII.

10. Where in any action a set-off or counter-claim is established as a defence against the plaintiff's claim, the Court may, if the balance is in favour of the defendant, give judgment for the defendant for such balance, or may otherwise adjudge to the defendant such relief as he may be entitled to upon the merits of the case.

11. In Probate actions the .party opposing a will may, with his defence, give notice to the party setting up the will that he merely insists upon the will being proved in solemn form of law, and only intends to cross-examine the witnesses produced in support of the will, and he shall thereupon be at liberty to do so, and shall be subject to the same liabilities in respect of costs as he would have been under similar circumstances according to the practice of the Court of Probate.

ORDER XXIII.

claim at any time before the expiration of the time allowed him for pleading to the reply, and before pleading thereto, or in case there be no reply, then at any time before the expiration of twenty-eight days from the filing of his defence.

4. Where any party has amended his pleading under either of the last two preceding Rules, the opposite party may, within eight days after the delivery to him of the amended pleading, apply to the Court, or a Judge, to disallow the amendment, or any part thereof, and the Court or Judge may, if satisfied that the justice of the case requires it, disallow the same, or allow it subject to such terms as to costs or otherwise as may seem just.

6. Where any party has amended his pleading under Rule 2 or 3 of this Order, the other party may apply to the Court or a Judge for leave to plead or amend his former pleading within such time and upon such terms as may seem just.

8. A pleading may be amended by written alterations in the pleading which has been delivered, and by additions on paper to be interleaved therewith if necessary, unless the amendments require the insertion of more than 144 words in any one place, or are so numerous or of such a nature that the making them in writing would render the pleading difficult or inconvenient to read, in either of which cases the amendment must be made by delivering a print of the pleading as amended.

9. Whenever any pleading is amended, such pleading when amended shall be marked with the date of the order, if any, under which the same is so amended, and of the day on which such amendment is made, in manner following, viz .: " Amended

Demurrer.

1. Any party may demur to any pleading of the opposite party, or to any part of a pleading setting up a distinct cause of action, ground of defence, set-off, counter-claim, reply, or as the case may be, on the ground that the facts alleged therein do not show any cause of action, or ground of defence to a claim or any part thereof, or set-off, or oouater-daha, or reply, or as the case may be, to which effect can be given by the Court as against the party demurring.

:2. A demurrer shall state specifically whether it is to the whole or to a part, and if so, to what part, of the pleading of the opposite

3 H 2

804

Ch.77. SupremeCt.ofJudicature Act (1873) Amt 38 & 39 Vic t,

party. It shall state some ground in law for the demurrer, but the party demurring shall not, on the argument of the demurrer, be limited to the ground so stated. A demurrer may be in the Form 28 in Appendix (C.) hereto. If there is no ground, or only a frivoloua ground of demurrer stated, the Court or Judge may set aside such demurrer, with costs.

3. A demurrer shall be delivered in the same manner and within the same time as any other pleading in the action.

4. A defendant desiring to demur to part of a statement of claim, and to put in a defence to the other part, shall combine such demurrer and defence in one pleading. And so in every case where a party entitled to put in a further pleading desires to demur to part of the last pleading of the opposite party he shall combine such demurrer and other pleading.

5. If the party demurring desires to be at liberty to plead as well as demur to the matter demurred to, he may, before demurring, apply to the Court or a Judge for an order giving him leave to do so; and the Court or Judge, if satisfied that there is reasonable ground for the demurrer, may make an order accordingly, or may reserve leave to him to plead after the demurrer is overruled, or may make such other order and upon such terms as may be just.

6. When a demurrer either to the whole or part of a pleading is delivered, either party may enter the demurrer for argument immediately, and the party so entering such demurrer shall on the same day give notice thereof to the other party. If the demurrer shall not be entered and notice thereof given within ten days after delivery, and if the party whose pleading is demurred to does not within such time serve an order for leave to amend, the demurrer shall be held sufficient for the same purposes and with the same result as to costs as if it had been allowed on argument.

7. While a demurrer to the whole or any part of a pleading is pending, such pleading shall not be amended, unless by order of the Court or a Judge; and no such order shall be made except on payment of the costs of the demurrer.

10. Where a demurrer to any pleading or part of a pleading is allowed in any case not falling within the last preceding Rule, then (subject to the power of the Court to allow an amendment) the matter demurred to shall as between the parties to the demurrer be deemed to be struck out of the pleadings, and the rights of the parties shall be the same as if it had not been pleaded.

11. Where a demurrer is overruled the demurring party shall pay to the opposite party the costs occasioned by the demurrer, unless the Court shall otherwise direct.

Default of Pleading.

1. If the plaintiff, being bound to deliver a statement of claim, does not deliver the same within the time allowed for that purpose, the defendant may, at the expiration of that time, apply to the Court or a Judge to dismiss the action with costs, for want of prosecution; and on the hearing of such application the Court or Judge may, if no statement of claim have been delivered, order the action to be dismissed accordingly, or may make such other order on such terms as to the Court or Judge shall seem just.

2. If the plaintiff's claim be only for a debt or liquidated demand, and the defendant does not, within the time allowed for that purpose, deliver a defence or demurrer, the plaintiff may, at the expiration of su<Jh time, enter final judgment for the amount claimed, with costs.

3. When in any such action as in the last preceding Rule mentioned there are several defendants, if one of them make default as mentioned in the last preceding Rule, the plaintiff may enter final judgment against the defendant so making default, and issue execution upon such judgment without prejudice to his right to proceed with his action against the other defendants.

4. If the plaintiff's claim be for detention of goods and pecuniary damages, or either of them, and the defendant makes default as mentioned in Rule 2, the plaintiff may enter an interlocutory judgment against the defendant, and a writ of inquiry shall issue to assess the value of the goods, and the damages, or the damages only, as the case may be. But the Court or a Judge may order that, instead of a writ of inquiry, the value and amount of damages, or either of them, shall be ascertained in any way in which any question arising in an action may be tried.

5. When in any such action as in Rule 4 mentioned there are several defendants, if one of them make default as mentioned in Rule 2, the plaintiff may enter an interlocutory judgment against the defendant so making default, and proceed with his action against the others. And in such case, damages against the defendant making default shall be assessed at the same time with the trial of the action or issues therein against the other defendants, unless the Court or a Judge shall otherwise direct.

6. If the plaintiff's claim be for a debt or liquidated demand, and also for detention of goods and pecuniary damages, or pecuniary damages only, and the defendant makes default as mentioned in Rule 2, the plaintiff may enter final judgment for the debt or liquidated demand, and also enter interlocutory judgment for the value of the goods and the damages, or the damages only, as the case may be, and proceed as mentioned in Rule 4.

7. In an action for the recovery of land, if the defendant makes default as mentioned in Rule 2, the plaintiff may enter a judgment that the person whose title is asserted in the writ of summons shall recover possession of the land, with his costs.

8. WTiere the plaintiff has endorsed a claim for mesne profits, arrears of rent, or damages for breach of contract upon a writ for the recovery of land, if the defendant makes default as mentioned in

806

Rule 2, or if there be more than one defendant, some or one of the defendants make such default, the plaintiff may enter judgment against the defaulting defendant or defendants and proceed as mentioned in Rules 4 and 5.

9. In Probate actions, if any defendant make default in filing and delivering a defence or demurrer, the action may proceed, notwithstanding such default.

10. In all other actions than those in the preceding Rules of this Order mentioned, if the defendant makes default in delivering a defence or demurrer, the plaintiff may set down the action on motion for judgment, and such judgment shall be given as upon the statement of claim the Court shall consider the plaintiff to be entitled to.

11. Where, in any such action as mentioned in the last preceding Rule, there are several defendants, then, if one of such defendants make such default as aforesaid, the plaintiff may either set down the action at once on motion for judgment against the defendant so making default, or may set it down against him at the time when it is entered for trial or set down on motion for judgment against the other defendants.

12. If the plaintiff does not deliver a reply or demurrer, or any party does not deliver any subsequent pleading, or a demurrer, within the period allowed for that purpose, the pleadings shall be deemed to be closed at the expiration of that period, and the statements of fact in the pleading last delivered shall be deemed to be admitted.

13. In any case in which issues arise in an action other than between plaintiff and defendant, if any party to any such issue makes default in delivering any pleading, the opposite party may apply to the Court or a Judge for such judgment, if any, as upon the pleadings he may appear to be entitled to. And the Court may order judgment to be entered accordingly, or may make such other order as may be necessary to do complete justice between the parties.

14. Any judgment by default, whether under this Order or under any other of these Rules, may be set aside by the Court or a Judge, upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as such Court or Judge may think fit.

Where any action is brought to recover a debt or damages, any defendant may at any time after service of the writ, and before or at the time of delivering his defence, or by leave of the Court or a Judge at any later time, pay into Court a sum of money by way of satisfaction or amends. Payment into Court shall be pleaded in the defence, and the claim or cause of action in respect of which such payment shall be made shall be specified therein.

2. Such sum of money shall be paid to the proper officer, who shall give a receipt for the same.

3. Money paid into Court as aforesaid may, unless otherwise ordered by a Judge, be paid out to the plaintiff, or to his solicitor on the written authority of the plaintiff.

5. Any party called upon to answer interrogatories, whether by himself or by any member or officer, may, within four days after service of the interrogatories, apply at chambers to strike out any interrogatory, on the ground that it is scandalous or irrelevant, or is not put bond fide for the purposes of the action, or that the matter inquired after is not sufficiently material at that stage of the action, or on any other ground. And the Judge, if satisfied that any interrogatory is objectionable, may order it to be struck out.

10. If any person interrogated omits to answer, or answers insufficiently, the party interrogating may apply to the Court or a Judge for an order requiring him to answer, or to answer further, as the case may be. And an order may be made requiring him to answer or answer further either by affidavit or by vivfi voce examination, as the Judge may direct.

11. It shall be lawful for the Court or a Judge at any time during the pendency therein of any action or proceeding, to order the production by any party thereto, upon oath, of such of the documents in his possession or power, relating to any matter in question in such action or proceeding, as the Court or Judge shall think right; mid the Court may deal with such documents, when produced, in such manner as shall appear just.

19. If the party from whom discovery of any kind or inspection is sought objects to the same, or any part thereof, the Court or a Judge may, if satisfied that the right to the discovery or inspection sought depends on the determination of any issue or question in dispute in the action, or that for any other reason it is desirable that any issue or question in dispute in the action should be determined before deciding upon the right to the discovery or inspection, order that such issue or question be determined first, and reserve the question as to the discovery or inspection.

Upon the argument of such case the Court and the parties shall be at liberty to refer to the whole contents of such documents, and the Court shall be at liberty to draw from the facts and documents stated in any such special case any inference, whether of fact or law, which might have been drawn therefrom if proved at a trial.

Statement of Claim.

1. W. H., of H., in the county of L., duly made his last will, dated the Claim. 19th day of March 1861, whereby he appointed the defendants the executors thereof, and bequeathed to them all his personal estate in trust, to call in, sell, and convert the same into money, and thereout to pay his debts and funeral and testamentary expenses, and to divide the ultimate surplus into

854

Ch. 77. Swpremc CH.vfJudioatwre Act (1878) Amt. 38 & 39 Ykt.

three shares, and to pay one of such three shares to each of his two children, T. H., and E., the wife of E. W., and to stand possessed of the remaining third share upon trust for the children of the testator's son J. H. in equal shares, to be divided among them when the youngest of such children should attain the age of 21 years. And the testator devised his real estates to the defendants upon trust until the youngest child of the said J. H. should attain the age of 21 years, to pay one third part of the rents thereof to the said T. H., and one other third part thereof to the said E. W., and to accumulate the remaining third part by way of compound interest, and so soon as the youngest child of the said J. H. should attain the age of 21 years, to sell the said real estates, and out of the proceeds of such sale to pay the sum of 1,000/. to the said T. H., and to invest one moiety of the residue in manner therein mentioned, and stand possessed thereof in trust to pay the income thereof to the* said E., the wife of the said E. W.t during her life for her 'separate use, and after her death for her children, the interests of such children being contingent on their attaining the age of 21 years, and to divide the other moiety at such proceeds of sale and the accumulations of the third share of rents tlierein-before directed to be accumulated among such of the children of the said J. H. as should be then living, and the issue of such of them as should be then dead, in equal shares per stirpes.

2. The testator died on the 25th day of April 1873, and his said will was proved by the defendants in the montn of June 1873.

3. The testator died possessed of one third share in a leasehold colliery called the Paradise Colliery, and in the engines, machinery, stock in trade, book debts, and effects belonging thereto. He was also entitled to real estate, and other personal estate.

4. The testator left T. H. and E., the wife of E. W., him surviving. J. H. had died in the testator's lifetime, leaving four children, and no more. The plaintiff C.B. is the youngest of the children of J. H., and attained the age of 21 years on the 1st of June 1871. The other three children of J. fiL died without issue in the lifetime of the testator.

5. E. W. has several children, but no child has attained the age of 21 years.

6. T. H. is the testator's heir-at-law.

7. The defendants have not called in, sold, and converted into money the whole of the testator's personal estate, but have allowed a considerable part thereof to remain outstanding; and in particular the defendants have not called in, sold, or converted into money the testator's interest in the said colliery, but have, from the death of the testator to the present time, continued to work the same in partnership with the other persons interested therein. The estate of the testator has sustained considerable loss by reason of such interest not having been called in, sold, or converted into money.

8. The defendants did not upon the death of the testator sell the. testator's furniture, plate, linen, and china, but allowed the testator's widow to possess herself of a meat part thereof, without accounting for the same, and the same has thereby been lost to the testator's estate.

9. The defendants have not invested the share of the testator's residuary personal estate given by his will to the children of the testator's son J. H., and have not accumulated one third of the rents and profits of his real estate as directed by the said will, but have mixed the same share and rents with their own moneys, and employed them in business on their own account.

10. The defendants have sold part of the real estates of the testator, but a considerable part thereof remains unsold.

11. A receiver ought to be appointed of the outstanding personal estate of the testator, and the rents and profits of his real estate remaining unsold.

The plaintiffs claim:—

1. That the estate of the said testator may be administered, and the

trusts of his will carried into execution under the direction of the court.

2. That it may be declared that the defendants, by carrying on the

business of the said colliery instead of realising the same, have

855

1875. Supreme Court of Judicature (1873) Amt. Ch. 77.

committed a breach of trust, and that the parties interested in the testator's estate are entitled to the value or the testator's interest in the said partnership property as it stood at the testator's death, with interest thereon, or at their election to the profits which have been made by the defendants in respect thereof since the testator's death, whichever shall be found most for their benefit.

3. That an account may be taken of the interest of the testator in the said

colliery, and in the machinery, book debts, stock, and effects belong in# thereto, according to the value thereof at the testator's death, and an account of all sums of money received by or by the order, or for the use of the defendants, or either of them, on account of the testator's interest in the said colliery, and that the defendants may be ordered to make good to the estate of the testator the loss arising from their not having realised the interest of the testator in the said colliery within a reasonable time after his decease.

4. That an account may be taken of all other personal estate of the

testator come to the hands of the defendants, or either of them, or to the hands of any other person by their or either of their order, or for their or either of their use, or which, but for their wilful neglect or default, might have been so received; and an account of the rents and profits of the testator's real estate, and the monevs arising from the sale thereof, possessed or received by or by the order, or for the use of the defendants, or either of them.

6. That the real estate of the testator remaining unsold may be sold under the direction of the court.

6. That the defendants may be decreed, at the election of the parties

interested in the testator's estate, either to pay interest at the rate of 5Z. per cent, per annum upon such moneys belonging to the estate of the testator as they have improperly mixed with then own moneys and employed in business on their own account, and that half-yearly rests may be made in taking such account as respects all moneys which by the said will were directed to be accumulated, or to account for all profits by the employment in their business of the said trust money.

7. That a receiver may be appointed of the outstanding personal estate

of the testator, and to receive the' rents and profits of his real estate remaining unsold.

8. Such further or other relief as the nature of the case may require.

Chancery Division.

[Name of Judge.]

Between A.B. and C. his wife - - - Plaintiffs,

and

E.F. and G.H. - Defendants.

Statement of Defence of the above-named Defendants.

1. Shortly after the decease of the testator, the defendants, as bis executors, possessed themselves of and converted into money the testator's personal estate, except his share in the colliery mentioned in the plaintiffc statement of claim. The moneys so arising were applied in payment of part of the testator's debts and funeral and testamentary expenses, but such moneys were not sufficient for the payment thereof in full.

2. The Paradise colliery was, at the testator's decease, worked by him in partnership with J. Y., and W. Y., and T. Y., both since deceased. No written articles of partnership had been entered into, and for many years the testator had not taken any part in the management of the said colliery, but it was managed exclusively by the other partners, and the defendants did not know with certainty to what share therein the testator was entitled.

3. Upon the death of the testator, the defendants endeavoured to ascertain the value of the testator's share in the colliery, but the other partners refused to give them any information. The defendants thereupon had the

856

Ch.77. Supreme Ct.ofJudicaiure Act (1873) Ami. 38&39Vict.

book 8 of the colliery examined by a competent accountant, but they had been so carelessly kept that it was impossible to obtain from them any accurate information respecting the state of the concern; it was, however, ascertained that a considerable sum was due to the testator's estate.

4. Between the death of the testator and the beginning of the year 1874 the defendants made frequent applications to J. Y., W. Y., and T. Y. for a settlement of the accounts of the colliery. Such applications having proved fruitless, the defendants, in January 1874, filed their bill of com* plaint in the Court of Chancery against J. Y., W. Y., and T. Y., praying lor an account of the partnership dealings between the testator and the defendants thereto, and that the partnership might be wound up under the direction of the Court.

5. The said T. Y. died in the year 1874, and the suit was revived against J. P. and T. S., his executors. The suit is still pending.

6. As to the Paradise colliery, the defendants have acted to the best of their judgment for the benefit of the testator's estate, and they deny being under any liability in respect of the said colliery not having been realised. They submit to act under the direction of the Court as to the further prose* cution of the said suit and generally as to the realisation of the testator's interest in the said colliery.

7. With respect to the statements in the eighth paragraph of the state* ment of claim, the defendants say, that upon the death of the testator, they sold the whole of his furniture, linen, and china, and also all his plate, except a few silver teaspoons of very small value, which were taken possession of by his widow, and they applied the proceeds of such sale as part of the testator's personal estate, and they deny being under any liability in respect of such furniture, linen, china, and plate.

8. With respect to the statements in paragraph seven of the statement of claim, the defendants say that all moneys received by them, or either of them, on account of the testator's estate, were paid by them to their executorship account at the bank of Messrs. H. and Co., and until the sale of the testator's real estate took place as herein-after mentioned, the balance to their credit was never greater than was necessanr for the administration of the trusts of the testator's will, and they therefore were unable to make any such investment or accumulation as directed by the testator's will. No moneys belonging to the testator's estate have ever been mixed with the moneys of the defendants, or either of them, nor has any money of the testator's been employed in business since the testator's decease, except that his share in the said colliery, for the reason herein-before appearing, has not been got in.

1. The plaintiffs are manufacturers of artificial manures, carrying on

business at , in the county of

3. In the early part of the year , the plaintiffs commenced, and

down to the 187 , continued to consign to the defendants, as

their agents, large quantities of their manures for sale, and the defendants sold the same, and received the price thereof and accounted to the plaintiffs therefor.

4. No express agreement has ever been entered into between the plaintiffs and the defendants with respect to the terms of the defendants employment as agents. The defendants mive always charged the plaintiffs a commission at per cent, on all sales effected by them, which is the rate of commission ordinarily charged by del credere agents in the said trade. And the defendants in fact, always accounted to the plaintiffs for the price, whether they received the same from the purchasers or not.

5. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants are liable to them as del credere agents, but if not so liable are under the circumstances herein-after mentioned liable as ordinary agents.

6. On the , the plaintiffs consigned to the defendants for

sale a large quantity of goods, including tons of

of part of such goods to one G.H. for I., at three months

credit, and delivered the same to him.

8. G.H. was not, at that time, in good credit and was in insolvent circumstances, and the defendants might, by ordinary care and diligence, have ascertained the fact.

9. G.H. did not pay for the said goods, but before the expiration of the

said three months for which credit had been given was adjudicated a bankrupt, and the plaintiffs have never received the said sum of I. or any

part thereof.

The plaintiffs claim:—

1. Damages to the amount of I.

2. Such further or other relief as the nature of the case may require.

[Title as in claim, omitting date of issue of writ.]

Statement of Defence.

1. The defendants deny that the said commission of per cent,

mentioned in paragraph 4 of the claim is the rate of commission ordinarily charged by del credere agents in the said trade, and say that the same is the ordinary commission for agents other than del credere agents, and they deny that they ever accounted to the plaintiffs for the price of any goods, except after they had received the same from the purchasers.

2. The defendants deny that they were ever liable to the plaintiffs as del credere agents.

3. With respect to the eighth paragraph of the plaintiffs statement of claim, the defendants say that at the time of the said sale to the said G.H., the said G.H. was a person in good credit. If it be true that the said G.H. was then in insolvent circumstances (which the defendants do not admit), the defendants did not and had no reason to suspect the same, and could not by ordinary care or diligence have ascertained the fact.

2. In the month of February 1873, Messrs. L. and Company, of Alexandria, caused to be shipped 6,110 ardebs of cotton seed on board the said vessel, then lying in Fort Said (Egypt), and the then master of the vessel received the same, to be carried from Port Said to Hall, upon the terms of three bills of lading, signed by the master, and delivered to Messrs. L. and Company.

3. The three bills of lading, being in form exactly similar to one another, were and are, so far as is material to the present case, in the words, letters, and figures following, that is to say :—

" Shipped in good order and well conditioned by L. & Co. Alexandria " (Egypt) in and upon the good ship called the * Ida/ whereof is " master for the present voyage Ambrozio Chiapella, and now riding " at anchor in the port of Port Said (Egypt) and bound for Hull, " six thousand one hundred and ten ardeb9 cotton seed being marked " and numbered as in the margin, and are to be delivered in the like " good order and well-conditioned at the aforesaid Port of Hull (the " act of God, the Queen's enemies, fire and all and every other " dangers and accidents of the seas, rivers, and navigation of wnatever " nature and kind soever, save risk of boats so far as ships are liable " thereto excepted), unto order or to assigns paying freight for the " said goods at the rate of (19s.) say nineteen shillings sterling in full " per ton of 20 cwt. delivered with ^10 gratuity.

6. The cotton seed was delivered to the plaintiffs but not in as good.order and condition as it was in when shipped at Port Said; but was delivered to the plaintiffs greatly damaged.

7. The deterioration of the cotton seed was not occasioned by any of the perils or causes in the bills of lading excepted.

8. By reason of the premises the plaintiffs lost a great part of the value of the said cotton seed, and were put to great expense in and about keeping, warehousing, and improving the condition of the said cotton seed, and in and about having the same surveyed.

THE "ONWARD."

Between A.B. and C.D. - Plaintiffs,

and

B.F. and O.H. - Defendants.

Statement of Claim.

1. The " Onward," a ship of 933 tons register, or thereabouts, belonging to the United States of America, whilst on a voyage from Moulmein to Queenstown or Falmouth, for orders, and from thence to a port of discharge in the United Kingdom or on the Continent, between Bordeaux and Hamburg, both ports inclusive, laden with a cargo of teak timber, was compelled to put into Port Louis, in the island of Mauritius, in order to repair and refit.

2. The master of the " Onward," being without ftinds or credit at Port Louis, and being unable to pay the expense of the said repairs, and the necessary disbursements of the said ship at Port Louis, so as to enable the said ship to resume and prosecute her voyage, and after having communicated with his owners and with the owners and consignees of the cargo was compelled to resort to a loan of 24,369 dollars on bottomry of the said ship, her cargo and freight, for the purpose of enabling him to pay the said expenses and disbursements, which sum Messrs. H. and Company, of Post Louis, at the request of the master by public advertisement, advanced to the said master at and after the rate of 128 dollars for every 100 dollars advanced, and accordingly the said master, by a bond of bottomry, dated the 13th of October 1870, by him duly executed in consideration of the sum of 24,369 dollars, Mauritius currency, paid to him by the B&id Messrs. H. and Company, bound himself and the said ship and her cargo, namely, about 940 tons of teak timber, and her freight, to pav unto Messrs. H. and Company, their assigns, or order or indorsees, the said sum of 24,369 dollars with the aforesaid maritime premium thereon, within twenty dayB next after the arrival of the " Onward " at her port of discharge, from the said intended voyage, the said payment to be made both in capital and interest in British sterling money, at and after the rate of 4s. for every dollar, with a condition, that in case the said ship and cargo should be lost, during her voyage from Port Louis to Queenstown or Falmouth, for orders, and thence to her port of discharge in the United Kingdom or on the Continent between Bordeaux and Hamburg, both ports inclusive, then, that the said sum of 24,369 dollars, and maritime premium thereon, should not be recoverable.

3. The " Onward " subsequently proceeded on her voyage, and on the 7th of February 1871, arrived with her cargo on board at the port of Liverpool, which was her port of discharge.

4. The bond was duly indorsed and assigned to the plaintiffs.

5. The ship has been sold by order of the Court, and the proceeds of the sale thereof have been brought into Court, and the freight has also been paid into Court.

6. The said sum of 24,369 dollars, with the maritime premium thereon, still remain due to the plaintiffs. By a decree made on the 10th of May 1871, the Court pronounced for the validity of the bond, so far as regarded the ship and freight, and condemned the proceeds of the ship and freight in the amount due on the bond. The principal and premium still remain owing to the plaintiffs, and the proceeds of the said ship and her freight available for payment thereof are insufficient for such payment.

The plaintiffs claim :—

1. That the Court pronounce for the validity of the bond so far as re-

gards the cargo:

2. That the Court condemn the defendants and their bail in so much

of the amount due to the plaintiffs on the bond, for principal, maritime premium, and for interest from the time when such principal and premium ought to have been paid, as the proceeds

[Title.]

Defence.

The defendants say that the—

1. Several averments in the second article of the statement contained are respectively untrue, except the averment that the bottomry bond therein mentioned was given and executed.

3. The " Onward *' proceeded on the voyage in the first paragraph of the claim mentioned, under a charter-party made between the defendants wad the owners of the vessel, who resided at New York. And the cargo in the said paragraph mentioned belonged to the defendants, and was shipped at Moulmein, by Messieurs T., F., and Company, of Moulmein, consigned to the defendants.

4. When the " Onward " put into Port Louis, the master placed his ship in the hands of Messieurs H. and Company, the persons in the second paragraph of the claim mentioned, and the repairs and disbursements in the said second article mentioned were made, directed, and expended under the orders, management, and on the credit of said Messieurs H. and Company, who at the outset contemplated the necessity of securing themselves by the hypothecation of the ship, freight, and cargo.

5. The master of the " Onward " and Messrs. H. and Company did not communicate to the said shippers of the cargo, or to the defendants who carried on business at Glasgow, as the master knew the intention of hypothecating the ship, freight, and cargo, or the circumstances which might render such hypothecation advisable or necessary, but on the contrary, without reasonable cause or excuse, abstained from so doing, although the comparatively small value of the ship and frejght to be earned, rendered it all the more important that such communication should have been made.

6. A reasonable and proper time was not allowed to elapse between the advertisements for the bottomry loan, and the acceptance of Messieurs H. and Company's offer to make such loan.

[Title.]

Reply.

1. The plaintiffs say that the defendants, since the 31st day of December 1868, have been the only persons forming the firm of T., F., and Co., of Moulmein, mentioned in the third paragraph of the defence.

2. After the master of the " Onward *' put into Port Louis as aforesaid, he employed Messieurs H. and Company, in the claim mentioned, as his agents, and by his directions they by letter communicated to the defendants firmB at Moulmein and Glasgow the circumstances of the ship's distress, and the estimated amount of her repairs.

3. The said Messieurs H. and Company shortly after the said ship was put into their hands at Port Louis, offered the said master, in case he should require them to do so, to make the necessary advances for the ship's repairs, and to take his draft at 90 days sight on Messrs. B. Brothers, of Xondon, at the rate of 5 per cent, discount for the amount of the advances, together with a liottomry bond on ship, cargo, and freight as collateral security, the bond to be void should the draft be accepted. The said master, and the said Messieurs H. and Company, by letter, communicated to the owners of the " Onward *' the circumstances of the said ship's distress, and the aforesaid offer of the said Messrs. H. and Company, and the said master by his letter requested the said owners to give him their directions on the subject. The said owners shortly after receiving such letters, by letter communicated with the defendants at Glasgow, and forwarded to them copies of the said lastly-mentioned letters of the said master, and of the said Messrs. H. and Co.

4. The defendants houses at Moulmein and Glasgow respectively received the letters referred to in the second paragraph of this reply in time to have

1875. Swpreme Court of Judicature Ad (1873) Amt. Ch. 77*

communicated with the said master at Port Louis before the giving of the said bottomiy bond.

5. The defendants received the said copies of letters referred to in paragraph 4 of this reply, in time for them to have communicated thereon with the said master at Port Louis before the giving of the said bond.

6. The defendants did not at any time answer the said communications of the said Messrs. H. and Company, or in any way communicate or attempt to communicate with the said master, or to direct him not to give, or to prevent him from giving the said bottomry bond on the said cargo.

7. The said bond was duly advertised for sale, and was subsequently, and after a proper interval had elapsed, sold by auction in the usual way.

There were several bidders at the sale, and the said Messrs. H. and Com-

Sany were the lowest bidders in premium, and the said bond was knocked own to them. The said bond was not advertised for until the said ship was ready for sea, and up to that time the master of the said ship had expected to hear from her owners, and had hoped to be put in funds, and had not finally determined to resort to bottomry of the said ship, or her cargo or fireignt.

8. Save as herein appears the plaintiffs deny the truth of the several allegations contained in the said answer.

Statement of Claim.

1. The plaintiffs were, on the 1st August 1874, the owners of the steam- Claim, ship " British Queen."

2. On the 1st August 1874, the ship being then in Calcutta, a charter-party was there entered into between John Smith, the master, on behalf of' himself and the owners of the said ship, of the one part, and the defendants of, the other part.

3. By the said charter-party it was agreed, amongst other things, that the defendants should be entitled to the whole carrying power of the said steamship for the period of four months certain, commencing from the said 1st August 1874, upon a voyage or voyages between Calcutta and Mauritius and back; that the defendants should pay for such use of the said steamship to the plaintiffs agents at Calcutta, monthly, the sum of 1,000/ .; that the charter should terminate at Calcutta; and that if at the expiration of the said period of four months the said steamship should be upon a voyage, tnen the defendants should pay pro rat& for the hire of the ship up to her arrival at Calcutta, and the complete discharge of her cargo there.

4. The " British Queen " made several voyages in pursuance of the said charter-party, and the first three monthly sums of 1,000/. each were duly paid.

5. The period of four months expired on the 1st December 1874, and at that time the steamship was on a voyage from Mauritius to Calcutta. She arrived at Calcutta on the 13th December, and the discharge of her cargo there was completed on the 16th December 1874.

6. The plaintiffs agents at Calcutta called upon the defendants to pay to them the fourth monthly sum of 1,000/., and a sum of 500/. for the hire of the steamship from the 1st to the 16th December 1874, but the defendants have not paid any part of the said sums.

The plaintiffs claim—

The sum of 1,500/., and interest upon 1,000/., part thereof, from the 1st December 1874, until judgment.

The plaintiffs propose that this action should be tried in London.

[Title.]

Statement of Difence.

Defence. 1. By the charter-party sued upon it was expressly provided that if any

accident should happen to, or any repairs should become necessary to the engines or boilers of the said steamship, the time occupied in repairs should be deducted from the period of the said charter, and a proportionate reduction in the charter money should be made.

2. On the repairs became necessary to the engines and boilers

of the steamship, and ten days were occupied in effecting such repairs.

3. On the an accident happened to the engines of the steamship at Mauritius, and two days were occupied in effecting the repairs necessary in consequence thereof.

4. The defendants are therefore entitled to a reduction in the charter money of 400/.

Counter-claim. By way of set-off and counter-claim the defendants claim as follows:—

5. By the charter-party it was expressly provided that the charterers should furnish funds for the steamship's necessary disbursements, except in the port of Calcutta, without* any commission or interest on any sum so advanced.

6. The defendants paid for the necessary disbursements of the ship in the

port of Mauritius between the and the 1874, sums

amounting in all to 625/. 14s. 6d.

7. The charter-party also contained an express warranty that the steamship was at the date thereof capable of steaming nine knots an hour on a consumption of 30 tons of coal a day, and it was further provided by the charter-party that the charterers should provide coal for the use of the said steamship.

8. The steamship was at the date of the charter-party only capable of steaming less than eight knots to an hour, and that only on a consumption of more than 35 tons of coal a day.

9. In consequence of the matters mentioned in the last paragraph, the steamship finally arrived at Calcutta at least 15 days later, and remained under charter at least 15 days longer than she would otherwise have done. She was also during the whole period of the said charter at sea for a much larger number of days than she would otherwise have been, and consumed a much larger quantity of coal on each of such days than she would otherwise have done, whereby the defendants were obliged to provide for the use of the steamship much larger quantities of coal than they would otherwise have been.

The defendants claim—

/. damages in respect of the matters stated in this set-off and

counter-claim.

[Title.]

y* 1. The plaintiff joins issue upon the second, third, and fourth paragraphs

of the defendant's statement of defence.

2. With respect to the alleged set-off stated in paragraph 6 the plaintiff does not admit the correctness of the amount therein stated. And all sums advanced by them for disbursements were paid or allowed to them by the plaintiffs by deducting the amount thereof from the third monthly sum of 1,000/. paid (subject to such deduction) to the plaintiffs agents at Calcutta by the defendant on or about the 12th November 1874.

3. With respect to the alleged breach of warranty and the alleged damages therefrom stated in the 7th, 8th, and 9th paragraphs, the plaintiffs

L.

865

1875. Sv/preme Court of Judicature Act (1873) Amt. Ch. 77.

say that the steamship was at the date of the charter-party capable of steaming nine knots an hour on a consumption of 30 tons of coal a day.

If the steamship did not, during the said charter, steam more than eight knots an hour, and that on a consumption of more than 35 tons a day, as alleged (which the plaintiffs do not admit), it was * in consequence of the bad and unfit quality of the coals provided by the defendants for the ship's use.

The " American " is a screw steamship, of 1,368 tons register, with engines of 200-horse power nominal, belonging to the port of Liverpool, and at the time of the occurrences herein-after mentioned was manned by a crew of 40 hands all told, laden with a cargo of general merchandise, and bound from Port-au-Prince in the West Indies to Liverpool.

2. About 8.5 a.m. on the 28th of November 1874, the " American 99 was in latitude 46° N., longitude 38° 16' W., steering E. by S. true magnetic, making under ail sail and steam about 12 knots an hour, the wind being about S.W. by S. true magnetic, blowing a strong breeze and the weather hazy, when a vessel, which afterwards proved to be the brigantine " Katie," was observed on the " American's 99 starboard bow about four miles distant, bearing about S.E. by E. true magnetic, close-hauled to the wind, and steering a course nearly parallel to that of the " American."

3. The " American " kept her course, and when the " Katie99 was about three miles distant her ensign was observed by those on board the " American " run up to the main, and she was seen to have altered her course, and to be bearing down towards the " American." The " American's" ensign was afterwards run up, and her master, supposing that the " Katie " wanted to correct her longitude, or to speak the M American," continued on his course expecting that the " Katie," when she had got sufficiently close to speak or show her black board over her starboard side, would luff to the wind, and pass to windward of the " American."

4. The master of the "American" watched the "Katie" as she continued to approach the " American," and when she had approached as near as he deemed it prudent for her to come, he waved to her to luff, and shortly afterwards, on his observing her to be attempting to cross the bows of the " American," the helm of the latter was immediately put to starboard, and engines stopped and reversed full speed; but notwithstanding, the " American " with her stem came into collision with the port side of the " Katie," a little forward of the main rigging.

5. The " American's " engines were then stopped, and when the crew of the " Katie " had got on board of the " American," the latter's engines were reversed to get her clear of the "Katie," which sunk under the " American's " bows.

6. The " Katie " improperly approached too close to the " American."

7. Those on board the " Katie " improperly neglected to luff, and to pass to windward of the " American."

8. Those on board the " Katie " improperly attempted to cross the bows of the " American."

9. Those on board the " Katie " improperly ported her helm before the said collision.

10. Those on board the " Katie " improperly neglected to starboard her helm before the said collision.

T., of Nova Scotia, in consideration of the sum of 5,000 dollars advanced by him to the said owners, and for the purpose of securing the repayment by them to him of the said sum with interest thereon.

2. By an instrument of transfer, dated the 16th of July 1868, in the form prescribed by the said Act, and executed by G. T., in consideration of the sum of 5,000 dollars to G. T. paid by the defendant, G. T. transferred to the defendant the mortgage security.

3. The said sum of 5,000 dollars, with interest thereon, still remains due on the said security.

On the contrary, the said vessel could have gone to sea and proceeded on and prosecuted her voyage without such equipments, repairs, and articles referred to as aforesaid, and such equipments, repairs, and other articles were done and effected and supplied for the purpose of reclassing the said vessel, and not for any other purpose; and the claim of the plaintiffs is not a claim for necessaries within the meaning of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, s. 5.

6. The alleged necessaries were not supplied on the credit of the said vessel, but upon the personal credit of J. B., who was the broker for the vessel, and upon the agreement that the plaintiffs were not to have recourse to the vessel.

7. The defendant did not, nor did G. T., in any way order, authorise, or become liable for, and neither of them is in any way liable in respect of the said alleged supplies or any part thereof, and the said vessel was at the time of the commencement of this action and she still is of a less value than the amount which, irrespective of the sums referred to in the next article of this answer, is due to the defendant on the said mortgage security.

And between the said O. S. - - - Plaintiff,

and

The said R. W. and J. B., and J.W.- Defendants,

(by counter-claim.)

The Defence and Counter-claim of the above-named O. S.

1. This defendant does not admit that the contents of the indenture of the 25th day of March 1867, in the plaintiff's statement of complaint mentioned, are correctly stated therein.

2. The indenture of the 1st day of April 1867, in the statement of claim mentioned, was not a security for the sum of 15,000/. and interest at 51. per cent, per annum, but for the sum of 14,000/. only, with interest at the rate of 41. 10s. per cent, per annum.

3. This defendant submits that under the circumstances in his counterclaim mentioned, the said indentures of the 25th day of March 1867 and the 1st day of April 1867, did not create any effectual security upon the mines and minerals in and under the lands in the same indentures comprised, and that the same mines and minerals ought to be treated as excepted out of the said securities.

And by way of counter-claim this defendant states as follows:—

1. At the time of the execution of the indenture next herein-after stated,

J. C. A. was seised in fee simple in possession of the lands described in the said indentures, and the mines and minerals in and under the same.

2. By indenture dated the 24th of March 1860, made between the said

J. C. A. of the first part, E. his wife, then E. S., spinster, of the second part, and this defendant and the above-namea J. W. of the third part, being a settlement made in contemplation of the marriage, shortly after solemnized, between the said J. C. A. and his said wife, the said J. C. A. granted to this defendant and the said J.W., and their heirs, all the coal mines, beds of coal, and other the mines and minerals under the said lands, with such powers and privileges

1875. Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) Amt. Ch. 77.

87?

as in the now-stating indenture mentioned, for the purpose of winning, working, and getting the same mines and minerals, to hold the same premises to this defendant and the said J. W. and their heirs to the use of the said J. C. A., his heirs and assigns, till the solemnization of the said marriage, and after the solemnization thereof to the use of this defendant and the said J. W., their executors and administrators, for the term of 600 years, from the day of the date of the now-stating indenture, upon the trusts therein mentioned, being trusts for the benefit of the said J. C. A., and his wife and the children of their marriage, and from and after the expiration or other determination of the said term vof 600 years, and in the meantime subject thereto, to the use of the said J. G. A., his heirs and assigns for ever.

3. By indenture dated the 12th of May 1860, made between the said

J. C. A. of the one part, and W. N. of the other part, the said J. C. A. granted to the said W. N. and his heirs the said lands, except the coal mines, beds of coal, and other mines and minerals thereunder, to hold the same premises unto and to the use of the said W. N., his heirs and assigns for ever, by way of mortgage, for securing the payment to the said W. N., his executors, administrators, or assigns, of the sum of 26,000/., with interest as therein mentioned.

4. On the 14th of January 1864, the said J. C. A. was adjudicated a

bankrupt, and shortly afterwards J. L. was appointed creditor's assignee of his estate.

5. Some time after the said bankruptcy, the said W. N., under a power

of sale in his said mortgage deed, contracted with this defendant for the absolute sale to this defendant of the property comprised in his said security for an estate in fee simple in possession, free from incumbrances, for the sum of 26,0001, and the said J. L., as such assignee as aforesaid, agreed to join in the conveyance to this defendant for the purpose of signifying his assent to such sale.

6. By indenture dated the 1st of September 1866, made between the said

W. N. of the first part, the said J. L. of the second part, the said J. C. A. of the third part, and this defendant of the fourth part, reciting the said agreement for sale, and reciting that the said J. L., being satisfied that the said sum of 26,000/. was a proper price, had, with the sanction of the Court of Bankruptcy, agreed to confirm the said sale, it was witnessed that in consideration of the sum of 26,000/., with the privity and approbation of the said J. L., paid by this defendant to the said W. N., he the said W. N. granted, and the said J. C. A. ratified and confirmed to this defendant and his heirs, all the hereditaments comprised in the said security of the 12th day of May 1860, with their rights, members, and appuitenances, and all the estate, right, title, and interest of them, the said W. N. and J. C. A. therein, to hold the same premises unto and to the use of this defendant, his heirs and assigns for ever.

7- The sale to this defendant was not intended to include anything not included in the security of the 12th of May 1860, and the said J. L. only concurred therein to signify bis approval of the said sale, and did not purport to convey any estate vested in him; and the lastly herein-before stated indenture did not vest in this defendant any estate in the said mines and minerals.

8. The plaintiff and the defendant J. B. respectively had before they advanced to this defendant the moneys lent by them on their securities in the plaintiff's claim mentioned, full notice that the mines and minerals under the said lands did not belong to this defendant. This fact appeared on the abstracts of title delivered to them before the preparation of their said securities. A valuation of the property made by a surveyor wfts furnished to them respectively on behalf of this defendant before they agreed to advance their money on their said securities; but although the said lands are in a mineral district, the mines and minerals were omitted from such valuation, and they

872

respectively knew at the time of taking their said securities that the same did not include any interest in the mines and minerals.

9. At the time when the securities of the plaintiff and the defendant

J. B. were respectively executed, the plaintiff and the defendant J. B. respectively had notice of the said indenture of settlement of the 24th day of March 1860.

10. At the time when the plaintiffs security was executed, the mines and minerals under the said lands, with such powers and privileges as aforesaid, were vested in this defendant and the said J. W. for the residue of the said term of 500 years, and subject to the said term, the inheritance in the same mines, minerals, powers, and privileges was vested in the said J. L. as such assignee as aforesaid.

11. The said security to the plamtiff was by mistake framed so as to purport to include the mines and minerals under the said lands, and by virtue thereof the legal estate in moiety of the said mines and minerals became and now is vested in the plaintiff for the residue of the said term of 500 years.

The defendant O. S. claims as follows:

1. That it may be declared that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant

J. B. has any charge or lien upon that one undivided moiety, which in manner aforesaid became vested in the plaintiff for the residue of the said term of 500 years, of and in the mines and minerals in and under the lands mentioned in the plaintiff*s said security.

2. That it may be declared that the said mines and minerals, rights

and privileges, which by the said indenture of settlement were vested in the defendant O. S. and the said J. W. for the said term of 500 years, upon trust as therein mentioned, ought to be so conveyed and assured as that the same may become vested in the defendant

O. S. and the said J. W. for all the residue of the said term upon the trusts of the said settlement.

3. That the said R. W. and J. W. may be decreed to execute all such

assurances as may be necessary for giving effect to the declaration secondly herein-before prayed.

require.

(by counter-claim.)

The Reply of the Plaintiff R. W.

1. The plaintiff joins issue with the defendants upon their several defences, and in reply to the statements alleged by the defendant O. S., by way of counter-claim, the plaintiff says as follows:

1. The plaintiff does not admit the execution of any such indenture as is

stated in the said counter-claim to bear date the 24th of March 186°.

2. The plaintiff does not admit that the indenture of the 12th of May

1860 is stated correctly in the statement of claim.

3. When the defendant O. S., in the year 1866, applied to the plaintiff

to advance him the sum of 10,000/., he offerea to the plaintiff as a security the landB which were afterwards comprised in the indenture of the 25th of March 1867, including the mines and minerals

873

1875. Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) Amt. Cfl. 77.

which he now alleges were not to form part of the security, and the plaintiff agreed to lend the said sum upon the security of the said lands, including such mines and minerals. During the negocia-tion for the said loan a valuation of the property to be included in the mortgage was delivered to the plaintiff on behalf of the said defendant. Such valuation included the mines and minerals; and the plaintiff consented to make the loan on the faith of such valuation. The plaintiff did not know when he took his security that it did not include any interest in the said mines and minerals; on the contrary, he believed that the entirety of such mines and minerals was to be included therein.

4. The plaintiff does not admit the contents of the indenture of the

1st of September 1866 to be as alleged, or that it was so framed as not to include the said mines and minerals, or that it was not intended to include anything not included in the security of the 12th of May 1860, or that J. L. in the counter-claim named only concurred therein to signify his approval of the said sale, and did not purport to convey any estate vested in him.

5. Save so far as the plaintiff's solicitor may have had notice by means

of the abstract of title that the mines and minerals under the said lands did not belong to the defendant O. S., the plaintiff had not any notice thereof, and he does not admit that it appeared from the abstract of title that such was the case. The mines were not omitted from any valuation delivered to the plaintiff as mentioned in the counter-claim.

6. The plaintiff admits that when he took his security he was aware that

there was indorsed on the deed by which the said lands were conveyed by J. C. A. in the counter-claim named a notice of a settlement of 24th March 1860, but he had no further or other notice thereof, and though his solicitor inquired after such settlement none was ever produced.

7. The plaintiff submits that if it shall appear that no further interest

in the said mines and minerals was conveyed to him by his said security than one undivided moiety of a term of 600 years therein, as alleged by the said counter-claim, such interest is effectually included in the plaintiff's said security, and that he is entitled to foreclose the same.

The defendant says that at the time when he made the representations mentioned in the third paragraph of the statement of claim and throughout the whole of the transactions between the plaintiff and defendant, and down to the completion of the purchase and the relinquishment by the defendant of the said shop and business to the plaintiff, the said business was an increasing business, and was a business of over 12 sacks a week. And the defendant denies the allegations of the sixth paragraph of the statement of claim.

2. The defendant repeatedly during the negociations told the plaintiff that he must not act upon any statement or representation of his, but must ascertain for himself the extent and value of the said business. And the defendant handed to the plaintiff for this purpose the whole of his books, showing fully and truthfully all the details of the said business, and from which the nature, extent, and value thereof could be fully seen, and those books were examined for that purpose by the plaintiff, and by an accountant on his behalf.

THE " LADY OF THE LAKE."

Between A.B. ----- Plaintiff, and

E.F. ----- Defendant.

Statement of Claim.

1. On or about the 15th of July 1868, an agreement was entered into between the plaintiff and J. D., who was then the sole owner of the above-named barque " Lady of the Lake," whereby J. D. agreed to sell, and the plaintiff agreed to purchase, 32-64th parts or shares of the vessel for the sum of 500/ .; payment 300/. in cash, and the remainder by purchaser's acceptances at three and six months date, and it was thereby agreed that the plaintiff was to be commander of the vessel.

2. The plaintiff accordingly paid to J. D. the sum of 300/., and gave him his (the plaintiff's) acceptances at three and six months date for the residue of the said purchase money, and J. D. by bill of sale transferred 32-64th parts or shares in the vessel to the plaintiff, which bill of sale was duly registered on the 18th of July 1868; the plaintiff has since been and still is the registered owner of such 32-64th shares.

3. The vessel then sailed under the plaintiff's command on a voyage from Sunderland to the Brazils and other ports, and then on a homeward voyage to Liverpool, where she arrived on the 18th of June 1869, and having there discharged her homeward cargo she sailed thence under the plaintiff5s command with a cargo to the Tyne, and thence to Sunderland, at which port she arrived on the 9th of August 1869.

4. The plaintiff then made several ineffectual applications to J. D., with a view to obtaining another charter for the said vessel, and after she had been lying idle for a considerable time, the plaintiff on or about the 16th of September 1869, obtained an advantageous charter for her to proceed to Barcelona with a cargo of coals, and with a view to enabling her to execute such charter the plaintiff paid the dock dues, and moved the vessel into a slipway in order that her bottom might be cleaned, but on or about the 17th of September, whilst the vessel was on the shore adjoining the slipway, the defendant, to whom the said J. D. had in the meantime transferred his 32-64th parts, forcibly took the vessel out of the possession of the plaintiff, and refused and still refuses to allow the plaintiff to take the vessel

879

1875. Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) Amt. Ch. 77.

on her said voyage to Barcelona, and by reason thereof heavy loss is being occasioned to the plaintiff.

The plaintiff claims :—

1. Judgment giving possession of the vessel " Lady of the Lake " to the

plaintiff:

2. The condemnation of the defendant in costs of suit, and in all losses

and damages occasioned by the defendant to the plaintiff:

3. Such further relief as the nature of the case requires.

[Title.]

Defence.

1. The defendant says that the acceptances in the second paragraph of Defence, the claim mentioned were respectively dishonoured by the plaintiff, and

have never yet been paid by him.

2. It was agreed between the plaintiff and J. D., that J. D. should act, and he has since always acted, as ship's husband of the " Lady of the Lake."

3. On the 31st of August 1869, J. D. sold to the defendant, for the sum of 400/., and by bill of sale duly executed, transferred to him his 32-64th shares, and the bill of sale was duly registered on the 14th of September following.

4. After the " Lady of the Lake " had arrived at Sunderland, and after the defendant had purchased from J. D. his 32-64th shares of the Lady of the Lake," the defendant placed the vessel in the custody and possession of a shipkeeper. The plaintiff, however, unlawfully removed her from such

e>ssession, and thereupon the defendant had the vessel taken into the South ock of the harbour at Sunderland, with orders that she should be kept there. What the defendant did, as in this article mentioned, he did with the consent and full approval of J. D.

5. At the time of the sale of the " Lady of the Lake " by J. D. to the defendant as afore-mentioned, there was and there still is due from the plaintiff, as part owner of the " Lady of the Lake," to J. D., as part owner and ship's husband, a sum of money exceeding 300/. in respect of the vessel and her voyages over and above the amount of the unpaid acceptances.

6. Save as herein appears, the averments in the fourth paragraph of the chum contained are untrue, and if the charter-party mentioned in that paragraph was obtained by the plaintiff as alleged, which the defendant does not admit, it was obtained by him without the authority, consent, or knowledge of J. D. or the defendant.

7. Before the defendant took possession of the vessel as afore-mentioned, the plaintiff ceased to be master of her, with the consent of J. D. or the defendant.

8. J. D. has instituted an action against the said vessel in in order to have the accounts taken between him and the plaintiff, and to enforce payment of the money due from the plaintiff to him.

[Title.]

Reply.

1. The plaintiff says in reply to the first paragraph of the defence that Reply, the bills therein mentioned were dishonoured by the plaintiff because J. D. was indebted to the plaintiff in a large amount for his wages as master, and for his share of the earnings of the " Lady of the Lake," and refused payment thereof.

2. J. D. did not place the vessel in the exclusive custody or possession of a shipkeeper as in the fifth paragraph of the defence stated or implied.

On the contrary, the vessel continued in the custody and possession of the plaintiff, who still holds her register. A man was sent on board the vessel by J. D. to look after J. D.'s share in the said vessel while she was in dock, but he did not dispossess the said plaintiff or take exclusive possession of the vessel, and the plaintiff was not dispossessed of the vessel until on or about the 17th of September last.

THE " CAMPANIL."

Between A.B. and C.D. - Plaintiffs,

and

E.F. and G.ff. - Defendants.

Statement of Claim.

1. The " Brazilian" is a screw steamer belonging to the port of Newcastle, of the burthen of 1,359 tons gross registered tonnage, and propelled by engines of 130 horse power, and at the time of the rendering of the salvage services herein-after mentioned she was navigated by her master and a crew of twenty-four hands. She left the Port of Newcastle on the 27th of November 1873, on a voyage to Genoa, and thence by way of Palmaias and Aguilas to the Tyne, and about 10 a.m. on the 26th of December 1873, in the course of her homeward voyage, with a cargo of merchandise, she was off the coast of Portugal, the island of Ons bearing about S.E. by R, when those on board her sighted a disabled steamer about four points on their starboard bow, in-shore, flying signals of distress. A strong gale was blowing at the time, and there was a very heavy sea running.

2. The " Brazilian " at once made towards the disabled steamer, which proved to be the " Campanil," the vessel proceeded against in this action. She was heavily laden with a cargo of iron ore. The " Brazilian " as she approached the " Campanil " signalled to her, and the " Campanil " answered by signal that her engines had broken down. By this time the " Campanil " was heading in-shore, rolling heavily, and shipping a large quantity of water. The " Brazilian " came under the lee of the " Campanil " and asked if she wanted assistance. Her master replied that he wanted to be towed to Vigo as his vessel had lost her screw. The master of the u Brazilian " then asked those on board the " Campanil " to send him a hawser, and for a long time those on board the " Brazilian " made attempts to get a hawser from the " Campanil," and exposed themselves and their vessel to great danger in doing so. The wind and sea rendering it impossible to get the hawser whilst the " Brazilian " was to leeward of the " Campanil," the " Brazilian " went to windward and attempted to float lines by means of life buoys to the " Campanil." During all this time the " Campanil " was quite unmanageable, and yawed about, and there was very great difficulty in manoeuvring the " Brazilian " so as to retain command over her and keep her near the " Campanil." It was necessary to keep constantly altering the engines of the " Brazilian," setting them on ahead and reversing them quickly, and in consequence the engines laboured heavily and were exposed to great danger of being strained.

3. Whilst the " Brazilian " was endeavouring to float lines to the " Campanil," the " Campanil " made a sudden lurch and struck the " Brazilian " on her port quarter, knocking in her port bulwark and rail, and causing other damage to the vessel. After many unsuccessful efforts by those on board the " Brazilian," and after they had lost two life buoys and a quantity of rope, a hawser from the u Campanil " was at length made fast on board the " Brazilian," and the " Brazilian " with the " Campanil " in tow steamed easy ahead. A second hawser was then grot out and made fast with coir springs, and the " Brazilian " then commenced to tow frill speed ahead, each hawser having a full scope of 90 fathoms.

4. The " Brazilian " made towards Vigo, which was about 35 miles distant, the vessels made about two knots an hour, the " Brazilian " keeping her engines going at full speed. The " Brazilian " laboured very heavily, and both vessels shipped large quantities of water.

5. About noon one of the tow ropes broke, and both vessels were in danger of being driven ashore, broken water and rocks appearing to leeward, distant about two miles. After great difficulty the broken hawser was made fast again with a heavy spring of a number of parts of rope, and the " Brazilian " towed ahead under the lee of Ons. Island.

885

1875. Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) Amt. Ch. 77.

6. Shortly afterwards the weather moderated and the sea went down a little, and the " Brazilian " was able to make more way, and about 7 p.m. the same day she towed the " Campanil " into Vigo harbour in safety.

7. The " Brazilian " was compelled to remain in harbour the next day to pay port charges and clear at the Custom House.

8. The coast off which the aforesaid services were rendered is rocky and exceedingly dangerous, and strong currents set along it, and but for the services rendered by the " Brazilian " the " Campanil " must have gone ashore and been wholly lost, together with her cargo, and in all probability her master and crew would have been drowned. No other steamer was' in sight, and there was not any prospect of any other efficient assistance.

9. In rendering the said services the " Brazilian " and those on board her were exposed to great danger. Owing to the heavy sea, and the necessity of towing with a Tong scope of hawser, there was great danger of fouling the screw of the " Brazilian," and it required constant vigilance on the part of the master and crew to prevent serious accident. The master and crew of the " Brazilian " underwent much extra fatigue and exertion.

10. The damage sustained by the " Brazilian " in rendering the said services amounts to the sum of 150/., and the value of the extra quantity of coal consumed in conseouence of the said services is estimated at 16/., and 41. Is. 5d. was paid by the owners of the " Brazilian " for harbour dues and other charges at Vigo.

11. The value of the "Campanil," her cargo and freight, at the time of the salvage services were as follows, that is to say: The " Campanil " was of the value of 13,000/., her cargo was of the value of 300/., and the gross amount of freight payable upon delivery of the cargo laden on board her at Barrow-in-Furness was 675/.

12. The value of the "Brazilian," her freight and cargo was about 25,050/.

The plaintiffs claim:—

1. Such an amount of salvage as to the Court may seem just:

2. That the defendants and their bail be condemned in costs:

3. Such further or other relief as the nature of the case may require.

[Title.]

- Statement of Defence.

1. The defendants say that upon the 22d of December 1873, the iron Defence, screw steamship " Campanil," of the burden of 660 tons register gross, propelled by engines of 70 horse power, navigated by David Boughton, her master, and a crew of 16 hands, left Porman, bouna to Barrow-in-Furness,

laden with a cargo of iron ore.

2. At about 8 a.m. of the 26th of December, whilst the " Campanil " was prosecuting her voyage, the shaft of her propeller broke outside the stern tube, and she lost her propeller. The " Campanil " was then brought to the wind, which was south by east, blowing fresh, and she proceeded under sail for Vigo, and continued to do so till about 9.30 a.m., when two steamships which had been for some time in sight, and coming to the northward, approached the " Campanil." The ensign of the " Campanil " was hoisted, union up, as a signal to one of such steamships, which afterwards come to the " Campanil," and proved to be the " Brazilian," whose owners, master, and crew are the plaintiffs.

3. The " Brazilian " then signalled the " Campanil " and inquired what was the matter, and was signalled in reply that the " Campanil " had lost her propeller, and required to be towed to Vigo, upon which the "Brazilian " signalled for the rope of the " Campanil," in order to take her in tow. After this the " Brazilian " steamed round the " Campanil " and up on to her starboard bow, and in so doing the " Brazilian " came with her port quarter into the starboard bow of the " Campanil " and did her considerable damage.

4. The " Brazilian " then threw a heaving line on board the " Campanil," and one of the " Campanil's " hawsers was attached to the line and hauled on board the " Brazilian," which passed one of her hawsers to the " Campanil " by means of life buoys, and when such hawsers had been secured

886 Ch.77. Supreme Ct. of Judicature Act (1873) Amt. 38&39Vict.

Beply. between the two vessels the " Brazilian " commenced to tow the " Campanil " for Vigo, it being at this time about 10.30 a.m. and Ons Island then bearing about south-east by south, and distant about 15 miles. 5. The " Brazilian " proceeded with the " Campanil " in tow, but owing to the two vessels being laden, and to the small power of the " Brazilian," she was only able to make very slow progress with the " Campanil," and it was not until 6.30 p.m. of the said day that the " Brazilian " arrived at Vigo with the " Campanil," which then came to anchor off the town there. 6. The defendants on the day of tendered to the plaintiffs and have paid into court the sum of 350/. for the services so as aforesaid rendered to the " Campanil " and her said cargo and freight, and offered to pay the costs, and submit that the same is ample and sufficient. [Title.] Reply. 1. The plaintiffs admit the first and second articles of the Answer, and they admit that the " Brazilian " came into collision with the " Campanil," and caused slight damage to the " Campanil," but save as aforesaid they join issue upon the statement of defence.

Land. In the High Court of Justice, Division. Writ issued 3d August 1876. Between A.B. ----- Plaintiff, and E.F. ----- Defendant.

Claim. Statement of Claim. 1. The plaintiff was on the 5th March 1876 and still is the owner and occupier of a farm called Highfield Farm, in the parish of and county of 2. A private road, known as Highfield Lane, runs through a portion of the plaintiff's farm. It is bounded upon both sides by fields of the plaintiff's, and is separated therefrom by a hedge and ditch. 3. For a long time prior to the 5th March 1876 the defendant had wrongfully claimed to use the said road for his horses and carriages on the alleged ground that the same was a public highway, and the plaintiff had frequently warned him that the same was not a public highway, but the plaintiff's private road, and that the defendant must not so use it. 4. On the 5th March 1876 the defendant came with a cart and horse, and a large number of servants and workmen, and forcibly used the road, and broke down and removed a gate which the plaintiff had caused to be placed across the same. 5. The defendant and his servants and workmen on the same occasion pulled down and damaged the plaintiff's hedge and ditch upon each side of the road, and went upon the plaintiff's field beyond the hedge and ditch, and injured the crops there growing, and dug up and injured the soil of the road; and in any case the acts mentioned in this paragraph were wholly unnecessary for the assertion of the defendant's alleged right to use, or the user of the said road as a highway. The plaintiff claims: 1. Damages for the wrongs complained of. 2. An injunction restraining the defendant from any repetition of any of the acts complained of. 3. Such further relief as the nature of the case may require.

Defence. [Title.] Statement of Defence. 1. The defendant says that the road was and is a public highway for horses and carriages; and a few days before the 5th March 1876 the

1875. Supreme Cov/rt of Judicature Act (1873) Amt. Ch. 77.

plaintiff wrongfully erected the gate across the road for the purpose of obstructing and preventing, and it did obstruct and prevent the use of the road as a highway. And the defendant on the said 5th March 1876 caused the said gate to be removed, in order to enable him lawfully to use the road by his horses and carriages as a highway.

2. The defendant denies the allegations of the fifth paragraph of the statement of claim, and says that neither he nor any of his workmen or servants did any act, or used any violence other than was necessary to enable the plaintiff lawfully to use the highway.

in the first schedule to this Act, to any person having power under an Act of Parliament or otherwise to borrow for such purpose.

The Loan Commissioners in considering the propriety of granting a loan shall have regard to the sufficiency of the security for its repayment, and, subject to the provisions of any special Act, shall determine whether the work for which the loan is asked would be such a benefit to the public as to justify a loan out of public money, having regard to the amount of money placed at their disposal by Parliament.

10. Every loan granted under this Act shall bear interest Interest on at a rate not less than the rate authorised by a special Act loan' relating to such loan, or if no rate be so authorised, not less

&c. Act, 1861," exceeds one hundred thousand pounds, the rate of interest on such excess shall be three and a half per cent., or such higher rate, not exceeding five per cent.,' as may in the judgment of the Treasury be necessary to enable the loan to be made without loss to the Exchequer.

The Loan Commissioners in considering whether the period for the repayment of a loan should or should not be the said full period, and the Loan Commissioners and the Treasury in

Preliminary.

2. This Act, except so far as it authorises any rules to be made or other thing to be done at any time after the passing of this Act, shall come into operation on the first day of September one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five.

Part 1.

Jurisdiction—Jurisdiction of County Court

3, In any proceeding before a county court in relation to any dispute between an employer and a workman arising out of or incidental to their relation as such (which dispute is herein-after referred to as a dispute under this Act) the court may, in addition to any jurisdiction it might have exercised if this Act had not passed, exercise all or any of the following powers; that is to say,

(1.) It may adjust and set off the one against the other all such claims on the part either of the employer or of the workman, arising out of or incidental to the relation between them, as the court may find to

Ch. 90.

1017

Employers and Workmen.

be subsisting, whether such claims are liquidated or unliquidated, and are for wages, damages, or otherwise; and,

(2.) If, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it thinks it just to do so, it may rescind any contract between the employer and the workman upon such terms as to the apportionment of wages or other sums due thereunder, and as to the payment of wages or damages, or other sums due, as it thinks just; and, (3.) Where the court might otherwise award damages for any breach of contract it may, if the defendant be willing to give security to the satisfaction of the court for the performance by him of so much of his contract as remains unperformed, with the consent of the plaintiff, accept such security, and order performance of the contract accordingly, in place either of the whole of the damages which would otherwise have been awarded, or some part of such damages. The security shall be an undertaking by the defendant and one or more surety or sureties that the defendant will perform his contract, subject on non-performance to the payment of a sum to be specified in the undertaking.

Any sum paid by a surety on behalf of a defendant in respect of a security under this Act, together with all costs incurred by such surety in respect of such security, shall be deemed to be a debt due to him from the defendant; and where such security has been given in or under the direction of a court of summary jurisdiction, that court may order payment to the surety of the sum which has so become due to him from the defendant.

Court of Summary Jurisdiction.

4. A dispute under this Act between an employer and a workman may be heard and determined by a court of summary jurisdiction, and such court, for the purposes of this Act, shall be deemed to be a court of civil jurisdiction, and in a proceeding in relation to any such dispute the court may order payment of any sum which it may find to be due as wages, or damages, or otherwise, and may exercise all or any of the powers by this Act conferred on a county court: Provided that in any proceeding in relation to any such dispute the court of summary jurisdiction—

(1.) Shall not exercise any jurisdiction where the amount claimed exceeds ten pounds; and (2.) Shall not make an order for the payment of any sum exceeding ten pounds, exclusive of the costs incurred in the case; and (3.) Shall not require security to an amount exceeding ten pounds from any defendant or his surety or sureties.

5. Any dispute between an apprentice to whom this Act applies and his master, arising out of or incidental to their relation as such, (which dispute is herein-after referred to as a dispute under this Act,) may be heard and determined by a court of summary jurisdiction.

6. In a proceeding before a court of summary jurisdiction in relation to a dispute under this Act between a master and an apprentice, the court shall have the same powers as if the dispute were between an employer and a workman, and the master were the employer and the apprentice the workman, and the instrument of apprenticeship a contract between an employer and a workman, and shall also have the following powers:

(1.) It may make an order directing the apprentice to perform his duties under the apprenticeship; and

(2.) If it rescinds the instrument of apprenticeship it m ay if it thinks it just so to do, order the whole or an part of the premium paid on the binding of th apprentice to be repaid.

Where an order is made directing an apprentice to perform his duties under the apprenticeship, the court may, from time to time, if satisfied after the expiration of not less than one month from the date of the order that the apprentice has failed to comply therewith, order him to be imprisoned for a period not exceeding fourteen days.

7. In a proceeding before a court of summary jurisdiction in relation to a dispute under this Act between a master and an apprentice, if there is any person liable, under the instrument of apprenticeship, for the good conduct of the apprentice, that person may, if the court so direct, be summoned in like manner as if he were the defendant in such proceeding to attend on the hearing of the proceeding, and the court may, in addition to or in substitution for any order which the court is authorised to make against the apprentice, order the person so summoned to pay damages for any breach of the contract of apprenticeship to an amount not exceeding the limit (if any) to which he is liable under the instrument of apprenticeship.

The court may, if the person so summoned, or any other person, is willing to give security to the satisfaction of the court for the performance by the apprentice of his contract of apprenticeship, accept such security instead of or in mitigation of any punishment which it is authorised to inflict upon the apprentice.

The Lord Chancellor may at any time after the passing of this Act, and from time to time make, and when made, rescind, alter, and add to, rules for carrying into effect the jurisdiction by this Act given to a court of summary jurisdiction, and in particular for the purpose of regulating the costs of any proceedings in a court of summary jurisdiction, with power to provide that the same shall not exceed the costs which would in a similar case be incurred in a county court, and any rules so made in so far as they relate to the exercise of jurisdiction

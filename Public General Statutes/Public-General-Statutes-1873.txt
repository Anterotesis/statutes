[24th April 1873.]

WHEREAS it is judged necessary for the safety of the United Kingdom, and the defence of the possessions of this realm, that a body of Royal Marine forces should be employed in Her Majesty's fleet and naval service, under the direction of the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom, or the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid: And whereas the said forces may frequently be quartered or be on shore, or sent to do duty or be on board transport ships or merchant ships or vessels, or ships or vessels of Her Majesty, or other ships or vessels, or they maybe under other circumstances in which they will not be subject to the laws relating to the government of Her Majesty's forces by sea: And whereas no man can be forejudged of life or limb, or subjected in time of peace to any kind of punishment within this realm, by martial law, or in any other manner than by the judgment of his peers, and according to the known and established laws of this realm; yet nevertheless it being requisite for the retaining of such forces in their duty that an exact discipline be observed, and that marines who shall mutiny or stir up sedition, or shall desert Her Majesty's service, or be guilty of any other crime or offence in breach of or to the prejudice of good order and discipline, be brought to a more exemplary and speedy punishment than the usual forms of the law will allow:

[16th June 1873.]

WHEREAS the church or chapel known as Saint John the Evangelist, in the parish of Eton, in the county of Buckingham and diocese of Oxford, was, on the first day of June one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, duly consecrated for the performance of Divine Service, but no authority has ever been given by the Bishop of the said diocese, or otherwise, for the publication of banns and solemnization of marriages therein:

And whereas divers marriages have nevertheless been solemnized in the said church or chapel, under an erroneous impression on the part of the ministers thereof, that by virtue of the consecration of the said church or chapel or otherwise, marriages might be lawfully solemnized therein; and entries of the said marriages so solemnized have from time to time been made in the register books kept either at the said church or chapel, or at the collegiate and parish church of Eton aforesaid:

And whereas it is expedient under the circumstances aforesaid to remove all doubts touching the validity of the marriages so solemnized in the said church or chapel:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

2. No minister who has solemnized any of the said marriages shall be liable to any ecclesiastical censures, or to any other proceedings or penalties whatsoever, by reason of his having so solemnized the same respectively.

CHAPTER 40.

An Act to authorise the acquisition and appropriation by the Metropolitan Board of Works of certain land reclaimed from the River Thames in pursuance of the Thames Embankment Act, 1862.

[21st July 1873.]

WHEREAS in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two a scheme was submitted to Parliament for the embankment of a part of the northern shore of the river Thames, and such scheme was carried into effect by the Thames Embankment Act, 1862:

And whereas in and previously to the said year, by virtue of the Thames Conservancy Act, 1857, and an arrangement made between the Crown and the corporation of the city of London, after a protracted litigation as to the title to the soil and foreshore of the river Thames below Teddington Lock, such soil and foreshore was appropriated as follows; that is to say, all such parts of such soil and foreshore as were opposite to land belonging to or in possession of the Crown or any department of the Government, and in this Act called the reserved land, were reserved to the Crown, and the residue of such soil and foreshore (in this Act called the conservancy land) was vested in the Conservators of the river Thames for all the estate and interest of the Crown and the said Corporation therein, subject to an obligation on the part of the Conservators to pay to the Crown one third part of all moneys that might be received by them in respect of such conservancy land:

And whereas in and previously to the said year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two the Crown was also possessed of valuable water frontage, wharfage, and other rights (in this Act called "frontage rights") on the northern shore of the river Thames between Westminster and Blackfriars bridges: And whereas it was necessary for the purposes of the Thames Embankment Act, 1862, that a portion of the reserved land, consisting of about five and a half acres, and the said frontage rights of the Crown, and also a portion of the conservancy land, should be taken or interfered with by the Metropolitan Board of Works, by whom the said Embankment Act was carried into execution:

Thames Embankment (Land).

Ch. 40.

And whereas by that Act provision was made for referring to arbitration the value of the joint interest of the Conservators and of the Crown in the said portion of the conservancy land, and such arbitration having taken place the amount awarded was paid by the Metropolitan Board of Works to the Conservators, of which amount one third part was afterwards duly paid to the Crown:

And whereas the reserved land, after deducting the said five and a half acres of land so as aforesaid taken by the Metropolitan Board of Works, is in this Act called the residuary reserved land:

And whereas in the course of the proceedings preliminary or incidental to the passing of the said Act it was proposed that, regard being had to the greatly increased value which would accrue by reclamation to the residuary reserved land, no compensation should be paid to the Crown for the relinquishment by it of such part of the reserved land and frontage rights as was required to be taken or interfered with by the Metropolitan Board of Works for the construction of the Thames Embankment and roadway; and such proposal was carried into effect by the Thames Embankment Act, 1862, whereby it was provided that the residuary reserved land when reclaimed should continue vested in the Crown, and that no money compensation should be paid by the Metropolitan Board of Works to the Crown for the part of such reserved land and the frontage rights belonging to the Crown which would be taken or interfered with by the said Board in the construction of the said embankment and roadway:

And whereas it is expedient that power should be given to the Metropolitan Board of Works to acquire a portion of the said residuary reserved land (in this Act called the red land) containing about seven thousand three hundred square yards, and situate adjacent to the gardens of Fife House, Whitehall, and coloured red, and more particularly described on a plan (in this Act called the deposited plan) which, having been marked with the letter A and signed by one of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues, has been deposited at the Office of Land Revenue Records and Inrolments:

And whereas the land coloured blue on the deposited plan, containing about one thousand and sixty square yards, is now vested in the Metropolitan Board of Works subject to the provisions of the Thames Embankment Act, 1862, and the Thames Embankment (North and South) Act, 1868:

And whereas under the provisions of section fifty-three of the Thames Embankment Act, 1862, no building (except as in the said Act mentioned) can be erected on the said land coloured blue without the previous consent in writing of the Most Noble Algernon Duke of Northumberland, his heirs, sequels in estate, or assigns:

And whereas the Metropolitan Board of Works are promoting in the present session of Parliament a Bill, under the title of the Charing Cross and Victoria Embankment Approach Bill, by which it is proposed that power be given to such Board to acquire Northumberland House and other property of the said Duke, in respect of which his consent to the erection of buildings on the said land coloured blue is so required as aforesaid:

And whereas for facilitating the acquisition by the Metropolitan Board of Works of the red land, and the formation of a garden for the recreation and enjoyment of the public, having a uniform breadth from the roadway on the Embankment, certain negotiations have taken place, and the heads of arrangement set forth in the schedule to this Act were adjusted as proper to be recommended for the consideration of Parliament:

And whereas it is expedient that the said heads of arrangement should be adopted, and the provisions thereof be carried out under the sanction of Parliament:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as The Thames Embankment Land Act, 1873.

2.

3. The land in the said heads of arrangement mentioned as coloured blue shall, when conveyed to the Crown, be held freed and discharged from all the provisions of the Thames Embankment Act, 1862, and the Thames Embankment (North and South) Act, 1868.

4. All lands acquired by the Metropolitan Board of Works in pursuance of this Act shall be appropriated for the purposes of a public garden, and shall be maintained by them as such; and section four of the Thames Embankment (North) Act, 1872, enabling the Metropolitan Board of Works to make byelaws, shall extend and apply to the lands to be appropriated by them as aforesaid for the purposes of a public garden: Provided always, that no portion of such public garden shall

5. The Metropolitan Board of Works may, notwithstanding any limit contained in any Act of Parliament, borrow on the credit of the consolidated rate leviable by the said Board a sufficient sum of money to pay the price of the red land and may create and issue a sufficient amount of consolidated stock of the said Board for the purpose of raising such sum of money; and all other expenses incurred by them under this Act shall be deemed to be expenses properly incurred by them in the execution of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and shall be defrayed accordingly.

1. These heads of arrangement are not of themselves to have any force or validity, but they embody the terms which, in the opinion of the above-named Charles Alexander Gore, on behalf of the Crown, and of the Board, may properly be submitted for the consideration of Parliament as a settlement which, in the interest of the public, may be'^ advantageously made in regard to the matter which is the subject of the arrangement.

2. The arrangement is only to take effect in the event of the Board being authorised by Parliament in the present session to acquire, and thereafter duly acquiring, Northumberland House and certain other property of the Most Noble Algernon Duke of Northumberland which is scheduled in the book of reference to the Charing Cross and Victoria Embankment Approach Bill now before Parliament.

3. For the considerations herein-after mentioned, the said Charles Alexander Gore, or the Commissioner or Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues for the time being (having the management of the property), are or is to convey, subject to the interest of the Metropolitan District Railway Company in a small portion thereof, to the Board the land near the gardens of Fife House, Whitehall, and containing 7, 300 square yards, or thereabouts, which is coloured red on a plan signed by the said Charles Alexander Gore, and deposited at the Office of Land Revenue Records and Inrolments, here in-after called the deposited plan. Such land is herein-after called the " red land."

4. The red land when conveyed to the Board shall, within six months after the same is acquired by them, be formed and laid out, and shall for ever thereafter be maintained by the Board as an ornamental public garden, with lawns, gravel walks, flower beds, and shrubberies, the surface of the soil not being in any place more than

six feet above the level of the existing foot pavement of the Embankment roadway, and no building or erection shall at any time be placed on the red land.

5. In lieu of the wall or fence which by section 72 of the Thames Embankment Act, 1862, the Board are to erect between the red land and the roadway on the Embankment, the Board will construct and maintain between the red land and the adjoining garden, in the occupation of Lord Gage, a proper closed fence, not less than 8 feet in height above the surface of the public garden adjoining such fence, standing on a kerb wall, and being supported by iron railings.

6. As the consideration for the red land, the Board, after it shall have acquired Northumberland House, but not before, is to convey to the Crown, free from all the provisions of the Thames Embankment Act, 1862, and the Thames Embankment (North and South) Act, 1868, certain land at the north-west corner of the red land, containing 1, 060 square yards, -or thereabouts, and coloured blue on the deposited plan. The said land so coloured blue is herein-after called the blue land. And the Board is also to pay to the Crown the sum of £3, 270.

The general line of frontage of the main building or buildings to be erected on the blue land (when conveyed to the Crown), and on the Crown land on the westward side of the red land, shall not be nearer to the line of the terrace wall shown on the deposited plan than 30 feet, and the intervening space between any buildings which may be erected on the blue land or on the said Crown land shall be separated from the public garden on the red land and on the land to the eastward of the blue land by a terrace wall of an ornamental character (of which the design is to be approved by the Board). And such terrace wall shall be erected on the site marked terrace wall on the deposited plan, and the said terrace wall shall not be more than 15 feet in height (exclusive of the balustrade thereon) above the pavement of the footway on the Embankment roadway, and no openings for light or means of access to the public garden shall be made in such terrace wall.

CHAPTER 59.

An Act for regulating and extending the Jurisdiction in matters connected with the Slave Trade of the Vice-Admiralty Court at Aden, and of Her Majesty's Consuls under Treaties with the Sovereigns of Zanzibar, Muscat, and Madagascar, and under future Treaties.

[5th August 1873.]

WHEREAS treaties for the more effectual suppression of the slave trade have been made by or on behalf of Her Majesty with chiefs or states in Arabia, and on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and on the east coast of Africa, and in the islands of Madagascar and Zanzibar, and the Comoro islands: And whereas by the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1843, it was among other things enacted " that it is and shall be lawful " for Her Majesty to hold, exercise, and enjoy any power or

" jurisdiction which Her Majesty now hath or may at any " time hereafter have within any country or place out of Her

" Majesty's dominions in the same and as ample a manner as " if Her Majesty had acquired such power or jurisdiction by " the cession or conquest of territory

And whereas by various treaties Her Majesty is empowered to exercise jurisdiction within the dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, the Imaum of Muscat, and the Sovereign of Madagascar, in regard to vessels captured on suspicion of being engaged in the slave trade:

And whereas by an Order in Council relating to the dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, and dated the ninth day of August one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six, and another Order in Council relating to the dominions of the Imaum of Muscat, and dated the fourth day of November one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, and a third Order in Council relating to the dominions of the Sovereign of Madagascar, and dated the fourth day of February one thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine, it was in each case ordered that Her Majesty's consul within the dominions to which the order relates should, for and within the said dominions, and in regard to vessels captured on suspicion of being engaged in the slave trade within those dominions, have all such jurisdiction as for the time being ordinarily belongs to courts of vice-admiralty in Her Majesty's possessions abroad:

And whereas a vice-admiralty court has been established at Aden, but has only a limited jurisdiction in matters relating to the slave trade:

And whereas by " The Slave Trade Jurisdiction (Zanzibar) 32 & 33 Vict Act, 1869," provision was made for the exercise of the said c- 75; jurisdiction by Her Majesty's consul within the dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar:

And whereas it is expedient to make further provision for the exercise of the said jurisdiction by Her Majesty's consuls within the dominions of the Sovereigns of Zanzibar, Muscat, and Madagascar, and for the exercise of jurisdiction in matters relating to the slave trade by the Vice-Admiralty Court at Aden:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

(2.) Where the vessel seized has been seized in pursuance of any existing East African slave trade treaty; and

(3.) Where the vessel seized is not shown to the court to be entitled to claim the protection of the flag of any foreign state.

Each of the East African courts shall have the same jurisdiction in regard to any person who has been seized either at sea or land, on the ground that he has or is suspected to have been detained as a slave, for the purpose of the slave trade, as the court would have under this section if he had been so detained on board a vessel that was seized and brought in for adjudication.

All jurisdiction exercised under this section shall for the purposes of any such Act as above mentioned be deemed to be exercised in pursuance of that Act.

4. The provisions of the Vice-Admiralty Courts Act, 18G3, with respect to appeals to Her Majesty in Council from any decree or order of a Vice-Admiralty Court shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to appeals from any decree or order of the East African courts made or purporting to be made in the exercise of their jurisdiction under this Act

And whereas by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act, 1840, all «the estate and interest which the holder of any deanery had in any lands or endowments whatsoever annexed to such deanery, and enjoyed by the holder of such deanery separately and in addition to his share of the corporate revenues of the chapter, were, after the next avoidance of such deanery, vested in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England:

And whereas it is provided by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act, 1850, to the effect that no dean of any cathedral or collegiate church appointed after the tenth of April one thousand eight hundred and fifty should hold with his deanery any benefice not situate within the city or town of the cathedral or collegiate church in which he was dean:

And whereas the rectory of Tatenhill is not situate within the city of Lichfield:

And whereas the Ecclesiastical Commissioners are required by an Order in Council, dated the fifteenth day of June one thousand eight hundred and fifty-two, and made in pursuance of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act, 1840, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act, 1841, to pay out of their common fund annual sums in order to make up the average annual receipts of the dean of Lichfield from the divisible corporate revenues of the chapter of Lichfield to an income of one thousand pounds:

And whereas it has been decided by the Court of Common Pleas that the above-recited enactments of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act, 1840, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act, 1850, do not extend to the rectory of Tatenhill, with its lands and endowments, and it is expedient so to extend the same and to sever the said rectory from the deanery of Lichfield:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1, Upon the avoidance of the deanery of Lichfield which happens next after the passing of this Act, the provisions of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act, 1840/and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act, 1850, and the enactments amending the same, shall apply to the lands and endowments of the rectory

2. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England (in this Scheme for Act referred to as the Commissioners), with the consent in carrying seve-writing of two of the Commissioners erf Her Majesty's Treasury mt0 and of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for the time

being on behalf of Her Majesty, may from time to time lay before Her Majesty in Council schemes for carrying into effect this Act and making the arrangements consequential on the severance of the rectory of Tatenhill from the deanery of Lichfield, and for making out of the lands and endowments of such rectory proper provision for the spiritual duties thereof, and of any new ecclesiastical parish or district formed either before or after the passing of this Act either wholly or partially out of the parish of Tatenhill, and for transferring to the incumbent of such rectory or new ecclesiastical parish any property for the purpose of the endowment thereof, and for making such incidental provisions as may be necessary for carrying into effect any of the above-mentioned objects, so nevertheless that the glebe and tithes of the said rectory shall be applied for the benefit of the said parish of Tatenhill and the ecclesiastical districts formed or to be formed out of such parish.

Such scheme may also, with the consent in writing of the person who is dean of Lichfield at the passing of this Act, direct that the provisions of such scheme, or any of them, and the severance of the rectory from the deanery, shall take effect either wholly or partly at any earlier date than the next avoidance of such deanery, and may provide for the same so taking effect upon the terms and conditions contained in the scheme, and the same shall accordingly take effect as if the deanery had been avoided; but save as aforesaid, b. scheme under this section shall not have any effect until the avoidance of the deanery of Lichfield which happens next after the passing of this Act.

3. Whereas by section fifty-one of the Ecclesiastical Com-Repeal of part missioners Act, 1840, certain provisions were made with

respect to prebends, dignities, and offices in cathedral churches Ecclesiastical in England, subject to the following proviso: Provided always, Commissioners that nothing herein contained shall in any manner apply to Act> 1840* or affect any dignity, office, or prebend which is permanently annexed to any bishopric, archdeaconry, professorship, or lectureship, or to any school or the mastership thereof, or the prebends of Burgham, Bursalis, Exceit, and Wyndham in the

Rules of Procedure.

Form of Action.

1. All actions which have hitherto been commenced by writ in the Superior Courts of Common Law at Westminster, or in the Court of Common Pleas at Lancaster, or in the Court of Pleas at Durham, and all suits which have hitherto been commenced by bill or information in the High Court of Chancery, or by a cause in rem or in personam in the High Court of Admiralty, or by citation or otherwise in the Court of Probate, shall be instituted in the High Court of Justice by a proceeding to be called an action.

All other proceedings in and applications to the High Court may, subject to Rules of Court, be taken and made in the same manner as they would have been taken and made in any Court in which any proceeding or application of the like kind could have been taken or made if this Act had not passed.

Writ of Summons.

2. Every action in the High Court shall be commenced by a writ of summons, which shall be endorsed with a statement of the nature of the claim made, or of the relief or remedy required in the action, and which shall specify the Division of the High Court to which it is intended that the action should be assigned.

3. Forms of writs and of endorsements thereon applicable to the several ordinary causes of action, shall be prescribed by Rules of Court, and any costs incurred by the use of any more prolix or other forms shall be borne by the party using the same, unless the Court shall otherwise direct.

4. No service of writ shall be required when the defendant, by his solicitor, agrees to accept service, and enters an appearance.

5. When service is required the writ shall, wherever it is practicable, be served in the manner in which personal service is now made, but if it be made to appear to the Court or to a Judge that the

plaintiff is from any cause unable to effect prompt personal service, the Court or Judge may make such order for substituted or other service, or for the substitution of notice for service, as may seem just.

6. Whenever it appears fit to the Court or to a Judge in a case in Service out of which the cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction, or is thejumdlctl011' properly cognizable against a defendant within the jurisdiction, that

any person out of the jurisdiction of the Court should be served with the writ or other process of the Court, the Court or Judge may order such service, or such notice in lieu of service, to be made or given in such manner and on such terms as may seem just.

7. In all actions where the plaintiff seeks merely to recover a debt Special endorse-or liquidated demand in money, payable by the defendant, with or S^of°deSuor without interest, arising upon a contract, express or implied, as, for Uquidated instance, on a bill of exchange, promissory note, cheque, or other

simple contract debt, or on a bond or contract under seal for payment of a liquidated amount of money, or on a statute where the sum sought to be recovered is a fixed sum of money or in the nature of a See c. L. P. Act, debt, or on a guaranty, whether under seal or not, where the claim 1852, 8S'*7' against the principal is in respect of such debt or liquidated demand, bill, cheque, or note, or on a trust, the writ of summons may be specially endorsed with the particulars of the amount sought to be recovered, after giving credit for any payment or set-off.

Where the defendant appears on a writ of summons so specially endorsed, the plaintiff may, on affidavit verifying the cause of action, and swearing that in his belief there is no defence to the action, call on the defendant to show cause before the Court or a Judge why the plaintiff should not be at liberty to sign final judgment for the amount so endorsed, together with interest, if any, and costs; and the Court or Judge may, unless the defendant, by affidavit or otherwise, satisfy the Court or Judge that he has a good defence to the action on the merits, or disclose such facts as the Court or Judge may think sufficient to entitle him to be permitted to defend the action, make an order empowering the plaintiff to sign judgment accordingly.

Permission to defend the action may be granted to the defendant on such terms*and conditions, if any, as the Judge or Court may think just.

No person shall be added as a plaintiff sueing without a next friend, or as the next friend of a plaintiff under any disability, without his own consent thereto.

or indemnity, or any other remedy or relief over against any other person, or where from any other cause it appears to the Court or a Judge that a question in the action should be determined not only as between the plaintiff and defendant, but as between the plaintiff, defendant, and any other person, or between any or either of them, the Court or a Judge may on notice being given to such last-mentioned person, in such manner and form as may be prescribed by Rules of Court, make such order as may be proper for having the question so determined. w

15. Married women and infants may respectively sue as plaintiffs by their next friends, in the manner practised in the Court of Chance iy before the passing of this Act; and infants may, in like manner, defend any action by their guardians appointed for that purpose.

17. An action shall not become abated by reason of the marriage, death, or bankruptcy of any of the parties, if the cause of action survive or continue, and shall not become defective by the assignment, creation, or devolution of any estate or title pendente lite.

In case of the marriage, death, or bankruptcy, or devolution of estate by operation of law, of any party to an action, the Court or a Judge may, if it be deemed necessary for the complete settlement of all the questions involved in the action, order that the husband, personal representative, trustee, or other successor in interest, if any, of such party be made a party to the action, or be served with notice thereof in such manner and form as may be prescribed by Rules of Court, and on such terms as the Court or Judge shall think just, and shall make such order for the disposal of the action as may be just.

In case of an assignment, creation, or devolution of any estate or title pendente lite, the action may be continued by or against the person to or upon whom such estate or title has come or devolved.

Pleadings.

18. The following rules of pleading shall be substituted for those heretofore used in the High Court of Chancery and in the Courts of Common Law, Admiralty, and Probate.

Unless the defendant at the time of his appearance shall state that he does not require the delivery of a statement of complaint, the plaintiff shall within such time and in such manner as shall be prescribed by Rules of Court, file and deliver to the defendant after his appearance a printed statement of his complaint, and of the relief or remedy to which he claims to be entitled. The defendant shall within such time and in such manner as aforesaid file and deliver to the plaintiff a printed statement of his defence, set-off, or counter-claim (if any), and the plaintiff shall in like manner file and deliver a printed statement of his reply (if any) to such defence, set-off, or counter-claim. Such statements shall be as brief as the nature of the case will admit, and the Court in adjusting the costs of the action shall inquire at the instance of any party into any unnecessary prolixity and order the costs occasioned by such prolixity to be borne by the party chargeable with the same.

A demurrer to any statement may be filed in such manner and form as may be prescribed by Rules of Court.

The Court or a Judge may, at any stage of the proceedings, allow either party to alter his statement of claim or defence or reply, or may order to be struck out or amended any matter in such statements respectively which may be scandalous, or which may tend to prejudice, embarrass, or delay the fair trial of the action, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions or question in controversy between the parties.

19. Where in any action it appears to a Judge that the statement of claim or defence or reply does not sufficiently disclose the issues of fact in dispute between the parties, he may direct the parties to prepare issues, and such issues shall, if the parties differ, be settled by the Judge.

20. A defendant may set off, or set up, by way of counter-claim against the claims of the plaintiff, any right or claim, whether such set-off or counter-claim sound in damages or not, and such set-off or counter-claim shall have the same effect as a statement of claim in a cross action, so as to enable the Court to pronounce a final judgment in the same action, both on the original and on the cross claim. But the Court or a Judge may, on the application of the plaintiff before trial, if in the opinion of the Court or Judge such set-off or counterclaim cannot be conveniently disposed of in the pending action, or ought not to be allowed, refuse permission to the defendant to avail himself thereof.

21. Where in any action a set-off or counter-claim is established as a defence against the plaintiff's claim, the Court may, if the balance is in favour of the defendant, give judgment for the defendant for such balance, or may otherwise adjudge to the defendant such relief as he may be entitled to upon the merits of the case.

22. Subject to any Rules of Court, the plaintiff may unite in the same action and in the same statement of claim several causes of action, but if it appear to the Court or a Judge that any such causes of action cannot be conveniently tried or disposed of together, the Court or Judge may order separate trials of any of such causes of action to be had, or may make such other order as may be necessary or expedient for the separate disposal thereof.

23. It shall not be necessary that every defendant to any action shall be interested as to all the relief thereby prayed for, or as to every cause of action included therein; but the Court or a Judge may make such order as may appear just to prevent any defendant from being embarrassed or put to expense by being required to attend any proceedings in such action in which he may have no interest.

24. If it appear to the Court or a Judge, either from the statement of claim or defence or reply or otherwise, that there is in any action a question of law, which it would be convenient to have decided before any evidence is given or any question or issue of fact is tried, or before any reference is made to a referee or an arbitrator, the Court or Judge may make an order accordingly, and may direct such question of law to be raised for the opinion of the Court, either by special case or in such other manner as the Court or Judge may deem expedient, or as may be prescribed by Rules of Court, and all such further proceedings as the decision of such question of law may render unnecessary may thereupon be stayed.

The Court in adjusting the costs of the action shall at the instance of any party inquire or cause inquiry to be made into the propriety of exhibiting such interrogatories, and if it is the opinion of the taxing master or of the Court or Judge that such interrogatories have been exhibited unreasonably, vexatiously, or at improper length, the costs occasioned by the said interrogatories and the answers thereto shall be borne by the party in fault.

27. It shall be lawful for the Court or a Judge at any time during to

the pendency therein of any action or proceeding, to order the pro- 001101611 duction by any party thereto, upon oath, of such of the documents

in his possession or power, relating to any matter in question in such suit or proceeding, as the Court or Judge shall think right; and the Court may deal with such documents, when produced, in such manner as shall appear just.

rised to raise for the purposes of the said Acts any sum or sums of money not exceeding in the whole eight million

whereas the purposes of the Telegraph Acts, 1868 to 1870, were the purchasing, working, maintaining, and extending telegraphs:

And whereas by the nineteenth section of the Telegraph Act, 1869, after declaring that the amount to be raised should be appropriated by the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt in such manner, and transferred to such parties as shall be directed by the Postmaster General for the purposes of the Telegraph Acts, under such regulations as shall be prescribed by the Treasury, it was further enacted that the gross revenue received by the Postmaster General for the transmission of messages by means of electric telegraphs shall be paid into the Exchequer to the account of the Consolidated Fund, and that the expenses incurred in working, maintaining, and extending telegraphs shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament:

And whereas a portion of the said amount of eight million pounds so raised as aforesaid has been expended upon certain extensions of telegraphs for the purpose of producing a greater uniformity in the working of the telegraphic and postal systems of the United Kingdom, and doubts have been entertained whether such expenditure was lawful, regard being had to the provisions of the nineteenth section of the said Telegraph Act,

1869, relating to the extension of telegraphs:

And whereas an estimated sum of about eight hundred and twelve thousand eight hundred pounds, part of the Post Office revenue which ought to have been paid into the Consolidated Fund, has been improperly expended for the purposes of the said Telegraph Acts, and it is necessary that funds should be provided to make good to the said Fund the sum so improperly diverted from it:

And whereas it is expedient to provide further funds for the purposes of the said Telegraph Acts, and of the Pensions Commutation Act, 1872:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. It is hereby declared that the said nineteenth section of Amendment of the Telegraph Act, 1869, in so far as the same relates to the Telegraph Act, expenses incurred in extending telegraphs, does not apply to

The provisions of the Telegraph Act, 1869, relating to the terminable annuities, three pounds per centum per annum capital stocks of annuities, or exchequer bills, or exchequer bonds, therein named, shall apply to the creation or issue, for the purposes of this Act, of any terminable annuities, any three per cent, capital stocks of annuities, exchequer bills, or exchequer bonds.

3. No part of the moneys raised in pursuance of this Act shall be applied to defray any charges in respect of telegraph extensions coming in course of payment on and after the first day of October one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three.

4. All moneys raised in pursuance of this Act shall be placed to the account of the Paymaster General at the Bank of England, and shall be issued from time to time under regulations to be made by the Treasury, and to be laid by them before Parliament; but in applying such moneys to meet the charges sanctioned by this Act regard shall be had to the several heads of expenditure in the schedule hereto, and no greater sum shall be applied to the expenditure under any one of such heads than is apportioned thereto in the said schedule, except with the sanction of the Treasury, to be given upon a certificate of the Postmaster General that the excess so proposed to be expended under any one head is compensated by a deficiency of expenditure under some other head, and that the total sum to be expended under this Act in carrying into effect the provisions thereof will not exceed the said sum of one million two hundred and fifty thousand pounds.

5. Accounts of all expenditure defrayed out of moneys raised in pursuance of the said Telegraph Acts, 1869 to 1871, and of this Act, shall be prepared by the Postmaster General in such form as may be approved by the Treasury, and be transmitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General, to be examined by him as if they were appropriation accounts, in manner directed by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 186G.

2. Whereas by the tenth section of " The Military Forces Localisation Act, 1872," it was enacted that the commissioners of lieutenancy of the city of London, the justices of any county, riding, division, or liberty of a county (in this section included under the term county), and the council of any municipal borough, may transfer to the said Secretary of State, for the purposes of this Act, upon such terras, and with or without payment of a pecuniary consideration, as they think expedient, any barracks, storehouses for arms or ammunition, or other buildings or land held in the case of a county for the public uses or purposes of such county, and in the case of a borough, for the public uses or purposes of such borough:

And whereas it is expedient in cases where the said Secretary of State does not require the transfer of any barrack, storehouse, or other building or land as aforesaid, to authorise the sale thereof in like manner as if the public service required the site of such storehouse to be changed: Be it therefore enacted, that upon a certificate' being given by the said Secretary of State that any such barrack, storehouse, or other building or land is not required for the purposes of the said Act, the said commissioners of lieutenancy, justices, or council may sell the

They may also in the like case make all such provisions and exercise all such powers with respect to the holding of examinations for the purpose of granting certificates of competency as masters, mates, or engineers, to persons desirous of obtaining the same, as might have been made or exercised by a local marine board.

Any person so appointed may, for the purposes of such survey, require the unloading or removal of any cargo, ballast, or tackle, and shall have all the powers of an inspector appointed under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854.

Any person who (having notice of the intention to hold such survey) wilfully does or causes to be done any act by which the person appointed to make such survey is prevented from or obstructed in ascertaining the condition of the ship, her equipments, machinery, and cargo, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds.

The Board of Trade may, if they think fit, order that any ship be detained for the purpose of being surveyed under this section, and thereupon any officer of customs may detain such ship until her release be ordered either by the Board of Trade or by any court to which an appeal is given under this Act.

Upon the receipt of the report of the person making any such survey, the Board may, if in their opinion the ship cannot proceed to sea without serious danger to human life, make such further order as they may think requisite as to the detention of the ship or as to her release, either absolutely or upon the performance of such conditions with respect to the execution of repairs or alterations, or the unloading or reloading of cargo, as the Board may impose. They may also from time to time vary or add to such order.

A copy of any such order and of the report upon which it was founded, and also of any variation of or addition to such order, shall be delivered as soon as possible to the owner or master of the ship to which it relates.

Where a complaint has been made to the Board of Trade that a ship is not fit to proceed to sea, they may, if they think tit, before ordering a survey of the ship, require the complainant to give or provide such security as they may think sufficient for the payment of the costs and expenses which they may incur in respect of the survey of the ship and of the compensation which they may be rendered liable to pay for loss or damage caused by her detention for the purpose of such survey, or otherwise in respect of such survey.

Where a ship has been surveyed under this Act in consequence of a complaint made to the Board of Trade, if upon v such survey being made it appear that such complaint was made without reasonable cause, the expenses incurred by the Board in respect of the survey of the ship and the amount, if any, which the Board may have been rendered liable to pay in respect of any loss or damage caused by her detention shall be recoverable by the Board from such complainant.

All moneys payable by the Board of Trade in respect or by reason of the survey or detention of a ship under this Act shall, subject to the right by this section provided of recovering such moneys from the complainant, be paid out of moneys to be provided by Parliament.

In England, to any court having Admiralty jurisdiction:

In Ireland, to any court having jurisdiction under the Court of Admiralty (Ireland) Act, 1867:

In Scotland, to the court of the sheriff of the county.

The court may, upon such application, if they think fit, appoint one or more competent persons to survey the ship anew, and any surveyor so appointed shall have all the powers of the person by whom the original survey was made. Such survey anew shall, if so required by the Board of Trade or the shipowner, be made in the presence of any person or persons appointed by them respectively to attend at the survey.

The court to which such application is made may make such order as to the detention or release of the ship, as to the

15. In the case of any ship surveyed under the fourth part of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, the Board of Trade may at the request of the owner authorise the reduction of the number and the variation of the dimensions of the boats required for the ship by section two hundred and ninety-two of that Act, and also the substitution of rafts or other appliances for saving life for any such boats, so nevertheless that the boats so reduced or varied and the rafts or other appliances so substituted be sufficient for the persons carried on board the ship.

Section two hundred and ninety-three of the said Act shall extend to any such rafts or appliances in the same manner as if they were boats.

16. In every case of collision between two vessels it shall be the duty of the master or person in charge of each vessel, if and so far as he can do so without danger to his own vessel, crew, and passengers (if any), to stay by the other vessel until he has ascertained that she has no need of further assistance, and to render to the other vessel, her master, crew, and passengers (if any), such assistance as may be practicable and as may be necessary in order to save them from any danger caused by the collision; and also to give to the master or person in charge of the other vessel the name of his own vessel, and of her port of registry, or of the port or place to which she belongs, and also the names of the ports and places from which and to which she is bound.

If he fails so to do, and no reasonable cause for such failure is shown, the collision shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be deemed to have been caused by his wrongful act, neglect, or default.

Every master or person in charge of a British vessel who fails, without reasonable cause, to render such assistance or give such information as aforesaid shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and if he is a certificated officer an inquiry into his conduct may be held, and his certificate may be cancelled or suspended.

17. If in any case of collision it is proved to the court before which the case is tried that any of the regulations for preventing collision contained in or made under the Merchant

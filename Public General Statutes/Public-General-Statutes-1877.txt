If any man while belonging to any regiment or corps of the regular, reserve, or auxiliary forces shall, without being discharged by the proper authorities therefrom, enlist or be enrolled or attempt to enlist or be enrolled in any regiment or corps, whether of the regular, reserve, or auxiliary forces, he shall be liable to be tried before a court-martial on a charge for desertion; but it shall be lawful for the Secretary of State for the War Department to give such general directions as may from time to time appear to him necessary for placing any man who confesses himself to be a militiaman under stoppage of one penny a day of his pay for eighteen calendar months, in lieu of his being tried by court-martial; and in the case of a militiaman who shall have belonged to the Militia Reserve at the time of his attestation for placing him under a further stoppage of one penny a day for two hundred and forty days, and further to give general directions as to the manner in which such stoppages shall be applied, and whether, on making good the same, the man shall be returned to his militia regiment or be deemed to be a soldier in the same manner as if he had not been a militiaman at the time of his attestation: Provided, that every soldier who while belonging to a militia regiment enlisted in Her Majesty's army, whether such enlistment took place before or after the passing of the Mutiny Act, 1860, shall reckon service towards the performance of his limited engagement from the date of his attestation: Provided also, that any such soldier shall not reckon service for pension until the day on which his engagement for the militia would have expired; but if any such soldier shall subsequently to his enlistment have rendered long, faithful, or gallant service, the Secretary of State for War may, upon the special recommendation of the Commander-in-Chief, order that he may reckon service for pension from the date of his attestation. If any noncommissioned officer of the Volunteer permanent staff enlists in Her Majesty's army he may be tried and punished as a deserter, but if he confesses his desertion the Secretary of State for the War Department, instead of causing him to be tried and punished as a deserter, may cause him to be returned to his service on the Volunteer permanent staff, to be there put under stoppages from his pay until he has repaid the amount of any bounty received by him and the expenses attending his enlistment, and also the value of any arms, &c. issued to him while on the Volunteer permanent staff, and not duly delivered up by him; or may cause him to be held to his service in Her Majesty's army, with a direction, if it seems fit, that his time of service therein shall not be reckoned for pension until the time when his engagement on the Volunteer permanent staff would have expired; and may further cause him to be

CHAPTER 8.

Her Maj esty

Royal

[24th April 1877.]

An Act for the Regulation of Marine Forces while on shore.

WHEREAS it is judged necessary for the safety of the United

Kingdom, and the defence of the possessions of this realm, that a body of Royal Marine forces should be employed in Her Majesty's fleet and naval service, under the direction of the Lord High Admiral of the. United Kingdom, or the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid:

And whereas the said forces may frequently be quartered or be on shore, or sent to do duty or be on board transport ships or merchant ships or vessels, or ships or vessels of Her Majesty, or other ships or vessels, or they may be under other circumstances in which they will not be subject to the laws relating to the government of Her Majesty's forces by sea:

And whereas no man can be forejudged of life or limb, or subjected in time of peace to any kind of punishment within this realm, by martial law, or in any other manner than by the judgment of his peers, and according to the known and established laws of this realm; yet nevertheless it being requisite for the retaining of such forces in their duty that an exact discipline be observed, and that marines who shall mutiny or stir up sedition, or shall desert Her Majesty's service, or be guilty of any other crime or offence in breach of or to the prejudice of good order and discipline, be brought to a more exemplary and speedy punishment than the usual forms of the law will allow:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and ' by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. It shall be lawful for the said Lord High Admiral, or the Com- p?^er to k°r(i missioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, &cgto^Seal, from time to time to make, ordain, alter, and establish rules and Articles for the Articles of War, under the hand of the said Lord High Admiral, or under the hands of any two or more of the said Commissioners, uon ^c. €SCr- for the better government of Her Majesty's Royal Marine forces, and for the punishment of mutiny, desertion, immorality, breach of discipline, misbehaviour, neglect of duty, and any other offence or misconduct of which they shall be guilty, in any place on shore or afloat in or out of Her Majesty's dominions, or at any time when or under any circumstances in which they shall not be amenable to the laws for the government of Her Majesty's ships, vessels, and forces by sea, and for regulating the proceedings of courts-martial, which rules and articles shall be judicially taken notice of by all judges and in all courts whatsoever; and copies of the same shall, as soon as conveniently may be after the same shall have been made, be transmitted by the Secretary of the Admiralty for the time being (certified under his hand) to the judges of Her Majesty's superior courts at Westminster, Dublin, and Edinburgh respectively, and also to the governors of Her Majesty's dominions abroad; provided that no person within the United Kingdom of Great Britain

and Ireland or within the British Isles shall by such Articles of War be subject to suffer any punishment extending to life or limb, or to be kept in penal servitude except for crimes which are by this Act expressly made liable to such punishment as aforesaid, or shall be subject, with reference to any crimes made punishable by this Act, to be punished in any manner which may be inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.

2. All crimes and offences committed against any former Act made for the regulation of the Royal Marine forces while on shore

anlf1 Articled of or aga^ns^ any the rules> regulations, or Articles of War made

and established by virtue of the same, may, during the continuance

of this Act, be tried, inquired of, and punished in like manner as if they had been committed against this Act; and every warrant for holding any court-martial under any former Act shall remain in full force notwithstanding the expiration of such Act; and all proceedings of any court-martial upon any trial begun under the authority of such former Act shall not be discontinued by the expiration of the same: Provided always, that no person shall be liable to be tried and punished for any offence against any of the said Acts or Articles of War which shall appear to have been committed more than three years before the date of the commission or warrant for such trial, unless the person accused, by reason of his having absented himself, or of some other manifest impediment, shall not have been amenable to justice within that period, in which case such person shall be liable to be tried at any time not exceeding two years after the impediment shall have ceased; and provided also, that if any officer or marine in any place beyond the seas shall commit any of the offences punishable by court-martial under this Act, and shall escape and come or be brought into this realm before he be tried for the same, he shall, when apprehended, be tried for the same as if such offence had been committed within this realm.

3. This Act shall extend to the islands of Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, and Man, and the islands thereto belonging, as to the provisions herein contained for enlisting of recruits, whether minors or of full age, and swearing and attesting such recruits, and for mustering and paying, and to the provisions for trial and punishment of officers and marines who shall be charged with mutiny and desertion or any other of the offences which are by this Act declared to be punishable by the sentence of a court-martial, and also to the provisions which relate to the punishment of persons who shall conceal deserters, or shall knowingly buy, exchange, or otherwise receive any arms, medals for good conduct or for distinguished or other service, clothes, military furniture, or regimental necessaries from any marine or deserter, or who shall cause the colour of any such clothes to be changed; and also to the provisions for exempting marines from being taken out of Her Majesty's service for not supportin ' or for leaving chargeable to any palish any wife or child or children, or on account of any breach of contract to serve or work for any employer, or on account of any debts under thirty pounds in the said islands.

Application of 4. All the provisions of the Act, and any Articles of War made

6. No person subject to this Act having been acquitted or convicted of any crime or offence by the civil magistrate or by the verdict of a jury shall be liable to be again tried for the same crime or offence by a court-martial, or to be punished for the same otherwise than by cashiering in the case of a commissioned officer, or in the case of a warrant officer by reduction to an inferior class, or to the rank of a private marine, by order of the Lord High Admiral, or the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral, or in the case of a non-commissioned officer, by reduction to the ranks, by order of the commandant of the division to which such non-commissioned officer may belong; and whenever any officer or marine shall have been tried before a court of ordinary criminal jurisdiction, the clerk of the court or other officer having the custody of the records of such court, or the deputy of such clerk, shall, if required by the officer commanding the division to which such officer or marine belongs, transmit to him a certi-

c? '

ficate containing the substance and effect only, omitting the formal part, of the indictment, conviction, and entry of judgment thereon or acquittal of such officer or marine, and shall be allowed for such certificate a fee of three shillings.

7. All of Her Majesty's Royal Marine forces shall, during the time they shall be respectively borne on the books of or be on board any of Her Majesty's ships or vessels in commission, either as part of the complement or as supernumeraries, or otherwise, be subject and liable in every respect to the laws for the government of Her Majesty's forces by sea and to the rules and discipline of the Royal Navy for the time being, and shall and may be proceeded against and punished for offences committed by them whilst so borne or on board, in the same manner as the officers and seamen employed in the Royal Navy may be tried or punished; except when and so long as any marine officers or marines shall be landed from any of Her Majesty's ships, and be employed in military operations on shore, and when on such occasions the senior naval officer present shall deem it expedient to issue an order declaring that such marine officers and marines shall during such employment on shore be subject to the regulations of this Act, in which cases, and while

95. All clauses and provisions in this Act contained relating to England shall be construed to extend to Wales and to the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed; and the provisions of this Act shall apply to all persons who are or shall be commissioned or in pay as an officer of Royal Marines, or who are or shall be listed or in pay as

An Act to authorise the continuance of the Charge heretofore payable on certain Offices, Annuities, Pensions, and Allowances. [17th May 1877.]

WHEREAS by or in pursuance of the Acts mentioned in the

Schedule hereto, or some of them, duties of one shilling and of sixpence and of four shillings in the pound are payable in respect of certain salaries, pensions, or allowances, and such duties have, where such salaries, pensions, and allowances are charged on public revenue, been deducted before payment is made of such salaries, pensions, or allowances, but in other cases have been assessed by the Commissioners of Land Tax before they become payable:

And whereas doubts are entertained whether the repeal of the said Acts by the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 187G, has not extended, contrary to the intention of Parliament, to the duties so deducted in respect of salaries, pensions, and allowances charged on public revenue, as well as to the duties so assessed by the Commissioners of Land Tax:

Where the annual account herein-after mentioned of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt shows that in the year for which the said account is made up the gross amount of interest accrued from the securities standing in their names to the credit of the Post Office Savings Banks Fund exceeded the interest paid and credited during the year to depositors in pursuance of the Acts relating to Post Office Savings Banks, and the expenses, including a sum, to be determined by the Treasury, to provide against depreciation in the value of the securities, incurred during the year in the execution of those Acts, the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt shall, within three months after the date at which the said account is laid before Parliament, cause the amount of such surplus to be paid out of the Post Office Savings Banks Fund into the Exchequer in such manner as may from time to time be agreed on between the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury and the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt.

15. Whereas in pursuance of the Acts relating to Savings Banks the sums received from trustees of savings banks have been invested by the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt in securities in their names to the credit of "The Fund for the Banks

for Savings," and it is intended that where the interest accrued from such securities in any year is insufficient to meet the interest required by the said Acts to be paid and credited during that year to the said trustees, such deficiency should be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, and it is expedient to provide for the disposal of any surplus of the interest so accrued above the interest so paid and credited!: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Where the annual account herein-after mentioned of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt shows that in the year for which the said account is made up the gross amount of interest accrued from the securities standing in their names to the credit of the Fund for the Banks for Savings exceeded the gross

O O

amount of interest paid and credited during the year to the trustees of Savings Banks in pursuance of the Acts relating to Savings Banks, together with a sum, to be determined by the Treasury, to provide against the depreciation in the value of the securities, the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt shall, within three months after the said account is laid before Parliament, cause the amount of such surplus to be paid out of the Fund for the Banks for Savings into the Exchequer in such 'manner as may from time to time be agreed on between the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury and the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National

Debt.

16. Whereas in pursuance of the Acts relating to Friendly Societies the sums received from Friendly Societies have been invested by the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt in securities in their names to the credit of " The Fund for Friendly Societies," and it is intended that where the interest accrued from such securities in any year is insufficient to meet the interest required by the said Acts to be paid and credited during that year to the said societies, such deficiency should be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, and it is expedient to provide for the disposal of any surplus of the interest so accrued above the interest so paid and credited: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Where the annual account herein-afcer mentioned of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt shows that in the year for which the said account is made up the gross amount of interest accrued from the securities standing in their names to the credit of the Fund for Friendly Societies exceeded the gross amount of interest paid and credited to Friendly Societies in pursuance of the Acts relating to Friendly Societies, together with a sum, to be determined by the Treasury, to provide against depreciation in the value of the securities, the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt shall, within three months after the said account is laid before Parliament, cause the amount of such surplus to be paid out of the Fund for Friendly Societies into the Exchequer in such manner as may from time to time be agreed on between the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury and the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt.

An Act to grant Money for the purpose of Loans by the Public Works Loan Commissioners, and authorise those Commissioners to compound a loan and interest, and amend the Public Works Loans Act, 1875.

[12th July 1877.]

WHEREAS by the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, and other

Acts, the Public Works Loan Commissioners are authorised to make loans for the purposes therein mentioned, and it is expedient to grant the money herein-after mentioned for the purpose of such loans:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Public Works Loans Act, 1877. 2. For the purpose of loans by the Public Works Loan Commissioners, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole four million pounds may be issued out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, or the growing produce thereof, in manner provided by the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, during the period ending on the thirtieth day. of June one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, or on any earlier day at which a further Act authorising the issue of money for the purpose of the said loans comes into operation.

The Treasury may, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided by the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, borrow the said sum or any part thereof.

3. Whereas in the month of March one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, under the enactments then in force in that behalf, the Public Works Loan Commissioners, in pursuance of an application from the churchwardens and overseers of the parish of Whitchurch in the county of Southampton, made with the consent of the inhabitants in vestry assembled, advanced a loan of two thousand pounds for the purpose of enlarging and repairing the parish church of the said parish, and the churchwardens and overseers of the said parish assigned the rates of the said parish as a security for the repayment of the loan, which was to be repaid in twenty years by yearly instalments of one hundred pounds each, with interest at four per centum per annum:

And whereas sums amounting in the whole to six hundred and

fifty-one pounds or thereabouts have been repaid by the parish to the Public Works Loan Commissioners in respect of the principal and interest of the said loan, but there remains unpaid sixteen hundred and seventy-five pounds, or thereabouts, with interest thereon at four per centum per annum from the eighteenth day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one:

And whereas in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight difficulties arose in enforcing the rate made for the purpose of raising the sums due to the Public Works Loan Commissioners, and legal proceedings were taken to enforce the payment of such

Public Works Loans.

141

Ch. 19, 20.

rate, which were ultimately unsuccessful, and of which the churchwardens were ordered to pay the costs:

And whereas in consequence of the said difficulties and proceedings persons declined to serve in the office of churchwarden of the said parish, and no instalments of principal and no interest have been paid, and no rate for the purpose of raising such instalments or interest has been made since the month of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one:

And whereas doubts have arisen as to the power of the Commissioners to enforce payment of the instalments of principal and interest due between the eighteenth of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one and the eighteenth of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, and difficulties exist in enforcing a rate for the payment of any instalments of principal and interest on the said loan:

And whereas the churchwardens of the parish, on behalf of the inhabitants thereof, have offered to pay to the Public Works. Loan Commissioners a sum of one thousand pounds by way of composition for the principal and interest of the said loan, and it is expedient to authorise the Commissioners to accept the same: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The Public Works Loan Commissioners may compound the debt due to them from the parish of Whitchurch, in the county of Southampton, in respect of the said loan for the sum of one thousand pounds, and on the payment of that sum to the Commissioners the said debt shall be extinguished.

4. This Act shall come into operation on the first day of July Commence-one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven.

22. There shall be defrayed by a prison authority in the same manner as if this Act had not passed:

(1.) All debts due and sums of money payable in respect of

contracts performed, dealings completed, or any matter or thing done before the commencement of this Act; and,

23. Where any contract or dealing, in which any prison authority is concerned, is a continuous contract or dealing, to be performed partly before and partly after the commencement of this Act, and is not a contract or dealing which is declared by this Act to have determined, and is not a mortgage debt as defined by the previous section, such contract or dealing shall be deemed to be divisible, and as to so much thereof as is performable before the commencement of this Act, shall create a debt or obligation to be discharged or performed by the prison authority concerned therein, and as to so much thereof as is performable after the commencement of this Act, shall create a debt or obligation to be discharged or performed out of moneys provided by Parliament.

26. The Secretary of State may from time to time by any general or special rule appoint in any county a prison or prisons in which debtors and prisoners who are not criminal prisoner's are to be confined during the period of their imprisonment, and it shall be lawful to confine in any prison so appointed during the period of his imprisonment any debtor or prisoner who is not a criminal prisoner who might, if this Act had not passed, have been confined during such period in any prison situate within the area of the county.

27. Subject to this Act, and any rules made in pursuance thereof, prisoners may be committed to the same prison to which they might have been committed if this Act had not passed.

29. Where any prisoner is discharged from prison, the Prison Commissioners may, on the recommendation of the visiting committee or otherwise, order a sum of money, not exceeding two pounds, to be paid by the gaoler to the prisoner himself or to the treasurer of a certified prisoners aid society or refuge, on the gaoler receiving from such society an undertaking in writing, signed by the secretary thereof, to apply the same for the benefit of the

36. If at any time after the commencement of this Act it appears Superannuate the Treasury that any existing officer of a prison has been in tio" the prison service for not less than twenty years, and is not less of office.1 l°n than sixty years of age, or that any existing officer of a prison has become incapable, from confirmed sickness, age, or infirmity, or in jury received in actual execution of his duty, of executing his office in person, and such sickness, age, infirmity, or injury is certified by a medical certificate, and there shall be a report of the Prison Commissioners testifying to his good conduct during his period of service under them, and recommending a grant to be made to him, the Treasury may grant to such officer, having regard to his length of prison service, an annuity, by way of superannuation allowance, not exceeding two thirds of his salary and emoluments, or a gratuity not exceeding the amount of his salary and emoluments for one year.

of service after the commencement of this Act; and so much of such annuity or allowance as is payable in respect of service before the commencement of this Act, regard being had to the amount of salary then paid, but without taking into account any number of years added to the officers service on account of abolition of office or for facilitating the organization of the department, shall be paid by the prison authority of the prison in which the officer to whom such annuity or allowance is granted was serving at the date of the commencement of this Act out of rates which at or immediately before the commencement of this Act were applicable to the payment of the salary of such officer, and the residue shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament.

O

the last two of such three months as aforesaid, or any part of such last two months, and he may make such substitution either by a general or special regulation, and either conditionally or unconditionally, and may from time to time vary any regulation so made. In making any regulations in pursuance of this section, the Secretary of State shall have regard to the previous convictions, the industry, and the conduct of the prisoners.

38. The Secretary of State may from time to time make, and when made repeal, alter, or add to rules with respect to the classification and treatment of prisoners imprisoned for non-compliance with the order of a justice or justices to pay a sum of money, or imprisoned in respect of the default of a distress to satisfy a sum of money adjudged to be paid by order of a justice or justices, so that such rules are in mitigation and not in increase of the effect of such imprisonment, as regulated by the Prison Act,

1865.

39. Whereas it is expedient that a clear difference shall be made between the treatment of persons unconvicted of crime and in law presumably innocent during the period of their detention in prison for safe custody only, and the treatment of prisoners who have been convicted of crime during the period of their detention in prison for the purpose of punishment, and that, in order to secure the observance of such difference there shall be in force in every place in which prisoners are confined for safe custody only, special rules regulating their confinement in such manner as to make it as little as possible oppressive, due regard only being had to their safe custody, to the necessity of preserving order and good government in the place in which they are confined, and to the physical and

(2.) With respect to communications between a prisoner, his

With respect to arrangements whereby prisoners may provide themselves with articles of diet, or may be furnished with a sufficient quantity of wholesome food, and may be protected from being called upon to perform any unaccustomed tasks or offices; also any matter which the Secretary of State may think conducive to the amelioration of the condition of a prisoner who has not been convicted of crime, regard being had to such matters as are in this section directed to be regarded.

40. The Prison Commissioners shall see that any prisoner under sentence inflicted on conviction for sedition or seditious libel shall be treated as a misdemeanant of the first division within the meaning of section sixty-seven of " The Prisons Act, 1865," notwithstanding any statute, provision, or rule to the contrary.

41. Any person who shall be imprisoned under any rule, order, or attachment for contempt of any court shall be in like manner treated as a misdemeanant of the first division within the meaning of the said section of the said Act.

Companies Acts Amendment.

CHAPTER 26.

An Act to amend the Companies Acts of 1862 and 1867.

[23d July 1877.]

WHEREAS doubts have been entertained .whether the power

given by the Companies Act, 1867, to a company of reducing its capital extends to paid-up capital, and it is expedient to remove such doubts:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Companies Act,

1877.

2. This Act shall, so far as is consistent with the tenor thereof, be construed as one with the Companies Acts, 1862 and 1867, and the said Acts and this Act may be referred to as " The Companies

Acts, 1862, 1867, and 1877."

3. The word "capital" as used in the Companies Act, 1867, shall include paid-up capital; and the power to reduce capital conferred by that Act shall include a power to cancel any lost capital, or any capital unrepresented by available assets, or to pay off* any capital which may be in excess of the wants of the company; and paid-up capital may be reduced either with or without extinguishing or reducing the liability (if any) remaining on the shares of the company, and to the extent to which such liability is not extinguished or reduced it shall be deemed to be preserved, notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Act, 1867.

4. The provisions of the Companies Act, 1867, as amended by this Act, shall apply to any company reducing its capital in pursuance of this Act and of the Companies Act, 1867, as amended by this Act:

Provided that where the reduction of the capital of a company does not involve either the diminution of any liability in respect of unpaid capital or the payment to any shareholder of any paid-up capital,

(1.) The creditors of the company shall not, unless the Court

otherwise direct, be entitled to object or required to consent to the reduction; and (2.) It shall not be necessary before the presentation of the

petition for confirming the reduction to add, and the Court may, if it thinks it expedient so to do, dispense altogether with the addition of the words " and reduced," as mentioned in the Companies Act, 1867.

In any case that the Court thinks fit so to do, it may require the company to publish in such manner as it thinks fit the reasons for the reduction of its capital or such other information in regard to the reduction of its capital as the Court may think expedient with a view to give proper information to the public in relation to the reduction of its capital by a company, and, if the Court thinks fit, the causes which led to such reduction.

6. And whereas it is expedient to make provision for the reception as legal evidence of certificates of incoiporation other than the original certificates, and of certified copies of or extracts from any documents filed and registered under the Companies Acts, 1862 to 1877: Be it enacted, that any certificate of the incoi'poration of any company given by the registrar or by any assistant registrar for the time being shall be received in evidence as if it were the original certificate; and any copy of or extract from any of the documents or part of the documents kept and registered at any of the offices for the registration of joint stock companies in England, Scotland, or Ireland, if duly certified to be a true copy under the hand of the registrar or one of the assistant registrars for the time being, and whom it shall not be necessary to prove to be the registrar or assistant registrar, shall, in all legal proceedings, civil or criminal, and in all cases whatsoever, be received in evidence as of equal validity with the original document.

CHAPTER 27.

An Act to grant Money for the purposes of Loans by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, and to remit certain Loans, and to amend the Law relating to Loans for public purposes by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland. [23d July 1877.]

WHEREAS under divers Acts, and particularly those mentioned in the first schedule to this Act, advances out of the Consolidated Fund are made, without interest, for divers purposes in Ireland, and are repayable by counties, counties of cities, and counties of towns in Ireland upon presentments made by the grand jury, and such advances are made in different methods and by different authorities:

And whereas it is expedient to authorise interest to be charged on such of those advances as are mentioned in the first part of the said schedule, and to provide that they should be made in one method and by one authority:

And whereas it is expedient that the advances under the Acts mentioned in the second part of the first schedule to this Act should, after a limited period, be made by treasurers of counties, and not out of the Consolidated Fund:

And whereas certain advances out of the Consolidated Fund have been made in Ireland for the Objects mentioned in the second schedule to this Act, and upon each of these advances the amount

Ch. 27.

mentioned in that schedule, together with interest, is unpaid, and due to the Consolidated Fund:

And whereas no sums have been recovered, either by way of principal or interest, upon the said advances during a long period of years, and it is inexpedient to keep open for any further period the account of such advances:

And whereas it is expedient to make better provision with respect to the provision of funds for the purpose of loans by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, and to grant money for those loans:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

tioned in the first part of the first schedule to this Act, or of any i^ebnd^and1 other Act authorising loans to local authorities in Ireland without provisions as interest (other than for the purposes mentioned in the second part to their !ss.ue of the said schedule), shall bear interest at the rate of three and and remission* a half per cent, per annum, or at such other rate as the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury (in this Act referred to as the Treasury) from time to time fix, in order to enable the advance to be made without loss to the Exchequer.

All such advances shall be made through the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, acting under the direction of the Treasury, in such manner as the Treasury shall by order from time to time direct; and the power vested by the said Acts in the Lord Lieutenant, or the Lord Lieutenant in Council, to direct any sum to be issued out of the Consolidated Fund, shall be transferred to and vested in the Treasury.

Every such advance and the interest thereon shall be repaid within such period from the date of the advance as the Treasury shall by order from time to time fix, so that it do not in any case exceed twenty year's or any less period fixed by the said Acts; all orders made by the Treasury in pursuance of this section shall be laid before each House of Parliament within forty days next after the same are made, if Parliament is then sitting, or, if not, within forty days after the then next meeting of Parliament.

Any advance made in pursuance of those Acts before the said day shall be repaid by such instalments as the Treasury may fix.

8. Whereas by section three of the Act of the session of the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth years of Her Majesty, chapter eighty-two, intituled " An Act to afford facilities for the erection, enlarge- ment, improvement, and purchase of dwelling-houses for residences " for teachers of certain national schools in Ireland," it is provided that every loan shall be repayable by an annual sum of five pounds for every one hundred pounds of such sum from time to time advanced, and to be payable for the term of thirty-five years, to be computed from the date of the advance in respect of which the said annual sum shall be charged, such annual sum to be paid by equal half-yearly payments on the fifth day of April and tenth day of October in every year during the said term of thirty-five years, with such apportionment, if any, as may be necessary in respect of the first and last of such payments:

And whereas it is desirable that the repayment of all loans made under the provisions of the said recited Acts of the tenth, the twenty-ninth and thirtieth, and the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth years of Her present Majesty shall be uniform in respect of date of repayment and interest:

Be it therefore enacted that in all advances made in pursuance of the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth Victoria, chapter eighty-two, notwithstanding the provisions of the said recited third section as to the mode of computing the rent charges payable thereunder, such rentcharges shall be computed and paid in accordance with the provisions of the third section of the twenty-ninth and thirtieth Victoria, chapter forty, as amended by the seventh section of this Act in respect of interest which shall accrue from the date of the advance to the first gale day wThich shall next happen.

of Public 1

11. For the purpose of passing an annual Act of Parliament granting money for the purpose of loans by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, every intending borrower shall send to the Commissioners, on or before the thirty-first day of December in every year, a statement of the new loan or instalments of a loan already granted which the sender will probably apply to borrow during the ensuing financial year; and the Commissioners of Public Works shall as soon as practicable submit all such statements to the Treasury, with such observations thereon and information respecting the same as they may think expedient, and as may be necessary for enabling the Treasury to lay before the House of Commons an estimate of the amount required to be granted for the purpose of loans by the Commissioners of Public Works.

The Commissioners of Public Works shall not, except with the special permission of the Treasury, decide upon complying with an application for a loan, or advance any instalment of a loan, which lias not been included in such a statement as above mentioned.

The Treasury, if they think that after providing for the loans and instalments included in the said statements, or such of them as will actually be advanced, there will be a balance out of the sum granted by Parliament sufficient to meet any loan or instalment not included in the statements, may, if they think fit, grant such special permission, and may grant it conditionally upon the said balance being in their opinion sufficient when the time for the actual payment arrives.

The Commissioners of Public Works, with the consent of the Treasury, may, if they think fit, from time to time make and when made rescind and vary regulations requiring quarterly statements to be sent by the borrowers of the amounts which will be required by such borrowers; and while such regulations, if any, are in force, the Treasury may, if they think fit, refuse to issue in any quarter of a financial year any larger sum than the total of the amounts named in the statements referring to such quarter.

12. When any money has been granted by Parliament for the purpose of loans by the Commissioners of Public Works, the Treasury may from time to time, as they think fit, issue out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, produce thereof, the required sums, not exceeding in the whole the amount so granted.

The said sums shall be issued in such manner as the Treasury may from time to time direct during the period authorised by the Act granting the same, or, if no period is authorised, during the financial year for which such Act was passed, and not subsequently.

13. All money so issued shall be placed to the general cash account at the Bank of Ireland of the Commissioners of Public Works for the purpose of loans by them; and all enactments for the time being in force for the regulation of the Commissioners of Public Works, and the money at their disposal, and their securities,

14, If the Act granting money for the purpose of loans by the Commissioners of Public Works authorises the Treasury to borrow such money, or any part thereof, the Treasury may raise any sums (not exceeding the amount authorised by the said Act to be borrowed, and not exceeding in any one financial year the excess of the issues out of the Consolidated Fund under this Act during that year over the repayments to the Consolidated Fund during that year in respect of the principal of loans granted by the Commissioners of Public Works either before or after the passing of this Act,) in such one or more of the following methods as may be directed by the Act authorising the monejr to be borrowed, and subject to any such direction as may be deemed most convenient for the public service, namely, by the creation of three pounds per centum per annum permanent annuities, or of annuities for any term not exceeding thirty years, or by the issue of Exchequer bonds or Exchequer bills, or Treasury bills, or by otherwise borrowing the same (for a period not exceeding six months) on the credit of the charge created by this Act on the Consolidated Fund, or by all of such means; and the sums so raised shall be placed to the credit of the account of Her Majesty's Exchequer, and form part of the Consolidated Fund.

The annuities created in pursuance of this section, and the principal moneys borrowed in pursuance of this section (otherwise than by the issue of Exchequer bonds), and all interest from time to time due thereon, or on Exchequer bonds issued under this section (not exceeding the rate of five per cent, per annum), shall be charged upon and be payable out of the Consolidated Fund, or out of the growing produce thereof, at such times in each year as may be fixed by the Treasury.

The principal of any Exchequer bonds issued under this section shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament.

The annuities, whether terminable or perpetual, shall be created by warrant of the Treasury to the Bank of England, directing them to inscribe in their books the amount of such annuities in the

t

names directed by the warrant.

The said annuities shall, in manner directed by the warrant, be consolidated in the said books, if terminable, with annuities payable at the same date, and if permanent, with annuities at the same rate of interest, and payable at the same date, and shall be transferable in the said books in like manner as the annuities with which they are consolidated, and shall be subject to the enactments relating to those annuities so far as is consistent with the tenor

of those enactments.

The advance to this school was made in 1815 on the faith of two private individuals standing surety for its repayment. In 1846, however, no trace could be found of the records of the recognizance which was supposed to have been entered.

The endowments of this school are small, and the condition of the school is low.

At the end of last century certain Commissioners were appointed to make the streets of Dublin wider and more convenient; and to assist these Commissioners in their work, a sum of 35,987/. Is. 2d. was advanced to them in 1800, on the condition that the money should be repaid with interest at 5 per cent, out of the coal duty vested in them. In 1825 a further advance was made to the Commissioners of 190,741/. 16s. 4c/., which was likewise secured on the coal duty, but a rate of 3 per cent, only was charged as interest on both these advances. Though no principal was repaid, yet interest continued to be paid till the year 1832, when the duty on coal imported into Dublin was permitted to expire. No further payments have since been received in respect of this loan. The consequence is that the whole of the principal is outstanding, with arrears of interest since 1832. Thus, the assistance which was given ostensibly in the shape of a loan to the city of Dublin towards the improvement of its streets, assumed in reality the form of a subsidy.

This loan was made on the security of the tolls and dues leviable under Acts of Parliament, and was to be repaid with interest at the rate of 5 per cent. The Act 1 Geo. 4. c. 26., however, diminished the security by putting an end to some of the coasting dues. This was followed by the trade between England and Ireland being declared a coasting trade, and later on by Act 24 & 25 Vict. c. 47 .; the combined effect of which was that the dues imposed under the original Act of 1816 were entirely abolished.

A sum of 286,000/. was advanced by the Bank of Ireland for the relief of trade to different traders in the year 1821, with the guarantee of the Treasury for so much as was not repaid to the Bank by the borrowers. The Treasury thus became liable for a sum of 178,076/. 7 s.7d. In the case of the loans to Sheahy, Moylan, Renayne, Delany, and Sausse, efforts have been made to recover the outstanding balances without success.

In the case of Nowlan and Shaw proceedings have long been pending against Mr. Timothy Nowlan, in New South Wales, and a compromise has been effected by which the principal and interest due to the Government have been remitted in consideration of the payment of a sum of 5,000/.

This money was issued for the purpose of compensating officers of the Court of Exchequer whose emoluments were diminished by the first-mentioned Act, and was repayable out of the Suitors' Fund. A small sum only was repaid direct, but under 31 & 32 Vict. c. 88. the stock standing to the credit of the Fee Fund of the Courts of Chancery and Court of Exchequer was sold, and the proceeds of the sale, together with the cash standing to the account, amounting to 175,982/. 15s. 3d., were paid into the Exchequer. Consequently the debt may be considered to have been virtually paid, although not actually cancelled.

[2d August 1877.]

WHEREAS divers funds have been authorised to be raised for

the purposes of the Telegraph Acts, 1868 to 1870, and with a view to the payment under those Acts of compensation to railway companies in respect of telegraphs it is expedient to authorise the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury (in this Act referred to as the Treasury) to raise further funds for the purposes of those Acts: Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. The Treasury at any time before the first day of April one thousand eight hunderd and seventy-nine may, in addition to any sum previously authorised to be raised by them, raise for the purposes of the Telegraph Acts, 1868 to 1870, any sum or sums of money not exceeding in the whole five hundred thousand pounds sterling, by the creation of three pounds per cent, per annum permanent annuities.

Such annuities shall be charged upon the Consolidated Fund, and shall be paid out of the permanent annual charge for the National Debt.

The annuities shall be created by warrant of the Treasury to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, directing them to inscribe in their books the amount of such annuities in the names directed by the warrant.

The said annuities shall in manner directed by the warrant be consolidated in the said books with annuities at the same rate of interest and payable at the same date, and shall be transferable in the said books in like manner as the annuities with which they are consolidated, and shall be subject to the enactments relating to those annuities so far as is consistent with the tenor of those enactments.

2. All moneys raised in pursuance of this Act shall be placed to the account of the Paymaster General at the Bank of England and shall be issued from time to time under regulations to be made by the Treasury, and to be laid by them before Parliament; such moneys shall not be applied for the purpose of the extension of telegraphs or for the payment of interest on any purchase-money or compensation payable in respect of telegraphs, unless such interest

is not separately stated in any award or agreement, but shall be applied only for the other purposes of the Telegraph Acts, 1868 to 187°.

3. Accounts of all expenditure out of moneys raised in pursuance of this Act shall be prepared by the Postmaster General in the form approved by the Treasury, and be transmitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General, to be examined by him as if they were appropriation accounts, in manner directed by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.

4. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Telegraphs (Money) Act, 1877; and this Act and the Telegraph Acts, 1868 to 1876 may be cited together as the Telegraph Acts, 1868 to 1877.

CHAPTER 31.

An Act to give further facilities to Landowners of limited interests in England and Wales and Ireland to charge their estates with the expenses of constructing Reservoirs for the storage of Water, and other similar purposes.

[2d August 1877.]

WHEREAS landowners of limited interests in England and Wales, with the approval of the Inclosure Commissioners, and in Ireland of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, are enabled to charge their estates with sums expended by them in constructing reservoirs and other works for the supply of water, if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the said Commissioners that such works will effect a permanent yearly increase in the value of such estates for agricultural purposes exceeding the yearly amount proposed to be charged thereon, and are also enabled to charge their estates with sums subscribed for the construction of railways and navigable canals, if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners that such railways and canals will effect a permanent yearly increase in the value of such estates for any purpose exceeding the yearly amount proposed to be charged thereon:

And whereas in many places it would greatly conduce to the affording of a plentiful supply of pure water to the inhabitants of villages and towns and to the industrial requirements of the locality, if facilities were given to landowners of limited interests to charge their estates, subject to the approval of the Commissioners, with sums expended by them in constructing reservoirs and other works for the supply of water, of a character permanently to increase the value of such estates for other than agricultural purposes, or to be otherwise permanently productive of profit to the owners of the estates, and if such landowners were also enabled to charge their estates with sums subscribed by them for the construction of waterworks on the same terms and conditions as those on which they are now enabled to charge their estates with subscriptions for the construction of railways and canals:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and

Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Limited Owners Reservoirs and Water Supply Further Facilities Act, 1877.

2. This Act shall not extend to Scotland.

3. This Act shall be incorporated with the Improvement of Land Act, 1864, and the two Acts shall be read together as one Act.

4. The provisions of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1863, with respect to the security of the reservoirs constructed by the undertakers are incorporated with this Act; and in that Act, as incorporated with this Act, the expression "the special Act" shall mean and include the Improvement of Land Act, 1864, and this Act; and the expression " the undertakers" shall mean any person who constructs or erects any reservoir or dam under the authority of either of the last-mentioned Acts.

5. The construction or erection of reservoirs or other works of a permanent character for the supply of water to persons residing or engaged in labour on the lands on which such works are situate, or on any other lands settled to the same uses, or for the more convenient or profitable user of such lands, or for the supply of water to any sanitary or other local authority or water company, or to any manufacturer or other person, or for any one or more of such purposes, shall be deemed to be an improvement of land within the meaning of the ninth section of the Improvement of Land Act, 1864, and shall be sanctioned by the Commissioners, if it can be shown to their satisfaction that such reservoirs or works for the supply of water will for any purpose effect a permanent yearly increase in the value of the lands on which they are situate, or any other lands settled to the same uses, or will be permanently productive of a yearly revenue to the owner of such lands exceeding the yearly amount proposed to be charged thereon; and the construction of any such works shall be deemed to include the purchase by the landowner of any water right or other easement which might otherwise interfere with or prevent the construction of the same or any such supply of water as aforesaid.

In calculating whether the improvement is likely to effect a permanent increase of the yearly value of the land, or be productive of a yearly revenue to the landowner exceeding the yearly amoimt proposed to be charged thereon, it shall be lawful for the Commissioners to take into account the value of any contract, the terms of which have been agreed upon between the landowner and any sanitary or other local authority, or water company, or manufacturer or other persons, for the purpose of supplying such authority, company, person, or persons with water, as well as the effect on such value or revenue of any sum expended by the landowner in the construction of the works over and above the sum proposed to be charged upon the land.

When the improvement will afford a supply of water to persons residing or engaged in labour on the lands on which the proposed works will be situate, or on any other lands settled to the same uses, the Commissioners may, if they think fit, sanction the improvement, although it may not be shown that the same will effect a

direct yearly increase in the value of the lands, or be productive of a yearly revenue to the owner of the lands exceeding the yearly amount proposed to be charged thereon.

6.

An Act to remit certain Loans formerly made out of the Consolidated Lund or other Public Revenue of the United

Kingdom. [2d August 1877.]

WHEREAS certain advances out of the Consolidated Fund or other public revenue of the United Kingdom have been made for the objects mentioned in the schedule to this Act, and the account of each of these advances shows the amount mentioned in that schedule, together with interest, to be unpaid, and due to the Consolidated Fund:

And whereas in the case of the advance for the purchase of a Bankruptcy Court it is doubtful whether the amount has not been virtually repaid, and in the case of certain other advances it is doubtful whether the advance has not been remitted, and in the case of all the said advances there is no prospect of recovering any further amount by way of principal or interest, and it is inexpedient to keep open for any further period the account of such advances: Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, oy and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Public Loans Remission Act,

1877.

2. The debts due to the Consolidated Fund mentioned in the schedule to this Act, and all arrears of interest thereon, shall, after the passing of this Act, but subject to the provisions contained in the schedule, be extinguished, and the amount of debt so extinguished shall be considered as a free grant from Parliament.

Account of Advance and reason for

Remission.

vanced on a mortgage of the land on the line of the canal and of the works, tolls, and rates, to be repaid in 10 years with interest at per cent. In 1838 the undertaking had failed, owing to the defective execution of the works. In 1849 the Canadian Government informed the Secretary of State that owing to some defect in the mortgage, claims might be established to the property in priority to the mortgage. In 1851 the mortgage was foreclosed and the property sold to the Colonial Government for 404/. The Imperial Government in January 1852 surrendered their claim to this sum, and only required a guarantee for the right of free passage in the event of the canal being completed by the locality. The debt was thus virtually remitted in 1852.

In 1845 the New Zealand Company applied for the loan, and at the same time claimed compensation for injury received by reason of the passing of certain Acts of the Imperial Parliament, and of the local legislature since the formation of the company, and in 1846, 100,000/. was lent to the company on a mortgage of their landed property, to be repaid with interest at 3 per cent, in seven years. The company soon applied for a further loan, together with a further claim for damages. The Imperial Government admitted that the operations of the company had been advantageous to the colony, and a further advance of 136,000/. was made. The Act 10 & 11 Vict. c. 112. (which authorised this loan) directed (s. 15) that no interest should be charged on that or on the former loan, and further provided (s. 19) that if the directors of the company gave notice to a Secretary of State that they were ready to surrender the charters of the company, the lands of the company should revert to Her Majesty as part of the demesne lands of the Crown in New Zealand, and (s. 20) that upon such reversion the claim in respect of the said loans should be remitted to the company. The above notice was given by the directors of the company on the 4th of July 1850 (14 & 15 Vict. c. 86.), and although the condition imposed by 10 & 11 Vict. c. 112. was fulfilled, the debt has never been formally cancelled.

It may be stated that in addition to the sum outstanding on account of principal it is computed that the amount of simple interest unpaid in respect of these

loans is not less than 500,000/.

And whereas by the same Act the Secretary of State is authorised, on the recommendation of the local authority as therein mentioned, to order that certain business specified in the recommendation should not be included in fixing the salary of any clerk, and that such clerk should be paid for that business (in this Act referred to as excepted business) by fees and not by salary:

And whereas it is expedient to provide that all the said clerks should be paid by salary in lieu of fees, and to provide for the qualification, appointment, and fees of the said clerks:

Bo it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Justices Clerks Act, 1877.

2. Where at the passing of this Act an order under the principal Act is not in force for the payment by salary in lieu of fees of any clerk of special or petty sessions or clerk of justices of the peace within the jurisdiction of any local authority, that local authority shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, and in any case before the first day of February one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, make a recommendation to a Secretary of State in pursuance of the principal Act with respect to the payment of such clerk by salary in lieu of fees, and the Secretary of State shall make an order directing such payment; and if, in the case of any of the said clerks, such recommendation as enables a Secretary of State to make an order under the principal Act is not received by the Secretary of State before the said first day of February, the Secretary of State shall, in like manner (so nearly as circumstances admit) as if such recommendation had been duly made, make an order under the principal Act, directing the payment of such clerk by salary in lieu of fees for all business (other than the business of giving copies of depositions if that business is excepted by the order) and fixing the amount of the salary.

Every such salary may, if it is thought fit, be made to vary according to the number of cases or amount of business.

Subject as aforesaid, every such salary shall be deemed to accrue from day to day and shall be paid quarterly or at such less intervals as may be from time to time fixed by the local authority.

3. Where at the passing of this Act an order is in force under the principal Act for the payment of any clerk of special or petty sessions or clerk of justices of the peace by salary in lieu of fees, but an order has been made that such clerk should be paid for certain excepted business (other than that of giving copies of depositions) by fees and not by salary, this Act shall, so far as is consistent with the tenour thereof, apply, as regards the fees for the excepted business, in like manner as it applies where an order is not in force for the payment of a clerk by salary in lieu of fees.

Where any such clerk as aforesaid is, in pursuance of any Act of Parliament (other than the principal Act), paid by salary in lieu of fees, either for all business, or for all business other than that of giving copies of depositions, that clerk shall continue to be paid by salary in lieu of fees for all such business, and a recommendation need not be made with respect to such clerk in pursuance of this Act.

4. Where at the passing of this Act any clerk of special or petty sessions or clerk of justices of the peace is by arrangement paid by salary in lieu of fees, either for all business, or for all business other than that of giving copies of depositions, that clerk shall continue to be paid by salary in lieu of fees for all such business, and unless a Secretary of State requires a recommendation to be made with respect to such clerk in pursuance of this Act, such arrangement shall have effect as if it were an order of the Secretary of State under the principal Act, and this Act shall apply accordingly.

Justices Clerks.

5. In each petty sessional division there shall after the first day of February one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, or any later date at which an order for the payment of a clerk by salary in lieu of fees comes into operation in the division, be only one salaried clerk in the division to perform the duties of clerk of petty sessions, clerk of special sessions, or clerk of any justice or justices of the peace:

Provided that —

(1.) Where special or petty sessions are usually held at more than

one place appointed for the purpose in a petty sessional division, there may, if it seem fit, be a separate salaried clerk appointed in respect of each such place; and

(2.) Where a Secretary of State has fixed the amount of the

salary for one salaried clerk in a division, and there are, at the passing of this Act, two clerks, each of whom performs the duties of clerk of petty sessions and clerk of special sessions in that division, the local authority may, if they think fit, continue such existing clerks in office, and apportion the salary between those clerks in such manner as they think just; and

(3.) Where any partners have before the passing of this Act

jointly performed the duties of clerk of petty sessions or clerk of special sessions, the local authority may, if they think fit, continue such existing clerks in office and pay the salary to such clerks jointly.

(4.) A Secretary of State, on the application of the local authority,

may, if he thinks fit, authorise in any case the appointment of more than one salaried clerk.

The said section thirty is hereby repealed so far as relates to clerks of special and petty sessions and clerks of justices of the peace without prejudice to anything done in pursuance of that section.

Where complaint is made to a Secretary of State that the aggregate amount received by the treasurer of a local authority in respect of court fees unduly exceeds or unduly falls below the aggregate amount paid by that authority by way of salary as aforesaid, or that for other reasons it is expedient that the table of court fees should be revised, he may, if he think fit, by order, require the local authority to make a return to him within the time specified in the order of the aggregate amount so received and paid during* three years previous to the order, or of the table of court fees in force for the time being, as the case may be, and if, on receiving such return, or on the failure of the local authority to make the return, he is, after making such inquiry as he thinks proper, satisfied of the truth of the complaint, he may, by order, require the local authority to make and lay before him, within the time (not beiDg less than four months from the date of the order) specified in the order, a table of court fees in pursuance of this section, and if the local authority fail to comply with the order, he may, in like manner (so nearly as circumstances admit) as if the local authority had laid before him a table of fees in pursuance of this section, settle a table of fees and certify that the fees in that table are proper to be taken within the jurisdiction of the said local authority.

A Secretary of State, upon certifying a table of fees in pursuance of this section, shall cause copies thereof to be sent to the clerk of the local authority to be by him distributed to the clerks of petty sessional divisions and clerks to justices within the jurisdiction of that authority, and if at any time thereafter any of those clerks or any other person wilfully demands or receives any other or greater court fee than such as is set down in the said table, he shall forfeit for every such demand or receipt twenty pounds, to be recovered by action of debt by any person who may sue for the same.

No rule shall be made by the General Prisons Board inconsistent with any of the regulations contained in the one hundred and ninth section of the Act of the seventh year of the reign of King George the Fourth, chapter seventy-four.

13. Whereas it is expedient that a clear difference shall be made between the treatment of persons unconvicted of crime and in law presumably innocent during the period of their detention in prison for safe custody only, and the treatment of prisoners who have been convicted of crime during the period of their detention in prison for the purpose of punishment, and that, in order to secure the observance of such difference, there shall be in force in every place in which prisoners are confined for safe custody onljr, special rules regulating their confinement in such manner as to make it as little as possible oppressive, due regard only being had to their safe custody, to the necessity of a conformity to regular rules for the purpose of preserving order and good government in the place in which they are confined, and to the physical and moral wellbeing of the prisoners themselves; therefore be it enacted, that the General Prisons Board shall, subject to the approval of the Lord Lieutenant and Privy Council, make, and when made may from time to time repeal, alter, or add to, special rules:

(1.) With respect to the retention by a prisoner of the possession

of any books, papers, or documents in his possession at the time of his arrest, and which may not be required for evidence against him, and are not reasonably suspected of forming part of property improperly acquired by him, or are not for some special reason required to be taken from him for the purposes of justice;

(2.) With respect to communications between a prisoner, his

solicitor, and friends, so as to secure to such prisoner as unrestricted and private communication between him, his solicitor, and his friends as may be possible, having regard only to the necessity of preventing any tampering with evidence, and any plans for escape, or other like considerations; and

(3.) With respect to arrangements whereby prisoners may provide

themselves with articles of diet, or may be furnished with a sufficient quantity of wholesome food, and maybe protected from being called upon to perform any unaccustomed tasks or offices; also any matter which the General Prisons Board may think conducive to the amelioration of the condition of a prisoner who has not been convicted of crime, regard being had to such matters as are in this section directed to be regarded.

14. The General Prisons Board may, subject to the approval of the Lord Lieutenant and Privy Council, from time to time make,

and when made repeal, alter, or add to, rules with respect to the classification and treatment of prisoners imprisoned for non-compliance with the order of a justice or justices to pay any sum of money, or imprisoned in respect of the default of a distress to satisfy a sum of money adjudged to be paid by order of a justice or justices.

15. The General Prisons Board shall, at such time or times as the Lord Lieutenant may appoint, make a report or reports to the Lord Lieutenant of the condition of the prisons and prisoners within their jurisdiction, and with respect to the registration of criminals; and an annual report to be made by them with respect to every prison within their jurisdiction shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament.

Such report shall include a yearly return of all punishments of any kind which may have been inflicted within each prison, and the offences for which such punishments were inflicted.

So much of any Statute in force immediately before the time of the passing of this Act as would impose upon the General Prisons Board any obligation to make any report shall be and the same is hereby repealed; and the several reports in this section mentioned shall be in substitution for all the reports heretofore made by the inspectors general of prisons, the directors of convict prisons, and the registrar of criminals respectively.

16. Whereas it is expedient that the expense of maintaining in prison prisoners who have been convicted of crime should in part be defrayed by their labour during the period of their imprisonment, and that, with a view of defraying such expenses and also of teaching prisoners modes of gaining honest livelihoods, means should be taken for promoting in prison the exercise of and instruction in useful trades and manufactures, so far as may be consistent with a due regard on the one hand to the maintenance of the penal character of prison discipline, and on the other to the avoidance of undue pressure on or competition with a particular trade or industry: Be it enacted that the annual report of the General Prisons Board required by this Act to be laid before Parliament shall state the various trades and manufacturing processes carried on in each of the prisons within their jurisdiction, and such statement shall contain such particulars as to the kind and quantities of, and as to the commercial value of the labour employed on, such trades and manufactures, and as to the number of prisoners employed, and otherwise, as may in the opinion of the Lord Lieutenant be best calculated to aflord information to Parliament.

He shall, without delay, report to the visiting committee of justices any case of insanity or apparent insanity occurring among the prisoners.

to finance or to account shall, before receiving the approval of the Lord Lieutenant and Privy Council, be submitted to and approved by the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury.

(c.) All such rules and special rules shall be forthwith laid in

complete form, after the same shall have been settled and approved by the Lord Lieutenant and Privy Council, before both Houses of Parliament, if Parliament be sitting, or if not, then within three weeks after the beginning of the next ensuing session of Parliament; and if any such rules shall be disapproved by either House of Parliament within forty days after the same shall have been so laid before Parliament, such rules, or such part thereof as shall be so disapproved of, shall be void and have no effect: Provided also, that no such rules shall come into force or operation until the same shall have been laid before Parliament for forty days.

All such rules and special rules not disapproved in manner aforesaid shall be published in the Dublin Gazette, and the production of a printed copy of the Dublin Gazette, purporting to be printed and published by the Queen's authority, and containing the publication of such rules, shall be conclusive evidence of the making of such rules. A copy of the rules shall be posted in some conspicuous place in every prison to which the same relate, and, so long as the same shall continue in force, shall be of the same validity as if enacted by this Act. The rules and byelaws of every prison existing at the time of the passing of this Act shall continue in force unless and so far as the same shall not be altered or repealed in manner aforesaid.

The Lord Chancellor may, with the consent of the Treasury, increase the salary of any officer who is by this Act attached to the Supreme Court, or any Court, Division, or Judge thereof, and whose duties are increased by reason of the passing of this Act.

In case it shall appear to the Lord Chancellor that, by reason of the consolidation or abolition of offices under the provisions of this Act, the continuance of the services of any officer holding during good behaviour, or during good behaviour subject to removal for cause by some Court or Judge, is unnecessary, the Lord Chancellor may, with the concurrence of the Treasury, make arrangements for the release of such officer from his duties, and thereupon it shall be in the power of the Treasury to award to such officer such compensation as, having regard to his period of service, to the teuure of the office held by him, the Treasury shall consider just and reasonable: Provided always, where such officer shall have served for any period not exceeding fifteen years, the annual amount so to be awarded shall not be more than one half of the salary and emoluments of the office held by him, and for each year of completed service exceeding fifteen years there shall be awarded in addition one thirtieth part of the salary and emoluments of the office, but in no case shall the sum awarded exceed three fourth parts of the salary and emoluments of such office: Provided also, that in addition to any compensation to be awarded under the foregoing provisions the Lord Chancellor, with the concurrence of the Treasury, may award to any officer having by statute any right of succession to a position of higher rank and emolument such further compensation in respect of such right as, having regard to the circumstances of the case and to the amount awarded under the foregoing provisions, shall appear just and reasonable: Provided also, that no such officer appointed before the passing of this Act shall be so released without his consent.

In every case in which the compensation awarded under such special circumstances affecting the tenure or position of an officer as are above referred to shall exceed the amount which might be awarded under the provisions of the seventh section of the Super- 22 Vict. c. 26. annuation Act, 1859, without a special minute being laid before Parliament, the compensation shall be awarded by special minute of the Treasury, stating the reasons for it, and a copy of the minute

Ch. 57.

As soon as the said Government securities have been so transferred, the Treasury shall by warrant direct the Governor and Company of the Bank of England to cancel such securities in their books.

The cash standing in the books of the Bank of Ireland at the time of the passing of this Act to the credit of an account called " the Unclaimed Dividend Account " under the Irish Bankrupt and Insolvent Act, 1857, or so much of the same as shall be determined by the Treasury, and all dividends and all moneys the produce of any bankrupt, arranging debtors, or insolvent estate, which shall from time to time after the passing of this Act be paid into or transferred to the credit of the "Unclaimed Dividend Account" under the provisions of section two hundred and ninety-five of the Irish Bankrupt and Insolvent Act, 1857, and which have remained unclaimed for a period of not less than five years from the time on which the same have been respectively paid into or transferred to the said account, shall be from time to time paid to the account of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt in such manner as the Treasury may direct. The Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt shall apply all cash transferred to their account in pursuance of this section in reduction of the National Debt in the same manner as the moneys issued to them under the Sinking Fund Act, 1875.

Where any Court having jurisdiction in the matter of Bankruptcy is satisfied that any person claiming is entitled to any dividend or other payment out of the moneys carried to the account of the said Commissioners under the provisions of this section, such Court may order payment of the same in like manner as it might have done if the same had not been carried to the said last-mentioned account. In case the moneys standing to the credit of the said Unclaimed Dividend Account shall at any time be insufficient to meet the payments to be made out of the same, the Treasury shall issue out of the Consolidated Fund, or out of the growing produce thereof, such sum as may appear to them to be necessary to provide for the said payments.

All salaries, allowances, damages, costs, and expenses before the passing of this Act charged on and payable out of the said Unclaimed Dividend Account, or the interest and profit arising therefrom, shall, from and after the passing of this Act, be paid out of moneys to be provided by Parliament for such purpose.

All actions which have hitherto been commenced by writ of summons and plaint in the Superior Courts of Common Law in Ireland, and all suits which have hitherto been commenced by bill or information in the High Court of Chancery, shall be instituted in the High Court of Justice by a proceeding to be called an action.

All other proceedings in and applications to the High Court may, subject to Rules of Court, be taken and made in the same manner as they would have been taken and made in any Court in which any proceeding or application of the like kind could have been taken or made if this Act had not passed.

Writ of Summons.

(Actions to be commenced by writ.)

2. Every action in the High Court shall be commenced by a writ of summons which shall be indorsed with a statement of the nature of the claim made, or of the relief or remedy required in the action, and which shall specify the Division of the High Court to which it is intended that the action should be assigned.

3. Every writ of summons and the indorsement thereon may be in one of the forms herein-after referred to, and any costs incurred by the use of any more prolix or other forms of writs or of indorsements thereon than the forms herein-after referred to shall be borne by the party using the same unless the court shall otherwise prescribe.

o. The indorsement of claim shall be made on every writ of summous before it is issued.

6. In the indorsement it shall not be essential to set forth the precise ground of complaint, or the precise remedy or relief to which the plaintiff considers himself entitled. The plaintiff may, by leave of the Court or Judge, amend such indorsement so as to extend it to any other cause of action or any additional remedy or relief. If none of the forms herein-after referred to shall be applicable to the case, such other similarly concise form may be used as the nature of the case may require.

7. Writs of summons shall be prepared by the plaintiff or his solicitor in such manner as shall be directed by rules, and shall be sealed by the proper officer, and shall thereupon be deemed to be issued.

393

Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland). Ch. 57.

8. The plaintiff or his solicitor shall, on presenting any writ of summons for sealing, leave with the officer a copy of such writ, and all the indorsements thereon, and such copy shall be signed by or for the solicitor leaving the same, or by the plaintiff himself if he sues in person.

9. The officer receiving such copy shall file the same, and an entry of the filing thereof shall be made in a book to be called the Cause Book, in such manner as shall be directed by rules.

10. Except as otherwise provided by this Act, all writs of summons shall be served in the same manner respectively as process from the Court whose jurisdiction is transferred to the High Court might have been served if this Act had not been passed, and the High Court shall have the same power of directing substitution of service, or that any service already made should be deemed good, or that notice should be substituted for sendee, ns might have been exercised by the said Courts respectively if this Act had not been passed.

11. Service of a writ of summons to recover possession of land may be made in the same manner as a summons and plaint in ejectment might have been served if this Act had not been passed.

Interpleader.

12. The procedure and practice used before the passing of this Act with respect to interpleader by Courts of Common Law in Ireland shall apply to all the Divisions of the High Court of Justice, and the application by a defendant shall be made at any time after being served with a writ of summons and before delivering a defence.

Appearance.

13. The defendant shall be bound to appear to the writ of summons at such time and in such manner as may be directed by rules.

14. It shall not be necessary for the defendant on entering an appearance to any writ of summons to file any defence or answer thereto. He shall enter an appearance by delivering to the proper officer a memorandum in writing, dated on the day of delivering the same, and containing the name of the defendant's solicitor, or stating that the defendant defends in person.

The solicitor of a defendant appearing by a solicitor shall state in such memorandum his registered residence.

A defendant appealing in person shall state in such memorandum his address, and a place to be called his address for service, which shall be in Ireland.

15. If the memorandum does not contain such address it shall not be received; and if any such address shall be illusory or fictitious, the appearance may be set aside by the Court or a Judge, on the application of the plaintiff.

16. Upon receipt of a memorandum of appearance, the officer shall forthwith enter the appearance in the Cause Book.

17. Any person not named as a defendant in a writ of summons for the recovery of land may, by leave of the Court or Judge, appear and defend, on filing an affidavit showing that he is in possession of the land either by himself or his tenant.

Parties.

19. No action shall be defeated by reason of the misjoinder of parties, and the Court may in every action deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interests of the parties actually before it. The Court or Judge may, at any stage of the proceedings, either upon or without the application of either party, in the manner prescribed by rules, and on such terms as may appear to the Court or a Judge to be just, order that the name or names of any party or parties, whether as plaintiffs or as defendants, improperly joined be struck out, and that the name or names of any party or parties, whether plaintiffs or defendants, who ought to have been joined, or whose presence before the Court may be necessary in order to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the action, be added. No person shall be added as a plaintiff suing without a next friend, or as the next friend of a plaintiff under any disability, without hi3 own consent thereto. All parties

Ch. 57.

Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland). 40 & 41 VICT.

whose names are so added as defendants shall be served with a summons or notice in such manner as may be prescribed by rules or by any special order, and the proceedings as against them shall be deemed to have begun only on the service of such summons or notice.

20. When there are numerous parties having the same interest in one action, one or more of such parties may sue or be sued, or may be authorised by the Court to defend in such action, on behalf or for the benefit of all parties so interested.

Pleading.

21. Unless the defendant in an action at the time of his appearance shall state that he does not require the delivery of a statement of complaint, the plaintiff shall, within such time and in such manner as may be directed by rules, deliver to the defendant after his appearance a statement of his complaint and of the relief or remedy to which he claims to be entitled. The defendant shall, within such time and in such manner as may be directed as aforesaid, deliver to the plaintiff a statement of his defence, set-off, or counterclaim (if any), and the plaintiff shall in like manner deliver a statement of his reply (if any) to such defence, set-off, or counter-claim. Such statements shall be as brief as the nature of the case will admit, and the Court in adjlisting the costs of the action shall inquire at the instance of any party into any unnecessary prolixity, and order the costs occasioned by such prolixity to be borne by the party chargeable with the same.

22. A defendant in an action may set off or set up by way of counter-claim against the claims of the plaintiff any right or claim, whether such set-off or counter-claim sound in damages or not, and such set-off or counter-claim shall have the same effect as a statement of claim in a cross action, so as to enable the Court to pronounce a final judgment in the same action, both on the original and on the cross claim. But the Court or Judge may, on the application of the plaintiff before trial, if in the opinion of the Court or Judge such set-off or counter-claim cannot be conveniently disposed of in the pending action, or ought not to be allowed, refuse permission to the defendant to avail himself thereof.

23. Every pleading shall, unless when otherwise provided by rules, contain as concisely as may be, a statement of the material facts on which the party pleading relies, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved, such statement being divided into paragraphs numbered consecutively, and each paragraph containing, as nearly as may be, a separate allegation. Dates, sums, and numbers shall be expressed in figures, and not in words. Signature of counsel shall not be necessary.

24. Every statement of claim shall state specifically the relief which the plaintiff claims, either simply or in the alternative, and may also ask for general relief; and the same rule shall apply to any counter-claim made or relief claimed by the defendant in his statement of defence. If the plaintiff's claim bo for discovery only, the plaintift's claim shall show it.

25. It shall not be sufficient for a defendant, unless where otherwise rules, in his defence to deny generally the facts alleged by the statement of a plaintiff in his reply to deny generally the facts [alleged in a defence counter-claim, but each party must deal specifically with each allegation of fact of which he does not admit the truth.

26. When a contract is alleged in any pleading, a bare denial of the contract by the opposite party shall be construed only as a denial of the making of the contract in fact, and not of its legality or its sufficiency in law, whether with reference to the Statute of Frauds, or otherwise.

27. Where in any action it appears to a Judge that the statement of claim or defence or reply does not sufficiently define the issues of fact in dispute between the parties, he may direct the parties to prepare issues, and such issues shall, if the parties differ, be settled by the Judge.

28. The Court or a Judge may, at any stage of the proceedings, allow either party to alter his statement of claim or defence or reply, or may order to be struck out or amended any matter in such statements respectively which may be scandalous or which may tend to prejudice, embarrass, or delay the fair trial of the action, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions or question in controversy between the parties; and all parties shall have also such further powers of amendment as may be prescribed by rules.

provided by claim, or for by a way of

Ch. 57.

395

29. A demurrer to any statement may be filed in such manner and form as may be prescribed by rules.

30. Where any action is brought to recover a debt or damages, any defendant may, at any time after service of the writ, and before or at the time of delivering his defence, or by leave of the Court or a Judge at any later time, pay into Court a sum of money by way of satisfaction or amends. Payment into Court shall be pleaded in the defence, and the claim or cause of action in respect of which such payment shall be made shall be specified therein.

31. The parties may, as may be directed by rules, after the writ of summons has been issued, concur in stating the questions of law arising in the action in the form of a special case for the opinion of the Court.

New Trial Motions.

32. A new trial shall not be granted on the ground of misdirection or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence unless, in the opinion of the Court to which the application is made, some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned in the trial of the action; and if it appear to such Court that such wrong or miscarriage affects part only of the matter in controversy, the Court may give final judgment as to part thereof, and direct a new trial as to the other part only, and a new trial may be ordered on any question in an action, whatever be the grounds for the new trial, without interfering with the finding or decision upon any other question.

A ppeals.

33. All appeals to the Court of Appeal shall be by way of re-hearing, and shall be brought by notice of motion in a summary way, and no petition, case, or other formal proceeding other than such notice of motion shall be necessary. The appellant may by such notice of motion appeal from the whole or any part of any judgment or order, and the notice of motion shall state whether the whole or part only of such judgment or order is complained of, and in the latter case shall specify such part.

34. The notice of appeal shall be served upon all parties directly affected by the appeal, and it shall not be necessary to serve parties not so affected; but the Court of Appeal may direct notice of the appeal to be served on all or any parties to the action or other proceeding, or upon any person not a party, and in the meantime may postpone or adjourn the hearing of the appeal upon such terms as may seem just, and may give such judgment and make such order as might have been given or made if the persons served with such notice had been originally parties. Any notice of appeal may be amended at any time as to the Court of Appeal may seem fit.

35. The Court of Appeal shall have all the powers and duties as to amendment and otherwise of the Court of First Instance, together with full discretionary power to receive further evidence upon questions of fact, such evidence to be either by oral examination in Court, by affidavit, or by deposition taken before an examiner or commissioner. Such further evidence may be given without special leave upon interlocutory applications, or in any case as to matters which have occurred after the date of the decision from which the appeal is brought. Upon appeals from a judgment after trial or hearing of any cause or matter upon the merits, such further evidence (save as to matters subsequent as aforesaid) shall be admitted on special grounds only, and not without special leave of the Court. The Court of Appeal shall have power to give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been made, and to make such further or other order as the case may require. The powers aforesaid may be exercised by the said Court, notwithstanding that the notice of appeal may be that part only of the decision may be reversed or varied, and such powers may also be exercised in favour of all or any of the respondents or parties, although such respondents or parties may not have appealed from or complained of the decision. The Court of Appeal shall have power to make such order as to the whole or any part of the costs of the appeal as may seem just.

36. It shall not under any circumstances be necessary for a respondent to give notice of motion by way of cross appeal, but if a respondent intends upon the hearing of the appeal to contend that the decision of the court below should be varied, he shall, within such time as may be prescril>ed by rules, give notice of such intention to any parties who may be affected by such contention. The omission to give such notice shall not diminish

the powers conferred by the Act upon the Court of Appeal, but may in the discretion of the Court be ground for an adjournment of the appeal, or for a special order as to costs.

(5.) The Local Authority may, if they think fit, withhold compensation if, in relation to the crop, the owner or the person having charge thereof, has, in their judgment, done anything in contravention of, or failed to do anything in compliance with, any Order under this Act.

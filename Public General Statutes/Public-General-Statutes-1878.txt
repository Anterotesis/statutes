CHAPTER 11.

An Act for the Regulation of Her Majesty's Royal Marine Porces while on shore. [16th April 1878.]

WHEREAS it is judged necessary for the safety of the United Kingdom, and the defence of the possessions of this realm, that a body of Royal Marine forces should be employed in Her Majesty's fleet and naval service, under the direction of the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom, or the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid:

And whereas the said forces may frequently be quartered or be on shore, or sent to do duty or be on board transport ships or merchant ships or vessels, or ships or vessels of Her Majesty, or other ships or vessels, or they may be under other circumstances in which they will not be subject to the laws relating to the government of Her Majesty's forces by sea:

And whereas no man can be forejudged of life or limb, or subjected in time of peace to any kind of punishment within this realm, by martial law, or in any other manner than by the judgment of his peers, and according to the known and established laws of this realm; yet nevertheless it being requisite for the retaining of such forces in their duty that an exact discipline be observed, and that marines who shall mutiny or stir up sedition, or shall desert Her Majesty's service, or be guilty of any other crime or offence in breach of or to the prejudice of good order and discipline, be brought to a more exemplary and speedy punishment than the usual forms of the law will allow:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L It shall be lawful for the said Lord High Admiral, or the Coin- Power to Lord missioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, Admiral, from time to time to make, ordain, alter, and establish rules and XnieL for the Articles of War, under the hand of the said Lord High Admiral, punishment of or under the hands of any two or more of the said Commissioners, mutiny, deser-for the better government of Her Majesty's Royal Marine forces, tLon> c' and for the punishment of mutiny, desertion, immorality, breach of discipline, misbehaviour, neglect of duty, and any other offence or misconduct of which they shall be guilty, in any place on shore or afloat in or out of Her Majesty's dominions, or at any time when or under any circumstances in which they shall not be amenable to the laws for the government of Her Majesty's ships, vessels, and forces by sea, and for regulating the proceedings of courts-martial, which rules and articles shall be judicially taken notice of by all judges and in all courts whatsoever; and copies of the same shall, as soon as conveniently may be after the same shall have been made, be transmitted by the Secretary of the Admiralty for the time being (certified under his hand) to the judges of Her Majesty's superior courts at Westminster, Dublin, and Edinburgh respectively, and also to the governors of Her Majesty's dominionsd abroad; provided that no person within the United Kingdom of Great Britain

An Act for the prevention of Accidents by Threshing Machines. [16th April 1878.]

WHEREAS by certain Acts of Parliament provision is made for the fencing of dangerous machinery in factories and mines, and it is expedient that similar provision should be made with respect to threshing machines:

Be it enacted by the. Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. The drum and feeding mouth of every threshing machine as defined by this Act shall at all times during the working thereof be kept sufficiently and securely fenced so far as is reasonably practicable and consistent with the due and;efficient working thereof.

If any person permits any threshing machine belonging to him or used for his service or benefit to be worked without its being fenced as aforesaid:

Or, if any foreman, engineer, or other person in charge of any threshing machine, works it or permits it to be worked without its being fenced as aforesaid:

Or, if any person during the working of any threshing machine removes any guard or thing used as a fence for any such machine: Every person so offending on any day shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding five pounds.

If in the prosecution of any person to whom the threshing machine belongs or for whose service or benefit it is used, it is shown that the machine was not in fact kept sufficiently and securely fenced during the working thereof, such person shall be deemed to have permitted the same unless he satisfy the court that he took all reasonable precautions to ensure the observance of this Act.

2. This Act shall not come into operation until the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine.'

This Act shall not extend to Scotland or Ireland.

3. On the prosecution of any person for an offence against this Act he may, on his own application, be sworn and examined as a witness.

4. Any constable may at any time enter on any premises on which he has reasonable cause to believe that a threshing machine is being worked contrary to the provisions of this Act, for the purpose of inspecting such machine.

5. In this Act " threshing machine " means a threshing machine which is worked by steam or by any motive power other than manual labour.

And whereas doubts have arisen as to the true effect and intention of the said enactment^ and as to whether the signature of the drawee alone can constitute a sufficient acceptance of the bill so as to satisfy the requirements of the said Statute, and it is expedient that the meaning of the said enactment should be farther declared:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L An acceptance of a bill of exchange is not and shall not be deemed to be insufficient under the provisions of the said Statutes by reason only that such acceptance consists merely of the signature of the drawee written on such bill.

2. Nothing in this Act shall affect the validity or invalidity of any verdict or judgment recovered or given before the passing of this Act.

3. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Bills of Exchange Act, 1878.

2. For the purpose of loans by the Public Works Loan Commissioners, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole six million pounds may be issued out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, or the growing produce thereof, in manner provided by the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, during the period ending on the thirtieth day of June one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, or on any earlier day at which a further Act authorising the issue of money for the purpose of the said loans comes into operation

The Treasury may, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided by the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, borrow the said sum or any part thereof.

3. Whereas, in pursuance of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the Acts amending the same, one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, being satisfied that the sewer authority for the special drainage district of Epping, in the county of Essex, had made default in providing their district with sufficient sewers and a supply of water, appointed a person to provide the same by means of certain works of drainage and water supply, and directed that the expenses of such works should be paid by the said authority, and certified that loans were required for the purpose of defraying those expenses, and charged the local rate with the repayment of the principal and interest due in respect of the said loans, and the Public Works Loan Commissioners advanced the amount of such loans:

And whereas the loans so advanced amount in the whole to a debt of eleven thousand nine hundred pounds, repayable by yearly instalments, with interest at five per cent, per annum:

And whereas the powers, property, and liabilities of the said sewer authority have become vested in and imposed on the rural sanitary authority of the Epping union:

And whereas the said sewer authority and rural sanitary authority refused to pay any sum in respect of the instalments or interest of the said debt, and alleged that the said works of drainage and water supply were useless:

And whereas the powers and duties vested in or imposed on one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State by the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the Acts amending the same, were transferred to and imposed on the Local Government Board by the Local Government Board Act, 1871:

And whereas Sir Joseph William Bazalgette, C.B., being requested by the Local Government Board to report as to the said works of drainage and water supply, and their value to the district, having regard to the insufficiency of the water supply whi<£ has been

Ch. 18.

obtained, and other matters, reported that in certain events the present waterworks would become most valuable to the Epping rural sanitary authority, but that, having regard to the difficulties of the case, and to the works of drainage remaining to be done, it appeared to him that the justice of the case would be met if the rural sanitary authority were charged with about one fourth of the cost of the works of water supply and two thirds of the cost of the drainage works, that is to say, five thousand pounds:

And whereas the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury by a letter dated the thirty-first day of December one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, offered the rural sanitary authority of the Epping union as a compromise to remit so much of the said debt as was in excess of the said sum of five thousand pounds:

And whereas such offer, when communicated by the Local Government Board to the rural sanitary authority; was rejected by that authority, and legal proceedings were taken by the Public Works Loan Commissioners to compel that authority to pay the instalments of and interest on part of the said debt, and the High Court of Justice ordered the said authority to pay the same:

And whereas the rural sanitary authority subsequently requested the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to renew the offer of the above-mentioned compromise on the ground that the sums required to be levied to repay the debt would be very oppressive if not ruinous to the ratepayers, and that the works were to a great extent useless, and the said Commissioners offered the same compromise on condition that the rural sanitary authority should, in addition to the said sum of five thousand pounds, pay interest thereon at the rate of four per cent, per annum from the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, and such further sum as might be necessary to cover the expenses entailed upon the Public Works Loan Commissioners by the refusal to accept the former offer:

And whereas the said interest and expenses amount to six hundred and twenty pounds, making a total of five thousand six hundred and twenty pounds, and the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury have further agreed to permit the total sum of five thousand six hundred and twenty pounds, with interest at four per cent, per annum from the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, to be paid by twenty equal annual instalments, the first instalment to be paid on the thirty-first day ot December one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight:

And whereas it is expedient to authorise the Public Works Loan Commissioners and the rural sanitary authority to carry into effect the said compromise: Be it therefore enacted as follows: The rural sanitary authority of Epping union, in the county of Essex, shall pay to the Public Works Loan Commissioners the sum of five thousand six hundred and twenty pounds, with interest thereon at four per cent, per annum from the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, and shall pay the same sum and interest by twenty annual instalments of four hundred and thirteen* pounds ten shillings and sevenpence, sfifeh instalments to be paid on the thirty-first day of December in the

year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, and in each succeeding year up to and including the year one thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven, and the said rural sanitary authority shall pay the Baid instalments out of any moneys or rates out of which they are authorised to defray special expenses incurred by them in relation to the said special drainage district under the Public Health Act, 1875, and shall from time to time raise such sums and issue precepts for such contributions as may be required for the purpose, and the overseers to whom those precepts are issued shall comply therewith, either by paying the amount out of the funds in their hands applicable to special expenses in relation to the said special drainage district, or by levying on the said district such rates as may be necessary for the purpose, and the precepts so issued and any rate levied to meet the same shall for all purposes be deemed to be issued and levied in respect of special expenses incurred by the said rural sanitary authority in relation to the said district, and may be enforced accordingly, and the payment of the said yearly instalments of four hundred and thirteen pounds ten shillings and sevenpence shall be enforceable by the Public Works Loan Commissioners in the same manner in all respects as if the said rural sanitary authority had executed a legal mortgage to the Public Works Loan Commissioners of the rates of the said special drainage district for securing the repayment of the said sum of five thousand six hundred and twenty pounds, with interest at the rate aforesaid, by the instalments herein-before mentioned, and after the commencement of this Act the said debt of eleven thousand nine hundred pounds, with all interest due thereon, shall be extinguished.

4. Whereas by section thirty-six of the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, the Local Government Board are required to satisfy themselves that any loan advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners on the security of a rate is applied to the purpose for which it is advanced, and are authorised to appoint any officer to conduct on their behalf such examination as they may think necessary with a view to ascertaining that the loan has been so applied, and it is expedient to make further provision with respect to the powers of the Local Government Board for the purposes of the said section: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Where upon any examination made in pursuance of section thirty-six of the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, with reference to a loan advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners for any purpose on the security of a rate, it appears to the Local Government Board that any sum, being the whole or part of the money raised by the loan, has not been applied for the said purpose, the Local Government Board may order that sum to be, within the time named in the order, applied either for the said purpose or towards the repayment to the Public Works Loan Commissioners of the principal of the loan, or partly in one of such ways and partly in the other, and further, if it appears to them that the sum, or any part thereof, has been applied for some purpose other than that for which it was advanced, may by the same or any other order direct a sum equal to the amount so misapplied to be raised within the time and out of the fund or rate named in the order and to be applied as directed by the above-mentioned order.

5. Whereas on the eighth day of October one thousand eight Cancellation hundred and forty-nine, a loan of four thousand five hundred and of debt due forty pounds was advanced by the Public Works Loan Commis- wi^n^Church. sioners, in pursuance of the Acts relating to loans by those Commissioners, towards the re-building of the pariah church of All

Saints in the parish of Wigan, in the county of Lancaster, and was to be repaid, with interest at the rate of four per cent, per annum, by equal annual instalments of two hundred and twenty-seven pounds, in twenty years from the aforesaid date:

And whereas the said loan was charged upon the church rates of the said parish of Wigan:

And whereas four of the said annual instalments only were repaid, amounting to the sum of nine hundred and eight pounds, and the remainder of the principal sum and large arrears of interest remain due and unpaid:

And whereas in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven proceedings were taken to enforce payment of the said principal and interest of the said loan, and in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six judgment was finally delivered in the House of Lords, whereby it was declared that in consequence of the lapse of time and change of circumstances the churchwardens and the church rates of the parish of Wigan were no longer liable to repay the said principal and interest, and it is expedient expressly to cancel the said loan in the books of the Public Works Loan Commissioners: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

So much of the loan advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners to the churchwardens of the parish of Wigan, in the county of Lancaster, in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-nine, as remains unpaid, and all arrears of interest due thereon, are hereby cancelled.

And whereas it is apprehended that deeds executed by married women under the provisions of the said Act may be liable to be invalidated by the circumstances that the Judge or Master in Chan-ceiy, or Chairman, or one or both of the Commissioners taking the acknowledgment, may be or may have been interested or concerned, either as a party or otherwise, in the transaction giving occasion for such acknowledgment, and it is not expedient that deeds executed in good faith under such circumstances shoulcLbe invalidated:

WHEREAS it was enacted by the fifth section of the Public 40 *41 Vict-Works Loans (Ireland) Act, 1877, that after the thirty-first * day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, advances should not be made out of the Consolidated Fund for the opening or maintenance of lunatic asylums, but no sufficient provision was made by the said Act for authorising presentments to be made by grand juries upon estimates of the expense necessary , for the maintenance of such asylums, nor for the apportionment of such expense between two or more counties, and it is necessary to make such provision:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same:

1. The inspectors of lunatics in Ireland shall, at such times in Expenses of each year and in such manner and form and for such period as the of

enforcing such Where it appears to a rural sanitary authority, on the report requirement. of their inspector of nuisances, or their medical officer of health, that any occupied dwelling-house within their district has not such supply within a reasonable distance, and the authority are of opinion that such supply can be provided at a reasonable cost not exceeding a capital sum the interest on which at the rate of five per centum per annum would amount to twopence per week, or at such other cost not exceeding a capital sum the interest on which at the rate of five per centum per annum would amount to threepence per week, as the Local Government Board may on the application of the local authority determine under all the circumstances of the case to be reasonable, and that the expense of providing the supply ought to be paid by the owner or defrayed as private improvement expenses, proceedings may be taken as follows:

(1.) The authority may serve on the owner of the house a notice requiring him, within a time specified in the notice and not exceeding six months from the date of the service thereof, to provide such supply, and to do all such works as may be necessary for that purpose.

(2.) If at the expiration of the time so specified the notice is not complied with, the authority may serve on the owner a second notice, informing him that if the requirements of the first notice are not complied with within month from the date of the service of the second notice, the

authority will themselves provide such supply, and that the expense of providing the supply will in that case be payable by the owner or as a private improvement

expense.

(3.) If at the expiration of one month from the date of the service of the second notice the requirements of the first notice are not complied with, the authority may, subject as in this Act is mentioned, themselves provide the Bupply, and for that purpose they may enter upon the premises and execute all such works as appear to them necessary for obtaining a supply of water for the house, and for the purposes of such entry sections 102 and 103,. of the Public ss & 89 Vict. Health Act, 1875, shall apply until the works are com- c- 55a pleted, in the same manner as if an order of a court of summary jurisdiction had been made for the abatement of a nuisance on the premises, and that order had not been complied with

(4.) Any expenses incurred by the authority in providing such -supply and doing such works may, when the supply has been provided, be recovered in a summary manner from the owner of the house, or may, at the option of the authority, be declared, by their order, to be private improvement expenses.

(5.) Where the owners of two or more houses have foiled to comply with the requirements of the notices served on them under this section, and the authority might, under this Act, execute the necessary works for providing a water Bupply for each bouse, the authority may, if it appears to them desirable, and no greater expense would be occasioned thereby, execute works for the joint supply of water to those houses, and apportion the expenses as they deem just.

The authority may, on cause being shown to their satisfaction why the requirements of a notice served by them under this section should not be complied with, withdraw the notice or modify the requirements thereof

Provided that nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to relieve the authority from the duty imposed upon them by the Public Health Act, 1875, of providing their district or any contribu- 88 & 89 Vict. tory place or part of a contributory place therein with a supply of °* S5' water in eases where danger arises to the health of the inhabitants from the insufficiency or unwholesomeness of the existing supply, and a general scheme of supply is required, and such supply can be got at a reasonable cost.

4. Where an owner of a house has been required by the notice Appeal by of a rural sanitary authority to provide a supply of water for his *3^*, house, and objects to such requirement on any of the following pro^Twater0 grounds; that is to say, supply.

(1.) That the supply is not required; or,

(2.) That the time limited by the notice for providing the supply is insufficient; or,

(3.) That it is impracticable to provide the supply at a reasonable Q cost; or.

(4.) That the authority ought themselves to provide a supply of water for the district or contributory place in which the house is situate, or to render the existing supply of water wholesome; or,

(5.) That the whole or part of the expense of providing the supply, or of rendering the existing supply wholesome, ought to be a charge on the district or contributory place; he may, within twenty-one days after service on him of the second notice, address a memorial to the authority, stating his objections, and in that case it shall not be lawful for the authority to proceed with the execution of the works which they might otherwise execute under this Act until they have been authorised to execute the same by a court of summary jurisdiction or by the Local Government Board in manner herein-after provided.

If the objections stated in the memorial do not include either the fourth or fifth of the above-mentioned grounds, the authority may apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for an order authorising them to proceed with the works, and thereupon the court shall summon the owner, and, if satisfied on hearing the case that the objections are not well founded, shall make an order authorising the authority to proceed with the works in the event of their not being executed by the owner within a time limited by the order.

If the objections stated in the memorial are or include the fourth and fifth of the above-mentioned grounds, or either of them, the authority shall forward a copy of the memorial to the Local Government Board, who may either cancel the requirement of the authority, or confirm the same, with or without modifications.

If the Local Government Board confirm the requirement they shall issue an order authorising the authority, subject to such modifications, if any, as they prescribe, to execute the works in the event of such works not being executed by the owner within a time limited by the order.

Any such order may, if the Local Government Board think it equitable so to do, apportion the expense of providing the supply between the owner of the house and the authority of the district comprising the contributory place in which the house is situate, or between the owner and any other person or persons.

If the Local Government Board cancel the requirement on the grounds that the authority ought themselves to provide a supply of water for the district or contributory place in which the house is situate, or to render the existing supply wholesome, the memorial shall be deemed to have been a complaint of default made to the Local Government Board against the authority under the 299th section of the Public Health Act, 1875.

5. Where the expenses of providing a joint supply of water for two or more houses are apportioned under this Act by a rural sanitary authority among the owners of the several houses, notice of such apportionment shall be forthwith given to each of such owners, and if any owner objects to the apportionment as unjust, be may, within twenty-one days after service on him of notice thereof, apply to a justice, and thereupon the justice may summon the authority, and also the other owners, to show cause before a court ofi^B^Jwy juris-

6. It shall not be lawful in any rural district for the owner of Houses in any dwelling-house which may be erected after the date of the com- ^aJ0d^trictB mencement of this Act, or of any dwelling-house which after that erected or redate may be pulled down to or below the ground floor and rebuilt, built without to occupy the same, or cause or permit the Bame to be occupied, ^ffl°ient water unless and until he has obtained from the sanitary authority of the 8Uppy' district a certificate that there is provided, within a reasonable distance of the house, such an available supply of wholesome water as

may appear to such authority, on the report of their inspector of nuisances or of their medical officer of health, to be sufficient for the consumption and use for domestic purposes of the inmates of the house.

If the sanitary authority refiise to grant such certificate, the owner may apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for an order authorising the occupation of the house notwithstanding the refusal of the certificate, and thereupon the court shall summon the authority, and if the court, after hearing the case, is of opinion that the certificate ought to have been granted, the court may make an order authorising the occupation of the house.

Any owner who occupies a house or causes or permits it to be occupied in contravention of this section shall be liable on conviction by a court of summary jurisdiction to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds

7. It shall be the duty of every rural sanitary authority from time Periodical into time to take such steps as may be necessary to ascertain the con- BPction8 of dition of the water supply within their district, and the authority water Bupp y' may pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by them for the purpose of taking such steps. The authority, or any of their officers,

or any person duly authorised in writing for that purpose by the authority, if they or he have or has reasonable ground for believing that any occupied dwelling-house within the district is without a proper supply of wholesome water, sufficient for the consumption and use for domestic purposes of the inmates of such house, shall be admitted into the premises for which such supply is required or from which the water supply may be derived for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not such house has such a supply within a reasonable distance; and for the purposes of any such admission sections 102 and 103 of the Public Health Act, 1875, shall apply in 88 & 89 Vict. the same manner as if such admission were necessary for the purpose * of examining as to the existence of any nuisance on the premises, and the person so authorised as aforesaid were an officer of the rural sanitary authority.

Where application is made to the Local Government Board Explanation by a local authority under section 62 of the Public Health Act, 1875, &6asvict to determine what is a reasonable cost within the meaning of that c. 55 as to the section, the Board may, for that purpose, fix, by order, a general meaning of scale of charges for the whole or any part of the district of the local onable authority, and the cost of the supply of water to any house within

the area specified in the order shall be deemed to be determined to be a reasonable cost within the meaning of that section ifQt^ does not exceed the cost authorised by such general scale of charges.

Provided that if any such dwelling-house has, within a reasonable distance, and from other sources, a supply of wholesome water sufficient for the consumption and use of the inmates of the house, no water rate or water rent shall be recoverable from the owner or occupier of the house unless and until the water supplied by the authority by means of such stand-pipes is used by inmates of the house.

10.

(4.) He shall expunge the name of every person who, whether objected to or not, is proved to the revising barrister to be dead:

(o.) Where an entry in any list and an entry in a return made to the overseers of deaths appear to relate to the same person, the revising barrister shall inquire whether such entries relate to the same person, and on proof being made to him that the entries relate to the same person shall expunge the entry in the list therefrom:

(6.) The revising barrister shall expunge the name of every person, whether objected to or not, whose name or place of abode, or the nature of whose qualification, or the name or situation of whose qualifying property if the qualification is in respect of property, or any other particulars respecting whom by law required to be stated, in the list, is or are either wholly omitted or in the judgment of the revising barrister insufficiently described for the purpose of being identified, unless the matter or matters so omitted or insufficiently described be supplied to the satisfaction of the revising barrister before he shall have completed the revision of the list in which the omission or insufficient description occurs, and in case such matter or matters shall be so supplied, he shall then and there insert the same in such list:

(7.) He shall expunge the name of every person, whether objected to or not, where it is proved to the revising barrister that such person was, on the last day of July then next preceding, incapacitated by any law or statute from voting at an election for the parliamentary borough or an election for the municipal borough, as the case may be, to which the list relates:

(8.) Before expunging from a list the name of any person not objected to, the revising barrister shall cause such notice, if any, as shall appear to him necessary or proper under the circumstances of the proposal to expunge the name, to be given to or left at the usual or last known place of abode of such person:

(9.) Subject as herein and otherwise bylaw provided, the revising barrister shall retain the name of every person not objected to, and also of every person objected to, unless the objector appears by himself or by some person on his behalf in support of his objection:

(10.) If the objector so appears the revising barrister shall require him, unless he is an overseer, to prove that he gave the notice or notices of objection required by law to be given by him, and to give prim& facie proof of the ground of objection, and for that purpose may himself examine and allow the objector to examine the overseers or any pother c) person on oath touching the alleged ground of objection, and unless such proof is given to his satisfaction shall, sub-

Oh. 26. Parlicmerdary and Municipal Registration. 41 & 42 Vict.

ject as herein and otherwise by law provided, retain the name of the person objected to:

An objection made under this Act by overseers shall be deemed to cast upon the person objected to the burden of proving his right to be on the list:

The primfi, facie proof shall be deemed to be given by the objector if it is shown to the satisfaction of the revising barrister by evidence, repute, or otherwise that there is reasonable ground for believing that the objection is well founded, and that by reason of the person objected to not being present for examination, or for some other reason, the objector is prevented from discovering or proving the truth respecting the entry objected to:

(11.) If such proof is given by the objector as herein prescribed, or if the objection is*by overseers, then unless the person objected to appears by himself or by some person.on his behalf, and proves that he was entitled on the last day of July then next preceding to have his name inserted in the list in respect of the qualification described in such list, the revising barrister shall expunge the name of the person objected to:

(12.) Where the matter stated in a list or claim, or proved to the revising barrister in relation to any alleged right to be on any list, is in the judgment of the revising barrister insufficient in law to constitute a qualification of the nature or description stated or claimed, but sufficient in law to constitute a qualification of some other nature or description, the revising barrister, if the name is entered in a list for which such true qualification in law is appropriate, shall correct such entry by inserting such qualification accordingly, and in any other case shall insert the name with such qualification in the appropriate list, and shall expunge it from the other list, if any, in which it is entered:

(13.) Except as herein provided, and whether any person is objected to or not, no evidence shall be given of any other qualification than that which is described in the list or claim, as the case may be, nor shall the revising barrister be at liberty to change the description of the qualification as it appears in the list except for the purpose of more clearly and accurately defining the same:

(14.) Where the name of any person appears to be entered more than once as a parliamentary voter on the lists of voters for the same parliamentary borough, or more than once as a burgess on the burgess lists for the same municipal borough, the revising barrister shall inquire whether such entries relate to the same person, and on proof being made to him that such entries relate to the same person shall retain one of the entries for voting, and place against the other or others a note to the effect that the person is not entitled to vote in respect of the qualification therein contained for the parliamentary borough or)^$be municipal borough, as the case may be, he being on the list for voting in respect of another qualification:

219

1878. Pwliomentary and Mumdpal Registration. Ch. 26.

Any such person may, by notice in writing delivered to the revising barrister at the opening of his first revision court, select the entry to be retained for voting, and in making such selection may select one entry to be retained for voting for the parliamentary borough, and another entry to be retained for voting as a burgess for the municipal borough, but if he does not make any selection the entry to be so retained shall be selected by the revising barrister, except in the case of freemen, in which case the entry to be retained by the revising barrister for voting shall be that on the freemen's list:

If any question on appeal, or otherwise, arise as to the validity of the qualification for which the parliamentary voter or burgess is on the list for voting, recourse may be had for supporting the right of the voter or burgess to be on the parliamentary register or burgess roll for voting to any other qualification of such person appearing on the register or burgess roll:

Provided always, that in the case of a municipal borough divided into wards a vote given in or the right to vote in one ward shall not be supported by a qualification appearing on the burgess roll for some other ward:

(15.) Where a list is made out in divisions the revising barrister shall place the name of any person in the division in which it should appear according to the result of the revision, regard being had to the title of the person to be on the list both as a parliamentary voter and as a burgess, or only in one of those capacities, and shall expunge the name from the other division (if any) in which it appears.

Note (P.)

Directions for the Guidance of Overseers in making out

the Lists.

The following directions should be observed by overseers in making out the lists of Parliamentary voters and burgesses, and also the lists of claimants and persons objected to as Parliamentary voters and burgesses.

(1.) The surname and other name or names of each person are to be written at full length, the surname being placed first.

(2.) Each list, and where the list is made out in divisions, each division of each list should be made out in alphabetical order.

(3.) The place of abode should be entered wtyh the name of the street, lane, or other locality, and the number in such street, lane, or other locality of such place of abode, where there is any such name or number, and should be entered in all cases in such a manner as will afford a full and sufficient address for a person entered if a letter is addressed to him by post.

(4.) The nature of the qualification should be entered as nearly as possible in the words of the statute conferring the franchise, for instance: —

(a.) The nature of the qualification of a person under the Reform Act, 1832 (2 & 3 Will. 4. c. 45), or under the Municipal Corporation Acts, should be stated thus: " house," or in 'the case of a joint occupation, " house (joint)," or "warehouse," " counting-house," " shop," or " building," or in the manner provided by the Parliamentary and Municipal Registration Act, 1878, as the case may be:

(b.) The nature of the qualification of a person under section 3 of the Representation of the People Act, 1867, should be stated thus, " dwelling-house."

(5.) The name and situation of the qualifying property, if the qualification is in respect of property, shouldy «e entered with the name of the street, lane, or other locality, and the number in such street, lane, or other locality of such property, where there is any

1878. Parliamentary and Municipal Registration. CH. 26.

such name or number, and should be entered in all cases in such a manner as will afford full and sufficient means of identifying such property.

(6.) Where several qualifications are possessed by the same person, the particulars respecting each qualification should be stated in the list; and in the case of a list made out in divisions, where a person is entered in Division 1 in respect of one qualification for Parliamentary purposes, and in respect of another qualification for municipal purposes, each such qualification should be distinguished in the list by a note to the effect that the qualification is for Parliamentary purposes only, or for municipal purposes only, as the case may be.

(7.) In making out the list of lodger claimants who claim on or before the Twenty-fifth day of July, and are then on the register in respect of the same lodgings, if you have reason to believe that any person whose name is entered on that list is dead, or is not entitled to vote, you should make a note to that effect in the last column of the list, being the column headed * Objections by overseers."

(8.) You should omit from any list of Parliamentary voters or burgesses the name of any person who appears from the returns furnished by the registrar of births and deaths to be dead, and the name of any person who is ascertained to be disqualified for being inserted in the list by reason of having received parochial relief or other alms.

Note (Q.)

Directions for Guidance in the formation of the Parliamentary Register and Burgess Roll.

In copying and printing Divisions 1 and 2 for the Parliamentary Register, and Divisions 1 and 3 for the Burgess Roll, of any revised list made out in divisions under this Act, the two divisions in each set may, and, if and so far as the local authority under the Act shall so direct, shall be combined or kept separate, and be arranged according to convenience for use in parts for polling districts or wards, and where the polling districts and wards are not conterminous in such manner that the parts may be conveniently compiled or put together to serve either as lists for polling districts or as ward lists; and the names may, and, if and so far as the said local authority shall so direct, shall be distinguished by a number either alone, or in combination with a letter or other distinguishing mark according to the parts, and any arrangement may, and, if and so far as the said local authority shall so direct, shall be adopted according to convenience, so that one print or edition of Division 1 may be available for both sets.

Each entry for voting on the Parliamentary register of every Parliamentary borough, and on the burgess roll of every municipal borough whose burgess lists are revised under this Act, is to be distinguished by a number, either alone or in combination with a letter or distinguishing mark.

Any entry of a person not entitled to vote in respect of the qualification therein contained, he being on the list for voting in respect of another qualification, is to be denoted by an asterisk in the manner provided by section forty-seven of the Parliamentary Registration Act, 1843, with respect to similar entries in the registers for counties.

The officer having the custody of any revised lists under this Act shall permit access thereto for the purpose of the same being copied for the Parliamentary register of the Parliamentary borough, and for the Burgess Roll of any municipal borough to which such revised lists relate.

CHAPTER 47.

An Act to enable the Trustees of the Elders Widows' Fund to apply the Capital of the said Fund in aid of Income; and for other purposes in relation thereto.

[8th August 1878.]

WHEREAS in the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty a fund, commonly known as " The Elders Widows* Fund," was established for the relief of the widows and orphans of persons employed in the Extra Department of the Home Service of the East India Company:

And whereas upon the establishment of the said fund the East India Company agreed to grant a contribution of one thousand pounds a year in aid of the fund, and such contribution is now payable by the Secretary of State for India in Council:

And whereas for some years after the establishment of the said fund the income thereof was more than sufficient to meet its current liabilities, and the surplus income was accordingly invested and accumulated for the benefit of the fund:

And whereas in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four it was apprehended that, by reason of reductions in the home establishment of the East India Company, consequent upon the Act of the third and fourth William the Fourth, chapter eighty-five, the said fund would prove inadequate to meet the payments provided for by the then existing regulations thereof, and thereupon, at the request of the trustees of the said fund, it was resolved by the Court of Directors of the East India Company, with the sanction of the Commissioners for the Affairs of India, that the deficiency should be made good by the East India Company as compensation under the seventh section of the said Act, on condition that, if the capital of the said fund and the income thereof from interest and subscriptions should he more than sufficient to provide for the permanent charge of'pensions, the excess should be appropriated, so far as it would go, to repay to the East India Company the advances which they might make under that arrangement, together with interest:

And whereas on the seventeenth of May one thousand eight hundred and sixty the said fund was closed, and since that date no fresh subscribers have been admitted:

1878. Elders Widoivs' Fund. Cft. 47.

And whereas the advances made by the East India Company and the Secretary of State for India in Council, under the said arrangement of one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four, have amounted to upwards of nineteen thousand pounds:

And whereas the invested capital of the said hind standing in the names of the trustees thereof now consists of the sum of twenty-two thousand eight hundred and sixty-three pounds nine shillings and fourpence New Three per1 Cent. Annuities:

And whereas the Secretary of State for India in Council has lately caused an investigation to be made into the assets and liabilities of the said fund, and it appears by the report of the actuary employed in such investigation that, if the annual contribution in aid of the fund payable by the Secretary of State for India in Council be reduced to five hundred pounds a year, the trustees of the said fund will probably be able to meet all the liabilities thereof by means of the income of the fund and the appropriation from time to time of portions of the invested capital thereof:

And whereas in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven a fund, entitled the India Office Provident Fund, was established for the relief of the widows and orphans of persons on the permanent home establishment of the Secretary of State for India in Council, and it was provided by the rules of the said fund that the subscribers to the Elders Widows' Fund who were in the service at the date of the establishment of the Provident Fund should be entitled to become subscribers to the Provident Fund in case an Act of Parliament should be passed enabling the trustees of the Elders Widows' Fund to transfer to the account of the Provident Fund such a portion of - the invested capital of the Elders Widows' Fund as should, in the opinion of an actuary to be named by the Secretary of State for India in Council, represent the claims on the Elders Widows' Fund, as upon the twenty-sixth of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven, of the subscribers to that fund who might have elected to become subscribers to the Provident Fund, and that upon such transfer being made, the latter fund should alone be liable for the payment of pensions to the widows and orphans of the subscribers to the Elders Widows Fund who should have elected to become subscribers to the Provident Fund: And whereas thirty-six subscribers to the Elders Widows' Fund have elected to become subscribers to the Provident Fund, and a valuation has accordingly been made of their claims upon the Elders Widows' Fund as upon the twenty-sixth of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven, and such valuation amounts to the sum of three thousand three hundred and seventeen pounds eight shillings and sixpence:

And whereas it is expedient that provision should be made for the transfer to the account of the Provident Fund of the said mm of three thousand three hundred and seventeen pounds eight shillings and sixpence, together with interest thereon at the rate of fovur pounds per cent per annum from the twenty-sixth of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven to the date of the osL&sing of this Act, and for the gradual extinction of the invested capital of the Elders Widows' Fund, with due regard to all existingo Ln terests, and for the transfer- to. the Secretary of State for India

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. The trustees of the Elders Widows' Fund shall, upon the passing of this Act, transfer to the account of the India Office Provident Fund so much of the said sum of twenty-two thousand eight hundred and sixty-three pounds nine shillings and fourpence New Three per Cent. Annuities, now standing in their names, as shall be equivalent, at the medium price of the day of the passing of this Act, to the said sum of three thousand three hundred and seventeen pounds eight shillings and sixpence, with interest thereon at the rate aforesaid from the twenty-sixth of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven to the date of the passing of this Act

2. Upon such transfer being made, the India Office Provident Fund shall alone be liable to the claims of those subscribers to the Elders Widows' Fund who have elected to subscribe to the India Office Provident Fund.

3. The annual contribution in aid of the Elders Widows' Fund payable by the Secretary of State for India in Council shall be reduced to five hundred pounds a year as from the thirty-first of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight.

4. The trustees of the Elders Widows' Fund shall from time to time, until the liabilities of the said fund are satisfied or the invested capital thereof is exhausted, raise, by sale of sufficient portions of such invested capital, such an amount as may be from time to time required, in addition to the income of the fund, to meet the current liabilities thereof.

Imperial Standards.

The following standards were constructed under the direction of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, after the destruction of the former imperial standards in the fire at the Houses of Parliament.

The imperial standard for determining the length of the imperial standard yard is a solid square bar, thirty-eight inches long and one inch square in transverse section, the bar being of bronze or gun-metal; near to each end a cylindrical hole is sunk (the distance between the centres of the two holes being thirty-six inches) to the depth of half an inch, at the bottom of this hole is inserted in a smaller hole a gold plug or pin, about one tenth of an inch in diameter, and upon the surface of this pin there are cut three fine lines at intervals of about the one hundredth part of an inch transverse to the axis of the bar, and two lines at nearly the same interval parallel to the axis of the bar; the measure of length of the imperial standard yard is given by the interval between the middle transversal line at one end and the middle transversal line at the other end, the part of each line which is employed being the point midway between the longitudinal lines; and the said points are in this Act referred to as the centres of the said gold plugs or pins; and such bar is marked " copper 16 oz., tin 2\, zinc 1. Mr. Bally's metal. No. 1 standard " yard at 62° *00 Fahrenheit. Cast in 1845. Troughton & Simms, London."

The imperial standard for determining the weight of the imperial standard pound is of platinum, the form being that of a cylinder nearly 1 '35 inch in height and 1*15 inch in diameter, with a groove or channel round it, whose middle is about 0*34 inch below the top of the cylinder, for insertion of the points of the ivory fork by which it is to be lifted; the edges are carefully rounded off, and such standard pound is marked, P.S. 1844, lib.

CHAPTER 53.

An Act to facilitate improvements in the Organisation of the Admiralty and War Office by the retirement of Clerks from certain of the Civil Departments thereof.

[13th August 1878.]

WHEREAS by an Order of Her Majesty the Queen in Council, dated the twelfth day of February one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, a lower division of clerks in the permanent Civil Service of the State was constituted, and it was further ordered therein that no department throughout Her Majesty's Civil Service should be permanently increased or regulated afresh without providing for the introduction of a system whereby such of its duties as were of a suitable character should be performed by members of such lower division:

And whereas it has become necessary to regulate afresh certain civil departments of the Admiralty and of the Secretary of State for War, and in making such regulation regard has been had to the requirements of the said Order with respect to the introduction of clerks of the lower division, and an immediate reduction has thereby been effected in the expense of the said departments:

And whereas the introduction of such clerks as last aforesaid involves a considerable reduction in the existing staff of clerks; and with a view to bring the new regulation into effect with the least possible delay, it is expedient that exceptional facilities should be given for the retirement of such members of the said departments as the Commissioners of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War may select for that purpose:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

Power to pay gratuities to retiring clerks in the Admiralty and War Office.

Limitation of amount of gratuity.

Award of Gratuities.

L The Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury may at any time or times before the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty, but not after that date, by warrant under the hands of any two of the Commissioners, addressed to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, authorise the payment to such clerks of the departments of the Admiralty and of the Secretary of State for War respectively as may be in the said warrant named of the several sums therein set opposite their names, and therein stated to have been awarded to them by the Commissioners of the Treasury as special gratuities on their retirement or removal from office in pursuance of the regulation of the departments to which they respectively belong.

2. A gratuity awarded under this Act to any clerk shall be estimated according to the period during which such clerk has served in a qualifying class as defined by this section, and shall be limited as follows; that is to say, it shall not exceed in the whole the sum of one thousand pounds, and itzshall not exceed the sum of fifty pounds for each year and a proportionate part for any

1878.

Admiralty and War Office Regulation.

Ch. 53.

portion of a year during which such clerk has served in a qualifying class up to the date of the warrant in which his name is contained.

40 & 41 Vict. e. 58.

An Act to amend the Prison Acts of 1877, so far as regards the Apportionment of certain Superannuation Allowances between the Treasury and the Local Authorities.

[16th August 1878.]

WHEREAS by the sections of the Prison Acts of 1877 mentioned in the First Schedule to this Act, it is provided that an annuity by way of superannuation allowance granted to an existing officer of a prison as mentioned in those sections shall be apportioned as therein mentioned, and one portion thereof shall be paid by the local authority out of the rates therein mentioned, and the residue out of moneys provided by Parliament:

And whereas in many cases the amount payable under the said apportionment, either by the local authority out of the rates or by the Treasury out of moneys provided by Parliament, will be very small, and it is expedient to provide for the commutation of such amount; that is to say, for the payment by the Treasury to the local authority, or by the local authority to the Treasury, of the capital value of their share of the annuity, so that the grantee of such annuity may receive the whole of it from one source only:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Prison (Officers Superannuation) Short title Act, 1878.

2. Where an annuity granted by way of superannuation allowance to an existing officer of a prison under the sections of the Prison Acts mentioned in the First Schedule to this Act is apportioned to be paid partly by the Treasury out of moneys provided by Parliament and partly by the local authority out of rates, the Treasury and the local authority may agree for the commutation of the share of the annuity apportioned to either of them; that is to say, for the payment by that one to the other of them of the capital value of of Pri80n-such share ascertained according to the tables contained in the Second Schedule to this Act.

Where the share of the annuity apportioned to be paid by the Treasury is less than twenty pounds a year, the Treasury may require the local authority to accept commutation of that share.

Commutation by prison authority or Treasury of apportioned part of superannuation allowance to existing officer

Payment and application of amount of commutation.

Provision as to local authorities contributing to annuity.

Definitions.

40 & 41 Vict. c. 21.

Ch. 63. Prison (Officers Superannuation) Act, 1878. 41 &42 Vict.

In the case of an annuity as to which the Treasury make no such requirement, the local authority may require the Treasury to accept commutation of the share apportioned to be paid by the load authority.

The Treasury or the local authority, on receiving payment under any agreement, or payment or tender under any requirement, of the sum for commutation of the share of an annuity, shall in every year raise and pay that share to the annuitant out of the same moneys or rates and in the like manner as the rest of the annuity, and the payers or tenderers of the said sum shall be free from all liability in respect of such annuity.

3. Any sum paid by the Treasury to the local authority for commutation of a share of an annuity shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, and shall be applied in such manner as the local authority direct in aid of the rates out of which the annuity is payable, and may, if the local authority so direct, be invested in the name of the local authority, or of their clerk, in any securities in which trustees are for the time being authorised by law to invest, and such investment may be from time to time sold, and the proceeds of such sale and the income arising from the investment may be applied from time to time as the local authority direct in aid the said rates.

Any sum paid to the Treasury by the local authority for. commutation of a share of an annuity shall be paid out of the rates out of which the said share is payable, and shall be paid into the Exchequer.

4. Where two or more local authorities are liable to pay shares of the same annuity to an officer of a prison, each of those authorities shall be deemed to be a local authority for the purposes of this Act, but any such local authority shall not be entitled to require the Treasury to accept commutation of the share of an annuity if the Treasury have already commuted the share of that annuity payable by the Treasury.

The said local authorities may agree together for the commutation of the share of any such annuity which is payable by either of them, and the provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly.

5. For the purposes of this Act —

The expression " Treasury " means the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury.

The expression " local authority " means —

(a.) as regards England, the prison authority within the meaning of the Prison Act, 1877; and (6.) as regards Scotland, the Commissioners of Supply of the county or the magistrates of a burgh; and (c.) as regards Ireland, the grand jury of a county or a town council having the powers of a grand jury.

The expression "clerk of a local authority" means, as regards Ireland, the secretary of the grand jury, or in the case of a town council the town clerk, and such secretary shall for the purpose of an investment made in pursuance of thi| Act, be a corporation sole.

The expression " rates " includes any rates, assessment, cess, or other funds out of which a share of the annuity is payable by a local authority in pursuance of the Acts mentioned in the First Schedule to this Act.

CHAPTER 6.

An Act to amend the Acts relating to Cattle Disease in Ireland.

[21st May 1874.]

WHEREAS by " The Cattle Disease Act (Ireland), 1866, power was given to the Lord Lieutenant or other chief governor or governors in Ireland, in the manner in the said Act mentioned, to make such orders and regulations as to him or them might seem necessary for the more effectually preventing the spreading of contagious or infectious disease amongst cattle, and for the other purposes in the said Act mentioned; and by the said Act provision was made for defraying the expenses necessary for the purpose of carrying the said Act into execution, and for other purposes in the said Act mentioned, by means of a rate to be assessed, subject to the limitations and in the manner prescribed by the said Act, upon the several Poor Law unions in Ireland in proportion to the net annual value of the rateable property therein, according to the valuation in force for the time being:

And whereas by the said Act provision was made in case the amount so assessed should be insufficient that such further sums as should be required should be raised by means of further rates to be assessed subject to the limitations and in the manner prescribed by the said Act; and in case occasion should not arise for the application to the purposes aforesaid of the whole or any part of any moneys so raised, then that all such moneys, or the remaining balance of the same, should be paid over to the treasurers of the said Poor Law unions, and be applied in manner provided by the said Act:

And whereas the purposes to which such moneys might be applied under the authority of the said Act were extended, and the said Act was amended by " The Cattle Disease (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1870

And whereas under the authority and for the purposes of the first-recited Act a certain sum of ^money was raised, but inasmuch as there was only occasion to expend for the said purposes a part of such sum, the balance was paid over to the treasurers of the said unions respectively, as provided by the said Act:

And whereas a further sum being now required to be raised for the purposes of the said Act, doubts have arisen whether the powers in that behalf conferred by the recited Acts apply to and include cases where a portion of the previous levy has been paid over to the treasurers of unions, and it is expedient such doubts should be removed:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queens most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1874.

Cattle Disease (Ireland).

Ch. 6, 7.

[Short title.]

1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as "The Cattle Disease (Ireland) Acts Amendment Act, 1874," and the recited Acts and this Act may be cited for all purposes as "The Cattle Disease (Ireland) Acts, 1866-1874."

2. It is hereby declared that the provisions of section Amendment of thirteen of "The Cattle Disease Act (Ireland), 1866," extend

and. apply to each and every case in which, for the purposes c# 4# , c ' of carrying into execution The Cattle Disease (Ireland) Acts,

1866-1874 *, and for the purposes therein mentioned, any sum of money shall be required, whether such case shall arise after the disbursement of any sum or sums raised under the provisions of the said Acts, or any of them, or after the repayment of any such sum or sums, or any part thereof, to the treasurers of Poor Law unions under the said provisions.

Provided always, that no certificate or order under the authority of the said section thirteen of "The Cattle Disease Act (Ireland), 1866," shall authorise the assessment at any one time of more than one halfpenny in the pound on the net annual value of the rateable property in any Poor Law union, according-to the valuation in force for the time being.

CHAPTER 7.

An Act to amend the Law respecting the payment of the Assistant Judge of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace for the county of Middlesex, and his deputy, and the Chairman of the Second Court at such Sessions.

[21st May 1874.]

WHEREAS under the enactments specified in the third column of the first schedule to this Act power is given to Her Majesty to appoint an Assistant Judge of the court of the sessions of the peace for the county of Middlesex, but the provision made by the said enactments for the payment of such judge has determined by reason of the resignation of the person who recently held the office of such Assistant Judge: And whereas under the said enactments the Assistant Judge is required, whenever the court of the sessions of the peace for the county of Middlesex divide the court, to appoint a person to preside as chairman with the justices appointed to sit apart in the second court, but no provision is thereby made for the payment of such chairman:

And whereas it is expedient to make provision, in manner herein appearing, for the payment of the said Assistant Judge and chairman, and for the appointment and payment of the deputy of such Assistant Judge:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords

CHAPTER 12.

An Act to make provision for the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the Bengal and Madras Civil Service Annuity Funds, and the Annuity Branch of the Bombay Civil Fund, to the Secretary of State for India in Council.

[8th June 1874.]

WHEREAS an institution, known as the Bengal Civil Service Annuity Fund, was established in India, under the authority given by the Court of Directors of the East India Company in a public despatch to the Governor General in Council at Fort William in Bengal, dated the eighth of December one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four, for the grant of annuities to the civil servants of the said Company, on their retiring from the service, who should become subscribers to the said institution; and whereas another institution, known as the Madras Civil Service Annuity Fund, founded on certain annuity funds of earlier dates, was established iu Madras, under the authority given by the said Court of Directors in a public despatch to the Governor in Council at Fort St. George, dated the thirty-first of December one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four, for the grant of similar annuities; and whereas another institution, known as

East India Annuity Funds.

37 Vict.

Assets and liabilities of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay Civil Funds to be transferred to Secretary of State.

the Annuity Branch of the Bombay Civil Fund, founded on an annuity fund of earlier date, was established in Bombay, under the authoritjr given by the said Court of Directors in a public despatch to the Governor in Council at Bombay, dated the thirty-first of December one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four, the said Annuity Branch having a separate capital for the grant of annuities like the Bengal and Madras Annuity Funds; and the said Civil Annuity Funds were supported by the subscriptions of the civil servants of the said Company and by certain contributions from the said Company:

And whereas, in a financial despatch to the Government of India, dated the tenth of February one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, certain changes respecting the grant of annuities were authorised by the Secretary of State for India in Council, which, taken in connexion with other changes which had been previously made also under the authority of the said Secretary of State for India in Council, rendered the continuance of the machinery of the Bengal, Madras, and Bombay Civil Annuity Funds unnecessary:

And whereas, in accordance with the instructions contained in the aforesaid despatch the Government of India caused the inquiry to be made whether, upon the terms respecting the grant of annuities offered by the Secretary of State in the said despatch, the subscribers to the said Civil Annuity Funds were willing to surrender the accumulated annuity capital of the said Funds to the Secretary of State for India in Council; and the proposition so to make over the accumulated annuity capital on the terms offered by the Secretary of State was carried in the affirmative by the subscribers to the Bengal, Madras, and Bombay Civil Annuity Funds by a large majority of votes:

And whereas, in order to avoid any doubt that may arise in regard to the legality of such transfer, it is necessary to make provision by law for enabling the trustees of the said Civil Annuity Funds to transfer the assets and liabilities thereof, including the assets and liabilities herein-after referred to, to the Secretary of State for India in Council, and for enabling the Secretary of State for India in Council to accept the same:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. It shall be lawful for the trustees of the Bengal Civil Service Annuity Fund, and of the Madras Civil Service Annuity Fund, and of the Annuity Branch of the Bombay Civil Fund to transfer to the Secretary of State for India in Council the assets and liabilities of the Bengal, Madras, and Bombay Civil Annuity Funds, including any assets and liabilities to

which the trustees of the Madras and Bombay Civil Annuity Funds may have succeeded as representing the trustees of the earlier funds at Madras and Bombay, and for the Secretary of State for India in Council to accept the same.

Funds shall be deemed to be liabilities of the revenues of India, and all such liabilities may be enforced against the Secretary of State for India in Council in like manner as they might have been enforced against the trustees of the said Funds if this Act had not been passed; and every civil servant who shall at the date of such notification be aib incumbent of an annuity from any of the said Civil Annuity Funds, or from any earlier fund the assets and liabilities of which shall have been transferred as aforesaid, shall be entitled to receive from time to time the amount of such annuity from the revenues of India; and every covenacted civil servant who shall be a subscriber to any of the said Civil Annuity Funds at or after the date of such notification shall be entitled on retirement to the benefits granted by the despatch of the Secretary of State in Council to the Government of India, dated the tenth of February one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one; namely,

If he shall have completed twenty-five years service and twenty-one years residence in India a full annuity of one thousand pounds payable in England, or Company's rupees ten thousand six hundred and sixty-six ten annas and eight pies payable in Bengal, or Company's rupees ten thousand six hundred and fifty payable in Madras or Bombay:

And if he shall be compelled to resign the service on account of ill health, clearly proved by medical certificate,

If under five years service, a grant of five hundred pounds;

If of five years service and under six, an invalid annuity of one hundred and fifty pounds;

If of six years service and under seven, an invalid annuity of one hundred and seventy pounds; and so on, an increase of twenty pounds being made to the annuity for each year's service, the highest invalid annuity being four hundred and fifty pounds for a service of twenty years.

3. Provided that nothing in this Act contained shall pre- Nothing to judice any claim which may be made by any'subscriber to the prejudice snb-said Civil Service Annuity Funds, or by the representatives of 8Cn era ims* any such subscriber, upon the funds so transferred; and in case any question shall arise between any such subscriber or the representatives of any deceased subscriber on the one

hand, and the Secretary of State for IndiaT in Council on the other, as to any liability or alleged liability of the said funds, such question shall be determined by the Court of Appeal appointed by the Judicature Act, 1873, in such manner as may be provided by any general orders, or as the said court may, on special application, think fit to prescribe, anything in the Statute of Limitations to the contrary notwithstanding.

sixty-two, it was provided that it should be lawful for Her Majesty to make such rules as to the leave of absence of Indian bishops on furlough or medical certificate as might seem to Her expedient: And whereas it was further provided that the provisions of existing Acts of Parliament should not be interfered with by such rules so far as regarded the present Bishop of Calcutta: And whereas the present Bishop of Calcutta has intimated his desire to be brought under such rules:

2.

manner as the licensing justices direct, and shall be in force until the same is revoked; the expense of any such advertisement may be defrayed in like manner as the expenses of advertising the sittings of such justices are defrayed.

7. Where, on the occasion of any application for a new license, or the removal or renewal of a license which authorises the sale of any intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises, the applicant applies to the licensing justices to insert in his license a condition that he shall close the premises in respect of which such license is or is to be granted one hour earlier at night than that at which such premises would otherwise have to be closed, the justices shall insert the said condition in such license.

The holder of a license in which such condition is inserted (in this Act referred to as an early-closing license) shall close his premises at night one hour earlier than the ordinary hour at which such premises would be closed under the provisions of this Act, and the provisions of this Act and the principal Act shall apply to the premises as if such earlier hour were the hour at winch the premises are required to be closed.

10. Nothing in this Act or in the principal Act contained Saving as to shall preclude a person licensed to sell any intoxicating liquor

to be consumed on the premises from selling such liquor at lodgers, any time to bona fide travellers or to persons lodging in his house: Provided that no person holding a six-day license shall sell any intoxicating liquor on Sunday to any person whatever not lodging in his house.

Nothing in this Act contained as to hours of closing shall preclude the sale at anj^ time, at a railway station, of intoxicating liquors to persons arriving at or departing from such station by railroad.

If in the course of any proceedings which may be taken against any licensed person for infringing the provisions of this Act or the principal Act, relating to dosing, such person (in this section referred to as the defendant) fails to prove that the person to whom the intoxicating liquor was sold (in this section referred to as the purchaser) is a bona fide traveller, but the justices are satisfied that the defendant truly believed that the purchaser was a bon& fide traveller, and further that the defendant took all reasonable precautions to ascertain whether or not the purchaser was such a traveller, the justices shall dismiss the case as against the defendant, and if they think that the purchaser falsely represented himself to be a bona fide traveller, it shall be lawful for the justices to direct proceedings to be instituted against such purchaser under the twenty-fifth section of the principal Act.

A person for the purposes of this Act and the principal Act shall not be deemed to be a bona fide traveller unless the place where he lodged during the preceding night is at least three miles distant from the place where he demands to be supplied with liquor, such distance to be calculated by the nearest public thoroughfare.

11. Whereas by the Act of the session of the twenty-seventh Hours of and twenty-eighth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, closing night chapter sixty-four, it is provided that no persons within the houses* limits of that Act shall open or keep open any refreshment

house, to which that Act so far as it is unrepealed applies, or sell or expose for sale or consumption in any such refreshment house any refreshments or any article whatsoever between the hours of one and four o'clock in the morning: And whereas it is expedient to amend the provisions of the said Act: Be it therefore enacted, that the said Act, so far as it is unrepealed, shall be construed as if there were substituted therein for the hour of one o'clock in the morning the hour of the night or morning at which premises licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquors by retail situate in the same place as such refreshment house are required to be closed, and as if the whole of England were within the limits of the Act, and as if the expression "district" 'in the Act included any place in which such refreshment house is situate,

A declaration by the court that a record of an offence is to be made on a license shall be deemed to be part of the conviction or order of the court in reference to such offence, and shall be subject accordingly to the jurisdiction of the court of appeal.

A direction by the court that a conviction for an offence is to be recorded on the license of the offender shall, for the purposes of the principal Act, be deemed equivalent to a direction or requirement by the Act that such conviction is to be recorded; and all the provisions of the principal Act importing that convictions are required or directed by the Act to be recorded on the license of an offender shall be construed accordingly.

An Act to amend the Law relating to the payment of Revising Barristers.

[30th July 1874.]

BE it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritud. and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. Whereas doubts have arisen as to whether the provisions of the fifty-ninth section of the Parliamentary Electors Registration Act, 1843, with respect to the payment of barristers appointed to revise any list of voters in addition to the revising barristers originally appointed, apply to the payment of substitutes appointed in case of the death, illness, or absence of any revising barrister, or from any other cause, and it is expedient to remove such doubts, and to provide for the payment of such substitutes:

Be it therefore enacted that —

Where by reason of the death, illness, or absence of any barrister appointed to revise the lists of voters for any county, city, or borough, or from any other cause, a barrister is after the passing of this Act appointed to act in the place of the barrister so originally appointed, there shall be paid to him out of the sum which under section fifty-nine of the Parliamentory Electors Registration Act, 1843, would otherwise be payable to the barrister originally appointed, such sum for his remuneration and travelling expenses as to the Lord Chief Justice or judge who appointed him may seem reasonable.

Every barrister so originally appointed, in forwarding to the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury his appointment, and the statement of having completed his sittings, shall state whether any barrister has or has not been appointed as above mentioned to act in his place.

2. Terms in this Act have the same meaning as in the Revising Barristers Act, 1873.

3. This Act shall not extend to Scotland or Ireland.

4. This Act may be cited as the Revising Barristers Act, 1874. The Act of the session of the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter eighty-four, intituled An Act to amend the law relating to " the appointment of revising barristers," may be cited as the Revising Barristers Act, 1872.

This Act and the Revising Barristers1Act, 1872, and the Revising Barristers Act, 1873, may be cited together as the Revising Barristers Acts, 1872 to 1874.

5. The Acts specified in the schedule to this Act are hereby repealed from and after the passing of this Act to the

extent specified in the third column of that schedule, without schedule prejudice to anything done or suffered, before the passing of rePcaled. this Act under the enactments hereby repealed.

6. No barrister shall be appointed after the passing of this Qualification Act to revise any list of voters for any county, city, or of revising borough in England who is of less than seven years standing, r* unless he has been appointed in any year previous to the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three to be such revising barrister.

From and after the commencement of this Act the Poor Rate Acts shall extend to the following hereditaments in like manner as if they were mentioned in the recited Act of the forty-third year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth; that is to say,

(1.) To land used for a plantation or a wood or for the growth of saleable underwood, and not subject to any right of common;

(2.) To rights of fowling, of shooting, of taking or killing game or rabbits, and of fishing, when severed from the occupation of the land; and (3.) To mines of every kind not mentioned in the recited Act.

4. The gross and rateable value of any land used for a plantation or a wood, or for the growth of saleable underwood, shall be estimated as follows:—

(a.) If the land is used only for a plantation or a wood, the value shall be estimated as if the land instead of being a plantation or a wood were let and occupied in its natural and unimproved state:

(b.) If the land is used for the growth of saleable underwood, the value shall be estimated as if the land were let for that purpose:

(c.) If the land is used both for a plantation or a wood and for the growth of saleable underwood, the value shall be estimated either as if the land were used only for a plantation or a wood, or as if the land were used only for the growth of the saleable underwood growing thereon, as the assessment committee may determine.

5. Where the rateable value of any land used for a plantation or a wood, or both for a plantation or wood and for the growth of saleable underwood, is increased by reason of the same being estimated in accordance with this Act, the occupier of that land under any lease or agreement made before the commencement of this Act, may, during the continuance of the lease or agreement, deduct from his rent any poor or other local rate, or any portion thereof, which is paid by him in respect of such increase of rateable value, and every assessment committee, on the application of such occupier, shall

severed from the occupation of the land and is not

let, and the owner of such right receives rent for the land, the said right shall not be separately valued

or rated, but the gross and rateable value of the land

shall be estimated as if the said right were not

severed; and in such case if the rateable value is

increased by reason of its being so estimated, but

not otherwise, the occupier of the land may (unless he has specifically contracted to pay such rate in

the event of an increase) deduct from his rent such

portion of any poor or other local rate, as is paid by

him in respect of such increase; and every assessment

committee, on the application of the occupier, shall

certify in the valuation list or otherwise the fact

and amount of such increase.

(2.) Where any right of sporting, when severed from the occupation of the land, is let, either the owner or the lessee thereof, according as the persons making the rate determine, may be rated as the occupier thereof.

(3.) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section the owner of any right of sporting, when severed from the occupation of the land, may be rated as the occupier thereof.

(4.) For the purposes of this section, the person who, if the right of sporting is not let, is entitled to exercise the right, or who, if the right is let, is entitled to receive the rent for the same, shall be deemed to be the owner of the right

7. Where a tin, lead, or copper mine is occupied under a Gross and rate-lease or leases granted without fine on a reservation wholly or able vaJue of partly of dues or rent, the gross value of the mine shall be ^p^ines. taken to be the annual amount of the whole of the dues

payable in respect thereof during the year ending on the thirty-first day of December preceding the date at which the valuation list is made, in addition to the annual amount of any fixed rent reserved for the same which may not be paid or satisfied by such dues.

The rateable annual value of such mine shall be the same as the gross value thereof, except that where the person receiving the dues or rent is liable for repairs, insurance, or other expenses necessary to maintain the mine in a state to command the annual amount of dues or rent, the average annual cost of the repairs, insurance, and other expenses for which

In the following cases, namely, —

1. Where any such mine is occupied under a lease

granted wholly or partly on a fine; and

2. Where any such mine is occupied and worked by the

owner; and

3. In the case of any other such mine which is not excepted from the provisions of this Act and to which the foregoing provisions of this section do not apply; the gross and rateable annual value of the mine shall be taken to be the annual amount of the dues or dues and rdnt at which the mine might be reasonably expected to let without fine on a lease of the ordinary duration, according to the usage of the country, if the tenant undertook to pay all tenants rates and taxes and tithe rentcharge, and also the repairs, insurance, and other expenses necessary to maintain the mine in a state to command such annual amount of dues or dues and rent.

The purser, secretary, and chief managing agent for the time being of any tin, lead, or copper mine, or any of them, may, if the overseers or other rating authority think fit, be rated as the occupier thereof.

And whereas by an indenture dated the first day of June one thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine, and made between the Right Reverend William Lord Bishop of Derry and Raphoe of the one part, and the Very Reverend the Dean and Chapter of Derry of the other part, the said Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, under the powers of the said first-mentioned Act, granted the messuage and premises described in the first schedule annexed to this Act, being the then site of the said school, and being also the piece of land described in the Schedule B. to the said first-mentioned Act, upon trust for the use of the said school now known as and therein called and in this Act hereafter called Foyle College, at the yearly rent of sixteen pounds eight shillings and fourpence, and one shilling in the pound receiver's fees:

And whereas by an indenture bearing date the fourth day of November one thousand eight hundred and seventy, and made between the said William Percy Robinson of the one part, and the Society of the Governor and Assistants, London, of the New Plantation in Ulster within the realm of Ireland, commonly and in this Act hereafter called the Honourable the Irish Society, of the other part, the said William Percy Robinson did covenant and declare with and to the Honourable the Irish Society, that he, his heirs and assigns, would stand possessed of the said piece of land described in the second schedule annexed to this Act, subject to the said rent of fourteen pounds thirteen shillings and sevenpence, upon trust for the school called Foyle College, and to the intent that the same might be for ever thereafter held, used, occupied, and enjoyed with and as part of and for the purposes of the same school or college:

And whereas no orders, rules, or byelaws have ever been made for the regulation of the said school or college in pursuance of the said firstly herein-before recited Act of Parliament, nor have any trusts been ever declared thereof for any public, charitable, or other purpose, and the said school or college has been continuously carried on upon the pieces of land herein-before referred to and under the provisions of the same Act, but such school or college has not since that time been and is not of the nature of a free school or charity school, nor has any free education been given therein except by favour of the managers thereof for the time being, and not as of right:

And whereas by the Irish Church Act, 1869, every eccle- 32 & 33 Vict. siastical corporation in Ireland, whether sole or aggregate, and c'42, every cathedral corporation in Ireland, were dissolved on the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and doubts are entertained whether or not the persons who now hold offices similar to those held before the passing of the said Act by the Bishop of Derry and the Dean and Chapter of Derry have any power or authority in the management of Foyle College, or who has such power and authority:

And whereas in order to the good management of the said college it is expedient that a new body should be formed to undertake the management and control thereof, and it is expedient to vest all the property and effects of the said college in such new body:

And whereas doubts are entertained in whom the right so granted to the Bishop of Derry for the time being has become vested in consequence of the provisions of the said Irish Church Act, 1869, and it is expedient that such right shall be absolutely vested in the persons herein-after mentioned in that behalf:

And whereas the several purposes aforesaid cannot be effected without the authority of Parliament:

Be it enacted by the Queers most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

CHAPTER 86.

An Act to amend the Law relating to the Irish Reproductive Loan Fund.

[7th August 1874]

WHEREAS in the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two a large sum of money was subscribed in England for the purpose of relieving the distress arising from scarcity of food in Ireland, and the residue of such sum after affording relief in such distress, under the name of the " Irish u Reproductive Loan Fund," was vested in a charitable association called the " Irish Reproductive Loan Fund Institution," to be held by them on trust to lend the same at interest to the industrious poor in the ten counties of Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, and Tipperary, in Ireland, certain proportions of the said fund being appropriated to each of the said counties:

And whereas in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, by an Act of the session of the eleventh and twelfth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter one hundred and fifteen, intituled An Act to vest in Her Majesty the property of the Irish Reproductive Loan Fund " Institution, and to dissolve the said Institution," the said institution was dissolved, and the said Irish Reproductive Loan Fund was transferred to and vested in Her Majesty upon trust, to be applied and disposed of for such charitable purposes and objects of public utility not otherwise provided for in whole or in part by local rate or assessment (including the instruction in and the promotion of agricultural science) in the ten several counties aforesaid, as the Lord Lieutenant or other chief governor or governors of Ireland, with the assent of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, or any three or more of them, should from time to time direct and appoint, certain proportions being appropriated to each county as in the said Act mentioned:

And whereas it is expedient that the said Irish Reproductive Loan Fund should be transferred to the care of a public body in Ireland, and should be disposed of by way of loan instead of by way of absolute grant:

And whereas certain of the said counties, that is to say, the counties of Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, and Sligo, in this Act referred to as " maritime counties," abut upon the sea, and it is expedient that such portion of the said fund as is appropriated to the said maritime counties should be capable of being advanced by way of loan for the purpose of aiding the fisheries on the said coast:

And whereas the said Irish Reproductive Loan Fund, with the exception of certain outstanding debts which are not therein specified, consists at the date of the passing of this

3. The Commissioners for Public Works in Ireland, in this Power to re-Act referred to as the Commissioners, may enforce anycover property-remedies for the recovery of any portion of the said Irish Reproductive Loan Fund which Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, might have enforced if this Act had not passed,

and notwithstanding the passing of this Act it shall be lawful for Her Majesty to use, on behalf of the said Commissioners, any remedies for the recovery of the said fund or any part thereof which it would have been lawful for Her Majesty to have used if this Act had not passed.

4. The Commissioners shall hold the said Irish Reproductive Application of Loan Fund on trust to dispose of the same by way of loan m£sioners°m with a view to carry into effect the purposes of this Act.

Provided that where any charges to which that section refers have been defrayed out of any rate before the passing of this Act, the same, if not heretofore questioned in any court of law, shall be deemed to have been legally defrayed, so far as any objection could arise out of the proviso in this section referred to.

Provided further, that when any charges directed by the said sixteenth section of the principal Act to be paid in the case of a council of a borough out of the borough fund or borough rate have been hitherto divided between the landlord and tenant in moieties or otherwise, under the provisions of any Local Act in that behalf, the Local Government Board may, upon application, by their order, make provision for the continuance of such division of the charges between parties during the continuance of any contract existing at the passing of the Act.

9. If application be made to the Local Government Board, whereby it shall be alleged that it would be inequitable or inconvenient in the district of any urban sanitary authority that the expenses referred to in the said sixteenth section of the principal Act should be borne as therein provided, the said Board may, after inquiry by a provisional order, alter the

incidence of such charge in respect of the whole or some of the expenditure referred to, as to them shall appear to be fair and equitable.

Special expenses, as defined by section seventeen of the principal Act, shall include the expenses of the maintenance and cleansing of sewers and streets, of providing, repairing, and cleansing public wells, tanks, cisterns, and pumps, of lighting, where duly authorised, in any contributory place, and the charges or expenses arising out of or incidental to the possession of property transferred to the rural sanitary authority in trust for any parish, district, or contributory place.

11. Whereas the amount of charges for special expenses is sometimes so small in contributory places that no special rate could be conveniently assessed for the same: Where, therefore, the amount required in respect of special expenses in any one year is less than ten pounds, or is so small that a rate less than one penny in the pound would be required to raise the same, the overseers shall not assess and levy any special rate for the same, but shall pay the same out of the poor rate.

12. Where a sanitary authority is constituted a port sanitary authority for any port which contains more than one riparian authority, every riparian authority, other than the port authority itself, shall, if authorised by the order of the Local Government Board to do so, send to the meetings of the port sanitary authority, as representative or representatives of such riparian authority, some member or members of their own board, and such representative members shall be empowered to act as part of thef board of the port sanitary authority in respect of all matters entrusted to such authority.

The number of members to be assigned to each riparian authority shall be determined by the Local Government Board; and such Board may, by order, unite two or more riparian authorities for the election of one representative, and determine the mode of such election.

13. Where several riparian authorities are combined in the district of one port authority the Local Government Board may declare that some one or more of such authorities shall be exempt from contributing to the expenses incurred by such authorities.

14. The Local Government Board may combine the sanitary authorities of several ports into one body to form a port sanitary authority for a district, and assign to such authority a title, and otherwise proceed as in the case of a port sanitary authority provided for by the twentieth section of the principal Act.

And such combination shall be a united district, to which all the provisions of the said Act which relate to such a

20. When the Local Government Board shall have at any time made any order under the forty-ninth section of the Sanitary Act, 1860, limiting the time for the performance by any authority of its duty, such order may be enforced by writ of mandamus, notwithstanding the provision in the said

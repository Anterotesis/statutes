Bank of Ireland Charter Amendment. 35 Tier.

CHAPTER 5.

An Act to amend the Charter under which the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland is incorporated.

[23d April 1872.]

WHEREAS by charter or letters patent under the Great Seal of Ireland, bearing date the tenth day of May one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, in the twenty-third year of the reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, and granted in pursuance of an Act passed in the twenty-first and twenty-second year of the reign of his said Majesty, the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland were duly incorporated:

And whereas for the better ordering, managing, and governing the stock and affairs of the said Corporation, and for the making and establishing a continual succession of persons to be governor, deputy governor, and directors of the said Corporation, it was thereby ordained and appointed that there should be, from time to time, for ever, of the members of the said company, a governor, a deputy governor, and fifteen directors of and in the said Corporation; which governor, deputy governor, and directors, or any eight or more of them, of whom the governor or deputy governor, unless as thereinafter was excepted, should be always one, should be and be called a court of directors for the ordering, managing, and directing the affairs of the said Corporation, and should have such powers and privileges as were therein-after mentioned: And whereas it was thereby provided and directed that at no annual election there should be chosen for directors for the ensuing year above two thirds of those who were directors for the year next preceding:

And whereas it was thereby further provided and directed that all succeeding governors, deputy governors, and directors of the said Corporation should, from and after the twenty-fifth day of March in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four, be yearly and successively chosen for ever out of the members of the said Corporation, on some day or days or times between the twenty-fifth day of March and twenty-fifth day of April in every year, by the majority of votes of all and every of the members of the said Corporation having the qualification therein mentioned, and who should be personally present at such elections; which succeeding governors, deputy governors, and directors so chosen should severally and respectively continue in their respective offices for one year, and until others should be duly chosen and sworn into their places respectively as therein directed:

And whereas it is expedient that the members of the said Corporation, duly qualified as in the said charter mentioned,

1872. Bank of Ireland Charter' Amendment Ch. 5. 125

and present at a general court of the said Corporation duly convened in manner provided by the said charter, should have power to reduce the number of the directors of the said Corporation from fifteen to thirteen or to eleven, as they may deem expedient, exclusive of the governor and deputy governor:

And whereas it is also expedient that at every annual election all or any of those who were directors for the year next preceding should be eligible to be re-elected:

And whereas, in consequence of reducing the number of directors, it'will be necessary to alter the provisions contained in the said charter in respect of the number necessary to form a quorum of a court of directors, and to enable the members of the said Corporation to make their byelaws to conform with the provisions contained in this Act:

Where any subsidiary company or company alleged to be subsidiary is not in process of being wound up at the same time as the principal company to which it is subsidiary, the court shall not direct such subsidiary company to be wound up unless after hearing all objections (if any) that may be urged by or on behalf of such company against its being wound up, the court is of opinion that such company is subsidiary to the principal company, and that the winding up of such company in conjunction with the principal company is just and equitable.

Where any subsidiary company and principal company are being wound up by different branches of the court, the court to which appeals from such branches lie shall make an order directing in which branch the winding up of such companies is to be carried on, and the necessary proceedings shall be taken for carrying such order into effect

1872. Life Assurance Companies Acts Amendment. Ch. 41. 257

An application may be made in relation to the winding up of any subsidiary company in conjunction with a principal company by any creditor of, or person interested in, such principal or subsidiary company.

5. Where a life assurance company is being wound up by Valuation of the court, or subject to the supervision of the court, or volun- an"njties tarily, the value of every life annuity and life policy requiring cies *

to be valued in such winding up shall be estimated in manner provided by the First Schedule to this Act, but this section shall not apply to any company the winding up of which has commenced before the passing of this Act, unless the court having cognizance of the winding up so order, which order that court is hereby empowered to make, if it think it expedient so to do, on the application of any person interested in the winding up of such company.

6. The rules in the First and Second Schedules to this Act Rules in First

shall be of the same force as if they were rules made in pur- be

suance of the one hundred and seventieth, one hundred and raies 0" court, seventy-first, and one hundred and seventy-third sections of

" The Companies Act, 1862," as the case may be, and may be altered in manner provided by the said sections, and rules may be made under the said sections for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Act with respect to the winding up of companies.

7. Where a company, either before or after the passing of Regulation as this Act, has transferred its business to or been amalgamated

with another company, no policy holder in the first-mentioned p°1C* ° el* company who shall pay to the other company the premiums accruing due in respect of his policy shall by reason of any such payment made after the passing of this Act, or by reason of any other act done after the passing of this Act, be deemed to have abandoned any claim which he would have had against the first-mentioned company on due payment of premiums to such company, or to have accepted in lieu thereof the liability of the other company, unless such abandonment and acceptance have been signified by some writing signed by him or by his agent lawfully authorised.

Rule for valuing cm Annuity.

Rule for valuing a Policy.

The value of the policy is to be the difference between the present value of the reversion in the sum assured on the decease of the life, including any bonus or addition thereto made before the commencement of the winding up and the present value of the future annual premiums.

In calculating such present values the rate of interest is to be assumed as being four per centum per annum, and the rate of mortality as that of the tables known as the seventeen offices experience tables.

The premium to be calculated is to be such premium as according to the said rate of interest and rate of mortality is sufficient to provide for the risk incurred by the office in issuing the policy, exclusive of any addition thereto for office expenses and other charges.

SECOND SCHEDULE.

Where an assurance company is being wound up by the court or subject to the supervision of the court, the official liquidator in the case of all persons appearing by the books of the company to be entitled to or interested in policies granted by such company, for life assurance, endowment, annuity, or other payment, is to ascertain the value of such policies, and give notice of such value to such persons, and any person to whom notice is so given shall be bound by the value so ascertained unless he gives notice of his intention to dispute such value in manner and within a time to be prescribed by a rule or order of the courts

Act, be transferred to the office of the Paymaster General for Chancery business, and shall hold their offices under the Treasury upon the like terms and conditions as to rank, promotion, tenure, salaries, and pensions (if any), as at the commencement of this Act they held the same under the Accountant General or the Lord Chancellor, but subject to the directions of the Treasury they shall be under the control of the Paymaster General in like manner as other clerks and officers in the office of the Paymaster General, and shall perform such duties in relation to any business in that office as the Treasury may from time to time direct.

24.

tions in any books kept by them as may be directed by the Treasury for the purpose of substituting the aeoount of the Paymaster General for the time being on behalf of the Court of Chancery for the name of the Accountant General of the Court of Chancery. Such of the books containing the accounts of the suitors of the Court of Chancery, which in pursuance of any Act of Parliament have been kept in the Chancery Office at the Bank of England, as the Treasury may from time to time require, shall be delivered to such person in such manner and under such regulations and upon such terms as may be agreed on between the Treasury and the Governor and Company of the Bank of England.

25. Whereas under the provisions of the Acts specified in Schedule One to this Act certain sums awarded for compensation for slaves upon the abolition of slavery, which were subject to claims or proceedings before the courts of judicature in the colonies, or before any court or courts of judicature or of appeal in the United Kingdom, were paid over to the Accountant General of the Court of Chancery and invested by him in three per cent, consolidated Bank annuities, or were transferred into the name of the Accountant General in equivalent amounts of three pounds ten shillings per cent, reduced Bank annuities, but all dividends on the said Bank annuities have since the passing of the Act of the session of the fourth and fifth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter eighteen, ceased to be applied to augment the capital of the said annuities, and have been from time to time by warrant from the Treasury paid over to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt.

And whereas certain of the said sums of Bank annuities have not been dealt with for many years, and are still standing in the name of the Accountant General of the Court of Chancery, but are subject to any claims made in pursuance of any decree, order, or judgment of the court in which such proceedings are pending: Be it therefore enacted, that as soon as may be after the commencement of this Act the Treasury shall issue their warrant to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, requiring them to transfer to the account of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt all sums of Bank annuities and cash which may be standing in the name of the said Accountant General to the credit of any account in pursuance of the Acts mentioned in Schedule One to this Act, and all dividends which may then be due on any such Bank annuities, and the Governor and Company of the Bank of England shall make the transfer so required, and thereupon such sums of Bank annuities shall be cancelled by some officer of the said Governor and Company, and the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt shall apply all cash transferred to them in pursuance

of this section in reduction of the National Debt in the same manner as if such cash were a surplus of the annual revenue.

The Consolidated Fund shall, to the same extent as the Bank annuities so transferred, be liable to make good all sums required to meet the claims on such annuities under an}-decree, order, or judgment of any court, and the Treasury shall from time to time cause to be issued to the Paymaster General out of the growing produce of the Consolidated Fund such sums as may be required for the purposes of this section, but not to any greater amount than the value of the Bank annuities at the date of such issue, ascertained as directed by a rule under this Act made with respect to securities transferred to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt; and every court may make the like order with respect to such Bank annuities as it might have done if this Act had not passed.

It is understood that the above-mentioned liberty applies solely to the sea fishery, and that the salmon and shad fisheries, and all other fisheries in rivers and the mouths of rivers, are hereby reserved exclusively for British fishermen.

Article XIX.

In case any question should arise between the Governments of Her Britannic Majesty and of the United States as to the common right of fishing in places not thus designated as reserved, it is agreed that a Commission shall be appointed to designate such places, and shall be constituted in the same manner, and have the same powers, duties, and authority as the Commission appointed under the said first Article of the Treaty of the 5th of June 1854.

If in the case submitted to the Commissioners either Party shall have specified or alluded to any report or document in its own exclusive possession, without annexing a copy, such Party shall be bound, if the other Party thinks proper to apply for it, to furnish that Party with a copy thereof; and either Party may call upon the other, through the Commissioners, to produce the originals or certified copies of any papers adduced as evidence, giving in each instance such reasonable notice as the Commissioners may require.

The case on either side shall be closed within a period of six months from the date of the organization of the Commission, and the Commissioners shall be requested to give their award as soon as possible thereafter.

Such assent having been given, the said Articles shall remain in force for the period of ten years from the date at which they may come into operation, and farther, until the expiration of two years after either of the High Contracting Parties shall have given notice to the other of its wish to terminate the same; each of the High Contracting Parties being at liberty to give such notice to the other at the end of the said period of ten years or at any time afterward.

Where a contribution for general expenses is required from a contributory place or part of a contributory place which is part of a parish, the overseers shall from time to time levy such increase of rate from the contributory place or such part thereof as may be sufficient to recoup the parish for the sum it has paid on account of the contributory place or such part thereof in respect of general expenses under this Act, and carry the same to the general account of the parish, and such increase of rate shall be raised in such contributory place or

ert of a contributory place by an addition to the poor rate, or a separate rate to be assessed, made, allowed, published, collected, and levied in the same manner as a poor rate.

For the purpose of obtaining payment from the contributory riparian sanitary authorities of the sums to be contributed by them, such port sanitary authority shall issue its precept to each such authority requiring it, within a time limited by the precept, to pay the amount therein mentioned to such port sanitary authority, or to such person as such port sanitary authority may direct.

Any contribution payable by a riparian sanitary authority to such port sanitary authority shall be a debt due from it, and may be recovered accordingly, such contribution in the* case of a rural sanitary authority being deemed general expenses of that authority. If any riparian sanitary authority

CHAPTER 80.

An Act to enable the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to pay into the High Court of Chancery in England certain moneys being the amount paid to the Paymaster General on account of Her Majesty's Treasury in respect of the non-completion of the railway authorised by " The Kensington Station and North and South London Junction Railway Act, 1859." [10th August 1872.]

WHEREAS by " The Kensington Station and North and South London Junction Railway Act, 1859," hereinafter called the recited Act, the Kensington Station and North and South London Junction Railway Company, herein-after called " the company," was incorporated, with powers to make and maintain a railway from near Lillie Bridge in the parish of Saint Mary Abbott s, Kensington, to a point in the same parish on the west side of Love Lane, the object being by connecting the said railway with the then proposed extension of the West London Railway, to facilitate communication between divers railways south of the Thames and the western districts of the metropolis, and for other purposes:

And whereas pursuant to the standing orders of both Houses of Parliament and to an Act of the session of the ninth and tenth years of Her present Majesty, chapter twenty, a sum of five thousand seven hundred and sixty pounds, being eight pounds per centum on the estimate of the expense of the railway authorised by the recited Act, was deposited with the Court of Chancery in England in respect of the application to Parliament for the Act:

And whereas in pursuance of the twenty-fifth section of the recited Act that sum of five thousand seven hundred and sixty pounds was released upon a bond being executed to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, by the company and by Samuel Gurney, then of Prince's Gate, in the county of Middlesex, a member of the firm of Overend, Gurney, and Company, and who in this acted as surety for the Company in the penal sum of eleven thousand five hundred and twenty pounds, conditioned to be void if the railway was opened for the conveyance of passengers within the time limited by the

579

1872. Kensington Station, Sc, {Repayment of Mon&ys). Ch. 80.

recited Act, or if it should be proved to the satisfaction of the Lords of the Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council for Trade and Foreign Plantations that the company had paid up and expended for the purposes of their Act one half of the amount of their authorised share capital, or if the company should pay to Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, the full sum of five thousand seven hundred and sixty pounds.

And whereas no steps were taken to construct the railway mentioned in the recited Act, and the objects sought to be accomplished have, by the projection and subsequent sanction by Parliament of the Metropolitan District Railway, which has been constructed and is now open for public traffic, been more completely effected:

And whereas the powers granted by the recited Act expired on the thirteenth day of August one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two:

And whereas the bond to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, so executed by the company and the said Samuel Gurney, was on the third day of July one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one registered by the officers of the Crown at the Common Pleas, and thus constituted an obligation affecting his estates:

And whereas on or about the thirty-first day of July in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five the firm of Overend, Gurney, and Company sold and transferred their business to a firm or company under the name or style of Overend, Gurney, and Company (Limited), herein-after called the limited company

And whereas on or about the tenth day of May in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six the limited company stopped payment, and William Turquand, of Tokenhouse Yard, and Robert Palmer Harding, of the Old Jewry, in the city of London, public accountants, were appointed liquidators to wind up the affairs of that company:

And whereas on or about the fifteenth day of August one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six the said William Turquand and Robert Palmer Harding were also appointed inspectors to superintend the realisation and winding up of the affairs of the members of the said firm of Overend, Gurney, and Company (of whom the said Samuel Gurney was one), the limited company being the principal creditors of the ' firm of Overend, Gurney, and Company:

And whereas in the years one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six and one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven the said William Turquand and Robert Palmer Harding gave instructions for the sale (among other properties) of various estates belonging to the said Samuel Gurney, and, owing to the disastrous circumstances attending the failure of the limited company and the necessity that existed of raising as speedily as possible large sums of money to meet the demands of the

3 C 2

580

Ch. 80. Kensington Station, <tc. (Repayment). 35 & 36 Vict.

liquidation, it was matter of imperative necessity that those estates should be sold and the sales carried out with the greatest practicable expedition:

And whereas upon the sale in lots of portions of the estates of the said Samuel Gurney the purchasers refused to complete their purchases and pay their purchase moneys until the properties purchased by them had respectively been discharged from all liability in respect of the bond to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, registered at the Common Pleas as aforesaid:

And whereas upon the application of the said William Turquand and Robert Palmer Harding to the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury certificates of exoneration were from time to time granted, relieving the properties so sold from liability in respect of the said bond, but when the sales of the last of the properties belonging to the said Samuel Gurney had to be completed, the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, in reply to a memorial presented on his behalf praying that his estates might be released from liability in respect of the said bond, replied that they were advised they had no power to remit the penalties or conditions prescribed by the recited Act:

And whereas it being of the utmost importance that the assets of the estate of the said Samuel Gurney should be realised and distributed as rapidly as possible, the said William Turquand and Robert Palmer Harding thereupon paid, on the third day of April one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, to the Paymaster General on account of Her Majesty's Treasury the said sum of five thousand seven hundred and sixty pounds, and by consent of Her Majesty's Attorney General and by order of the Court of Queen's Bench satisfaction was thereupon entered at the Common Pleas in respect of the said bond:

And whereas the assets of the said Samuel Gurney have proved utterly inadequate to meet the claims on his estate, and the said William Turquand and Robert Palmer Harding are now bringing to a close their liquidation and inspectorship: And whereas under the provisions of "The Abandonment of Railways Act, 1850, "and "The Railways Companies Act, 1867," the Board of Trade was authorised, upon application made in the manner therein prescribed, and under circumstances analogous to those affecting the railway authorised by the recited Act, to grant warrants or certificates for the abandonment of railways, and upon any such warrant or certificate the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury may cancel and deliver up any bond entered into or on behalf of the railway company obtaining such warrant or certificate: And whereas numerous applications have been made to the Board of Trade under those Acts, and bonds cancelled under the provisions and in accordance with the conditions of w The

1872. Kemvngton Station, <bc. {Repayment of Moneys). Ch. 80. 581

Railway Companies Act, 1867," and " The Abandonment of Railways Act, 1869

And whereas in the whole circumstances before recited it is expedient that relief should be granted for the benefit of the estate and creditors of the said Samuel Gurney by the repayment to the said William Turquand and Robert Palmer Harding of the aforesaid sum of fwe thousand seven hundred and sixty pounds:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L This Act may for all purposes be cited as " The Ken- Short title, sington Station and North and South London Junction Railway Act, 1859 (Repayment of Moneys) Act, 1872 "

On such warrant being granted the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury for the time being may, out of moneys to be provided by Parliament for the purpose, pay into the High Court of Chancery in England the said sum of five thousand seven hundred and sixty pounds, which sum by reason of the non-completion of the said railway was paid to the Paymaster General on account

(3.) It shall not be lawful for the Commissioners nor for the persons liable to tithe rentcharge to take any proceedings under section thirty-two of the Act of the session of the first and second years of Her present Majesty chapter one hundred and nine, to vary the rentcharges with reference to the average price of corn, and the said section is, and all other provisions for such variation are hereby repealed so far as relates to all tithe rentcharge vested in the Commissioners: Provided, however, that in any case where proceedings shall for such purpose have been commenced before the passing of this Act, the same shall not be affected by this provision, and may be continued, and such order as may be made thereon shall be valid in all respects as if this Act had not been passed.

(4.)

The annual sum charged by such order shall have priority over all charges and incumbrances, except quit or crown rents, and shall be payable by the same persons, and be recoverable in the same manner, and be subject to the same charges, if any, as the rentcharge in lieu of tithes heretofore payable out of the same lands.

" Owner " for the purposes of this and the next preceding section shall mean the person for the time being liable to pay rentcharge in lieu of tithes under the provisions of the Act of the first and second years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter one hundred and nine.

The provisions of this section shall be deemed to be and shall be in substitution of the provisions of section thirty-two of the principal Ant, and, where the Commissioners have, under the provisions of the said section thirty-two, made any sale to any owner, they may make such allowance to such owner or to his legal representatives as will place such owner or such representative in a position similar to that in which he would have been placed had the provisions of this section

8. The Commissioners may, when purchasing the surrender or assignment of any subsisting lease of rentcharge in lieu of tithes made by an ecclesiastical person or corporation, where such lease has, previous to the passing of the principal Act, been renewable by custom, treat the same as a renewable lease for the purpose of estimating the value and fixing the purchase money thereof

9.

A license under the Wine and Beerhouse Acts, 1869 and 1870, shall not be granted in respect of any premises which are not, in the opinion of the licensing justices who grant such license, of such annual value as is mentioned in that behalf in the Acts recited by the Wine and Beerhouse Act, 186 9; and those Acts shall be construed as if "annual value " were therein substituted for " rent," " value," " rated on a rent or annual value," and other like expressions.

If at the first general annual licensing meeting after the passing of this Act the licensing justices are of opinion that any premises which are licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquors at the passing of this Act are not of such annual value as authorises the grant of a license for such premises, they may, notwithstanding, renew such license upon the condition, to be expressed in the license, that the holder thereof, before the next general annual licensing meeting, improves the premises so as to make them of sufficient annual value, and if the holder fail to comply with such condition the license shall not be renewed at such next general annual licensing meeting.

(2.) A renewal of a license may be made by an endorsement on the license, or by the issue of a copy of the old license, but in the latter case there shall be endorsed on such copy all convictions made within the previous five years which are endorsed on the old license.

The Commissioners of Inland Revenue may alter the form of any license granted by them for the sale of intoxicating liquors, in such manner as they may think expedient, for the purposes of bringing such form into conformity with the law for the time being in force.

40. Where on the occasion of an application for a new license or transfer or renewal of a license which authorises the sale of any intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises, the applicant, at the time of his application, applies to the licensing justices to insert in his license a condition that he shall keep the premises in respect of which such license is or is to be granted closed during the whole of Sunday, the justices shall insert the said condition in such license.

The holder of a license in which such condition is inserted (in this Act referred to as a six-day license) shall keep his premises closed during the whole of Sunday, and the provisions of this Act with respect to the closing of licensed premises during certain hours on Sunday shall apply to* the premises in respect of which a six-day license is granted as if the whole of Sunday were mentioned in those provisions instead of certain hours only. The holder of a six-day license .may obtain from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue any license granted by such commissioners, which he is entitled to obtain in pursuance of such six-day license, upon payment of six seventh parts of the duty which would otherwise be payable by him for a similar license not limited to six days; and if he sell any intoxicating liquor on Sunday he shall be deemed to be selling intoxicating liquor without a license.

The notice which a licensed person is required to keep painted or fixed on his premises shall, in the case of a license under this section, contain words indicating that such license is for six days only.

A copy of the notice shall be personally served upon or sent by registered letter to the owner of the premises from which the license is to be removed, and the holder of the license, unless he is also the applicant.

The justices to whom the application is made shall not make an order sanctioning such removal unless they are satisfied that no objection to such removal is made by the owner of the premises to which the license is attached, or by the holder of the license or by any other person whom such justices shall determine to have a right to object to the removal.

Subject as aforesaid, such justices shall have the same power to make an order sanctioning such removal as they have to grant new licenses; but no such order shall be valid unless confirmed by the confirming authority of the licensing district.

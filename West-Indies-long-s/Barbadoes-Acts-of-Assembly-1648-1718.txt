Preamble. *0 RAS MUCH as great Care hath been had, for divers Years pad, for £7 the quieting, settling, and ascertaining all Mens Rights and Possessions in and to their Lands and Tenements within this Island, so as that the Difficulty and determining Mens Interests through the Defeats of former Grants, or the Weakness of Men in the Infancy of Settlements, as to Deeds and due Forms of Law, hath been of late Years reasonably well evinced and cleared, and the Limitation of Time, as to Mens Rights and Estates, Claims and Properties, hath been successively enlarged and continued beyond Expectation, whereby all Capacities and Conditions of Persons might arrive to a Challenge of any their Effates; and that it is high time now the Possessors of Lands should, in some measure, be free from the daily Vexation of unwarranted Claims, Entries, and secret Possessions, gained by litigious, troublesome, and unconcerned Persons, who, notwithstanding the Courts of Common Pleas are open, and do hold monthly, for the determining Mens Rights, yet do daily vex and disturb the Inhabitants of this Island in their Possessions and Estates, by privately setting up petty Roofs, or thatcht Houses, fonie-times in the Night, sometimes in the Day, in the remote Bounds or Parts of their Plantations and Lands, and by sudden and secret Entries into Lands and Tenements, or by private Ways of gaining Possession upon very frivolous Sug-geftions, do pretend Right and Property j and by such Means, with other subtil Tricks and Pretensions, meeting many times with the Advantage of ignorant Persons concurrent with their Devices, do daily trouble and put to charge the Owners and rightful Possessors, and indanger their just Interests, when in truth the Party so indirectly gaining Possession or Entring, hath no just Cause lor his so doing : And also whereas it often falls out, that upon due Tryal at the Common Law, it was found that such Entry was altogether unlawful, whereupon Judgment is given, that the Plaintiff shall recover his Possession, with Costs and Damages against the Defendant, whole Condition is for the most part so desperate, that he is not able to perform the Sentence of the Law, whereby the Plaintiff, after a tedious Suit, and his Estate wasted, is left reme-dilefs, to his intolerable Grief and Damage : For Prevention of which great ciaufei. Rvils for the future. It is ordained and enacted by the Deputy Governor, the Council, and Assembly of Representatives of this Island of Barbadoes, and by Authority of the same, That henceforward no Person or Persons whatsoever EmuSeable presume to make any forceable Entries, or forceable Detainers, into, or of any Lands, Houses, or Tenements within this Island, or presume to enter secretly into any Man’s Lands, Houses, or Tenements, so? gaining of Possession, by Nottoerea setting up any Roofs, Huts, Hovels, Tents, or thatcht Houses, or by any ?mditHouse«/uch private or secret Practices, or other Ways or Means whatsoever, without to gain poiref-due Course, Tryal, and Recovery at Lawfirft had and obtained, under Pe-Forfciture. nalty of forfeiting Ten thousand Pounds of Sugar for every Person so offend-

Preamble. T I WHEREAS at this time there is a very great Abatement in the Value VV of Land, Sugar, Cotton, Ginger, and all other Wares, and Commodities of the Growth of this Island, both here, and also in England', and other foreign Parts, whither they are transported : And whereas divers Inhabitants of this Place, as well Planters as Merchants, Farmers of plantations, and Tradesmen, both for their urgent and necessary Occasions, for the following their Trades, and Maintenance of their Stocks and Employments, have borrowed, and do borrow divers Sums of Money, Sugar, Wares, Merchandizes, and other Commodities - but by reason of the said general Fall and Abatement of the Value of Lands, and the Prices of Sugar, and other Merchandize, Wares, and Commodities aforesaid, and Interest in Loan, continuing at so high a Rate as Fifteen Pounds in the Hundred for One Year, doth not only make Men unable to pay their Debts, and continue the Maintenance of Trade, but their Debts daily increasing, they are inforced to fell their Lands and Stock at very low Rates, to forsake the Use of Merchandize and Trade, and to give over their Leases and Farms, and so become unprofitable Members of the Commonwealth, to the great Hurt and Hindrance clause I. of the fame : Be it therefore ordained and enacted, and it is hereby ordained and enacted by the Deputy Governor, Council, and Assembly, and by Authority of the same, That no Person or Persons whatsoever, from and after the Nine and twentieth Day of September next, upon any Contract to be made after the said Nine and twentieth Day of September, shall take di-redtly or indirectly for Loan of any Monies, Sugars, or other Wares, Mer-joi. per cent, chandizes, or Commodities whatsoever, above the Value of Ten Pounds for interest. the Forbearance of One hundred Pounds for a Year, and so after that Rate for a greater or lesser Sum, or for a longer or fhoiter Time. And that all Contrafts for Bonds, Contradts, and Alfurances whatsoever, made after the time aforesaid, cSIVoid!P" for Payment of any Principal or Money to be lent, or covenanted to be performed upon or for any Usury, whereupon or whereby there shall be reserved or taken above the Rate of Ten in the Hundred, as aforesaid, shall be utterly void. And that all and every Person and Persons whatsoever, which shall, after the time aforesaid, upon any Contract to be made after the said Nine and twentieth Day of September, take, accept, and receive, by way or means of any corrupt Bargain, Loan, Exchange, Chievefance, Shift, or Interest of any Wares, Merchandizes, or other Tiling or Things whatsoever, or by any deceitful Way or Means, or by any Covin, Engine, or deceitful Conveyance, for the forbearing or giving Day of Payment for one whole Year, of and for their Monies or other Things, above the Sum of Ten Pounds for the Forbearance of one hundred Pounds for a Year, and so after that Forfeiture. Rate for a lefTer or greater Sum, or for a longer or shorter Time, lhalf forfeit and lose for every such Offence, treble the Value of the Monies, Sugars, Wares, Merchandizes, and other things so lent, bargained, exchanged, or shifted.

And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every CIaufs 1!-Scrivener and Scriveners, Broker and Brokers, Solicitor and Solicitors, Driver and Drivers of Bargains or Contradis, who shall, after the said Nine and twentieth Day of September, fake or receive directly or indirectly any Sum or Sums of Money, or other Reward or Things for Brokage, Soliciting, Driving, or Procuring the Loan, or forbearing of any Sum or Sums of Money, cvet; or above the Rate or Value of Five Shillings for the Loan, or forbearing of Procur e 5 r. One hundred Pounds Sterling for a Year, and lo rateably j or above Twelve J'J^che Pence for making or receiving of the Bond or Bill for the Loan or Forbear-Bond-ance thereof, or for any Counterbond or Bill concerning the fame,7 shall forfeit Forfeiture, for every such Offence Two thousand Pounds of Mufco-vadoe Sugar, and have Imprisonment for half a Year the one Moiety of which Forfeitures to be to the King our Sovereign Lord, His Heirs, and Successors, and the other Moiety to him or them that will sue for theTame, in the fame Precincts where the several Offences a.re committed, and not el few here, by Action of Debt, Bill,

Plaint, or Information, in which no Essoign, Wager of Law, or Protection to be allowed.

And to the end 'there may be no fhifring Eyafions in Abuse to the true Intent and Meaning of this Act, as there hath been of the former Act of this Island, by changing the Species of the Debt, sometimes from Money into Sugar and other Commodities, and again at other times from Sugar and other Commodities into Money; wherein the Lender or Creditor working on the Necelfity of the Debtor or Borrower, hath set so low a Value on Sugar* when he converteth his Money into Sugar, and on the contrary so high a'

Value on it, when his Sugar Debt or Sugar were to be converted into Money, that by such Shifting, the original Sum lent, hath generally in Two or Three Years at mod been doubled, to the great OpprefTion of the Inhabitants of this Island, and the Scandal of Justice, that have not adjudged such Shifting and indirect Gourfes to be contrary to the former Act; It is hereby acted and ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That there shall be no Change Money inL 3 or Alteration of Money or Wares lent or continued in the Hands of any Bor- 8^0Js’into rower; but that whatsoever is lent or continued shall Hill remain M°iey-unchanged flom the Species it was fTrfh lent in, and that no Commodities be, as aforesaid, changed or Ihifted into Money, nor Money into Commodities.

And forasmuch as in the Understanding of one Clause of the Act, efta-Preamble, blishing the Courts of Common Pleas within this Island, the Judges of the respective Courts have differed in Opinion and Practice, whereby some In-conveniencies have happened, as well to the Merchant and Trader, as Inhabitants of this Island, by reason that on Recoveries in this Island of Debt payable in England, and there not duly satisfied, some Judges have ordered the Satisfying thereof by Appraisement, some by Sab or Outcry* when as indeed neither of those Courses are directed by the said Act, but done at the Discretion of the Judges : To the end there may be no Failure of Justice, and that every Recovery should be fatjsfied, for Prevention of which different Proceedings, and for the establishing a just and equal Way for the satisfying such Debts and Recoveries, It is hereby enacted and ordained, and the respective Chafe tv. Judges of this Island are hereby required, upon all such Recoveries now or nereafter to be made by reason of any Contract preceding the Publication this Act, be satisfied and paid by Attachment arid Appraisement, and that no ‘ II7’

Sale by Outcry in such Cafe be allowed : And whatever Recoveries shall hereafter be obtained in any of the Courts cf this Island, of Money that were payable in England, and became due by reason of any Contract made -after the Publication of this Act, such Money Debts shall be here satisfied by Mufcova-doe Sugar, at Two Pence the Pound; or whatever else shall be attached, where no Mufco'vadoe Sugar can be found, shall be appraised into Muscovadoe Sugar j

56 The LAWS*bf BARBADOES.

and if the Recovery be on Bills of Exchange, Twenty per Cent, to be added, as by the former Law of this Island is appointed. And in ordering and appointing Appraisers, the Judges are to have an especial Care, that they appoint none to appraise, but such as are good and sufficien'c Freeholders. This Act to continue for the Space of Seven Years from the said Nine and twentieth Day of September, and so to the End of the Setting of the Assembly then next following.

An Act for preventing the Selling of Brandy and Rum in Tip-ling Houses near the broad Paths and Highways within this Island.

FORASMUCH as intolerable Hurts and Troubles to this Island do continually grow and increase through the Multiplicity of such Abuses and Disorders as are daily had and used in unlicens’d Tipling Houses, commonly called Brandy or Rum Houses, which are for the most part situated and erected near to broad Paths or Highways, whereby the Keepers rof such Houses take Advantage to trade and deal with Servants and Negroes for stolen Goods, contrary to Law, and to the great Oppression and Damage of honest and indu-ftrious People. And whereas on Sabbath Days many lewd, loose, and idle People, do usually resort to such Tipling Houses, who, by their Drunkenness, Swearing, and other Miscarriages, do, in a very high Nature, blaspheme the Name of God, prophane the Sabbath, and bring a great Scandal upon true Christian Religion : For Prevention whereof for the future. Be it ordained, and enacted by the Deputy Governor, Council, and Assessibly, and by Authority of the same, and it is hereby ordained and enacted, That no Person or Persons whatsoever be permitted or licensed to fell Wine, Brandy, or Rum, or any other strong Liquors in such Tipling Houses, as aforesaid, from and after the first Day of June next ensuing the Date hereof, upon any Pretence whatsoever.

And in case any Person shall, contrary to this Act, obstinately presume to fell such Liquors in such Tipling Houses, as aforesaid, then the Person or Persons so convicted by the Oath ot two or more credible Witnesses, or by the Par-ty’s own Confession, shall, for such their first Offence, forfeit and pay the thefifftof- Sum of five hundred Pounds of Sugar; the fame to be levied by Distress, as fence, jn cafg0f Servants Wages, by Warrant from any Justice of the Peace of that Parish where such Offence shall be committed: The fame Forfeitures to be converted to, and reserved for the Use and Maintenance of the Poor of that re-secondcommit- spe<^*ve Parish. And in case any Person shall offend the second time in the ted to Gaol., fame Nature, that then the Person or Persons so offending, for such his second Offence,be committed to the common Gaol of this Island, there to remain without Bail or Mainprize for the Space of Three Months; and fb for every such Offence so committed after his or their first Conviction j any Law, Usage, or Custom heretofore to the contrary notwithstanding. to&ape£t!nd Provided always, and it is the true Intent and Meaning of this Act, Towns, That no-Persons dwelling in any the Sea Port Towns or Bays within this island,

war'd 0^0^., and have Licence for the felling Wine, Beer, and other strong Liquors, shall. be by this Act debarred to sell the same, except such as live windward o(0ifinis, and to leeward of Six Mens Bay.

Neither shall be construed to extend to the Prohibition of such Person or Persons as are appointed to give Entertainment in their Houses .at the Quarter Sessions, or other Court or Courts of Judicature within the Body of this Island.

Forasmuch as the extravagant Wandring of several Persons with their Packs of Wares in and about this Island from House to House, there to make Sale of the fame, hath been found to be very prejudicial to the Inhabitants thereof, not only for that such Toleration is contrary to the whol-some Laws of England, which strictly prohibit all such Pedlars as Vagabonds, but for that it doth also occasion and create many great Mischiefs to this Place, by reason of the continual under-hand Dealing of such Perl'ons every where with Servants and Negroes; whereby they drive on most part of their Trade by trucking for stolen Goods, to no small Damage of honest and industrious Planters, who may, from time to time, supply himself with all forts of Commodities at cheaper Rates from the Merchant, at the several Towns and Store-houses within this Island : Be it therefore ordained and enabled by the Deputy Governor, Council, and Assembly, and Authority of the same, That all such Persons, as shall presume so to travel, wander, or go from House to House in this Island with such Packs or Wares to fell to any Inhabitants, Servants, or Slaves whatsoever, shall forfeit his or their Wares and Commodities whatsoever so carried, as aforesaid and that it flnall and may be lawful for any Person whatsoever to apprehend and take such Person and Persons so wandring, travelling, and carrying Goods, in manner aforesaid, and him or them to carry before the next Justice of the Peace to examine the fame; and if upon his Examination he shall find the Person or Persons so brought before him to be Offenders against this Act, that then it shall and may be lawful for such Justice of the Peace to divide all and every the said Goods and Wares, lo carried, as aforesaid, according to the best of his Judgment, and the one half to give and deliver to such Person or Persons that shall apprehend such Person or Persons so offending, as aforesaid, and the other half forthwith to deliver over to the Overseers of the Poor of that Parish where the Person or Persons so offending shall be apprehended, seized, or taken the lame to be to the Use of the Poor of the said Parish, who is to give an exact Account thereof to the Vestry of each such Parish.

And that no Deed hereafter, without such Ac-“ knowledgment and Enrollment, shall pass any Estate of Freehold or Inhe-<r ritance, or any Lease, above the Number of three Years.” Which before jecited Clause, as well negative as affirmative, was, on the seventh of Oflo-ber, One thousand fix .hundred fifty and two, repealed.; and supplied by one Act, containing as foUoweth,.ct That no Deed mall be sufficient in Law to “ bar a real Purchaser to pass any Estate of'Land, unless the fame be acknow-<c ledged before the Governor, or one of the chief Judges of one of the *5 Courts within this. Eland, and enrolled at length in the Secretary’s Office £C within, three Months of the Date and Delivery thereof : And in case, the <e Grantor shall refuse, or doth nor, on Summons, appear to acknowledge the <c fame, then upon Proof made by any of the Witnesses before such Governor *c or Judge, that the said Deed was duly sealed and t delivered within the said time, mall be sufficient for recording the fame.” Which said Act, made Amo One thousand six hundred fifty and two, not being made under kingly

By which Misapprehension and yet Re-establishnient of the afore recited Clause of that Act made Anno One thousand six hundred forty arid nine, without due Provision, would occasion many and great Inconveniencies to the Inhabitants of this Place, the Representatives of the Inhabitants of His Majesty’s Island do therefore desire that it may be declared and enacted, audit is here-thereof Arts, by enacted and declared by the Deputy Governor, Council, and Alfem b ly,1cnufe5iir. and by Authority of the same, That no Deed made since the eleventh of September, One thousand six hundred forty and nine, or that hereafter shall be made, shall be sufficient in Law to bar a real Purchaser, unless it be acknowledged and proved before the Resident Governor, or chief Judge of one of His Majesty’s Courts of Common Pleas within this Island for the time beingj and recorded at length in the Secretary’s Office of this Island within three Months after the Enfealing and Delivery thereof, in case the said Purchaser be ignorant of any former Conveyance thereof.

Relation being therunto had, may and doth more at large appear. And whereas by Virtue of the said Earl of Car-li/le's Patent, divers Governors and Agents have been sent over hither, with Authority to lay out, set, grant, or convey in Parcels, the Lands within this Island, to such Persons as they should think fitwhich was by them, in their respective times, as much as in them lay, accordingly performed. And whereas many have lost their Grants, Warrants, and other Evidences for their said Lands, and others, by reason of the Ignorances of those times, want sufficient and legal Words to create Inheritances in them and their Heirs that never recorded their Grants or Wai rants; and others.

Proof of any Grants or Warrants they ever had for their Lands, and yet have been long and quiet Possessors of the fame, and bestowed great Charges thereon. And whereas the Acknowledgment of Forty Pounds per Head, and other Taxes and Compositions formerly raised to the Earl of Carlisle, was held very heavy : For a full Remedy therefore for all the defects afore related, and quieting the Possessions, and settling the Tenures of the Inhabitants of this Island, Be it enacted by his Excellency brands Lord Willoughby of Parham, &c. his Council, and Gentlemen of the Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, That notwithstanding the Defects afore related, all the now rightful Possessors of Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments within this Island, according to the Laws and Customs thereof, may at all times repair unto his Excellency for the full Confirmation of their Estates and Tenures ,• and then and there shall and

Am be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every the Payments of Forty Pounds of Cotton per Head, and all'other Duties, Rents, and Arrears of Rents, which have or might have been levied, be from henceforth absolutely and fully released and made void and that the Inhabitants of this Island have and hold their several Plantations to them and their Heirs for ever, in free and common Soccage, yielding and paying therefore at the Feast of St. Michael every Year (if the fame be lawfully demanded) One Ear of Indian Corn to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors for ever, in full and free Discharge of all Rents and Services for the future whatsoever, in Consideration of the Release of the said Forty Pounds, and in Consideration of the Confirmation of all Estates in this Island, as aforesaid, and in Acknowledgment of His Majesty’s Grace and Favour, in fending to and appointing over us His said Excellency, of whose Prudence and moderate Government we have heretofore had large Experience, and do rest most afluifed thereof for the future.

Four and a half in Specie for every Five Score. ‘

A n d be it further enacted and declared by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Goods before mentioned, on which the said Custom is imposed and due by this Act, shall at any time hereafter be shipped or put into any Boat or other Vessel, to the Intent to be carried into any Parts beyond the Seas (the said Imposition due for the fame not paid, compounded for, or lawfully ten-dred to the Collectors or their Deputies, or not having agreed with the Commissioners for that Purpose to be appointed, of their Deputies, for the lame, according to the true Intent and Meaning of the said Act) that tbeh, and' from thenceforth, shall the said Goods be Forfeit, the one Moiety thereof to be to our Sovereign Lord the King, and the other to him that shall inform, seize,' and sue for the fame in any Court of Record within this Island, Which Grants are left to your Excellency’s own way of Levying, in fufl .Confidence and Afc furance, that your Excellency will take such Course for the cbUe&iftg and gathering of the said Impost, without any Charge, Duty, or Fees, as majr tfe most; for the Ease of the People of this IflancL

And whereas the Fees of the respective Matfhals of the said Courts for levying Executions have been hitherto variously construed, to the great Injury of many of the Inhabitants of this Island,'" sometimes computing the said Fee in Sugar, but most commonly in Money, which proves very inconvenient : For Remedy of which various Confirmation for the future, Be it declared and en- Ckufciti. ailed by the Authority aforesaid, That the Marshal levying any Execution, ^rniai_^Fces shall for the future, computing and taking his Fee aforesaid, commute the Mo- Execuaons. nies, if the Execution be in Monies, into Sugar, at Twelve Shillings and Six Pence per Hundred, and shall charge Four per Cent, for the First Thousand Pounds of Sugar, Three for the Second, and Two per Cent, for all above; which Fee being thus computed, the Marshal shall receive in Money at Twelve Paid in^Money Shillings and Six Pence per Hundred, and no more. cent.

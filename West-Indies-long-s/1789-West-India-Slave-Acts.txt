WILLIAM STUART.

By his Honour's Command,

DAVID POLSON.

Duly published in the Town of Roseau, this 23d Day of August, 1773.

AUG. GOUJON, D.P.M.

Recorded and examined this 23d Day of August, 1773.

An Act in Aid of an Act, intituled, “An Act for the suppressing of Runaways, for the better Government of Slaves, &c.” commonly called The Slave Act, and to alter and to amend the same; and further to provide a Fund for defraying the Expence necessary for the Encouragement of a Party of Rangers employed for the Purpose of suppressing such Runaway Slaves; and to oblige the Inhabitants of this Island to make true Returns, from Time to Time, of all their Slaves run away, as also for the Transportation of such Runaway Slaves as may be taken or surrender, who may appear dangerous to the Community.

[Preamble.]

WHEREAS a certain Act of this Island, intituled, “An Act for suppressing Runaway Slaves, and for the better Government of Slaves, &c.” commonly called The Slave Act, hath by Experience been found inadequate to effect the Purposes thereby intended: And whereas since the passing of the said, Act the Gangs of Runaway Negroes and Slaves have greatly increased in Numbers and Audacity, and have of late been guilty of divers Robberies, Murders, and other atrocious Crimes, insomuch that it is become absolutely necessary to take the most vigorous Steps to suppress them effectually: And whereas Mr. La Font Beaurrusseau, of this Island, Planter, hath entered into an Agreement with the Council and Assembly thereof to collect a sufficient Number of Persons, who, under his Direction and Command, are to act as a Company of Rangers, in order to effect the total Suppression of Runaway Slaves: In consequence whereof it is become necessary to pass a Law to raise a Fund sufficient to defray the Expence of such an Undertaking, and to oblige the Inhabitants, when required, to give in exact Returns of their Slaves, and of such of them as are or shall hereafter become Runaways, as also to alter and amend the hereinbefore-recited Act, so far as respects the present Undertaking:

[Clause I.]

Be it, and it is therefore hereby Enacted and Ordained by the Governor, the Council, and the Assembly of this Island, and by the Authority of the same, that from and after the Day of the Date of the Publication of this Act, every Proprietor of a Runaway Slave taken by the said Party of Rangers shall pay into the public Treasury of this Island, as follows, that is to say, for every Man and Woman Slave, Three Pounds Six Shillings, and for every Slave under the Age of Ten Years, One Pound Thirteen Shillings Current Money; and that where the Proprietor, or some other Person for the Proprietor, shall not appear to claim any Foreign Slave or Slaves not owned or belonging to this Island, so taken as aforesaid, and to prove the supposed Proprietor’s Title to and Property in such Slave, within Thirty Days after a Description of such Slave shall have been Three Times inserted in the Public Gazette printed at Saint Pierre’s, Martinique and Basse-terre Guadeloupe, then and in such Case such Slave shall be deemed forfeited, and shall be sold by the Provost Marshal, for the Benefit and Uses of the Colony; and every Proprietor of a Runaway Slave shall be obliged and is hereby required, within Thirty Days after any such Slave hath surrendered, to make a Return in Writing, in the Colony Treasury Office of this Island, of the Name, Sex, Age, and Time of such Slave being absent, under the Penalty of Two Johannes’s for each, in the Case of Neglect, and the Penalty of Four Johannes’s in the Case of Refusal to make such Return as aforesaid.

[Clause II.]

And it is hereby Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That in case any Runaway Slave shall be wounded or killed by any of the Party of Rangers, or others than the said Party, the Proprietors of such Slaves, or of any Slave or Slaves who shall be executed hereafter under this Act, shall be entitled to the same Recompence or Compensation as they would be entitled to claim in the like Case under the Act commonly called The Slave Act, now in Force.

N° 2. Dominica. 15

[Clause III.]

And it is hereby further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Party of Rangers to be employed, or any of them, or any Person or Persons in anywise assisting to take and suppress Runaway Slaves, shall not be liable to pay any Loss or Damage which shall fall on any Proprietor or Renter of a Runaway Slave, or any Slave resisting the Party of Rangers in the Execution of this Act, in case any such Slaves are wounded or killed.

[Clause IV.]

And it is hereby further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the same Powers and Authorities as by the hereinbefore-mentioned Act, commonly called The Slave Act, is vested in Parties going out in Pursuit of Runaway Slaves, under the Authority of Magistrates, is hereby given to and vested in the Party or Parties of Rangers, acting under or by virtue of this present Act.

[Clause V.]

And it is hereby further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That in case any of the Clause Slaves who may or shall be hired by the Party of Rangers to carry Provisions or other Necessaries, or to serve as Guides, shall be killed, wounded, or otherwise hurt, being actually employed on that Duty, the Proprietor of such Slave shall receive out of the public Treasury of this Island, within the Space of T hree Months after he shall have been so killed or hurt, the Amount of the Value of such Loss or Damage which shall be ascertained by the Appraisement (before or after going out) of Two credible Persons residing in the Neighbourhood of the Parish, or Plantation, or Town where such Slave usually resided, and who have known such Slave at or about the Time when he went out in the Employ of the Party of Rangers as aforesaid, One of which Appraisers shall be nominated by the Owner or Renter, or some Person acting for such Owner or Renter, and the other by the nearest Justice of the Peace; and in case the Two Appraisers so named cannot agree in Opinion with respect to the Loss or Damage to be valued, they shall then chuse a Third Person, whose Determination shall be final with respect to the Amount in Value of the actual Damage suffered, which Appraisement and Arbitration (as the Case may be) shall be made in Writing, and be signed by the Appraisers and Arbitrators, or Umpire, and shall be delivered to the Owner, Renter, or Person acting for such Owner or Renter of the Slave injured.

[Clause VI.]

And it is hereby further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Rewards and Recompences enacted and ordained to be paid to Persons apprehending or killing Runaway Slaves, shall cease from the Publication of this Act, and that no Reward or Recompence whatever shall be claimed or paid, during the Continuance of this Act, for the apprehending or killing of any Runaway Slave, other than the Rewards or Recompences contained herein, any Thing contained in any other Act of this Island now in Force to the contrary notwithstanding.

[Preamble.]

And whereas it is thought just and equitable that the Expences attending the Expedition for the apprehending and, suppressing of Runaway Slaves should in some Manner be sustained by their Proprietors, who will reap considerable Benefits from their Slaves Return, by being taken or forced to Surrender, as well as from their being deterred from running away in future: And whereas some of such Proprietors, with a View of saving the Expences to be incurred, may omit making exact Returns of such their Runaway Slaves:

[Clause VII.]

Therefore be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That every Proprietor who on or after the Date of the Publication of this Act shall have one or more Slaves surrender to him, or any Person acting for him, shall, within Thirty Days after such Return or Surrender, give Notice in Writing of the Name, Age, Sex, and Description, with the Time of being absent, of each and every such Slave so surrendered or returned, and deliver the same into the Treasury Office of this Island, under the Penalty of Six Pounds Twelve Shillings for neglecting, for each Slave so neglected, and Thirteen Pounds Four Shillings Currency for every Slave refused to be returned in Manner herein directed.

[Clause VIII.]

And it is hereby further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That every Proprietor of a Slave or Slaves shall, at any Time after the Publication of this Act, when thereunto summoned by any Justice of the Peace, appear before such Justice, and make Oath as to any Slave or Slaves run away from him, and to such of them as shall have surrendered, in Manner as follows: viz.

I A. B. of the Parish of C. in the Island of Dominica, do solemnly swear of the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, That on the _____ Day of _____ 1782, I had [or had not any, as the Case may be] Slaves absent or runaway from my Service [or as the Case may be] and no more; and the Names, Age, Sex, Description, and Term of Absence, and also those of such as have returned or surrendered since the said Day, are, as nearly as I can ascertain, truly and faithfully set forth hereunder: Which Oath I have taken and subscribed without any Evasion or mental Reservation whatsoever, so help me God.

[(Slaves Names,

16 N° 2. Dominica.

Ages, Time of Absence, Description of each, when returned or surrendered).]

Sworn before me, &c. D. E. Justice. (Signed) A.B.

Which Oath shall be left in the Hands of such Justice, who shall forthwith cause the same to be delivered into the Colony Treasury Office in Roseau; and in such Case, if any Person shall take a false Oath, such Person shall be liable to be indicted, and if convicted of having wilfully sworn falsely, shall suffer the like Pains and Penalties as Persons are by Law liable to for and in Cases of wilful and corrupt Perjury; Persons neglecting to take such Oath for the Space of Ten Days after they shall have been thereunto required in Writing, shall forfeit the Sum of Six Pounds Twelve Shillings, and Persons refusing shall forfeit Thirteen Pounds Four Shillings Currency for each Refusal to take such Oath as is hereby directed, such Fines to be paid into the public Treasury for the public Uses of this Island; and every Justice of the Peace in this Island is hereby required and directed, when and so often as he shall be ordered by the Commander in Chief, or by the Council and Assembly, to cause to be summoned each and every Person residing in his Parish, being a Proprietor or Renter of One or more Slaves, to appear before him at such Time and Place such Justice shall appoint to take such Oath as aforesaid; and such Justice shall, within Fifteen Days then next following, cause the said Oath or Oaths so taken before him to be delivered into the Colony Treasury Office.

[Preamble.]

And whereas it appears to be absolutely necessary for the future Security of this Colony, that Runaway Slaves, who have not been guilty of any other Crimes, in Addition to that of running away, should be transported to some distant Country, so as to be put as much as possible out of their Power to return again to their Malpractices in( this Island;

[Clause IX.]

An Act to alter and amend an Act of this Island, published the twenty-third Day of August, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-three, intituled, An Act for suppressing of Runaway Slaves, and for the better Government of Slaves, and for preventing Slaves from being fraudulently carried off this Island; and for enabling the Commander in Chief, or President of the Council (for the Time being) to send out Detachments of Free Mulattoes, Free Negroes, and other Free Persons, being Male Descendants of Negroes, in Pursuit of Runaway Slaves and to ascertain what Share of the Rewards given by a late Act such Detachments shall be entitled to.

[Preamble.]

WHEREAS in and by the Thirty-fourth Clause of the said Act, intituled, “An Act for the suppressing of Runaway Slaves, and for the better Government of Slaves, and for preventing Slaves being fraudulently carried off this Island; and for enabling the Commander in Chief, or President of the Council (for the Time being) to send out Detachments of Free Mulattoes, Free Negroes, and other Free Persons, Male Descendants of Negroes, in Pursuit of Runaway Slaves;“ it is Enacted that no Free Mulattoe Man, Free Negro Man, or other Free Man, Desendant of a Negro, to be sent out in Pursuit of Runaway Slaves, shall be compelled by virtue of this Act to serve in Detachments any longer Time than Eight Days at any One Time: And whereas it is found by Experience that the said Space of Eight Days, allowed by the said Act, for the Commander in Chief or President of the Council for the Time being, by and with the Advice of His Majesty’s Council, to continue Detachments of Free Mulattoes and other Free Persons of Colour in Pursuit of Runaway Slaves, is much too short a Time to effect any good Service to the Colony: And whereas the Rewards for apprehending Runaway Slaves in and by an Act lately passed, intituled, “An Act for suppressing Runaway Slaves, and for raising a Fund to reward Persons who shall apprehend them; and for continuing in Force, during the Continuation of this Act, the Prohibitions contained in an Act of this Island, intituled, An Act for the Preservation of Game and Fish,” are very considerably increased:

N° 3.

An Act for the Encouragement, Protection, and better Government of Slaves.

[Preamble.]

WHEREAS the different Acts of this Island for the Government and Protection of Slaves are expired; and whereas it is highly expedient that a System of Laws for the Encouragement, Protection, and better Government of Slaves, founded on Principles of Policy, Justice, and Humanity, should be Enacted; We, Your Majesty’s dutiful, loyal, and obedient Subjects, the Governor, Council, and Assembly of this Your Majesty’s Island of Dominica, do humbly pray Your Most Excellent Majesty, That it may be Enacted and Ordained.

[Clause I.]

And be it, and it is hereby Enacted and Ordained by the Authority of the same, That every Owner, Renter, Manager, or Overseer of any Slave or Slaves, shall feed, or cause to be fed, all such Slave or Slaves as shall be under his, or her, or their Care, with a sufficient Quantity of good and wholesome Food; and shall give them good and sufficient Cloathing, and shall provide dry and comfortable Lodging for them, and in case of the Sickness of any of the said Slave or Slaves, the said Owner, Renter, Manager, or Overseer, shall provide for the said Slave or Slaves proper Medical Assistance and Advice; and the said Owner, Renter, Manager, or Overseer, shall provide, within the Boundary of his, her, or their Plantation or Lot of Land, comfortable Lodging, wholesome Food, and Medical Assistance, for all and every old, infirm, and distempered Slave or Slaves; and if any Owner, Renter, Manager, and Overseer of any Slave or Slaves shall neglect to feed and cloath his, her, or their Slave or Slaves, or shall neglect, in case of Sickness, to provide for the said Slaves or Slaves proper Medical Assistance and Advice, and comfortable Lodging, or shall neglect to provide comfortable Lodging, wholesome Food, and Medical Assistance, for all and every old, infirm, and distempered Slave or Slaves, within the Boundary of his, her, or their Plantation or Lot of Land, such Owner, Renter, Manager, or Overseer, shall be fined in a Sum not exceeding One hundred Pounds, at the Discretion of Three or more Magistrates, for a Neglect of any of the Regulations laid down by this Clause; which Sum shall be levied by Warrant, under their Hands and Seals, on the Goods and Chattels of the Offender or Offenders, and directed to any Constable or Constables of this Island, and paid into the public Treasury of this Island* for the public Uses thereof.

[Preamble.]

And whereas it is expedient that the Slaves in this Island should be encouraged as much as possible in the Cultivation of their Grounds, for the better Subsistence of themselves and Families;

[Clause II.]

Be it, and it is hereby further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That the Owner, Renter, Manager, or Overseer of such Slave or Slaves, shall have the Option of feeding his, her, or their Slaves, by allowing them a sufficient Quantity of good and wholesome Food, or by allotting to each and every of them a sufficient Portion of Land for that Purpose, and certain Times for cultivating it, over and above the Sundays and Holidays hereinafter prescribed: Provided always, That the said Owner, Renter, Manager, or Overseer, in case the said Slave or Slaves should not have received proper and sufficient Food and Nourishment, shall be fined in a Sum not exceeding One hundred Pounds, to be levied and appropriated in Manner and Form as directed by the First Clause of this Act.

Be it, and it is hereby further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That all Owners, Renters, Managers, or Overseers, or One of them, shall, on every Sunday, on their several Estates or Plantations, and at the most convenient Time of the Day, convene together the Slaves of the said Estate or Plantation,

for the Purpose of performing the Offices of Divine Worship; and the said Owners, Renters, Managers, or Overseers, shall not fail to exhort all Male and Female Slaves who may be unbaptized to receive the holy Sacrament of Baptism; and all the unbaptized Children of Slaves shall, after the Publication of this Act, receive the said Sacrament of Baptism; and, on Neglect of the Performance of these Duties, the said Owner or Renter, Manager or Overseer, shall be fined in any Sum not less than Ten Pounds, nor more than Twenty-five Pounds, to be recovered and appropriated in Manner and Form as directed by the First Clause of this Act.

[Preamble.]

And whereas a Relaxation from Labour on certain Days in the Year, and an Indulgence in innocent Recreations and Amusements, would tend to improve the Health, and add to the Contentment of the Slaves;

[Clause V.]

Be it, and it is hereby further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That the Slaves in this Island (House Servants, Stock Keepers, and Watchmen excepted) shall not be required to labour for their Masters and Owners on any Sunday throughout the Year, on Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, Good Friday, and the Fifteenth Day of August; and in case any One of the said Holidays should fall out on a Sunday, then the Wednesday following is to be allowed such Slave or Slaves in lieu of such Sunday.

[Clause VI.]

And be it, and it is hereby further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That any Slave or Slaves on any Plantation, or in any House in the said Island, are hereby permitted, by and with the Consent and Approbation of the said Owners, Renters, Managers, or Overseers of the said Slaves, on each and every Estate and Plantation in the said Island, and by and with a written Permission of any Two Magistrates in any of the Towns of the said Island, to use any Instrument of Music for the Purpose of Dancing, or in the Indulgence of any innocent Amusement, provided the said Dancing and Amusements are not allowed to continue after the Setting of the Sun if in the Town of Roseau, or after Eight of the Clock in the Evening, if on Plantations; and in case of the Non-observance of any of the said Regulations, the said Owner, Renter, Manager, or Overseer of the said Slave or Slaves, or the Constable or Constables in the Towns of this Island, shall be fined; (that is to say) all Owners, Renters, Managers, and Overseers, for Neglect of any of the Regulations contained in this and the foregoing Clause, in a Sum not exceeding Twenty Pounds; and every Constable or Constables shall be fined in a Sum not under Twenty Shillings, nor above Five Pounds, for Neglect of the Regulations laid down by this Clause, and not preventing and putting a Stop to such Dancing, after having received Information thereof, the said Fine or Fines to be recovered upon Conviction before One or more Justices of the Peace, and appropriated in Manner and Form as directed by the First Clause of this Act.

[Preamble.]

And, in order to secure as far as possible the good Treatment of the Slaves, and to ascertain the Cause of the Decrease of the Slaves, if any such there may be;

[Clause VII.]

Be it, and it is hereby further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That every Owner, Renter, Manager, or Overseer of any Slave or Slaves on every Estate and Plantation in this Island, or some one of them, shall in the Month of January in every Year deliver in on Oath, before any Justice of the Peace for this Island, a Certificate of the Increase or Decrease of the Slaves under his, her, or their Direction, how many have been born, or how many have died within Twelve Months previous thereto, and the Cause of the Death of such Slave or Slaves, to the best of his, her, or their Knowledge and Belief; which Certificate shall be lodged within Ten Days after the Date thereof in the Secretary’s Office of this Island, for the filing of which the Secretary shall be allowed the Fee of Nine Pence Currency for each-Certificate; and if any Owner, Renter, Manager, or Overseer shall fail to deliver in the said Certificate on Oath at the Time appointed by this Clause, he, she, or they shall be fined in the Sum of Fifty Pounds Current Money, to be recovered and appropriated, in Manner prescribed by the First Clause of this Act.

[Preamble.]

And whereas it is necessary to ascertain and fix a proper Distinction in the Gradations and local Consequences of Crimes committed by the Slaves in this Island, with Punishments annexed and corresponding thereto;

[Clause VIII.]

Be it, and it is hereby further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every Slave or Slaves who shall be convicted of the wilful Murder, or who shall have been accessary thereto, of any White Person, Free Person of Colour, or Slave, or who shall be convicted of robbing any Person, of whatever Description or Colour, on the high and public Roads of this Island, or who shall have been accessary

24 N° 3. Dominica.

thereto, or who shall be convicted of deliberately breaking open any Dwelling House or Store, and robbing therefrom, or who shall have been accessary thereto, or who shall be convicted of having set Fire to any House, Outhouse, Store Building, or Cane Piece, or who shall have been accessary thereto, shall suffer Death.

[Clause IX.]

And be it, and it is hereby further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That any Slave or Slaves who shall be convicted of having struck a White Person, or who shall be convicted of having struck a Free Person of Colour, being his, her, or their Master or Mistress, or who shall be convicted of a Theft or Robbery to any Amount above Five Pounds, or who shall have been accessary thereto, or who shall be convicted of an Attempt to rob on the high or public Roads of this Colony, or who shall be convicted of an Attempt to set Fire to any House, Outhouse, Building, or Cane Piece, or who shall be convicted of breaking open any House, Outhouse, or Building, with an Intention of robbing therefrom, or who shall have been accessary thereto, shall suffer Death or such other Punishment, by Banishment or public Whipping on the bare Breech, as shall be inflicted upon him, her, or them, at the Discretion of the Court instituted by this Act for the Trial of such Offenders, provided such public Whipping do not exceed the Number of Thirty-nine Lashes.

[Clause X.]

And be it, and it is hereby further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That any Slave or Slaves who shall assemble at any Time for mutinous and other dangerous Purposes, and who shall refuse to disperse and go peaceably Home to their different Houses and Plantations, when ordered so to do by any White Person whatever, and who shall be convicted thereof, the Ringleader or principal Offender shall suffer Death, and the others, according to the Gradation of their Crimes, shall suffer Death or such other Punishment, by Banishment or public Flogging on the bare Breech, provided such Flogging do not exceed the Number of Thirty-nine Lashes; all which Punishments shall be at the Discretion of the Court instituted by this Law for the Trial of such Offences.

[Preamble.]

An Act for attainting several Negroes therein mentioned; and for the more effectual preventing Negroes from running away from their Masters Service; and for explaining and rendering more effectual an Act, intituled, ”An Act for the better Government of Negroes, and other Slaves.” [1722.

WHEREAS it has been found by Experience, that the Laws now in Force for the better Government of Negroes and other Slaves, and for punishing such as do withdraw from the Service of their Masters, have proved too mild and gentle to curb and restrain them, and that they have so abused the Lenity of the Laws, that great Numbers of them have deserted the Service of their Masters, and fled to the mountainous Parts of this Island, and there have armed and assembled themselves in Bands to oppose their Masters, and any that come in Pursuit of them, and in the Night Time, when they cannot be easily discovered or taken, do frequently commit divers Thefts and Robberies in the Plantations of this Island, to the insupportable Wrong and Damage of many of His Majesty’s good Subjects: And whereas they are daily enticing other Negroes to resort to and join with them; and it is much to be apprehended, that their Numbers will very much increase, without the Aid of some Law to give some extraordinary Encouragement for taking their Chiefs or Ringleaders, and for the inflicting of condign Punishment upon such as shall be taken: And whereas it is notorious that Johnny Congo, belonging to the Honourable Lieutenant General Mathew; Christopher, belonging to William McDowall, Esquire; and Antego Quamina, belonging to Marmaduke Batchelor, Esquire, have for a long Time past, and still do head several armed Bands or Companies of Fugitive Negroes in this Island, and do all that in them lies to entice other Negroes to desert their Masters Service, and join with them; and have themselves committed and been the Occasion of committing many flagrant Thefts and Felonies: We therefore, Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Chief Governor of all Your Majesty's Leeward Charibbee Islands in America, and the Council and Assembly of the Island of Saint Christopher, do most humbly pray Your Majesty, That it may be Enacted; And it is hereby Enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Chief Governor, Council, and Assembly aforesaid, and by the Authority of the same,

And, for the preventing any Negroes or other Slaves deserting their Master’s Service for the future, and also for the encouraging of such as are deserted to return thereto.

N° 11.

ANTIGUA.

An Act for further Prevention of Damages to the Harbours, and Abuses in carrying on the Inland trade of this Island; regulating the Hire and Manumission of Slaves, and for advertising Runaways committed to Gaol.

WHEREAS an Act, intituled, "An Act for regulating the Towns and Harbours, settling of Markets, and encouraging of Wharfs in this Island, and to prevent Abuses in the Fishery about the same," hath been found in general to be a good and useful Law, but it is in some Particulars defective; in others, through Change of Circumstances of the Island, is inconvenient and difficult in the Execution:

I.

And whereas great Damages have arisen to the Harbour of Saint John, and the Cove, by Persons throwing Rubbish and Ballast into the same, who have evaded paying the Fine imposed by the above-recited Act, because no proper Places for receiving the Rubbish and Ballast were appointed pursuant to the said Act: For supplying the refore the said Defects, and rendering the said Law more useful and convenient, we, Your Majesty’s most loyal, dutiful, and obedient Subjects, the Governor of Your Majesty’s Leeward Charibbee Islands in America, and the Council and Assembly of Your Majesty’s Island Antigua, Most humbly pray Your Excellent Majesty, That it may be Enacted and Ordained; And be it, and it is hereby Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That from and after the Publication of this Act all Rubbish and Ballast to be landed from on Board of any Ships or Vessels in the Harbour or Cove of Saint John's, Hull be landed and thrown on the East Part of Rat Island, Twenty Feet above High Water Mark, except such as shall be landed upon public Wharfs, or for repairing old Wharfs, and the immediate erecting of new ones, or any other Uses on Shore; and all Rubbish and Ballast to be landed from on Board of any Ships or Vessels in any other of the Harbours or Coves of this Island shall be landed and thrown Twenty Feet above High Water Mark in some convenient Place; and if any Person or Persons shall land or throw any Ballast or Rubbish nearer High Water Mark than Twenty Feet, shall forfeit Fifty Pounds Current Money of this Island; and if any Person or Persons shall deal or carry away any of the Ballast or Rubbish from Rat Island, after the same shall be landed, shall forfeit Fifty Pounds Current Money, both which Sums of Fifty Pounds to be recovered in.a summary Way before Two or more Justices of the Peace of this Island; and in case any Magistrate shall refuse or neglect, upon Information of any Rubbish or Ballast being landed or thrown contrary to the Intention of this Act. or that the same hath been stole or carried away from. Rat Island after landed, to hear and determine the same, he shall forfeit the Sum of One hundred Pounds Current Money of this Island, to be recovered in any Court of Record of this Island, by Bill, Plaint, Information, or Action of Debt, wherein he shall not be allowed any Essoign, Protection, or Wager of Law.

II.

And whereas it hath often happened, that when Vessels have sunk in the Harbours or Coves of this Island, the Owners and Proprietors of the said Vessels have suffered the same so sunk to remain, whereby great Banks are gathered, and Shoal Ground occasioned, which greatly damages the said Harbours and Coves, by filling them continually; Be it therefore Enacted, That if any Person or Persons, being Owner or Owners, Proprietor or Proprietors, Purchasor or Purchasors of any Vessel so funk in the said Coves or Harbours, shall fluffier them to remain for the Space of Two Calendar Months, the Owner or Owners, Proprietor or Proprietors, Purchasor or Purchasors of the said Vessels, shall be proceeded against in like Manner as in case of throwing Rubbish or Ballast: into the said Coves or Harbours, and shall be fined Fifty Pounds Cm rent Money for the First Offence; and in case the same is not removed after such Two Months, then the Owner or Owners, Proprietor or Proprietors, Purchasor or Purchasors of such Vessels, shall be fined Fifty Pounds for every Month such Vessel shall so remain unremoved, after the Lid Two Months, such Finos to be recovered in the same Manner as the Fine for throwing Rubbish or Ballast into the said Coves or Harbours; and the Town Wardens of the Town of Saint John for the Time being are hereby authorized and required to present all such Nuisances in the said Harbours and Coves before Two or more Justices of the Peace, and after Order of such Justices thereon, to fee the same removed, under the Penalty of Fifty Pounds, to be recovered and applied in Manner hereafter mentioned.

N° 11. Antigua. 63

III.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That no Human or other dead Body be hereafter thrown into any of the Harbours or Coves, under the like Penalty of throwing Rubbish or Ballast therein, and to be recovered in the same Manner.

IV.

And whereas great Inconveniences have arisen to the Inhabitants, and the Trade of this Island hath greatly suffered by Persons sending Goods and Merchandizes about the Towns and in the Country to sell, by Way of hawking and pedling; To prevent which, Be it further Enacted, That if any Person or Persons shall hereafter send out any Person, being Free or Slave, with salted Beef or Pork, or with Bread or Biscuits, or with Goods, Wares, or Merchandizes of any Sort, in Baskets, Boxes, or Trunks, or otherwise, to be sold in any of the Towns or Country by Way of hawking and pedling (except salted Beef and Pork, salt Fish, Bread and Biscuit, as shall be sold in the Negro Market on the usual and customary Days) all such Goods, with whatever they shall be contained in, shall be forfeited to any Person that shall carry the same before the next Ju(lice of the Peace, who shall award the same to the Person so bringing them before him, and give him moreover a Certificate signifying his having so done, and mentioning the Name of the Slave from whom the same were taken, to whom, belonging, and the several Particulars awarded, which Certificate, together with this Act, may be given in Evidence upon any Indictment, Information, or Action for Damages, in any Suit or Prosecution against the Person to whom the same shall be adjudged; and if a Verdict be given in his Favour, or a Judgment by Confession, upon Default or Demurrer, he shall be allowed Treble Costs: Provided always, That Cordial Waters or strong Waters (Rum excepted) Fresh Provisions, Feathered Fowl, Fruits, Roots, and Vegetables of the Earth, may be carried to the Towns, and there fold publicly in the Streets, and may be fold in any of the High Roads, or any other Part of this Island, any Thing hereinbefore contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

V.

And be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person whatsoever shall employ any Slave in selling or disposing of any Wares, or Merchandizes, in Shops or otherwise, such Person, upon Proof, by Confession or Oath of One Witness, of such Slave's having been so employed, shall forfeit, for each Offence, the Sum of Five Pounds Current Gold and Silver Money to any Person that shall inform, to be recovered before One or more of His Majesty’s Justices of this Island,

VI.

And whereas a Custom hath prevailed for several Years past, of permitting Slaves to go about the Towns and Country to hire themselves out, or to take their own Liberty, and pay their Masters and Mistresses for their Time, by which Means many Negroes who were actually Runaways, under Pretence of working our, or being at Liberty to hire themselves, have been employed in the Towns and Country unknown to their Masters or Mistresses, and often Robberies are committed by such Slaves; and although an Act was passed in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Two, for the better Government of Slaves and Free Negroes, in which a severe Penalty was laid on any Person or Persons who should employ or keep in his, her, or their Possession any Slave or Slaves longer than Twenty-four Hours without sending such Slave or Slaves to his, her, or their Owner or Owners; yet from the afore-mentioned Custom it has been extremely difficult to put the said Act in Execution: To prevent such Abuses for the future, Be it further Enacted, That if any Master or Mistress, Owner or Renter of any Slave, or any other Person or Persons whatsoever, shall order or direct, or shall knowingly permit or suffer any Slave, on any Pretence whatsoever, to go at Large, and be it Liberty to hire him or herself out, and to seek for Business or Employment of any Kind, either in the Towns or in the Country, or that shall knowingly permit or suffer any Slave or Slaves, to sell and dispose, in his, her, or their Plantation or Plantations, or in any House or other Place whatsoever belonging to him, her, or them, or by Water, any Goods, Wares, and Merchandizes whatsoever (except as in this Act is hereinbefore excepted) or to slay or sell, upon the proper Account of such Slave or Slaves, any Beef, Veal, or Mutton, or shall take or receive from any Slaves or Slave any Sum or Sums of Money, or other Confederation, for allowing or giving up such Slave his or her own Time, such Master or Mistress, or Renter, shall forfeit not less than Five Pounds, or more than Ten Pounds, to any Person who shall inform before any Two Justices of the Peace, who are hereby required to hear and determine the same; and any Person that shall employ, hire, or take into his or her Service, any Slave belonging to another Person, without Agreement and Consent of that other Person, or shall pay or cause to be paid to any Slave, though openly and legally rented to him or her, the Wages due for the Work or Labour of such Slave, or any Part thereof, but by Order, Direction, and Consent of the Person from whom such Slave is hired, shall forfeit the Sum of Five Pounds to the Informer, over and above any Penalties already inflicted by former Laws, to be recovered in a summary Way, as the other Fines are by this Clause; and if any Slave or Slaves shall, without the Privity or Knowledge of his or her Master, Mistress, Renter, Possessor, or Overseer, go about the Country seeking for Business or Employ, or shall sell any Goods, Wares, or Merchandizes, it shall be lawful for any Person meeting with or knowing of any such Slave, to carry him or her to any Justice of Peace, who is hereby authorized and empowered to order him or her

64 N° 11. Antigua.

any Number of Stripes, not exceeding Fifty; and if such Slave shall assert that he or she was to give any Thing for his or her Liberty, or that he or she had Leave from his or her Master, Mistress, Renter, Possessor, or Overseer, to seek out for Labour as aforesaid, the said Justice is hereby required to order such Master, Mistress, Renter, Possessor, or Overseer, before him, and if he or she refuse to clear him or herself by Oath, or (being a Quaker) by solemn Affirmation, he or she shall be looked upon as consenting to such Slave’s having his or her Liberty, and shall be liable to the Penalty in this Clause first mentioned, to be recovered as aforesaid, save and except that nothing in this Clause contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to any Negro Men Slaves who are or shall be employed in the Towns as Porters, provided such Slave or Slaves so employed do always carry a Badge, made of a broad Piece of Lead, hung round his or their Necks, with the Word 'Porter’ marked or stamped on it, and that they always have a Ticket from his or their Owner, Master, Mistress, or Renter, signifying his, her, or their Permission of such Slave or Slaves being employed as Porters; and if any such Porter Slave shall refuse to work by the Day or by the Jobb, or shall require, by Agreement before-hand, or Demand after such Labour done, any exorbitant Price for such Labour, it shall be lawful for any Justice of the Peace to hear a Complaint for such Refusal to work, or exorbitant Hire taken or demanded, and punish such offending Slave at Discretion, according to the Heinousness of the Offence, and every Justice of the Peace shall hear and determine such Complaints without demanding or taking any Fee for the same.

VII.

And whereas a barbarous and inhuman Custom hath prevailed, of manumitting and setting Free Slaves diseased, blind, aged, or otherwise disabled from working, and at the same Time no Ways providing proper Cloathing, Habitation, and Sustenance for such Slaves, but suffering them to ramble about and beg for their Subsistence; Be it therefore Enacted, That if any Person or Persons shall hereafter manumit or set free any Slave or Slaves, he, she, or they, or the Representatives of such Person or Persons, shall provide a proper House and sufficient Cloathing and Diet for such Slave or Slaves, and if any Slave or Slaves so freed shall afterwards be found rambling or begging through the Neglect of such person or Persons, he, she, or they, or their Representatives, shall be fined, upon good Proof, by any Two Justices of the Peace, in any Sum not exceeding Twenty Pounds, or less than Five Pounds, One Half to the Informer and the other to the Public; to be disposed of as hereinafter directed; and any Person suffering any Slave or Slaves blind, diseased, aged, or otherways disabled from working, to ramble or beg about the Towns or Country, such Person so offending shall be punished in the same Manner as if he, she, or they had regularly manumitted and neglected to make proper Provision as aforesaid.

VIII.

And whereas, by an Act for the better Government of Slaves and Free Negroes, dated the Twenty-eighth of June One thousand Seven hundred and Two, It is Enacted, that the Provost Marshal or his Deputy shall receive into the Common Gaol all Runaway Negroes not knowing or confessing their Master’s Name, and shall fix a List of such Slaves at the Prison Door, which Slaves so brought to him, and lying in Gaol Three Months, are by the said Act ordered to be sold; which said Circumstance of fixing Lifts at Prison Doors only hath been found to be detrimental to the Owners of new Negroes so run away, by Reason of the Prison or Gaol being out of the common and ordinary Sight of Owners of Negroes; Be it therefore Enacted, That the Provost: Marshal, or his Deputy, shall and is hereby ordered to cause an Advertisement to be inserted in the Public Gazette of this Island, within Six Days next after receiving such Negroes into the Common Gaol, containing the Name or Names of all such Negroes in his Custody, their Age and Master’s Names, if known, bur if nor, an exact Description of the Persons of such Slave or Slaves, which Advertisement shall be re-published once in every Month while such Negro shall continue in Gaol, under the Penalty of Five Pounds for every Neglect, to be recovered as hereafter mentioned.

IX.

And whereas, through the too great Indulgence of Masters, Mistresses, Owners, Renters, and Overseers of Slaves, or the Ambition of the Slaves themselves, they have endeavoured to imitate White Persons in pompous and expensive Funerals; Be it therefore Enacted, That from henceforth no Slave or Slaves in any of the Towns of this Island shall be buried after Sunset; and that no Slave or Slaves shall be buried in any other than a plain Deal Board Coffin, without any Covering or Ornament, neither shall there be worn any Scarves or Favors at any of their Funerals; and all Persons are hereby declared to have full Power and Authority to seize any Slave or Slaves wearing Scarves or Favors, and them to bring before any One Justice of the Peace, which said Justice may order the said Slave or Slaves any Number of Stripes, not exceeding Fifty, and shall take away such Scarves or Favors, and give them to the Person who brought the said Slave or Slaves so offending before him, for the said Person’s sole Use and Benefit.

X.

And be it further Enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for any Person, Free or Slave, to kill any Swine running at large in the Streets of the said Town of St. John, and all Swine so

N° 11. Antigua. 65

killed shall be the Property of the Person or Persons killing the same, unless claimed or taken away within One Hour after being killed.

XI.

And be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Fines, Fees, or Monies imposed by virtue of this Act, and not particularly specified how to be levied, shall be levied, if under Five Pounds, by Warrant under the Hand and Seal of One Justice of the Peace, and all exceeding Five Pounds by Warrant under the Hands and Seals of Two of more Justices of the Peace, by Distress and Sale of the Offender’s Goods, and for Want of Goods whereon to levy, the Offenders to be committed to the Common Gaol of this Island, and there to remain until the next Court of King’s Bench and Grand Session of the Peace, where they may be punished with Corporal Punishment or Correction as shall be ordered by the Court; and all Monies arising from the Fines laid and imposed by this Act, and not already disposed of, shall go and enure, the One Half to the Informer, and the other Half to the public Treasury of this Island, to be disposed of as the Commander in Chief for the Time being, and the Council and Assembly, shall think fit; but if any Person or Persons shall think him or herself aggrieved by the Determination of any One or more Justices of the Peace out of the Sessions, such Person or Persons may have a Re-hearing of his or their Case before the Justices in Session, on giving Security for his, her, or their Appearance; and in case the same Appeal shall, upon a Re-hearing before the Justices in Session, be found frivolous, he, she, or they shall be punished at the Discretion of the said Justices in Sessions, and shall pay Treble Costs and Treble Fees.

XII.

And be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That this Act shall continue and be in Force for Three Years, from the Publication thereof, and from thence to the next Meeting of the Council and Assembly of this Island.

Dated at St. John's, the Twentieth Day of February One thousand Seven hundred and Sixty-one, and in the First Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord George the Third, by the Grace of God of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, and so forth.

And whereas, from the Vicinage or Nearness of these to Foreign Islands, by which they are exposed and liable to Foreigners emigrating and Colonizing amongst the Inhabitants thereof, many Dangers and Injuries now unforeseen may arise against their Insular Security and Credit, by the too rapid Increase of Wealth or other Power of such Colonists, or of the Connections they may form with the Residents of the same Complexion; Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That no Free Negro, Mulatto, Mustee, or Indian, after the Publication of this Act, shall in future purchase or acquire, by Bequest, or any other Means, or be at any One Time Possessor, Renter, or Employer of more than Fifteen Slaves, unless he or she shall, pursuant to Summons from the Treasurer, or his lawful Deputy, appear in every ensuing Year personally before a Justice of the Peace, at a Place and Time to be appointed, and there and then upon Oath deliver in to him a just and true Account of the whole Number of which he or she does at that Time own, rent, hire, or employ, in his or her own Right; or in the Right of other Persons, and for every one exceeding the Number herein limited shall pay ail Annual Tax of Thirty Shillings Currency, over and above the Yearly Poll Tax, to be appropriated to the Exigencies of the Public, in similar Manner with the Taxes raised in such Year on other Slaves: Provided nevertheless, that no Construction whatsoever of any Part contained in this Act shall imply the Insufficiency of Title to any Land, or to any Slave of Slaves, now held, occupied, or possessed by any and all Free Negroes, Mulattoes, Mustees, or Indians, or their Heirs, but that every and all Persons of that Quality and Complexion, who are in present legal Possession shall in future as heretofore remain in the quiet uninterrupted Enjoyment thereof, without any other than the usual and general Exactions, to all Intents and Purposes, together with all lawful Privileges and Immunities, as if this Law had never been instituted.

Uses in the Treasury, besides paying all Fees incurred by Reason of Default as he in his Discretion shall think, fit to be inflicted on him, her, or them, according to the Nature of the Offence.

[Clause XLI.]

And, for preventing Disorders by those Persons who shall be appointed either by Civil or Martial Law to execute Warrants or Orders, to parade the Pounds for apprehending Runaway or other Transgressing Slaves, and for searching for secreted Goods through and in any of the Plantations, Towns, or Houses, or other Requisitions, according to the Directions contained in this Act, Be it moreover Enacted, That if any Person so appointed, commanded, or required, shall wantonly break open any Negro House, or beat or abuse any Slave, but in Pursuit of a Runaway or Criminal Slave flying or resisting, and due Notice given to the Master, Mistress, Owner, Renter, or Manager, being then present, having the Care of such Plantation, every Offender shall forfeit Ten Pounds Current Money, to be recovered by Complaint and Proof made before any One of His Majesty’s Justices, and, by his Order, to be deposited in the Treasury for public Uses.

[Clause XLII.]

And whereas the unwary Indulgences of Proprietors to their Slaves have crept imperceptibly into great Excess within these Islands, by granting them a Licence of owning and purchasing Slaves and Cattle, by which they become aggrandized, insolent, and contumacious, disregarding the necessary Decorum which ought to be supported in a prudent and well-regulated Police, and most probably will be fraught with most fatal, ruinous, and destructive Events, unless timely checked and prevented; Be it by the Authority aforesaid Enacted, That no Proprietor nor Renter of any Slave shall hereafter permit any of their Slaves to buy or keep any Slave, nor Horses, nor Horned Cattle; and that every Proprietor and Renter shall be and are hereby strictly enjoined, within Thirty Days after the Publication hereof, to take into their own Possession all and every such Slave or Slaves, and Horned Cattle, as their own Property, the Renter accounting to the Proprietor for the full Value thereof: And if it shall be found that any Owner or Renter (or their Representatives) of Slaves owning or possessing other Slaves or Cattle, contrary to this Act, each offending Person shall forfeit such Slave or Horned Cattle, and the same be fold, after Conviction before the Justices, and the Monies arising from such Sales be paid into the Treasury, for the public Uses thereof.

[Clause XLIV.]

And whereas, through the too great Indulgence of Masters, Mistresses, Owners, Renters, and Overseers of Slaves, or the Ambition of the Slaves themselves, they have endeavoured to imitate White Persons in pompous and expensive Funerals; Be it therefore Enacted, That from henceforth no Slave or Slaves shall be buried after Sunset, nor in any other than a plain Deal Board Coffin, without any Covering or Ornament; neither shall there be worn any Scarfs or Favors at any of their Funerals; and all Persons have hereby Power and Authority to seize any Slave or Slaves wearing Scarfs or Favors, and to carry them before any Justice, who shall order the said Slave or Slaves to receive any Number of Stripes not exceeding

[Clause XLVI.]

And be it, and it is hereby Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Justice, Provost Marshal, Treasurer, or their lawful Deputies, or any Constable, shall refuse or neglect to do their respective Duties pursuant to this Act, he or they shall for every Offence forfeit Twenty Pounds.

[Clause XLVII.]

And be it furthermore Enacted, That all Fines, Fees, or Monies imposed by virtue of this Act, and not particularly specified how to be levied, if under Five Pounds, by Warrant under the Hand and Seal of One Magistrate, and all exceeding Five Pounds by Warrant under the Hands and Seals of Two or more Justices of the Peace, by Distress and Sale of the Offender’s Goods and Chattels, and for Want of Goods whereon to levy, the Offenders to be committed to the Custody of the Provost Marshal of these Islands, and there to remain until the Sitting of the next Court of Sessions, or Court of Oyer and Terminer, where they may be punished with Corporal Punishment, or such other Correction as the Court shall order, and all Monies arising from the Fines laid and imposed by this Act, not already disposed of, shall go and enure, the One Moiety to the Informer, and the other Half to the public Treasury of these Islands, to be appointed as the Commander in Chief for the Time being, and the Council and Assembly, shall think fit; but if any Person or Persons shall think him, her, or themselves aggrieved by the Determination of any One or more Justices of the Peace out of Sessions, such Person or Persons may have a Re-hearing of his, her, or their Case before the Justices in Sessions, on giving Security for his, her, or their Appearance; and in case the same Appeal shall upon Re-hearing be found frivolous, he, she, or they shall be punished at Discretion of the Justices in Sessions, and shall pay Treble Costs and Treble Fees.

[Clause XLVIII.]

And be it moreover Enacted, That all such Forfeitures and pecuniary Penalties which maybe incurred by a Disrespect to the Intention and institution of this Act, either by Neglect or otherwise, and have been deemed expedient to be imposed in a summary Way and Process by the Magistrates before whom the several Offenders were convicted, shall be recovered by Warrant of the Justice or Justices who shall try and take Cognizance of the Offences and Crimes, who is and are hereby impowered to and shall issue the same, under their Hands and Seals directed to the Marshal, or his Deputy, or to some One or more Constables of these Islands, to levy the same on the Goods and Chattels of such Defaulters or Offenders, which shall be publicly sold to answer the Amount of the Forfeitures and Penalties, and all such other legal Fees and Costs which shall accrue on the Levy and Sale so executed; and that all Justices, Marshals, and Constables, or other proper Officers, shall be for ever exempt and removed from all Prosecutions whatever, in the Execution and Performance of their Duty, in Obedience to the Requisitions of this Act, wherein no Essoign, Imparlance, Protection, or Wager of Law shall be allowed.

N° 14.

An Act to amend, explain, and make more effectual, an Act made in the Fourth Year of the Reign of King George the First, intituled, ”An Act for the good Government of Slaves.”

WHEREAS there are many Defects in the Law, intituled, ”An Act for the good Government of Negroes and other Slaves” in this Island, and also some Neglects in the Execution of the same, so that the said Act is not effectual to the End for which it was made; we therefore, Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Captain General and Governor in Chief of Your Majesty’s Leeward Caribbee Islands in America, and the Council and Assembly of the Island of Nevis, do humbly pray Your Most Sacred Majesty, That it may be Enacted; And be it Enacted by the King’s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the said Captain General and Governor in Chief, and the Council and Assembly of the Island of Nevis, and by the Authority of the same, That all the Clauses in the said Law now in Force concerning the Government of Negroes and other Slaves, and not hereby altered, shall be duly put in Execution, according to the Tenor of the said Law.

And, for the speedier Punishment of Persons who shall transgress the said Law, Be it hereby Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Persons who shall transgress any Clause of the aforesaid Law, and are by the said Law to be convicted at a General or Quarter Sessions, and no where else, such Persons shall or may, for the Time to come, be convicted before any One Justice of the Peace for this Island, and may be fined by the said Justice according to the Tenor of the said Law; and if the said Fine be not immediately paid, such Justice is hereby impowered, by Warrant directed to the Provost Marshal, or any Constable, to distrain on the Goods and Chattels of such Offenders; and such Distress to sell at public Outcry, to satisfy the said Penalties, rendering the Overplus (if any) to the Owner, any Law, Usage, or Custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.

And whereas it is a common Practice for Negroes to meet in great Companies on the Sabbath Day, feasting, drinking, and gaming, whereby Quarrels, Fightings, and Murders frequently happen, notwithstanding the Penalties imposed by the said recited Act; Be it therefore Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Master or other Person having the Management of a Plantation, shall for the Time to come suffer any Feast to be made on the Sabbath Day, or any other Time, or suffer any Negro Drum, great or small, to be beat for the Space of One Quarter of an Hour at his respective Plantation, such Master or Manager (being convicted thereof before any Justice of the Peace, by the Oath of One credible Person) shall forfeit and pay the Sum of Five Pounds Current Money, and in case of Refusal of Payment, the same to be levied on the Offender’s Goods and Chattels, by Warrant from the said Justice, directed to the Provost Marshal,

82 N° 14. Nevis.

or to any Constable; which Goods so levied on shall be sold at public Outcry within Four Days, if the Penalty be not sooner paid, to satisfy the said Penalty, with Cost, rendering the Overplus (if any) to the Owner, the One Half of which Fines shall be paid to the Informer, and the other Half, to the Poor of the Parish where such Offence shall be committed: and all Slaves who shall make such Feasts, and entertain such Companies, shall moreover be publicly whipped, by Order of the said Justice of Peace, and the Owner shall be obliged to pay the Charges: Provided nevertheless, it is the true Intent and Meaning of this Act, That if the Owner, or other Person having the Management of a Plantation where such Feast shall be made, or Drum beat, shall make Oath before the said Justice that such Feast or Drumming was not by his Consent or Knowledge, in such Case the said Owner or Manager shall not be subject to the aforementioned Penalty.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Constable shall know or be informed of any great Company of Slaves being unlawfully and riotously got together, he is hereby authorized, impowered, and required to take a sufficient Guard and disperse them, and if the said Slaves refuse to disperse by fair Means, it shall and may be lawful for the said Constable to force them to separate, by beating or wounding the m; and if any Constable shall neglect or refuse to do his Duty herein, in separating such Companies of Slaves, or shall know of any Drum, great or small, beaten by Negroes, contrary to the Intent and Meaning of this Act, and shall not inform some Justice of the Peace thereof, such Constable shall (being convicted thereof before any Justice of the Peace, by the Oath of One credible Witness) forfeit and pay the Sum of Five Pounds Current Money, to be levied and applied in the same Manner, and to the same Uses, as other Forfeitures in this Act before mentioned are to be levied and applied.

And whereas by the said recited Act it is Enacted, that if any Negro or other Slave shall suffer Death by virtue of the said Act, the Owner of such Negro or other Slave shall be paid for him out of the public Treasury, not exceeding Thirty Pounds Current Moneys but there is no Provision made for any Payment to the Person whose Slave shall be murdered, or his Goods stolen, whereby many Felonies are compounded, and the Criminals are not brought to Justice: For Remedy whereof, Be it hereby Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Slave for the Time to come shall suffer Death for the Murder of any other Slave, the Owner of the Slave who shall suffer Death shall be paid only the One Half Part of what was allowed by the before-mentioned Act, and the other Half Part shall be paid by the Treasurer to the Owner of the Slave murdered; and if any Slave shall suffer Death for stealing, the Treasurer is hereby required to pay the Person whose Goods were stolen as much as the Justices who condemned the Slave shall certify they were worth (provided the Goods stolen amount not to more than Half the Value of what the Owner of the Slave who committed the Felony is to receive out of the public Treasury; but if the Goods stolen should amount to more than Half the Value, then the Person whose Goods were stolen shall receive the Half Part of what the Owner of the Slave who suffered Death was to have received, and no more) and the Remainder to the Owner of the Slave who shall suffer Death, any Law, Usage, or Custom to the contrary notwithstanding.

And, for the more effectual preventing Slaves who have committed Murder from escaping without Punishment, Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Owner of a Slave who hath committed Murder shall privately convey the said Slave away from the Island, to prevent and avoid his being brought to a Trial, such Person shall forfeit and pay the Sum of Fifty Pounds Current Money, the One Moiety to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, towards defraying the public Charges of this Island, and the other Moiety to the Owner of the Slave murdered, who shall recover such Penalty for the King and himself by Suit, Plaint, Information, or Action Qui tam, &c. in the Courts of King’s Bench and Common Pleas in this Island, where no Essoign, Wager of Law, or more than One Imparlance shall be allowed: And if any Person who hath a Slave murdered by another Slave shall neglect or refuse to prosecute the Murderer, it shall and may be lawful for any other Person to prosecute the Murderer, and if he shall suffer Death for the same, the Person who prosecuted shall receive out of the public Treasury the Sum which the Owner of the Negro murdered would have been entitled to if he had prosecuted, and the Owner of the said Slave shall receive nothing.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That no Slave shall suffer Death for stealing Sheep, Goats, or Hogs under the Value of Five Pounds Current Money, but such Slave shall be publicly whipped by the Order of any One Justice of the Peace; and the said Justice is hereby impowered and required to award Payment to be made by the Owner of such Offender to the Party whose Sheep, Goats, or Hogs were stolen, with Cost, and in case of Refusal of Payment, by Warrant to distrain for the same, and such Distress to sell at public Outcry.

And whereas Negroes frequently come from the Island of Saint Christopher’s in Bark Logs, Boats, and Canoes, to this Island on the Sabbath Day to feast and carouse, and often land secretly in the Night in some private Bay, where they receive stolen Goods, and often clandestinely carry away Negroes from the Island, to the great Detriment of the Inhabitants; Be it hereby Enacted by

N° 14. Nevis. 83

the Authority aforesaid, That if any Negroes shall, after Six Weeks from the Publication of this Act, come to this Island in any Bark Log, Boat, or Canoe, without any White Man of good Credit with him, it shall and may be lawful for any White Person whatsoever to apprehend such Negro or Negroes, and deliver him or them to the Provost Marshal of the Island, or his lawful Deputy, who is hereby authorized, impowered, and required to whip such Negroes in the public Market Place, not exceeding Forty Lashes, and then safely to keep them in the common Gaol of the Island until the Master or Owner shall pay unto the Provost Marshal, or his lawful Deputy, Six Pounds Current Money for each Slave so taken, for the Use, of the Person who shall apprehend them, besides the Gaol Fees; and if the Master or Owner of any such Slave cannot be known, or such Slave shall lie in Gaol for the Space of Three Months, then the Provost Marshal, or his lawful Deputy, is hereby impowered and required to sell such Slave at public Outcry to satisfy the said sum of Six Pounds, and all other Charges, and.to return the Overplus (if any) to the Owner; or if the Owner cannot be found, to the Treasurer of the Island for the Time being, who shall be accountable for the same to the Publique of this Island, or to the Owner of such Slave whenever he shall appear; and the Provost Marshal, or his Deputy, is hereby required, upon putting any Slave delivered unto him as aforesaid in Prison, immediately to put up Publication thereof at the Court House Door, and to give a particular Description of the Slave in the Publication; and no Slave put in Prison as aforesaid shall be sold without such Publication being first made.

And be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Slaves shall for the Time to come go from this Island in any Boat, Canoe, or Bark Log, to any other Island, without a creditable White Person with them, such Slaves shall be publicly whipped by Order of any Magistrate; and if any Slave shall presume to be Owner of any Boat, Canoe, or Bark Log, such Slave shall be publicly whipped, and the Boat, Canoe, or Bark Log shall be burnt by Order of any Justice of Peace.

And forasmuch as Slaves frequently keep Shops in Charles Town, and sell several Sorts of Goods, Wares, and Merchandizes, Rum, and any other strong Liquors in the Town and in the Country to other Slaves, for which they often receive stolen Goods, which is an Encouragement for Slaves to steal from their Masters, and is a Detriment to the Inhabitants; for Remedy whereof. Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That for the Time to come it shall not be lawful for any Slave Whatsoever to keep a Shop in Charles Town, or to sell any Goods, Wares, Merchandizes, Rum, or any other strong Liquors, either for themselves or for their.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That in case any free Person shall purchase any Thing (except such Things only as are before excepted in this Act) from any Slave who hath not a Ticket as is hereinbefore directed, such Person shall, upon Proof made before any Justice of the Peace in this Island, forfeit and pay the Sum of Twenty Pounds Current Money.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person whatsoever shall give any Slave a Ticket in his Owner’s or Manager’s Names, to sell any Thing without the Privity or Consent of such Owner or Manager, such Person shall, upon Proof made before any One Justice of the Peace, forfeit and pay the Sum of Twenty Pounds Current Money.

Anno 1679. N° 30.

WHEREAS there is a general Complaint in this Island of the Liberty that Negroes do assume to themselves in wandering from one Plantation to another on the Sabbath Day, and at other Times, both Day and Night, by which Means many of the Inhabitants are much damnified by several Insolencies, Thefts, and Robberies, which, if not speedily prevented, may very much prejudice the public Welfare of this Island; It is therefore Enacted and Ordained, and be it hereby Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That for the future all Proprietors of Negro or Negroes in or upon this Island, or Overseers of Plantations that shall have any strange or wandering Negro or Negroes come into his, her, or their Plantations, either by Day or Night, on Pretence of any lawful Occasions; and any such Negro or Negroes that shall, after Notice given unto him or them to repair unto his, her, or their Master or Mistress, Owner or Owners, Overseer or Overseers of the respective Plantations where any such Negro, or Slave or Slaves shall so loiter, shall forthwith take any such Runaway or Wandering Slave or Slaves, and punishi him or them, and fend them to the Owner or Owners thereof, Overseer or Overseers of the Plantations unto which they belong; and if any Slave or Slaves shall conceal such, or harbour any such Runaway or Wandering Slave in his, her, or their Cabbins, shall be by the Owner or Owners, Overseer or Overseers of such Concealers, forthwith taken before the next Justice of Peace of this Island, and there, in the Presence of the said Justice, exercise the Punishment of Forty Lashes upon the bare Back of him, her, or them that shall so conceal any Slave or Slaves, and all such Owners or Overseers as shall neglect so to do shall upon Proof thereof be fined Five hundred Pounds of Sugar for His Majesty’s Use, towards the Support of the Government of this Island, any Law, Usage, or Custom in this Island to the contrary heretofore had or made in anywise notwithstanding.

An Act to restrain the Insolence of Slaves, and for preventing them from committing any Outrages; as also the better ordering such Slaves, &c,

Anno 1693. N° 36.

WHEREAS it is notorious that the Negroes not only commit grievous Outrages upon the Inhabitants, by stealing and carrying away their Cattle and other Stock raised for their Subsistence, but are likewise in many Places of this Island got together in such Numbers as to threaten the Disturbance of the Peace and Quiet of the same; we therefore pray their Majesties, that it may be Enacted, And it is hereby Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That henceforward, where any Negro shall be taken dealing or carrying away Stock, Cattle, or Provision, amounting to the Value of Twelve Pence, such Negro or Negroes taken therein shall, upon due Proof thereof before the Governor and Council, suffer such Death as they shall think fit to award; and when any Negro shall have any Theft proved against him, and the Value not amounting to Twelve Pence Current Money of this Island, that then and in such Cases such Negro shall only suffer a severe Whipping, and have both his Ears cut off for the First Time; but for the Second Offence in the like Nature shall suffer Death in the Form aforesaid, the Public paying the Owner for every Negro put to Death the Sum of Three thousand Five hundred Pounds of Muscovado Sugar.

And forasmuch, through the Negroes dealing and destroying poor People’s Provisions they are quite discouraged from planting what they expect not to reap; Be it moreover Enacted and Provided, That it shall and may be lawful for any Person to shoot at, and, if possible, to kill any Negro he shall find digging out, drawing, or dealing his Provision, provided such Provision be not within

N° 17. Montserrat. 89

forty Foot of the common Path, and that the Party so killing the Negro hath not, in the hearing of others, expressed either Hatred or Malice against the Owner of such Negro, for in either Cases the Owner of such shall recover Damages to the full Value of any who shall so kill their Negro.

And since, by the often and frequent meeting of the Negroes on the Lord’s Day, most of the Mischiefs which happen are then by them plotted and contrived; and seeing Masters, Mistresses, and Overseers are very negligent in their several Plantations; Be it therefore further Enacted and Ordained, That no Person whatsoever, being Owners or Overseers, give Leave to any Negro Slave under their Ownership or Charge to depart or leave their Plantations on the Sunday, without a Ticket expressing his or their Business, and whither going, upon Penalty of Three hundred Pounds of Sugar, and having their Negroes severally whipped by the Owner or Owners of such Plantations where they shall be found or taken without a Ticket; and any Owner of a Plantation, or Overseer, who shall neglect to punilli as aforesaid any Negro, without a Ticket being found in his Plantation, or under his Care or Charge, shall forfeit the Sum of Three hundred Pounds of Sugar.

Provided always, and be it further Enacted, That where there are more in Number than One Slave concerned in any heinous or grievous Crimes, as Burglary, Robbery, burning of Houses or Canes, killing or stealing any Manner or Kind of Cattle or Stock, only One of them shall suffer Death, who shall appear to be the greatest Criminal.

And whereas some Masters and Mistresses, or Overseers of Plantations, are so careless as not to put in a Competency of Provision for their Slaves, whereby they are often forced to run away, or at least to commit Thefts and Robberies upon their Neighbours; Be it further Enacted, and it is hereby Provided, That all Masters, Mistresses, and Overseers of any Plantations within this Island, at all Times after the Expiration of Ten Months ensuing the Publication hereof, shall have, and always keep, for every Eight Negroes, One Acre of Ground well planted in Provisions, and so proportion ably for a greater or lesser Number, which whosoever shall neglect, after the Ten Months ended, that then at the End of every Six Months, for every Acre so wanting, shall forfeit the Sum of One thousand Pounds of Sugar.

And it is moreover Provided and Enacted, That where Two Slaves shall fall out and fight, and One maim or kill the other, it shall lie at the Person’s Discretion whose Negro shall be either maimed or killed, whether for the First Offence the Negro who committed the same shall suffer Whipping, or for the latter Death, or to receive such Satisfaction of the Owner of such Negro as the Governor and his Council shall adjudge sufficient.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That where any Person shall attempt to steal or take off this Island, in any Ship, Boat, Sloop, Canoe, Bark, Logg, or other Vessel, any Negro or Negroes shall, for offering the same, forfeit Five thousand Pounds of Sugar, or lie in close Prison for the Space of Six Months; and whatsoever Person or Persons shall steal and carry off from this Island any Negro or Negroes in any such Vessel or Vessels as aforesaid, shall and are hereby esteemed and adjudged guilty of Felony, and shall not have the Benefit of their Clergy.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That where any White shall take a Slave, and bring him in dead or alive, if alive shall have paid him by the Owner of such Negro or Slave the Sum of Five hundred Pounds of Muscovado Sugar; where dead, the same Sum out of the public Stock of this Island; and where any Slave shall take a Runaway, such

90 N° 17. Montserrat.

Negro Slave shall have Three hundred Pounds of Sugar, either by the Owner or Public as aforesaid.

And be it moreover Enacted, That any Person, upon Loss of any Cattle, Stock, or other Provision, may immediately, without going to a Justice of Peace, or requiring a Warrant, repair to any Plantation or Plantations whereof he shall have Suspicion, and there, taking the Masters, Mistresses, or Overseers of the same along with him, shall have full Power to search all and singular the Negro Houses, or other Houses belonging to such Plantation or Plantations, and if Need be to break open any thereof; and any Master, Mistress, or Overseer of a Plantation, who shall make any Resistance, or obstruct them therein, shall pay to the Party who hath sustained any Loss double the Value thereof.

And in as much as there are several Fines, Forfeitures, and Penalties beforementioned in this Act, and not declared where they shall be recovered, and how disposed of; Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That One Moiety be to their Majesties, their Heirs and Successors, for and towards the Support of the Government of this Island, and the contingent Charges thereof, and the other to the Informer, to be recovered by action of Debt in any Court of Record within this Island, by Bill, Plaint, or Information, or otherwise, wherein no Essoign, Protection, or Wager of Law shall be allowed; any Law, Custom, or Usage to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding.

And be it further Provided and Enacted, That any Negro or Slave within this Island, that shall absent themselves from their Master’s or Mistress’s Service for the Space of Three Months, and afterwards taken and convicted thereof, shall suffer Death as a Felon, any Law, Usage, or Custom to the contrary notwithstanding; the Owner of the said Negro to be allowed him, out of the public Stock of this Island, Three thousand Five hundred Pounds of Sugar, as is before provided in this Act.

An Act for repealing a certain Clause in an Act made in the Reign of King William, intituled, “An Act to restrain the Infsolencies of Slaves, and for preventing them from committing any Outrages; as also for the better ordering such Slaves.“

Anno 1714. N° 62.

WHEREAS, by an Act confirmed by King William of glorious Memory, upon the Thirty-first Day of December, in the Year of Our Lord One thousand Six hundred and Ninety-six, intituled, “An Act to restrain the Insolencies of Slaves, and for preventing them from committing any Outrages, as also for the better ordering such Slaves;“ it is especially provided for, in One Clause of the said Act, “That if any Negro or Negroes shall be executed by suffering Death, that the Owner or Owners of such Negro or Negroes shall receive and be paid out of the public Treasury of this Island, the Sum of Three thousand Five hundred Pounds of Muscovado Sugar:“ And whereas it is now found by Experience (to the great Delay of Justice) that several Negroes having committed great Crimes and Misdemeanors, whom in all Probability would have suffered Death, provided they had been brought to Justice, but the Owner or Owners of the aforesaid Negroes, not esteeming the aforesaid Quantity of Three thousand Five hundred Pounds of Muscovado Sugar sufficient and of full Value for the aforesaid Negroes, have endeavoured to conceal the said Negroes, rather than bring them to Justice; We therefore pray Your Most Excellent Majesty, that it may be Enacted and Ordained, And be it, and it is hereby Enacted and Ordained by the Commander in Chief of all Your Majesty’s Leeward Charibbee Islands in America, and the President, Council, and Assembly of Montserrat, That every Clause, Article, Thing or Things of the aforesaid Act, in relation to the Payment of Three thousand Five hundred Pounds of Muscovado Sugar out of the public Treasury of this Island to the Owner or Owners of such Negro or Negroes that shall be so put to Death, shall from henceforward, to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever, be repealed, made void, and of none Effect.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That from and after the Publication of this Act, every Owner or Owners of any Negro or Negroes which shall be so put to Death shall be paid, from and out of the public Treasury of this Island, so much Money or Sugar that any such Negro or Negroes shall be appraised or deemed to be worth, immediately after such Negro or Negroes shall have received Judgment to suffer Death, which Appraisement is to be made by the Lieutenant Governor, or President and Council of this Island; and such Appraisement

N° 17. Montserrat. 91

to be entered in the Book of Records of the Council by the Secretary of the Council, any Law, Custom, or Usage to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

Provided, That nothing in this Act shall be deemed, construed, or taken to repeal or make void any other Clause, Article, Thing or Things in the aforementioned Act.

An Act for the further Restriction of Slaves, by prohibiting them from planting any Indigo, Cotton, Ginger, Coffee, or Cocoa, and from keeping a public Market on Sundays, and for further refraining licentious Meetings of Negroes.

Anno 1736. N° 112.

WHEREAS it appears that the Laws now in Force relating to Negroes and Slaves are not extensive enough to restrain them, and that Lenity and Indulgence, instead of producing the desired Effects, have rather given Encouragement to Robberies and Disorders, by furnishing Pretences whereby the Offenders often escape Punishment: And whereas the Labour and Industry of many of the poorer Sort of People of this Island is defeated by the Thefts of Slaves, who, under colour of planting Indigo, Cotton, Ginger, Coffee, and Cocoa for their own Use, do often steal the said Commodities, to the great Loss and Detriment of the Planters thereof: And whereas the said Commodities, or any stolen Goods or Provisions may easily be disposed of, without the Knowledge of the Owners, at the public Market, which Slaves have been suffered to keep on the Lord's Day, whereon great Numbers of them assemble in and about the Towns of Plymouth and Kinsale, and other Parts of the Island, frequently committing Riots and Disorders, to the great Terror and actually endangering of the Inhabitants; For preventing the refore, as far as may be, such Abuses for the future, We Your Majesty’s most dutiful, loyal, and obedient Subjects, the Governor in Chief of all Your Majesty’s Leeward Charibbee Islands in America, and the Council and Assembly of this Your Majesty’s Island of Montserrat, humbly pray Your Most Sacred Majesty, that it may be Enacted and Ordained, And Be it, and it is hereby Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That any Person whatsoever.

And be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That whatsoever Master, Mistress, Owner, or Renter of any Plantation in this Island, being thereupon resident, and not being abroad from his or her Plantation, and where none such resident on the Plantation, then if any Manager of any such Plantation, and having the Care thereof, and thereon resident and being at Home, or if any Overseer, being at Home, and the Master, Mistress, Owner, or Renter happens to be absent from Home, shall suffer any Slave to beat any Drum or Drums, or empty Casks, or great Gourds, or to blow Horns, Shells, or loud Instruments for the Diversion or Entertainment of Slaves, in his, her, or their Plantation, he, she, or they shall forfeit Twenty Pounds Current Money of this Island for every such Offence, unless they suppress the same in One Hour after the same begins, provided that Information thereof be given upon Oath to One of His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace for this Island, within Three Weeks after the Offence committed.

And it is also Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That on Complaint made to any Justice of the Peace of any Crime done by any Slave or Slaves, such Justice shall issue out his Warrant for apprehending the Offender or Offenders, and for all Evidences; if the said Justice finds such Crime not capital, he may appoint public Correction of such Slave, according to Discretion, but if the Crime be very heinous, then the said Justice shall commit the said Offender to Prison to be tried by the Council as usual.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Fines and Forfeitures in this Act specified, and not declared how and in what Manner to be levied and disposed of, shall be recovered by Warrant from a Justice of Peace to any Constable, if not above Six Pounds, and by Warrant from Two Justices for any Fine exceeding Six Pounds, which Constable is hereby fully empowered to execute the said Warrant, and to take such Fees as shall be thought reasonable and sufficient by the said Justices; One Half of such Fines shall be and enure to the Informer, the other Half shall be to His Majesty, His Heir and Successors, to be paid into the public Treasury of this Island, towards carrying on the Forts and Fortifications, or other public Works of this Island.

Anno 1779. N° 209.

WHEREAS the Laws now in Force in this Island, prohibiting Slaves from planting Cotton, have been found to be ineffectual for answering the Purposes thereby intended; Slaves not only continue to plant Cotton, notwithstanding the aforesaid Prohibitions, but frequently vending stolen Cotton to White Persons and others in the said Island, to the great Prejudice of the White Planters thereof:

And whereas Cotton Wool is the Commodity by which the Poor of this Island are principally supported; for preventing the refore as far as may be such Abuses, and the said Injury done the poor Inhabitants of this Island for the future, and for the encouraging the planting of Cotton in this Island by the poor Inhabitants thereof, We Your Majesty’s most dutiful and obedient Subjects, the Governor in Chief of all Your Majesty’s Leeward Charibbee Islands in America, and the Council and Assembly of this Your Majesty’s Island of Montserrat, humbly pray Your

And, in order to prevent as far as may be the purchasing of Cotton from Slaves in the said Island, Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person or Persons in the said Island shall, after the Publication of this Act, purchase from any Slave or Slaves in the said Island any Cotton Wool, such Person or Persons, on being convicted thereof by Oath before any Magistrate of the said Island, by the Oath of One credible Witness, shall forfeit the Sum of One hundred Pounds Current Money of the said Island, to be recovered by Bill, Plaint, or Information in His Majesty’s Court of King’s Bench and Common Pleas of the said Island; which said Sum of One hundred Pounds, and also the other Penalties hereby imposed, shall be paid into the Hands of the Treasurer of this Island, to be applied to the Repairs of the Forts and Fortifications thereof.

WHEREAS it is notorious, that the Negroes not only commit grievous Outrages upon the Inhabitants, by stealing and carrying away their Cattle and other Stock raised for their Subsistence, but are like wise in many Places in this Island got together in such Numbers as to threaten the Disturbance of the Peace and Quiet of the same; We therefore pray their Majesties, that it may be Enacted; And it is hereby Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That henceforward, where any Negro shall be taken stealing or carrying away Stock, Cattle, or Provision, amounting to the Value of Twelve Pence, such Negro or Negroes taken therein shall upon due Proof thereof before the Governor and Council, suffer such Death as they shall think fit to award; and when any Negro shall have any Theft proved against him, and the Value not amounting to Twelve Pence Current Money of this Island, that then and in such Cases such Negro shall only suffer a severe Whipping, and have both his Ears cut off for the First Time; but for the Second Offence in the like Nature shall suffer Death in the Form aforesaid, the Public paying the Owner for every Negro put to Death the Sum of Three thousand Five hundred Pounds of Muscovado Sugar.

And forasmuch, through the Negroes, stealing and destroying poor People's Provisions, they are quite discouraged from planting what they expect not to reap; Be it moreover Enacted and Provided, That it shall and may be lawful for any Person to shoot at, and, if possible, to kill any Negro he shall find digging out, drawing, or stealing his Provision, provided such Provision be not within Forty Foot of the common Path and that the Party so killing the Negro hath not in the Hearing of others expressed either Hatred or Malice against the Owner of such Negro, for in either Cases the Owner of such shall recover Damages to the full Value of any who shall so kill their Negro.

And since, by the often and Frequent Meeting of the Negroes on the Lord’s Day, most of the Mischiefs which happen are then by them plotted and contrived; and seeing Masters, Mistresses, and Overseers are very negligent in their several Plantations; Be it therefore further Enacted and Ordained, That no Person whatsoever being Owners or Overseers give Leave to any Negro Slave under their Ownership or Charge to depart or leave their Plantations on the Sunday, without a Ticket expressing his or their Business, and whither going, upon Penalty of Three hundred Pounds of Sugar, and having their Negroes severely whipped by the Owner or Owners of such Plantations where they shall be found or taken without a Ticket; and any Owner of a Plantation, or Overseer, who shall neglect to punish as aforesaid any Negro without a Ticket, being found in his Plantation, or under his Care and Charge, shall forfeit the Sum of Three hundred Pounds of Sugar.

And be it further Provided by the Authority aforesaid, That Once in every Month every Master or Mistress, or Overseer of a Family, shall, throughout all his Negro Houses, make diligent Search for and seize upon all Staves, Clubs, or mischievous Weapons they shall there find, as also all stolen Goods and Commodities that shall be found, if of any Value, shall publish the same, describing the Quantity or Quality thereof, that thereby the Owners may be the better able to claim it, in order, upon full Proof made it was theirs, it may be restored them; and for Flesh of any Sort that shall be found, the Negro in whose House it was taken, unless he or she can make it plainly appear they came by it honestly, shall undergo a Whipping, and have One of their Ears cut off.

Provided always, and be it further Enacted, That where there are more in Number than One Slave concerned in any heinous or grievous Crime, as Burglary, Robbery, burning of Houses or Canes, killing or stealing any Manner or Kind of Cattle or Stock, only One of them shall suffer Death who shall appear to be the greatest Criminal.

And it is further Enacted and Provided by the Authority aforesaid, That all Commission Officers within this Island are hereby impowered and required, upon Notice by any One to them given of any Number of Negroes got together, and the Place where, immediately upon the same to raise a sufficient Number of Men, and with them to pursue, apprehend, and take such Negroes, either alive or dead, and whatsoever Commissioned Officer shall neglect, or other Person refuse to be aiding and assisting herein, shall forfeit the Sum of Two thousand Pounds of Sugar.

96 N° 18. Montserrat.

And whereas some Masters and Mistresses, or Overseers of Plantations, are so careless as not to put in a Competency of Provision for their Slaves, whereby they are often forced to run away, or at least to commit Thefts and Robberies upon their Neighbours; Be it further Enacted, and it is hereby provided, That all Masters, Mistresses, and Overseers of any Plantation within this Island, at all Times after the Expiration of Ten Months ensuing the Publication hereof, shall have, and always keep for every Eight Negroes One Acre of Ground, well planted in Provisions, and so proportionably for a greater or lesser Number; which whosoever shall neglect after the Ten Months ended, and that at the End of every Six Months for every Acre so wanting, shall forfeit the Sum of One thousand Pounds of Sugar.

And it is moreover Provided and Enacted, That where Two Slaves shall fall out and fight, and the one maim or kill the other, it shall lie at the Person's Discretion whose Negro shall be either maimed or killed, whether for the first Offence the Negro who committed the same shall suffer Whipping, or for the latter Death, or to receive such Satisfaction of the Owner of such Negro, as the Governor and his Council shall adjudge sufficient.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That where any Person shall attempt to steal or take off this Island, in any Ship, Boat, Sloop, Canoe, Bark Log, or other Vessel, any Negro or Negroes shall, for offering the same, forfeit Five, thousand Pounds of Sugar, or lie in close Prison for the Space of Six Months V and whatsoever Person or, Persons shall steal or carry off from this Island any Negro or Negroes in any such Vessel or Vessels as aforesaid, shall, and are hereby esteemed and adjudged guilty of Felony, and not have the Benefit of their Clergy.

[Preamble.]

WHEREAS it appears that the Laws now in Force, relating to Negroes and Slaves, are not extensive enough to restrain them, and that Lenity and Indulgence, instead of producing the desired Effects, have rather given Encouragement to Robberies and Disorders, by furnishing Pretences whereby the Offenders often escape Punishment: And whereas the Labour and Industry of many of the poorer Sort of the People of this Island is defeated by the Thefts of Slaves, who, under Colour of planting Indigo, Cotton, Ginger, Coffee, and Cocoa for their own Use, do often steal the said Commodities, to the great Loss and Detriment of the Planters thereof: And whereas the said Commodities, or any stolen Goods or Provisions, may easily be disposed of without the Knowledge of the Owners at the public Market, which Slaves have been suffered to keep on the Lord’s Day, whereon great Numbers of them assemble in and about the Towns of Plymouth and Kinsale, and other Parts of the Island, frequently committing Riots and Disorders, to the great Terror and actual endangering of the Inhabitants: For the preventing the refore, as far as may be, such Abuses for the future, we Your Majesty's most dutiful, loyal, and obedient Subjects, the Governor in Chief of all Your Majesty’s Leeward Charibbee Islands in America, and the Council and Assembly of this Your Majesty’s Island of Montserrat, humbly pray Your Sacred Majesty, that it may be Enacted and Ordained; And be it, and it is hereby Enacted by the Authority aforesaid,

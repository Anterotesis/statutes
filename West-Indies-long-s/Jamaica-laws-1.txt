II. And whereas it is usual and customary for Merchants in Great Britain to entrust Cargoes with Persons whom they fend hither as their Factors, for the Disposal thereof, and who come to advance their Fortune in this Island, and to settle and become Inhabitants here, which has brought many People, and been of great Advantage to the Settlement of this Island; but the lame having received great Discouragement likewise, by the Death of some of the said Factors, who having made their Wills, and their Executors not having returned any Inventories of their Goods, it has been impossible for their Principals in Great Britain, by their Agents or Attornies here, to discover the fame, or recover the Value thereof, though they might otherwise have reasonably expected to have been considerable Gainers by their Adventure, which has tended to the great Discouragement of Trade in general, as well as the particular Loss of many Merchants, Adventurers to this Island, as also to the preventing of People's coming to settle amongst us, from the Difcre-dit it brings upon the Inhabitants here : For the Prevention of which, and such like Inconveniencies for the future, be it enacted by her Majesty's Governor,

Council, and Assembly of this Island, and it is hereby enacted by the Authority of the same, That all and every Executor and Executors for the future, when Executor to the Will of any Testator is by him or them exhibited to be proved, shall answer oJ^Yhey” upon Oath to the Value and Circumstances of the Testator's Testamentary Estate iue and cir-to the best of his or their Knowledge, and shall, at the Discretion of the Ordina-cum[lances °/ ry, not only take the Oath of an Executor, but give such Security as the Ordi- Testamentary nary shall direct in the Secretary's Office, to return a just Inventory of the Testa- Estate. for's Estate, with an Appraisment thereof upon Oath, within such Time as shall be limited by the Ordinary for the Time being; any Law, Statute, or Usage to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

Burning of Houses, Canes, Rebellious Conspiracies, or any other Capital Offence whatsoever, he, the said Justice, should iftiie out his Warrant for the apprehending the Offender or Offenders, and for all Persons to come before him that could give Evidence (and the Evidence of one Slave against another, in that and all other Cafes, should be deemed good and sufficient Proof) and if upon Examination it probably appeared, that the apprehended were guilty, he should commit him, her, or them to Prison, and certify to the next Justice the Cause, and require him, by virtue of the said Act, to associate himself to him, which such Justice is thereby required to do; and they so associated should issue out their Warrant to summon Three Freeholders, setting forth to them the Matter, and requiring them, at a certain Day and Hour, and at such a Place as the Justices or Vestry, or the Justices, where no Vestry was, should, as by the fttid Act directed, appoint for such Trials; at which Time and Place the said Justices and Freeholders should causej the said Offender or Offenders, and Evidence, to come before them ; and if they, on hearing of the Matter (the said Freeholders being by the Justices first sworn to judge uprightly and according to Evidence, which Oaths the said Justices were by. the said Act impowered and required to administer) should judge the Criminal or Criminals guilty of the Offence complained of, they or the major Part of them, of whom one to be a Justice, as in all Trials within the said Act, should give Sentence of Death, Transportation, Dif-membering, or any other Punishment, as they in their Judgment should think meet to inflict; and forthwith by their Warrant, cause immediate Execution ft) be done by the common or any other Executioner (Women with Child only excepted.

And by the said Act it is further enacted, That if any Slave or Slaves should compass or imagine the Death of any white Person, and thereof be attainted by open Deed before Two Justices and Three Freeholders, such Slave or Slaves should buffer Death, any Thing in the said Act to the contrary notwithstanding: And in the said Act it is provided, that when and as often as any of the aforementioned Crimes are committed by more than one Slave that should deserve Death (Murder only excepted) that then, and in all such Cafes, only one of the Criminals should buffer Death as exemplary to the rest, who were to be returned to the‘Owners, after having received such Corporal Punishment as the said Justices and Freeholders aforesaid should think fit to inflict. On which Proviso Doubts have arisen, whether the Justices and Freeholders could by the said Act give Sentence of Death against more than one Slave for one and the fame Crime; and whether they could order any to be transported for any of the aforesaid Crimes, except in Cafes where a Murder had been actually committed : For obviating which Doubts, and for ap Explanation of the said Act, may it please your most Excellent Majesty that it may be enacted and declared; and be it enacted and declared by the Governor, Council, and Assembly of this your Majesty's Island, and it is hereby enacted and declared by the Authority of the same, That it was the true Intent and Meaning of the said recited Act, that the Crime of compafting and imagining the Death of any white Person, by any Slave or Slaves, should be deemed and adjudged a Crime of ashigh a Nature as the Crime of Murder, and should be punished as such, and was excepted, or meant to be excepted, fvithin the said Proviso.

II. And whereas a Conspiracy has been lately formed by several Slaves in this Island, to destroy and desert the Settlements and Plantations to which they belonged, and to murder their Masters, Mistresses, Overseers, and many Families of white Persons; and that there is Room to apprehend that a general Massacre of the white People was intended, in case the Conspirators had succeeded in their first Attempts; and whereas in this, and in every Cafe of the like Nature, it may be necessary, for the publick Peace and Safety, that more than one of the Conspirators should suffer Death, and that none of them, especially the Leaders, should remain in this Island, where they would preserve their bloody and rebellious Spirits; be it therefore further enacted and declared, That if any Negroe or other Slave or Slaves have, before the making of this Act, been engaged in any rebellious Conspiracy, or have compassed and imagined the Death of any white Person or Persons in this Island, or shall hereafter be engaged in any such Conspira-racy, or shall compass and imagine the Death of any white Person, and be

ima in‘n the thereof attainted by open Deed, before Twojustices of the Peace and Three Free-De2hofSa e holders, every such Slave or Slaves shall suffer Death, Transportation, or any white Person, other Punishment which the said Justices and Freeholders, or the major Part of them, in the same Manner as is directed by the said recited Act, shall think necessary for the publick Welfare and Safety, although the bloody Purposes of such Slave or Slaves be prevented before any Murder hath been or shall be committed; any thing in the said Proviso to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

III. And whereas Slaves have been tried, before the making of this Aid, for compafting and imagining the Death of White Persons, pursuant to the said Abl for the better Order and Government of Slaves; and the Justices and Freeholders have given Sentence of Death against more Slaves than one, for one and the fame Offence, and have ordered others to be transported, and the said Slaves have been executed and transported accordingly; it is hereby enacted and declared, That the said Trials, Sentences, Executions, and Proceedings were and are just and legal.

Whereas doubts have arisen whether, as the law now Hands, manumissions executed in this Island, where both parties reside, and the fame have been recorded in Tobago, Nevis, Antigua, and other Islands, are valid and effectual; and as many persons are now reputed free by virtue of such manumissions, it is reasonable that the law respecting them be declared and understood; be it therefore further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all manumissions executed in this Government before the operation of this Act, and recorded in any of the said Islands, although both parties reside within this government, shall be valid to every intent and purpose whatever.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in order to remove any doubt which may arise as to the legality or propriety of punishing the owner or director of any slave for any cruel conduct, towards such slave, it is hereby expressly declared and enacted, That if any person shall cruelly or wantonly whip, maltreat, beat, or imprison or keep in confinement without sufficient support, any slave under his or her direction or care, such person shall be indicted for the fame at the court of sessions, and upon being legally convicted thereof shall suffer such punishment by fine or imprisonpient, or both, as the judges-or justices of the said court shall think proper to inflict; and the said judges or justices are hereby authorized, if they shall deem it necessary for the further protection of the said slave, to order the marshal or his deputy to sell and dispose of such slave to any person, except the owner, at public outcry, and at the bed price that can be produced for such slave; and the monies arising from such fate, after payment of the fees, shall be paid to the person having the first lien thereon; and in case of no such prior lien, then to the owners of the said slave; and that such slave shall not directly or indirectly become the property of the former owner.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person shall beat or maltreat any slave not belonging to herself or himself, such offender shall not only be indicted and punished for the fame in like manner as mentioned in the preceding clause, but any punishment inflicted by the court of sessions for such offenc6 shall not be considered as a bar to any action or suit at law which may be commenced by the owner of such slave, or be considered in mitigation of any damages which may otherwise be given or recovered for such trespass or injury.

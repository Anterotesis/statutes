N° 36. An Act to restrain the Insolence of Slaves, and for preventing them from committing any Outrages, as also the better ordering such Slaves, &c.

WHEREAS it is notorious, that the Negroes not only commit grievous Outrages upon the Inhabitants by stealing and carrying away their Cattle, and other Stock raised for their Subsistence, but are likewise in many Places of this Island got together in such Numbers as to threaten the Disturbance of the Peace and Quiet of the same; we therefore pray their Majesties that it may be enacted, and it is hereby enacted by the Authority aforesaid,

[Negroes stealing to the Value of 12d. to suffer Death:]

That henceforward, where any Negro shall be taken stealing or carrying away Stock, Cattle, or Provision amounting, to the Value of Twelve Pence, such Negro or Negroes taken therein, shall, upon due Proof thereof before the Governor and Council, suffer such Death as they shall think fit to award;

[Or under that Value, Whipping.]

and when any Negro shall have any Theft proved against him, and the Value not amounting to Twelve Pence current Money of this Island, that then, and in such Cases, such Negro shall only suffer a severe Whipping, and have both his Ears cut off for the first Time,

[Second Offence, Death. (This Sum is altered by a subsequent Act passed in 1714-15.)]

but for the second Offence in the like Nature shall suffer Death in the Form aforesaid, the Public paying the Owner for every Negro put to Death the Sum of Three Thousand Five Hundred Pounds of Muscovado Sugar.

II. And forasmuch, through the Negroes Healing and destroying poor Peoples Provisions, they are quite discouraged from planting what they expect not to reap, be it moreover enabled and provided,

[Negroes may be shot stealing Provisions above 40 Foot from the Path.]

That it shall and may be lawful for any Person to shoot at, and if possible to kill any Negro he shall find digging out, drawing, or stealing his Provision, provided such Provision be not within Forty Foot of the common Path, and

The LAWS of MONTSERRAT. 17. 1693.

that the Party so killing the Negro hath not, in the Hearing of others, expressed either Hatred or Malice against the Owner of such Negro, for in either Cases the Owner of such shall recover Damages to the full Value of any who shall so kill their Negro.

III. And since by the often and frequent Meeting of the Negroes on the Lord’s Day, most of the Mischiefs which happen are then by them plotted and contrived; and seeing Masters, Mistresses, and Overseers are very negligent in their several Plantations, be it therefore further enacted and ordained,

[No Negroes to leave their Plantations on a Sunday without a Ticket.]

That no Person whatsoever, being Owners or Overseers, give Leave to any Negro Slave under their Ownership or Charge, to depart or leave their Plantations on the Sunday without a Ticket, expressing his or their Business, and whither going, upon Penalty of Three Hundred Pounds of Sugar, and having their Negroes severally whipped by the Owner or Owners of such Plantations where they shall be found or taken without a Ticket;

[Penalty on not enforcing this Law.]

and any Owner of a Plantation or Overseer, who shall neglect to punish as aforesaid any Negro without a Ticket being found in his Plantation, or under his Care or Charge, shall forfeit the Sum of Three Hundred Pounds of Sugar.

IV.

An Act for the further Restriction of Slaves, by prohibiting 112> them from planting any Indigo, Cotton, Ginger, Co fee, or Cocoa; and from keeping a public Market on Sundays; and for further refraining licentious Meetings of Negroes.

WHEREAS it appears that the Laws now in Force relating to

Negroes and Slaves, are not extensive enough to restrain them;

and that Lenity and Indulgence, instead of producing the defiled Effects,

have rather given Encouragement to Robberies and Dilorders, by fur-

nishing Pretences, whereby the Offenders often escape Punishment: And whereas the Labour and Industry of many of the poorer Sort of People

+of this Island is defeated by the Thefts of Slaves, who, under Colour of planting Indigo, Cotton, Ginger, Coffee, and Cocoa, for their own Use, do often steal the said Commodities, to the great Loss and Detriment of the Planters thereof: And whereas the said Commodities, or any stolen Goods or Provisions, may easily be disposed of, without the Knowledge of the Owners, at the public Market, which Slaves have been suffered to keep on the Lord’s Day, whereon great Numbers of them assemble in

and about the Towns of Plymouth and Kinfale, and other Parts of the

Island, frequently committing Riots and Disorders, to the great Terror

and aftiual endangering of the Inhabitants: For the preventing therefore,

as far as may be, such Abuses for the future, we. Your Majesty's most

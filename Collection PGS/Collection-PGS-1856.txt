General Board of Health.

Whereas, upon the petition of not less than one tenth of the inhabitants rated to the relief of the poor of and within the townships of Great Crosby and Litherland, in the parish of Sefton and county palatine of Lancaster, the General Board of Health appointed for the purposes of the Public Health Act, 1848, have, in pursuance of the provisions of that Act, directed Robert Rawlinson, a Superintending Inspector, appointed for the purposes of the said Act, to visit the said townships, within and throughout the boundaries thereof, and to make public inquiry, and to examine witnesses as to the sewerage, drainage, and supply of water, the state of the burial-grounds, the number and sanitary condition of the inhabitants, and as to any Local Acts of Parliament in force within the said townships for paving, lighting, clfiansing, watching, regulating, supplying with water, or improving the said townships, or having relation to the purposes of the said Act; also, as to the natural drainage areas, and the existing municipal, parochial, or other local boundaries, and the boundaries which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, having previously given the notices directed by the said Act, proceeded upon the said inquiry, and hath reported in writing to the said General Board upon the several matters with respect to which he was directed to inquire, and upon certain other matters in respect of which he deemed it expedient to report for the purposes of that Act.

Andrwhereas it appears to the General Board of Health, appointed for the purposes of the said Act, that the boundaries of the said District, as determined by the said Order, shall be altered, in the manner prescribed by the said Act.

And whereas the said General Board have, in pursuance of the provisions of the said Act, directed William Ranger, a Superintending Inspector appointed for the purposes of the said Act, to visit the said District, and to make further public inquiry, and to examine witnesses as to the alteration of the said boundaries.

An Act to amend and re-enact certain Provisions of an Act of the Fifty-fourth Year of King George the Third, relating to Judicial Procedure and Securities for Debts in Scotland. [29th July 1856.]

WHEREAS a Bill has been brought into Parliament, intituled A Bill to consolidate ' " * and amend the Laws of Scotland regarding Insolvency and Bankruptcy, by which it is

' proposed to repeal the Act passed in the Fifty-fourth Year of the Reign of His Majesty ' King George the Third, Chapter One hundred and thirty-seven, and it is expedient that c certain Provisions therein contained relating to Judicial Procedure and Securities for Debts in Scotland should be amended and re-enacted:' Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

I. An Arrestment executed to attach the Effects of a Debtor, as in the Hands of a Person out of Scotland, shall not be held to have interpelled such Person from paying to the original Creditor, unless Proof be made that he, or those having Authority to act for him, were previously in the Knowledge of such AiTestmeut having been so used.

II. The Court of Session shall have full Power to make Acts of Sederunt for abridging the Forms of Publication and Citation, and regulating the Proceedings in Processes of Sale, Ranking, and Division, whether at the Instance of Creditors or of apparent Heirs; and in every Case of a Sale under the Authority of the Court of Session it shall be lawful for the Purchaser, at any Term of Whitsunday or Martinmas subsequent to the Term of Payment of the Price, to lodge the Price, with the Interest due upon it, in any Joint Stock Bank of Issue in Scotland, at such Interest as can be procured for it, by doing which, and by giving Notice thereof to the Agent who carried on the Sale, he shall be discharged of the said Price * and

further.

411

19* & 20* VICTORIA c.91.

further, the Court of Session, upon the Application of any of the Creditors, shall be empowered to make an Order on the Purchaser to lodge the Price and Interest, at any of the said Terms subsequent to the Term of Payment, in one or other of the said Banks, sufficient Intimation being always previously given, both to the Purchaser and to the common Agent for the Creditors, that such Application is made, in order that all Parties may have an Opportunity to object; and in all Cases of Judicial Sales the Lands or other Heritable Property may be Sales may brought to actual Sale, so soon as the necessary previous Steps are taken, whether the F0** Bank-Ranking be concluded or not, unless the Court, upon Application of any Party concerned, g' shall find sufficient Cause to delay the Sale.

III. 4 And whereas Doubts have arisen upon the Construction of an Act of the Parliament What Proof 4 of Scotland passed in the Year One thousand six hundred and ninety, Chapter Twenty, of Insolvency 4 intituled Act anent the Sale of Bankrupts Landst in so far as it requires that the common or

4 Debtor be found bankrupt and utterly insolvent Be it enacted, That a Judioial Sale at Ae Instance of Creditors may in all Cases proceed where the Interest of the Debts and the other annual Burdens exceed the yearly Income of the Property under Sale, or where a Sequestration shall have taken place, without other Proof of Bankruptcy or Insolvency.

IY. When the Estate of a Debtor is brought into the Court of Session by Process of Decree of Judicial Sale and Ranking, the Decree of Sale to be pronounced by the Court shall be held as a General Decree of Adjudication in favour of every Creditor who shall afterwards be decree of included in the Decree of Division; and the Effect of such General Decree shall be the Adjudication Same in all Competitions, or Questions of Ranking and Preference, as if it had been pronounced and extracted of the Date of the First Calling of the Process of Sale before the Lord Ordinary in the Outer House, and no separate Adjudication shall be allowed to proceed during the Dependence of a Judicial Sale, and the Court is hereby authorized to settle, by an Act or Acts of Sederunt, in what Manner and at what Period or Periods the Principal Sums and bygone Interests of the Debts shall be accumulated, so as to do equal Justice to all concerned: Provided that it shall be competent to any Creditor who is in a Situation to adjudge to carry on the Action of Sale to its Conclusion, although deserted or abandoned by the original Pursuer.

V. And in order to lessen the Number of Adjudications for Debt, and the Expense to all Different Parties, and to facilitate the pari passu Preference of Creditors in similar Circumstances, be it enacted. That the Lord Ordinary officiating in the Court of Session before whom the First One Adjudica-Process of Adjudication against any Estate for Payment or Security of Debt is called shall tion. ordain intimation thereof to be made in the Minute Book and on the Wall, in order that any other Creditors of the Common Debtor who at the next Calling of the Cause can show tiytt, although they have not executed their Summonses of Adjudication, they are in other respects, by the Nature of the Grounds of Debt and Steps taken by them, in Condition to proceed in adjudging the common Debtor's Estate, may produce the Instructions of their Debts, with Summonses of Adjudication, libelled and signetted, for the Purpose of their being conjoined in the Decree of Adjudication, Twenty Sederunt Days being allowed for such Intimation before the Cause can be called a Second Time; and if any of those Forms shall happen to be omitted, such Adjudication shall be null and void, without Prejudice to its being brought forward again in more due Form, or still conjoined with any after Adjudication; and without Prejudice to the Validity and Order of ranking of posterior Adjudications, according to the Rules of Law, when any after Process or Processes of Adjudication are brought into Court, the same shall be regulated as to the Time and Manner of proceeding in them, by an Act or Acts of Sederunt of the Court of Session, so as to provide, as far as Circumstances will admit, for the pari passu Preference of such posterior Adjudications with one another, and to abridge the Number and Expense of such Proceedings; and in all Cases where Penalties for Nonpayment, over and above Performance, are contained in Bonds or other Obligations for Sums of Money, and are made the Subject of Adjudication, or of Demand in any other Shape, it shall be in the Power of the Court to modify and restrict such Penalties, so as not to exceed the real and necessary Expenses incurred in making the Debt effectual.

VI. And in order to fix more clearly in Time coming what Diligence is necessary to make Mode of ren-an Adjudication effectual, be it enacted. That the lodging of a Draft Charter and Note in the Office of the Presenter of Signatures, in Terms of the Act passed in the Tenth and Eleventh effectual? °n

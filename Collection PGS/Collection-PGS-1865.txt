An Act passed in the thirty-fifth year of the reign of King George the Third, intituled " An Act for paving the footways, and for cleansing, lighting, watching, and regulating " the streets, lanes, passages, and places, within the Borough of Wallingford in the " County of Berks, and for removing and preventing nuisances, annoyances, encroach-" ments, and obstructions therein."

And whereas, in pursuance of the said Local Government Act, inquiry has been made in the said District in respect of the matters mentioned in the said Petition, by Robert Morgan, Esquire, the Inspector appointed for that purpose.

And whereas it appears expedient to issue a Provisional Order in relation to the said matters, but no such Older can be valid without the confirmation of Parliament

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the powers vested in me by the said Local Government Act, I, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do, by this Provisional Order, under my hand, direct that from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this Order,—

LLANGOLLEN.

Provisional Order for extending the Borrowing Powers of the Llangollen Local Board. Whereas the Local Board for the District of Llangollen in the County of Denbigh have received the sanction of the Secretary of State to borrow, under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1858, sums, amounting in the whole to 4,562/. 10$., to defray the expense of works in the said District, being works of a permanent nature under the aforesaid Act; and whereas a further sum will be required to carry out and complete the said works, and to carry out other works of a permanent nature, but such further sum, with the hereinbefore mentioned 4,562/. 10$., will exceed the assessable value for one year of the premises assessable under the said Act within such District

And whereas the said Board have now, under the authority of the 78th section of the Local Government Act, 1858, petitioned me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, for powers to re-borrow the said sum of 4,562/. 10$., and to borrow any further sum on mortgage of the rates leviable by the aforesaid Local Board under the powers of the Local Government Act, 1858, the said two sums not exceeding in the whole two years' assessable value of the premises assessable within the District in respect of which such sum or sums may be borrowed.

And whereas after due inquiry and report by Robert Morgan, Esquire, the Inspector appointed by me for the purpose, I am of opinion that the prayer of such Petition should be granted; but the same cannot be done without the consent of Parliament.

WHEREAS, although there is only One Commission of the Peace for the whole ' " County of Sussex, the County has for Convenience been long treated as divided for ' the Purposes of the Transaction of the public Business of the County and the Adminis- tration of Justice at Quarter Sessions into the Eastern Division and the Western Division; ' and it is expedient that legal Validity be given to such Division for those Purposes, both * as to the past and as to the future:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the Bame, as follows:

L Subject to the Provisions of this Act, the Eastern Division and the Western Division of the County of Sussex shall each be and be deemed to have been a County of itself in relation to the Matters and Business following, namely,—in relation to the several Matters specified in the First Schedule to this Act, whether arising under or regulated by the several Enactments therein specified, or under or by any other Enactments for the Time being in force, and in relation to all Matters whatever arising under or regulated by any of the Enactments in the same Schedule specified,—and in relation to all Expenditure required or permitted by any of those Enactments or by any other Enactments for the Time being in force to be made out of County Rates or Rates in the Nature of County Rates,—and in relation to all Business connected with any of the Matters in the present Section mentioned as far as the same relate to either Division separately; and the Justices of the Peace for the County, sitting in Quarter Sessions for the County in each Division thereof, shall have and be deemed to have had the like Powers and Authorities to transact such Business in and for each Division separately, as if each Division was and had been a whole County of itself with a Commission of the Peace for such whole County.

2. Nothing in this Act shall make a Division of the County of Sussex a County of itself in relation to any of the several Matters specified in the Second Schedule to this Act, whether arising under or regulated by any of the several Enactments therein specified, or

3. Nothing in the Act of the Session of the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Years of Her Majesty's Reign (Chapter Thirty-three), " for the better Management of County Rates," shall apply or be deemed to have applied to the County of Sussex.

4. Where any Enactment, passed after the passing of this Act, has reference to Divisions of a County, then, subject to the Provisions of this Act, (unless a contrary Intention appears,) the Divisions of the County of Sussex shall be deemed Divisions within the Meaning of such Enactment, and every such Enactment shall extend and apply to the Divisions of the County of Sussex as if they had separate Commissions of the Peace.

5. Every Court held or to be held in either Division of the County of Sussex, purporting to be a Court of Quarter Sessions for the County, and begun to be held in that Division within the Time allowed by Law for the holding of Quarter Sessions for the County, but after the Conclusion of the Business of the Court of Quarter Sessions for the County sitting in the other Division, shall for all Purposes be deemed to have been or to be the Court of Quarter Sessions for the County duly continued by Adjournment from the Court of Quarter Sessions for the County which before sat in the other Division, and that whether the Adjournment of the Court from a Place in the one Division to a Place in the other Division was or is actually made or not, or was or is recorded or not.

6. It shall be and be deemed to have been lawful for Justices of the Peace for the County of Sussex, in the Manner heretofore used, to issue their Precept from Time to Time to the Sheriff of the County, to summon Men of the Body of One Division of the County to serve as Jurors at a Court of Quarter Sessions, original or adjourned, to be held in that Division, and to cause such Precept to relate in all respects to One Division only of the County, as if the Division was and had been a County of itself, and for all Sheriffs, Constables, Officers, and Persons to act under a Precept so framed.

7. With respect to any Notice required to be given by One Party to another relative to any Appeal or other Matter to be heard and determined by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace for the County of Sussex, the First Day of Sessions shall be deemed to be the Day on which the Court of Quarter Sessions for the County begins to be held in that Division wherein the Appeal or other Matter is heard and determined.

8. Nothing in this Act shall interfere with the Power of the Justices of the Peace for the County of Sussex to hold a Court of General Sessions of the Peace for the County; and a Special Court of General Sessions may be summoned and held as hereafter in this Act provided.

9. If at any Time Two or more Justices of the Peace for the County of Sussex deliver to the Clerk of the Peace for the County or his Deputy a Requisition in Writing under their Hands and Seals for the summoning and holding of a Special Court of General Sessions for the County under this Act, stating the Business which they desire to be brought before the Court, and the Time and Place at which the Court is to be held (the Time being not less than Twenty-one Days after the Delivery of the Requisition, and the Place being within the County), the Clerk of the Peace shall, as soon as may be, and within Seven Days after the Delivery to him of the Requisition, publish the same, with a Notice that a Court will be held accordingly, by Advertisement inserted in Two Newspapers usually circulating in the County of Sussex.

10. A Special Court of General Sessions of the Peace for the County of Sussex shall be held in accordance with such Requisition; and Nine Justices shall be a Quorum thereof;

4. —All expenses under the said Act shall be borne by the rates leviable in the said

District under the said Local Government Act, as if the purposes for which such expenses were incurred were purposes of the said Local Government Act

Fixed Engines.

39. "Fixed Engine" shall in this Act and the Salmon Fishery Act, 1861, include any Net or other Implement for taking Fish fixed to the Soil, or made stationary in any other Way, not being a Fishing Weir or Fishing Mill Dam: * And whereas by the Eleventh ' Section of the Salmon Fishery Act, 1861, it is provided that the said Section shall not affect any ancient Right or Mode of fishing as exercised at the Time of the passing of the ' Act by virtue of any Grant or Charter or immemorial UsageBe it enacted, That the said Provisions shall extend to exempt from the said Eleventh Section such fixed Engines only as were in use for catching Salmon during the Open Season of One thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, in pursuance of an ancient Right or Mode of fishing as lawfully exercised during such Open Season, by virtue of any Grant or Charter or immemorial Usage, which last-mentioned fixed Engines are herein-after referred to as privileged fixed Engines. But inasmuch as in certain Cases fixed Engines in use during the Four Years previous to 1861, or One of such Years, may from temporary Causes have been out of use during the Year 1861, and it is expedient to provide for such Cases, it is hereby declared, that if it is proved to the Satisfaction of the Special Commissioners appointed under this Act that any fixed Engine not in use during the Open Season of 1861 was in use during One of the said Four Years, Proof of its User during One of such Four Years may be substituted for Proof of its User during the Open Season of 1861; so, nevertheless, that no Person shall by proving the Use of different fixed Engines during the said Years be allowed to be entitled to a Number of privileged Engines exceeding the greatest Number of such Engines in use by him during some One of the Years 1857, 1858, 1859, 1860, 1861.

40. Subject to such Appeal as is herein-after mentioned, the Special Commissioners appointed under this Act, herein-after referred to as the Commissioners, may inquire into the Legality of all fixed Engines erected or used for catching Salmon within the Limits of the Salmon Fishery Acts, 1861 and 1865, and abate and remove all such as are not proved to their Satisfaction to be privileged.

41. Where a Claim is made by any Person on behalf of a fixed Engine that it is privileged, the Commissioners shall, on Proof being given to their Satisfaction that such Engine is privileged, certify to that Effect, stating in the Certificate the Situation, Size, and Description of the Engine. A Certificate given in pursuance of this Section shall be deemed to be an Order of the Commissioners, and to be subject to Appeal as such. If unappealed from, or as confirmed or amended on Appeal, such Certificate shall be conclusive Evidence that the Engine is a privileged Engine within the Meaning of the Salmon Fishery Acts, 1861 and 1865, but the Certificate shall not render any Engine legal that would be otherwise illegal by reason of its being injurious to Navigation.

42. Subject to such Appeal as is herein-after mentioned, the Commissioners may inquire into the Legality of all Fishing Weirs and Fishing Mill Dams throughout the Limits of the Salmon Fishery Acts, 1861 and 1865, and shall remove such Fishing Weirs, and cause to be rendered incapable of catching Fish such Fishing Mill Dams as are in contravention of the Salmon Fishery Act, 1861; provided that where a Fishing Weir is illegal only by reason of its not having a Free Gap as required by Law, or a Fishing Mill Dam is illegal only by reason of its not having a Fishing Pass attached thereto as required by Law, this Section shall not empower the Commissioners to remove such Fishing Weir if an Undertaking be entered into, to the Satisfaction of the Commissioners, by the Owner or other Person interested in such Weir, to make a legal Free Gap therein within a reasonable Time to be prescribed by the Commissioners, and a Free Gap is made accordingly, or to cause to be rendered incapable of catching Fish such Fishing Mill Dam if a like U ndertaking be entered into to attach a Fish Pass thereto, as required by Law, within a reasonable Time to be prescribed by the Commissioners, and such Fish Pass be attached accordingly.

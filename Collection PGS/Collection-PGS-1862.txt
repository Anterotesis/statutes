Whereas the Public Health Act, 1848, has been duly applied to the area comprised within the boundaries of the Town of Stroud, in the County of Gloucester, as defined in the second section of the Local Act of 6 Geo. 4. c. 6 .; and, under the provisions of the Public Health Supplemental Act, 1857, 20 Vict. cap. 3., the Commissioners for the time being acting in execution of the said Local Act for paving, lighting, watching, cleansing," regulating, and improving the town of Stroud, in the county of Gloucester," were appointed the Local Board of Health under the said Public Health Act.

And whereas the powers, authorities, and duties of the said Commissioners ceased from and after the passing of the aforesaid Public Health Supplemental Act, 1857, and were transferred to the said Local Board of Health, to be exercised as if they had been granted or imposed by the said Public Health Act; and all property and estate of the Commissioners acting in the execution of the said Local Act were also transferred to the said Local Board of Health, and all debts, monies, and securities for money contracted or payable, or to become payable by such Commissioners, were thenceforth to be satisfied by the said Local Board,

And whereas the said Commissioners had duly raised under the authority of their Local Act, sums of which Two thousand nine hundred pounds still remain due and payable; and the said Local Board of Health have since the passing of the aforesaid Public Health Supplemental Act, 1857, received sanction under the Local Government Act, 1858, and the Public Health Act, 1848, to borrow upon security of the rates of the aforesaid District of Stroud, sums amounting in the whole to Thirteen thousand five hundred pounds to defray

the

the expense of Works for the Drainage of nd Supply of Water to the said District, and other Works of a permanent nature under the aforesaid Acts; and whereas a further sum of One thousand six hundred pounds will be required to carry out and complete the said works and to carry out other works of a permanent nature, but such further sum, with the first herein-before mentioned sums, will exceed the assessable value for one year of the premises assessable under the said Acts within such District.

And whereas the said Board have now, under the authority of the 78th Section of the Local Government Act, 1858, petitioned me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, for powers to borrow for such works, on mortgage of the rates leviable by the aforesaid Local Board of Health under the powers of the Public Health Act, 1848, and the Local Government Act, 1858, a sum not exceeding One thousand six hundred pounds beyond the sums herein-before mentioned, and making altogether an amount not exceeding Eighteen thousand pounds.

And whereas after due inquiry and report by Robert Rawlinson, Esquire, the Inspector appointed by me for the purpose, I am of opinion that the prayer of such Petition should be granted; but the same cannot be done without the consent of Parliament.

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the power now vested in me as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, as aforesaid, I do hereby* by this Provisional Order, under my Hand, direct as follows: —

That, from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this present Order, —

Whereas the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the Borough of Ipswich, in the County of Suffolk, being the Local Board of Health in and for the District of the said Borough, have, in pursuance of the Provisions of the 7oth Section of the Local Government Act, 1858, and after complying with the requirements of that Section by duly giving and serving all notices thereby directed, presented a Petition, under their Common Seal, to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, for authority to put in force the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, to enable the aforesaid Local Board of Health to purchase certain pieces of land and certain buildings for the purpose of enabling them to alter and improve the street called King's Street in the said Borough.

And whereas the said Petition duly set forth the several pieces of land and the several buildings intended to be taken by such Board for such purposes, and the names of the owners, lessees, and occupiers of the aforesaid land and buildings who have assented, dissented, or are neuter in respect of the taking thereof, or who have returned no answer to the notice issued by such Board; and such Petition prayed that the said Board might, with reference to such land and buildings, be allowed to put in force the powers of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act aforesaid, with respect to the purchase and taking oft lands otherwise than by agreement; and on the receipt of such Petition, Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department directed William Ranger, Esquire, the Inspector appointed for the purpose, to visit the said District, and the said Inspector has now inquired in the District aforesaid into the subject matter of such Petition, and has duly reported thereon.

Now, therefore, I, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do hereby in pursuance of the powers vested in me by the Local Government Act, 1858, make Order and direct, —

That, from and after the passing of any Act of Rurliament confirming this Order —

Provisional Order repealing a Local Act in force within the District of the Sandown Local Board. — Local Government Act, 1858.

Whereas the Local Board for the District of Sandown, in the Isle of Wight, in which District the Local Government Act, 1858, has been duly adopted, have, in pursuance of the said Act, presented a Petition to the Right Honourable Sir George Grey, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, praying for the repeal of a certain Local Act of Parliament in force within the Isle of Wight aforesaid, so far as such Act affects the said District of Sandown, the said Act having relation to the purposes of the said Local Government Act, and not conferring powers or privileges upon any corporation, company, undertakers, or individuals for their own pecuniary benefit; that is to say,

And whereas, in pursuance of the said Local Government Act, inquiry has been made in the said District in respect of the several matters mentioned in the said Petition.

And whereas it appears expedient to issue a Provisional Order in relation to the said matters, but no such order can be valid without the confirmation of Parliament.

An Act to appropriate certain Portions of Land lying between High and Low Water Mark, situate in the Parishes of Shoebury and Wakering in the County of Essex, as Ranges for the Use and Practice of Artillery.

[17th July 1862.]

WHEREAS certain Lands in the Parish of Shoebury in the County of Essex have been purchased in Fee, and certain other Lands therein and in the Parish of

4 Wahering in the same County have been acquired for certain Terms of Years under the Defence Act, 1842," and the "Ordnance Board Transfer Act, 1855," and are now vested in and possessed by Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the War ' Department in trust for Her Majesty, the Particulars of which Premises and of his Estate and Interest therein are mentioned and set forth in the Schedule to this Act, and are shown and delineated on the Map or Plan made thereof and to be deposited with the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty: And whereas the said Lands and Premises have ' been used and appropriated for the Establishment of a School of Gunnery and the Practice of Artillery, and large Sums of Money have been expended in the Erection of Barracks and Quarters for Officers and Soldiers at Shoebury aforesaid: And whereas it is alleged that Portion of the Lands and Premises which lies between High and Low 4 Water Mark is subject to the Rights of Passage and Anchorage of Vessels in the Water or Sea flowing over the same, and at Low Water to certain other Rights of Grounding thereon: And whereas such alleged Rights, if suffered to continue, would very much interfere with and impede the useful Purposes intended to be effected by the Acquisition of the said Lands and Premises and by the Establishment of the* School of Gunnery aforesaid, and would be highly detrimental to the Public Service; and for the Reasons aforesaid it is expedient that the same should be forthwith partially extinguished and the said Premises be kept free from all the Anchorage or Grounding of Vessels, Barges, and other Craft:* Be it therefore enacted by the Queens most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

L So long as the Lands and Premises mentioned in the Schedule to this Act shall remain vested in or be possessed by Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the War Department in trust as aforesaid, he shall from Time to Time, as Occasion may require, cause to be marked out and distinguished by Buoys, or other sufficient Marks to 25 & 26 Vict.

be erected or fixed upon the said Lands and Premises, such Spaces or Distances thereon as he may judge necessary to be kept free from all Anchorage or Grounding of Vessels of any Band, and to order and direct that the several Spaces or Distances so marked out and distinguished shall be and remain as Ranges for Artillery Practice, freed from all Rights of Anchorage or Grounding thereon.

2. Whenever the said Principal Secretary shall have marked out and appropriated any Spaces or Distances for Ranges as aforesaid, all Rights (if any) of Anchorage and Grounding over or upon the same shall absolutely cease and determine, and a Notification thereof shall be made to the Lords of the Admiralty, and be published in the London Gazette, and by Advertisement in some Morning Newspaper and in some local Newspaper circulated in the said County of Essex, and by affixing the same on the Church Doors of the said several Parishes aforesaid.

3. If any Vessel, Barge, or other Craft, unless forced to remain thereon by Stress of Weather or other unavoidable Accident, shall anchor or ground upon any Range marked out in pursuance of this Act, then the Owner or Master of such Vessel, Barge, or other Craft, as the Case may be, shall on Conviction thereof before any Justice or Justices of the Peace forfeit and pay such a Sum, not less than Forty Shillings and not exceeding Five Pounds for every Offence, as may be awarded against him, and such Penalty, and also the reasonable Costs attending the Prosecution, shall be duly ascertained and awarded, and shall be enforced and recovered as any pecuniary Penalties may be recovered under the Provisions of an Act passed in the Twelfth Year of Her Majesty, intituled An Act to facilitate the Performance of the Duties of Justices of the Peace out of Sessions within England and Wales with respect to Summary Convictions and Orders.

4. Nothing in this Act contained shall be construed to prevent the Entry of the Lords or Ladies of the Manors of South Shoebury and Wakeriny, their respective Servants or Agents, upon the Beach or Shore for the Purpose of exercising their Manorial or other Rights thereon, and of recovering or removing therefrom all Wrecks of the Sea, Jetsam, Flotsam, and Lagan Goods, Merchandise, or Effects whatsoever, or from exercising any other Rights reserved to the Lords or Ladies or either of them in and by any Lease or Leases granted by or on behalf of them or either of them, or by any Conveyance or Assurance to the Secretary of State for the War Department: Provided always, that no Part of the Lands lying East and North of the Line marked A., B., and C. on the said Map or Plan shall ever be appropriated for any Range under the Provisions of this Act; and that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to repeal or alter any Enactments relating to Wreck, Jetsam, Flotsam, or Derelict contained in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, or in any Act amending the same,

5. This Act may be cited for all Purposes as "The Artillery Ranges Act, 1862."

26. Where a Waywarden or any Ratepayer of any Parish is of opinion that the Amount charged to his Parish for maintaining and keeping the Highways therein, or in respect of the other Expenses in relation to such Highways, is more than the Sum that has actually been expended in his Parish, or than ought to have been charged thereto, he may appeal to the Justices assembled at any Court of General or Quarter Sessions held within the Period of Four Months from the Time at which the Accounts were audited by the Board, but no such Appeal shall be entertained unless Notice of the Intention to appeal, specifying the Amount complained of, is given to the Board by the Appellant in Writing under his Hand within Fourteen Days after the Statement of such Accounts shall have been sent to the Overseers of such Parish.

On the Hearing of such Appeal the Court may rectify the Accounts complained of, and may also rectify the Sum to be contributed to the Common Fund, and calculated on the Expenditure complained of.

If the Appellant is successful the Costs shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be paid by the Board, and shall be charged to the Parishes within the Jurisdiction of the Board other than the Parish to which Appellant belongs, in the same Proportions in which such Parishes contribute to the Common Fund of the Board.

Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Majesty the King of Denmark, having judged it expedient, with a View to the better Administration of Justice, and to the Prevention of Crime within their respective Territories and Jurisdictions, that Persons charged with or convicted of the Crimes herein-after enumerated, and being Fugitives from Justice, should, under certain Circumstances, be reciprocally delivered up; their said Majesties have named as their Plenipotentiaries to conclude a Convention for this Purpose; that is to say,

Provided also, that in the Case of a Person accused, the Surrender shall be made only when the Commission of the Crime shall be so established as that the Laws of the Country where the Fugitive or Person so accused shall be found would justify his Apprehension and Commitment for Trial if the Crime had been there committed, and in the Case of a Person convicted, the Surrender shall be made only on the Production of an authenticated Copy of his Conviction and on Proof of his Identity.

Consequently, on the Part of the Danish Government, the Surrender shall be made only by the Consent of the Minister to whose Department appertains the Administration of Justice, and after the Production, in the Case of a Person accused, of a Warrant of Arrest or other equivalent Judicial Document issued by a Judge or other competent Authority in the United Kingdom, clearly setting forth the Acts for which the Fugitive shall have rendered himself accountable, or in the Case of a Person convicted, on the Production of an authenticated Copy of his Conviction and on Proof of his Identity.

On the Part of the British Government, the Surrender in the Case of a Person accused shall be made only on the Warrant or other equivalent Judicial Document for the Arresfc of a Fugitive, issued by a Judge or Magistrate duly authorized to take Cognizance of the Acts charged against the Fugitive in Denmark, and on duly authenticated Depositions or Statements on Oath before such Judge or Magistrate, clearly setting forth the said Acts, or on such other Evidence thereof as, according to the Laws of England, would warrant the Apprehension of the said Fugitive and his Committal for Trial for the said Acts, if they had been therein committed, or in the Case of a Person convicted, on the Production of an authenticated Copy of his Conviction and on Proof of his Identity.

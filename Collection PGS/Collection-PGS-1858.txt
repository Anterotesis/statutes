Numbers, 130, 135 Men.

WHEREAS the raising or keeping a Standing Army 4 within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Time of Peace, unless it be with the Consent of Parliament, is against Law: And whereas it is adjudged necessary by Her Majesty and this present Parliament that

subjected in Time of Peace to any Kind of Punishment

within this Realm, by Martial Law, or in any other Manner than by Judgment of his Peers, and according to the known and established Laws of this Realm; yet nevertheless it being requisite, for the retaining all the before-mentioned Forces in their Duty, that an exact Discipline be observed,

and that Soldiers who shall mutiny or stir up Sedition, or shall desert Her Majesty's Service, or be guilty of Crimes and Offences to the Prejudice of good Order and Military Discipline, be brought to a more exemplary and speedy Punishment than the usual Forms of the Law will allow Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual

Provisional Order for the Application of the Public Health Act to the District of Skipton in the West Riding of the County of York.

General Board of Health.

Whereas upon the petition of not less than one-tenth of the inhabitants rated to the relief of the poor of and within the Township of Skipton in the West Riding of the County of York, the General Board of Health, appointed for the purposes of the Public Health Act, 1848, have, in pursuance of the provisions of that Act, directed William Ranger, a Superintending Inspector, appointed for the purposes of the said Act, to visit the said Township, and to make public inquiry, and to examine witnesses as to the sewerage, drainage, and supply of water, the state of the burial-grounds, the number and sanitary condition of the inhabitants, and as to any Local Acts of Parliament in force within the said Township for paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, regulating, supplying with water, or improving the said Township, or having relation to the purposes of the said Act; also as to the natural drainage areas, and the existing municipal, parochial, or other local boundaries, and the boundary which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, having previously given the notices directed by the said Act, proceeded upon the said inquiry, and has reported in writing to the said

General

141

General Board of Health (Skipton, $<?.) Cap. 10.

General Board upon the several matters with respect to which he was directed to inquire, and upon certain other matters in respect of which he deemed it expedient to report for the purposes of that Act.

And whereas copies of the said Report, accompanied by a notice stating that written statements might be forwarded to the said Board with respect to any matter contained in or omitted from the said Report, or any amendment proposed to be made therein, have been duly published and deposited as directed by the said Public Health Act; and the time for forwarding such statements has now elapsed, and no such statements have been received by the said Board.

And whereas it having appeared to the said General Board that the boundary which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Act was not the same as that of the said Township with respect to which the said inquiry had been made, the said Board caused the aforesaid William Ranger to visit the parts within the boundary proposed to be adopted for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, after having given such notice as is required by the said Act, did hear all persons desirous of being heard before him on the subject of the said Report, and of the boundary proposed to be adopted for the purposes of the said Act; and did make further inquiry, and report according to the directions of the said Board.

And whereas copies of such further Report, accompanied by a notice stating that, within the time directed by the said Act, written statements might be forwarded to the said Board with respect to any matter contained in or omitted from the said Report, or any amendment proposed to be made therein, have been duly published and deposited as required by the said Act; and the time for forwarding such statements has now elapsed, and no such statements have been received by the said Board.

And whereas it appears upon such Reports that there is a certain Local Act of Parliament in force within the said Township having relation to the purposes of the said Public Health Act; that is to say,

An Act passed in the fourth year of the reign of King George the Fourth, intituled " An Act for better supplying with Water the Town of Skipton in the West " Riding of the County of York."

And whereas it appears to the said General Board to be expedient that the said Public Health Act should be applied to a district comprised within the boundary described in the Schedule to this Order annexed, and shown by the line described as " Proposed Boundary," on the map accompanying the said first printed Report to the General Board of Health, beaming date the 26th March 1857, and further described in the Appendix to the aforesaid Report (p. 23), but the same cannot be done without the authority of Parliament.

Now

referred to in the said Award are stated to contain in the

possessing Rights of Common within the Boundaries of the said late Forest are entitled to exercise them over all Commonable Lands within the Boundaries of such Forest, or only over such as lie in the same Parish or District as the Lands in respect of which such Rights are claimed: And whereas it is expedient that Provision should be made for setting out a 4 Part of the unallotted Portion of the King's Forest or King's 4 Woods to the Queen s Majesty and other the Persons entitled to Common of Estovers or Fuel Assignments, and for dividing and allotting such Part between them in satisfaction of their said Rights, and it is also expedient to ascertain and define the Commonable Lands within the Boundaries of the said late

\ADHERE AS an Act was passed in the Session of Parlia-

' ment holden in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Years

i of the Reign of Her present Majesty, Chapter Sixty-two, ' intituled An Act to provide for the Maintenance of Navigations

made in connexion with Drainage, and to make further Pro-

vision in relation to Works of Drainage in Ireland: And whereas it is by the said Act, amongst other things, provided,

that it should be lawful for the Commissioners of the Treasury, at any Time, and from Time to Time, within the first ' Two Years after the passing of the said Act, to direct that

certain Advances of Money should be made to the Trustees

of such Navigations respectively, to be applied for the

Purposes in the said Act mentioned: And whereas the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland have not yet made the final Award in respect to any of th6 said Navigations ' required to be made before such Money could be advanced, ' and it is expedient that the Time for making such Advances

should be extended:* Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

I. The Time by the said Act limited for enabling the Commissioners of the Treasury to direct Advances of Money to be made for the Purposes of the Navigations, or any of them, in the said Act mentioned, shall be extended to Two Years from the Date of the Awards to be made by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland in relation to the said Navigations respectively.

An Act to amend the Municipal Franchise in certain Cases.

[23d July 1858.]

WHEREAS by Section Nineteen of an Act passed in c the Session holden in the Fifty-ninth Year of His late Majesty King George the Third, Chapter Twelve, intituled

An Act to amend the Laws for the Relief of the Poor, the c Inhabitants of any Parish in Vestry assembled are empowered to resolve and direct that the Owner or Owners of all c Houses, Apartments, or Dwellings in such Parishes, being £ the immediate Lessor or Lessors of the actual Occupier or Occupiers, which shall respectively be let to the Occupiers c thereof at any Rent or Rate not exceeding Twenty Pounds nor less than Six Pounds by the Year, for any less Term c than One Year, or on any Agreement by which the Rent shall be reserved or made payable at any shorter Period than

Three Months, shall be assessed to the Rates for the Relief c of the Poor for or in respect of such Houses, Apartments, or c Dwellings, and the Outhouses and Curtilages thereof, instead of the actual Occupiers: And whereas it is doubtful whether in such Case such Occupier is entitled to any Municipal c' Privileges and Franchises to which, by virtue of an Act

passed in the Session of Parliament held in the Fifth and

Sixth Years of the Reign of King William the Fourth,

intituled An Act to provide for the Regulation of Municipal Corporations in England and Wales, he would have been entitled if he himself had been rated and had paid such Rate c or Rates: And whereas, when the Owner of any Tenement

is rated to the Relief of the Poor by virtue of an Act passed in the Session of Parliament held in the Thirteenth and

Fourteenth Years of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act c for the better assessing and collecting the Poor Rates and Highway Rates in respect of Small Tenements, instead of the

Occupier thereof, and has paid all Money due on account c of any Rate or Rates in respect of such Tenement, such

Occupier is entitled to all Municipal Privileges and Franchises to which by virtue of the said recited Act of King

William the Fourth he would have been entitled if he himself c had been rated and had paid such Rate or Rates \ Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

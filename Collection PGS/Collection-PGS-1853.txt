Provisional Order for the Application of the Public Health Act to the Borough of Wakefieldy

in the County of York,

General Board of Health.

Whereas, it having been ascertained from the last Return, for the time being, made up by the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, that the annual number of deaths within the boundaries of the Borough of Wakefield in the county of York, as the same were fixed for the purposes of an Act passed in the sixth year of the reign of King William the Fourth, intituled " An Act to provide for the Regulation of Municipal " Corporations in England and Wales," has on an average of seven years exceeded during that period the proportion of twenty-three to a thousand of the population of such Borough, the General Board of Health have, in pursuance of the provisions of that Act, directed William Ranger, a Superintending Inspector, appointed for the purposes of the said Act, to visit the said Borough, and to make public inquiry, and to examine witnesses as to the sewerage, drainage, and supply of water, the state of the burial-grounds, the number and sanitary condition of the inhabitants, and as to any Local Acts of Parliament in force within the said Borough, for paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, regulating, supplying with water, or improving the said Borough, or having relation to the purposes of the said Act; and also as to the natural drainage areas, and the existing municipal, parochial, or other local boundaries, and the boundaries which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Public Health Act.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, having previously given the notices directed by the said Act, proceeded upon the said inquiry, and hath reported in writing to the said General Board upon the several matters with respect to which he was directed to inquire, and upon certain other matters in respect of which he deemed it expedient to report for the purposes of that Act.

And whereas copies of the said Report, accompanied by a notice, stating that written statements might be forwarded to the said Board with respect to any matter contained in or omitted from the said Report, or any amendment proposed to be made therein, have been duly published and deposited as directed by the said Public Health Act, and the time for forwarding such statements has now elapsed, and all such statements as have been received by the said Board have been duly deposited as required by the Act.

And whereas it appears upon such Report that there are certain Local Acts of Parliament in force within the said Borough, having relation to the purposes of the said Public Health Act; (that is to say,)

An Act passed in the eleventh year of the reign of King George the Third, intituled (< An Act for the better paving, repairing, and cleansing the streets, lanes, alleys, " and other public passages within that part of the Town of Wakefield, in the " county of York, which lies within the east end of Westgate-bridge, the south " side of Northgate-bar, the north end of Kirkgate-bridge (except so much thereof " as is repaired by the West Riding of the said County of York), and the extreme " part of the Township of Wakefield aforesaid, leading from Wrengatc towards East " Moor; for preventing nuisances and annoyances therein, and for widening and ft rendering the same more commodiousand also another Act passed in the thirty-sixth year of the same reign, intituled " An Act for lighting and watching the streets " and other public passages and places within the Town of Wakefield, in the county " of York, and for more effectually cleansing the same, and removing and preventing " obstructions, nuisances, and annoyances therein."

And whereas from such Report it appears that, although the mortality of Wakefield is below that of some of the neighbouring towns, it is still excessive, and that the real cause of this excessive mortality is to be found in the generally defective nature of the existing sanitary arrangements; that certain localities contribute an undue proportion of the mortality of the whole Borough, and that in these quarters there is the least sewerage and drainage, the largest collection of offensive refuse, and the scantiest supply of water; that the unsatisfactory condition of the Borough in these respects may be accounted for by the defective nature of the Local Acts, and the divided jurisdiction exercised by the various public bodies; that this divided jurisdiction further causes unnecessary expense, and effectually prevents the carrying out of general and comprehensive measures; that the existing water supply requires re-adjustment and extension; that the present sewerage and drainage is much too limited in extent, and that where sewers or house drains are laid down, they are, in many cases, defective both in construction and arrangement; that the partial provisions made for either sewerage or house drains have been carried out at various periods and in various ways, instead of on a combined and carefully arranged system, by which alone due efficiency can be secured, and that the present outfalls for the sewage are also highly prejudicial to health; that the present system of cleansing the streets and removing the house refuse is imperfect; that the existing burial-grounds are insufficient, and some of them unfit to be longer used as places of interment; that many portions of the town are insufficiently lighted, particularly a great number of the courts and lanes occupied by the poorer classes; that it would be a means of health and comfort to all, but particularly the poorer classes of the Borough, if public baths and wash-houses were established.

And whereas it appears to the said General Board of Health to be expedient that the said Public Health Act, except as herein-after mentioned, should be applied to the said Borough; and that provision should be made with respect to the said Local Acts of Parliament, and the partial repeal, alteration, extension, and further execution thereof; but the same cannot be done without the authority of Parliament.

Now

DUDLEY.

Provisional Order for the Application of the Public Health Act, 1848, to the Parish of Dudley,

in the County of Worcester.

General Board of Health.

Whereas it having been ascertained from the last return for the time being, made up by the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, that the annual number of deaths within the boundaries of the Parish of Dudley has on the average of seven years exceeded the proportion of twenty-three to a thousand of the j>opulation of such Parish, the General Board of Health directed William Lee, one of their Superintending Inspectors, to visit the said Parish, and to make public inquiry, and to examine witnesses, as to the sewerage, drainage, and supply of water, the state of the burial grounds, the number and sanitary condition of the inhabitants, and as to any Local Acts of Parliament in force within the said Parish for paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, regulating, supplying with water, or improving the said Parish, or having relation to the purposes of the said Act; also, as to the natural drainage areas, and the existing parochial or other local boundaries, and the boundaries which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, having previously given the notices required by the said Act, proceeded upon the said inquiry in the manner directed by the said 16 Vict. ' T Act,

142

16" VICTORIA, c.24.

Act, and hath reported in writing to the said General Board upon the several matters with respect to which he was so directed to inquire as aforesaid, and upon certain other matters in respect of which he deemed it expedient to report for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas copies of the said Report, accompanied by a notice stating that, within the time directed by the said Act, written statements might be forwarded to the said Board with respect to any matter contained in or omitted from the said Report, or any amendment proposed to be made therein, have been duly published and deposited as required by the said Act, and the time for forwarding such statements has now elapsed, and no such statements have been received by the said Board.

And whereas it appears upon such Report that there is a certain Local Act in force within the said Parish having relation to the purposes of the said Public Health Act, that is to say. An Act passed in the Thirty-first Year of the Reign of King George the Third, intituled " An Act for paving, cleansing, lighting, watching, and otherwise improving the Town " of Dudley, in the County ot Worcester, and for better supplying the said Town with " Water."

And whereas from such Report it appears that the official registers show an excessive rate of mortality in the Parish, and that the health of the Parish would be much improved by proper supplies of water for domestic and sanitary purposes; by efficient drainage of houses and courts; by the abolition of open cesspools, and the substitution of soil-pan apparatus, with water for carrying oft' house refuse; by better paving and cleansing of streets, courts, and alleys; alid that such improvements rpav be carried out with great pecuniary saving to the inhabitants.

And whereas it appears to the said General Board to be expedient that the said Public Health Act should be applied to the said Parish, and that provision should be made in respect to the said Local Act of Parliament, and the repeal, alteration, extension, and future execution thereof, but the same cannot be done without the authority of Parliament.

Now therefore, in pursuance of the powers vested in the said Board by the Public Health Act, 1848, We, the said General Board of Health, do, by this Provisional Order under our hands and official seal, direct, That from and after the day appointed for the first election of the Local Board of Health by any Act of Parliament confirming this Order:—

5. —At the first election of the said Local Board, the Reverend James Caulfeild Browne,

D.C.L., Vicar of Dudley, shall perform the duties which it may be requisite for liim to perform in conducting the said first election; and in case the said James Caulfeild Browne, from illness or other sufficient cause, shall be unable to discharge such duties, or shall be absent, or shall refuse to act, then Joseph Green Bourne, Esq., solicitor, Dudley, shall perform such of the said duties as then remain to be performed.

G. —The fourteen days' notice of qualification required by the Public Health Act, 1848, to be given by owners of property in order to entitle them to vote at the said first election shall be given to the said James Caulfeild Browne, at his residence, the Vicarage, Dudley; or in case he shall refuse or be unable to receive the same, then to the aforesaid Joseph Green Bourne, at his residence, likewise within the district of Dudley aforesaid.

18. —Provided also, that this Order, and the repeal of the parts of the said Local Act

mentioned in the Schedule thereto, shall be without prejudice to any penalties incurred under that Act, but all such penalties may be recovered by the said Local Board of Health, according to the provisions of this Order.

DORCHESTER.

Provisional Order for the Application of the Public Health Act to the Borough of Dorchester,

in the County of Dorset.

General Board of Health.

Whereas, it having been ascertained from the last Return, for the time being, made up by the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, from the deaths registered in a period of not less than seven years, to wit, the period commencing the first day of September in the year of our Lord 1838 and ending on the thirty-first day of August in the year of our Lord 1844, that the number of deaths annually within the boundaries of the four parishes of All Saints, St. Peter, Holy Trinity, and Fordington, in the county of Dorset, within which is situate the borough of Dorchester, has on an average exceeded during that period the proportion of twenty-three to a thousand of the population of such Parishes, the General Board of Health have directed Robert Rawlinson, one of their Superintending Inspectors, to visit the said Parishes, and to make public inquiry, and to examine witnesses as to the sewerage, drainage, and supply of water, the state of the burial-grounds, the number and sanitary condition of the inhabitants, and as to any Local Acts of Parliament in force within the said Parishes, for paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, regulating, supplying with water, or improving the said Parishes, or having relation to the purposes of the said Act; and also as to the natural drainage areas, and the existing municipal, parochial, or other local boundaries, and the boundaries which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Public Health Act.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, having previously given the notices directed by the said Act, proceeded upon the said inquiry in the manner directed by the said Act, and hath reported in writing to the said General Board upon the several matters with respect to which he was directed to inquire, and upon certain other matters in respect of which he deemed it expedient to report for the purposes of that Act.

And whereas copies of the said Report, accompanied by a notice, stating that written statements might be forwarded to the said Board with respect to any matter contained in or omitted from the said Report, or any amendment proposed to be made therein, have been duly published and deposited as directed by the Public Health Act, and the time for forwarding

148

16° VICTORIA, c.24.

ing such statements lias now elapsed, and no such statements have been received by the said Board.

And whereas it having appeared to the said General Board that the boundaries which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Act were not the same as those of the said Town with respect to which the said inquiry had been made, the said Board caused the said Robert Rawlinson to visit the parts within the boundaries proposed to be adopted for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, after having given such notice as is required by the said Act, did hear all persons desirous of being heard before him on the subject of the said Report, and did make further inquiry and report according to the directions of the said Board.

And whereas copies of such further Report, accompanied by a notice stating that, within the time directed by the said Act, written statements might be forwarded to the said Board with respect to any matter contained in or omitted from the said Report, or any amendment proposed to be made therein, have been duly published and deposited as required by the said Act, and the time for forwarding such statements has now elapsed, and no such statements have been received by the said Board.

And whereas it appears upon such Report, and further Report, that there is a certain Local Act of Parliament in force within the said Parishes, having relation to the purposes of the said Public Health Act, (that is to say,)

An Act passed in the fourth year of the reign of King William the Fourth, intituled " An Act for better paving, cleansing, lighting, watching, watering, and otherwise " improving the streets and other public passages and places within the Borough " of Dorchester, in the county of Dorset, and the tithmg of Colliton-row, in the " town of Dorchester aforesaid."

And whereas the said Parishes wholly include the Municipal Borough of Dorchester, as the boundaries thereof were fixed for the purposes of an Act passed in the sixth year of the reign of King William the Fourth, intituled " An Act to provide for the Regulation of Municipal Corporations in England and Wales."

And whereas, on such Report and further Report, it appears that in the said Borough epidemic, endemic, and contagious diseases prevail, and the average mortality is excessive; that the local governing bodies of the borough are limited as to the area of their jurisdiction, and deficient as to power; that there is no proper system of sewers nor drains; that streets are unpaved and in a dirty condition; that lighting in the suburbs is not &o general as it ought to be for safety and comfort; that streets are confined, yards are without adequate means of ventilation, and that many of the houses and room-tenements inhabited by the poor are in a most neglected, wretched, and filthy condition; that immorality, dissipation, disease, and pauperism are the consequences; that there is a high rate of mortality; and that the cost to the ratepayers consequent upon such a state is excessive; that there are many middens crowded upon dwelling-houses, and even under sleeping-rooms; that the graveyards are unduly crowded; that better arrangements for paving, cleansing, and regulating the streets should be made; that more stringent regulations for the slaughtering of cattle and sheep will be an advantage; that power to close objectionable dwellings and room-tenements is needed, as also to regulate common lodging-houses; that power to erect baths, wash-houses, and model lodging-houses may be exercised for the general benefit of the ratepayers.

And whereas for all these reasons it appears to the said General Board of Health to be expedient that the said Public Health Act, except as herein-after mentioned, should be applied to the said Borough; and that provision should be made with respect to the said Local Act of Parliament, and the partial repeal, alteration, extension, and further execution thereof; but the same cannot be done without the authority of Parliament.

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the power vested in the said Board by the Public Health Act, 1848, we, the said General Board of Health, do, by this Provisional Order under our hands and seal of office, direct: —

That from the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this Order,—

1.—In the construction of this Order, and of the sections of the several Acts of Parliament incorporated therewith, the same meanings shall be assigned to certain expressions

149

16° VICTORIA c.24.

2. —So much of " The Public Health Act, 1848," as relates to corporate districts shall apply

to the area comprised within the boundaries of the said Borough of Dorchester.

3. —The Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the said Borough shall be by the Council of

the said Borough the Local Board of Health for the district hereby constituted.

4. —The parts of the said Local Act specified in the Schedule to this Order shall be

5. —The powers of the Commissioners for the time being acting in execution of the said

Local Act, and of their officers, shall cease; and such of them as are granted by the unrepealed parts of the said Local Act shall, so far as the same are not repugnant to, or inconsistent with, the said Public Health Act, or this Order, or any byelaw which shall be lawfully made under the said Public Health Act, be transferred to the said Local Board of Health, and such of the officers of the said Local Board as shall be appointed in that behalf under the said Public Health Act, and shall be exercised in the same manner, as nearly as may be, as if such powers had been granted by the said Public Health Act.

6. —The said Local Board shall be the Commissioners for executing the unrepealed parts

of the said Local Act.

7. —All property and estate whatsoever of the Commissioners acting in the execution of

the said Local Act shall be transferred to the said Local Board of Health, and shall, as near as circumstances will permit, be held by the said Local Board upon the same trusts, and for the same purposes, as by such Commissioners.

8. —All debts, monies and securities for money, payable by such Commissioners, shall be

satisfied by the said Local Board within the same times as they would have been by such Commissioners, out of such parts of the said transferred property and estate as would have been chargeable in respect of the same if this Order had not been made.

9. —Provided always, that if such property and estate be insufficient, the deficiency shall

be charged upon the rates leviable under the said Public Health Act in the parts only which would have been chargeable writh such deficiency if this Order had not been made.

10. —Provided also, that if such property and estate be more than sufficient, the surplus

shall be applied to the parts and purposes to which the same would have been applied if this Order had not been made.

11. —All expenses which shall be incurred by the said Local Board of Health under the

unvepealed parts of the said Local Act, and not defrayed out of the monies arising

under such Local Act, shall be deemed to be expenses incurred under the said

Public Health Act, and shall be defrayed out of the Rates leviable under that Act

(as the nature of the case may require); and the monies necessary to be raised for the purposes of such Local Act may be raised as under the said Public Health Act; and the unrepealed parts of the said Local Act shall be incorporated with the said Public Health Act, and shall extend to all parts comprised within the boundaries of the said Borough.

12. —The sections of the Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847, with respect to naming

the streets and numbering the houses, and with respect to improving the line of the streets and removing obstructions, and with respect to ruinous or dangerous buildings, and with respect to precautions during the construction and repair of the sewers, streets, and houses, and the sections with respect to the abatement of nuisances numbered 104, 105, and 106 in the copies of the said Act printed by the Queen's Printers, and the sections with respect to the prevention of smoke, and with respect to the construction of houses for the prevention of fire, and with respect to supplying buildings with fresh *ur, and with respect to clocks, and the sections of the 16 VICTt U Towns

the County of Montgomery.

General Board of Health.

Whereas, in pursuance of the Public Health Act, 1848, the General Board of Health appointed for the purposes of the said Act have, upon the petition of not less than one tenth of the inhabitants rated to the relief of the poor of and within the boundaries of the parish of Pool, in the county of Montgomery, (the number of the said petitioners greatly exceeding thirty in the whole,) directed George Thomas Clark, a Superintending Inspector, appointed for the purposes of the said Act, to visit the said Parish, and to make public inquiry, and to examine witnesses as to the sewerage, drainage, and supply of water, the state of the burial grounds, the number and sanitary condition of the inhabitants, and

151

16° VICTORIA, c.24.

as to any Local Actsof Parliament in force within such Parish for paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, regulating, supplying with water, or improving the said Parish, or having relation to the purposes of the said Act; also, as to the natural drainage areas, and the existing municipal, parochial, or other local boundaries, and the boundaries which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, having previously given the notices directed by the said Act, proceeded upon the said inquiry in the manner directed by the said Act, and hath reported in writing to the said General Board upon the several matters with respect to which he was so directed to inquire as aforesaid, and upon certain other matters in respect to which he deemed it expedient to report for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas, it having appeared to the said General Board upon such Report that the boundaries which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Act were not the same as those of the said Parish, the said General Board, in further pursuance of the said Act, caused the same Superintending Inspector (after having given the notices required by the said Act in that behalf) to visit the parts within the boundaries proposed to be adopted for the purposes of the said Act, to hear all persons desirous of being heard before him upon the subject of the said Report, and to make further inquiry and report to the said Board thereon.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, having previously given the notices directed by the said Act in this behalf, proceeded upon the said further inquiry in the manner required by the said Act, and hath made a further Report, as directed by the said General Board.

Aijd whereas it appears to the said General Board to be expedient that the said Act, except as herein-after provided, should be applied to such parts of the parish of Pool and the adjoining parish of Guilsfield, as are respectively comprised within the dotted line referred to and described a$ " proposed boundary," on the plan appended to and forming part of the said further Report of the said Superintending Inspector, the same being entirely included within the boundaries of the municipal borough of Pool or Welshpool, as fixed for the purposes of an Act passed in the sixth year of the reign of King William the Fourth, intituled " An Act to provide for the Regulation of Municipal Corporations in England u and Wales;" but the same cannot be done without the authority of Parliament, by reason that the boundaries to be adopted for the purposes of the said Act are not the same as those of the place from whence the said petition proceeded.

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the power vested in the said Board by the said Act, we, the General Board of Health appointed for the purposes of the said Act, do by this Provisional Order under our hands and seal of office, order and direct:—

1. —That from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this present Order,

as aforesaid, may in all rates, or legal or other proceedings or writings whatsoever, be called " The Welshpool Paved and Lighted District " of the District of Welshpool.

4.—That from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this order, and when the said lighted District shall be ascertained and fixed as aforesaid, the costs and expenses of or relating to the paving and lighting of the said lighted District shall be defrayed out of a rate in the nature of a general district rate, to be from time to time made and levied upon the occupier and occupiers of all such kinds of property, within the said paved and lighted District, exclusively of the rest of the said Borough, as by the laws in force for the time being are or may be assessable to any rate for the relief of the poor, and shall be assessed upon the full net annual value of such property ascertained by the rates (if any) for the relief of the poor made next before the making of the said assessment; and the said rate shall be called " The Welshpool Paving and Lighting Rate," and shall be carried to a separate account, to be called " The Welshpool Paving and Lighting Fund Account;" and all the provisions relating to general district rates in such part of the said Public Health Act, 1848, as is hereby ordered to be applied to the said District shall, so far as they are not inconsistent with this Order and the several provisions thereof, apply to the paving and lighting rates to be levied under and in pursuance the aforesaid provisions.

V. ' And whereas it is expedient to make further Provision for preventing the vexatious No Certiorari

An Act to provide for the Purchase and Extinguishment of all Rights of Common and Lammas and other Commonable Rights over the Site of Battersea Park in the County of Surrey. [4th August 1853.]

WHEREAS under and by virtue of the Enactments, Powers, and Provisions contained ff ' V in the Act of the Ninth and Tenth Years of Her present Majesty, Chapter Thirty-' eight, and the Act of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Years of Her present Majesty, Chapter

Seventy-seven, the Battersea Park Commissioners were authorized and empowered to pur-€ chase and hold divers Lands and Hereditaments specified in a Schedule annexed to the g first-mentioned Act, situate in Battersea Fields in the Parish of Saint Mary Battersea in the ( County of Surrey, for the Purpose of forming a public Park there, to be called Battersea € Parky and for other Purposes: And whereas, in pursuance of the Provisions of the said € Acts or One of them, certain of the aforesaid Lands and Hereditaments have been pur-( chased and are now vested in the said Battersea Park Commissioners for the Purposes s aforesaid, and the said Commissioners purpose from Time to Time hereafter to purchase e such further Portions of the aforesaid Lands and Hereditaments as they may consider s requisite for the Purposes aforesaid: And whereas by the first-mentioned Act it was ' amongst other things enacted, that in all Cases where there should be Occasion to cut € through, take, or use for the Purposes aforesaid any Part or Parts of any Commons or c Waste Grounds or other Lands or Hereditaments which should be charged with or subject ( to any Right or Rights of Common, whether of Pasture, Turbary, Estover, or Piscary, or c other Easements whatsoever, appendant, appurtenant, or in gross, or whether created or s subsisting by Grant, Prescription, Custom, or otherwise howsoever, the Conveyance thereof f by any Body Politic, Corporate, or Collegiate, or other Person or Persons, having such ' and the like Estate and Interest of and in the Manor wherein such Lands, Commons, f Waste Grounds, or Hereditaments should be situate or (if the same should not be the Waste ( of any Manor) then having such and the like Estate and Interest of and in the Soil of such ' Lands, Commons, Wastes, and Hereditaments, as the Body or Bodies Politic, Corporate,

' or Collegiate, or Persons, who by virtue of the said Act were enabled to sell and convey ' other Lands and Hereditaments, should be a good and sufficient Conveyance of the Fee € Simple and Inheritance of such Waste Grounds or Common or other Lands or Heredita-( ments for the Purposes aforesaid, as fully and effectually as if every Person having such ' Right or Rights of Common upon such Common or Waste Ground, Lands, or Heredita-s ments were 6eised thereof in Fee Simple in possession, and had joined in and executed ' such Conveyance, and that the Compensation to be paid for any Right of Common upon € any such Common or Waste Ground, Lands, or Hereditaments to be settled in the Manner

by the said first-mentioned Act directed should be paid to the Churchwardens of the Parish ' or respective Parishes in which such Common or Waste Lands should lie, and should be ' by such Churchwardens applied for such general and public Purposes within such Parishes c respectively as a Vestry of such respective Parishes to be convened by such Churchwardens f for that Purpose should direct: And whereas the Inhabitants of the said Parish of ' Saint Mary Battersea, at a Vestry Meeting held on the Eighth Day of July One thousand c eight hundred and fifty-two, unanimously resolved that the Churchwardens should be

authorized, on the Part of the Parishioners, in respect of their Common Rights, either as ' Freeholders, Copyholders, or Tenants, or Parishioners, of all the said Lands named in the

Schedule to the first-mentioned Act, to accept the Sum of One thousand five hundred ' Pounds by way of Compensation for the Extinguishment of such and all other Rights ( over all such said Lands: And whereas it was intended by the said Parishioners that ' the said Sum of One thousand five hundred Pounds should include the Purchase or Com-€ pensation Money to be paid in respect of all Lammas Rights and other Commonable Rights c existing or alleged to exist in, over, or upon all the Lands mentioned in the said Resolution,

although not Common or Waste Lands; but it is doubtful whether the Terms of the afore-c said Provisions of the first-mentioned Act include such last-mentioned Lammas and other ' Commonable Rights: And whereas Doubts are also entertained as to how the Monies to be

( paid

249

16° & 17° VICTORIA, c.47,48.

paid as the Price or Compensation for such Eights of Common and Commonable Eights 6 as aforesaid ought to be paid and applied under the Provisions of the said first-recited Act:

And whereas it is just and necessary, for the Purpose of effecting the Purposes of the said c Acts, that on Payment of the Sum of One thousand five hundred Pounds by the said c Battersea Park Commissioners all Eights of Common and Commonable Eights whatsoever ' in, over, or upon all the Lands comprised in the said Schedule to the first-mentioned Act, and ' which have been purchased as aforesaid, or which shall hereafter be purchased, should be ' absolutely extinguished; but it is apprehended that the same cannot be completely effected c without the Authority of Parliament:' May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be .it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

I. It shall be lawful for the said Battersea Park Commissioners, out of any Monies coming to their Hands applicable to the Purposes of the said Acts, to pay to the Churchwardens for the Time being of the said Parish of Saint Alary Battersea the Sum of One thousand five hundred Pounds, to be by such Churchwardens or their Successors applied for such general and public Purposes within the said Parish as a Vestry of the same Parish, to be convened by such Churchwardens for that Purpose, shall direct; and immediately on such Payment all Eights of Common whatsoever, and all Lammas Eights and other Commonable Eights whatsoever existing or claimed by any Body Politic, Corporate, or Collegiate, or any Person or Persons whatsoever, in, upon, or over all or any Part or Parts of the said Lands and Hereditaments specified in the Schedule to the said first-mentioned Act, and already purchased by the said Commissioners, shall absolutely cease and be extinguished; and as regards any other of the said Hereditaments which shall hereafter be purchased, then from the Date of such Purchase such Eights shall also cease and be extinguished, and whether the same be Common or Waste Lands or not.

II. The Eeceipt or Eeceipts in Writing of the Churchwardens for the Time being of the said Parish of Saint Mary Battersea shall be a full and sufficient Discharge to the said Battersea Park Commissioners for the said Sum of One thousand five hundred Pounds or any Part thereof, and they shall not be in anywise bound to see to the Application thereof.

III. It shall be sufficient for all Purposes to cite this Act as " The Battersea Park Act, 1853."

An Act to amend the Laws relating to Bankruptcy in Scotland.

[4th August 1853.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the Session of Parliament holden in the Second and ' - * Third Years of the Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act for regulating ' the Sequestration of the Estates of Bankrupts in Scotland; and it is expedient that the ' said Act be in some respects altered and amended, and that further Provision be made for € the due Management and more speedy Distribution of the Estates of Bankrupts under € Sequestration in Scotland;' Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

I. The Interim Factor, in place of being elected, as at present, shall be appointed by the Lord Ordinary by whom Sequestration shall be awarded, or by the Sheriff of the County, upon a Remit to that Effect by the Lord Ordinary; and such Interim Factor shall as soon as may be after his Appointment take possession of the Bankrupt's Estate and Effects, and of his Title Deeds, Books, Bills, Vouchers, and other Papers and Documents, and also make up an Inventory of such Estate and Effects, and a Valuation showing the estimated Value and the annual Rental or Revenue thereof; and every such Interim Factor shall find Caution for his Intromissions to such Amount as the Lord Ordinary, or the Sheriff, where such Factor shall be appointed by the Sheriff, shall fix; and on such Caution being so found and received such Interim Factor shall be entitled to act, and a certified Copy of the Interlocutor containing his Appointment shall be equivalent to a formal Extract thereof; and such Interim Factor snail be entitled to make such Arrangements for the carrying on of the Trade of the Bankrupt as he may think beneficial for the Estate.

IL The Deliverance awarding Sequestration shall appoint a Meeting of the Creditors, to be held at a specified Hour on a specified Day, being not earlier than Twelve nor later than Twenty-one Days from the Date of such Deliverance, to elect a Trustee or Trustees in succession, and Commissioners, and to do the other Acts provided by the said recited Act to be done at the Meeting for electing a Trustee.

III. It shall not be imperative upon the Lord Ordinary, when awarding Sequestration, to grant to the Debtor or Partners of the Company against whom or which Sequestration is awarded a Warrant of Protection against Arrest or Imprisonment for Civil Debt until the Meeting of the Creditors for the Election of Trustee, but the Lord Ordinary may, while awarding Sequestration, refuse to grant such Warrant of Protection; and every such Warrant of Protection which may be granted in any Sequestration that shall not be advertised in the London and Edinburgh Gazettes in Terms of the said recited Act within One Week after the Date of such Sequestration shall be ineffectual, and incapable of being pleaded in Bar of personal Diligence: Provided always, that, notwithstanding the Lord Ordinary shall refuse to grant Interim Warrant of Protection as aforesaid, it shall be competent to the Creditors, on the Occasion of their meeting to elect a Trustee, or at the Meeting after the Examination of the Bankrupt, or at any meeting called for the Purpose of receiving an Offer of Composition, to resolve that personal Protection ought to be granted to the Bankrupt for such Time as they may think fit, and the Trustee shall thereupon apply to the Sheriff, who shall grant the Protection.

IV. The Deliverance of the Sheriff or Sheriff Substitute, declaring the Person or Persons elected to be Trustee or Trustees in succession, shall be final, and in no Case subject to Review in any Court or in any Manner whatever.

V. It shall be the Duty of the Trustee, immediately after the Examination of the Bankrupt, to notify, by circular Letter transmitted through the Post Office to every Creditor mentioned in the State of Affairs which by the said recited Act is directed to be made up by the Bankrupt, the Period within which Claims should be lodged.

VIL Where it shall appear to the Sheriff or to the Trustee that the Oath and Claim of any Person, produced with a view to voting or to ranking and drawing a Dividend on the Sequestration, is not framed in the Manner required by the said recited Act, the Sheriff or the Trustee, as the Case may be, shall call upon such Person, or his Procurator or Mandatory, to rectify his Oath and Claim, pointing out to him wherein it is defective; and unless such Person shall thereupon make such Alteration upon his Oath and Claim as mav be necessary in order to rectify the same, the Sheriff or Trustee, as the Case may be, shall disallow or reject such Oath and Claim: Provided always, that where the Failure to comply with the Provisions of the said recited Act shall appear to have been made for some improper or fraudulent Purpose, or where Injury can be qualified by the other Creditors or any of them in respect thereof, it shall not be incumbent upon the Sheriff or Trustee to give such Person an Opportunity to rectify his Oath and Claim as aforesaid.

VIIL The Day to be fixed by the Sheriff for the Examination of the Bankrupt shall be not sooner than Seven Days nor later than Fourteen Days from the Date of the Sheriff's Warrant for such Examination; and the Meeting of Creditors appointed by the said recited Act to be held after the Examination of the Bankrupt shall be held on a Day not sooner than Seven Days nor later than Fourteen Days from the Day appointed for such Examination.

poses) the Taxation of Bills of Costs in Common Law Business in Ireland, and by the said ' first-recited Act it was amongst other things enacted, that it should be lawful to and for the ' Lord Lieutenant or other Chief Governor or Governors of Ireland from Time to Time to ' appoint Two Officers, who should he and be called Taxing Officers in Common Law ( Business, who should have Power to tax the several Classes of Costs therein mentioned, and ' that after the Commencement of the said first-recited Act the several Classes of Costs therein 6 mentioned should not be taxed by any other Officer or Person whomsoever, and it was ' thereby further enacted, that each of the said Taxing Officers should be entitled to receive 6 out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom the yearly Sum of One thousand two ( hundred Pounds (of the then Currency of Ireland), to be payable as therein mentioned: c And whereas by an Act passed in the Seventh and Eighth Years of the Reign of Her c Majesty Queen Victoria, intituled An Act to regulate and reduce the Expenses of the ( Offices attached to the Superior Courts of Late in Ireland payable out of the Consolidated

Corner of each Card shall be cut off at least Half an Inch in Depth, and other Provisions ' are therein contained for securing the said Duties: And whereas Packs or Parcels of Cards ' fit and intended for Use and Play, but not containing an Ace of Spades duly stamped, are ' commonly sold under the Pretence of being Waste Cards, each of such Cards having a

Corner cut off, whereby the said Duties are evaded; and it is expedient to prevent such ' Practice:'

4 at Prime Cost or otherwise,) by certain of the Owners of or Parties interested in ' the Tenements situated on the River Frontage along which the said intended Em-

bankment and Roadway were to pass, in consideration of the Benefit which would f accrue therefrom to their said respective Tenements, and that certain of such Parties ' were willing to contribute accordingly in some of the Modes aforesaid, and that it ' was intended that they should respectively enter into Agreements with the said Commis-' sioners of Her Majesty's Woods, Forests, Land Revenues, Works, and Buildings, to make ' such Contribution accordingly in such Sums or otherwise as the Lord High Treasurer,

' or the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Treasurer, should approve ' of; and that no Part of the said intended Embankment and Roadway should be com-' menced until after all such Agreements as aforesaid, so approved of as aforesaid, should

II. For the Purposes of this Act all the Enactments of the said recited Acts, except so far as the same are varied by or inconsistent with the Provisions of this Act, shall be considered as herein repeated, with the Substitution of the said amended Plans and Designs for the Plans and Designs mentioned in the said first-recited Act, and of the Schedule annexed to this Act for the Schedule annexed to the said first-recited Act, and of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Works and Public Buildings for the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods, Forests, Land Revenues, Works, and Buildings: Provided nevertheless, that if the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Works and Public Buildings shall not, within the Space of Four Years, to commence and be computed from the First Day of July One thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, purchase and take the Tenements and Hereditaments or Parts thereof respectively which they are by this Act, by Reference as aforesaid, empowered to take, use, and purchase, then the compulsory Powers for such Purpose shall cease.

III. It shall be lawful for the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Works and Public Buildings, with the Consent of Her Majesty, Her Heirs or Successors, and of the Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City of London, to construct the said Embankment and Roadway on certain Portions of the Bed and Shore of the River Thames, between Cadogan Pier and Battersea Bridge, beyond the Limits of Deviation on the said deposited Plaus: Provided always, that the Embankment and Roadway so constructed beyond the said Limits of Deviation shall not project, encroach upon, or interfere with the Bed and Shore of the said River to a greater Distance in any Part thereof than Thirty-five Feet from the said Limits of Deviation as shown on the said Plans.

IV.

An Act for the further Relief of the Suitors of the High Court of Chancery.

[20th August 1853.]

WHEREAS it is expedient to make further Provision for the Relief of the Suitors of ' * " the High Court of ChanceryBe it therefore enaoted by the Queen's most Excellent

Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, ns follows:

I. It shall be lawfhl for the Lord Chancellor, at such Time within Nine Calendar Months after the passing of this Act as shall appear to him to be most convenient, to cause an Investigation to be made into the several Accounts standing in the Name of the said Accountant General to the Credit of any Cause or Matter the Dividends of which shall not have been dealt with for Fifteen Years or upwards prior to such Time, aud if and when he shall be of opinion that it is not probable that any Claim null be made for the same, to make Orders for the Appropriation of the future Dividends to accrue due on such Stock, or such Part of such Dividends as he shall be of opinion may safely and properly be so appropriated, as the same shall accrue, for the Benefit of the Suitors of the said Court, and for the carrying the same over to the Credit of an Account to be entitled "The Suitors Unclaimed Dividend Account," and for the carrying from Time to Time such Part of the Cash standing to the last-mentioned Account as he may think fit oyer to the Credit of the Account in the Book* of the said

Accountant

Funds, the Dividends of which have not been received for Fifteen Years, may b? transferred to the Suitors Fee] Fund Account.

548

16° & 17* VICTORIA, c.98.

Rights of Suitors to Stock or Dividends transferred not to be affected, but to be satisfied out of the Suitors Fee Fund.

Periodical Investigations and Transfers to be made of Accounts the Dividends of which have not been received for Fifteen Years.

Accountant General called " The Suitors Fee Fund Account," and such Dividends when so carried over shall thereupon become Part of the Fund standing to such Account .

II. The Right of any Suitor of the said Court to the Stock the Dividends of which shall be appropriated by any such Order or Orders as aforesaid, or to the Dividends so directed to be appropriated, shall not be in anywise prejudiced or affected by such Order or Orders, or by such Appropriation in pursuance thereof as aforesaid, but the Claims of such Suitor or Suitors shall be made good and satisfied out of the Fund standing to the Credit of the Accounts called " The Suitors Fee Fund Account" and "The Suitors Unclaimed Dividend Account," or either of them, by virtue of any Order or Orders to be from Time to Time made by the said Court for that Purpose; and if and when it shall become necessary for the Purposes aforesaid, it shall be lawful for the Lord Chancellor, by any Order or Orders to be from Time to Time made for that Purpose, to impose such Fees in relation to Proceedings in the said Court of Chancery as to him shall seem meet, and to direct that such Fees shall be collected by means of Stamps, to be provided and used in the Manner now adopted with reference to Fees collected by means of Stamps in the said Court, and to alteri diminish, or abolish such new or additional Fees, as Circumstances may from Time to Time warrant him in so doing.

III. At the Expiration of every Five Years from such First Investigation as aforesaid it shall be lawful for the Lord Chancellor to cause a similar Investigation to be made into the several Accounts standing in the Name of the said Accountant General to the Credit of any Cause or Matter the Dividends of which shall not have been received for Fifteen Years or upwards prior to such Time, and thereupon the same Course shall be pursued in every respect with respect to such Accounts as is herein-before directed with respect to the Investigation so to be made within Nine Calendar Months after the passing of this Act; and the Provisions herein-before contained saving the Rights of the Suitor to any Dividends which may have been appropriated upon or in consequence of such Investigation, and giving Power to the Lord Chancellor to impose, alter, diminish, or abolish Fees in consequence thereof, shall extend and be applicable to every successive Investigation so to be made as aforesaid.

&c. issued from Monies placed out to provide for Chancery Officers to be transferred to Suitors Fee Fund.

IV. ' And whereas there is now standing in the Name of the Accountant General of the

said Court, to the Credit of the Account intituled " Account of Monies placed out to pro-( vide for the Officers of the High Court of Chancery," the Sum of Two hundred and one ' thousand and twenty-eight Pounds Two Shillings and Threepence Bank Three Pounds ' per Cent Annuities, and the Amount of Cash which has arisen from Dividends thereon: 1 And whereas under the Act passed in the Session of Parliament holden in the Third and ' Fourth Years of King William the Fourth, Chapter Ninety-four, Section Thirty-six, the c Dividends arising from the Fund standing to the Credit of the said last-mentioned Account € are directed or authorized to be invested in the Purchase of Parliamentary or Government ' Securities in the Name of the said Accountant General, to be by him placed to the Credit ' of the said last-mentioned Account: And whereas it is unnecessary to continue the Accu-' mulation of the Dividends on the Funds so as aforesaid standing to the Credit of the said f last-mentioned Account, and it is expedient that such Dividends should from Time to Time

be applied in aid of the Fund called the Suitors Fee FundBe it therefore enacted, That the Dividends and annual Produce which have arisen and which shall arise from the Monies placed out on the Account intituled " Account of Monies placed out to provide for the Officers of the High Court of Chancery " shall be carried over by the said Accountant General, and be placed to the said Account intituled " The Suitors Fee Fund Account," and shall thereupon become Part of the Fund standing to such Account, and be dealt with accordingly.

Reduced Stamp V.

VII. It shall be lawful for the Lord Chancellor, whenever it shall seem expedient to him so to do, to empower and direct the Accountant General of the said Court to receive and act upon Letters or Powers of Attorney granted by any Person to whom any Sum or Sums of Money shall by any Order in any Cause or Matter be directed to be paid, authorizing the Attorney of such Person to receive, not only a Cheque, Note, or Draft ibr the Sum or Sums of Money so ordered to be paid, but all Cheques, Notes, or Drafts for any further or other Sum or Sums of Money which by any Order or Orders to be thereafter made in the same Cause or Matter, or any Cause or Matter connected therewith, shall be ordered to be paid to such Person or Persons by or out of any Fund then or thereafter to be standing to the Credit of such Cause or Matter; and the Lord Chancellor shall by Order make such Provision as he may deem necessary for satisfying the Accountant General of the Identity of the Person named in Two or more Orders.

VIII. i And whereas under various Acts of Parliament now in force, or under Orders € made in pursuance of such Acts, Compensation Allowances have been granted and are ' payable to various Officers of the said Court, which have been made to cease upon such

Officers obtaining other Offices or Employments, during the Continuance of such Officers ( iu the same: And whereas it has happened that Officers of the said Court entitled to ( Compensation Allowances have obtained other Offices or Employments in the said Court i or the Offices thereof, and by reason of Malversation iu such Offices or Employments have ' been dismissed therefrom or have resigned the same, and it is expedient that any Monies € improperly withheld by any such Officer should be made good to the Fund to which the

same ought to have been appliedIt shall be lawful for the Lord Chancellor, by any Order or Orders to be by him from Time to Time made for that Purpose, to direct that the whole or any Part of the Compensation Allowance payable to any rerson who shall have held any Office or Employment in the said Court by virtue of any Act or Acts of Parliament heretofore passed or hereafter to be passed, or any Order or Orders in pursuance thereof, shall be applied in Payment to the Fund from which such Monies as aforesaid shall have been abstracted, for the Purpose of making good the same, with such Interest thereon from the Time the same may have been received as the Lord Chancellor may think proper, and with the Costs of making and acting upon the said Orders; and any Order or Orders so to be made shall over-reach any Assignment or Assignments which after the Tenth Day of February One thousand eight hundred and fifty-three shall have been made of any such Compensation Allowance, whether made voluntarily or for a good and valuable Consideration.

calculate with Certainty the Amount which will be necessary for that Purpose, or to

determine with Precision the Manner in which such Amount shall be applied, and it is € therefore expedient that all due Claims of the said Cinque Port Pilots, their Widows,

( Appointees, and Issue, should be provided for by the said Trinity House out of their

General Pilotage Funds as herein-before provided, and that the Board of Trade and the

Trinity House should be intrusted with such Powers as are necessary for settling the said

his own Vessel without the Assistance of a licensed Pilot upon nis passing an Examination ' before or under the Direction of the proper Pilotage Authorities, and obtaining a Certificate € as therein mentioned, but the Institution of such Examination was left to the Option of the

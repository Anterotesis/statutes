Seventh Year of the Reign of King George the Fourth as enacts that no Person or Persons, other than or beside the Justices of the Peace for the said City and Liberty of and also the

Commissioners for executing an Act passed in the Twenty-third Year of the Reign of His Majesty King George the Second, intituled An Act for the more easy and speedy Recovery of Small Debts within the City and Liberty of Westminster and that Part of the Duchy of Lancaster which adjoins thereto, shall have Power or Authority to commit any Person or Persons to the said New Bridewell or Douse of Correction, or to the Custody of the Keeper thereof, shall be repealed; and that after the passing of this Act the said New Bridewell shall become and be a House of Correction for the County of Middlesex, under the Management and Control of the Justices of the said County; and the Justices of the said County, the Magistrates of the Police Courts, the Judges of the Central Criminal Court, and all Persons having by Law the Right to commit any Offender or Offenders to the House of Correction in Cold Bath Fields, or to the Gaol of Newgate as the Common Gaol of London and Middlesex, in execution of their Judgments, shall have the like Power of Committal to the said New Bridewell which they have of committing to the said House of Correction or the said Gaol of Newgate: Provided always, that nothing in this Act contained shall take away the Right of the

A*ndment include all the Places to which the Provisions of such Acts, according^ aw* to the Purposes thereof, ought to apply, and moreover such Provisions require Alteration and Amendment, it is expedient to extend such Limits, and otherwise to amend such Acts: And forasmuch as improve-in many Parts of the Metropolis and the Neighbourhood thereof the ment of Drainage of the Houses is so imperfect as to endanger the Health of Drainage. the Inhabitants, it is expedient to make Provision for facilitating and promoting the Improvement of such Drainage: And forasmuch as by Securing a reason of the Narrowness of Streets, Lanes, and Alleys, and the Want sufficient of a Thoroughfare in many Places, the due Ventilation of crowded Width of Neighbourhoods is often impeded, and the Health of the Inhabitants Street8»&c-thereby endangered, and from the close Contiguity of the opposite flouses the Risk of Accident by Fire is extended, it is expedient 8 R to

Rule for ascertaining Height.

The Height of every Building is to be ascertained by measuring from the Surface of the lowest Floor of the Building up to the under Side of the Ceiling of the topmost Story at the highest Part thereof, whether such Story be within the Roof or not.

And if there be no Ceiling made or intended to be made to the topmost Story, then by measuring from the Surface of such lowest Floor of the Building up to the under Side of any Tie-beam, Collar-beam, or other Substitute for a Tie-beam, to or within the Roof of the Building, and to the highest Part of such Roof; and the Level of the under Side of such Tie-beam, or such Substitute for a Tie-beam, is in such Case to be taken to mean the Ceiling of the topmost Story.

And if there be no Tie-beam, Collar-beam, or other Substitute for a Tie-beam to or within the Roof of any Building, then up to a Level Three Feet below the Level of the under Side of the Ridge-piece, or Substitute for a Ridge-piece, to the Roof of such Building.

Rule for ascertaining Area.

And the Area of every Building is to be determined by the Number of Squares contained in the Surface of any Floor which shall contain the greatest Number of Squares at or above the principal Entrance to such Building, including in such Surface the Area of all the external Walls, and such Portions oi the Party Walls, as belong to such Building, but excluding from such Surface the Area of any attached Building or Office, Area, Balcony, or open Portico.

Rule for ascertaining the Capacity of any Building of the Second Class.

Rule for ascertaining Number of Stories.

And the Stories of every Building are to be counted from the Foundation upwards.

And if the Space in Height between the Top of the Footings and the Level of the lowest Floor do not exceed Five Feet, then the Story nearest the Foundation is to be considered the lowest or first Story; bijt if such Space exceed Five Feet, then such Space is to be considered to contain the lowest or first Story; and in that Case Nine Inches above the Top of the Footing is to be considered the Level of the lowest Floor.

Rule for ascertaining Thickness of Walls.

And the Thickness or Width of every Wall, and of the Footing thereof, is to be ascertained by measuring only the Thickness or Width of which such Walls or Footings shall have been originally built.

XVIII. And be it enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, in all Cases in which any Person shall be charged by any Coroner's Inquisition with the Commission of any Crime, and shall be subsequently put upon his Trial, either on such Inquisition, or in pursuance of any Bill of Indictment found for the same, the Coroner before whom such Inquisition shall have been found shall be wholly incompetent to act as an Attorney in Prosecution or Defence of suen

Person for such Crime, either by himself or his Partner (directly or indirectly); and that in all Cases in which it shall appear to the Judge before whom such Person shall be tried that any Coroner shall have so acted contrary to the Provision and Intention of this Act, such Judge shall impose upon every Coroner so offending such Penalty, not exceeding Fifty Pounds, as the said Judge shall in his Discretion think fit.

XXI. And whereas Doubts have arisen as to the Power of the Justices to order the Payment of Allowances for travelling in any Case where an Inquisition has not been taken, although such Coroner has been compelled to travel from his usual Place of Abode for the Purpose of taking an Inquisition; be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Justices of the Peace in their General or Quarter Sessions assembled for the County, Riding, Division, or Liberty where such Inquisition would have lieen taken, or the major Part of them, if they shall see fit, to order the Payment of such Allowances for travelling to any Coroner who shall show, to the Satisfaction of the said Justices, that he had been compelled, in the Discharge of his Office, to travel from his usual Place of Abode for the Purpose of taking an Inquisition, but which, in the Exercise of his Discretion, he deemed to be unnecessary, and declined to take.

XXIII. And whereas by an Act passed in the Sixth Year of the

Reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, intituled An Act for the more

convenient holding of Coroners Inque, it was enacted, that for the

Purpose of holding Coroners Inquests every detached Part of a County, Riding, or Division shall be deemed to be within that County, Riding, or Division by which it is wholly surrounded, or where it is partly surrounded by Two or more Counties, within that one with which it has the longest common Boundary: And whereas as to some such detached Parts of Counties, Ridings, or Divisions there were at the Time of the passing of the last-mentioned Act Coroners appointed expressly for and having Jurisdiction in such detached Parts only, and Doubts have arisen whether such last-mentioned Coroners were superseded by such last-mentioned Act; be it therefore enacted, That as to every such detached Part of any County for which at the Time of the passing of the said last-mentioned Act there was a Coroner appointed for and acting in such detached Part such last-mentioned Coroner shall (if now living, and not having resigned, or been removed from his Office otherwise than by the Operation of the said Act,) continue to hold and exercise his former Office and Jurisdiction within such detached Part for so long a Time and in such Manner as such Coroner would have held and exercised the said Office and Jurisdiction if the said last-mentioned Act had not passed.

XXIV. And be it enacted, That the Treasurer of every County shall keep an Account of all Expences occasioned to such County by any Inquest in or with respect to any such detached Part of any other County, and shall twice in every Year send a Copy of such Account to the Treasurer of the other County to which suen detached Part belongs; and the Treasurer of such other County shall, out of the Monies in his Hands as Treasurer, pay the same to the Order of

said Charter: And whereas certain Tenements lying within the same Manors respectively, and usually called " Conventionary Tenements," have been held under Grants made and renewed at the Courts called Assession Courts, holden under Commissions for that Purpose generally once in every Seven Years for the said Manors respectively, upon Payment of divers Fines and Acknowledgments and Fees, and subject to the Payment and Render of certain Rents, Heriots, and Services; and Surrenders of and Admittances to the Estates created by such Assessional Grants have been usually made, taken, and granted at Courts held for the said Manors respectively before the Stewards or Deputy Stewards of the same: And whereas the Nature and Quantity of the Estates created by such Grants have been disputed, but the said Conventionary Tenements have by the Tenants thereof been usually considered to be held as Customary Tenements of Inheritance, with a perpetual Right of Renewal, and have by the said Tenants been conveyed and assured and dealt with accordingly: And whereas the Mines and

metallic Minerals in, upon, and under the said Conventionary Tenements, and the Freehold thereof, have always belonged to the Duke of Cornwall; but the Right of the Duke of Cornwall to enter upon the said Conventionary Tenements, and work, get, and dispose of the Mines and metallic Minerals in, upon, and under the same, has been disputed: And whereas the Manors comprised in the said Second Schedule hereto annexed were some time since sold and disposed of under the Authority of a certain Act for the Redemption of Land Tax, but with the express Exception and Reservation, in the several Conveyances thereof, of all Mines and Minerals within and under the same, with full and free Liberty of Ingress, Egress, and Regress to dig, search for, take, use, and work the 3aid Mines and Minerals; but it is apprehended that the Expression " Minerals" in such Exceptions and Reservation was intended to mean metallic Minerals only: And whereas various Disputes have lately arisen as to the said Conventionary Tenements of the said Manors comprised in the said First Schedule hereto annexed, and in consequence thereof no Assession Courts have been held for any of the same Manors since the Year One thousand eight hundred and thirty-three: And whereas the Mines, Minerals, Stone, and Substrata in, upon, under, and of divers waste and other Lands within the said Manors comprised in the said First Schedule hereto annexed, and the Mines and metallic Minerals in, upon, and under divers waste and other Lands within the said Manors comprised in the said Second Schedule hereto annexed, respectively belong, or are claimed to belong, to the Duke of Cornwall: And whereas the said Conventionary Tenements holden of the said Manors comprised in the said First and Second Schedules hereto annexed are very vaguely and uncertainly described in the Grants thereof, and the boundaries, Identity, and Situation thereof, and of the waste and other Lands lying within the said Manors respectively, which, or the Mines, Minerals, Stone, and Substrata in, upon, under, and of which, belong or are claimed to belong to the Duke of Cornwall, as aforesaid, are in many Cases disputed, and in other Cases not clearly ascertained or distinguished, and several Purprestures and Encroachments are supposed to have been made in and upon the Lands, Mines, Minerals, and Hereditaments of the Duke of Cornwall

within

* within the said Manors respectively: And whereas the Value as well of the said Conventionary Tenements, as of the other Lands,

Mines, Minerals, and Hereditaments within the said Manors comprised in the said First and Second Schedules hereto annexed, has been greatly diminished by reason of the Premises: And whereas the several Statutes for the Limitation of Actions, Suits, and Claims by Her Majesty, Her Heirs or Successors, and by others the Subjects of Her Majesty, are for the most Part inapplicable to the Lands and Possessions of the Duchy of Cornwall: And whereas it is expedient, for the Interest as well of the Duke of Cornwall as of all other Persons interested therein, or whose Lands adjoin thereto, that the Boundaries, Identity, and Situation of the said Conventionary Tenements of the said Manors respectively comprised in the said First and Second Schedules hereto annexed, and of the waste and other Lands lying within the same Manors respectively, and which, or the Mines, Minerals, Stone, or Substrata in, upon, under, or of which, belong or are claimed to belong to the Duke of Cornwall as aforesaid, and of all other Lands within the said Manors which belong or are claimed to belong to the Duke of Cornwall, and the Particulars of the Purprestures and Encroachments herein-before referred to, should be ascertained and determined in manner herein-after provided; and that the Estates of the Tenants in the said Conventionary Tenements held of the said Manors comprised in the said First Schedule hereto annexed should be established, and the Tenure thereof converted into Freehold, on the Terms and Conditions hereinafter mentioned; and that the Rights and Estates of the Duke of Cornwall and all other Persons in respect of the Mines, Minerals,

Stone, and Substrata in, upon, under, and of the Conventionary Tenements held of the said Manors comprised in the said First and Second Schedules hereunto annexed, and in, upon, under, and of all waste and other Lands within the same Manors respectively, the Mines, Minerals, Stone, or Substrata in, upon, under, or of which belong or are claimed to belong to the Duke of ,

as to getting, selling, and disposing of the same, should be declared, established, and regulated; and that such Provision should be made as is herein-after contained for the Limitation of Actions,

Suits, and Claims by and on behalf of the Duke of Cornwall within the County of Cornwall; but the several Purposes aforesaid cannot be effected without the Aid and Authority of Parliament: Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That all and singular the Tenements Confirmation which were granted and held in Convention at the last Assession of the Es* Courts for the said Manors mentioned in the said First Schedule here- convention-unto annexed respectively, and which, if the Grants thereof had been ary Tenants duly renewed at subsequent Assession Courts holden for the said of the unsold Manors respectively in the ordinary Course, would have been held as Manors, such Conventionary Tenements by successive Grants continuously for Sixty Years or more before the First Day of May One thousand eight hundred and forty-four, shall, from and after the passing of this Act, and until such Award or Awards shall have been made as herein-after

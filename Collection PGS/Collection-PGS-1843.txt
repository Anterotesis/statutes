which shall be provided with special Warrants and Orders, prepared according to the Forms of the Annex (A.) of the present Treaty, may search every Merchant Vessel belonging to any one of the High Contracting Parties which shall on reasonable Grounds be suspected of being engaged in the Traffic in Slaves, or of having been fitted out for that Purpose, or of having been engaged in the Traffic during the Voyage in which she shall have been met with by the said Cruisers; and that such Cruisers may detain and send or carry away such Vessels, in order that they may be brought to Trial in the Manner hereafter agreed upon.

Nevertheless the above-mentioned Right of searching the Merchant Vessels of any one or other of the High Contracting Parties shall be exercised only by Ships of War whose Commanders shall have the Rank of Captain, or that of Lieutenant in the Royal or Imperial Navy, unless the Command shall by reason of Death or otherwise have devolved upon an Officer of inferior Rank; the Commander of such Ship of War shall be furnished with Warrants according to the Form annexed to the present Treaty, under Letter (A.)

The said mutual Right of Search shall not be exercised within the Mediterranean Sea: Moreover the Space within which the Exercise of the said Right shall be confined shall be bounded on the North by the Thirty-second Parallel of North Latitude; on the West, by the Eastern Coast of America, from the Point where the Thirty-second Parallel of North Latitude strikes that Coast, down to the Forty-fifth Parallel of South Latitude; on the South, by the Forty-fifth Parallel of South Latitude, from the Point where that Parallel strikes the Eastern Coast of America to the Eightieth Degree of Longitude East from the Meridian of Greenwich; and on the East, by the same Degree of Longitude, from the Point where it is intersected by the Forty-fifth Parallel of South Latitude, up to the Coast of India.

The Names of the Ships appointed for this Purpose and those of their Commanders snail be communicated by each of the High Contracting Parties to the others; and they shall reciprocally apprize each other every Time that a Cruiser shall be placed on a Station, or shall be recalled from thence, in order that the necessary Warrants may be delivered by the Governments authorizing the Search, and returned to those Governments by the Government which has received them, when those Warrants shall no longer be necessary for the Execution of the present Treaty.

Article IV—Immediately after the Government which employs the Cruisers shall have notified to the Government

The High Contracting Parties reserve to themselves the Right of making in these Instructions, by common Consent, such Alterations as Circumstances may render necessary.

The Cruisers of the High Contracting Parties shall mutually afford to each other Assistance in all Cases when it may be useful that they should act in concert.

When the Commander of the Cruiser shall not think fit to undertake himself the bringing in and the Delivery up of the detained Vessel, he shall intrust that Duty to an Officer of the Rank of Lieutenant in the Royal or Imperial Navy, or at least to the Officer who shall at the Time be the Third in Authority on board the detaining Ship.

Article VII.—If the Commander of a Cruiser of One of the High Contracting Parties should have Reason to suspect that a Merchant Vessel sailing under the Convoy of or in company with a Ship of War of One of the other Contracting Parties has been engaged in the Slave Trade, or has been fitted out for that Trade, he shall make known his Suspicions to the Commander of the Ship of War, who shall proceed alone to search the su

Article IV.—The Slaves shall not be disembarked till after the Vessel which contains them shall have arrived at the Place of Adjudication, in order that in the event of the Vessel not being adjudged legal Prize the Loss of the Proprietors may be more easily repaired; and even after the Slaves have arrived at such Place they are not to be landed without the Permission of the Mixed Court of Justice.

Additional Article to the Treaty concluded between Great Britain and Portugal for the Abolition of Slave Trade on the Third Day of July in the Year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and forty-two.

As the Object of this Treaty, and of the Three Annexes which form Part of it, is no other than that of preventing the Traffic in Slaves, without any Annoyance to the respective Merchant Shipping of the Two Nations, and as this fraudulent Traffic is earned on from the Coast of Africa, where th6 Crown of Partugal has also extensive Colonial Possessions, where legitimate Commerce exists, and which it is important, in the Spirit of this Treaty, to promote and protect, the High Contracting Parties, animated by the same Sentiments, agree that if in future it should appear necessary to either of them to adopt new Measures or alter any of the Executive Regulations for attaining the said beneficent Object, or for obviating any unforeseen Inconvenience to the aforesaid Shipping or lawful Commerce which, Experience shall have made known, in consequence of those established in this Treaty and its Annexes proving inefficacious or injurious, the said High Contracting Parties engage to consult together for the more complete Attainment of the Object proposed.

The present additional Article shall have the same Force and Effect as if it were inserted Word for Word in the Treaty signed on this Day; and it shall be ratified, and the Ratifications shall be exchanged, within the Term of Two Months from the Date of its Signature, or sooner, if possible.

In witness whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed it, and have affixed thereto the Seal of their Arms.

Each of the Two High Contracting Parties shall name a Commissioner and an Arbitrator, who shall be authorized to hear and to decide, without Appeal, all Cases of the Capture or Detention of Vessels which, in pursuance of the Stipulations of the aforesaid Treaty, shall be brought before them. The Commissioners and the Arbitrators shall, before entering upon the Duties of their Office, respectively make Oath before the principal Magistrate of the Places in which such Commissions respectively shall reside, that they will adjudge fairly and faithfully, that they will have no Preference either for the Claimants or the Captors, and that they will act in all their Decisions in pursuance of the Stipulations of the aforesaid Treaty.

There shall be attached to each of such Commissions a Secretary or Registrar, who shall be appointed by the Sovereign in whose Territories such Commission shall reside. Such Secretary or Registrar shall register all the Acts of such Commission, and shall, previously to entering upon his Office, make Oath before the Commission to which he is appointed, that he will conduct himself with due Respect for its Authority, and will act with Fidelity and Impartiality in all Matters relating to his said Office.

These Commissions shall judge definitively, and without Appeal, all Questions which shall arise out of the Capture and Detention of such Vessels.

The Proceedings of these Commissions shall take place with as little Delay as possible, and for this Purpose the Commissions are required to decide each Case, as far as may be practicable, within the Space of Twenty Days, to be counted from the Day on which the detained Vessel shall be brought into the Port where the deciding Commission shall reside.

The final Sentence shall not in any Case be delayed beyond the Period of Two Months, either on account of the Absence of Witnesses, or for any other Cause, except upon the Application of any of the Parties interested, in which Case, upon such Party or Parties giving satisfactory Security that they will take upon themselves the Expence and Risk of the Delay, the Commissions may, at their Discretion, grant an additional Delay, not exceeding Four Months.

Either Party shall be allowed to employ such Counsel as he may think fit, to assist him in the Conduct of his Cause.

In the event of the Two Commissioners not agreeing as to the Sentence which they ought to pronounce in any Case brought before them, either with respect to the Legality of the Detention, the Liability of the Vessel to Condemnation, or the Indemnification to be allowed, or as to any other Question which may arise out of the said Capture, or if any Difference of Opinion should arise between them as to the Mode of proceeding in the said Commission, they shall draw by Lot the Name of one of the Two Arbitrators so appointed as aforesaid, which Arbitrator, after having considered the Proceedings which have taken place, shall consult with the Two above-mentioned Commissioners, and the final Sentence or Decision shall be pronounced conformably to the Opinion of the Majority of the Three.

The Captor himself, and in his Default his Government, shall remain responsible for the Damages to which the Master of such Vessel, or the Owners of the Vessel or of her Cargo, may be pronounced to be entitled.

The Two High Contracting Parties bind themselves to pay, within the Term of a Year from the Date of the Sentence, the Costs and Damages which may be awarded by the above-mentioned Commission, it being mutually understood and agreed that such Costs and Damages shall be made good by the Government of the Country of which the Captor shall be a Subject.

Article VI.—If the detained Vessel shall be condemned she shall be declared lawful Prize, together with her Cargo, of whatever Description it may be, with the Exception of the Negroes or others who shall have been brought on board for the Purpose of being consigned to Slavery; and the said Vessel, in conformity with the Regulations in Article XI. of the Treaty of this Date, shall, as well as her Cargo, be sold by public Sale for the Profit of the Two Governments, subject to the Payment of the Expences herein-befbre mentioned.

The Slaves shall receive from the Commission a Certificate of Emancipation, and shall be delivered over to the Government to whom belongs the Cruiser which made the Capture, to be dealt with according to the Regulations and Conditions contained in the Annex to this Treaty marked (C.)

Article VII.—The Mixed Commissions shall also take cognizance of, and shall decide definitively, and without Appeal, all Claims for Compensation on account of Losses occasioned to Vessels and Cargoes which shall have been detained under the Provisions of this Treaty, but which shall not have been condemned as legal Prize by the said Commissions; and in all Cases wherein Restitution of such Vessels and Cargoes shall be decreed, save as mentioned in Article X. of the Treaty to which these Regulations form an Annex, and in a subsequent Part of these Regulations, the Commissions shall award to the Claimant or Claimants, or to his or their lawful Attorney or Attornies, for his or their Use, a just and complete Indemnification for all Costs of Suit, and for all Losses and Damages which the Owner or Owners may have actually sustained by such Capture and Detention; (that is to say,)

And whereas within the British Colonies in which, in pursuance of the said Treaty, Mixed Commissions have been established, there are already in force, or may be hereafter enacted, Laws or Regulations having the Force of Law better adapted for the Purpose aforesaid, and the Maintenance of such Laws or Regulations would therefore be more in accordance with the salutary End which the Two High Contracting Parties have in view:

It is equally agreed that the Mixed Commissions established in the Colonial Dominions of either of the Two High Contracting Parties, in virtue of the aforesaid Treaty, shall be empowered with full Authority to admit in future similar Substitutions in the Case of any Laws or Regulations having the Force of Law being hereafter enacted in the Colonies of Her Britannic Majesty or in the Colonies of Her most Faithful Majesty better adapted to guarantee the Liberty and insure the Welfare of the liberated Negroes in the said Colonies.

Any such Laws or Regulations having the Force of Law by which any of the Regulations of Annex (C.) shall be superseded under this Article shall be duly communicated, as the Case may be, by the one to the other of the High Contracting Parties.

The present additional Article shall have the same Force and Validity as if it had been inserted Word for Word in the aforesaid Treaty of the Third Day of July One thousand eight hundred and forty-two.

It shall be ratified, and the Ratifications thereof shall be exchanged at Lisbon, at the Expiration of Six Weeks from the Date of its Signature, or sooner, if possible.

[22d August 1843.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the Session of Parliament holden in the Third and Fourth Years of the Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act for the 3 & 4 Vict.

of Municipal Corporations in Ireland: And whereas another Act was c* 108. s. 20. passed in the same Session of Parliament, intituled An Act to annex S & * Vict. certain Parts of certain Counties of Cities to adjoining Counties; to c*109, make further Provision for Compensation of Officers in Boroughs; to limit the Borough Rate; and to continue for a limited Time an Act to restrain the Alienation of Corporate Property in Ireland: And whereas under the said recited Acts certain Parts or Portions of the old Liberties of certain Counties of Cities and Counties of Towns, and certain Parts of Parishes and other Denominations thereof, are included within the Boundaries of the Counties of such Cities or Towns as defined under the Provisions of the said recited Acts, and other Parts or Portions of the Liberties of the same Cities or Towns, and of such Parishes and other Denominations thereof, not being within such Boundaries, have for the Purposes of Grand Jury Pre-8 R sentments,

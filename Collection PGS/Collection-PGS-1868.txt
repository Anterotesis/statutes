‘ YI/TIEREAS it is judged necessary for the Safety of the United Kingdom, and the ‘ " Defence of the Possessions of this Realm, that a Body of Royal Marine Forces 4 should be employed in Her Majesty's Fleet and Naval Service, under the Direction 4 of the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom, or the Commissioners for executing 4 the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid: And whereas the said Forces may frequently 4 be quartered or be on shore, or sent to do Duty or be on board Transport Ships or 4 Merchant Ships or Vessels, or Ships or Vessels of Her Majesty, or other Ships or Vessels,

‘ or they may be under other Circumstances in which they will not be subject to the Laws 4 relating to the Government of Her Majesty's Forces by Sea: And whereas no Man can 4 be forejudged of Life or Limb, or subjected in Time of Peace to any Kind of Punishment 4 within this Realm, by Martial Law, or in any other Manner than by the Judgment of 4 his Peers, and according to the known and established Laws of this Realm; yet nevertheless it being requisite for the retaining of such Forces in their Duty that an exact 4 Discipline be observed, and that Marines who shall mutiny or stir up Sedition, or 4 shall desert Her Majesty's Service, or be guilty of any other Crime or Offence in 4 breach of or to the Prejudice of good Order and Discipline, be brought to a more 4 exemplary and speedy Punishment than the usual Forms of the Law will allow:' Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

1. It shall be lawful for the said Lord High Admiral, or the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, from Time to Time to make, ordain, alter, and establish Rules and Articles of War, under the Hand of the said Lord High Admiral, or under the Hands of any Two or more of the said Commissioners, for the better Government of Her Majesty's Royal Marine Forces, and for the Punishment of Mutiny, Desertion, Immorality, Breach of Discipline, Misbehaviour, Neglect of Duty, and any other Offence or Misconduct of which they shall be guilty, in any Place on shore or afloat in or out of Her Majesty's Dominions, or at any Time when or under any Circumstances in which they shall not be amenable to the Laws for the Government of Her Majesty's Ships, Vessels, and Forces by Sea, and for regulating the Proceedings of Courts-martial, which Rules and Articles shall be judicially taken notice of by all Judges and in all Courts whatsoever; and Copies of the same shall, as soon as conveniently may be after the same shall have been made, be transmitted by the Secretary of the Admiralty for the Time being (certified under his Hand) to the Judges of Her Majesty's Superior Courts at Westminster, Dublin, and Edinburgh respectively, and also to the Governors of Her Majesty's Dominions abroad; provided that no Person within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland or within the British Isles shall by such Articles of War be subject to suffer any Punishment extending to Life or Limb, or to be kept in Penal Servitude, except for Crimes which are by this Act expressly made liable to such Punishment as aforesaid, or shall be subject, with reference to any Crimes made punishable by this Act, to be punished in any Manner which may be inconsistent with the Provisions of this Act.

2. All Crimes and Offences committed against any former Act made for the Regulation of the Royal Marine Forces while on shore, or against any of the Rules, Regulations, or Articles of War made and established by virtue of the same, may, during the Continuance of this Act, be tried, inquired of, and punished in like Manner as if they had been committed against this Act; and every Warrant for holding any Court-martial under any former Act shall remain in full Force notwithstanding the Expiration of such Act: and all Proceedings of any Court-martial upon any Trial begun under the Authority of such former Act shall not be discontinued by the Expiration of the same: Provided always, that no Person shall be liable to be tried and punished for any Offence against any of the said Acts or Articles of War which shall appear to have been committed more than

FIRST SCHEDULE.

Convention between Her Majesty and the Emperor of the French, relative to Fisheries in the Seas between Great Britain and France.

Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Majesty the Emperor of the French, having charged a Mixed Commission with preparing a revision of the Convention of the 2nd of August 1839, and of the Regulation of June 23, 1843, relative to the fisheries in the seas situated between Great Britain and France; and the members of that Commission having agreed upon certain arrangements which experience has shown would be useful, and which appear to them such as will advantageously modify and complete the former arrangements in the common interest of the fishermen of the two countries; their said Majesties have judged it expedient that the arrangements proposed by the said Commission should be sanctioned by a new Convention, and have for that purpose named as their Plenipotentiaries, that is to say,

Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Right Honourable Richard Bickerton Pemell, Lord Lyons, a Peer of the United Kingdom, a Member of Her Britannic Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, Knight Grand Cross of the most Honourable Order of the Bath, Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to His Majesty the Emperor of the French;

And His Majesty the Emperor of the French, Leonel, Marquis de Moustier, Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of the Legion of Honour, &c. &c. &c., His Minister and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs;

Who, after having communicated to each other their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles:—

Article I.

British fishermen shall enjoy the exclusive right of fishery within the distance of three miles from low-water mark, along the whole extent of the coasts of the British islands; and French fishermen shall enjoy the exclusive right of fishery within the distance of three miles from low-water mark along the whole extent of the coast of France; the only exception to this rule being that part of the coast of France which lies between Cape Carteret and Point Meinga.

The distance of three miles fixed as the general limit for the exclusive right of fishery upon the coasts of the two countries shall, with respect to bays, the mouths of which do not exceed ten miles in width, be measured from a straight line drawn from headland to headland.

The miles mentioned in the present Convention are geographical miles, whereof sixty make a degree of latitude.

Article II.

SCHEDULE referred to in the foregoing Act.

Treasury Minute, dated August 15, 1856.

My Lords have under their Consideration several Memorials, signed by Persons interested in the Communication between the North of Ireland and Scotland, and praying that their Lordships will take Measures to determine the Ports best adapted for the Establishment of a short Sea Passage between the Two Countries, with a view to promote the quickest Postal and Passenger Communication.

One of these Memorials prays for a public Loan to the County Down Railway Company, in order to enable them to complete their Line to Donaghadee.

Fully recognizing the great Advantages which would be derived by the extensive Manufacturing Districts in the North of Ireland, in the West of Scotland, and in the North of England, by establishing a Communication between the Two Ports which should reduce the Sea Passage to the shortest possible Time, and in connexion with a System of Railways on both Sides, which to a certain Extent already exists and the

Completion

330

31° & 32° VICTORIA, c.81.

Completion of which my Lords understand is in contemplation, by which a direct Communication will be opened between all the above important Districts, my Lords referred the Subject to the Admiralty, for their Lordships Opinion upon the nautical Questions raised in the Memorials.

My Lords have now before them the Reply of the Admiralty, in which the Lords Commissioners report, that the most favourable Ports for the Establishment of a short Sea Passage are those of Portpatrick and Donaghadee; and they suggest that Instructions should be given to them to institute an Inquiry as to the best and cheapest Manner in which those Ports may be made suitable for the Purpose. These Instructions my Lords have already issued.

Before any Expense, however, is incurred, it becomes necessary that my Lords should clearly state their Views upon the Subject, for the Information of all the Parties who have appeared before them, either by Memorial or by personal Application, and of others who take an Interest in it.

It has been represented to my Lords that in the event of the Government deciding upon the best Ports for the Passage referred to, and especially in the Case of Portpatrick and Donaghadee being adopted, and provided the Government should be willing to use it as a Mail Communication, that, in the first place, a Steam Boat Service, suited both for Passengers and Mails, would be established by a private Company, without any Aid from the Government except a fair Price for carrying the Mails; and that, in the second place, the Railways on each Side of the Channel would be completed so as to connect Donaghadee on the one Side with Belfast and the Main Line, and Portpatrick on the other Side with Glasgow to the North, and with Dumfries to the East, by which all the important Objects in view would be fully attained. All this, it has been understood, will be performed by private Enterprise, if only the Government, on its Part, will—

1. Determine the Ports most suitable for the Service.

2. Adopt the Line between such Ports as a Mail Passage.

3. Make such Improvements in the Ports as shall best fit them for the Purpose.

These Conditions my Lords are prepare to adopt. They have already, upon the Advice

of the Admiralty, decided that the best Ports will be Portpatrick and Donaghadee, and have instructed the Lords Commissioners to report upon the Improvements and Alterations required to render them suitable for the Service, and when a Steam Service shall be established for carrying the Mails they will be prepared to use it for that Purpose upon fair and reasonable Terms.

But, before my Lords proceed actually to incur any Expense upon the Ports named for their Improvement in pursuance of any Report that may be made by the Admiralty, it will be quite necessary that they should be well satisfied that all the Arrangements herein referred to, and which would be necessary to give public Utility to the Scheme, will be completed.

With regard to the Memorials for Aid in completing the Railways by a public Loan there is no Fund disposable for such a Purpose except that annually voted by Parliament for Public Works and administered under this Board by Commissioners appointed for the Purpose. It will, therefore, be necessary for those requiring such a Loan to apply to the Public Loan Commissioners, with whom rests the Responsibility of judging of the Security to be accepted in such Cases, and who alone can determine how far the other Demands upon the Fund at their Disposal will enable them to entertain the Requests.

Let a Copy of this Minute be forwarded to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, to the Chamber of Commerce, Belfast, to the other Memorialists, and to the Postmaster General.

An Act to simplify the Form and diminish the Expense of obtaining Infeftment in Heritable Property in Scotland. [21st July 1845.]

Whereas it is expedient to simplify the Form and diminish the Expense of obtaining Infeftment in Heritable Property in Scotland: Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same. That from and after the First Day of October in the present Tear One thousand eight hundred and forty-five it shall not be necessary to proceed to the Lands in which Sasine is to be given, or to perform any Act of Infeftment thereon, but Sasine shall be effectually given therein and Infeftment obtained by producing to a Notary Public the Warrants of Sasine and relative Writs, as now in use to be produced at taking Infeftment, and by expeding and recording in the General Register of Sasines, or the Particular Register of Sasines applicable to the Lands contained in the Warrant of Infeftment, in manner herein-after directed, an Instrument of Sasine setting forth that Sasine had been given in the said Lands, and subscribed by the said Notary Public and Witnesses, according to the Form and as nearly as may be in the Terms of Schedule (B.) hereto annexed; and such Form of Infeftment shall be effectual, whether the Lands lie contiguous or discontiguous, or are held by the same or by different Titles, or of One or more Superiors, or whether the Deed entitling the Party to obtain Infeftment be dated prior or subsequent to the present Act, or whether the Precept of Sasine therein be in the Form heretofore in use, or in the Form authorized by the present Act.

II. And be it enacted. That from and after the said First Day of October every such Instrument of Sasine shall be recorded in manner heretofore in use with regard to Instruments of Sasine, and the Keepers of the Registers of Sasines are hereby required to receive and register the same accordingly; and such Instrument of Sasine, being so recorded, shall in all respects have the same Effect as if Sasine had been taken and an Instrument of Sasine duly recorded according to the Law and Practice heretofore in use.

III. And be it enacted, That from and after the said First Day of October every such Instrument of Sasine may be competently and effectually recorded at any Time during the Life of the Party in whose Favour such Instrument has been expede, but the Date of Presentment and Entry set forth on any such Instrument by the Keeper of the Record shall be taken to be the Date of the Instrument of Sasine and Infeftment.

IV. And be it enacted. That in case of any Error or Defect in any such Instrument of Sasine, or in the recording thereof, it shall be competent of new to make and record an Instrument of Sasine, which shall have Effect from the Date of the recording thereof, as if no previous Instrument or Instruments had been made or recorded.

Y. And be it enacted, That in all Deeds containing a Precept of Sasine such Precept may be in the Form and as nearly as may be in the Terms of the Schedule (A.) hereto annexed, and the Instrument of Sasine on any such Deed shall be in the Form and as nearly as may be in the Terms of the said Schedule (B.) hereto annexed, which Precepts and Instruments of Sasine respectively shall be as valid and effectual as the Precepts and Instruments of Sasine heretofore in use.

VI. And be it enacted, That where Infeftment is to be completed under a PrecepP issuing from the Office of Chancery, which Precept has hitherto been directed to the Sheriff of the County in which the Lands or some Part thereof lie, such Precept shall, after the said First Day of October, be addressed to any Notary Public: Provided always, that such Precept shall be null and void unless an Instrument of Sasine thereon be recorded in the General Register of Sasines, or the Register of Sasines applicable to (the Lands therein contained, before the first Term of Whitsunday or Martinmas posterior to the Date of such Precept, without Prejudice to a new Precept being issued as heretofore, and that before such Precept is issued from Chancery the Retour Duties and

Casualties

to

Repealed by this Act.

475

31° & 32* VICTORIA, c. 101.

Casualties due to the Crown shall be paid to the proper Officer there, who shall account to the Exchequer for the same in like Manner as the Sheriffs were wont to do; and the same Officer shall also receive at the same Time certain Fees on behalf of the Sheriffs, Sheriffs Substitute, and Sheriff Clerks of the Counties in which the Lands lie, and on which Sasine wouH have been taken according to the Form heretofore in use, and to whom such Officer shall account for the same, in place of the Fees which they have heretofore been in use to receive, but such Fees shall be paid only during the Existence of the respective Interests of the present Sheriffs, Sheriffs Substitute, and Sheriff Clerks in their respective Offices; and the Lords of Council and Session are hereby authorized and required, by an Act or Acts of Sederunt, to regulate and determine the Amount of the Fees to be so received on behalf of each Sheriff, Sheriff Substitute, and Sheriff Clerk, having due Regard to the existing Interest of each.

VII. And whereas it is not hereby intended to make any Alterations in the Law with regard to Instruments of Sasine and Instruments of Cognition, and Sasine of Subjects held Burgage, or by any similar Mode of Tenure known and effectual in Law, excepting as after specified; be it enacted, That the Forms and Modes of Registration of these Instruments shall continue the same as at present, excepting only that the same shall be valid and effectual, if attested by the Town Clerk as a Notary, without the Addition of his Docquet, and by the Witnesses, and that the Delivery of Symbols may lawfully be given, either on the Ground of the Subjects as heretofore, or within the Council Chamber of the Burgh by Delivery of a Pen.

VIII. And be it enacted, That Instruments of Resignation ad remanentiam shall be written in the same Form as at present, but it shall be unnecessary for the Notary Public to adhibit his long Docquet to such Instruments; and further, that all Resignations ad remanentiam may be accepted by the Superior himself, or on his Behalf, by his known Agent for the Time, or by any Person having a formal Commission for that Purpose.

IX. And whereas Instruments of Resignation in favorem, as separate Instruments intended merely to connect the Procuratory with the Charter of Resignation, are now rarely used in Practice, and are wholly unnecessary; be it enacted, That from and after the said First Day of October the same shall be and are hereby abolished: Provided always, that the Deduction of Titles required by the Act of the Parliament of Scotland made in the Year One thousand six hundred and ninety-three, intituled " Act anent Pro-" curatories of Resignation and Precepts of Seisin," to be made in such Instruments, shall from and after the Date of this Act be made in the Charter of Resignation.

X. And be it enacted, That in the Construction of this Act the Words " Notary Public " shall be held to mean a Notary Public in Scotland duly admitted and practising there; the Word " Deed " shall be held to include any Warrant or Document upon which Sasine may follow; and the Word "Lands," or the Words "Heritable Property," shall be held to include Houses, Fishings, Mills, Minerals, Patronages, Teinds, and in general all Heritable Subjects or Rights in which Infeffcment may be taken; and all Words in the Singular Number shall be held to include a Plurality of Persons or Things; and in general this Act shall be construed in the most liberal Manner, so as to accomplish the Objects thereby intended.

XI. And be it enacted, That this Act may be amended or repealed by any Act to be passed in the present Session of Parliament.

31° & 32® VICTORIA, c. 123.

hereby make the following General Regulations with respect to the Construction and Use of Cruives :—

I. The upper Surface of the Sill of each Cruive shall be not higher than Twelve Inches above the natural Bed of the River where the Cruive is placed, and in the event of the Sill being placed any higher than the natural Bed of the River there must be a paved Floor or Apron to it down Stream at least as wide as the Cruive, having its lower End not higher than the natural Level of the River, and having a Slope not steeper than One In Six; and otherwise the Cruives shall be so constructed as to afford a ready and easy Passage for the Fish during the Annual and Weekly Close Times.

II. No Cruive shall be less at any Part of it than Four Feet broad in the Clear; provided that where an upright Post is used to support the Cruive, thereby dividing the Width into Two Parts, the aggregate Width exclusive of such Post shall not be less than Four Feet.

IIL The Hecks or Rails and Inscales shall be capable of being removed from the Cruive, and shall be removed during the Annual Close Time. During the Weekly Close Time the Hecks or Rails shall be removed, and the Inscales shall either be removed or kept open for the Space of Four Feet.

IV. The Bars of the upper Hecks or Rails shall be placed perpendicularly, not less

than Three Inches apart, and they shall not be more than Two Inches thick, and not more than Four Inches broad in the up and down Way of the Stream, and they shall have their Edges rounded off, so that only Inches in Breadth of the whole Thickness of Two Inches shall remain in the Side of the Hecks or Rails in the up and down Way of the Stream. _

V. The Bars of the Inscales shall not be of larger Dimensions than those of the Hecks or Rails, and they shall not be less than Two Inches apart.

VI. Each Side or Half of the Inscales shall not be less than Three Feet long for a Cruive Four Feet wide in the Clear, and shall be longer in the same Proportion to any additional Width of Cruive. They shall be constructed so that the Up Stream Ends cannot and shall not at any Time approach nearer to each other than Five Inches.

VII. No Net or other Contrivance whatever shall be placed or used on or at any Cruive, or Structure connected with a Cruive, for the Purpose of catching Fish, or for preventing their Entry into or passing through the same; nor shall any Device be employed to scare, deter, or obstruct Fish from entering into or passing through any such Cruive. But, notwithstanding anything herein contained, it shall be lawful to place a Canvas Cloth or a Wooden Blind or Blinds over the Heck or Hecks of a Cruive whilst the Fish are being taken out of it, provided such Cloth, Blind or Blinds, be not applied longer than Fifteen Minutes at a Time, or oftener than Six Times in the Course of Twenty-four Hours, and that when there are more Cruives than One at the same Dam only One Cruive shall be covered by the Cloth or Blinds at the same Time.

VIII. No Cruive shall be so constructed, inclosed, roofed, or built over, or in any other Manner hidden or fenced in, as to prevent Persons duly authorized from inspecting the same at all Times, and ascertaining whether the Law is being duly complied with.

IX. No Cruive shall be so altered as to create a greater Obstruction to the free Passage of Fish than at present exists.

" Acts to regulate and amend the Law respecting the Salmon Fisheries of Scotland."

We, the Commissioners appointed under the said Acts, and empowered thereby " to make " General Regulations with respect to the Construction and Alteration of Mill Dams or " Lades, or Water Wheels, so as to afford a reasonable Means for the Passage of Salmon," do hereby make the following General Regulations with respect to the Construction and Use of Mill Dams or Lades, or Water Wheels:—

1. Every new Dam, and every Portion of any Dam that may require to be renewed or repaired after this Time, shall be made and maintained Water-tight, or as nearly so as possible, so that no Water that can reasonably be prevented shall run through the Dam; but all Water not taken into the Lade for the Use of the Mills or other lawful Purpose shall be made to flow over the Dam as fully as may be practicable.

2. There shall be a Sluice or Sluices at the Intake of every Mill Lade. No Water shall, with the Exception herein-after stated, be allowed to enter any Mill Lade beyond the Quantity required for the Use of the Water Wheel or Wheels of any One Fall on that Lade, or for other lawful Purpose in the Lade; that is to say, no Water shall be allowed to escape from any Lade into the River by means of any Bye-wash or Overflow, but all Water not required for the Uses aforesaid shall be made to flow over the Dam into the River as far as may be practicable.

At the Option of the Millers or Manufacturers, this Provision may be carried out either by shutting the Sluice or Sluices at the Intake of the Lade, or by raising the Banks of the Lade to a Height that will prevent an Overflow of Water from the Lade when the Sluice at the Wheel and the Bye-wash Sluice herein-after mentioned are both kept shut. Provided always, that the said Byelaw shall not apply to Millers or Manufacturers when taking Measures necessary for the Protection of their Premises during heavy Floods, or when Rivera are cumbered with Ice, or while necessary Repairs are being executed on any Emergency; provided that nothing be omitted or done unnecessarily to defeat the Objects of this Byelaw. Furthermore, in all Cases when the Intake Sluice is more than 300 Yards from the Water Wheel, it shall not be imperative to shut the Intake Sluice, or to keep the Bye-wash Sluice shut, during ordinary Meal Hours, or during any Stoppage of the Wheel not exceeding an Hour at a Time.

3. At the Intake of every Lade there shall be placed and constantly kept a Heck or Grating for each Opening, or One embracing the whole Openings, the Bars to be not more than Three Inches apart, if horizontal, and not more than Two Inches if vertical.

4. A similar Heck or Grating shall be placed and constantly kept across the Lade or Troughs immediately above the Entrance to each Mill Wheel.

5. A similar Heck or Grating shall be placed and constantly kept across the lower End of each Tail Lade at its Entrance into the Main River.

Note.—To prevent any Obstruction to the Flow of the Water by the Hecks or Gratings in the Lades, it is recommended that the Lade should be increased in Width where the Hecks are placed, and that the Heck, instead of being in a straight Line across, should be curved or pointed up or down Stream, and thereby increased in Length, so that the aggregate of the Openings between the Bara shall exceed the Sectional Area (or Waterway) of the Lade, and thus compensate for the Space occupied by the Bara.

6. There

31° & 32° VICTORIA, c. 123.

6. There shall be a Bye-wash Sluice placed as near as practicable above each Water Wheel in the Embankment of the Lade of not less than Three Feet in Width, with its Sill as low as the Bottom of the Lade, and the said Sluice shall be raised to a Height sufficient to allow the Smolts to descend for at Least Five but not exceeding Eight Hours each Week from the 15th March to the 1st July, not more than Six Days intervening between each Time of opening.

There shall be a Salmon Pass or Ladder on the Down Stream Face of every Dam, Weir, or Cauld, capable of affording a free Passage for the ascending Fish at all Times when there is Water enough in the River to supply the Ladder. The Width shall not be less than Four Feet in the Clear in Rivers of less than 100 Feet in Breadth at the Site of the Dam, nor less than Five Feet in Breadth in Rivers of less than 200 Feet and more than 100 Feet in Breadth as aforesaid, nor less than Six Feet in Breadth in Rivers of more than 200 Feet in Breadth as aforesaid; the Upper Sill shall be not less than Six Inches below the lowest Part of the Crest of the Dam for the whole Width of the Ladder; the Inclination shall in no Case be steeper than Five horizontal to One perpendicular, but, wherever practicable, shall be Seven or Eight horizontal to One perpendicular, and in all Cases shall be provided with Breaks or Stops placed at suitable Intervals, so as to lessen the Velocity of the Current sufficiently to allow the Fish to ascend without Difficulty.

The Foot of the Ladder shall be placed where there is most running Water, and with the best Lead for the Fish to approach it; and if the Ladder should project beyond the Toe of the Dam, there shall be an Apron of Stone formed to the Dam, extending as far down the River as the Entrance to the Pass or Ladder, and extending throughout the whole Length of the Dam at either Side of the Ladder, and on a high enough Level to prevent there being any Pool in the River, or sufficient Depth of Water farther up than the Entrance to the said Pass or Ladder, by which the Fish might be induced to remain there obstructed in their Ascent, and not be led to the Ladder.

Note.—The Commissioners would recommend the following Details to be adopted in the Construction of Salmon Ladders, in addition to those, given in the foregoing Byelaw, but do not insist on them, provided some other perfectly efficient Arrangement be substituted,—viz., the Side Walls to be not less than Twenty-two Inches in Height; the Breaks to be not less than Eighteen Inches in Height, with Openings of Ten Inches in Breadth at the alternate Ends of each Break, and Five Feet apart in Cases where the Gradient of the Ladder is One in Five and of a greater Distance, but the same Proportions being maintained where the Gradient is easier than One in Five.

7. No Dam shall be so altered as to create a greater Obstruction to the free Passage of Fish than at present exists.

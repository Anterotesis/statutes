WHEREAS by an Act of the Sixth and Seventh Years of the Reign of His late Majesty King William the Fourth, intituled An Act to consolidate and amend the Laws relating to the Presentment of Public Money by Grand Juries in Ireland, it is amongst other things provided, that the Grand Jury of each County in Ireland shall at each Assizes appoint a proper Person to be High Constable and Collector for each Barony in such County, to collect all Monies presented to be raised on such Barony, or a County of a City, or County of a Town, in manner therein particularly specified; and that if any such High Constable or Collector shall happen to die before he shall have collected the whole of the Money presented to be raised, or if any Case of Vacancy shall occur, it shall be lawful for the Justices of the Peace at any General Quarter Sessions, or Adjournment thereof, to appoint another Person to be High Constable or Collector pro tempore until a High Constable or Collector shall be appointed by the Grand Jury; and it is also provided that no Person shall act as High Constable or Collector unless he shall have given Security, as therein mentioned, at the Assizes before the Grand Jury by whom he shall have been appointed, or before the Justices of the Peace at the General Quarter Sessions, if he shall have been appointed at such Sessions, as therein in certain Cases provided; and on his producing the Treasurer's Certificate as therein mentioned it shall be lawful for the Grand Jury to present a Sum not exceeding Nine-pence in the Pound on the Amount of the Collection to be paid to such High Constable or Collector for his Trouble therein: And whereas it has sometimes happened that properly qualified Persons could not be duly appointed at the Assizes to act as High Con-

neglect

seeking to enforce an Order for the Removal of a poor Person

to the Overseers or Guardians of the Parish to which such s poor Person is intended to be removed, of a Copy of the ' Examination upon which such Order has been made, has been ' found to produce much expensive and useless Litigation upon ' Points of mere Form, so that few Cases of Appeals against

An Act for the Removal of Defects in the Administration of Criminal Justice.

[14th August 1848.]

WHEREAS the technical Strictness of Criminal Proceed- ' ? ings might in some Instances be further relaxed, so as to c ensure the Punishment of the Guilty, without depriving the

Accused of any just Means of Defence: And whereas it is

expedient to make further Provision for the more effectual ' Prosecution of Accessories before apd after the Fact to Felony: And whereas it is also expedient that any Accessory ' before the Fact to Felony should be liable to be indicted, tried, ' convicted, and punished in all respects like the Principal, as is

now the Case in Treason and in all Misdemeanors:9 Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act, if any Person shall become an Accessory before the Fact to any Felony, whether the same be a Felony at Common Law or by virtue of any Statute or Statutes made or to be made, such Person may be indicted, tried, convicted, and punished in all respects as if he were a principal Felon.

II. And whereas an Accessory after the Fact to Felony can

at present be tried only along with the principal Felon, or ' after the principal Felon has been convicted, and not otherwise, which is sometimes productive of a Failure of Justice:' Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, if any Person shall become an Accessory after the Fact to any Felony, whether the same be a Felony at Common Law or by virtue of any Statute or Statutes made or to be made, he may be indicted and convicted either as an Accessory after the Fact to the principal Felony together with the principal Felon,

or

or after the Conviction of the principal Felon, or may be indicted and convicted of a substantive Felony whether the principal Felon shall or shall not have been previously convicted or stall or shall not be amenable to Justice, and may thereupon be punished in like Manner as any Accessory after the Fact to the same Felony if convicted as an Accessory may be punished; and the Offence of such Person, howsoever indicted, may be inquired of, tried, determined, and punished by any Court which shall have Jurisdiction to try the principal Felon in the same Manner as if the Act by reason of which such Person shall have become an Accessory tad been committed at the same Place as the principal Felony: Provided always, that no Person who shall be once duly tried for any such Offence, whether as an Accessory after the Fact or as for a substantive Felony, shall be liable to be again indicted or tried for the same Offence.

III. And whereas, according to the present Practice of As to Additions ' Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, it is not permitted in an

Indictment for stealing Property to add a Count for receiving stealing and

the same Property knowing it to have been stolen, or in an receiving stolen ' Indictment for receiving stolen Property knowing it to have Proper *

' been stolen to add a Count for stealing the same Property, and ' Justice is hereby often defeatedBe it therefore enacted. That from and after the passing of this Act, in every Indictment for feloniously stealing Property it shall be lawful to add a Count for feloniously receiving the same Property knowing it to have been stolen, and in any Indictment for feloniously receiving Property knowing it to have been stolen it stall be lawful to add a Count for feloniously stealing the same Property; and where any such Indictment shall have been preferred and found against any Person, the Prosecutor shall not be put to his Election, but it shall be lawful for the Jury who shall try the same to find a Verdict of Guilty, either of stealing the Property or of receiving it knowing it to have been stolen; and if such Indictment shall have been preferred and found against Two or more Persons it shall be lawful for the Jury who shall try the same to find all or any of the said Persons guilty either of stealing the Property or of receiving it knowing it to have been stolen, or to find one or more of the said Persons guilty of stealing the Property, and the other or others of them guilty of receiving it knowing it to have been stolen.

IV. And whereas a Failure of Justice frequently takes Courts of Oyer place in Criminal Trials by reason of Variances between "d Terminer

An Act to authorize the Application of Part of the unclaimed Money in the Court for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors in enlarging the Court House of the said Court.

[31st August 1848.]

WHEREAS by an Act passed in the Second Year of the Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act for abolishing Arrest on Mesne Process in Civil Actions except in certain Cases, for extending the Remedies of Creditors against the Property of Debtors, and for amending the Laws for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors in England, after noticing that it might happen that Money might remain in the Court for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors, produced by the Estates and Effects of Insolvent Debtors who had taken the Benefit of that or some other Act for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors, which had not been or might not be claimed by the Assignees or Creditors of such Insolvents, it was enacted, that it should be lawful for the said Court to cause the same, or any Part thereof to be invested in Government Securities, and to apply the Interest and Profit arising therefrom towards defraying the Expenses of the said Court: Provided that no such Money should be so invested until the same should have been in the Hands of the said Court for Twelve Months at the least: And whereas the Sum of Sixty-seven thousand Pounds or thereabouts, remaining unclaimed in the said Court, has been invested in Exchequer Bills under the said recited Provision: And whereas by reason of recent Alterations in Jurisdiction, under which every Commissioner of the said Court for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors forms a Court, it has become necessary to enlarge the Court House in Portugal Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and for that Purpose to purchase and alter an adjoining Messuage and Buildings; and it is expedient that Part of the said unclaimed Monies should be applied in

CAP. CXVI.

An Act for carrying into effect the Treaty between Her Majesty and the Republic of the Equator for the Abolition of the Traffic in Slaves.

[4th September 1848.]

WHEREAS on the Twenty-fourth Day of Map in the Year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and forty-one

4 a Treaty was concluded and signed at Quito between Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Republic of the Equator, for the Abolition of the Traffic in Slaves, whereby it was agreed as follows:

Article I. — Great Britain and the Republic of the Equator declare the Traffic in Slaves abolished for ever; 4 and in order to avoid any Doubts that may hereafter occur from any Circumstance proving prejudicial to the Interests of Commerce and Navigation for Want of a proper Explanation of the real Spirit of the Phrase Traffic in Slaves," do here mutually declare to be understood by such Traffic such only which is carried on in Negroes brought from Africa in order to transport them to other Parts of the World for Sale, but in no Manner whatever the conveying from one Port or Place to another belonging to the Republic the Slaves existing within it, be such undertaken either with the Object of selling them or with any other not prohibited by the Laws.

Article II. — The Republic of the Equator agrees to treat as Pirates, and to punish with the Penalties which the existing penal Laws impose on Pirates, all such Equatorial who on the High Seas, or in any other Place under the Jurisdiction of the Republic, may be found embarking, transporting, or disembarking One or more Persons brought from Africa as Slaves.

Article III. — The Republic of the Equator will promulgate every other legislative Provision that may be deemed requisite for the Prevention of her Citizens engaging in any way in the said Traffic in Slaves, and for the complete Extinction thereof; seeing that the same are in harmony with those which may be promulgated by Great Britain for the like Object, and with the constitutional Principles of the Republic.

Article IV. — In order more completely to prevent all Infringement of the Spirit of the present Treaty, the High Contracting Parties mutually consent that those Ships of their respective Navies which shall be provided with special Instructions for that Purpose, as herein-after mentioned, may visit such Merchant Vessels of the Two Nations as may upon reasonable Grounds be suspected of being engaged in the Traffic in Slaves, or of having been fitted out for that Purpose, or of having, during the Voyage on which they are met by the said Cruisers, been engaged in the Traffic of Slaves, contrary to the Provisions of this Treaty; and that such Cruisers may detain and send or carry away such Vessels, in order that they be brought to Trial in the Manner herein-after agreed upon.

In order to fix the reciprocal Right of Search in such a Manner as shall be adapted to the Attainment of the Object of this Treaty, and at the same Time to avoid Doubts, Disputes, or Complaints, the Right of Search shall be understood in the Form and according to the Rules following: —

4 First, — It shall never be exercised except by Vessels of War authorized expressly for that Object, according to the Stipulations of this Treaty.

4 Secondly, — In no Case shall the Right of Search be exercised with respect to a Vessel of the Royal or National Navy of either of the Two Powers, but only as regards Merchant Vessels.

4 Thirdly, — Whenever a Merchant Vessel is searched

by a Ship of War, the Commander of the said Ship shall, in the Act of so doing, exhibit to the Commander of the Merchant Vessel the Document by which he is ' duly authorized to that end, and shall deliver to him a 4 Certificate, signed by him, stating his Rank in the Naval Service of his Country, and the Name of the

4 Vessel

984 '

Cap. 116. Slave Trade (Equator). 11 & 12 Vict.

4 Vessel he commands, and which also declares that the only Object of the Search is to ascertain whether the Vessel is employed in the Slave Trade, or if it is fitted up for the said Traffic. When the Search is made by an Officer of the Cruiser who is not the Com-

mander, the said Officer shall exhibit to the Captain of the Merchant Vessel a Copy of the before-mentioned special Orders, signed by the Commander of the Cruiser, and in like Manner deliver a Certificate signed

by him stating his Rank in the Navy, the Name of the Commander by whose Orders he proceeds to make the Search, that of the Cruiser in which he sails, and the Object of the Search, as has been already laid down.

4 If it appears from the Search that the Papers of the Vessel are in regular Order, and that it is employed on licit Objects, the Officer shall then enter in the Logbook of the Vessel that the Search has been made in pursuance of the aforesaid special Orders, and the Vessel shall be left at liberty to pursue its Voyage.

4 The Rank of the Officer who makes the Search must not be less than that of Lieutenant of the Royal or National Navy, unless the Command, either by reason of Death or other Cause, is at the Time held by an Officer of inferior Rank.

Article V. — In order to regulate the Mode of carrying the Provisions of the preceding Article into execution it is agreed, —

4 First, — That all the Ships of the respective Navies of the Two Nations which shall be hereafter employed to prevent the Traffic in Slaves shall be furnished by their respective Governments with a Copy, in the English and Spanish Languages, of the present Treaty, 4 of the Instructions for Cruisers annexed thereto marked 4 A., and of the Regulations for the mixed Courts of Justice annexed thereto, marked B., which Annexes respectively shall be considered as integral Parts of the Treaty.

4 Secondly, — That each of the High Contracting Parties shall from Time to Time communicate to the other the Names of the several Ships furnished with such Instructions, the Force of each, and the Names of their several Commanders. The said Commanders ought to hold the Rank of Captain in the Navy, or at least of Lieutenant; it being nevertheless understood that the Instructions originally issued to an Officer holding the Rank of Lieutenant of the Navy or other superior Rank shall be sufficient, in case of Death or temporary Absence of the same, to authorise the Officer on whom the Command of the Vessel has devolved to make the Search, although the said Officer may not hold the aforesaid Rank in the Service.

4 Thirdly, —

1848.

985

Slave Trade (Equator). Cap. 116.

4 Thirdly, — That if at any Time the Commander of a 4 Cruiser of either of the Two Nations shall suspect that any Merchant Vessel under the Escort or Convoy of any Ship or Ships of War of the other Nation carries Slaves on board, or has been engaged in the Traffic of Slaves, or is fitted out for the Purjjose thereof, the said Commander of the Cruiser shall communicate his Suspicions to the Commander of the Convoy, who,

4 accompanied by the Commander of the Cruiser, shall proceed to the Search of the suspected Vessel; and in case that the Suspicions appear well founded, according to the Tenor of this Treaty, then the said Vessel shall be conducted or sent to One of the Points where the mixed Courts of Justice are stationed, in order that the just Sentence may there be pronounced.

4 Fourthly, — It is further mutually agreed, that the Commanders of the Ships of the Two Navies respectively who shall be employed on this Service shall adhere strictly to the exact Tenor of the aforesaid Instructions.

Article VI. — As the Two preceding Articles are entirely reciprocal, the Two High Contracting Parties engage mutually to make good any Losses which their respective Subjects may incur by the arbitrary and illegal Detention of their Vessels; it being understood that this Indemnity shall be borne by the Government whose Cruiser shall have been guilty of such arbitrary and illegal Detention, and that the Visit and Detention of Vessels specified in the Fourth Article of this Treaty shall only be effected by those British and Equatorian Ships which may form Part of the Two respective Navies, and by such of those Ships only as are provided with the special Instructions annexed to the present Treaty, in pursuance of the Provisions thereof. The Indemnification for the Damage of which this Article treats shall be made within the Term of One Year, reckoning from the Day in which the Mixed Court of Justice pronounces its Sentence on the Vessel for the Detention of which such Compensation is claimed.

Article VII. — In order to bring to Adjudication with as little Delay and Inconvenience as possible the Vessels which may be detained according to the Tenor of the Fourth Article of this Treaty, there shall be established, as soon as may be practicable, Two Mixed Courts of Justice, formed of an equal Number of Indi *

4 viduals of the Two Nations, and named for this Purpose by their respective Governments.

4 These Courts shall reside, one in a Possession belonging to Her Britannic Majesty, the other within the Territory of the Equatorian Republic; and at the Period of the

4 Exchange

116.

Slave Trade (Equator). 11 & 12 VICT.

Exchange of the Ratifications of the present Treaty the Two Governments shall declare, each for its own Dk>minions, in what Place these Courts shall respectively reside.

But each of the Two High Contracting Parties reserves to itself the Right of changing at its Pleasure the Place of Residence of the Court held within its own Dominions; Provided always, that one of the Courts shall be held upon the Coast of Africa, and the other in some Part of the Territory of the Equator.

And these Courts, from which there shall be no Appeal, shall judge the Causes submitted to them according to the Provisions of the present Treaty, and according to the Regulations and Instructions which are annexed to the present Treaty, and which are considered as integral Parts thereof.

Article VIII. — In case the Commanding Officer of any of the Ships of the respective Navies of Great Britain and the Equator, duly commissioned according to the Provisions of Article IV. of this Treaty, shall deviate in any respect from the Stipulations of the said Treaty or the Instructions annexed to it, the Government which shall conceive itself to be wronged thereby shall be entitled to demand Reparation, and in such Case the Government to which such Commanding Officer may belong binds itself to cause Inquiry to be made into the Subject of the Complaint, and to inflict upon the said Officer a Punishment proportioned to any wilful Transgression which be may have committed.

Article IX. — It is hereby further mutually agreed, that every Merchant Vessel, British or Equatorial^ which shall be visited by virtue of the present Treaty, may lawfully lie detained, and sent or brought before the Mixed Courts of Justice established in pursuance of the Provisions thereof, if in her Equipment there shall be found any of the Things herein-after mentioned; namely,

4 First, — Hatches with open Gratings, instead of the close Hatches which are usual in Merchant Vessels.

4 Second, — Divisions or Bulkheads in the Hold or on Deck in greater Number than are necessary for Vessels engaged in lawful Trade.

4 Third, — Spare Planks fitted for laying down a 4 Second or Slaves Deck.

4 Fourth, — Shackels, Bolts, or Handcuffs.

4 Fifth, — A larger Quantity of Water in Casks or in Tanks than is requisite for the Consumption of the Crew of the Vessel as a Merchant Vessel.

4 Sixth, — An extraordinary Number of Water Casks,

or of other Vessels for holding Liquid, unless the Matter shall produce a Certificate from the Custom House

1 at

1848.

987

Slave Trade (Equator). Cap. 116.

4 at the Place from which he cleared Outwards, stating that a sufficient Security had been given by the Owners of such Vessel that such extra Quantity of Casks or other Vessels should only be used to hold Palm Oil, or for other Purposes of lawful Commerce.

4 Monies were applicable under the Provisions of the Acts authorizing such Charges, and other Acts therein referred to, and notwithstanding anything in the same Acts or any of them contained; provided nevertheless, that it should not be lawful

called Victoria Streety and so as such Expenditure were shown

to have been made in respect of the procuring the Land for the Area of the Street, or as near thereto as in the Opinion of the said Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods the Boun-

daries of the Properties to be purchased would allow, and of the Payment of Expenses relating to such Purchases, not exceeding Twelve Pounds per Centum on the Amount of the Purchase Monies, and so as such Expenditure were shown to have been made out of Monies belonging to the said West* 4 minster Improvement Commissioners, or Monies raised by a 4 Charge on the surplus Profits to arise on the Completion of the said Undertaking, or otherwise on the Credit of the Bonds

or Debentures of the said last-named Commissioners, and so as no Part thereof should consist of Monies raised by means of any Charge on the said Sum of Thirty-nine thousand Pounds and Interest so to be advanced to the said Westminster Improvement Commissioners as aforesaid, or on the Monies by the said Westminster Improvement Act, 1847, authorized to be paid to the said Improvement Commissioners out of or in respect of certain increased Bates therein mentioned; and it was by the Act now in recital further enacted, that before any Part of the said Sum of Fifty thousand Pounds should be paid to the Westminster Improvement Commissioners the said Westminster Improvement Commissioners should deposit with the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods for the Time being the Conveyances of all the Lands and Hereditaments which should have been purchased by the said Westminster Improvement Commissioners, under the Provisions of the said Acts,

4 1845, and the Westminster Improvement Act, 1847, and all the Title Deeds relating thereto which should be in their Possession, such Deeds to remain with the said Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods for the Time being until the said Street, [No. 68. Price 2c/.] 3 Y 4 Vaults,

Vaults, and Sewers should have been completed and opened as aforesaid, and as a Security for the Completion and opening thereof within Four Years from the passing of the Act now in

recital; and that on the Completion and opening of the said Street, and Completion of the Vaults and Sewers within such Period as aforesaid, the same should be delivered up to the said Westminster Improvement Commissioners, freed and discharged from such Security; but in case the said Street, Vaults,

4 and Sewers should not have been so opened and completed as aforesaid within such Time as aforesaid, then it was thereby

enacted, that it should be lawful for the said Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods for the Time being, at any Time

thereafter, at their sole Discretion, to levy and raise the Sum

of Fifty thousand Pounds, or so much thereof as should have been advanced by them as aforesaid to the Westminster Improvement Commissioners, together with Interest on the Amount of the Monies advanced, after the Kate of Five Pounds per Centum per Annum from the Time of advancing the same, by Sale or Mortgage of all or any Part of the Lands and Hereditaments which should liave been purchased by the said Westminster Improvement Commissioners, and the Conveyances whereof should have been so deposited as aforesaid; and that for the Purpose of such Security the said Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods for the Time being should be taken to have the first Charge on the Lands and Hereditaments so conveyed to the Westminster Improvement Commissioners, and the Title Deeds relating to which should liave been deposited as aforesaid, and should hold the same freed from all Estate or Interest or Claim of the Westminster Improvement Commissioners, and all Persons claiming under them; and that, subject to the making and paying the said Monies so advanced as aforesaid, and such Interest as afore-< said, and to the Payment of the Costs and Expenses relating to raising the same, the said Lands and Hereditaments, or the unsold Part thereof, should (subject nevertheless to any Mortgage which might have been made under the aforesaid Power) 4 be freed and discharged from such Charge or Lien as aforesaid in all respects as if such Deposit had not been made; and any Surplus to arise on any Sale, after answering the Purposes aforesaid, should be paid to the said Westminster Improvement Commissioners; and it was by the Act now in recital further enacted, that if and when the Commissioners of Her Majesty's 4 Woods should have been satisfied that the full Sum of Seventyfive thousand Pounds had been expended as aforesaid, towards purchasing the Area of and forming the said Street and Works, 4 the said last-named Commissioners should not have at their Disposal Monies sufficient to pay to the said Westminster Improvement Commissioners the said Sum of Fifty thousand Pounds so by the Act now in recital authorized to be paid to them as aforesaid, then and thenceforth Interest after the Rate of Five Pounds per Centum per Annum should be paid by the said Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods to the Westminster

4 Improve-

1848. Westminster Improvement. Cap. 124.

4 Improvement Commissioners on the said Sum of Fifty thousand Pounds, or on so much as should remain unpaid, from the Time at which the said Commissioners of Her Majesty's ' Woods should be satisfied that the said Sum of Seventy-five ' thousand Pounds had been expended as aforesaid up to the Time at which the said Sum of Fifty thousand Pounds, or the unpaid Part thereof, should be paid, and that such Interest

should be raised and paid in all respects as the said Sum of Fifty thousand Pounds was authorized to be raised and paid by the Act now in recital; but in case the said Westminster Improvement Commissioners should borrow the Sum of Fifty thousand Pounds, or any Part thereof, on the Security or Credit of the said Sum of Fifty thousand Pounds thereby directed to be paid to them, and should pay for the Monies borrowed a Rate of Interest lower than the Rate of Five Pounds per Centum per Annum, then only the Rate of Interest which should be paid by the Westminster Improvement Commissioners in respect of the Principal Monies so borrowed should be paid by the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods in respect of the said Sum of Fifty thousand Pounds, or so

much thereof as should remain unpaid: And whereas previously to the passing of the said Westminster Improvement Act, 1847, the said Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods caused an Estimate to be made of the probable Expense of purchasing the Area of and of opening the said Street, to be ' called Victoria Street, and it was then estimated that the Pur chase Money for the whole Area would amount to the Sum

of One hundred and twenty thousand Pounds, the Expenses of the Purchase to the Sum of Fifteen thousand Pounds, and the

Cost of opening the Street as a public Thoroughfare to the Sum 4 of Twelve thousand Pounds: And whereas since the Time when the said Estimate was made the Westminster Improvement ' Commissioners have either actually purchased, or entered into

Agreements for the Purchase of, more than Half the Property ' required for the aforesaid Area, and have deposited at the

Office of the said Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods a 4 Plan and detailed Description of all the Properties lying within ' the Area of the said proposed Street, and the Purchase of ' which is necessary for the opening of the same Street or public Thoroughfare (and which Properties formed the Basis of the aforesaid Estimate), and also a Statement of the Prices paid or payable, or now estimated to be payable, in respect of the whole of such Properties, from which it appears that the total Purchase Money required for the same will probably be about

One hundred and ten thousand Pounds: And whereas, in order ' to facilitate the Completion of the said new Street, to be called Victoria Street, as a public Thoroughfare, it is expedient that

such further Provisions and Enactments should be made as are herein-after contained:' May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present

II. And whereas by an Act passed in the Fifth and Sixth Years of the Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act for further extending the Approaches London Bridge and the Avenues adjoining to the Royal Exchange in the City of London, and for amending the Acts relating thereto respectively; and for raising a Sum of Money towards opening a Street to Clerken-c well Green in the County of Middlesex in continuation of the new Street from Farringdon Street in the City of London, the Charges upon the Estates and Revenues of the Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City of London were continued until the Charges on the London Bridge Approaches Fund, then made or authorized to be made, were fully paid and satisfied: And whereas the said Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens, with the view of affording Facilities for the Completion of the Westminster Improvements, have consented to the varying of the Priorities as authorized by this Act Be it enacted. That if at the Time when such Completion of such Expenditure of the said Sum of Seventy-five thousand Pounds shall have been certified as aforesaid the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods shall not have Monies in their Hands applicable or sufficient for Payment of Interest on the said Sum of Fifty thousand Pounds, then out of the Fund commonly called The London Bridge Approaches Fund," but subject to the Payment of any Interest or Annuities payable in respect of any Principal Sums charged on the said Fund under any Act or Acts of Parliament now in force prior to any Sums charged or to be charged on the said Fund by or in favour of the Commissioners of Her

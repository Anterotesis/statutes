An Act further to explain and amend the Acts for the Commutation of Tithes in England and Wales.

[4th June 1840.]

WHEREAS by an Act passed in the Seventh Year of

• the Reign of His late Majesty King William the Fourth, intituled An Act for the Commutation of Tithes in England and 4 Wales, it is enacted, that from the First Day of January next following the Confirmation of any Apportionment in any 4 Parish under the said Act, the Lands of such Parish shall be 4 absolutely discharged from Tithes, except as in the said Act 4 is provided in certain Cases, and instead thereof there shall be payable to the Person entitled to such Tithes, and in that 4 Behalf mentioned in the said Apportionment, a Sum of Money 4 in the Nature of a Rent-charge issuing out of the Lands charged therewith; and by an Act passed in the First Year of the Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act to 4 amend an Act for the Commutation of Tithes in England and 4 Wales, Provision is made for the Lands in a Parish being ( discharged from Tithes (except as in the said first-recited Act is excepted) by Agreement between the Parties to any

• Parochial Agreement or Supplemental Agreement, from certain Days preceding or following the Confirmation of the 4 Apportionment, instead of the said First Day of January next

• following such Confirmation, but so that the first Payment ( of the Rent-charge be made and recoverable at the Expiration 4 of Six Calendar Months from the Time from which such 4 Lands are discharged from the Payment of Tithes; and 4 by an Act passed in the last Session of Parliament, the Commissioners appointed under the said first-recited Act are r enabled by their Award, and the Land Owners and Tithe 4 Owners by Supplemental Agreement, in like Manner to fix

1840.

115

7\thes Commutation Ad* Amendment Cap* 15.

the Period at which any Rent-charne shall commence: And whereas after an Agreement for or Award of Rent-charge has ‘ been made and confirmed by the said Commissioners, much

Delay is often occasioned in settling and adjusting the ‘ Apportionment before the same can be confirmed by the Commissioners; and, to avoid the Loss of the Proportion of

Tithes or Composition for the Period intervening between ( the Expiration of any former Agreement or Composition and the Commencement of such Rent-charge, the Tithe Owner is

compelled to have recourse to taking Tithes in Kind, or to a ‘ Sait in Equity; and in other Cases, by reason of the Lands ‘ so remaining subject to Tithes, or Composition for Tithes,

1 daring such Period, such Tithes continue to be taken in ‘ Kind,* or may be so taken on the Determination of any Com-‘ position existing at the Date of such Agreement or Award,

notwithstanding that the Parties have agreed for, or the Commissioners awarded, the Sum which under the Provisions of 1 the said Acts ought to be taken as the permanent Rent-( charge payable instead of such Tithes; and great Hardship

is thereby occasioned, contrary to the Spirit and Intent of the ( mi Acts: And whereas it is expedient to make Provision for ( Remedy thereof, and otherwise to explain and amend the said ( recited Acts, in manner herein-after mentioned Be it therefore enacted-by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That in every Case where an annual Sum by way of Rent-charge shall have been fixed in any Parish, instead of the Tithes of such Parish, either by Agreement or Award, it shall be lawful for the said Commissioners, by a' Declaration in Writing under their Hands and Seal of Office,* or the Hands of any Two of them, at any Period after the Confirmation of any such Agreement or Award respectively, and before the Confirmation of the Apportionment to be made in respect of the Rent-charge so fixed, upon the Application in Writing of any Land Owner or Occupier, and upon such Security being given to the said Commissioners as they shall in their Discretion think sufficient for the due Payment to the Parties entitled thereto of such Rent-charge from the Day to be fixed in such Declaration, to declare that the Lands in such Parish shall be discharged from the Liability to Payment or Render of Tithes, or Composition or Rent in the Nature thereof instead of Tithes, and that instead thereof the annual Payment or Rent-charge so fixed by any such Award or Agreement respectively shall be paid to the Person entitled to the same by half-yearly Payments, commencing and calculating from such Day of Discharge named in such Declaration as aforesaid: Provided always, that the Day to be fixed in such Declaration of the said Commissioners as aforesaid shall, in every Case in which any Agreement for a Composition or Rent in the Nature thereof instead of Tithes shall be in force at the Time of making such Application to them as aforesaid, be the

II. Provided also, and be it enacted, That nothing in this Act shall extend or be construed to extend to annul or make void any Lease or Leases of Tithes granted before the Twenty-fifth Day of March and which shall end or determine on or before the First Day of January next; and that in any Parish or Place where such Lease or Leases shall have been granted as aforesaid, no Tithe Payer shall be at liberty to make the Application hereby authorized to be made, until after the Expiration of such Lease or Leases respectively, except in respect of Lands the Tithes whereof are not included in such Lease.

An Act for carrying into effect the Treaty between Her Majesty and the Republic of Venezuela, for the Suppression of the Slave Trade.

[7th August 1840.]

WHEREAS on Fifteenth Day of March in the Year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine a Treaty was concluded and signed at Caracas, between Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Republic of Venezuela, for the Suppression of the Slave Trade: And whereas by the First Article of the said Treaty Great Britain and the Republic of Venezuela declare the

Traffic in Slaves abolished for ever; and in order to avoid any Doubts that may hereafter occur from any Circumstances proving prejudicial to the Interest of Commerce and Navigation, for Want of a proper Explanation of the real Spirit of the Phrase Traffic in Slaves," the said Contracting Powers thereby mutually declare it to be understood by such Traffic, such only which is carried on in Negroes brought from Africa, in order to transport

them to other Parts of the World for Sale, but in no Manner whatever the conveying from one Port or Place to another belonging to die Republic the Slaves existing within 4 it, be such undertaken either with the Object of selling them, or with any other not prohibited by the Laws: And whereas by the Second Artide it was agreed by the Republic of Venezuela to preserve in force the Provisions of the Law of the Eighteenth of February One thousand eight hundred and twenty-five, the Object of which was to declare as Pirates, and punish with the Pain of Death, all such Venezuelans, who, on the High Seas or in any other Place under the Jurisdiction of the Republic, may be found embarking, transporting, 4 or disembarking One or more Persons brought from Africa as Slaves: And whereas

by the Third Article it was agreed, that although the Law just cited had produced the desired Effect in not having been infringed by any Venezuelan up to the Time of the said Treaty, Venezuela notwithstanding will promulgate every other Legislative Provision that may be deemed requisite for the Prevention of her Citizens engaging in any way in the said Traffic in Slaves, and for the complete Extinction thereof seeing that the same are in harmony with those which may be promulgated by Great Britain for the like Object: And whereas by the Fourth Article Her Majesty the

243

3° & 4° VICTORIA, c. 67.

Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and the Republic of Venezuela mutually engaged to specify, by an additional Convention hereafter to be concluded between the Contracting Parties, the Acts which constitute Piracy, in which will be comprehended the Traffic in Slaves; and that after the Conclusion of such Convention the Legislative Power of each Country shall promulgate, with as little Delay as possible, Laws for the Punishment of the said Acts committed by the respective Subjects or Citizens of either Nation: And whereas by the Fifth Article it was agreed that the mutual Right of Search might be exercised by the Ships of War of the respective Powers on board the Vessels of each Nation, but only within the Waters herein-after described; namely,

First. Along the Western Coast of Africa, from Cape Verd to the Distance of 4 Ten Degrees to the South of the Equator; that is to say, from the Tenth Degree of South Latitude to the Fifteenth Degree of North Latitude, and as far as the Fortieth Degree of East Longitude, reckoning from the Meridian of Caracas.

Second. All round the Island of Madagascar to the Extent of Twenty Leagues from that Island.

Third. The same Distance from the Coast of the Island of Cuba.

Fourth. The same Distance from the Coasts of the Island of Puerto Rico; and Fifth. The same Distance from the Coasts of Brazil.

It was however understood that a suspected Vessel descried and begun to be chased by the Cruizers whilst within the said Space of Twenty Leagues might be searched by them beyond those Limits, ifj without ever having lost Sight of her, they should only succeed in coming up with her at a greater Distance from the Coast: And whereas by the Sixth Article it was agreed that the Cruizers might detain Vessels trafficking in Slaves, be it that they have been fitted out with this Object, or that during the Voyage on which they are met with they may have been employed in the before-mentioned Traffic, in contravention of what is stipulated in the present Treaty, and might send or conduct them to those Places where they might be brought before the public Tribunals that take cognizance of Piracy, according to the Laws of the respective Countries; it was, however, not by this to be understood, that Venezuela was obliged to fit out Cruizers expressly to aid in the Pursuit of Vessels engaged in the Traffic of Slaves: And whereas, in order to regulate the Mode of carrying into effect the Provisions of the Two preceding Articles, the Contracting Parties by the Seventh Article agreed, —

First. That all Ships of the Navies of the Two Nations which should be hereafter employed to prevent the Traffic in Slaves should be furnished by their respective Governments with a Copy of the present Treaty in the English and Spanish Languages, and also of the Instructions for Cruizers annexed thereto, which Annex was to be considered as an integral Part of this Treaty.

Second. That Great Britain should communicate from Time to Time to Venezuela the Names of the several Ships furnished with such Instructions, the Force of each,

and the Names of their respective Commanders, and the same to be done by Venezuela towards Great Britain whenever Cruizers on her Part should be established with the like Object.

Third. That if at any Time there shall be just Cause to suspect than any Merchant Vessel under the Flag and proceeding under Convoy of any Ship or Ships of War of either of the Contracting Parties was engaged or intended to be engaged in the Traffic in Slaves, or was fitted out for that Purpose, or was, during the Voyage in which she might be met with, engaged in the Traffic in Slaves, it shall be lawful for the Commander of any Ship of the Navy of either of the Two Contracting Parties to visit the said Merchant Vessel, provided such be done within the Limits specified in the said Fifth Article of this Treaty; and such Commander should proceed to effect the same in Communication with the Commanding Officer of the Convoy, who it was thereby agreed should give every Facility to such Visit, and to the eventual Detention of such Vessel, and in all Things should assist to the utmost of his Power in the due Execution of the present Treaty.

Fourth. It was further mutually agreed, that the Commanders of the Ships of the Two Navies who should be employed on this Service should adhere strictly to the exact Tenor of the aforesaid Instructions annexed to the said Treaty:

3 & 4 Vict. LI 4 And

244

3° & 4° VICTORIA, c. 67.

And whereas by the Eighth Article the Contracting Parties engaged mutually to make good any Losses which their respective Subjects or Citizens might incur by the arbitrary or illegal Detention of their Vessels, it being understood that this Indemnity shall invariably be borne by the Government whose Cruizer shall have been guilty of such arbitrary and illegal Detention; agreeing likewise that the Visit and Detention of Vessels specified in the Fifth and Sixth Articles of the said Treaty can only be executed by British and Venezuelan Ships of War, and by those only which are furnished with the Special Instructions annexed to the said Treaty for its complete Execution: And whereas by the Ninth Article it was agreed that in case the Commanding Officer of any of the Ships of the Navies of Great Britain and Venezuela respectively, duly commissioned according to the Provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Articles of the said Treaty, should deviate in any respect from the Stipulations of the said Treaty, or from the Instructions annexed to it, the Government which shall conceive itself to be wronged thereby shall be entitled to demand Reparation; and in such Case the Government to which such Commanding Officer may belong binds itself to cause Inquiry to be made into the Subject of the Complaint, and to inflict upon the said Officer a Punishment proportionate to the Transgression committed: And whereas by the Tenth Article it was further agreed, that every Merchant Vessel, British or Venezuelan, which should be visited by virtue of what is expressed in the Fifth and Sixth Articles of the said Treaty, might lawfully be detained, and sent or brought before the corresponding Tribunal of the Nation to which she belongs, if in her Equipment there shall be found any of the Things herein-after mentioned; (namely,)

First. Hatches with open Gratings, instead of the close Hatches which are used in Merchant Vessels.

Second. Divisions or Bulk Heads in the Hold or on Deck, in greater Number than are necessary for Vessels engaged in lawful Trade.

Third. Spare Planks fitted for laying down as a Second or Slave Deck.

Fourth. Shackles, Bolts, and Handcuffs.

Fifth. A larger Quantity of Water in Cask or in Tanks than is requisite for the Consumption of a Crew of the Vessel as a Merchant Vessel.

Sixth. An extraordinary Number of Water Casks or of other Vessels for hold- ing Liquid, unless the Master shall produce a Certificate from the Custom House at the Place from which he cleared Outwards, stating that a sufficient Security had been given by the Owners of such Vessel that such extra Quantity of Casks or other Vessels should only be used to hold Palm Oil, or for other Purposes of lawful Commerce.

Seventh. A greater Quantity of Mess Tubs or Kids than are requisite for the Use of the Crew of the Vessel as a Merchant Vessel.

Eighth. A Boiler of an unusual Size, and larger than requisite for the Use of the Crew of the Vessel as a Merchant Vessel; or more than One Boiler of the ordinary Size.

Ninth. An extraordinary Quantity either of Rice, of the Flour of Brazil, of Manioc or Casava, commonly called Farinha, of Maize, or of Indian Corn, beyond what might probably be requisite for the Use of the Crew; such Rice, Flour, 4 Maize, or Indian Corn not being entered on the Manifest as Part of the Cargo for Trade.

Any One or more of these several Circumstances, if proved, shall be considered as Indications primd facie of the actual Employment of the Vessel in the Slave Trade, and will serve therefore to condemn and declare her a lawful Prize, unless it be established by satisfactory Evidence on the Part of the Master or Owners that the Vessel at the Time of her Detention was employed in some legal Pursuit: And whereas by the Eleventh Article it was agreed, that if in any Merchant Vessel should be found any of the Things specified in the preceding Article, the Master or Owner, or whatever other Person interested in her Equipment or Cargo, shall not have any Right to claim a Compensation for Losses, 4 Damages, or Expences in consequence of the Detention, although the Tribunal which passes Judgment may not have pronounced Sentence of Condemnation, unless it be clearly proved that the Objects which occasioned the said Detention were not on board

for

3° & 4° VICTORIAE, c. 67.

for the Slave Trade; in which Case the Captor, and in his Default the Government to which he belongs, shall be responsible to the Master or Owner of the Vessel for the Losses and Damages in question: And whereas by the Twelfth Article it was agreed between the Two Contracting Parties, that in all Cases in which a Vessel shall be detained under the said Treaty by their respective Cruizers as having been engaged in the Slave Trade, or as having been fitted out for the Purposes thereof and shall be adjudged and condemned accordingly, the Vessel shall immediately after its Condemnation be broken up entirely, and shall be sold in separate Parts after having been broken up: And whereas by the Thirteenth Article it was mutually agreed that the Instructions next following for the Ships of War, British and Venezuelan, which the respective Governments may have destined for the Prevention of the Traffic in Slaves, should be considered as an integral Portion thereof; that is to say,

Instructions for the Ships of War, British and Venezuelan, which the respective Governments may please to destine for the Prevention of the Traffic in Slaves.

Article First. — The Commander of any Ship of War belonging to Her Bri- 4 tannic Majesty or to the Republic of Venezuela, which shall be furnished with these Instructions, shall have a Right to visit, search, and detain' any British or Venezuelan Merchant Vessel which shall be engaged or suspected to be engaged in the Slave Trade, or to be fitted out for the Purpose thereof, or to have been engaged in the Traffic in Slaves during the Voyage in which she may be met with by such Ship of the British or Venezuelan Navies, provided that the Visit, Search, and Detention be made in accordance with the Places and within the Limits marked out in Article Five of the Treaty signed this Day, and which forms a Part of the present Instructions; and the said Commander shall thereupon without Delay bring or send such Merchant Vessel, with her Master, Crew, Cargo, and Slaves found on board, to one of the Ports hereafter mentioned, in order that Proceedings may be instituted in regard to them conformably to the Laws of the Nation under whose Flag the Vessel is sailing; such Commander shall deliver the same, together with her Papers, 4 to the proper Authorities or to the Persons that may have been specially appointed for that Purpose by the respective Governments.

Article Second. — Whenever a Ship of War of either of the Two Contracting Nations, duly authorized as aforesaid, shall meet a Merchantman liable to be visited under the Provisions of the said Treaty, the Search shall be conducted in the mildest Manner, and with every Attention which ought to be observed between allied and friendly Nations, and the Visit shall be made by an Officer holding a Rank not lower than that of Lieutenant in the Navies of Great Britain and Venezuela respectively, or by the Officer who at the Time shall be Second in Command of the Ship by which such Search is made.

Article Third. — The Commander of any Ship of the Two Navies, duly authorized as aforesaid, who may detain any Merchant Vessel in pursuance of the Tenor of the present Instructions, shall leave on board the Vessel so detained the Master, the Mate or Boatswain, and the Crew thereof, all the Cargo, and the Whole of the Slaves, if any, except in the Case herein-after specified in respect to Slaves on board of Venezuelan Vessels.

An Act for improving the Condition and extending the Benefits of Grammar Schools. > [7th August 1840.]

WHEREAS there are in England and Wales many endowed Schools, both of Royal and ' Private Foundation, for the Education of Boys or Youth wholly or principally in

1 Grammar; and the Term w Grammar " has been construed by Courts of Equity as having reference only to the dead Languages, that is to say, Greek and Latin: And whereas such ' Education, at the Period when such Schools or the greater Part were founded, was supposed not only to be sufficient to qualify Boys or Youths for Admission to the Universities, with

a view to the learned Professions, but also necessary for preparing them for the superior

Trades and Mercantile Business: And whereas from the Change of Times and other Causes such Education, without Instruction in other Branches of Literature and Science, is now of

less Value to those who ate entitled to avail themselves of such charitable Foundations,

whereby such Schools have, in many Instances, ceased to afford a substantial Fulfilment of the Intentions of the Founders; and the System of Education in such Grammar Schools

ought therefore to be extended and rendered more generally beneficial, in order to afford

such Fulfilment; but the Patrons, Visitors, and Governors thereof are generally unable of

their own Authority to establish any other System of Education than is expressly provided for by the Foundation, and Her Majesty's Courts of Law and Equity are frequently unable 1 to give adequate Relief, and in no Case but at considerable Expence: And whereas in consequence of Changes which have taken place in the Population of particular Districts it is

necessary, for the Purpose aforesaid, that in some Cases the Advantages of such Grammar

Schools should be extended to Boys other than those to whom by the Terms of the Foun-

dation or the existing Statutes the same is now limited, and that in other Cases some Restriction should be imposed, either with reference to the total Number to be admitted into the School, or as regains their Proficiency at the Time when they may demand Admission; but

in this respect also the said Patrons, Visitors, and Governors, and the Courts of Equity, are ' frequently without sufficient Authority to make such Extension or Restriction: And whereas it is expedient that in certain Cases Grammar Schools in the same Place should be united:

And whereas no Remedy can be applied in the Premises without the Aid of Parliament:' Be it therefore declared and enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That whenever, after the passing of this Act, any Question may come under Consideration in any of Her Majesty's Courts of Equity concerning the System of Education thereafter to be established in any Grammar School, or the Right of Admission into the same, whether such Question be already pending, or whether the same shall arise upon any Information, Petition, or other Proceedings which may be now or at any Time hereafter filed or instituted, for whatever Cause the same may have been or may be instituted, according to the ordinary Course of Proceedings in Courts of Equity or under the Provisions of this Act, it shall be lawful for the Court to make such Decrees or Orders as to the said Court shall seem expedient, as well for extending the System of Education to other useful Branches of Literature and Science in addition to or (subject to the Provisions herein-after contained) in lieu of the Greek and Latin Languages, or such other Instruction as may be required by the Terms of the Foundation or the then existing Statutes, as also for extending or restricting the Freedom or the Right of Admission to such School, by determining the Number or the Qualifications of Boys who may thereafter be admissible thereto, as free Scholars or otherwise, and for settling the Terms of Admission to and Continuance in the same, and to establish such Schemes for the Application of the Revenues of any such Schools as may in the Opinion of the Court be conducive to the rendering or maintaining such Schools in the greatest Degree efficient and useful, with due Regard to the Intentions of the respective Founders and Benefactors, and to declare at what Period and upon what Event such Decrees or Orders, or any Directions contained therein, shall be brought into operation, and that such Decrees and Orders shall have Force and Effect notwithstanding any Provisions contained in the Instruments of Foundation, Endowment, or Benefaction, or in the then exist-

Provided always, and be it enacted, That in making any such Decree or Order the Court shall consider and have regard to the Intentions of the Founders and Benefactors of every such Grammar School, the Nature and Extent of the Foundation and Endowment, the Rights of Parties interested therein, the Statutes by which the same has been hitherto governed, the Character of the Instruction theretofore afforded therein, and the existing State and Condition of the said School, and also the Condition, Rank, and Number of the Children entitled to and capable of enjoying the Privilege of the said School, and of those who may become so capable if any extended or different System of Education, or any Extension of the Right of Admission to the said School, or any new Statutes, shall be established.

III. Provided also, and be it enacted, That, unless it shall be found necessary from the Insufficiency of the Revenues of any Grammar School, nothing in this Act contained shall be construed as authorizing the Court to dispense with the teaching of Latin and Greek, or either of such Languages, now required to be taught, or to treat such Instruction otherwise than as the principal Object of the Foundation; nor to dispense with any Statute or Provision now existing, so far as relates to the Qualification of any Schoolmaster or Under Master.

IV. Provided also, and be it enacted, That in extending, as herein-before provided, the System of Education or the Right of Admission into any Grammar School in which the teaching of Greek or Latin shall be still retained, the Court shall not allow of the Admission of Children of an earlier Age or of less Proficiency than may be required by the Foundation or existing Statutes, or may be necessary to show that the Children are of Capacity to profit by the Kind of Education designed by the Founder.

V. Provided also, and be it enacted, That whenever, on account of the Insufficiency of the Revenues of any Grammar School, the Court shall think fit to dispense with the teaching of Greek or Latin, the Court shall prescribe such a Course of Instruction, and shall require such Qualifications in the Children at the Period of their Admission, as will tend to maintain the Character of the School as nearly as, with reference to the Amount of the Revenues, it may be analogous to that which was contemplated by the Founder; and that whenever, on the like Account, the Court shall think fit to dispense with any Statute or Provision as far as relates to the Qualification of any Schoolmaster or Under Master, the Court shall substitute such Qualification as will provide for every Object implied in the original Qualification, which may be capable of being retained notwithstanding such Insufficiency of the Revenues.

VI. Provided also, and be it enacted, That in case the Appointment of any additional Schoolmaster or Under Master shall be found necessary for the Purpose of carrying the Objects of this Act into execution, the Court shall require the same Qualification in such new Schoolmaster or Under Master respectively as may be required by the existing Statutes in the present Schoolmaster or Under Master, except such as may be wholly referable to their Capability of giving Instruction in any particular Branch of Education; but that every other Qualification implied in the Qualification of the original Schoolmaster or Under Master, and capable of being retained, shall be retained and required in such new Schoolmaster or Under Master; and the Court shall also in such Case declare in whom the Appointment of such new Schoolmaster or Under Master shall be vested, so as to preserve as far as may be the existing Rights of all Parties with regard to Patronage.

VII. Provided also, and be it enacted, That although under the Provisions herein-before contained the teaching of Greek or Latin in any Grammar School may be dispensed with, every such School, and the Masters thereof, shall be still considered as Grammar Schools, and Grammar Schoolmasters, and shall continue subject to the Jurisdiction of the Ordinary as heretofore; and that no Person shall be authorized to exercise the Office of Schoolmaster or Under Master therein without having such Licence, or without having made such Oath,

CAP. LXXXVIII.

An Act to amend the Act for the Establishment of County and District Constables.

[7th August 1840.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the last Session of Parliament, intituled An Act for the Establishment of County and District Constables by the Authority of Justices of the

i Peace; and it is expedient to make additional Provisions for facilitating the Execution thereof, and otherwise to amend the same:' Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That no Toll shall be demanded or taken on any Turnpike Road or Bridge for any Horse, or Police Van, Carriage, or Cart, passing along such Road or Bridge, in the Service of the Police established under the Provisions of the said Act; provided that the Constable in charge of such Horse, Van, Carriage, or Cart, if not the Chief Constable, shall produce an Order in Writing under the Hand of the Chief Constable, or shall have his Dress according to the Regulations of the Police Force at the Time of claiming the Exemption; and every Person who shall fraudulently claim or take the Benefit of the Exemption from Toll herein contained, not being lawfully entitled thereunto, shall for every such Offence be liable to a Penalty not more than Five Pounds; and in all such Cases the Proof of Exemption shall be upon the Person claiming the same.

II. And whereas by the said Act it is provided, that for the Purposes of the said Act,

all detached Parts of Counties shall be considered as Part of that County by which they

are wholly or partly surrounded: And whereas many populous Towns are situated in

more th$k One County; and also the Boundary of many Counties is so irregular that Parts

thereof although not wholly separated from the main Body of the County, may yet be more ' conveniently united, for the Purposes of the said Act, with some neighbouring County:' Be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Justices of any Two or more neighbouring Counties, in their several General or Quarter Sessions assembled, from Time to Time to agree that such Parts of their several Counties as to them shall seem fit shall, for the Purposes of the said Act, be considered as forming Part of any other of the said Counties; and whenever any such District shall be so transferred, for the Purposes of the said Act, from One County to another, with the Consent of the Justices of both the last-mentioned Counties, such District shall be considered, for the Purposes of the said Act, as if it were detached from the County to which it belongs, and wholly surrounded by the County to which it is so transferred; and all the Provisions contained herein or in the said Act, or in an Act passed in the last Session of Parliament, intituled An Act for the better Administration of Justice in detached Parts of Counties, respecting detached Parts of Counties, shall be taken to apply to such transferred Districts.

III. And be it enacted, That so much of the first-recited Act as provides that the Expences of putting the said Act in execution shall be paid out of the County Rate shall be repealed; and that, for the Purposes of defraying the Expences of the said Act in any County in which, or in any Part of which, the said Act shall be put in force, the Justices of such County in General or Quarter Session assembled shall make a fair and equal Police Rate, and for that Purpose shall assess and tax the whole District for which the Constables are appointed rateably and equally, according to a certain Pound Rate of the full and fair annual Value of all Messuages, Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments liable to the County Rate, or which, if the whole of the said District were to all Intents and Purposes within their County, would be liable to the County Rate therein, including all detached Parts of other Counties, and also all Liberties and Franchises (except as hereinafter excepted) which are locally situated in such County, or wholly or partly surrounded by such County, and declared by the said Act to be considered as forming Part of such County for the Purposes of the said Act, but excluding all detached Parts of the said County, all Parts of the County contributing to the Police Rate of any other County or to the Metropolitan Police Rate, and all incorporated Boroughs which are or shall be

within the Provisions of an Act passed in the Sixth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty for regulating Corporations, or of any Charter granted in pursuance of the last-recited Act, or of any Act made for the Amendment thereof, and all those Towns and Places for which Constables or Watchmen shall have been appointed under the Act passed in the Fourth Year of His late Majesty making Provisions for the lighting and watching of Parishes in England or Wales, or under any Local Act authorizing the Appointment of Constables or Watchmen in any Town or Place, and authorizing Rates to be made for defraying the Expences of such Constables or Watchmen, and shall not be discontinued before the passing of this Act, until they shall be discontinued, or until the Chief Constable of the County within which, for the Purposes of this and the said first-recited Act, such Parish, Town, or Place is situated, shall have notified, as he is herein-after empowered to do, that he is ready to undertake the Charge of such Parish, Town, or Place: Provided always, that all Expences of putting the said Act in execution before the passing of this Act shall be paid out of the County Rate as if this Act had not been made.

IV. And be it enacted, That the Value of all Property rateable for the Purposes of the How Property said Act shall be computed by the said Justices according to the last Valuation for the rateable is to be Time being acted upon in assessing the County Rate or Liberty Rate, or Rate in the Nature valued *

of a County Rate (if any), to which such Property is rateable, unless, in the Case of any Liberty or Franchise or detached Part of any County, the Justices of the County in which such Liberty or Franchise or detached Part is situated shall be dis-satisfied with such Valuation.

V. And be it enacted, That every Police Rate which the Justices shall have made as Police Rate aforesaid shall be collected in their County from the Persons who are liable to contribute to be levied thereunto with and as Part of the County Rate; and the Warrants issued by the Justices to Cow^Rau;. the High Constables, and by the High Constables to the Overseers and others required to collect the County Rates, shall distinguish between the Rates to be levied from those Places which are liable to the Police Rate in that County and those which are not liable thereunto, and shall state how much is levied for the County Rate, and how much for the Police Rate, and the said Rates shall be levied accordingly.

VI. And be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Justices of any County in General Contributions or Quarter Session assembled, for the Purpose of obtaining the Sum which ought to be LII^rti^and contributed from any detached Part of any other County, or any Liberty or Franchise not detached Parts contributing to the County Rate of such first-mentioned County, towards any such Police of Counties.

which Warrant they shall require the Treasurer of the County to which such detached Part belongs, or the Treasurer or other Person (if any) having the Receipt of any Liberty Rate, or Rate in the Nature of a County Rate levied within such Liberty, to pay to the Treasurer of such first-mentioned County, out of the Monies collected by way of County Rate,

Liberty Rate, or Rate in the Nature of a County Rate, the Amount mentioned in the Warrant; and that the Person to whom any such Warrant shall be directed shall, within Forty Days from the Delivery of such Warrant to him, pay the Amount to the Treasurer of the County from which such Warrant shall have issued, and shall be allowed for the same in his Accounts with his County or Liberty; and every such Warrant shall specify the Rate in the Pound at which the Sum mentioned therein shall be computed.

VII. And be it enacted, That, for the Purpose of reimbursing the Treasurer or other How Treasurer Person by whom any such Sum shall have been paid, the Justices of the County to which of such other such detached Part belongs, or of the Liberty or Franchise, as the Case may be, shall order ^Tlhail be" a Police Rate to be made, at the Rate mentioned in the Warrant, upon such detached Part reimbuwed. of their County, or upon such Liberty or Franchise respectively, which shall be levied

and collected thereon with and as Part of the County Rate, Liberty Rate, or Rate in the Nature of a Liberty Rate, to which such detached Part of a County or such Liberty or Franchise is liable, in like Manner as the Police Rate is levied and collected by Order of the Justices of any County for the Expences of the Police of their own County.

VIII. And be it enacted, That if Payment shall not be made within the said Forty Days, according to the Exigency of the Warrant, or if there shall be no Person to whom such Warrant can be directed, or no County Kate, Liberty Rate, or Rate in the Nature of a County Rate, to which the Inhabitants of such Liberty or detached Part of another County e contribute, or if the Justices of the first-named County shall be dis-satisfied with the Valuation upon which such* Rate was assessed, or if, for any other Reason, it shall seem more convenient to the Justices of the first-mentioned County, it shall be lawful for them to levy the full Amount af the Police Rate upon any such detached Part of another County or Liberty or Franchise in respect of which such Amount is demandable; and for the Purpose of levying and collecting such Rates the Justices of such first-mentioned County shall have, within every such detached Part of another County and within every such Liberty and Franchise respectively, the same|Powers which they have for levying and collecting County Rates within the Limits of their own Commission; and such Rates may be levied and collected by the like Methods, and subject to the same Right of Appeal, as if such detached Parts of another County or such Liberty or Franchise respectively were Part of such first-mentioned County, and within the Hundred, Wapentake, Ward, Rape, Lathe, or such other Division of the County in which they are locally situated, or, if not wholly lying in One Hundred, Wapentake, Ward, Rape, Lathe, or such other Division, in that One with which they have the longest common Boundary respectively; and the High Constable of every such Hundred, Wapentake, Ward, Rape, Lathe, or such other Division, on the Receipt of a Warrant to that Effect under the Hands of Two or more of the said Justices, shall collect the said Rates; and the Overseer of the Poor, or in default of Overseers, or in case there shall be no separate Rate for the Relief of the Poor in any Portion of such detached Part or Liberty or Franchise, such Person or Persons as the Justices of the first-mentioned County in Quarter Session assembled shall appoint for that Purpose in every Parish and Place to which such detached Parts or Liberty or Franchise, or any Part thereof, belong, upon Receipt of a Warrant to that Effect from such High Constable, shall pay the Amount assessed upon their Parish or Place respectively, or upon that Part of it which is liable thereunto, in like Manner, and subject to the like Penalties in case of Default, as if such detached Parts or Liberty or Franchise were Part of such first-mentioned County, and within such Hundred, Wapentake, Ward, Rape, Lathe, or other Division as aforesaid respectively.

IX. And be it enacted, That the Treasurer of any County, or any Person having an Order for that Purpose under the Hand of such Treasurer, may inspect any County Rate made or to be made for any other County or Liberty or Franchise the Inhabitants of any Part of which shall be liable to be rated to the Police Rate in the first-named County, and may also inspect any Returns concerning all or any of the Parishes, Townships, Precincts, and Places whether parochial or extra-parochial, the Inhabitants of which are liable to be rated as aforesaid, which have been or are to be delivered in pursuance of any of the Acts relating to County Rates, and may take Copies or Extracts from any such Rates or Returns, without Payment of any Fee or Reward; and if any Person having the Custody of any such Rate or Return shall wilfully neglect or refuse to permit any such Treasurer or other Person authorized as aforesaid to inspect the same, or to take Copies or Extracts from the same, within Two Days after such Order shall have been produced and shown to him, or a Copy thereof left at his usual Place of Abode, he shall, on Conviction thereof before any Two Justices of the Peace, forfeit and pay for every such Offence such Sum not exceeding Ten Pounds as they shall think meet.

X.

X. And whereas it is expedient that Provision should be made i or giving every Person executing a Warrant of Attorney to confess Judgment, or a Cognovit actionem, (save as herein-after mentioned,) due Information of the Nature and Effect thereof be it enacted, That from and after the Time appointed for the Commencement of this Act no Warrant of Attorney to confess Judgment in any personal Action, or Cognovit actionem given by any Person, save and except a Warrant of Attorney to confess Judgment in an Action upon a Bond or Writing obligatory recited therein or collateral therewith, shall be of any Force unless there shall be present some Attorney of One of the Superior Courts on behalf of such Person, expressly named by him, and attending at his Request, to inform him of the Nature and Effect of such Warrant or Cognovit, before the same is executed; which Attorney shall subscribe his Name as a Witness to the due Execution thereof, and thereby declare himself to be Attorney for the Person executing the same, and state that he subscribes as such Attorney.

XII. And whereas Injustice is frequently done to Creditors by secret Warrants of c Attorney to confess Judgments for securing the Payment of Money, whereby Persons in a i State of Insolvency are enabled to keep up the Appearance of being in good Circumstances,

and the Persons holding such Warrants of Attorney have the Power of taking the Property of such Insolvents in Execution at any Time, to the Exclusion of the rest of their Creditors for Remedy whereof be it enacted, That from and after the First Day of November One thousand eight hundred and forty, if the Holder thereof shall think fit, every Warrant of Attorney to confess Judgment in any personal Action, or a true Copy thereof, and of the Attestation thereof, and the Defeasance and Endorsement thereon (if any), shall, within Twenty-one Days after the Execution of such Warrant of Attorney be filed, together with an Affidavit of the Time of the Execution thereof, with the proper Officer in One of Her Majesty's Superior Courts at Dublin, in which Judgment upon such Warrant of Attorney shall thereafter be entered up.

XIII.

Copy thereof respectively, shall be filed, otherwise such Warrant of Attorney shall be null on the same and void to all Intents and Purposes, Paper.

XV. And be it enacted, That the said Officer of the said Court in which such Warrant of officer of Court Attorney or Copy thereof shall be filed shall cause every such Warrant of Attorney in any to keep a Book personal Action, and every Copy thereof filed in his said Office, to be numbered, and shall I^Par^uUre keep a Book or Books in his said Office in which he shall cause to be fairly entered an of each Warrant alphabetical List of every such Warrant of Attorney, containing therein the Names and o(Attorney.

Attorney, or a Copy thereof as aforesaid, the Sum of One Shilling, and no more. w«mut,

is given as a Security shall have been satisfied or discharged.

XIX. And whereas the existing Law is defective in not providing adequate Means for Sheriff em enabling Judgment Creditors to obtain Satisfaction from the Property of their Debtors, and

it is expedient to give Judgment Creditors more effectual Remedies against the Real and tion of Land%

Personal Estate oi their Debtors than they possess under the existing Law; be it therefore &c. to Judg-

enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Sheriff or other Officer to whom any Writ of Elegit, ment Creditor *

or any Precept in pursuance thereof, shall be directed at the Suit of any Person upon any

Judgment which at the Time appointed for the Commencement of this Act shall have been

recovered, or shall be thereafter recovered, in any Action in any of Her Majesty's Superior

Courts at Dublin, to make and deliver Execution unto the Party in that Behalf suing, of all

such Lands, Tenements, Rectories, Tithes, Rents, and Hereditaments, including Lands and

Hereditaments which may be of Copyhold Tenure, as the Person against whom Execution is

so sued, or any Person in Trust for him, shall have been seised or possessed of at the Time of

entering up the said Judgment, or at any Time afterwards, or over which such Person shall

at the Time of entering up such Judgment, or at any Time afterwards, have any disposing

Power which he might, without the Assent of any other Person, exercise for his own Benefit,

in like Manner as the Sheriff or other Officer may now make and deliver Execution of one

Moiety of the Lands and Tenements of any Person against whom a Writ of Elegit is sued

out; which Lands, Tenements, Rectories, Tithes, Rents, and Hereditaments, by force and

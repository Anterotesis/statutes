WHEREAS by an Act passed in the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of Her present

Majesty, intituled An Act to consolidate and amend the Laics relating to Friendly

<c Members, for better enabling them to purchase Food, Firing, Clothes, or other Neces- " saries, or the Tools or Implements of their Trade or Calling, or to provide for the

" Education of their Children or Kindred, provided (amongst other tilings) that the c " Shares in any such Investment should not be transferable:" And whereas various

Associations of Working Men have been formed for the mutual Relief, Maintenance, ' Education, and Endowment of the Members, their Husbands, Wives, Children, or c Kindred, and for procuring to them Food, Lodging, Clotiling, and other Necessaries, by

exercising or carrying on in common their respective Trades or Handicrafts; and it is ' expedient to extend the Provisions of the said recited Act to such Associations, and otherwise to regulate the same:* Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

3d, Whether or not any Loans shall be contracted with Persons (whether Members of the Society or not) for the better effecting the Purposes thereof, and how such Loans and Interest thereon (if any) shall be secured; yet so that the Interest on any such Loan shall not exceed the Rate of Six Pounds per Centum per Annum, and so that the total Amount of Monies to be owing on Loan by the Society at any One Time shall not exceed Four Times the Amount of paid-up Subscriptions for the Time being; and a Declaration under the Hands of the Trustees or Trustee of the Society, certified by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, shall be sufficient Evidence in that Behalf of the Amount of paid-up Subscriptions:

III. The Interest of any Member in any such Society shall not be transferable, but the whole Amount of the Balance due to any Member shall be paid to him on Withdrawal from the same according to the Rules of the Society.

IV. If any Member in any such Society shall become bankrupt, or shall take the Benefit of any Act for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors, such Member shall be taken to have withdrawn from the Society on the Day of the Date of the filing of the Petition for Adjudication of Bankruptcy, or (in the Case of any Insolvent Debtor) of the Declaration of Insolvency, or the Petition for Discharge or for a Vesting Order respectively, as the Case may be; and the Assignees of any such Bankrupt or Insolvent shall have such Claim upon the Society,

VI. The Sheriff in Scotland shall within his County have the like Jurisdiction as is hereby given to the Judge of the County Court in any Matter arising under this Act.

VII.

IV. 4 And whereas it is not just that First Fruits and Tenths should be paid by the 4 Holders of Dignities, Prebends, and Offices of which the Estates are vested in the said 4 Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and it is inexpedient to diminish the Amount of the Fund 4 accruing to the Governors of Queen Awnis Bounty in respect of such Prebends, Dignities, 4 and Offices, and of Sinecure Rectoriesbe it enacted, That the Holders of all Dignities, Prebends, and Offices, whereof the Lands, Tithes, Tenements, and other Hereditaments and

the Consent and Approbation of the Lord High Treasurer, or of the Commissioners

for executing the Office of Lord High Treasurer, to borrow and raise, on the Credit of the 4 several Duties on Coals imported into the Port of London, and brought by inland Conveyance, the Duty on Wine, and other Revenues therein particularly specified, (subject 4 to certain Charges then already existing thereon,) any Sum or Sums of Money not 4 exceeding in the whole the Sum of Five hundred and fourteen thousand Pounds, for the Purpose of executing the several Improvements and making the Advances hereinbefore mentioned, and the Commissioners for the Issue of Exchequer Bills for public 4 Works are authorized to advance and lend the same on the Security of the said Funds 4 herein-before mentioned or referred to; and by the Two first-recited Acts the said 4 Commissioners are authorized to sell and lease the Property to be acquired for the Purposes 4 of the said Improvements, and to apply the Monies to be thereby produced towards the 4 Completion of the said Improvements: And whereas the said Commissioners for the Issue

of Property required for making the several new Streets and Improvements aforesaid, c before any considerable Return can be obtained therefrom by Sales or Leases, will neces- sarily exceed the estimated ultimate Cost of the said Improvements: And whereas it is

essential to the speedy and economical Execution of the said contemplated Improvements,

mentioned, and that the said Land Revenues should be indemnified against any Loss in

respect of such Charge, as after mentioned: ' May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful Commisaioners for the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods, Forests, Land Revenues, Works, and Build-

4 with the Consent of the Bishop of the Diocese in which such Parish was locally situated,

4 signified under his Hand and Seal, to apply to the Patron or Patrons of the Church of 4 such Parish for his Consent to make such Division, and for such Patron or Patrons to 4 signify his or their Consent thereto under his Hand and Seal; and the said Commissioners 4 should, upon the Consent of the said Patron or Patrons so signified, represent the whole

Matter to His Majesty in Council, and should state in such Representation the Bounds by 4 which it was proposed, with such Consent as aforesaid, to divide such Parish, together with 4 the relative and respective Proportions of Glebe Lands, Tithe% Moduses, or other Endowments which would by such Division arise and accrue and remain and be within each of 4 such respective Divisions, and also the relative Proportions of the estimated Amount of the 4 Value or Produce of Fees, Oblations, Offerings, or other Ecclesiastical Dues or Profits 4 which might arise and accrue within each of such respective Divisions; and if thereupon 4 His Majesty in Council should think fit to direct such Division to be made, such Order of 4 His Majesty in Council should be valid and good in Law for the Purpose of effecting such 4 Division; provided always, that no such Division of any Parish into distinct Parishes should 4 completely take effect until after the Death, Resignation, or other Avoidance of the existing 4 Incumbent of the Parish to be divided; and it was by the same Act provided and further 4 enacted, that all Tithes, Moduses, Endowments, or other Ecclesiastical Dues or Profits 4 belonging to the Incumbent of any such Parish, whether by Endowment, Prescription,

4 Usage, or otherwise, should, when so divided as aforesaid, belong to and be recoverable by 4 the Incumbents of the Churches of each of the Divisions respectively of the Parish to which 4 they should be assigned, in like Manner in every respect as they were before recoverable by 4 the Incumbent of the original Parish; and it was by the same Act further provided and

4 the Diocese, and paid in manner therein-after directed; and it was by the same Act

4 further enacted, that every such distinct and separate Parish as aforesaid should, when 4 such Division as aforesaid should become complete by the Death, Resignation, or other 4 Avoidance of the existing Incumbent of the original Parish, be deemed either a Rectory, * Vicarage, Donative or Perpetual Curacy, and the Spiritual Person serving the same, the 4 Rector, Vicar, or Perpetual Curate thereof, or Person having Cure of Souls therein,

4 acording to the Nature of the original Church of the Parish so divided, and should be for

4 had

217

4° & 5° VICTORIA, c.42.

had been recently consecrated, and in which Divine Service was regularly performed, and

which afforded Accommodation for Eight hundred Persons, including Five hundred Free 4 Seats for the Use of the Poor; and also stating, that, having taken into consideration all

the Circumstances attending the same Parish, it appeared to them to be expedient that the

said Parish should be divided into Two distinct and separate Parishes under the Sixteenth 4 Section of the said Act passed in the Fifty-eighth Year of the Reign of His Majesty King 4 George the Third (being the first before-mentioned Enactment of such Act), and that the 4 said Parishes should be named respectively the Parish of Winterbourne and the Parish of 4 Saint John the Baptist, Frenckag, and that the said Chapel at Frenchag should be the Parish 4 Church of the said Parish of Saint John the Baptist, Frenehay, with certain Boundaries in 4 such Representation set forth; and also stating, that the whole of the Glebe Land lying 4 within the Parishes of Winterbourne and Saint John the Baptist, Frenehay, would belong to 4 the Parish of Winterbourne, that the Tithes arising from the Lands specified in the 4 Schedule thereunto annexed, and valued at One hundred and seventy-six Pounds Ten 4 Shillings per Annum, and being One Sixth of the Tithes of the then existing Parish 4 of Winterbourne, would belong to the Parish of Saint John the Baptist, Frenehay, that there 4 were no Moduses or other Endowments arising in the said Parish of Winterbourne, that it 4 was estimated that the Value or Produce of Fees, Oblations, Offerings, and other 4 Ecclesiastical Dues, which then arose in the said Parish of Saint John the Baptist, Frenehay,

4 were less by One Half than those which arose in the Parish of Winterbourne, but would 4 probably increase; and also stating that the Consents of the Lord Bishop of Bristol, and 4 of the Presidents and Scholars of Saint John Baptist College in Oxford, the Patrons of the

Parish Church of Winterbourne, had been obtained, as required by the above-mentioned Enactment of the said Act of the Fifty-eighth Year of His Majesty King George the Third, and His said Majesty having taken the said Representation, together with a Map thereunto annexed,

4 into consideration, was pleased, by and with the Advice of His Privy Council, to approve 4 thereof, and to order that the proposed Division should be accordingly made and effected

agreeably to the Provisions of the said Acts: And whereas the said Chapel of Frenehay was 4 consecrated on the Twenty-first Day of August One thousand eight hundred and thirtyfour, at which Time the Reverend John Crosby Clark, Batchelor of Divinity, was the 4 Rector of the said original Parish Church of Winterbourne: And whereas the Order in 4 Council before set forth bears Date the Twenty-seventh Day of May One thousand 4 eight hundred and thirty-six: And whereas the said Reverend John Crosby Clark 4 resigned his said Living shortly after the Consecration of the said Chapel of Frenehay,

4 and before the Date of the said Order in Council, and thereupon the Reverend William 4 Birkett AUen, Doctor in Civil Law, was presented by the said President and Scholars of 4 Saint John Baptist College in Oxford to the Rectory of Winterbourne: And whereas it has 4 been considered, that in the Provision in the said Act of Parliament that no Division of any 4 Parish into distinct Parishes shall completely take effect until after the Death, Resignation, 4 or other Avoidance of the existing Incumbent of the Parish to be divided, the Word 4 44 existing" had reference to the Time of the Consecration of the said Chapel of Frenehay, 4 and not to the Date of the said Order in Council; and it has therefore been considered 4 that the Division of the said original Parish of Winterbourne into Two distinct Parishes 4 became complete for all Purposes immediately upon the said Order in Council having been 4 made, and accordingly the President and Scholars of Saint John Baptist College in Oxford, 4 as the Patrons of the Parish Church of Frenehay, on the Third Day of April One thousand 4 eight hundred and thirty-nine, presented the Reverend Thomas Chandler Curties to the 4 Rectory of Saint John the Baptist, Frenehay, and the said Thomas Chandler Curties was thereupon duly instituted to the same Rectory; and the said Thomas Chandler Curties having 4 afterwards resigned such Living, the said President and Scholars of Saint John Baptist 4 College in Oxford presented the Reverend John Carter to the same Rectory, who was duly 4 instituted thereto, and is now considered to be and officiates as the Rector of the Parish 4 Church of Saint John the Baptist, Frenehay; and from the Date of the said Order 4 in Council until the Presentation of the said Thomas Chandler Curties to the Rectory 4 of Saint John the Baptist, Frenehay, the Tithes by such Order in Council appropriated to 4 the Parish of Saint John the Baptist, Frenehay, were received by the former Curate of the said Chapel of Frenehay, and since the Presentation of the said Thomas Chandler Curties

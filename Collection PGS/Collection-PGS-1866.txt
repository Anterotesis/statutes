Lands improved by such Drainage Works are allowed to c be injuriously affected by reason of the insufficient Main-c tenance of such Works; and the Trustees of the Districts in c which such Lands are included neglect in many Instances

to maintain or repair the said Works, and to take such Proceedings as may be necessary to secure the Lands in the c District against Deterioration arising from such Neglect, and

by reason thereof the said Lands are prejudicially affected as ' to the Security for the Repayment of such Expenditure,

Drainage Boards, and it is expedient that further Provision c should be made for the Maintenance of all such Drainage f Works executed under the Provisions of the said Acts, or c any of themBe it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

c And whereas many of the Locks and Works under their Control are in a very bad and dangerous Condition, and in consequence thereof and of other Causes the Traffic on the Part of the Thames under their Authority and their Receipts from Tolls leviable in respect of that Traffic are greatly diminished, and their Income is and has long been

c insufficient to defray the necessary Expenses of the Repair f and Maintenance of the Locks and Works, and they some f Time ago discharged all or many of the Workmen employed c by them, and reduced the Salaries of their Officers:

f And whereas the Conservancy of a Portion of the upper f Part of the Thames above the Flow of the Tide, namely, from f Teddington Lock in the County of Middlesex to Staines, is f vested in the Conservators of the River Thames (to whom the Term " the Conservators " where used in this Act refers): s And whereas it is expedient, with a view both to Economy f and to Efficiency, that the whole of the navigable Part of the f Thames be placed under One Management, and that accord-c ingly the Authority of the Upper Navigation Commissioners c be discontinued, and the Conservancy of the Thames from

Staines to Cricklade be vested in the Conservators with the f Powers in this Act expressed or referred to, Provision being ( made for the Election of Conservators as Representatives of

dient that the Exercise of those Rights be restricted and

regulated as in this Act provided:

And whereas certain Persons have or claim a Right or ' Privilege to fish with Nets or Bucks in Parts of the Thames c above Staines, and to draw down the Water of the River e for that Purpose, to the great Prejudice of the Navigation, and c it is expedient that any Right of drawing down Water for

that Purpose be abolished:

for preventing the Pollution of the Thames between Staines ( and the Western Boundary of the District under the Authority of the Metropolitan Board of Works be made to Parliament by the Conservators:

And whereas the Companies constituted for supplying

Water within the Metropolis, and drawing Water for that f Purpose from the Thames, namely, the Governor and Com-6 pany of Chelsea Waterworks, the Company of Proprietors of ' Lambeth Waterworks, the Grand Junction Waterworks Company, the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, and the c Company of Proprietors of the West Middlesex Waterworks c (in this Act referred to as the Five Metropolitan Water

c Companies), have, in consideration of the Benefits which will

6 accrue to them from this Act and the other Act so to be

applied for, consented to contribute as in this Act provided:

c And whereas the Upper Navigation Commissioners have

borrowed large Sums of Money under the Upper Navigation c Acts on Mortgage Security, and there now remains due by - them in respect thereof the Sum of Eighty-eight thousand c Pounds or thereabouts, but the Income of the Commissioners,

is and has long b$en insufficient to keep down the Interest c thereon, so that the Rate of Interest paid was for some Years ' gradually reduced until Payment of Interest ceased, and c considerable Sums are now due by the Commissioners for c Arrears of Interest:

' And whereas it is expedient that the Mortgage Debt con-c tracted by the Commissioners be postponed to any Mortgage ( Debt to be contracted by the Conservators, and that the f Arrears of Interest aforesaid be extinguished, and that other c Provisions be made respecting the Mortgage Debt contracted c by the Commissioners as in this Act expressedMay it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

General Police and Improvement (Scotland) Act,

1862.

(25 & 26 Vict. Cap. 101.)

Whereas by the General Police and Improvement (Scotland) Act, 1862, it is, inter alia, enacted, Section 79, that " whenever it appears desirable to the Magistrates and Council " or Commissioners of Police of any Royal or Parliamentary <e Burgh, or to the Commissioner3 for executing this Act in any <e Burgh or populous Place, that Provision should be made " in order the better to apply and execute therein the Pro-" visions of this Act in whole or in part, or for the future " Application and Execution of any Acts in force therein 6C having relation to the Purposes of this Act, or to the Roads " or Streets within such Burgh or populous Place, or to any (C other Matter or Thing connected with the Management (C and Administration of the Municipal or Police Affairs of " any such Burgh or populous Place, or that any such Acts or " any Exemptions from rating therefrom derived, or that any Provisional Order or Order in Council applying this Act " hereby authorized to be made, should be wholly or partially " repealed or altered/' ie the Magistrates and Council or the Commissioners of any Burgh, or the Magistrates and Coun-" cils or Commissioners of contiguous Burghs, as the Case may " be, may present a Petition to One of Her Majesty's Principal " Secretaries of State, praying for such Provision, Repeal, " and Alteration as aforesaid, or for any of such Things, <c and such Petition shall be supported by such Evidence as " the said Secretary requires:"

And whereas there is in said Burgh of Aberdeen a Board of Commissioners of Police separate from the Magistrates and Town Council of the said Burgh, which Board of Commissioners is appointed under and in virtue of a Local Act now in force (25 & 26 Vict. c. 203.), intituled " An Act for paving, cleansing, lighting, watching, draining, and improving the " City of Aberdeen and adjacent Districts, for regulating the " Police thereof, for supplying the Inhabitants with Water, " and for other Purposes," and which Act is herein-after referred to as the " Local Act ":

And whereas a Petition under the Provisions of the said General Police and Improvement (Scotland) Act has been addressed to me, as One of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, by the Commissioners under the said Local Act, praying that a Provisional Order may be issued in the Terms and to the Effect after expressed, and that the same may be thereafter confirmed by Act of Parliament:

And whereas due Inquiry has been directed and held in respect of the Matters mentioned in the said Petition:

Now,

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the Powers vested in me by the said General Police and Improvement (Scotland) Act,

1862, I, as One of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do, by this Provisional Order under my Hand and Seal of Office, direct that from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming the same, —

1. The Parts mentioned in the Schedule hereunto annexed of the " Aberdeen Police and Waterworks Act, 1862," being the Local Act 25 & 26 Victoria, Cap. 203., shall be repealed.

2. All the Provisions of the said Local Act which, if the Act to be passed confirming this Provisional Order had not been passed, would have been applicable or have referred to the Sewer Kates authorized by the said Local Act to be levied by way of District Assessment, shall, in so far as not inconsistent with this Provisional Order and the said Act to be passed, apply and refer to the Sewer Kates to be levied under the Authority of the said Local Act and of the said Act to be passed; and the said Local Act shall be read and construed as follows, that is to say, as if the Words "the Sewerage Department " had been inserted in Section 84 of such Act instead of the Words " each Drainage District" used in such Section; and as if the Words " within the Limits of this Act" had been inserted in Section 86 of such Act instead of the " Words "within each Drainage District within the Limits " of this Act to be formed as herein provided," used in such Section; and as if the Words " such Limits" had been inserted in such Section instead of the Words " such Drainage District " or " such District," whenever either of these Expressions is used in such Section; and as if the Words "by way of District Assessment in any Drainage District," used in Section 110 of such Act, had been omitted from such Section; and as if the Words "the Limits of this Act " had been inserted in such Section instead of the Words "such Drainage District" or "such District," wherever either of these Expressions is used in such Section; and as if the Words "Limits of this Act''had been inserted in Section 287 of such Act instead of the Words " Drainage District in which such Sewers are " respectively situated," used in such Section; and as if the Words " by way of District Assessment," where used in Schedule (B.) annexed to and referred to in such Act, and also the Word " District," where used in such Schedule, had been all omitted from such Schedule.

3. The Words "Commissioners," "Lands," "Premises/'

" Street," and " Person " in this Provisional Order shall, unless there be in the Subject or Context something repugnant thereto or inconsistent with such Construction, have the several Meanings assigned to them by the said Local Act.

4. Whereas the Commissioners have, in pursuance of the said Local Act, made a Division of the Territory within the Limits thereof into separate Drainage Districts: The said Local Act, and the Act to be passed confirming this Provisional

Order,

620

Cap. 93. Aberdeen Provisional Order Confirmation. 29 & 30 VICT.

Order, shall be carried into execution to the like Effect and in the same Way as if such Division had not been made.

5. Notwithstanding anything contained in the said Local Act, all Sewers and Drains in or under any public Street within the Limits of the said Local Act, as thereby defined, and not already by such Act vested in the Commissioners, shall (with the Exception of the Sewers or Culverts constructed by and belonging to the Commissioners of the Harbour and Docks of Aberdeen) vest in and belong to and be under the Management and Control of the Commissioners: Provided always, that the Commissioners shall be bound to make Compensation to the Owner of such Sewers or Drains hereby vested in the Commissioners, so far as such Sewers or Drains may be private Property, for the Value of his Eight and Interest therein, which Compensation shall be settled in the same Manner as Compensation for Land to be taken under the Provisions of " The Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act, 1845," is directed to be settled: Provided also, that in settling the Amount of such Compensation regard shall be had to, and a reasonable Abatement shall be made therefrom in respect of, the Rights, if any, which may have been previously acquired by any Person to use such old Sewer: Provided also, that any Person who may have acquired perpetual Right to use such Sewers or Drains hereby vested in the Commissioners previous to the Date at which the Act confirming this Provisional Order shall come into operation within the Territory within which such Sewers or Drains are situate shall be entitled to use the same, or any other Sewer to be substituted in lieu thereof, in as full and ample a Manner as he would or might have done if this Provisional Order had not been made.

6. Notwithstanding anything in the said Local Act contained, it shall be lawful to the Commissioners, if it shall be necessary for the Purpose of carrying any Sewer or other Works into or through any enclosed or other Lands as authorized by Section 282 of such Act to be done, to stop up, alter, or remove any private Sewer or Drain within such Lands, not being a Sewer or Drain, if such there be, made and used for the Purpose of draining, preseving, or improving Land under any Local or Private Act of Parliament: Provided always, that if any Person shall, by means of such stopping up. Alteration, or Removal, be deprived of the Use of any such Sewer or Drain which such Person was theretofore lawfully entitled to use, the Commissioners shall provide some other Sewer or Drain equally effectual for such Pm pose; and the Provisions of Section 285 of the said Local Act shall extend and apply to the Case where any Person has by such Means been deprived of such Use.

7. If in making any Main or other Sewers, or in repairing, reconstructing, or enlarging the same, or any existing Drains or Sewers, the Contents at present carried into any existing Outlet shall be diverted therefrom to the Prejudice of any actual existing legal Right, the Commissioners shall be bound

to

"1866. Aberdeen Provisional Order Confirmation. Cap. 93.

to make Compensation therefor, which Compensation shall be settled in the same Manner as Compensation for Land to be taken under the Provisions of the said Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act is directed to be settled.

8. The Sewer Rates and Private Assessment to be imposed or levied under the Authority of the said Local Act and of the Act to be passed confirming this Order shall, with the legal Interest thereon from the Time when the same shall be declared payable, together with all Expenses incurred in the Recovery thereof, continue Burdens on the Premises liable for the same, or in respect of which the same shall be payable, but that only for Three Years from the Date when the same shall be respectively paj'able, as against bona fide singular Successors or Heritable Creditors: Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall affect the Rights and Remedies of Superiors for the Recovery of their Feu Duties and Casualties.

9. The Act to be passed confirming this Provisional Order shall be construed together with the said Local Act as One Act, and for this Purpose the Expression " this Act," when used in the said Local Act, shall be taken to include the said Act to be passed.

Provisional Order for the Alteration and Amendment of the Ramsgate Improvement Act, 1838, in force within the District of the Ramsgate Local Board.

Whereas the Commissioners acting in execution of a certain Local Act of Parliament passed in the first and second years of the reign of Her present Majesty (cap. 70.), intituled " An Act for better paving, lighting, watching, and improving of. the Parish of Ramsgate in the County of Kent, and for " regulating the Police thereof," have duly adopted the Local Government Act, 1858, in and for the said Parish of Ramsgate: And whereas the said Commissioners acting as a Local Board under and for the purposes of the Local Government Act, in pursuance of the said Act, presented a Petition to me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, praying for the alteration, amendment, and partial repeal of the said Local Act, being an Act in force within the said District having relation to the purposes of the Local Government Act, and not conferring powers or privileges upon any corporation, company, undertakers, or individuals, for their own pecuniary benefit, and for other purposes in such Petition set forth; and such alteration, amendment, and partial repeal of the said Local Act were effected by a Provisional Order, under my hand, confirmed by the Local Government Supplemental Act, 1865 (No. 5.):

And whereas the said Commissioners acting as such Local Board have now presented a further Petition to me, praying for a further partial repeal of the said Local Act, and for other purposes in such Petition set forth; and it appears expedient to issue a Provisional Order in relation to the said Petition, but no such Order can be valid without the confirmation of Parliament:

Now, therefore, I, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, and in pursuance of the powers vested in me [No. 63. Price 2dJ\ 3 R by

That from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this Order, —

further altered and amended as follows, and shall be read and have effect accordingly: —

The 61st section of the said Local Act (partially altered by the Provisional Order dated the second day of June One thousand eight hundred and sixty-five) shall be further altered as follows; that is to say, instead of the words " loitering or remaining now forming part of such section, the words " loiter or remain " shall be substituted, and also by inserting therein after the words " upon any footway or causeway," now forming part of that section, the words " road, lane, square, or passage, whether a thoroughfare or not," and by inserting therein before the words " to the common danger of passengers/' now also forming part of the same section, the word "or," and by inserting therein before the words " or make or assist in making any bonfire," now also forming part of that section, the words "or who (not being the Common Crier, and lawfully engaged) shall ring or sound or use, or cause to be rung or sounded, any bell or other noisy instrument for the purpose of calling persons together, or for announcing any show or entertainment, or of hawking, selling, distributing, or collecting any article whatever."

2. — So much of section 83 of the said Local Act as relates

And whereas the provisions contained in the said Section of such Act, so far as the same are applicable to that portion of the non-corporate part of the aforesaid District of Banbury therein mentioned which is situated in the County of Northampton have been found to operate unfairly and oppressively as between the ratepayers of and in such portion who are now by law assessed at the full net annual value of their property, and the ratepayers of and in such portion who are now by law assessed at one fourth of the full net annual value of their

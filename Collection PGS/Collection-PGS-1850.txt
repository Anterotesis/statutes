' King George the Fourth should be repealed, but nevertheless ' not so as to affect or prejudice the Application for or the

Payment of Bounty under the said Act, or any of the Pro-(visions relating thereto, for any Service rendered against

Pirates on or before the said First Day of June; and by the c said Act so passed as aforesaid it was also enacted, that when-(ever any of Her Majesty's Ships or Vessels of War, or hired c armed Vessels, or any of the Ships or Vessels of War of the c East India Company, or their Boats, or any of the Officers or ' Crews thereof, should after the said First Day of June attack

or be engaged with any Persons alleged to be Pirates, afloat

or ashore, it should be lawful for the High Court of Admi-c ralty, and for the Courts of Vice Admiralty therein men-i tioned, to take cognizance of and to determine the Matters c in the said Act mentioned: And whereas the Bill which ' became the said Act so passed as aforesaid was originally

introduced in the House of Commons, and having passed ' that House was amended by the Lords, and was returned to

the Commons for their Agreement to the Amendments: And

whereas the Commons agreed to some of the said Amendments, but disagreed to One of the said Amendments and c amended another thereof, and communicated their Amendment and Disagreement and the Reason for such Disagreement to the Lords at a Conference on the Twenty-eighth ' Day of May One thousand eight hundred and fifty: And whereas the Lords did not take the said Reason and Amend-

ments into consideration until the Twenty-first Day of June One thousand eight hundred and fifty, when they finally

agreed to the said Amendment of the Commons, and resolved ' not to insist upon the Amendment to which the Commons had c disagreed; and accordingly the said Act received the Royal

Assent on the Twenty-fifth Day of June One thousand eight

hundred and fifty: And whereas by reason of the said Act ' not having received the Royal Assent until the said Twenty- fifth Day of June One thousand eight hundred and fifty, the ' herein-before recited Enactments will not take effect until the 6 First Day of June One thousand eight hundred and fifty-one: 6 And whereas such Postponement of the Operation of the said ' Enactments was not within the Contemplation of either House

of Parliament when they respectively passed the said Act, but ' has arisen accidentally from the Delay occasioned by the Pro-

ceedings herein-before mentioned; and it is expedient that ' the said Enactments should be made to take effect as if the c First Day of June One thousand eight hundred and fifty had been therein mentioned instead of the First Day of June next

after the passing of the said recited Act:' Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said recited Act of the present Session of Parliament shall take effect as if the First Day of June One thousand eight hundred and fifty had been therein

the Mayor of such Borough, of the Cause of Action in ' manner therein provided, and that thereupon it should be c lawful for such Recorder or Mayor to issue an Attachment,

' to be directed to the proper Officer of the Court, to attach

the Goods of the Defendant within the Borough; and there-

upon such Officer is by the said Act authorized and required ' to seize such Goods and to detain the same until the Defendant shall have given Special Bail to pay such Sum of Money ' as may be adjudged to the Plaintiff in that Suit: And whereas it is expedient to amend the Law relating to Proceedings by Attachment of Goods to compel Appearance in

Special Bail shall be given by the Defendant to pay all such Debt, Damages, Expenses, and Costs as shall be adjudged in that Cause to the Plaintiff against the Defendant, or to render the Body of the Defendant into the Custody of the Marshal of the Marshalsea of the Four Courts of the City of Dublin, in case the Action shall be pending in the Court of the Borough of Dublin, or other Prison as herein-after provided of the Court out of which such Attachment shall issue, as the Case may be.

specti^ely therein recited or mentioned, and the said Act of 1 th* Sixth Year of the Reign of Her present Majesty, or under some or one of the said several Acts respectively, upon ' or in respect of certain Deeds or Instruments herein-after mentioned, and it is proper that such Doubts should be re-

And whereas Doubts are entertained whether such Progressive Duties are chargeable on any Deed or Instrument in respect of the Words contained in any other Deed or Instrument liable to Stamp Duty and duly stamped which may be put or endorsed upon or annexed to or referred to in or by such first-mentioned Deed or Instrument, and it is expedient to remove such Doubts:9 Be it therefore declared and enacted, That the said Progressive Duties shall not be deemed or held to be or to have been imposed or chargeable upon any Deed or Instrument in respect of the Words or any Quantity of the Words contained in any other Deed or Instrument liable to Stamp Duty and duly stamped which may be or may have been put or endorsed upon or annexed to such first-mentioned Deed or Instrument, or which may be or may have been in any Manner incorporated with or referred to in or by the same.

XII. And whereas, for securing the due Payment of the Stamp Duties imposed by Law on Deeds and other Instruments, it is expedient to alter the Terms and Conditions on which any such Deed or Instrument may be stamped after the Execution or signing thereof:9 Be it therefore enacted. That where any Deed or Instrument liable by Law to any Stamp Duty shall be written on Vellum, Parchment, or Paper, and shall be signed or executed by any Person before such Vellum, Parchment, or Paper shall be duly stamped for denoting the Payment of the said Duty, then and in every such Case there shall be due, answered, and paid to Her Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors, the whole or (as the Case may be) the Deficiency of the Stamp Duty payable upon or in respect of such

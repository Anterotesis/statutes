or they may be under other Circumstances in which they will not be subject to the Laws

relating to the Government of Her Majesty's Forces by Sea: And whereas no Man can ' be forejudged of Life or Limb, or subjected in Time of Peace to any Kind of Punishment

within this Realm, by Martial Law, or in any other Manner than by the Judgment of his c Peers, and according to the known and established Laws of this Realm; yet nevertheless it being requisite for the retaining of such Forces in their Duty that an exact Discipline

be observed, and that Marines wrho shall mutiny or stir up Sedition, or shall desert Her Majesty's Service, or be guilty of any other Crime or Offence in breach of or to the e Prejudice of good Order and Discipline, be brought to a more exemplary and speedy c Punishment than the usual Forms of the Law will allow:' Be it therefore enacted by the Queens most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

2. All Crimes and Offences committed against any former Act made for the Regulation of the Royal Marine Forces while on shore, or against any of the Rules, Regulations, or Articles of War made and established by virtue of the same, may, during the Continuance of this Act, be tried, inquired of, and punished in like Manner as if they had been committed against this Act; and every Warrant for holding any Court-martial under any former Act shall remain in full Force, notwithstanding the Expiration of such Act; and all Proceedings of any Court-martial upon any Trial begun under the Authority of such former Act shall not be discontinued by the Expiration of the same: Provided always, that no Person shall be liable to be tried and punished for any Offence against any of the said Acts or Articles of War which shall appear to have been committed more than

[22d June 1863.]

WHEREAS an Act, to which the Term The Dockyards Protection Act when herein-c after used refers, was passed in the Fifty-fourth Year of Ring George the Third, ' (Chapter One hundred and fifty-nine,) " For the better Regulation of the several Ports, ' ts Harbours, Roadsteads, Sounds, Channels, Bays, and navigable Rivers in the United c C(Kingdom, and of His Majesty's Docks, Dockyards, Arsenals, Wharfs, Moorings, and ' " Stores therein, and for repealing several Acts made for that Purpose j"

And whereas by the said Act (among other things) Authority was given for the tasking

of Rules, Orders, and Regulations for the Preservation of His Majesty's Moorings, and for the mooring, anchoring, and placing of private Ships and Craft in the Ports, Harbours, ' Havens, Roadsteads, Sounds, Channels, Creeks, Bays, and navigable Rivers of the United Kingdom, so far as the Tide flows and reflows, where or near to which His Majesty then had, or where His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, might thereafter have any ' Docks, Dockyards, Arsenals, Wharfs, or Mooring for the Purpose of ensuring free and (safe Ingress, Egress, and Regress unto, into, and from those Ports and Waters, and to and ' from His Majesty's Docks and other Property aforesaid therein, and for the ordering and

marking out of such Spaces near the same as should be judged necessary to be kept free ' and open, and for the Appropriation of Mooring Places for His Majesty's Ships, and for ' the specifying of Distances from His Majesty's Ships, Hulks, Docks, and other Property

aforesaid within which no private Ship or Craft should be moored, anchored, or placed, and for the altering from Time to Time of such Rules, Orders, and Regulations as Occasion should require for the Purposes aforesaid; all which Rules, Orders, and Regulations it was

thereby enacted should, upon the making thereof, and also whenever altered, be published ' in the London Gazette, and, being printed and put upon Pasteboard, should be constantly

kept hung up in some open and conspicuous Part of the Custom House or other Place of ' public Resort for Business in the Port, Harbour, or Haven affected:

And whereas in the same Act Provision was also made, by the Imposition of pecuniary ' Penalties and otherwise, for (among other things) the preventing of private Ships or f Craft from being moored, anchored, or placed in the Fairway or Channel or across the

Stream in any such Port, Harbour, Haven, or navigable River, so as to obstruct the

Passage or Entrance into the same, and for the Removal of private Ships and Craft from r prohibited Positions, and for confining the breaming of Ships to particular Parts of the ' Shore, and for restricting the carrying of Gunpowder and the keeping of Fire on board (Ship, and the heating of Pitch or other combustible Matter on board Ship within the specified Distances of His Majesty's Ships, Dockyards, and other Property, and the f keeping of shotted Guns and the firing of Guns on board Ship in such Waters as

aforesaid:

CAnd whereas it may in some Instances be also desirable, with a view to the better ' Protection of Her Majesty's Ships and Property in Her Dockyards and Naval Stations, ' and to the Interests of Her Majesty's Naval Service, that there should be Authority for ' the making of Rules, Orders, and Regulations in manner directed by the Dockyards ' Protection Act, for restricting the Speed of Steamers within Harbours under particular f Circumstances or in particular Positions, and for enforcing the constant Attendance of

Shipkeepers on board Vessels within Harbours near Her Majesty's Dockyards and ' Naval Stations: '

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Adtidd and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

1. Any Rules, Orders, and Regulations from Time to Time made under the Dockyards Protection Act may, where it seems expedient with a view to the better Protection of Her Majesty's Ships, Dockyards, or Property, or to the Requirements of Her Majesty's

26° & 27° VICTORIAE, c. 30, 31.

Naval Service, extend, in addition to the Purposes in that Act mentioned, to the following Purposes, or either of them; namely,

(1.) To prohibit the navigating of Steam Vessels at a greater Speed than Five Nautical Miles an Hour in any specified Part of any Port, Harbour, Haven, or navigable River for which under the Dockyards Protection Act Rules, Orders, and Regulations may be made:

(2.) To require the Presence of at least One Person at all Hours of the Day and Night on board every Ship or Vessel, Lighter, Barge, or other Craft above a specified Size, anchored, moored, or placed in any specified Part of any such Port, Harbour, Haven, or navigable River.

2. Any such Rules, Orders, and Regulations may impose such reasonable pecuniary Penalties as may seem fit, not exceeding Five Pounds for each Breach thereof, but they shall be so framed as to allow the Justices or other Authority before whom any such Penalty is sought to be recovered to order Part only of the Penalty to be paid.

3. Every such Penalty shall be recoverable and applicable as pecuniary Penalties under the Dockyards Protection Act, and any Act amending the same, are recoverable and applicable. The Provisions of the Dockyards Protection Act respecting the Indemnity of Persons acting in pursuance thereof shall apply to Persons acting in pursuance of Rules, Orders, and Regulations made under the Authority of this Act; and generally, as far as may be, this Act shall be construed together with the Dockyards Protection Act, and any Act amending the same, as one Act.

BRADFORD.

Provisional Order putting in force the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, within the District of the Bradford Local Board of Health for the Purchase of Land by the said Board for Street Improvements. — Local Government Act, 1858.

Whereas the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the Borough of Bradford in the county of York, by the Council of the said Borough, the said Council being the Local Board of Health for the District of the Borough aforesaid, have, in pursuance of the provisions of the 75th section of the Local Government Act, 1858, and after complying with the requirements of that section by duly giving and serving all notices thereby directed, presented a Petition to me as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, for authority to put in force the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, to enable the aforesaid Local Board of Health to purchase certain pieces of land and certain buildings for the purpose of carrying out certain street improvements within the District of the said Local Board of Health.

And whereas the said Petition duly set forth the pieces of land and the buildings intended to be taken by such Board for such purpose, and the names of the owners, lessees, and occupiers of the aforesaid land and buildings who have assented, dissented, and are neuter in respect of the taking thereof, or who have returned no answer to the notices issued by such Board; and such Petition prayed that the said Board might, with reference to such lands and buildings, be allowed to put in force the powers of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act aforesaid, with respect to the purchase and taking of land otherwise than by agreement; and on the receipt of such Petition I, as Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department, directed William Ranger, Esquire, the Inspector appointed for the purpose, to visit the said District, and the said Inspector has now inquired in the District aforesaid into the subject matter of such Petition, and has duly reported thereon.

Now, therefore, I, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do hereby, in

Siance of the powers vested in me by the Local Government Act, 1858, make Order and t, —

That from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this Order, —

1. — The Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the Borough of Bradford in the county of York, being the Local Board of Health for the District of the said Borough, shall be empowered to put in force, with reference to the lands and buildings referred to and described in the Schedule to this Order annexed, the powers of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, with respect to the purchase and taking of land otherwise than by agreement.

Given under my hand this 21st day of March 1863.

CAP. XLVI.

An Act for further continuing and appropriating the London Coal and Wine Duties.

[13th July 1863.]

WHEREAS by The London Coal and Wine Duties Continuance Act, 1861, the 24 & 25 Vict. Local Coal and Wine Duties therein mentioned, being Four Shillings a Tun on 42-

Wines, and One Penny and Twelvepence a Ton on Coals, Culm, and Cinders, were continued until the Fifth Day of July One thousand eight hundred and seventy-two; and by the same Act the Proceeds of the said Wine Duty, and of the said Coal Duty of One Penny, and of the Duty of Eightpence, Part of the said Coal Duty of Twelvepence, were directed (after Satisfaction of certain Charges) to be paid to an Account to be opened in the Name of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury at the Bank of England, to be intituled The Thames Embankment and Metropolis Improvement Fund, and to be applied to the Improvement of the Metropolis in such Manner as might thereafter be determined by Parliament:

And whereas by the same Act the Proceeds of the Duty of Fourpence, Residue of the said Coal Duty of Twelvepence (after Payment of certain Charges thereon), were directed to be applied by the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of the City of London towards or in aid of such Public Improvements in or adjacent to the said City as Parliament should thereafter sanction:

And whereas by The Thames Embankment Act, 1862, the Metropolitan Board of 25 & 26 Vict. Works were authorized to make an Embankment on the Left Bank of the Thames Ct 93, from Westminster Bridge to the Eastern Boundary of the Inner Temple, and a Viaduct thence to Blackfriars Bridge, with a public Roadway on the Embankment and on the Viaduct:

And whereas by the said Embankment Act of 1862 it was provided that (subject to certain Charges) all Expenses incurred in carrying that Act into effect should be defrayed out of the said Improvement Fund, or Money to be borrowed on the Security thereof, and the said Board were empowered to borrow on that Security any Sum not exceeding One million Pounds:

And whereas a Bill has been introduced into Parliament in the present Session for making a new Street from Blackfriars to the Mansion House in the City of London, in connexion with the Embankment of the River Thames on the Northern Side of that River; and for other Purposes:

And whereas, with a view of making a general Fund for defraying the Expenses of carrying into effect the Objects of the said Bill, as well as the Purposes of the Embankment Act of 1862, it is proposed by the said Bill that the said Board should be authorized to borrow under the Provisions of the Embankment Act of 1862 the Sum of Two million Pounds instead of the Sum of One million Pounds:

And whereas several Works have been recommended for the Improvement of the Metropolis by the Commissioners appointed by Her Majesty to examine Plans for embanking the Surrey Side of the River Thames within the Metropolis, and by the Commissioners appointed to consider the Advantages and Cost of different Plans calculated to relieve the overcrowding of existing Thoroughfares, and to conduce to the Convenience of the Public and the Embellishment of the Metropolis:

CoalDuty of Ad. to be applied by Corporation of London to Holborn Hill Improvements.

[Short Title.]

26° & 27° VICTORIAE, c. 46, 47.

And whereas it would greatly conduce to the Convenience of the Public and to the e Accommodation of Metropolitan Traffic if Alterations and Improvements were made in ' and adjacent to Holborn Hill and Skinner Street, by the raising of Holborn Valley:

And whereas it is apprehended that the Proceeds of the said Coal and Wine Duties as ' continued by the said Continuance Act of 1861 will be insufficient for the Purposes

aforesaid, and it is therefore expedient to continue the same from the said Fifth Day of ' July One thousand eight hundred and seventy-two for a further Period of Ten Years, for the Purpose of providing Means to defray the Expenses of the Undertakings aforesaid, (including the Alterations and Improvements aforesaid in and adjacent to Holborn Hill and ' Skinner Street: '

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

1. All Duties by The London Coal and Wine Duties Continuance Act, 1861, continued until the Fifth Day of July One thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, and all Acts relating thereto, shall be continued until the Fifth Day of July One thousand eight hundred and eighty-two; and The London Coal and Wine Duties Continuance Act, 1861, shall be read as if the Fifth Day of July One thousand eight hundred and eighty-two had been substituted throughout that Act for the Fifth Day of July One thousand eight hundred and seventy-two.

2. The net Proceeds of the Duty of Fourpence, Part of the Duty of Twelvepence, on Coal, Culm, and Citiders, continued by this Act until the Fifth Day of July One thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, shall during the Continuance thereof be applied by the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of the City of London in the first instance in Payment of the Interest and in discharge of so much of the Principal of the several Sums mentioned in the Sixth Section of The London Coal and Wine Duties Continuance Act, 1861, as now remains unpaid; and an Account of the Receipt and Application of such Duty of Fourpence shall be kept separate and distinct from the Accounts of the said Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens, and an Abstract of the said Account shall be annually laid by the Chamberlain of the said City before both Houses of Parliament; and after discharging the said Sums and Interest, and in the meantime subject thereto, the said Duty of Fourpence shall be applied by the Corporation of London in the fitst instance towards or in aid of the raising of Holborn Valley, and afterwards to such other public Improvement or Improvements in or adjacent to the City of London as Parliament shall hereafter sanction.

3. This Act may be cited as The London Coal and Wine Duties Continuance Act, 1863.

CAP. XLVII.

An Act for removing Doubts as to the Powers of the Courts of the Church of Scotland, and extending the Powers of the said Courts.

[13th July 1863.]

WHEREAS it would much conduce to the Interests of Religion were Ministers of ' Parishes .against whom a Libel has been found relevant for alleged immoral Conduct, ' or for alleged Error in Doctrine, to abstain from exercising Ministerial Functions until ' the said Libel has been disposed of by final Sentence; but Doubts exist whether the (Right of the Courts of the Church of Scotland to require and enjoin Ministers of Parishes ' so to abstain from Ministerial Functions in such Circumstances may not be liable to legal ' Impediment, and it is desirable to remove such Doubts: And whereas it is expedient to ' declare the said Right, and farther to declare the Right of the Presbyteries of the said c Church to make Provision for supplying the Ordinances of Religion in any Parish where the said Ordinances have ceased to be performed by the Minister thereof:' Be it therefore declared and enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and

Consent

And whereas a Petition under the said General Police and Improvement (Scotland) Act has been addressed to me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, praying for the repeal and alteration of certain portions of the said Local Act, and that provision may be made in respect thereto.

And whereas it is desirable to state the parts of the said Local Police Act which relate to matters not provided for by the Act so adopted as aforesaid, and remaining in force notwithstanding such adoption, and that provision should otherwise be made to regulate the future application and execution of the said General Act and the other Act above referred to now in force within the said Burgh.

3. — During the currency of the said period the said roads or streets shall be properly paved, and at the expiry of the said seven years the said assessment shall cease and determine, and thereafter the said roads or streets shall be maintained and dealt with in the same

_ manner as the other streets of the Burgh, and all funds and all obligations applicable to the said other streets in the Burgh shall be applicable to the said roads or streets.

2. Section Three of the Act of the Eighth and Ninth Years of Her Majesty, Chapter One hundred and seventeen, shall be deemed to have applied and to apply to Ireland as well as to England.

3. Section Four of the same Act is hereby repealed.

4. Any Person being employed in the Execution of a Warrant, duly issued under the Authority of the said Acts or either of them, who shall wilfully desert any Person mentioned therein before he or she shall have been conveyed to the Place of Destination, shall be guilty of a Misdemeanor, and upon Conviction thereof shall be liable to a Fine not exceeding Ten Pounds, and, in default of Payment, to Imprisonment for a Term not exceeding Three Months.

7. If the Board of Guardians of any Union in Ireland think themselves aggrieved by the Removal of any poor Person, and if they forward to the Poor Law Commissioners for Ireland a Statement of the Grounds for concluding that such poor Person is legally settled in any Parish or Township in England, or was not in Law liable to be removed to Ireland, and if such Board of Guardians, or any Person on their Behalf, shall agree to pay all Costs which may be incurred in any necessary preliminary Inquiry, and in the Appeal against the Warrant for the Removal of such poor Person, such Commissioners, if satisfied that it will be expedient to do so, may appoint some Person to make a preliminary Inquiry into the Circumstances attending such Removal, and after such Inquiry may, if they think fit, appeal on behalf of the Guardians so aggrieved to the Court of Quarter Sessions held for the County or Borough within which the Parish or Township from which such Removal was made is situate, at any Time within Six Months after such Removal was completed; and such Commissioners shall, at least Twenty-one Days before the holding of such Sessions, send by Post to the Guardians or Overseers on whose Application such Warrant was obtained Notice in Writing purporting to be signed by their Secretary or Chief Clerk of their Intention to appeal against such Warrant, containing a Statement in Writing of the Grounds of such Appeal, and such Court of Quarter Sessions shall hear and determine such Appeal; and if the Warrant of Removal be reversed or declared illegal by such Court, the Guardians or Overseers on whose Application the same was obtained shall pay the Costs and Expenses incurred by or on account of such Board of Guardians, both for the preliminary Inquiry and the Appeal, and for the Maintenance of such poor Person, and for conveying such Person back to the Parish or Township in England from which the Removal was made; and if such Guardians or Overseers neglect or refuse to pay such Costs and Expenses within Seven Days after Demand thereof, the Guardians on whose Behalf such Appeal was made, or any Person authorized by them, may recover the same as a Debt in a Court of Law in England: Provided always, that the said Guardians or Overseers may, at any Time after such Notice of Appeal, send by Post Notice in Writing under the Hands of any Two or more of them to the said Commissioners that they abandon such Warrant, and thereupon such Warrant shall be of no Effect; and such Guardians or Overseers shall pay to the Guardians on whose Behalf such Notice of Appeal was given, or to some Person authorized by them, the Expenses incurred by them or on their Account by reason of such Warrant, apd of the preliminary Inquiry, and of any Proceedings consequent thereon, and the actual Expenses and Charges of maintaining such poor Person, and of conveying such poor Person back to such Parish or Township, and if they do not pay the same within Seven Days after Demand the same may be recovered as a Debt in a Court of Law in England: Provided also, that if on the Hearing of the Appeal Judgment shall be given against the Appellants, the Respondents shall be entitled to recover the Costs which they have incurred in and about the Appeal from such Appellants.

An Act for consolidating in One Act certain Provisions frequently inserted in Acts relating to Waterworks.

[28th July 1863.]

WHEREAS The Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, was passed in order to comprise in One Act sundry Provisions which were at the Time of the passing of that Act usually introduced into Acts of Parliament authorizing the Construction of certain Waterworks:

And whereas sundry Provisions of the like Nature, but not comprised in the said Act, are now frequently introduced into Acts of Parliament relating to Waterworks, and it is expedient to comprise such last-mentioned Provisions also in One Act, and that as well for the Purpose of avoiding the Necessity of repeating such Provisions in Special Acts relating to Waterworks, as for ensuring greater Uniformity in the Provisions themselves Be it therefore enacted by the Queens most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice

and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, a3 follows:

Preliminary.

1. This Act may be cited as The Waterworks Clauses Act, 1863; and The Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, and this Act may be cited together as the Waterworks Clauses Acts, 1847 and 1863.

2. This Act shall apply to any Waterworks to which any Special Act hereafter passed and incorporating this Act relates; and every such Special Act is herein-after referred to as " the Special Act."

Terms used in this Act have the same Meanings as the same Terms have when used in The Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847.

The Provisions respecting the Recovery of Penalties contained in the last-mentioned Act shall be incorporated with this Act.

Security of Reservoirs.

And with respect to the Security of the Reservoirs constructed by the Undertakers, be it enacted as follows:

3. Whenever any Person interested complains to Two Justices that any Reservoir constructed by the Undertakers is in a dangerous State, such Justices shall forthwith make Inquiry into the Truth of the Complaint; or Two Justices, on their own View, and without Complaint by any Person, may proceed under the present Provisions as if a Complaint had been so made to them.

4. If, on any such Inquiry, the Justices are satisfied that the Complaint is well founded, and that the Reservoir is in a dangerous State, and that the Danger is so imminent as not to admit of Delay in removing the Cause of Complaint, they shall order such Person as they think fit to enter on the Property of the Undertakers, and to lower the Water in the Reservoir, and to execute and do all such Works and Things as the Justices think requisite and proper for removing the Cause of Complaint.

5. If, on any such Inquiry, the Justices are satisfied that there is good Cause of Complaint, but are not satisfied that the Reservoir is in such an imminently dangerous State as not to admit of Delay in removing the Cause of Complaint, they shall issue their Summons to the Undertakers to answer the Complaint; and upon hearing the Parties, the Justices may, or upon Default of Appearance of the Undertakers, then in their Absence, the Justices shall, order the Undertakers, within such Period as the Justices think reasonable and specify in the Order, to lower the Water in the Reservoir, and to execute and do all such Works and Things as the Justices think requisite and proper for removing the Cause of Complaint.

If the Undertakers fail to execute or do within that Period any such Work or Thing, the Justices who made the Order, or any other Two Justices, on being satisfied of such

26° & 27° VICTORIA c. 93. 421

Failure, may either order such Persons as the Justices think fit to enter on the Property of Undertakers to the Undertakers, and to lower the Water in the Reservoir, and to execute and do all such rePftir-Works and Things as the Justices think requisite and proper for removing the Cause of Complaint; or may, if they-think fit, by Order impose on the Undertakers a Penalty, not exceeding Ten Pounds, for every Day during which such Failure continues after the making of the Order imposing the Penalty.

6. Any Order of Justices made in any of the Cases aforesaid shall be in Writing under Form of Order, their Hands, and may be in the Form set forth in the Schedule to this Act, with such Variations as Circumstances require.

7. Any Person acting under and in pursuance of any such Order shall not be deemed a Persons acting Trespasser; and if any Person wilfully obstructs any Person lawfully acting in obedience |Jot Tj^- to any such Order, or wilfully does, or instigates, or suffers to be done, anything in papers, contravention thereof, he shall for every such Offence be liable to a Penalty not exceeding

Fifty Pounds.

8. The Justices may order all, or such Part as they think fit, of the Costs of and incident Order for Pay-to the applying for and obtaining of any such Order to be paid by the Undertakers, and Expenses also all, or such Part as the Justices think fit, of the Expenses of the Works and Things executed and done in pursuance of any such Order by any Person other than the Undertakers, to be paid by the Undertakers to such Person as the Justices appoint.

If the Justices before whom the Complaint is made think that there is no sufficient Ground for the Complaint, they may, if they think fit, order the Complainant to pay to the Undertakers the whole or any Part of their Costs of or incident to the Complaint.

9. If the Undertakers consider themselves aggrieved by any Order or Determination of Appeal by Justices under the present Provisions, they may in like Manner and subject to the like Undertaker8-Conditions as by The Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, are provided in the Case

of Appeals in respect of Penalties, appeal to the Court of General or Quarter Sessions for the County or Place where the Cause of Appeal arises; and that Court may, on the Hearing of the Appeal, either affirm or quash the Order or Determination, or make such other Order in the Premises as may seem fit, and may make such Order as to the Costs, both of the original Proceedings and of the Appeal, as may seem fit; but the Order or Determination appealed against shall, pending the Appeal, continue in force.

10. Notwithstanding anything in the Special Act contained, the Undertakers shall not Undertakers be liable to pay any Damages, Penalties, Costs, Charges, or Expenses for or in respect of, notI^b^ or be answerable or accountable for, any Diminution or Cessation of the Supply of Water,

Or any other Breach or Nonperformance of their or any of their Duties, Liabilities, or of Order. Obligations under the Special Act, that may be occasioned by or result from the Execution of any such Order.

Two Justices; and the Appeal given shall lie from Two Justices in manner provided by Sections One hundred and fifty-one and One hundred and fifty-two of The Railways Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act, 1845, and shall lie from a Sheriff Substitute to the Sheriff Depute, where the Matter comes in the first instance before a Sheriff Substitute; and in that Case the Sheriff Depute shall hear and determine the Appeal, and may either confirm, recall, vary, or supersede the Order of the Sheriff Substitute as he thinks proper; and the Costs of the Appeal shall be in the Discretion of the Sheriff; and the Order or Judgment of the Sheriff in the Appeal shall be final.

Provisional Order of the Board of Trade for the Construction, Maintenance, and Regulation of Docks at Instate, in the County of Devon.

[Preamble.]

Whereas, under The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, and The General Pier and

Harbour Act, 1861, Amendment Act, the promoters of the North Devon Dock made application by a Memorial to the Lords of the Committee of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council appointed for the consideration of matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations, herein-after called the Board of Trade, setting forth the necessity of a Dock at Instow, in the County of Devon, and praying their Lordships to approve of the project thus submitted, and to grant a Provisional Order for its execution, containing all such powers

and

26° & 27° VICTORIAE, c. 104.

and privileges for the complete execution of the works, and for the levying of tolls, rates, and duties, not exceeding those in the Schedules to the advertisement published by them according to the requirements of the said Acts, and for the incorporation of a Company for the objects assigned:

And whereas the estimated expenditure on the proposed works is sixty thousand pounds and no more:

And whereas the promoters published the advertisements and deposited the documents which, by the last-mentioned Act, they were required to publish and deposit:

And whereas the Board of Trade, after making such inquiries as they have thought expedient, have settled this present Provisional Order, and intend to cause a Bill to be introduced into Parliament for the purpose of obtaining an Act for the confirmation of this Provisional Order (until which confirmation this Provisional Order will not be of any validity or force whatever):

Now, therefore, the Board of Trade do, by this their Provisional Order, in pursuance of The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, and The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, Amendment Act, and by virtue and in exercise of the powers thereby respectively in them vested, and of every other power enabling them in this behalf, order —

That, from and immediately after the passing of an Act of Parliament confirming this Provisional Order, +he following provisions shall take effect and be in force: —

North Devon Dock Company.

1. The following persons, namely, George Braginton, James Peard Ley, Thomas Burnard Chanter, and all other persons and corporations who have subscribed or may subscribe to the undertaking authorized by this Order, and their executors, administrators, successors, and assigns respectively, shall be and are hereby constituted into a Company for the purpose of making and maintaining the docks and works authorized by this Order, and for the other purposes of this Order; and for those purposes shall be and are hereby incorporated by the name of The North Devon Dock Company; and by that name shall be one body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal, and with power to purchase, take, hold and dispose of lands and other property, for the purposes but subject to the restrictions of this Order.

2. The North Devon Dock Company, herein-after called the Company, shall be the undertakers of the works authorized by this Order.

3. The Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, shall be incorporated with this Order.

4; The capital of the Company shall be the sum of sixty thousand pounds, in six thousand shares of ten pounds each. Of that sum forty thousand pounds shall be deemed the capital for the purposes of the wet dock authorized by this Order, and twenty thousand pounds shall be deemed the capital for the purposes of the other works authorized by this Order. But nothing in the present provision shall be taken to affect the dividends to be from time to time made by the Company.

5. No call shall exceed two pounds ten shillings per share, or be made payable within three months of any previous call.

6. For the purposes of the wet dock, the Company may, with the sanction of a General Meeting of the Company specially convened, borrow on mortgage or bond, at interest, from time to time, for periods not exceeding ten years, such sums of money, not exceeding in the whole the sum of twenty thousand pounds, as may from time to time be required; but no money shall be so borrowed until the whole of the capital sum of forty thousand pounds is subscribed for or taken, and until one-half thereof is paid up, and until the Company proves to the Justice who is to certify under The Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, section 40, before he so certifies, that all such capital has been subscribed for ban& fide, and is held by subscribers or their assigns legally liable for the same.

7. For the purposes of the works other than the wet dock, the Company may, with the sanotion of a General Meeting of the Company specially convened, borrow on mortgage or bond, at interest, from time to time, for periods not exceeding ten years, such sums of money, not exceeding in the whole the sum of ten thousand pounds, as may from time

Provisional Order of the Board of Trade for the Purchase, Maintenance, and Regulation of the Chatham Sun Pier at Chatham, in the County of Kent.

Whereas under The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, and The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, Amendment Act, application was made by or on behalf of the promoters of the undertaking herein-after mentioned by a memorial to the Lords of the Committee of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, appointed for the consideration of matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations, herein-after called the Board of Trade, representing that the pier called the Chatham Sun Pier was then a private pier, over which there were no public rights, but that the use thereof by the public was permissive only upon payment of certain rates of charge, variable at discretion by the owner of such pier for the time being; that it would be of public advantage if such pier were vested in a duly constituted public body, and were made a public pier, subject to legal rates of charge, and to such restrictions and regulations as the situation and mode of construction of such pier might render expedient; and that the same could be then purchased by or on behalf of the Local Board of Health for the district of Chatham Extra, in the county of Kent, on reasonable terms; and application was thereby made to the Board of Trade, among other things, to make a Provisional Order, and thereby to empower the Local Board of Health to purchase by voluntary contract, and to hold to them and their successors as a Corporation, and to maintain, the pier, with the entrance and right of approach, and other accommodations or interests in or in connexion with it; and also to empower the Local Board of Health and their successors to levy rates and to raise money by mortgage of the pier and rates, or otherwise, with such other provisions in connexion with or for the promotion of the objects of that application as the Board of Trade might deem expedient:

And whereas the estimated expenditure for the purposes by the said memorial proposed to be effected is Two thousand pounds and no more:

And whereas the Harbour rates, customs, and dues, as defined by the said schedule, are insufficient for the payment of the interest on the said mortgages, and for the maintenance and repair of the said Harbour:

And whereas, under The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, and The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, Amendment Act, the Nairn Harbour Board made application by a memorial to the Lords of the Committee of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council appointed for the consideration of matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations, herein-after called The Board of Trade, praying for (among other things) a Provisional Order under the said Acts for power to levy and recover rates according to the Schedule in the memorial referred to, and for the extinction of the said exemptions:

And whereas the Nairn Harbour Board published the advertisements and deposited the documents which, by the last-mentioned Act, they were required to publish and deposit:

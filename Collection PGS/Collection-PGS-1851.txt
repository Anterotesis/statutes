An Act to continue certain of the Allowances of the Duty of Excise on Soap used in Manufactures.

[1st August 1851.]

4 A IN WHEREAS by an Act passed in the Third Year of the 3 & 4 W. 4. C. 16. Reign of King William the Fourth, Chapter Sixteen,

certain Allowances of the Duties of Excise paid on Soap were granted in respect of Soap used in certain Manufactures and Processes set forth in the said Act, and which Allowances were to cease at the End of the Session of Parliament next after the Thirty-first Day of May One thousand eight hundred and thirty-five: And whereas by subsequent Acts, and particularly by an Act passed in the Thirteenth Year of the 12 & 13 Vict Reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Chapter Forty, the c, 4a 4 said Allowances (except the Allowance for the whitening of new Linen in the Piece for Sale) were continued until the End of the Session of Parliament next after the Thirty-first Day of July One thousand eight hundred and fifty: And whereas it is expedient that the said Allowances (except as aforesaid) should be further continued Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same,

I. That the said Allowances (except the Allowance of the Certain Allow-Duty on Soap used, employed, or consumed in the whitening of P?04* new Linen in the Piece for Sale) shall continue and remain P

payable until the End of the Session of Parliament next after the Thirty-first Day of July One thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, in like Manner as if the same had been made payable until that Time by the said first-recited Act.

[1st August 1851.]

WHEREAS divers of Her Majesty's Roman Catholic Subjects have assumed to themselves the Titles of Archbishop and Bishops of a pretended Province, and of pretended Sees or Dioceses, within the United Kingdom, under colour of an alleged Authority given to them for that Purpose by certain Briefs, Rescripts, or Letters Apostolical from the See 4 of Rome, and particularly by a certain Brief, Rescript, or Letters Apostolical purporting to have been given at Rome on

the Twenty-ninth of September One thousand eight hundred and fifty: And whereas by the Act of the Tenth Year of King George the Fourth, Chapter Seven, after reciting that the

Protestant Episcopal Church of England and Ireland^ and the Doctrine, Discipline, and Government thereof, and likewise the Protestant Presbyterian Church of Scotland, and the Doc-

trine, Discipline, and Government thereof, were by the reapec- tive Acts of Union of England and Scotland, and of Great Britain and Ireland, established permanently and inviolably, and that the Right and Title of Archbishops to their respective Provinces, of Bishops to their Sees, and of Deans to their Deaneries, as well in England as in Ireland, had been settled and established by Law, it was enacted, that if any Person

after the Commencement of that Act, other than the Person thereunto authorized by Law, should assume or use the Name,

Style, or Title of Archbishop of any Province, Bishop of any Bishopric, or Dean of any Deanery, in England or Ireland, he

should for every such Offence forfeit and pay the Sum of One hundred Pounds: And whereas it may be doubted whether the recited Enactment extends to the Assumption of the Title of Archbishop or Bishop of a pretended Province or Diocese, 4 or Archbishop or Bishop of a City, Place, or Territory, or

Dean of any pretended Deanery in England or Ireland, not

being the See, Province, or Diocese of any Archbishop or Bishop or Deanery of any Dean recognized by Law; but the Attempt to establish, under colour of Authority from die See 4 of Rome or otherwise, such pretended Sees, Provinces, Dio-

ceses, or Deaneries, is illegal and void: And whereas it is expedient to prohibit the Assumption of such Titles in respect of any Places within the United Kingdom:' Be it therefore declared and enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That —

The Founder, Meers, and the Barmaster shall enter the Particulars of the Gift in his Book; and if the Lessee for the Time being of the Duties of Lot and Cope, and if there shall be no such Lessee, then if Her Majesty or Her Successors, neglect or refuse duly and reasonably to work the Meer so set out to such Lessee or Her Majesty or Her Successors as aforesaid, the Finder shall have the Right to purchase the said Meer at such Price as the Steward and Grand Jury may fix and determine, or the Finder may continue and maintain his Workings through the said Meer, upon laying aside for the Use of the Lessee or Her Majesty, as the Case may be, all the Ore that may be gotten therein, after deducting the Expenses of getting the same.

11. The Barmaster shall not set out any Ground under the Tenth Article until Ore shall have been raised from the Mine for which such Ground shall be required, nor until there shall have been paid to the Lessee for the Time being of the Duties of Lot and Cope, or if there shall be no such Lessee, to Her Majesty and Her Successors, the first customary Payment due to him, her, or them, such first customary Payment being so much Ore as shall be sufficient to fill the Dish or Measure mentioned in the Third Article, and being called the Freeing Dish; and the Miner shall pay to the Lessee for the Time being of the said Duties, and if there be no such Lessee, to Her Majesty and Her Successors, a similar Dish of Ore for every third and subsequent Meer which he shall reach of the Vein in which he is working.

13. If any Vein shall cross another Vein, the Miner who comes to the Pee or Intersection first shall have such Pee or Intersection, and may work therein as far as he can reach with a Pick or Hack, such Pick or Hack having a Helve or Shaft Three Quarters of a Yard long, so that he stands wholly within the Cheeks of his own Vein when he works such Pee or Intersection.

14. When Two Veins approach each other but are parted with a Hither, and such Veins continue asunder for One Meer or further in Length without any Joint of Ore or other Mineral crossing the same (such Joint of Ore or other Mineral not being a new Vein), and the Hither during that Distance in all Parts exceeds Three Feet in Thickness, then they are to be considered and treated as Two distinct Veins so long as they so continue asunder, but whenever they again meet the elder or prior Title shall take the Vein.

15. In any Dispute where the Priority of Title shall come in question the longest continued Ownership shall prevail, but all Gifts from the Barmaster shall be considered as the Origin and Commencement of the Title, and Workmanship prior to such Gift (if any) shall not avail; and in all Cases the Jury on the Trial shall decide the Fact of such Priority.

16. If any Person shall claim Title to any Mine, the Claimant may commence an Action in the Small Barmote Court, by causing a Plaint to be entered in the Book mentioned in the Fifth Section; and if any Miner shall commit a Trespass in the Mine or Vein of any other Person, the Person aggrieved may commence an Action in the Small Barmote Court, by causing a Plaint to be entered in an Action of Trespass, and may proceed to Trial in the Small Barmote Court, and shall there recover Possession of the said Mine in the Action of Title, or Damages to be assessed by the Jury for the said Trespass; and any Person claiming a Debt against a Miner for Articles furnished to a Mine, or for Mining Purposes, or for Work or Labour in, upon, or in respect of any Mineral Property, may cause a Plaint to be entered in an Action of Debt, and shall annex the Particulars of his Debt to the Summons, and proceed to Trial in the Small Barmote Court, and shall there recover such Amount, if any, as upon Proof shall appear to be due to

17. No Miner or other Person shall, except as herein-after mentioned, bring more than One Action of Title to recover the same Mine, and a Nonsuit shall be deemed of the same Effect as a Judgment for the Defendant; but in Actions of Trespass or Debt the Plaintiff, if non-suited, shall be allowed to commence a fresh Action: Provided always, that the Steward shall in any Case whatever, whether of Title, Trespass, or Debt, have the Power, if he shall think fit, to order a new Trial to be had, upon such Terms as he shall think reasonable, and in the meantime to stay the Proceedings.

18. Every Meer of Ground shall contain Thirty-two Yards in Length; and the Miner shall be entitled to take and have set out for him any Proportion of a Meer, upon freeing the same, by Payment of an Amount of Ore proportionate to the Amount payable upon freeing a whole Meer.

20. If any Person has Shares in a Mine, and refuses to join his Partners or the Owners of the other Shares in working the same, or to pay his Proportion of the Expenses of working the same for the Space of Six Days after the same has been demanded by the Party complaining or his Agent, he shall forfeit his Part and Share to his Partners, who shall be entitled to recover the same against such defaulting Owner in an Action of Title in the Small Barmote Court, and the only Evidence necessary in such Action to enable the Plaintiff to obtain Judgment shall be Proof that the Plaintiff has worked the said Mine,

22. If the Barmaster shall, in any Matter connected with the Duties of his Office, require a View to be made by the Grand Jury, or if the Plaintiff or Defendant in any Action of Title or Trespass in the Small Barmote Court, or if any Miner or other Person shall for any Purpose require a View to be made of the Mine or Works of any Person whomsoever, then and in each and every of such Cases a View shall be made, and the Person so requiring a View shall, when the Grand Jury are assembled, deliver to the Steward a Bill of Directions describing the Mine or particular Part or Parts of a Mine, or Ground or Works, or other Matters or Things, which the Grand Jury are required to view, and stating the Question upon which their Opinion is required, but such Bill of Directions shall contain no Argument or Comment whatever, and thereupon the Steward shall openly read the said Bill of Directions to the Grand Jury, and, if the Same is in the Opinion of the Steward properly framed, deliver it to One of the Grand Jury, who shall take the same with him for the Guidance of himself and the rest of the Grand Jury in making their View; but if any Person affected by the said Proceeding object to the said Bill of Directions or to any Cross Bill delivered as herein-after mentioned as containing Matter of Argument, Assertion, or Comment not being a Description of the Mine, Ground, or Works, or other Matters or Things to be viewed, or a Statement of the Question necessary for the Guidance of the Grand Jury in making their View, the Steward before delivering the Bill or Cross Bill to the Grand Jury shall in all Cases decide upon the Validity of such Objections, and if he thinks the same well founded shall cause the Bill or Cross Bill to be altered and corrected in such Manner as the Steward shall think right, and after making such View such of the Grand Jury as shall concur in Opinion shall in answer to such Bill and Cross Bill, if any, write their Opinion and sign it, and such of the Grand Jury as shall not concur in Opinion with any

solidated Titles respectively shall be considered as the working of the whole thereof, and so long as any Part thereof be so worked the same shall not be liable to be operated upon by the Barmaster in pursuance of the Nineteenth Article.

28. If the Grand Jury shall be summoned to any View by any Person, not being Plaintiff or Defendant in any Action in the Small Barmote Court, for the Purpose of delivering their Opinion as to whether any other Person is working in any Mineral Ground belonging to the Persons so summoning the Grand Jury, and the Majority of the Grand Jury assembled at any such View, and give it as their Opinion that such is in all probability the Case, but that for Wnnt of Workmanship the Fact does not yet clearly appear, it shall be lawful for the Steward to require such other Person to give to the Steward Security for the Value of all Ore which may be gotten in his Workings thenceforth, until such Time as sufficient Working shall have been done to make the Truth appear; and unless Security shall be given unto and to the Satisfaction of the Steward, it shall be lawful for him to direct and authorize the Barmaster to retain all Ore gotten in the Workings of such other Person so failing to give Security, until such Security shall be given, or until sufficient further Working shall have been done to enable the Grand Jury at any adjourned View to form a satisfactory Opinion; and if the Grand Jury assembled at any such adjourned View, or the Majority of those so assembled, shall state their Opinion to be that the Workings of the Person originally summoning the Grand Jury1 and of such other Person form One and the same Title, the Steward shall thereupon order the Barmaster to deliver to the Person who shall have originally summoned the Grand Jury the Ore which shall have been so retained as aforesaid, or, if Security shall have been given as aforesaid, then the Person who shall have originally summoned the Grand Jury shall be entitled to the Benefit of such Security, to the Extent of the Value of the Ore which shall have been gotten by such other Person as aforesaid since the original View, and shall be entitled to use the Name of the Steward, if necessary, for enforcing such Security, and if either Party feels himself aggrieved, such Party may prosecute his Claim in the Small Barmote Court.

An Act for further improving the Administration of Criminal Justice.

[7th August 1851.]

WHEREAS Offenders frequently escape Conviction on

their Trials by reason of the technical Strictness of Cri-

minal Proceedings in Matters not material to the Merits of the Case: And whereas such technical Strictness may safely

be relaxed in many Instances, so as to ensure the Punishment of the Guilty, without depriving the Accused of any just Means of Defence: And whereas a Failure of Justice often takes

place on the Trial of Persons charged with Felony and Mis-f demeanor by reason of Variances between the Statement in the

Indictment on which the Trial is had and the Proof of Names,

4 Dates, Matters, and Circumstances therein mentioned, not material to the Merits of the Case, and by the Mis statement whereof the Person on Trial cannot have been prejudiced in his

Defence Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

I. From and after the coming of this Act into operation, whenever on the Trial of any Indictment for any Felony or Misdemeanor there shall appear to be any Variance between the Statement in such Indictment and the Evidence offered in Proof thereof, in thq Name of any County, Riding, Division, City, Borough, Town Corporate, Parish, Township, or Place mentioned or described in any such Indictment, or in the Name or Description of any Person or Persons, or Body Politic or Corporate, therein stated or alleged to be the Owner or Owners of any Property, Real or Personal, which shall form the Subject of any Offence charged therein, or in the Name or Description of any Person or Persons, Body Politic or Corporate, therein

II. Every Verdict and Judgment which shall be given after the making of any Amendment under the Provisions of this Act shall be of the same Force and Effect in all respects as if the Indictment had originally been in the same Form in which it was after such Amendment was made.

If it shall become necessary at any Time for any Purpose whatsoever to draw up a formal Record in any Case where any Amendment shall have been made under the Provisions of this Act, such Record shall be drawn up in the Form in which the Indictment was after such Amendment was made, without taking any Notice of the Fact of such Amendment having been made.

IV. In any Indictment for Murder or Manslaughter preferred after the coming of this Act into operation it shall not be necessary to set forth the Manner in which or the Means by which the Death of the Deceased was caused, but it shall be sufficient in every Indictment for Murder to charge that the Defendant did feloniously, wilfully, and of his Malice aforethought kill and murder the Deceased, and it shall be sufficient in every Indictment for Manslaughter to charge that the Defendant did feloniously kill and slay the Deceased.

V. In any Indictment for forging, uttering, stealing, embezzling, destroying, or concealing, or for obtaining by false Pretences, any Instrument, it shall be sufficient to describe such Instrument by any Name or Designation by which the same may be usually known, or by the Purport thereof, without setting out any Copy or Facsimile thereof, or otherwise describing the same or the Value thereof.

VII. In all other Cases wherever it shall be necessary to make any Averment in any Indictment as to any Instrument, whether the same consists wholly or in part of Writing, Print, or Figures, it shall be sufficient to describe such Instrument by any Name or Designation by which the same may be usually known, or by the Purport thereof, without setting out any Copy or Fac-simile of the whole or any Part thereof.

VIII. From and after the coming of this Act into operation it shall be sufficient in any Indictment for forging, uttering, offering, disposing of, or putting off any Instrument whatsoever, or for obtaining or attempting to obtain any Property by false Pretences, to allege that the Defendant did the Act with Intent to defraud, without alleging the Intent of the Defendant to be to defraud any particular Person; and on the Trial of any of the Offences in this Section jnentioned it shall not be necessary to prove an Intent on the Part of the Defendant to defraud any

IX. And whereas Offenders often escape Conviction by i reason that such Persons ought to have been charged with attempting to commit Offences, and not with the actual Gom- mission thereof:' For Remedy thereof be it enacted, That if on the Trial of any Person charged with any Felony or Misdemeanor it shall appear to the Jury upon the Evidence that the Defendant did not complete the Offence charged, but that he was guilty only of an Attempt to commit the same, such Person shall not by reason thereof be entitled to be acquitted, but the Jury shall be at liberty to return as their Verdict that the Defendant is not guilty of the Felony or Misdemeanor charged, but is guilty of an Attempt to commit the same, and thereupon such Person shall be liable to be punished in the same Manner as if he had been convicted upon an Indictment for attempting to commit the particular Felony or Misdemeanor charged in the said Indictment; and no Person so tried as herein lastly mentioned shall be liable to be afterwards prosecuted for an Attempt to commit the Felony or Misdemeanor for which he was so tried.

X. And whereas it is enacted by a certain Act of Parliament i passed in the First Year of the Reign of Her present Majesty i Queen Victoria^ intituled An Act to amend the Laws relating ' to Offences against the Person, that " on the Trial of any w Person for any of the Offences therein-before mentioned, or " for any Felony whatever where the Crime charged shall 6 " include an Assault against the Person, it shall be lawful for c " the Jury to acquit of the Felony, and to find a Verdict of guilty of Assault against the Person indicted, if the Evi- Ci dence shall warrant such Finding: " And whereas great ' Difficulties have arisen in the Construction of such Enactment For Remedy thereof be it enacted, That the said Enactment shall be and the same is hereby repealed.

XI. If upon the Trial of any Person upon any Indictment for Robbery it shall appear to the Jury upon the Evidence that the Defendant did not commit the Crime of Robbery, but that he did commit an Assault with Intent to rob, the Defendant shall not by reason thereof be entitled to be acquitted, but the Jury shall be at liberty to return as their Verdict that the Defendant is guilty of an Assault with Intent to rob, and thereupon such Defendant shall be liable to be punished in the same Manner as if he had been convicted upon an Indictment for feloniously assaulting with Intent to rob; and no Person so tried as is herein lastly mentioned shall be liable to be afterwards prosecuted for an Assault with Intent to commit the Robbery for which he was so tried.

XII. If upon the Trial of any Person for any Misdemeanor it shall appear that the Facts given in Evidence amount in Law to a Felony, such Person shall not by reason thereof be entitled

to

1851. Administration of Criminal Justice Improvement. Cap. 100.

to be acquitted of such Misdemeanor; and no Person tried for the Offence such Misdemeanor shall be liable to be afterwards prosecuted for ^don^unlm Felony on the same Facts, unless the Court before which such the°Cou*t »T* Trial may be had shall think fit, in its Discretion, to discharge direct, the Jury from giving any Verdict upon such Trial, and to direct such Person to be indicted for Felony, in which Case such Person may be dealt with in all respects as if he had not been put upon his Trial for such Misdemeanor.

XIII. If upon the Trial of any Person indicted for Embezzle- Person indicted

ment as a Clerk, Servant, or Person employed for the Purpose mentasa^a«rk or in the Capacity of a Clerk or Servant, it shall be proved that &£nnot u> be he took the Property in question in any such Manner as to acquitted if the amount in Law to Larceny, he shall not by reason thereof be.

entitled to be acquitted, but the Jury shall be at liberty to and rioe return as their Verdict that such Person is not guilty of Em- veni! bezzlement, but is guilty of Simple Larceny, or of Larceny as

a Clerk, Servant, or Person employed for the Purpose or in the Capacity of a Clerk or Servant, as the Case may be, and thereupon such Person shall be liable to be punished in the same Manner as if he had been convicted upon an Indictment for such Larceny; and if upon the Trial of any Person indicted for Larceny it shall be proved that he took the Property in question in any such Manner as to amount in Law to Embezzlement, he shall not by reason thereof be entitled to be acquitted, but the Jury shall be at liberty to return as their Verdict that such Person is not guilty of Larceny, but is guilty of Embezzlement, and thereupon such Person shall be liable to be punished in the same Manner as if he had been convicted upon an Indictment for such Embezzlement; and no Person so tried for Embezzlement or Larceny as aforesaid shall be liable to be afterwards prosecuted for Larceny or Embezzlement upon the same Facts.

XIV. If upon the Trial of Two or more Persons indicted On an Iodict-for jointly receiving any Property it shall be proved that One

or more of such Persons separately received any Part of such sons may be Property, it shall be lawful for the Jury to convict upon such convicted of se-Indictment such of the said Persons as shall be proved to have ^*tel7 recelT' received any Part of such Property.

XV. And whereas it frequently happens that the Principal Separate A©.

in a Felony is not in Custody or amenable to Justice, although JSSersniy

in Custody or amenable to Justice:' For the Prevention of ^tencetfthe several Trials be it enacted, That any Number of such Access principal Felon, saries or Receivers may be charged with substantive Felonies in the same Indictment, notwithstanding the principal Felon shall not be included in the same Indictment, or shall not be in Custody or amenable to Justice.

raised that they should be allowed to receive any Half Pay to which they might be entitled, notwithstanding their holding Subaltern Commissions in the said Corps, but no Provision

An Act for appointing Commissioners to inquire into the Existence of Bribery in the Borough of St. Alban.

[8th August 1851.]

WHEREAS there is Reason to believe that the Practice of Bribery at Elections of Members to serve in Parliament for the Borough of St. Alban's hath long prevailed in

the said Borough, and that Bribery to a great Extent hath been ' systematically committed there at the last Election of a Member of Parliament: And whereas an Election Committee was (appointed to consider the Merits of a Petition presented to (the House of Commons, wherein the System of Bribery so believed to be practised was (amongst other things) alleged and ' set forth: And whereas by reason of the Contrivance of certain Parties more or less implicated in the same certain Persons who had been summoned or intended to be summoned as Witnesses in support of such Allegations of Bribery were induced (to abscond and withdraw themselves from Obedience to such ' Summons, by reason whereof the full and effectual Inquiry into ' the Allegations of the Petition aforesaid was prevented, and (the Purposes for which such Committee was appointed were ' obstructed and defeated; And whereas it would tend to ensure a full Discovery of the said Bribery if an Inquiry should be 6 made on the Spot by Commissioners to be specially appointed

for that Purpose, and fully authorized to inquire into the

Allegations aforesaid, and into the Existence and Extent of

Bribery in the said Borough, and the Mode in which the same 6 hath been practised and carried on Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons,

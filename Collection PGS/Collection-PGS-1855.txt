[14th August 1855.]

WHEREAS by the Custom of Merchants a Bill of Lading of Goods being transferable by Endorsement the Property in the Goods may thereby pass to the Endorsee, but nevertheless all Rights in respect of the Contract contained in the Bill of Lading continue in the original Shipper or Owner, and it is expedient that such Rights should pass with the Property: And whereas it frequently happens that the Goods in respect of which Bills of Lading purport to be signed have not been laden on board, and it is proper that such Bills of Lading in the Hands of a bona fide Holder for Value should not be questioned by the Master or other Person signing the same on the Ground of the Goods not having been ' laden as aforesaid: ' Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

II. Nothing herein contained shall prejudice or affect any Right of Stoppage in transitu, or any Right to claim Freight against the original Shipper or Owner, or any Liability of the Consignee or Endorsee by reason or in consequence of his being such Consignee or Endorsee, or of his Receipt of the Goods by reason or in consequence of such Consignment or Endorsement.

III. Every Bill of Lading in the Hands of a Consignee or Endorsee for valuable Consideration representing Goods to have been shipped on board a Vessel shall be conclusive Evidence of such Shipment as against the Master or other Person signing the same, notwithstanding that such Goods or some Part thereof may not have been so shipped, unless such Holder of the Bill of Lading shall have had actual Notice at the Time of receiving the same that the Goods had not been in fact laden on board: Provided, that the Master or other Person so signing may exonerate himself in respect of such Misrepresentation by showing that it was caused without any Default on his Part, and wholly by the Fraud of the Shipper, or of the Holder, or some Person under whom the Holder claims.

Whereas, upon the petition of not les3 than one tenth of the inhabitants rated to the relief of the Poor of and within the Borough of Middlesbrough, in the North Riding of the County of York, and within the boundaries of the said borough, as fixed for the purposes of an Act passed in the sixth year of the reign of King William the Fourth, intituled " An Act to provide for the regulation of Municipal Corporations in England and Wales," We, the General Board of Health, appointed for the Purposes of the Public Health Act, 1848, have, in pursuance of the provisions of that Act, directed William Ranger, a Superintending Inspector, appointed for the purposes of the said Act, to visit the said Borough, within and throughout the said boundaries, and to make public inquiry, and to examine witnesses as to the sewerage, drainage, and supply of water, the state of the burial grounds, the number and sanitary condition of the inhabitants, and as to any Local Acts of Parliament in force within the said Borough, for paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, regulating, supplying with water, or improving the said Borough, or having relation to the purposes of the said Act; also as to the natural drainage areas, and the existing municipal, parochial, or other local boundaries, and the boundaries which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, having previously given the notices directed by the said Act, proceeded upon the said inquiry, and hath reported in writing to the said General Board upon the several Matters with respect to which he was directed to inquire, and upon certain other matters in respect of which he deemed it expedient to report for the Purposes of that Act

And whereas Copies of the said Report, accompanied by a notice, stating that written statements might be forwarded to the said Board with respect to any matter contained in or omitted from the said Report, or any amendment proposed to be made therein, have been duly published and deposited as directed by the said Public Health Act, and the time for forwarding such statements has now elapsed, and all such statements as have been received by the said Board have been duly deposited as required by that Act

And whereas it appears upon such Report that there is a certain Local Act of Parliament in force within the said Borough, having relation to the purposes of the said Public Health Act; (that is to say,) An Act passed in the fourth and fifth years of the reign of Queen Victoria, intituled " An Act for paving, lighting, watching, cleansing, and otherwise " improving the Town of Middlesbrough, and the neighbourhood thereof, in the North Riding " of the County of York, and for establishing a market therein."

And whereas jt appears to the said General Board of Health to be expedient that the said Public Health Act, except as herein-after mentioned, should be applied to the said Borough;

and

Provisional Order for the Application of the Public Health Act to the Township of Tunstall,

in the County of Stafford.

General Board of Health.

Whereas upon the petition of not less than one tenth of the inhabitants rated to the relief of the poor of and within the Township of Tunstall, in the County of Stafford, We, the General Board of Health, appointed for the purposes of the Public Health Act, 1848, have, in pursuance of the provisions of that Act, directed William Ranger, a Superintending Inspector, appointed for the purposes of the said Act, to visit the said Township, within and throughout the said boundaries, and to make public inquiry, and to examine witnesses as to the sewerage, drainage, and supply of water, the state of the burial grounds, the number and sanitary condition of the inhabitants, and as to any Local Acts of Parliament in force within the said Township for paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, regulating, supplying with water, or improving the said Township, or having relation to the purposes of the said Act; also, as to the natural drainage areas, and the existing municipal, parochial, or other local boundaries, and the boundaries which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, having previously given the notices directed by the said Act, proceeded upon the said inquiry, and hath reported in writing to the said General Board upon the several matters with respect to which he was directed to inquire, and upon certain other matters in respect of which he deemed it expedient to report for the purposes of that Act.

And whereas copies of the said Report, accompanied by a notice stating that written statements might be forwarded to the said Board with respect to any matter contained in or omitted from the said Report, or any amendment proposed to be made therein, have been duly published and deposited as directed by the said Public Health Act, and the time for forwarding such statements has now elapsed, and all such statements as have been received by the said Board have been duly deposited as required by that Act.

And whereas it appears upon such Report that there is a certain Local Act of Parliament in force within the said Township having relation to the purposes of the said Public Health Act; that is to say, an Act passed in the tenth and eleventh years of the reign of Queen Victoria, intituled " An Act for paving, lighting, watching, cleaning, and otherwise improving " the Town and neighbourhood of Tunstall, in the County of Stafford, and for improving and " regulating the market place and markets therein/ '

And whereas it appears to the said General Board of Health to be expedient that the said Public Health Act should be applied to the said Township, and that provision should be made with respect to the said Local Act of Parliament, and the partial repeal, alteration, extension, and further execution thereof, but the same cannot be done without the authority of Parliament.

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the power vested in the said Board by the Public Health Act, 1848, the said General Board of Health do, by this Provisional Order under my hand and seal of office, direct: —

II. Where the Justices before whom any Person is charged as aforesaid propose to dispose of the Case summarily under the foregoing Provisions, One of such Justices, after the Examinations of all the Witnesses for the Prosecution have been completed, and before calling upon the Person charged for any Statement which he may wish to make, shall state to such Person the Substance of the Charge against him, and shall then say to him these Words, or Words to the like Effect: " Do you consent that the Charge against you shall " be tried by us, or do you desire that it shall be sent for Trial by a Jury at the Sessions " or Assizes " (as the Case may be); and if the Person charged shall consent to the Charge bein<* summarily tried and determined as aforesaid, then the Justices shall reduce the Charge into Writing, and read the same to such Person, and shall then ask him whether he is guilty or not of such Charge; and if such Person shall say that he is guilty, the Justices shall then proceed to pass such Sentence upon him as may by Law be passed, subject to the Provisions of this Act in respect to such Offence; but if the Person charged shall say that he is not guilty, the Justices shall then inquire of such Person whether he has any Defence to make to such Charge, and if he shall state that he has a Defence the Justices shall hear such Defence, and then proceed to dispose of the Case summarily.

III. Where any Person is charged before any Justices at such Petty Sessions as aforesaid with Simple Larceny (the Property alleged to have been stolen exceeding in Value Five Shillings), or stealing from the Person, or Larceny as a Clerk or Servant, and the Evidence, when the Case on the Part of the Prosecution has been completed, is in the Opinion of such Justices sufficient to put the Person charged on his Trial for the Offence with which he is charged, such Justices, if the Case appear to them to be one which may properly be disposed of in a summary Way, and may be adequately punished by virtue of the Powers of this Act, shall reduce the Charge into Writing, and shall read it to the said

Person,

623

18° & 19° VICTORIA, c.126.

Person, and shall then ask him whether he is guilty or not of the Charge; and if such Person shall say that he is guilty such Justices shall thereupon cause a Plea of guilty to be entered upon the Proceedings, and shall convict him of such Offence, and commit him to the Common Gaol or House of Correction, there to be imprisoned, with or without Hard Labour, for any Term not exceeding Six Calendar Months; and every such Conviction may be in the Form (C.) in the Schedule to this Act, or to the like Effect: Provided always, that the said Justices, before they ask such Person whether he is guilty or not, shall explain to him that he is not obliged to plead or answer before them at all, and that if he do not plead or answer before them he will be committed for Trial in the usual Course.

IV. In every Case of summary Proceeding under this Act the Person accused shall be allowed to mc^ce his full Answer and Defence, and to have all Witnesses examined and cross-examined by Counsel or Attorney.

V.

VI. If any Person suffered to go at large upon entering into such Recognizance as the Justice or Justices are authorized under the last-mentioned Act to take on the Remand of a Party accused do not afterwards appear pursuant to such Recognizance, then the Justices before whom he ought to have appeared shall certify (under the Hands of Two of them) on the Back of the Recognizance, to the Clerk of the Peace of the County or Place, the Fact of such Nonappearance, and such Recognizance shall be proceeded upon in like Manner as other Recognizances, and such Certificate shall be deemed sufficient prima facie Evidence of such Nonappearance.

VIL The Justices adjudicating under this Act shall transmit the Conviction, or a Duplicate of a Certificate of Dismissal, with the written Charge, the Depositions of the Witnesses for the Prosecution and for the Defence, and the Statement of the Accused^ to the next Court of General or Quarter Sessions for the County or Place, there to be kept by the proper Officer among the Records of the Court; and a Copy of such Conviction, or of such Certificate of Dismissal, certified by the proper Officer of the Court, or proved to be a true Copy, shall be sufficient Evidence to prove a Conviction or Dismissal lor the Offence mentioned therein in any legal Proceeding whatever.

Company, and are commonly designated East India Bonds: And whereas by an Act passed ' in the Session holden in the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Years of the Reign of Her ' present Majesty, Chapter One hundred and six, Section Sixty-seven, all Liabilities of the ' East India Company were transferred to the Secretary of State in Council: And whereas ' by an Act passed in the last Session of Parliament, Chapter Thirty-nine, Power was given

to the Secretary of State in Council to raise Money by Bonds or Debentures or the Creation of a Capital Stock or Annuities upon or for the Repayment of any Principal (Money secured under the Authority of the said Act or of either of the Acts therein recited: (And whereas it is expedient to extend such Power of raising Money to the Repayment of 6 any of the East India Bonds aforesaidBe it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows; (that is to say,)

L All Indian Government Promissory Notes, and Certificates issued or Stock created in lieu thereof, being Assets of a deceased Person, the Interest whereon or in respect of which shall be payable in London by Drafts payable in India, and which at the Decease of the Owner thereof shall have been registered in the Books of the Secretary of State in Council in London, or in the Books of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, or shall have been enfaced in India for the Purpose of being so registered before the Decease of the Owner thereof, and all Indian Government Promissory Notes issued with Coupons attached which, under such Regulations and Conditions as may be determined from Time to Time by the Secretary of State in Council, shall be so registered, and all Certificates issued or Stock created in lieu thereof, shall be deemed and taken to be Personal Estate and Bona notabilia of such deceased Person in England, and Probate or Letters of Administration in England, or Confirmation granted in Scotland, and sealed with the Seal of the Principal Court of Probate in England, in pursuance of the Provisions of the " Confirmation and Probate Act, 1858," shall be valid and sufficient to constitute the Persons therein named the legal Personal Representatives of the Deceased with respect to such Notes and Moneys as aforesaid.

L In any Case where the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury approve of any Mortgage of any Hereditaments of the Body Corporate of any Borough, the said Commissioners may, as a Condition of their Approval, require that the Money borrowed on the Security of such Mortgage shall be repaid, with all Interest thereon, in Thirty Years, or any less Period, and either by Instalments or by means of a Sinking Fund, or both, as the Baid Commissioners may think flt; and in every such Case the Sums required for providing for the Repayment of the Principal and Interest of the Money borrowed shall by virtue of this Act become charged upon the Hereditaments comprised in such Mortgage (without Prejudice to the Security thereby created) , or any other Hereditaments (if any) of the said Body Corporate, or the Borough Fund, or the Borough or other Rates legally applicable for the Payment or Discharge of the Money borrowed, or the Expenses which such Money may be borrowed to defray, or on all or any of the Securities aforesaid, as the said Commissioners may direct.

II. When any Money to be borrowed as aforesaid is directed to be repaid by means of a Sinking Fund, the Council of the Borough shall, out of the Rents and Profits of the Hereditaments, or out of the Borough Fund or Rates on which the Sums required for such Sinking Fund are charged under this Act, invest or cause to be invested such Sums, and at such Times and in such Government Annuities, as the said Commissioners may direct, and shall also from Time to Time invest or cause to be invested in like Manner all Dividends of such Annuities, so as to accumulate at Compound Interest, and all Annuities in which such Investments are made shall, in the Books of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England and of the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland respectively, be placed to the Account of the Body Corporate, and " In the Matter of the Municipal Corporation Mortgages, &c. Act, 1860," and the Dividends of such Annuities shall be paid to such Person or Persons as the said Council by Power of Attorney under the Corporate Seal of the Borough from Time to Time appoint, and shall be invested as herein directed; but the Annuities to be purchased shall not be sold or transferred without the Consent in Writing of the said Commissioners, addressed to the Chief Accountant of the Bank of England or of the Bank of Ireland (as the Case may require); and the Direction in Writing of the Council of the Borough by Power of Attorney under the Corporate Seal of the Borough, with such Consent in Writing of the said Commissioners, shall be sufficient Authority to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England or of the Bank of Ireland (as the Case may be) for permitting the Transfer of such Aiftiuities or any Part thereof.

III. Where any Purchase Money or Compensation has been paid into the Bank of England or Ireland, under any Act of Parliament, in respect of any Hereditaments, or any Interest therein, purchased or taken from any such Body Corporate, or in respect of any permanent Damage to any Land of any such Body Corporate, and the said Commissioners approve of the Payment of such Money or Compensation, or of any Money to arise from the Sale of any Government Securities in which the same may have been invested, to such Body Corporate or their Treasurer, the said Commissioners may, as a Condition of their Approval, require Provision to be made for raising in manner herein-before provided with respect to a Sinking Fund for Repayment of Money borrowed on Mortgage, and investing in Government Annuities a Sum equivalent to the Amount of Money so paid to such Body Corporate or their Treasurer; and the Provisions herein-before contained in the Case of a Sinking Fund, as to the Mode of investing, Payment of Dividends,

An Act to levy an Assessment in the County of Inverness to discharge a Debt on the Castle Stewart and Nairn Road in the said County.

[23d July 1860.]

WHEREAS the following Acts were passed for the Purpose of making and keeping in f repair certain Roads and Bridges in Scotland; that is to say, the Acts of the Forty- third of George the Third, Chapter Eighty, of the Fifty-ninth of George the Third,

Chapter One hundred and thirty-five, of the Fourth of George the Fourth, Chapter

Fifty-six, of the Fifth of George the Fourth, Chapter Thirty-eight, of the Third and ' Fourth of William the Fourth, Chapter Thirty-three, and of the Eleventh and Twelfth ' of Victoria, Chapter Forty: And whereas by the said Act of the Third and Fourth of c William the Fourth, Chapter Thirty-three, after reciting that it was expedient that Power ' should be granted to the Commissioners for Highland lToads and Bridges to fix and settle ' Plans for the Alteration and Improvement (amongst others) of the Line of Road from a f Point near Castle Stewart to the Western Extremity of the Nairnshire Turnpike Coast

Road, passing through the Parishes of Inverness, Petty, and Ardersier, in the County of

Inverness, it was enacted that as soon as sufficient Funds for defraying the Expense of ' making any such altered or new Line of Road should be provided to the Satisfaction ' of the said Commissioners in any of the Ways specified in the said Act, the said Com- missioners should be authorized and required to fix the precise Line or Direction of c any such Road; and from and after the Time when any such Alteration and Improvement should be completed the said Commissioners should be authorized and empowered ' to direct Tolls to be levied on such Road, and that such Road when so altered and

' improved should be maintained in repair by the said Commissioners: And whereas, ' the said Castle Stewart and Nairn Road was made by the said Commissioners under c the Provisions of the last-recited Act, and the Funds necessary for its Formation were i raised by borrowing Money on the Credit of the Tolls leviable on the said Road,

and a Portion of the Debt so contracted, amounting to Two thousand seven hundred (Pounds, still remains undischarged: And whereas, from the Formation of Railways and

other Causes, the Traffic on the said Road has much diminished, and the Revenue derived ' from the Tolls thereon is not more than sufficient to defray the Expense of maintaining

the said Road in repair, and affords no Surplus by means of which the Debt may be paid ' off, and it is therefore expedient that Provision should be made for the Payment of the

DebtBe it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

I. The Commissioners of Supply of the County of Inverness shall annually impose and levy an Assessment, for the Purpose of discharging the said Debt of Two thousand seven hundred Pounds, upon and from all Lands and Heritages within the County of Inverness, according to the yearly Rent or Value thereof, as established by the Valuation Rolls made up under the Valuation of Lands (Scotland) Acts, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Victoria, Chapter Ninety-one, and Twentieth and Twenty-first Victoria, Chapter Fifty-eight, or any other Act relating to the Valuation of Lands in Scotland, which may be in force for the Time being, and that at such Rate in every Year as shall be necessary in order to provide sufficient Funds for the Purposes of this Act, including such Sum as may be requisite to cover the Expenses of Assessment and Collection, and any Arrears of preceding Years; and such Assessments shall be imposed, levied, and recovered in the Manner provided by the recited Acts, or any of them, and under the Provisions thereof, which are hereby incorporated with this Act, and made applicable to the Assessments to be levied under this Act.

II. The said Commissioners of Supply shall impose and levy the said Assessment in such Manner and to such Amount as shall be sufficient to raise the Funds necessary for the Purposes of this Act, within a Time to be limited by the said Commissioners of Supply, not exceeding Thirty Years from the passing of this Act.

And whereas by the 24th Section of the said Waterworks Act it is enacted, that the said Local Board from time to time may, by agreement, purchase any lands which they might think requisite for any of the Purposes of the said Act, and on such terms and conditions as they may think fit, not exceeding five acres.

And whereas the said Local Board have proceeded to execute the works authorized by the said Waterworks Act, and the said District is now supplied with water by means thereof, but it has been found expedient and necessary for the better and more effectually affording and maintaining such supply of water that larger reservoirs should be constructed than were contemplated by the said Act; and the said Local Board are desirous of obtaining powers to purchase about twenty acres of land in addition to the five acfes of lands authorized to be purchased by the said Waterworks Act as aforesaid, and that the said Act should be otherwise altered as herein-after mentioned.

1. — The powers contained in the said 24th Section of the said Waterworks Act enabling

the said Local Board to purchase any lands by agreement as therein mentioned, not exceeding five acres, shall and may be used and exercised by the said Local Board for purchasing any quantity of land not exceeding twenty-five acres, in the same manner as if twenty-five acres had been originally mentioned in the said Waterworks Act instead of five acres; and the said Local Board may purchase such twenty-five acres of land, for the purpose of constructing, and may constrdot such reservoirs in any parish or parishes, place or places, as to the Baid Local Board shall seem expedient and necessary.

2. — The time within which it is enacted by the said 31st section of the said Waterworks

^ i}d whereas the provisions contained in the said Section of such Act, so far as the same are applicable to that portion of the non-corporate part of the aforesaid District of Banbury therein mentioned which is situated in the County of Oxford have been found to operate unfairly and oppressively as between the ratepayers of and in such portion who are now by law assessed at the full net annual value of their property, and the ratepayers of and in such portiop who are now by law assessed at one fourth of the full net annual value of their property within the District aforesaid; and whereas the said Local Board of Health have, in pursuance of the provisions of the 77th Section of the Local Government Act, 1858, presented a Petition to me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, praying that the provisions contained in the Provisional Order applying the Public Health Act, 1848, to the aforesaid District of Banbury, and in the First Public Health Supplemental Act , : 1852, may be partially repealed or altered, and such new provision made as would empower the said Local Board of Health for the time being to levy, throughout the non-corporate parts of such District situate in the County of Oxford, highway rates not exceeding in any one year the sum of one shilling in the pound, and enact that the land and other property in the last herein-before mentioned parts of such District which, by the Provisions of the Public Health Act, 1848, are assessable on one-fourth only of the annual value thereof, should not, in any year in which the same should be assessed to any highway rates or rates, be assessed to or liable to the paying of any other rates whatever to be made by the said Local Board.

4 INHERE AS a Debt was contracted by the City of Edinburgh to the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury for Advances made towards the Improvement of the

4 Harbour and Docks of Leith, and Bonds were granted by the Lord Provost, Magistrates,

4 and Council of the said City to the said Commissioners for further securing the said Debt,

4 which, after Deduction of the Payments made to account thereof, amounted in the Year

One thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight to Two hundred and twenty-eight thousand three hundred and seventy-four Pounds Nine Shillings and Eightpence: And whereas by

the Act First and Second Victoria, Chapter Fifty five, the Harbour and Docks of Leithy i & 2 Vict

and all the Property connected therewith and Revenues arising therefrom, were vested in 55«

the Commissioners appointed by the said Act for the Superintendence and Management

4 of the said Harbour and Docks, and the preferable Right and Security granted to and held by the said Commissioners of the Treasury were postponed to the annual Payment

of Seven thousand six hundred and eighty Pounds, therein provided for, and to, such annual Sums as should be approved of and allowed by the said Commissioners of the Treasury as the Establishment for the said Harbour and Docks, including Expenses of Management, Maintenance and Repairs, and the said Commissioners of the Treasury were

thereby

212 23° & 24° VICTORIA, c. 48:

4 thereby authorized to postpone further the Security held by them to any Loan to be ' effected by the Commissioners for the said Harbour and Docks for the Execution of ' Improvements and Repairs, not exceeding in all the Sum of One hundred and twenty-five ' thousand Pounds, and to forego for such Time as the said Commissioners of the Treasury

should think fit the Exaction, in whole or in part, of the Interest to become due upon the Amount of the Debt which should remain owing; and it was by the said Act provided, ' that the said Debt should be secured on the Revenues of the said Harbour and Docks, ' and Works and Property vested in the Commissioners for the said Harbour and Docks, and that no Claim or Demand should thereafter be competent to the said Commissioners of the Treasury for the Principal or Interest of the said Debt, or any Part thereof, from or against any of the other Property or Revenues of the City of Edinburgh, or the Lord

7 Vict c. 20. Provost, Magistrates, and Council thereof: And whereas by the Act Seventh Victoria

4 Chapter Twenty, the said Commissioners were incorporated by the Name of The Com44 missioners for the Harbour and Docks of Leith And whereas by the Act (Local and: io Vict c. xxv. ' Personal) Tenth Victoria, Chapter Twenty-five, the said Commissioners were authorized to levy the Rates and Duties specified in the Schedules annexed to the said Act on all Goods imported into or exported from the Harbour of Leith and Precincts thereof, and on all Vessels coming into or going out of the said Harbour and Precincts thereof, and for the Use of the Cranes and Weighing Machines, Rails, and Sheds at the said Harbour and Docks; and it was by the said Act provided that the said Commissioners should, in lieu of the Customs, Rates, Imposts, and Market Dues thereby abolished, pay annually, out of the Rates and Duties thereby authorized to be levied, to the Magistrates and Council of the Town of Leith the Sum of Five hundred Pounds at the Terms therein specified: And io & li Vict.

4 Docks of Leith at the Term of Whitsunday One thousand eight hundred and forty-seven,

including all Arrears of Interest due at that Term, should be taken at the said Sum of Two hundred and twenty-eight thousand three hundred and seventy-four Pounds Nine Shillings and Eightpence, and the said Commissioners of the Treasury were thereby empowered to allow the Commissioners for the said Harbour and Docks to appropriate the whole Monies then in their Hands, or which might thereafter accrue to them from the surplus Revenue of the said Harbour and Docks, or such Part thereof as the said Commissioners of the Treasury from Time to Time should think fit to allow for that Purpose 4 (after Payment of the said annual Sum of Seven thousand six hundred and eighty

Pounds, and the Expense of the Establishment, and any extraordinary Expense which might be necessary in the event of any unforeseen Damage arising to the Works of the said Harbour and Docks through Storm or Accident) , towards the Expense of carrying into execution the Plan for the Improvement of the said Harbour and Docks referred to in the said Act, with such Alterations, Additions, or Omissions as should be from Time to Time sanctioned by the said Commissioners of the Treasury: And whereas the Commissioners for the said Harbour and Docks have executed various Works and Improvements at the said Harbour and Docks since the passing of the first-recited Act, and have defrayed the Expense thereof out of the surplus Revenues accruing from Time to Time, and out ' of Money borrowed by them under the Authority of the first-recited Act, with the Sanction of the said Commissioners of the Treasury from the Bank of Scotland, the Royal Bank of Scotland, the British Linen Company Bank, the Commercial Bank of Scotland,

the National Bank of Scotland, and the Union Bank of Scotland, of which Money so borrowed the Sum of Forty-three thousand three hundred and sixty Pounds Eighteen Shillings and Fivepence still remains owing; and the said Commissioners of the Treasury have also sanctioned the Expenditure of the further Sum of Forty thousand Pounds on the Construction of a Graving Dock and other Works and Improvements for which Contracts have been entered into; and which Sums borrowed and to be borrowed are, under the Provisions of the first-recited Act, preferable to the said Debt of Two hundred and twenty-eight thousand three hundred and seventy-four Pounds Nine Shillings and Eightpence, which still remains owing to the said Commissioners of the Treasury: And whereas the surplus Revenues of the said Harbour and Docks, after paying the said annual Sum of Seven thousand six hundred and eighty Pounds, and the ordinary Expenditure on

4 Management,

' Management, Maintenance, Repairs, and Dredging, the Interest on the Sums borrowed ' under the Authority of the first-recited Act, and the said annual Sum of Five hundred

Pounds payable to the Magistrates and Council of Leith, and providing for the Execution

of Works and Improvements essentially necessary for the Accommodation of the Trade 1 and Shipping, are insufficient to pay off the said Debt of Two hundred and twenty-eight ' thousand three hundred and seventy-four Pounds Nine Shillings and Eightpence: And

whereas the Commissioners for the said Harbour and Docks have offered to pay to the

said Commissioners of the Treasury the Sum of Fifty thousand Pounds, in full Satisfaction ' of the said Debt and Interest, and of all their Claims against the said Harbour and Docks;

SHEERNESS.

Provisional Order for altering the Boundaries of the District of Minster in the County of Kent, as constituted for the Purposes of the Public Health Act, 1848.

Local Government Act, 1858.

Whereas by a Provisional Order of the General Board of Health, bearing date the Sixteenth day of July 1849, confirmed by the Public Health Supplemental Act, 1849, the Public Health Act, 1848, was duly applied to the Parish of Minster in the County of Kent.

And whereas a Petition has been duly presented to me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, under the Provisions of the 77th Section of the Local Government Act, 1858, praying for an alteration of the boundaries of the said District of Minster, by the separation of the Village and part of the upper District of Minster aforesaid from the District constituted under the herein-before recited Provisional Order, and the Act confirming the same.

And whereas, in pursuance of the said Local Government Act, inquiry has been directed in the said District in respect of the several matters mentioned in the said Petition, and report has been made to me thereon by Alfred Dickens, Esquire, the Inspector appointed for the purpose.

And whereas it appears expedient to issue a Provisional Order in relation to the said matters, but no such Order can be valid without confirmation by Parliament.

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the powers vested in me by the said Local Government Act, I, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do, by this Provisional Order, under my hand, direct, —

That, from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this Order —

1. — The District of the aforesaid Local Board of Health for Minster, in the County of

Kent, be altered by so much of the Upper Division of Minster aforesaid as is situate on the east side of the Boundary of the Ecclesiastical District of Sheerness being excluded from the District of the aforesaid Local Board of Health.

2. — The District altered as aforesaid be styled the District of Sheerness, instead of being,

as heretofore, styled the District of the Parish of Minster.

3. — At every election of members of the Local Board of Health aforesaid which shall

take place after the passing of the Act of Parliament confirming this Order, the members to be elected shall be elected for the whole of the District as altered by this Order, and by the votes of owners of, and ratepayers in respect of, property situate within the district so constituted.

Given under my hand this Twenty-fifth day of June 1860.

Whereas, by a Provisional Order of the General Board of Health, bearing date the Twelfth day of June, 1850, confirmed by the Public Health Supplemental Act, 1850 (No* 2f) , the Public Health Act, 1848, was duly applied to the District of Sandgate in the County of Kent, as described in the above-mentioned Provisional Order.

And whereas the Local Board of Health for the said District have borrowed under that Act, and with the authority of the General Board of Health, sums, amounting in the whole to Four thousand Pounds, to defray the expense of works for supplying water to the said District, and for other works of a permanent nature under the aforesaid Act, a portion of which said sums now remains due and owing from such Local Board; and whereas a further pum will be required to carry out and complete works of a permanent nature, for improving and extending the supply of water to the said District, but such further sum, together with the debt now charged upon such District in respect of the unpaid portion of the hereinbefore mentioned 4,000l., will exceed the assessable value for one year of the premises assessable under the said Act within such District,

And whereas the said Board have now, under the authority of the 78th Section of the Local Government Act, 1858, petitioned me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, for powers to borrow or re-borrow for such works, on mortgage of the rates leviable by the aforesaid Local Board of Health under the powers of the Public Health Act, 1848, and the Local Government Act, 1858, a sum or sums which shall not exceed in the whole two years assessable value of the premises assessable within the District in respect of which such sum or sums may be borrowed or re-borrowed.

An4 whereas after due inquiry and report by Alfred Dickens, Esquire, the Inspector appointed by me for the purpose, I am of opinion that the prayer of such Petition should be granted; but the same cannot be done without the consent of Parliament.

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the power now vested in me as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State as aforesaid, I do hereby, by this Provisional Order under my Hand, direct as follows: —

: That, from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this present Order — 1. — The Local Board of Health for the District of Sandgate in the County of Kent shall have power and authority to borrow or to re-borrow, for the execution and completion of the aforesaid works within such District, and on mortgage of the rates leviable by them under the aforesaid Acts, an amount not exceeding in the whole Five thousand nine hundred Pounds, including therein the existing debt of the said Board in respect of such works, and the sum now estimated to be required for the completion of the works as herein-before described, such amount of Five thousand nine hundred Pounds, not exceeding in the whole two years assessable value of the premises assessable under such Acts within the aforesaid .

none of the Masters were any longer necessary for the due Execution of thfe Busibetoflf

the said Court it should be lawful for him to release every remaining Master: And whereto

since the passing of the last-mentioned Act One of the Masters in Ordinary of the saSi ' Court ha9 died, and all the others have been released except Three, Two of whom ate

quite incapable from Ill-health of performing the Duties of their Office, and the othefbf 1 whom is of advanced Age and very infirm, and has held the Office of Master in the Court 1 of Exchequer and the Court of Chancery for the Period of Thirty-nine Tears and

upwards: And whereas it has heen considered desirable for the better Dischaigb Of'ffie ' Business of the said Court that the Causes and Matters now remaining in the GffifeSrof ' the said Masters should he transferred to the Judges Chambers, and accordingly the Lord :€ Chancellor, with the Advice and Assistance of all the Judges of the Court, has, by Order ' bearing Date the Twenty^third Day of August One thousand eight hundred and sixty,

ordered and directed that all Causes, Matters, and Things now depending before the Masters shall be proceeded with and prosecuted before the respective Judges of thO Court:

' And whereas the only Duty now remaining to be performed by the Masters is that'bf ' visiting the Prison ae required by the first-recited Act* and it is expedient that they should ' be relieved from such Duty, and that some other Provision should be made for: the Performance thereof: And whereas it is also expedient that some further Provision should be ' made for the Relief of Prisoners in Custody for Contempt of the said Court: And

whereas since the Date of the first herein-before recited Act various Alterations hbvt been ' made in the Practice and Procedure of the said Court, by reason whereof (Several of the ' Rules and Regulations contained in the same Act may require to be varied, and it is

expedient that the Lord Chancellor should have Power to make such General Orders as

' may from Time to Time be necessary in that Behalf:* Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows: T 1 '

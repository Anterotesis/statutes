SHIPLEY.

Provisional Order for extending the Borrowing Powers of the Shipley Local Board of Health.— Local Government Act, 1858.

Whereas, by an Order of Her most Gracious Majesty in Council, bearing date the Twenty-first day of February 1853, the Public Health Act, 1848, was duly applied to the Township of Shipley, in the Parish of Bradford, in the County of York, and the said Township was thereby constituted a District under that Act.

And whereas the Local Board of Health of the said District have borrowed under that Act, and under the Shipley Waterworks and Police Act, 1854, sums amounting in the whole to Twenty-nine thousand five hundred Pounds, to defray the expense of a portion of the works for sewering, and supplying water to, the said District, which said sums at the time the borrowing of them was sanctioned equalled the assessable value for one year of the premises assessable under that Act within such District, and the amount authorized by the second herein-before cited Act to be borrowed, but such sums were not sufficient to defray the cost of completing the works for the purposes aforesaid.

And whereas the said Local Board have, under the authority of the 78th Section of the Local Government Act, 1858, petitioned me, as one of Her Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State, for power to borrow or reborrow, for or on account of such works of sewerage and water supply, a further sum or sums, not exceeding in the whole two years’ assessable value of the premises assessable within such District; and whereas the said further sum or sums are proposed to be repaid within a period of fifty years from the date of the borrowing thereof.

And whereas, after due inquiry and report by Alfred Dickens, Esquire, the Inspector appointed for the purpose, it appears expedient that the prayer of such Petition should, to the extent herein-after set forth and described, be granted; but the same cannot be done without the consent of Parliament.

Now,

Executors, or Administrators in their Administration of their Ancestors, Testators, or Intestates Estates, in consequence whereof such Heirs, Executors, or Administrators have been held to have lost the Protection which they enjoyed under the said first-recited Act, and it is expedient that the same should be restored: Be it therefore declared and enacted, That no Judgment which has not already been or which shall not hereafter be entered or docketed undef the several Acts now in force, and which passed subsequently to the said Act of the Fourth and Fifth Years of King William and Queen , so as to bind Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments as against Purchasers, Mortgagees, or Creditors, shall have any Preference against Heirs, Executors, or Administrators in their Administration of their Ancestors, Testators, or Intestates Estates.

And whereas the Board of Tunbridge Wells Improvement Commissioners, having taken into consideration the wishes of the general body of Ratepayers as expressed at such meetings, and also the altered condition of the Town since the passing of the Tunbridge Wells Improvement Act, 1846, are likewise of opinion that a change is become necessary, and that it is further desirable to reduce the number of Commissioners to twenty-four, the same to be elected by the Ratepayers.

And whereas, with a view to facilitate this change, the said Commissioners have adopted the seventy-seventh section of the Local Government Act, 1858, and have under the powers of the said Section petitioned me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, to make a Provisional Order partially to repeal or alter, and provide for the future execution of the said Tunbridge Wells Improvement Act, 1846.

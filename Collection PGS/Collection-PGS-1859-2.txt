of Knighton, in the County of Radnor, and the said Borough was thereby constituted a District under that Act.

And whereas the Local Board of the said District have borrowed under that Act, and with the authority of the General Board of Health, sums amounting in the whole to Two thousand seven hundred and eighty Pounds, to defray the expenses of a portion of the works for sewering, and supplying water to, the said District, which said sums at the time the borrowing of them was sanctioned equalled the assessable value for one year of the premises assessable under that Act within such District, but were not sufficient to defray the cost of completing the works for the purposes aforesaid.

And whereas the said Local Board have, under the authority of the 78th section of the Local Government Act, 1858, petitioned the Right Honourable Spencer Horatio Walpole, at the date of the said petition one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, for power to* borrow a further sum or sums, not exceeding in the whole Three thousand nine hundred and forty-nine Pounds Four Shillings and Fivepence, in order to enable such Local Board to pay off their existing debt, and also to defray the cost of completing the works for sewering and supplying water to, their District; and whereas such further sum or sums will not exceed two years' assessable value of the premises assessable within such District; and whereas the said further sum or sums are proposed to be repaid within a period of fifty years from the date of the borrowing thereof.

And whereas, after due inquiry and report by William Ranger, Esquire, the Inspector appointed for the purpose, and after the assent by the ratepayers of the aforesaid District in public meeting assembled, it appears expedient that the prayer of such Petition should be granted; but the same cannot be done without the consent of Parliament.

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the power now vested in me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, I do' hereby, by this Provisional Order under my Hand, direct as follows:—

That from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this present Order—

The Local Board of Health for the District of Knighton, in the County of Radnor, shall have power and authority to . borrow, for the execution and completion of works of sewerage and water supply within such District, on mortgage of the rates leviable by them under the Local Government Act, 1858, an amount not exceeding in the whole Four thousand Pounds, to be repaid, with interest thereon, within a period of fifty years from the date of the borrowing thereof.

Given under my Hand this 19th day of July 1859.

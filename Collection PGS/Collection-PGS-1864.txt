RHYL.

Provisional Order of the Board of Trade for the Construction, Maintenance, and Regulation of

a Pier at Rhyl, in the County of Flint

Whereas, under The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, and The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, Amendment Act, the promoters of the Rhyl Promenade Pier Company Limited made application by a Memorial to the Lords of the Committee of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council appointed for the consideration of matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations, herein-after called the Board of Trade, setting forth the necessity of a pier at Rhyl, in the county of Flint, and praying their Lordships to approve of the project thus submitted, and to grant a Provisional Order for its execution, containing powers and privileges for the complete execution of the works, and for the levying of rates and tolls not exceeding those herein-after specified:

And whereas the estimated expenditure on the proposed works is thirteen thousand pounds and no more:

And whereas the promoters have published the advertisements and deposited the documents which by the last-mentioned Act they were required to publish and deposit:

And whereas the Board of Trade, after making such inquiries as they have thought expedient, have settled this present Provisional Order, and intend to cause a Bill to be introduced into Parliament for the purpose of obtaining an Act for the confirmation of this Provisional Order (until which confirmation this Provisional Order will not be of any validity or force whatever):

Now, therefore, the Board of Trade do by this their Provisional Order in pursuance of The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, and The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, Amendment Act, and by virtue and in exercise of the powers thereby respectively in them vested, and of every other power enabling them in this behalf, order —

That from and immediately after the passing of an Act of Parliament confirming this Provisional Order, the following provisions shall take effect and be in force:

1. The Rhyl Promenade Pier Company Limited, herein-after called the Company, shall be the undertakers of the works authorized by this Order.

2. For the purposes of the works authorized by this Order, the Company may from time to time, by agreement, enter on, take, and use all or any part of the lands shown on the deposited plans, as intended to be taken for the purposes of the proposed works.

3. The Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and The Lands Clauses Consolidation Acts Amendment Act, 1860, except so much thereof respectively as relates to the purchase and taking of lands otherwise than by agreement, shall be incorporated with this Order.

4. Subject to the provisions of this Order, and subject also to such alterations, if any, in the deposited plans as the Board of Trade may require from time to time before the completion of the works in order to prevent injury to navigation, the Company may, on the lands taken by them under this Order, and in the lines and according to the levels and within the limits of deviation shown on the deposited plans and sections, make and maintain the works shown on the deposited plans.

5. The works authorized by this Order comprise the following:

A pier commencing below the east parade opposite or near to the end of Church Street, with limits of deviation laterally to the baths on the east, and to High Street on the west, in the parochial township of Rhyl, in the parish of Rhydlan, in the county of Flint, and extending seaward one thousand and fifty-six yards or thereabouts in a north-easterly direction.

6. The Company may demand and receive in respect of the vessels^ goods, persons, and things in the Schedule hereto described any sums not exceeding the rates in the Schedule specified.

7. The Company may grant to passengers and promenaders or others pass tickets for the use of the pier on such terms and for such a period, not exceeding one year, as may be agreed upon, but so that no preference be given to any person. A pass ticket shall not be transferable, and shall not be used by any person except the person to whom it is granted, or by any person after the period limited for its use.

EXE BIGHT.

Provisional Order of the Board of Trade for the Construction, Maintenance, and Regulation of a Pier in the Exe Bight in the Harbour of the River Exe in the County of %Devon.

Whereas, under The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, and The General Pier and Preamble. Harbour Act, 1861, Amendment Act, the Right Honourable William Reginald Earl of Devon made application by memorial to the Lords of the Committee of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council appointed for the consideration of matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations, herein-after called the Board of Trade, praying the Board of Trade to make a Provisional Order under the said Acts, and thereby to empower the said William Reginald Earl of Devon, as promoter, to construct a pier on the soil and bed of the River Exe and lands adjoining thereto and contiguous to that part of the River Exe called the Exe Bight in the county of Devon, to complete the execution of the works, to levy tolls and rates, and also to borrow a sum, not exceeding fifteen thousand pounds, on the security of the said rates, for the construction of such works as aforesaid:

And whereas the estimated expenditure on the said works is fifteen thousand pounds, and no more:

And whereas the promoter published the advertisements and deposited the documents which he was by the last-mentioned Act required to publish and deposit:

And whereas the said William Reginald Earl of Devon has undertaken the construction of an embankment on the foreshore of the river Exe, extending from Starcross to Warren Point, (which proposed embankment was approved, so far as regards navigation, by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty by Order dated the 5th day of December 1862,) and the proposed pier is intended to be constructed in connexion with that embankment:

And whereas it is expedient that the site and dimensions of the proposed pier be under the control of the Board of Trade, with a view to the prevention of injury to the navigation of the river Exe:

And whereas the proposed embankment is likely to be completed in the course of the year 1864, but until it is completed the proper site and dimensions for the proposed pier cannot be determined:

And whereas the Board of Trade, after making such inquiries as they have thought expedient, have settled this present Provisional Order, and intend to cause a Bill to be introduced into Parliament for the purpose of obtaining an Act for confirmation of this Provisional Order (until which confirmation this Provisional Order will not be of any validity or force whatever):

Now, therefore, the Board of Trade do by this their Provisional Order, in pursuance of The General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, and The General Pier and Harbour Act,

1861, Amendment Act, and by virtue and in exercise of the powers thereby respectively in them vested, and of every other power enabling them in this behalf, order —

That, from and immediately after the passing of the Act of Parliament confirming this Provisional Order, the following provisions shall take effect, and be in force:

1. The said William Reginald Earl of Devon, his heirs and assigns, or other his successors Undertaker *, in estate, shall be the undertakers of the works authorized by this Order.

the Commissioners of Excise have, since the Demise of His said late Majesty, caused the said Hereditary Duties to be charged on all Beer, Ale, and Cider brewed or made in Great Britain, but the Amount thereof has not yet been collected: And whereas the whole of the Duties on Beer, Ale, and Cider having been repealed by the said recited Act, save and except the said Hereditary Duties, it is expedient to make Provision that the said Hereditary Duties also shall not be collected or paid during the Continuance of this Act, and that the Sums already charged in respect thereof should be remitted Be it therefore enacted, That during the Continuance of this Act the said Hereditary Duties on Ale, Beer, and Cider shall not be charged, collected, or paid, or be chargeable or payable; and it shall be lawful for the Commissioners of Excise, and they are hereby authorized and required, to remit and discharge the Amount of the said Duties in the several Cases in which they have been charged but not collected as aforesaid: Provided always, that if the Heir or Successor of Her Majesty (whom God long preserve) shall signify His or Her Royal Will and Pleasure, in manner herein-after provided, to resume the Possession of the several Hereditary Revenues of the Crown, the said Hereditary Duties on Ale, Beer, and Cider shall from thenceforth revive, and be again charged, collected, and paid for the Use of such Heir or Successor, and His or Her Heirs and Successors, in the Manner provided by the said recited Act.

IX. Provided always, and be it enacted, That if any Saving or Surplus shall arise in any Quarter in respect of any Money appropriated for defraying the Charges of any particular Class, so as that the Sum appropriated thereto shall be more than sufficient for the full and complete Payment of the Charges thereon, such quarterly Saving or Surplus shall in every such Case be carried forward in the Exchequer to the Account and Credit and be applied for the Purposes of the Class in which it shall have arisen, until the Thirty-first Day of December in every Year; and whenever any such Saving or Surplus remaining at the End of the Year shall have arisen in any of the Classes of the Civil List, then it shall be lawful for the Lord High Treasurer, or Commissioners of the Treasury for the Time being, or any Three or more of them, to direct the same to be applied in aid of the Charges or Expences of any other Class (except the Fifth Class), or of any Charge or Charges upon Her Majesty's Civil List Revenues, in such Manner as may, under the Circumstances, appear to be most expedient: Provided always, that the Charge upon the Fifth Class shall in no Case exceed the Sum by this Act limited for that Class.

XI. And whereas Doubts may be entertained whether the Provisions of the Acts relating to the Civil List Revenues have expired with the Civil List Revenue of His late Majesty King William the Fourth, by the Decease of His late Majesty; be it therefore enacted and declared, That all the Provisions, Regulations, Restrictions, Clauses, Matters, and Things

An Act to amend the Act for the Abolition of Slavery in the British Colonies.

[11th April 1838.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the Fourth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty, intituled An Act for the Abolition of Slavery throughout the British Colonies; for promoting the Industry of the manumitted Slaves; and for compensating the Persons hitherto entitled to the Services of such Slaves: And whereas, in pursuance of the Powers for that Purpose

1° VICTORIAE, c. 19. 93

in the said Act contained, divers Orders in Council, Ordinances, and Acts of Assembly have been made for giving Effect to the said Act by supplementary Enactments in the said Colonies: And whereas it hath since appeared that further Provisions are necessary for the Protection of the apprenticed Labourers in the said Colonies, and for giving full Effect to the Intent and Meaning of the said Act for the Abolition of Slavery Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall be lawful for the Governor of each Colony in which this Act shall be in force to regulate from Time to Time, by Proclamation, by and with the Advice of the Council, the Distribution of the Hours of legal Labour of apprenticed Labourers within such Colony; and that after such Proclamation it shall not be lawful to employ any Apprentice in that Colony, unless by voluntary Contract, otherwise than according to such proclaimed Regulation; provided that no such Regulation shall lessen, save as herein-after provided, the whole Amount of weekly Labour which may be lawfully required of Apprentices within that Colony.

II. And be it enacted, That it shall be lawful, by any such Proclamation as aforesaid, to make Provision for reckoning as Part of the legal Time of compulsory Labour the Time necessary to enable the Apprentices to go, at any Rate not exceeding Three Miles by the Hour, to and from their Labour from and to their respective Places of Abode, and such necessary Times shall be reckoned and allowed accordingly in the whole Amount of weekly Labour which may be lawfully required of such Apprentices.

III. And whereas Provision was made by the said Act of Parliament for securing to apprenticed Labourers during the Continuance of their Apprenticeship the like Food, Clothing, Lodging, Medicine, Medical Attendance, and other Maintenance and Allowances which the Person or Persons for the Time being entitled to their Services was or were required to supply, provide, and allow to them whilst in the State of Slavery: And whereas in certain Cases Exemptions from Labour, Allowances of Food or other Articles, and other Privileges and Indulgences, were given to Slaves in the said Colonies either by Law or Custom, the Continuance of which has not been sufficiently provided for by Law, and which therefore are not in all Cases enjoyed by the said apprenticed Labourers; be it therefore enacted, That all Exemptions from Labour, Allowances, Privileges, and Indulgences to which in his or her State of Slavery any apprenticed Labourer was or would have been entitled by Law, or by any Custom established for the Space of Three Years at least before the passing of the said Act of Parliament in any of the said Colonies, or in any District or Parish thereof, shall, after having been ascertained and declared as herein-after provided, during the Continuance of the said Apprenticeship in that Colony, be fully and of Right enjoyed by the apprenticed Labourers in such Colony, District, or Parish respectively; and every Person entitled to the Services of any apprenticed Labourer who, by himself or herself, or by his or her Agent, shall withhold from or not allow to any such Apprentice all such usual Exemptions, Allowances, Privileges, and Indulgences as aforesaid, shall be liable to the same Penalties in all respects as if he or she had not supplied to such Apprentice the Allowances which by the said Act of Parliament he or she was required to supply to such Apprentice, unless by voluntary Contract, sanctioned by the Special Justice of the District, any other Arrangement shall be made between any Employer and his or her Apprentices; and no apprenticed Labourer from whom such Allowances shall be withheld shall be liable to Punishment for Deficiency of Work during the Period for which such Allowance shall be withheld.

IV. And be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Governor of every such Colony, with the Advice of his Council, to inquire from Time to Time, and thereupon for the Governor to declare by Proclamation, what Exemptions, Allowances, Privileges, or Indulgences have been so established within that Colony or in any District or Parish thereof; and every such Proclamation shall have the Force of Law in that Colony.

V. And be it enacted, That the Proprietor or the Representative of the Proprietor of any Estate on which any Apprentice shall be confined in any Prison, Workhouse, or Hospital by the Procurance of such Proprietor, or his or her authorized Agent, Representative, or

VI. And be it enacted, That in any of the said Colonies in which no Provision shall be in force at the Time of the Proclamation of this Act for the Appointment of an Umpire to act in default of the Parties whose Concurrence is necessary to the Completion of the Appraisement of the Value of the Services of any such Apprentice seeking his or her Discharge from Apprenticeship, or in the Case of an alleged excessive Valuation of the Services of any apprenticed Labourer by such Parties, it shall be lawful for the Governor, if he shall think fit, to appoint, by Warrant under his Hand and the Public Seal of the Colony, so many Persons as he shall think necessary to be official Umpires of Appraisement in that Colony; and the Names and Places of the Abode of the Persons so appointed shall be published in the Public Gazette of the Colony: Provided always, that no such official Umpire shall take on himself to act in that Capacity until he shall have been sworn before some Justice of the Peace to act fairly and impartially in the Execution of his Office.

VII. And be it enacted, That in every Case in which an Appraisement of the Sum which ought to be given for the Discharge of any Apprentice cannot be completed because of the Disagreement or Default of the Persons appointed to value and appraise the same, according to the Laws in force in that Colony before the passing of this Act, or in the Case of such excessive Valuation as aforesaid, it shall be lawful for the Governor in every Colony in which such official Umpires shall have been appointed under this Act, on the Application of any Person whose Concurrence in the Appraisement is necessary to the Completion thereof, or of any Person interested therein, or of any Person on his or her Behalf, to direct the Valuation to be made by One of the said official Umpires, who shall thereupon proceed to fix a Value upon such Apprentice, which Valuation shall be binding and conclusive on all Parties; and upon the Amount of such Valuation being paid as by Law directed, such Apprentice shall be absolutely discharged from the Remainder of his or her Term of Apprenticeship.

VIII. And be it enacted, That in such Cases as aforesaid the said official Umpire alone shall have Authority and shall be required to give the like Notices and to perform all Acts and observe all Forms necessary for completing the Discharge of the said Apprentice* as fully as the Persons first appointed for the Purpose of completing such Discharge had Power or were required to do, or as near thereunto as may be; and the Governor, widi the Advice of his Council, shall have Power in every such Colony to make such Regulations as may be necessary for adapting the Form of Procedure in that Colony to the Case of an Umpire acting alone in making and completing such Appraisement and Discharge.

IX. And be it enacted, That no Supervisor or other Person in charge of any House of Correction, Workhouse, or other Place of Confinement shall receive into his Custody as a Prisoner any Person under Charge of being a vagrant or runaway Apprentice unless under a Warrant of Committal to that particular Place of Confinement, signed by a Justice holding a Special Commission under the Provisions of the said Act of Parliament; any Law or Custom to the contrary notwithstanding.

X. And be it enacted, That every Supervisor or Person having Charge of any Place of Confinement who shall neglect to advertise the Name and Description of any apprenticed Labourer committed to such Place of Confinement as a vagrant or runaway Apprentice, the Date of every such Committal, and the Name of the committing Magistrates, as by Law required, or who shall detain, except under legal Sentence, any such apprenticed Labourer beyond the Time required by Law for such Advertisement, shall be liable to a Penalty, at the Discretion of any Two Special Justices before whom he shall be convicted of such Offence, not exceeding the Rate of One Pound Sterling in each Case for each Day during which he shall have made such Default or shall have illegally detained any such apprenticed Labourer.

XII.

XIII. And be it enacted, That every Person who shall obstruct or oppose any such Special Justice exercising or attempting to exercise any of the Rights or Powers hereby committed to him shall for any such Offence be proceeded against, and on Conviction thereof shall be punished in the same Manner as any Person may now by Law be proceeded against and punished in the same Colony for obstructing any Special Justice appointed in pursuance of the said recited Act of Parliament in the Discharge of his Office.

XV. And be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for any Special Justice or Justices in any of the said Colonies, in every Case in which he or they shall have convicted any Person or Persons of any Wrong or Injury done to any apprenticed Labourer or Labourers, and shall have adjudged such Person or Persons respectively to pay any line or Penalty which under any Law in force such Justice or Justices is or are authorized to impose, to award the Whole or any Part of such Penalty to the apprenticed Labourer or Labourers against whom the Offence in respect of such Conviction shall take place shall have been committed.

XVI. And for the more effectual Prevention of Cruelty and Injustice towards the said apprenticed Labourers, be it enacted, That if it shall be made to appear to the Satisfaction of the Governor of any such Colony that any apprenticed Labourer hath been subjected to any Cruelty or any grievous Injustice or Wrong done to or inflicted upon him or her by the Person or Persons entitled to his or her Services, or by the authorized Agent, Representative, or Servant of any such Person or Persons, or in the Execution of any Punishment inflicted for any Offence against the said Act of Parliament, or any Act or Ordinance made in pursuance of the said Act of Parliament, or for the Breach of any Regulation made for the Discipline of any Prison, Hospital, or Workhouse, or for any other Purpose, it shall be lawful for the Governor, by any Order to be for that Purpose made by him under his Hand, and sealed with the Public Seal of the Colony, to direct the immediate Discharge of any such apprenticed Labourer for his or her remaining

An Act for the Consolidation of the Offices of First Fruits, Tenths, and Queen Anne's Bounty.

[11th April 1838.]

WHEREAS Her most gracious Majesty Queen Anne, in Her Royal Bounty to the Poor ' Clergy of the Church of England, and pursuant to and by virtue of an Act of Parliament made in the Second Year of Her said Majesty's Reigit, intituled An Act for making 2 Anne, c. 11. more effectual Her Majesty'$ gracious Intentions for the Augmentation of the Maintenance of the Poor Clergy, by enabling Her Majesty to grant in perpetuity the Revenues of the First Fruits and Tenths, and also for enabling other Persons to make Grants for the same Purpose, did, in and by Her Letters Patent under the Great Seal of England, bearing Date the TTiird Day of November in the Third Year of Her said Majesty's Reign, make, nominate, constitute, and appoint the Persons therein named to be One Body Pody Politic and Corporate by the Name of The Governors of the Bounty of Queen Anne for the Augmentation of the Maintenance of the Poor Clergy," with such Powers and Authorities as are therein mentioned and expressed; and did in and by the said Letters Patent give and grant unto the said Governors of the Bounty of Queen Anne for the Augmentation of the Maintenance of the Poor Clergy, and their Successors, all the Revenues of the First Fruits and yearly perpetual Tenths of all Dignities, Offices, Benefices, and Promotions Spiritual whatsoever payable to Her said Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors, by virtue of any Act or Acts of Parliament whatsoever, and all Arrears of the said First Fruits and Tenths (except as therein is excepted), to be applied and disposed of by the said Governors thereby constituted to and for such Ends, Intents, and Purposes as in and by the said Letters Patent are contained and directed: And whereas by virtue of an Act of Parliament made and passed in the First Year of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, intituled An Act for the Restitution of First 1 Eliz. c 4. Fruits to the Crown, the said Revenues of First Fruits and yearly perpetual Tenths are within the Order, Survey, Rule, and Governance of Her Majesty's Court of Exchequer: And whereas His Majesty King Charles the Second, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of England, bearing Date the Tw'enty-fourth Day of January in the Thirty-first Year of His Reign, did give and grant unto Marmaduke Gibbs Esquire, his Heirs and Assigns, the Office of Remembrancer of First Fruits and Tenths in His Majesty's Court of Exchequer, to hold

: i G. 1. C. 10.

1° VICTORIAE, c. 20.

1 the said Office unto the said Marmaduke Gibbs, his Heirs and Assigns, by himself or by his

or their sufficient Deputy or Deputies for ever, immediately and so soon after the Date of the said Letters Patent as the said Office should become vacant as therein mentioned, and which soon afterwards happened, upon Trust that he the said Marmaduke Gibbs, his Heirs and Assigns, should stand seised of the said Office, with the Wages, Fees, and Emoluments thereof (except as therein mentioned), for Henry Duke of Grafton, his Heirs and Assigns, as in the said Letters Patent is mentioned: And whereas by an Act passed in the Third Year of the Reign of King George the First, intituled An Act for the better collecting and

levying the Revenue of the Tenths of the Clergy, it was amongst other things enacted, that from

5 and after the Twenty-sixth Day of December then last past there should be One Collector or Receiver of the said perpetual yearly Tenths of all Dignities, Offices, Benefices, and Promotions Spiritual whatsoever, granted to the said Corporation of the Governors of the Bounty of Queen Anne for the Augmentation of the Maintenance of the Poor Clergy by the said first-recited Act and Letters Patent, (which had not been legally discharged by any Act or Acts since made, or otherwise,) from Time to Time to be appointed by His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, by His or Their Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Great Britain, as in the said Act now in recital is mentioned; which said Collector or Receiver should be and was thereby charged and chargeable to levy, collect, and receive all such Sums of Money wherewith all and every such Dignities, Offices, Benefices, and Promotions Spiritual were charged and chargeable for and towards the Payment of the said perpetual ' yearly Tenths; and should pay and content the said Sums of Money yearly into the Receipt of His Majesty's Exchequer at Westminster, in such Manner and Form as was therein-after mentioned: And whereas under or by virtue of the several Acts and Letters Patent hereinbefore mentioned or referred to, and other Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent of the Crown, the said Revenue of First Fruits is now collected and received in a certain Office called the Office of First Fruits, which Office is a Branch of the said Court of Exchequer, and consists of Four Officers; videlicet, a Remembrancer of First Fruits and Tenths, who

holds his Office in Fee under or by virtue of the said Letters Patent of King Charles the Second, a Collector or Receiver, and Two sworn Clerks; and the Revenue of yearly Tenths is in the first instance collected and received by a Collector or Receiver, who holds his Office under or by virtue of the said Act of the Third Year of King George the First, or Letters 4. Patent granted in pursuance thereof, and has Two Clerks for his Assistance in the Business of such Collection and Receipt; and the said Revenues of First Fruits and yearly Tenths are from Time to Time paid by the respective Collectors or Receivers thereof into the Bank of England, to the Account of Her Majesty's Exchequer; and the same Monies, or the Amount thereof, are or is afterwards from Time to Time paid to the Treasurer for the Time being of the said Governors of the Bounty of Queen Anne for the Augmentation of the Maintenance of the Poor Clergy: And whereas the Names of the present Officers employed in the said Offices of First Fruits and Tenths for the Collection, Receipt, and Payment, in manner aforesaid, of the said Revenue of First Fruits and yearly perpetual Tenths,

and the average yearly Amount of the Emoluments of all such Officers respectively, arising from Salaries and Fees, or otherwise (as stated by such Officers respectively), and the annual Expences of the said Offices for Rent, Salary to an Office Keeper, Stationery, Coals,

Candles, and other incidental Matters, are set forth in the Schedule to this Act, and amount in the whole to the yearly Sum of Two thousand and twenty-two Pounds Eighteen Shillings and Eleven-pence: And whereas the Method at present in use for the Collection and Receipt of the said First Fruits and Tenths by the said several Officers respectively, and the Payment of the same into the Bank of England to the Account of Her Majesty's Exchequer,

and the subsequent Payment thereof to the Treasurer of the Governors of the Bounty of Queen Anne, as herein-before mentioned, is unnecessarily circuitous, complicated, and expensive; and it is therefore expedient that the said Office of Remembrancer of First Fruits and Tenths, and the said several Offices of Collectors or Receivers of First Fruits and Tenths, and the Clerkships attached to the same Offices respectively, should be abolished, and that the Collection and Receipt as well as the Expenditure and Application of the whole Revenue of First Fruits and Tenths should be placed under the Management of the said Governors of the Bounty of Queen Anne, and their Treasurer for the Time being under their immediate Control, by which Means the Collection and Receipt of the said First Fruits

and

so taking or obtaining the same should be and was thereby made and declared utterly disable and incapable to have, hold, or enjoy any such Gift, Grant, Estate, or Interest: And whereas,

notwithstanding the Provisions in the said Act made and enacted, many Encroachments have been made and continued on the Waste Lands of the said Forest: And whereas by

virtue and under the Authority of an Act passed in the First and Secbnd Years of the Reigri of His late Majesty King William the Fourth, intituled An Act for ascertaining the Boundaries of the Forest of Dean, for inquiring into the Rights and Privileges claimed by the Free Miners of the Hundred of St. Briavels, and for other Purposes, a Commission was issued under the Seal of Her Majesty's Court of Exchequer, bearing Date the Twenty-first Day of January One thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, directed to certain Commissioners therein named, with Authority to them to inquire of and ascertain and distinguish the Boundaries of the Forest of Dean, and of the Lands of Her Majesty's Subjects within the same, and to inquire of the Purprestures, Encroachments, and Trespasses on the Soil of the Crown within the Boundaries of the said Forest, and also to inquire of the Existence, Origin, and Particulars of the Rights and Privileges claimed by Persons born within the Hundred of 4 St. Briavels, within the Boundary of the said Forest, calling themselves Free Miners, and the said Commissioners were by the said Commission directed to report on the aforesaid Matters to the Lord High Treasurer or Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury as in the said Commission is mentioned: And whereas the said Commissioners so appointed as aforesaid proceeded to make the Inquiries so as aforesaid directed to be made, and by their Second Report to the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, under their Hands and Seals, dated the First Day of May One thousand eight hundred and thirty-four, and which Report is stated by them to relate to the Boundaries of the Forest of Dean and of the Lands of Her Majesty's Subjects within the same, and the Rights and Interests of Persons occupying or claiming to be interested in Lands or Tenements within the Bounds of the said Forest, the Origin or alleged Origin of such Rights and Interests, and also the Dates, Value, and other Particulars of all other Purprestures, Encroachments, and Trespasses in and upon the Soil of Her Majesty within the said Forest, after stating, amongst other things in the said Report, that the said Commissioners had confined their Attention to Encroachments in the said Forest properly so called, and that they had found it necessary to have Maps prepared, in which the Encroachments described as such in a certain Map 4 made in the Year One thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, in pursuance of the Report of certain Commissioners, should be laid down distinct from those of a more modern Date; and also stating that in the Maps so prepared under the Direction of the said Commissioners whose Report is now in recital, (and which Maps are annexed to the said Report,) the old Encroachments were coloured Red, those which were taken in between the Years One thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven and One thousand eight hundred and twelve Blue, and those inclosed since the Year One thousand eight hundred and twelve Yellow; that every Facility, by repeated Notices given generally and individually, had been afforded to the several Parties in Possession of Lands coloured Blue and Yellow to appeal against the Colour by which their Encroachments were distinguished, and nearly all of them appeared before the said Commissioners in Person or by Proxy; that the few who did not so appear received further Notice of the Day appointed for final Adjudication; that all Red Encroachments were included in One Class, because the said Commissioners could not presume that any of them were inclosed before the said Act of the Twentieth Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second; but the Crown having had its Attention called by the Proceedings of the Commissioners appointed in One thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, as in the said Report is mentioned, to the Existence of these Red Encroachments, and not having taken any effectual Steps to assert its Right,

ought not to disturb the Possession; the said Commissioners by their said Report therefore recommended that the Lands coloured Red in the said Plans (amounting to One thousand five hundred and ten Acres Two Roods and Thirty-two Perches) should be declared to be Freehold of Inheritance, subject however to a Condition that no additional Dwelling Houses should be erected thereon without the Licence of the Crown, to be registered in the Court of Attachments; and that the Lands coloured Blue in the said Plans, containing Five hundred and seventy-three Acres and Ten and a Half Perches, should be granted to their present Possessors for Three Lives, not renewable except at the Pleasure of the Crown, and

WHEREAS by an Act passed in the Fifty-fourth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, intituled An Act to alter and amend certain of the Powers and Provisions of several Acts passed for the Redemption and Sale of the Land Tax, and for making 6 farther Provision for the Redemption thereof it was enacted, that it should be lawful for His said Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, from Time to Time, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Great Britain, to nominate and appoint any Person or Persons, being a Peer or Peers of the Realm, or a Member or Members of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, to be a Commissioner or Commissioners for the Purposes of regulating, directing, approving, and confirming all Sales and Contracts for Sale, Enfranchisements, Mortgages,

and Grants of Rent-charges which should be made by any Bodies Politic or Corporate, or Companies, or Feoffees or Trustees for charitable or other public Purposes, of or out of any Manors, Messuages, Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments belonging to such Bodies Politic or Corporate, or Companies, or Feoffees or T rustees for charitable or other public Purposes,

by virtue of a certain Act of the Forty-second Year of His said Majesty, or of any subsequent Acts relating to the Redemption and Sale of the Land Tax, or of the said recited Act; and also for the Purpose of regulating, directing, approving, and confirming all Sales and Enfranchisements which by virtue of the said several Acts, or any of them, should be made of any Manors, Messuages, Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments wherein His said Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, had or should have any Estate, Right, or Interest in Possession, Remainder, Reversion, or Expectancy by any Person or Persons holding under any Grant from the Crown, or under any Act of Parliament: And whereas His late Majesty King William the Fourth, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Great Britain,

bearing Date the Seventeenth Day of June, in the First Year of His Reign, did nominate and appoint certain Persons therein named, being respectively Peers of the Realm or Members of His said Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, to be Commissioners for the Purposes in the said recited Act mentioned: And whereas the said Letters Patent have expired by reason of the Demise of His said late Majesty King William the Fourth, and have not been renewed; and it is expedient that the several Powers and Authorities heretofore exercised by the Commissioners appointed by the said Letters Patent, pursuant to the said recited Act, should be vested in and exercised by the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury for the Time being Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act all the several Powers and Authorities which, under or by virtue of any Act or Acts now in force relating to the Redemption and Sale of the Land Tax, were heretofore vested in or might have been vested in or used or exercised by any Person or Persons appointed or who might have been appointed a Commissioner or Commissioners by virtue of

54 G. S. c. 173.

Powers and Authorities heretofore exercised by the Commissioner1 appointed pursuant %e the

in Great Britain, it sometimes happens that Disputes arise as to the Division, Parish, or Place in which or in aid of which particular Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments are legally

liable to be rated; and by reason thereof such Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments are ' rated in the several Assessments made for Two or more of such Divisions, Parishes, or c Places respectively; and it is expedient to provide a summary Remedy for the Relief of the Owners or Occupiers of such Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments from such cumulative Charges of the Land Tax, and also to provide the Means of ascertaining and { determining the Division, Parish, or Place in which or in aid of which such Lands, Tene-6 ments, or Hereditaments are legally liable and ought to be rated to the Land Tax f be it therefore enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, upon Application to Her Majesty's Court of Exchequer in England and Scotland respectively, made by or on the Behalf of the Owner or Occupier of any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, by Affidavit or otherwise, showing that by reason of some Doubt or Dispute as to the Division, Parish, or Place in which or in aid of which such Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments are legally liable to be assessed to the Land Tax, the same or any Person or Persons in respect thereof have or hath been assessed, rated, or charged to the Land Tax in the several Assessments made for Two or more Divisions, Parishes, or Places, and that such Application is not made with a view to delay the Payment of the Land Tax which may be legally assessed or charged upon or in respect of such Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, and that the Party by whom or on whose Behalf such Application is made is ready to bring into Court or to pay or dispose of, in such Manner as the Court may order or direct, the Sum or Sums assessed or charged by the said several Assessments, or either of them, it shall be lawful for the Court to make Rules and Orders calling upon the respective Commissioners of the Land Tax acting for the several Divisions, Parishes, or Places in or for which the said several Assessments shall have been made, to appear and maintain the said Assessments, or to relinquish the same respectively, so far as the same relate to the Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments in question, and in the meantime to stay all Proceedings, by Distress or otherwise, against the Party assessed or charged in respect of such Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, for the levying or compelling Payment of the Sum or Sums so as aforesaid assessed; and it shall also be lawful for the Court, if it shall think proper, to order the Party by whom or on whose Behalf such Application shall be made to pay into Court the Sum or Sums assessed, or any Part thereof, to abide the Determination of the Dispute or to be disposed of as the Court may direct; and for determining the Question or Questions in dispute it shall be lawful for the Court to order the Trial of One or more feigned Issue or Issues upon such Point or Points as the Court shall think proper, and also to direct who shall be the Plaintiff or Plaintiffs and who shall be the Defendant or Defendants on such Trial, or otherwise to dispose of the Question or Questions in dispute and determine the same in a summary Manner, and to make such other Rules and Orders therein, as to Costs and all other Matters, as may appear to be just and reasonable.

And be it enacted, That in any Case where the Effect of any Composition may be by any Law now in force suspended in consequence of any Lease of Tithes, or Agreement in Writing respecting the same, every such Lease or Agreement having such TDffect as aforesaid, but none other, shall from and after the passing of this Act wholly cease and determine, but without Prejudice to the Recovery of any Sum heretofore accrued due by virtue thereof; and the Lands which would, if this Act had not been made, have upon the Termination of such Lease or Agreement become subject to the Payment of any Composition for Tithes, shall be and become severally charged with an annual Sum or Rent-charge equal to Three Fourths of the Amount of such Composition, and an annual Sum equal in Amount to such Rent-charge shall become payable to the Persons from Time to Time liable to the Payment of such Rent-charge, and to their Lessees and Sub-Lessees, in like Manner as herein-before provided in Cases where the Effect of such Composition shall not have been suspended as aforesaid: Provided nevertheless, that if any Payment on account of this present Year shall previous to the passing of this Act have accrued due by virtue of or under such Lease or Agreement, the Amount thereof shall be deducted from the Rent-charge accruing due on the First Day of November in this present Year, and the Residue only shall be then payable.

XII. And whereas by an Act passed in the Fourth Year of the Reign of His Majesty ' King George the Fourth, intituled An Act to provide for the Establishment of Compositions for

Tithes in Ireland for a limited Time, it was enacted, that whenever under the Provisions of

that Act any Composition should be made for Tithes payable in any Parish, every Person who should afterwards set, let, or demise any Land lying within such Parish at a Rack Rent ' should make such Lease or Demise free from the Payment of Tithes during the Continuance

of such Composition; and that in such Case it should be lawful for the Lessee or Occupier

14 of

1° & 2° VICTORIAE, c. 109.

of such Land, and every such Lessee or Occupier was thereby required, to pay the Amount c of such Composition to the Person entitled thereto; and that it should be lawful for such Lessee or Occupier of such Land to deduct the Amount of all such Payments from Time to Time out of the Amount of Rent payable by such Lessee or Occupier of such Land to his immediate Landlord; and it was further enacted by the said recited Act, that in case such Composition should cease and determine at any Time during the Continuance of such Lease, the Rent reserved in such Lease should be reduced in Amount by a Sum equal to the Amount of such Composition: And whereas in such Cases of Land set, let, or demised at a Rack Rent in any Parish at any Time after the Establishment of a Composition for Tithes therein the Amount of such Composition has by reason of the said recited Enactments been added to and made payable together with and as Part of the Rent, and it is just and reasonable that such Rent should be reduced to the Extent of the Reduction made under this Act in converting the said Composition into a Rent-charge; be it therefore enacted, That in case of any Lease made at a Rack Rent, at any Time after the Establishment of a Composition for Tithes in any Parish, of Lands subject to the Payment of such Composition, the Rent reserved upon and made payable in and by any such Lease shall be reduced by a Sum equal to the Difference between the Amount of the Composition heretofore payable in respect of such Lands and the Amount of the Rent-charge which will under the Provisions of this Act become payable in lieu thereof, and that the Party from Time to Time liable to the Payment of such Rent shall be entitled to deduct the Amount of such Difference accordingly: Provided always, that, subject to such Reduction, such Rent shall remain payable, and the Lessor, his Heirs, Executors, Administrators, and Assigns, shall have the like Remedies for the Recovery thereof as if the said Tithe Compositions were not by this Act determined.

XIII. And whereas in Cases where the said Compositions for Tithes have been established by a sole Commissioner appointed by the Lord Lieutenant, in pursuance of an Act passed in the Second and Third Years of the Reign of His late Majesty King William the Fourth,

intituled An Act to amend Three Acts passed respectively in the Fourth, Fifth, and in the Seventh and Eighth Years of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Fourth, providing for the establishing of Compositions for Tithes in Ireland, and to make such Compositions permanent, it is just and expedient, with a view to a final and satisfactory Settlement of the Amount of the said Compositions for Tithes, and the Rent-charges payable in lieu thereof, that Appeals should be allowed within a limited Time against the Certificates of such Compositions where the Amount thereof may have been unduly affected by Fraud or Concealmentbe it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for any Person or Persons in any Parish who would have been, in case this Act had not been made, individually or collectively liable to the Payment of more than One Half of the Amount of the whole Composition established in and for such Parish, whether the several Sums payable by him or them respectively shall be or may have been payable to any Party entitled to the Receipt of any Composition, or to any Landlord who may have taken upon him the Payment of such Composition, at any Time before the First Day of October next to appeal to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in Council in behalf of such Parish against the Certificate of such Composition, in like Manner as by the said Act of the Second and Third Years of His said late Majesty King William the Fourth, and the Acts therein recited, an Appeal might have been made by Direction of the Vestry of the Parish within the Time thereby limited, and the Grounds of such Appeal shall be stated in Writing and signed by such Person or Persons, and lodged with the Clerk of the Privy Council before the said First Day of October, and in like Manner it shall be lawful for any Person who would have been, in case this Act had not been made, entitled to any Composition for Tithes, before the said First Day of October, to appeal to the said Lord Lieutenant in Council against such Certificate in like Manner as by the said last-mentioned Acts such Appeals might have been made within the Time thereby limited; and Notice of every such Appeal shall be posted on the Church Door or usual Place of posting Notices of Application of Grand Jury Presentments in the Barony or Half Barony in which the Parish to which such Application may refer is situate, and once inserted by or on behalf of the Appellant Party in some Newspaper circulating within such Parish within Ten Days next after such Appeal shall have been lodged with the Clerk of the Privy Council; Provided always, that

be reduced ia proportion to the Difference between such Composition and the Rent-charge payable under thi* Act.

Compositions for Tithes made under 2 & 3 W. 4. c. 119. may be appealed against.

466 1° & 2° VICTORIAE, c. 109.

where the Effect of any Composition may have been suspended previous to the passing of this Act by virtue of any Lease or Agreement in Writing, the Owners and Occupiers of any Lands upon which collectively a Sum exceeding One Half of the Amount of such Composition may have been applotted shall be deemed and taken to be qualified within the Meaning of this Act to make such Appeal.

Appeals to be beard in the Manner provided by 2 & 3 \V. 4. c. 119 .;

but no Order to be made, except for confirming the Composition, unless Fraud, Concealment, or Misrepresentation affecting the Amount of Composition be proved.

XIV. And be it enacted, That every such Appeal shall be heard and determined, and an Order made thereupon for confirming or for decreasing or increasing or modifying the Amount of such Composition, in like Manner as is provided by the said last-mentioned Act with respect to Appeals thereby authorized to be made against such Certificates; and all the Enactments and Provisions contained ii* the same Act relating to the Appeals thereby authorized to be made against such Certificates, and the Costs thereof, shall extend and be applied to Appeals authorized by this Act, and the Costs thereof, except so far as the same are repugnant to the Provisions of this Act: Provided always, that no Order shall be made on any such Appeal, otherwise than for confirming the Composition stated in the Certificate, unless it shall be proved that some Fraud, Concealment, Misrepresentation, or Circumvention was practised by or on the Part of some Party interested in such Composition, whereby the Commissioner may have been deceived, or whereby the Knowledge of any Fact or Facts which was or were essential to enable the Commissioner to make a just Decision was withheld from him, and whereby the Amount of such Composition was unduly affected: Provided also, that when an Appeal from any Certificate of Composition has before the passing of this Act been decided upon the Merits by the Lord Lieutenant in Council, or by any Judge of Assize, no further Appeal relating thereto shall be made by virtue of this Act.

Lord Lieute- XV. And be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for any Person or Persons in any Parish nant may cause who would have been, in case this Act had not been made, individually or collectively liable beParaendwL 10 to Payment of more than One Fourth of the Amount of the whole Composition established in and for such Parish, whether the several Sums payable by him or them respectively shall be or may have been payable to any Party entitled to the Receipt of any Composition, or to any Landlord who may have taken upon him the Payment of such Composition, to apply to the said Lord Lieutenant in Council, praying the Amendment of the Applotment of any Composition, and such Application shall be made by Memorial, to be lodged at any Time before the First Day of October next with the said Clerk of the Council, and notified by public Advertisement and otherwise, in like Manner as Appeals against Certificates of Compositions; and if by any such Memorial it shall be made to appear to the Satisfaction of the said Lord Lieutenant in Council that any such Applotment of such Composition is defective or unjust, or does not with sufficient Precision ascertain the Lands and Holdings in respect whereof the said Rent-charges will be payable, it shall and may be lawful for the said Lord Lieutenant in Council to direct such Applotment to be amended, and for that Purpose to appoint some One or more skilful Person or Persons, who shall therein have and exercise the like Powers, Privileges, and Authorities, and observe the several Regulations in the said Acts for establishing Compositions of Tithes expressed and contained, but subject nevertheless to such Instructions and Directions as the said Lord Lieutenant in Council shall prescribe for the avoiding any Defect or Uncertainty to which the original Applotment may have been liable; and such amended Applotment shall be returned to the Clerk of the said Council, attested under the Hand of the Person or Persons making the same, and the original Book of Applotment shall be amended under the Direction of the said Lord Lieutenant in Council accordingly; and such amended Book of Applotment shall be in the Place and Stead of the said original Book of Applotment, and be valid and effectual to all Intents and Purposes for which the said original Book of Applotment would have been valid and effectual, but. in the meantime such original Book shall be in full Force Power to apply and Effect; and in every Case in which no Applotment shall hitherto have been made it anh A^jioug shall for any such Persons as are herein-before authorized to apply for the Amend-

ment where ment of any Applotment to apply for the making of such Applotment, in like Manner and none shall have within the like Period as is herein-before provided with respect to Memorials for the been ma e. Amendment of any Applotment; and in every such Case it shall and may be lawful for the said Lord Lieutenant in Council to appoint One or more skilful Persoir or Persons

467

1° & 2° VICTORIAE, c. 109.

to make such Applotment, who shall therein have and exercise the like Powers, Privileges, and Authorities, and observe as far as may be the like Regulations, as are given and directed to be observed by the said Acts for establishing Compositions of Tithes; and the said Lord Lieutenant shall cause to be paid to the Person or Persons employed for the Purposes aforesaid such Remuneration as he shall think reasonable, and the Expences thereof shall be repaid by Grand Jury Presentment, on or off the Parish in which such Expences shall have been incurred; and a Certificate of the Amount so expended in respect of each such Parish shall be transmitted under the Hand of one of the joint or assistant Secretaries of the Commissioners of the Treasury to the Treasurer of the County in which such Parish may be situate; and such Treasurer shall insert the Sum specified in such Certificate in his Warrant for the Collection of the Money to be raised and levied off such Parish by Presentment of the Grand Jury at the Assises next succeeding, and such Sum shall be applotted (if Need be by a separate Applotment) and raised and levied off the Lands liable to Rent-charge in such Parish in like Manner and by the like Ways and Means as if such Sum had been presented by the said Grand Jury at such Assizes to be levied off such Lands, and shall be paid over by the said Treasurer when and as by him received to such Bank or Person and in such Manner as the said Commissioners of the Treasury shall direct,

XVI. And forasmuch as the Rent-charges made payable by this Act are charged upon the Lands heretofore subject to the Payment of Compositions for Tithes, it is expedient to make Provisions for the more cheap and convenient Determination of the Liability to such Compositions; be it therefore enacted, That where any Person having any Interest in any Lands whereon any such Composition shall have been applotted shall dispute the Liability of such Lands thereto, by reason of such Land having been Tithe-free, or not rightfully charged with or otherwise not subject to such Tithe Compositions or the Applotment thereof, it shall be lawful for the Court of Chancery or Exchequer in Ireland^ upon the Petition of any such Person, in a summary Way to make such Order, allowing or disallowing such Claim of Exemption, or to direct such feigned Issue or Reference to any Master of the Court, or the Chief or Second Remembrancer, or other Proceeding as such Court shall think proper, for the Purpose of ascertaining whether such Lands would have been rightfully charged with Tithe Composition if this Act had not been made, or if such Composition had not been suspended; and if it shall appear to* the Court that such Land would not have been rightfully charged with such Composition, it shall be lawful for the said Court so to declare, and to make such Order for the Amendment of the Certificate and Applotment of such Composition, and of the Entry of such Certificate in the Registry of the Diocese, as to such Court may seem fit; and such Lands shall be exonerated from Rent-charge, or such Rent-charges reduced accordingly: Provided, that in any such Proceeding the Certificate or Applotment of any such Composition shall not be Evidence of the Liability of such Lands to such Composition, or the Applotment thereof.

XVII. And be it enacted, That where any Lands made subject to the Payment of any Part of a Composition (the Amount of such Composition not having been fixed by Agreement) shall, by virtue of any Decision in Law or Equity, have been or at any Time shall be declared to be exempt from the Payment of Tithes, it shall be lawful for the Court of Chancery or Exchequer in Ireland, upon the Petition of any Person liable to the Payment of Rent-charge in the Parish in which such Lands may be situate, to direct any Master of such Court, or the Chief or Second Remembrancer, to inquire into and ascertain, by Examination of the Commissioner or Commissioners, or Umpire, as the Case may be, by whom such Composition may have been established, or otherwise upon the best Evidence which can be procured, the Sum included in the Amount of such Composition on account of the Tithes of such Land, and the Certificate and Applotment of such Composition; and the Entry of such Certificate in the Registry of the Diocese shall be amended accordingly under the Direction of such Court, and the Rent-charges payable instead of such Composition for Tithes shall be reduced proportionably.

XVIII. And be it enacted, That all Prescriptions and Claim* of or for any Modus decimandi, or of or to any Exemption from or Discharge of Tithes, shall in all Cases

Court of Equity: Provided always, that such Party suing out Execution, and to whom any Proviso as to

dence of Sheriffs Sheriff Depute and Stewart Depute shall be and reside personally within his County, Shire, m their Coun- or Stewartry during the Space of Four Months at least in the Year, and also so much of the said Act as enacts a Penalty upon being convicted of not so residing, shall be and the same is hereby repealed; and that all Laws, Statutes, Acts of Sederunt, and Usages shall be and the same are hereby repealed in so far as they are inconsistent or at variance with the Provisions of this Act: Provided always, that the same shall be in force in all other respects whatsoever.

CAP. CXX.

An Act for the Abolition of the Duties payable on the Coinage of Tin in the Counties of Cornwall and Devon, and for giving Compensation in lieu of such Duties, and to reduce the Duties of Customs payable on Tin.

[16th August 1838.]

WHEREAS by the Laws, Usages, and Customs of the Counties of Cornwall and Devon, all Tin dug, raised, and taken therein respectively is required to be coined,

and certain Duties are payable for the Coinage thereof: And whereas by Charter made and passed in the Eleventh Year of the Reign of His Majesty King Edward the Third, and duly confirmed by Parliament, the said Coinage Duties, together with certain other Possessions, were thereby granted to the then Duke of Cornwall, and to the first-begotten Son 4 of him and his Heirs (Kings of England), being Dukes of Cornwall and Heirs Apparent to the Kingdom of England, and the same were thereby annexed and united to the Duchy of Cornwall for ever, to remain so that from the said Duchy they should at no Time be in anywise severed, so that when the Duke of Cornwall for the Time being should depart this Life, and a Son to whom the said Duchy was thereby appointed should not appear, the said Duchy should revert to and be retained in the Hands of the King of England for the Time being, until such Son, being Heir Apparent, should appear: And whereas such Duties on the Coinage of Tin in the said Counties of Cornwall and Devon are now payable to Her Majesty in right of Her Duchy of Cornwall: And whereas it is expedient and for the Benefit of Trade that it should not be necessary that any Tin so dug, raised, or taken should hereafter be coined, and that all Duties so as aforesaid payable on the Coinage thereof should cease, and that Compensation in lieu thereof should be given to Her Majesty or other the Personage for the Time being entitled to the Revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the Tenth Day of October next ensuing the passing of this Act it shall not be necessary to coin any Tin dug, raised, or taken in the said Counties of Cornwall and Devon, or in either of them, and that the Duties which would but for this Act be payable on the Coinage of Tin after that Time shall cease and determine.

II. And be it enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury and they are hereby required to ascertain the Amount of the clear annual Payments during the last Ten Years in respect of such Coinage Duties in the said Counties of Devon and Cornwall, after deducting therefrom all Costs, Charges, and Expences to Officers and others during such Period incurred in and incident to the ascertaining, managing, and collecting of such Coinage Duties.

III. And be it enacted, That in lieu of such Coinage Duties an Annuity or yearly Sum equal to the Amount which shall be so ascertained to have been the Average of such Payments shall be issued out of and charged and chargeable upon the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (after paying or reserving sufficient to pay all such Sum and Sums of Money as have been directed by any former Act or Acts of Parliament to be paid out of the same, but with Preference to all other Payments which shall or may hereafter be charged upon or payable out of the said Fund), and be payable, free and clear from all Deductions and Taxes whatsoever, quarterly on the Fifth Day of January, the Fifth Day of April, the Fifth Day of July, and the Tenth Day of October in every Year, by equal Portions, and be accordingly paid to Her Majesty and other the Personage for the Time being entitled to the Revenues of the said Duchy of Cornwall

IV. And be it enacted, That the Acquittances or Acquittance, Receipts or Receipt, of the Receiver General for the Time being of the said Duchy of Cornwall, shall be a good and sufficient Discharge for the Payment of the said Annuity.

1° & 2° VICTORIAE, c. 120.

V. And be it enacted, and it is hereby declared to be the true Intent and Meaning hereof, That Her Majesty and other the Personage for the Time being entitled to the Revenues of the said Duchy of Cornwall shall have such and the like, and no larger or other, Estate or Title, or Power of Disposition or Alienation, or Interest, of and in the said Annuity, as Her Majesty or other the Personage for the Time being entitled to the Revenues of the said Duchy of Cornwall would have had in the said Coinage Duties, and that the said Annuity shall from Time to Time belong to Her Majesty, and such other Personage as would have been entitled to the said Coinage Duties in case this Act had not been passed

VI. And whereas it is only just and reasonable that Provision should be made for granting Compensation upon equitable Principles to such Officers and others as have here-

tofore been employed in the ascertaining, managing, and collecting such Coinage Duties,

and in relation thereto, and whose Emoluments will be affected hereby; be it enacted, That the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury shall ascertain, by such Ways and Means as to them shall seem proper, the net annual Receipts of each and every of such Officers and others whose Emoluments shall be affected by the Operation of this Act, and shall grant such Compensation to all such Parties, either by One Payment in gross, or by an annual Amount payable quarterly, as, having regard to the Tenure of their several Offices and Employments, and to the Duration of their Service, shall appear to the said Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to be just and proper: Provided always, that all such Compensations shall be payable and paid out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

VII. And be it enacted, That a Return of the Amount of the Compensation ascertained to be due and payable on account of the Repeal of the said Coinage Duties on Tin, together with a Statement of all such Compensations as shall be granted to the Officers and others whose Emoluments shall be affected by the Operation of this Act, and also a Return of the gross annual Payments during each of the said Ten Years in respect of such Coinage Duties, and also a Return of all the Costs, Charges, and Expences to Officers and others during such Period, incurred in and incident to the ascertaining, managing, and collecting of such Coinage Duties, shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within Thirty Days after the Commencement of the next Session of Parliament.

VIII. And be it enacted, That instead of the Duties of Customs now payable on Tin and on Tin Ore the following Duties shall be raised, levied, collected, and paid unto Her Majesty, in like Manner as if such Duties had been imposed by an Act passed in the Third and Fourth Years of the Reign of His late Majesty King William the Fourth, intituled An Act for granting Duties of Customs; (that is to say,)

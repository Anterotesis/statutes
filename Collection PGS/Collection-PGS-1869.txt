[19th April 1869.]

WHEREAS it is judged necessary for the safety of the United Kingdom, and the defence of the possessions of this realm, that a body of Royal Marine forces should be employed in Her Majesty's fleet and naval service, under the direction of the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom, or the commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid: And whereas the said forces may frequently be quartered or be on shore, or sent to do duty or be on board transport ships or merchant ships or vessels, or ships or vessels of Her Majesty, or other ships or vessels, or they may be under other circumstances in which they will not be subject to the laws relating to the government of Her Majesty's forces by sea: And whereas no man can be forejudged of life or limb, or subjected in time of peace to any kind of punishment within this realm, by martial law, or in any other manner than by the judgment of his peers, and according to the known and established laws of this realm; yet nevertheless it being requisite for the retaining of such forces in their duty that an exact discipline be observed, and that marines who shall mutiny or stir up sedition, or shall desert Her Majesty's service, or be guilty of any other crime or offence in breach of or to the prejudice of good order and discipline, be brought to a more exemplary and speedy punishment than the usual forms of the law will allow:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's mast Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: 1. It shall be lawful for the said Lord High Admiral, or the commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid, from time to time to make, ordain, alter, and establish rules and articles of war, under the hand of the said Lord High Admiral, or under the hands of any two or more of the said commissioners, for the better government of Her Majesty's Royal Marine forces, and for the punishment of mutiny, desertion, immorality, breach of discipline, misbehaviour, neglect of duty, and any other offence or misconduct of which they shall be guilty, in any place on shore or afloat in or out of Her Majesty's dominions, or at any time when or under any circumstances in which they shall not be amenable to the laws for the government of Her Majesty's ships, vessels, and forces by sea, and for regulating the proceedings of courts-martial, which rules and articles shall be judicially taken notice of by all judges and in all courts whatsoever; and copies of the same shall, as soon as conveniently may be after the same shall have been made, be transmitted by the secretary of the

1869. Marine Mutiny. Ch. 5. 6.9

Admiralty for the time being (certified under his hand) to the judges of Her Majesty's superior courts at Westminster,

CHAP. 7.

An Act for the confirmation and execution of arrangements made between the Secretary of State in Council of India and the East India Irrigation and Canal Company; and for other purposes connected therewith.

[19th April 1869.]

WHEREAS the East India Irrigation and Canal Company (in this Act and the schedule thereto called the company) were by the East India Irrigation and Canal Act, 1861, incorporated for the purposes therein mentioned, including the following; namely, —

The construction, improvement, maintenance, and management of works for the irrigation of land, combined, wherever such combination might be considered practicable and advantageous, with navigable canals, and of navigable canals, within the dominions of Her Majesty the Queen known as the East Indies, or in any of the adjacent states and territories:

The rendering navigable and improving the navigation of rivers or waters within such dominions, states, and territories:

The construction, improvement, maintenance, and management of works for the supply of water, and the supply of water to the Secretary of State in Council of India or the supreme or any of the local governments of India, or to any body or person:

1869. East India Irrigation and Canal Company. Ch. 7.

The obtaining of all powers, the entering into all contracts! and the doing of all things expedient for or incidental, necessary, or conducive to the attainment of those purposes or any or either of them, either by the company alone, or jointly with any other company, or in conjunction with the Secretary of State in Council, or the supreme or any of the local or native governments of India, or any other body or person; with a proviso that only such of the purposes aforesaid should be carried into operation as should be agreed on between the company and the Secretary of State in Council, or the supreme or any of the local governments of India:

And whereas by agreement with the Secretary of State in Council the company undertook the execution of a scheme of works for irrigation, navigation, and supply of water and other purposes in the districts and deltas of the rivers Maha-nuddy, Byturny, and Brahmany, in the province of Orissa, and their affluents, and a main irrigation and navigable canal to connect those works with Calcutta, with subsidiary channels necessary to irrigate and accommodate with means of water transport the lands of the districts through which the main canal would pass, which scheme of works is known as the Orissa undertaking:

And whereas by The East India Irrigation and Canal Act, 1866, provision was made to the effect that the Orissa undertaking should be deemed a separate undertaking of the company, and that the capital then already issued by the company should be appropriated for the purposes of that undertaking, and, with all further capital which the company might thereafter issue for that undertaking, should be called the Orissa capital, and should be kept separate and distinct from the other capital of the company, and that the income to be derived from the outlay of that capital should be kept separate and distinct from the other income of the company:

And whereas by another agreement with the Secretary of State in Council the company undertook the execution of a scheme of works (similar in character to those of the Orissa undertaking) in the province of Behar, starting from the Soane river, and embracing territory between that river and Chunar on the one side, and Patna on the other side, which scheme of works is known as the Behar undertaking, but no capital has been created in respect of that undertaking:

And whereas it having appeared to the Secretary of State in Council and to the company expedient that the company should transfer to the Secretary of State in Council the Orissa undertaking and the Behar undertaking, and all the rights and interests of the company therein respectively, agreements for such transfer have been made on the terms appearing in the three instruments described in the schedule to this Act, and those instruments purport to carry into effect or to provide for such transfer; but doubts have been raised whether

the company had power to enter into the said agreements, and it is expedient that provision be made by authority of Parliament for the execution thereof:

May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as The East India Irrigation and Canal Act, 1869.

2.

4* The directors of the company shall hold all principal money by the first-mentioned of the scheduled instruments stipulated to be paid to them for and on behalf of the shareholders in the Orissa undertaking by the Secretary of State in Council, when the same is received by them, and all interest received by them in respect thereof from the Secretary of State in Council, on trust to distribute the same among the holders of shares or stock in the Orissa capital, their executors, administrators, or assigns, rateably according to the amounts paid on or in respect of their shares or stock.

5. The persons who appear in the books of the company to be proprietors of shares or stock in the Orissa capital shall, unless the contrary is proved to the satisfaction of the directors of the company, be considered to be holders of shares or stock in the Orissa capital for the purposes of the distribution of money in pursuance of this Act; and where any share in the Orissa capital has been declared forfeited by the company, but has not been sold, the same shall for the purposes of the scheduled instruments, but not further or otherwise, be deemed to have reverted as on the twenty-seventh day of November one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight to the person to whom the same belonged at the time of forfeiture.

6. The receipt of an executor or administrator of a deceased holder of any share or stock in the OriBsa capital, and the

7. On receipt by the several holders of shares or stock in the Orissa capital of their respective proportions of the money distributable among them under the scheduled instruments or any of them, those several shareholders or stockholders (except such of them as are for the time being acting as members of a committee for executing any resolution passed by the company before the passing of this Act under or in contemplation of the scheduled instruments or any of them) shall aespectively cease to be members of the company as holders of such shares or stock, and the shares or stock held by them shall be deemed to be extinguished, and the Orissa capital shall be reduced accordingly; and as soon as all money received by the directors of the company in respect of the Orissa undertaking under the scheduled instruments or any of them has been distributed in manner directed by the scheduled instruments or any of them or by this Act, and the affairs of the Orissa undertaking have been wound up, then by virtue of this Act the Orissa undertaking shall cease to be part of the undertaking of the company, and the Orissa capital shall cease to exist, and the holders of shares or stock therein, excepted as aforesaid, shall cease to be as such members of the company, and as from the passing of this Act so much of the nominal Orissa capital as is not subscribed for shall be deemed to be extinguished.

departed out of England, or being out of England remained out of England; or being a trader departed from his dwelling house, or otherwise absented himself; or begun to keep house; or suffered himself to be outlawed:

(4.) That the debtor has filed in the prescribed manner in the Court a declaration admitting his inability to pay his debts:

(5.) That execution issued against the debtor on any legal process for the purpose of obtaining payment of not less than fifty pounds has in the case of a trader been levied by seizure and sale of his goods:

(6.) That the creditor presenting the petition has served in the prescribed manner on the debtor a debtor's summons requiring the debtor to pay a sum due, of an amount of not less than fifty pounds, and the debtor being a trader has for the space of seven days, or not being a trader has for the space of three weeks succeeding the service of such summons, neglected to pay such sum, or to secure or compound for the same.

But no person shall be adjudged a bankrupt on any of the above grounds unless the act of bankruptcy on which the adjudication is grounded has occurred within six months before the presentation of the petition for adjudication; moreover, the debt of the petitioning creditor must be a liquidated sum due at law or in equity, and must not be a secured debt, unless the petitioner state in his petition that he will be ready to give up such security for the benefit of the creditors in the event of the debtor being adjudicated a bankrupt, or unless the petitioner is willing to give an estimate of the value of his security, in which latter case he may be admitted as a petitioning creditor to the extent of the balance of the debt due to him after deducting the value so estimated, but he shall, on an application being made by the trustee within the prescribed time after the date of adjudication, give up his security to such trustee for the benefit of the creditors upon payment of such estimated value.

7. A debtor's summons may be granted by the court on a creditor proving to its satisfaction that a debt sufficient to support a petition in bankruptcy is due to him from the person against whom the summons is sought, and that the creditor has failed to obtain payment of his debt, after using reasonable efforts to do so. The summons shall be in the prescribed form, resembling, as nearly as circumstances admit, a writ issued by one of Her Majesty's superior courts. It shall state that in the event of the debtor failing to pay the sum specified in the summons, or to compound for the same to the satisfaction of the creditor, a petition may be presented against him, praying that he may be adjudged a bankrupt. The summons shall have an endorsement thereon to the like

1869. Bankruptcy* Ch. 71.

effect, or such other prescribed endorsement as may be best calculated to indicate to the debtor the nature of the document served upon him, and the consequences of inattention to the requisitions therein made.

Any debtor served with a debtor's summons may apply to the court, in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time, to dismiss such summons, on the ground that he is not indebted to the creditor serving such summons, or that he is not indebted to such amount as will justify such creditor in presenting a bankruptcy petition against him; and the court may dismiss the summons, with or without costs, if satisfied with the allegations made by the debtor, or it may, upon such security (if any) being given as the court may require for payment to the creditor of the debt alleged by him to be due, and the costs of establishing such debt, stay all proceedings on the summons for such time as will be required for the trial of the question relating to such debt: Provided that when the summons shall have issued from the London Court of Bankruptcy, such trial shall be had either before such Court or before any other Court of competent jurisdiction, and when the summons shall have issued from a county court, before such court in all cases in which it has now jurisdiction, and in all other cases before some competent tribunal

8. A petition praying that a debtor may be adjudged a bankrupt, in this Act referred to as a bankruptcy petition, shall be served in the prescribed manner. At the hearing the Court shall require proof of the debt of the petitioning creditor, and of the trading, if necessary, and of the act of bankruptcy, or, if more than one act of bankruptcy is alleged in the petition, of some one of the alleged acts of bankruptcy, and, if satisfied with such proof, shall adjudge the debtor to be bankrupt. The Court may adjourn the petition, either conditionally or unconditionally, for the procurement of further evidence, or for any other just cause, or may dismiss the petition, with or without costs, as the Court thinks just.

9. Where the debtor appears on the petition, and denies that he is indebted to the petitioner, or that he is indebted to such amount as would justify the petitioner in presenting a bankruptcy petition against him, the Court, upon such security (if any) being given as the Court may require, for payment to the petitioner of any debt which may be established against him in due course of law, and of the costs of establishing such debt, may stay all proceedings on the petition for such time as may be required for trial of the question relating to such debt, and such trial shall be had in manner herein-before provided with respect to disputed debts under debtors summonses.

Where proceedings are stayed the Court may, if by reason of the delay caused by such stay of proceedings or for any other cause it thinks just, adjudge the debtor a bankrupt on

The bankruptcy of a debtor shall be deemed to have relation back to and to commence at the time of the act of bankruptcy being completed on which the order is made adjudging him to be bankrupt; or if the bankrupt is proved to have committed more acts of bankruptcy than one, to have relation back to and to commence at the time of the first of the acts of bankruptcy that may be proved to have been committed by the bankrupt within twelve months next preceding the order of adjudication; but the bankruptcy shall not relate to any prior act of bankruptcy, unless it be that at the time of committing such prior act the bankrupt was indebted to some creditor or creditors in a sum or sums sufficient to support a petition in bankruptcy, and unless such debt or debts are still remaining due at the time of the adjudication.

12. Where a debtor shall be adjudicated a bankrupt, no creditor to whom the bankrupt is indebted in respect of any debt provable in the bankruptcy shall have any remedy against the property or person of the bankrupt in respect of such debt except in manner directed by this Act But this section shall not affect the power of any creditor holding a security upon the property of the bankrupt to realize or otherwise deal with such security in the same manner as he would have been entitled to realize or deal with the same if this section had not been passed.

13. The Court may, at any time after the presentation of a bankruptcy petition against the debtor, restrain further proceedings in any action, suit, execution, or other legal process against the debtor in respect of any debt provable in bankruptcy, or it may allow such proceedings, whether in progress at the commencement of the bankruptcy or commenced during its continuance, to proceed upon such terms as the Court may think just. The Court may also, at any time after the presentation of such petition, appoint a receiver or manager of the property or business of the debtor against whom the petition is presented, or of any part thereof and may direct immediate possession to be taken of such property or business, or any part thereof.

The creditors assembled at the meeting may express their opinion as to the conduct of the trustee, and they, or any of them, may appear before the Court and oppose the release of the trustee.

The Court, after hearing what, if anything, can be urged against the release of the trustee, shall grant or withhold the release accordingly, and if it withhold the release shall make such order as it thinks just, charging the trustee with the consequences of any act or default he may have done or made contrary to his duty, and shall suspend his release until such charging order has been complied with, and the Court thinks just to grant the release of the trustee.

52. Unclaimed dividends, and any other monies arising from the property of the bankrupt, remaining under the control of the trustee at the close of the bankruptcy of any bankrupt, or accruing thereafter, shall be accounted and paid over to such account as may be directed by the rules of Court to be made with the sanction of the Treasury; and any parties entitled thereto may claim the same in manner directed by such rules. The trustee shall also deliver a list of any outstanding property of the bankrupt to the prescribed persons, and the same shall, when practicable, be got in and applied for the benefit of the creditors in manner prescribed.

Ch. 71. Bankruptcy. 32 & 33 Vict *

In calculating a majority for the purposes of a composition under this section, creditors whose debts amount to sums not exceeding ten pounds shall be reckoned in the majority in value, but not in the majority in number, and the value of the debts of secured creditors shall, as nearly as circumstances admit, be estimated in the same way, and the same description of creditors shall be entitled to vote at such general meetings as in bankruptcy.

The extraordinary resolution, together with the statement of the debtor as to his assets and debts, shall be presented to the registrar, and it shall be his duty to inquire whether such resolution has been passed in manner directed by this section, and if satisfied that it has been so passed he shall forthwith register the resolution and statement of assets and debts, but until such registration has taken place such resolution shall be of no validity; and any creditor of the debtor may inspect such statement at prescribed times, and on payment of such fee, if any, as may be prescribed.

The creditors may, by an extraordinary resolution, add to or vary the provisions of any composition previously accepted by them, without prejudice to any persons taking interests under such provisions who do not assent to such addition or variation; and any such extraordinary resolution shall be presented to the registrar in the same manner and with the same consequences as the extraordinary resolution by which the composition was accepted in the first instance.

Rules of Court may be made in relation to proceedings on the occasion of the acceptance of a composition by an extraordinary resolution of creditors in the same manner and to the same extent and of the same authority as in respect of proceedings in bankruptcy.

127. The registration by the registrar of a special resolution of the creditors on the occasion of a liquidation by arrangement under Part Six of this Act, or of an extraordinary resolution of the creditors on the occasion of a composition under the Seventh Part of this Act, shall, in the absence of fraud, be conclusive evidence that such resolutions respectively were duly passed and all the requisitions of this Act in respect of such resolutions complied with.

An Act to amend " The Drainage and Improvement of Lands (Ireland) Act, 1863," and to afford further facilities for the purposes thereof.

[9th August 1869.]

WHEREAS an Act passed in the session of Parliament 26 & 27 Vict. holden in the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh years of c. 88.

Her Majesty, chapter eighty-eight, intituled "An Act to enable " landed proprietors to construct works for Drainage and " Improvement of Lands in Ireland

And whereas a further Act was passed in the session holden 27 & 23 Vict. in the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth years of Her Majesty, c- 72 chapter seventy-two, explaining certain provisions contained in the said Act:

And whereas a further Act was passed in the session of 2s & 29 Vict. Parliament holden in the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth c- 52-years of Her Majesty, chapter fifty-two, intituled "An Act to " amend the Drainage and Improvement of Lands Acts " (Ireland), and to afford further facilities for the purposes " thereof:"

And whereas by the thirty-sixth section of the first of the said Acts it was provided that the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland might make advances of public monies for the purpose of aiding in the completion of the drainage or improvement of works in any district; and by the thirty-eighth section of the same Act it was provided that no issue or instalment of any such loan or advance should be made unless the said commissioners should be satisfied that the drainage board had previously bon& fide expended a sum of money equal to the amount of such issue or instalment in the drainage or improvement of such district, nor in any case should any such loan or advance be made exceeding one moiety of the monies proposed to be expended on the drainage and improvement of such district:

And by the thirty-ninth and the six next following sections of the said Act provision is made for the making by the same commissioners of a certain award therein called " the apportionment of expenses award," and for giving effect to the terms of such award:

And by the forty-sixth and five next following sections of the same Act provision is made for the making by the same commissioners of a certain other award to be called "the repayment of public advances award," and for giving effect to the terms of such last-mentioned award, and for the pur-

CR.*Z2.Ihxiinage) Jkc.ofLands (I.) Act (1863) Arndt. 32 & 33 Vict.

pose of securing the repayment of any advances of public monies made in the manner so herein above referred to; and it is thereby provided that the said last-mentioned award shall specify the principal monies so advanced by the said commissioners, with interest thereon at the rate of four pounds per centum per annum, from the respective dates of such advances to the date of such award, and that such consolidated sum of principal and interest should be thereby apportioned amongst the respective proprietors in such districts, and on their lands respectively, and that the several lands mentioned in any such award should from the date thereof be charged with the payment to Her Majesty of an annual rentcharge of six pounds ten shillings for every one hundred pounds charged on such lands, to be payable for the term of twenty-two years to be computed from the fifth day of April or tenth day of October, which should next happen after the date of such award, to be paid by equal half-yearly payments on the said fifth day of April and tenth day of October in every year, the first of such payments to be made on the second of such days which should happen after the date of such award:

And whereas by the " Drainage and Improvement of Lands Amendment Act (Ireland), 1865," aforesaid so much of the said thirty-eighth section of the said first-recited Act as limited or restricted the amount of public monies to be advanced as aforesaid was repealed, and the said Commissioners of Public Works were thereby empowered (with the sanction of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury), by such instalments and subject to such rules and regulations as the said last-mentioned commissioners might think proper to advance, any sum or sums of money wrhich the said Commissioners of Public Works might think necessary and proper for execution of the works in any district, and for defraying the expenses which the said commissioners might consider properly connected therewith; provided that no second or subsequent instalment of any such loan should be made until it should have been proved to the satisfaction of the said Commissioners of Public Works that the preceding instalment had been properly expended in the execution of the works in such district:

And whereas in certain cases in which districts have been constituted, and have been drained and improved under the provisions of the said Acts, the whole of the monies expended on such drainage and improvement of works have consisted of public monies advanced by the said Commissioners of Public Works under the provisions of the same Acts, and it is anticipated that in other instances in which works for the drainage and improvement of other districts may be hereafter carried on in pursuance of the provisions of the same Acts the whole of the monies required for such works may in like manner be advanced by the said commissioners:

447

1869. Drainage, cfee. of Lands (/.) Ad (1863) Araeft. Ch. 72.

And whereas it would be more convenient if, in all cases where the monies so expended on drainage or improvement of any district have consisted or shall consist of public monies, one award only shall be made, in which should be combined the several particulars required to be specified in the said two awards respectively as aforesaid:

And whereas in order to prevent the accumulation of interest chargeable in respect of the public advances aforesaid, it is expedient to alter and amend the provisions aforesaid, with respect to the period up to which interest on such public advances is directed to be calculated, and from which such rentcharge is directed to commence in the manner herein-after contained:

And whereas by the seventy-second and the three next following sections of the same Act provision is made in certain cases for taking down, altering, removing, and rebuilding any existing bridge, culvert, or archway for the discharge of water under any public road, and for certain other works in relation thereto:

And it is by the said section seventy-three provided that it shall be lawful for the said Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland to issue a certificate under their seal declaring the amount which the county within which such works shall be situate ought to contribute towards the expenses so incurred by the drainage board therein mentioned, and that such certificate shall be laid before the grand jury of the said county at the assizes next after the issuing of the same, and the grand jury of the said county is thereby authorized and required without any application to presentment sessions to present the amount mentioned in such certificate to be levied off the county at large, by such sums and at such times as shall be mentioned in such certificate, and to be paid to the said drainage board, and the same provision is also thereby made applicable where any such new bridge, culvert, or archway shall be over any stream or river forming a boundary between two counties, and provision is also made for levying such sums by order of the court, in case any grand jury should refuse to make any such presentment:

And it would be more equitable in some cases if such expenses so incurred as aforesaid were charged upon a particular barony or particular baronies or half baronies of a county or counties, and not upon such county or counties at large; and it is expedient to make provision accordingly, and it would be more convenient if the monies to be paid by any county or counties, barony or baronies, half barony or half baronies as aforesaid, should in all cases when as aforesaid the whole or any part of the monies required for such works shall have been or shall hereafter be advanced out of the public monies, be paid to the said Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland:

And whereas, in order to protect the public revenue, it is expedient that similar powers to those conferred upon the Postmaster General with respect to the exclusive privilege of conveying letters should be enacted with reference to the transmission of public telegraphic messages within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; and that the said Act should be amended in other respects:

And whereas agreements have been entered into by or on behalf of the said Postmaster General for the acquisition of the undertakings of the several telegraph companies enumerated in the schedule to this Act, on payment to such companies respectively of the amounts set forth in such schedule, amounting in the whole to the sum of five millions seven hundred and fifteen thousand and forty-eight pounds eight shillings and eleven pence:

And whereas in further pursuance of the said Telegraph Act, 1868, the Postmaster General has entered into arrangements with divers railway companies, and negotiations are now pending between him and other railway companies as to their interest in telegraphic business, and it is estimated that the amount which will be required for the purchase by the Postmaster General on behalf of Her Majesty of the interest of such railway companies in telegraphic business will not exceed the sum of seven hundred thousand pounds:

7. Where a bankrupt has before adjudication of bankruptcy taken the benefit of any Act for the relief of insolvent debtors, nothing in The Bankruptcy Act, 1869, shall interfere with the operation of the Act of which he so took the benefit, in respect of the liability of property acquired after his discharge under that Act, if and so far as any such liability would have existed if The Bankruptcy Act, 1869, had not been passed.

8. The person at the passing of this Act holding the office of provisional and official assignee of the estates and effects of insolvent debtors shall be deemed to have been duly appointed, and shall (subject to the provisions of this Act) continue, on the same terms on which he then holds that office, to perform the duties imposed on him by or under The Bankruptcy Act, 1861, or any other Act. If a vacancy occurs in that office at any time after the passing of this Act, the Lord Chancellor may appoint a fit person to perform the remaining duties thereof, who shall receive such remuneration as the Lord Chancellor, with the concurrence of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, from time to time directs, and the person so appointed shall have all the powers and authorities of the person who is at the passing of this Act the provisional and official assignee; and all estates, rights, and effects vested at the time of the vacancy in the provisional and official assignee shall, by virtue of such appointment, become vested in the person so appointed, and the like appointment on a vacancy shall be made and the like vesting shall have effect from time to time as occasion requires.

9. The provisional and official assignee of the estates and effects of insolvent debtors and the person for the time being appointed to perform the remaining duties of that office shall also be styled the Receiver of the late Insolvent Debtors Court, and as such he shall act in such manner in relation to the receipt and custody of money paid to him or into court in respect of the estates of insolvent debtors, and to the payment thereof out of court, and give such security, as may be from time to time prescribed by the rules of court.

The accounts of the provisional and official assignee and receiver may be audited by such person and in such manner and at such times as may be prescribed by the rules of court.

10. The taxing master, clerks, and persons (other than the provisional and official assignee) at the commencement of this Act discharging duties connected with the late Insolvent Debtors Court shall continue to discharge the same duties as at the commencement of this Act; and every such clerk and person appointed before the commencement of The Bankruptcy Act, 1861, shall hold his appointment during good behaviour, but may be removed by the Lord Chancellor, by order, for some sufficient reason therein stated. If a vacancy happens in the place of any clerk or person to whom this section relates, the Lord Chancellor may, if he thinks fit, with the concurrence of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, employ a fit

12. The clerks and persons (other than the provisional and official assignee) who under this Act discharge duties connected with the late Insolvent Debtors Court shall as long as they discharge such duties continue to receive the same salaries as at the commencement of this Act.

14. For the purpose of winding up and terminating as quickly as possible all matters at the commencement of this Act pending in the late Insolvent Debtors Court and in county courts under the Acts for the relief of insolvent debtors, the judges of the courts in which the same are pending shall from time to time order the provisional and official assignee of the estates and effects of insolvent debtors, or the person for the time being appointed to perform the remaining duties of that office, to institute and carry on such proceedings, either at law or in equity, as the judges direct for compelling creditors, assignees, and others to account for and pay to the receiver of the late Insolvent Debtors Court assets belonging to the estates of insolvent debtors, and those judges shall have for that purpose all such powers and authorities as were vested in the late Insolvent Debtors Court in cases where the court was dis-satisfied with the account of an assignee.

(3.) If the close is postponed the same proceedings may be had before the expiration of the period of postponement as is provided by this section before the expiration of the said twenty years:

(4) If sufficient cause for postponement is not shown before the expiration of the said twelve months, or twenty years, or the period of postponement (as the case may be) or of such further period as may, subject to the rules of court, be allowed for an application by the court in which the case is pending, the insolvency shall at the expiration of the said times be ipso facto closed, and thereupon the insolvent or the hell's, devisees, or personal representatives of the insolvent (if he is dead) shall be in the same position and have the same rights in all respects as if the insolvent had been bankrupt, and had at the date of the closing obtained his discharge under The Bankruptcy Act,

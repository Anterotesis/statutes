General Board of Health, confirmed by " The Public Health Supplemental Act, 1851," (No. 3,) have, in pursuance of the provisions of the 75 th section of the Local Government Act, 1858, and after complying with the requirements of that section by duly giving and serving all notices thereby directed, presented a Petition, under the seal of the said Local Board, to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State for authority to put in force the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, to enable the aforesaid Local Board of Health to purchase certain pieces of land and certain buildings for the purpose of widening, opening, enlarging, and improving certain streets and highways in the said Borough, such land and buildings being all situate within the District of the said Local Board of Health:

And whereas the said Petition duly set forth in the Schedule annexed thereto the several pieces of land and the several buildings intended to be taken by such Board for such purpose, and the names of the owners, lessees, and occupiers of the aforesaid land and buildings who have assented, dissented, and are neuter in respect of the taking thereof, or who have returned no answer to the notice issued by such Board; and such petition prayed that the said Board might, with reference to such lands and buildings, be allowed to put in force the powers of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act aforesaid with respect to the purchase and taking of land otherwise than by agreement; and on the receipt of such petition Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department directed Arnold Taylor, Esquire, the Inspector appointed for the purpose, to visit the said district, and the said Inspector has now inquired, in the district aforesaid, into the subject matter of such Petition, and has duly reported thereon:

Now, therefore, I, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do hereby in pursuance of the powers vested in me by the Local Government Act, 1858, make order and direct, —

That from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this Order,

1.

And whereas the Limerick Harbour Commissioners have applied for an Act (the Short Title of which is The Limerick 30 & 31 Vict. 4 Harbour Act, 1867/') to authorize them to levy certain Tolls, c- clvHarbour Rates, and Duties in lieu of the Tolls, Rates, and Duties heretofore authorized, so as to provide sufficient Means 4 (after Charges for Maintenance, as herein-after mentioned,)

ProvidioTial Order for the Alteration of the Town of Burton-upon-Trent Act, 1853, in force within the District of the Burton-upor^Trent Local Board.

Whereas the Commissioners acting in execution of a certain Local Act of Parliament passed in the sixteenth and seventeenth years of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria (cap. 118.), intituled " An Act for more effectually improving " the Town of Burton-upon-Trent in the County of Stafford," have duly adopted the Local Government Act, 1858, in and for the said Town of Burton-upon-Trent and the District thereof; and whereas parts of the said Local Act have been repealed by a Provisional Order, dated the 28 th day of February 1866, confirmed by " The Local Government Supplemental Act, 1866

And whereas the said Commissioners acting as a Local Board, under and for the purposes of the said Local Government Act, have now, in pursuance of the said Act, presented a Petition to me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, praying for a further partial repeal of the said Local [No. 58.

Act (being an Act in force within the said District having relation to the purposes of the Local Government Act, and not conferring powers or privileges upon any corporation, company, undertakers, or individuals for their own pecuniary benefit), and for other purposes in such Petition set forth:

And whereas it appears, after consideration of the said Petition, to be expedient to issue a Provisional Order in relation to the said matters, but no such Order can be valid without the confirmation of Parliament:

Now, therefore, I, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, and in pursuance of the powers vested in me by the Local Government Act, 1858, do, by this Provisional Order under my hand, direct, —

That from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this Order —

The purposes of the unrepealed parts of the Local Act shall be deemed to be purposes of the Local Government Acts aforesaid so far as concerns any provisions whatsoever locally in operation of the same Acts; and in like manner the purposes of the said Local Government Acts, so far as operative, shall be deemed to be purposes of the Local Act so far as concerns the unrepealed parts thereof; and references to rates, to penalties, to damages, to expenses, and other matters contained in the Local Act, and in the portions incorporated of the Commissioners Clauses Act, 1847, and Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847, shall be construed to mean rates leviable, penalties recoverable, damages and expenses ascertainable and recoverable, and corresponding matters under the Local Government Acts, the said Acts being construed together.

3. — All expenses incurred or to be incurred under the unrepealed parts of the said Local Act or the provisions in operation either heretofore or hereunder of the Local Government Acts or any of them, whether for sewers and for outfall works and reservoir and works for flushing sewers and for drains and for private improvements or other purposes whatsoever,

shall be borne by the rates and charges leviable in the District or any part thereof under the Local Government Acts aforesaid, or by monies borrowed on such rates or charges according to the regulations of the same Acts, as if the purposes for which such expenses have been or shall be incurred were purposes of such Local Government Acts.

4. — The General District Bate, according to the said Local

Government Acts, shall be levied by the Commissioners for the satisfaction of undischarged debts and expenses of the Commissioners (including mortgage debts), as well those due on or payable out of the Town Rate or other general rate over the District as those due on or payable out of any Special District Bate extending over the same area, and such undischarged debts and expenses may be paid either by such General District Bate or by monies borrowed on such rate.

5. — The receipt of the Commissioners or their Treasurer, or

any other person appointed by them to receive the same, for all monies to be borrowed shall be an effectual discharge for the same; and the persons or person advancing or lending the same shall not be bound or concerned -on any account to see to the application thereof or any part thereof, nor be responsible for any misapplication.

Act above mentioned, all rates, contracts, debts, liabilities, securities, appointments, and retainers of officers and servants, law proceedings, byelaws, regulations, and other matters and things already made, done, given, entered into, executed, or instituted by or against the Commissioners under the Local Act or the provisions heretofore in operation of the Local Government Acts, or with reference to the purposes of the same respectively, shall be proceeded and dealt with, paid, maintained, and enforced (subject to the modification as to rates and charges aforesaid) under the Local Act and parts in operation of the Local Government Acts as if the same arose thereunder.

7. — This Order shall be without prejudice to the powers and

provisions of the Local Act relating to gasworks and supply, to markets and tolls, and to police, and to coke, which shall all have the same relation to the altered law as they bore to the original.

WEST COWES.

Provisional Order altering a Local Act in force in the District of West Cowes.

Whereas a Petition under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1858, has been duly presented to me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, from the Local Board of Health for the District of West Cowes in the Isle of Wight, praying for an alteration of a certain Local Act of 56 George 3. cap. 25., intituled " An Act for paving, lighting, " cleansing, and otherwise improving the town of West Cowes " in the Isle of Wight in the county of Southampton, and for " establishing a market within the said town

And whereas it is by section 13 of the said Act enacted:

" That it shall be lawful for the said Commissioners to add " to the wharf or landing-place situate opposite the place called " Feathers Hill within the said town, and to extend the same " eastward, or in such other direction as may be thought " proper, into Cowes Harbour, so far as to enable vessels to u lay alongside, and to land and ship goods and passengers " thereon and therefrom, and of such width as may be necessary " for that purpose, and to erect, build, and set up such cranes " and other machinery as they the said Commissioners shall " think necessary and proper for the landing and shipping " of passengers, goods, wares, and merchandises, and from " time to time to repair, amend, and keep in repair the said " quays, wharfs, landing-places, and other works, by and out " of the rates and assessments to be raised and collected by " virtue of this Act; and it shall be lawful for the said Com-lt missioners from time to time to demand, accept, receive, " take, and recover of and from all and every passenger and " passengers and other person who shall land on the said " Janding-place, quays, wharfs, or other works, or embark or u go on board any vessel, boat, wherry, or other machine u whatsoever from the said landing-place, quays, wharfs, and " works, or any of them, and for all and every cattle, stock, " goods, wares, and merchandises, and other matters and lc things whatsoever, that shall or may be landed, unladen,

" shipped, laden, unshipped, or otherwise taken from or placed " on the said landing-place, quays, wharfs, or works, or any " part thereof, and for all and every other use that shall be " made of the said landing-place, quays, wharfs, or works, or " any part thereof, the several tolls, rates, duties, dues, and " payments mentioned and specified in the first schedule to " this Act annexed, or such less tolls, rates, dues, and duties as the said Commissioners shall from time to time think proper, u which tolls, rates, duties, and payments shall be vested in " the said Commissioners, and shall be paid and applied in " such and the same manner as the rates and assessments to " be levied and raised for the repairing and amending the u highways, streets, ways, paths, passages, and the said

3 M 3 " landing-

«#> Cap. 65. Local Government Suftpimmtal (Jfo. SO & 31 Vict.

" landing-places, quays, wharfe, and works, and for erecting " and maintaining a market-house and market in the said " town, are directed to be paid and applied, and in aid and " addition thereto: Provided always, that nothing in this " Act contained shall extend or be construed to extend to " authorize or empower the said Commissioners to demand,

" collect, or receive of and from the person or persons for " the time being occupying the messuage or dwelling house " called the Torbay Boats in the said town any tolls, rates,

" or duties for landing on or embarking from the said landing- place, quays, wharfs, or works, or for any goods, wares,

" merchandises, cattle, or other tiling, the property of and " actually belonging to him, them, or any of them, which shall u or may from time to time be landed or embarked from the " said landing-place, quays, wharfe, and work, or any part " thereof

And whereas the wharf or landing-place opposite the said place called Feathers Hill, being the place by the said Act to which the said Commissioners had the power to add| to and extend so as to enable vessels to lay alongside, and to lay and ship goods and passengers thereon and therefrom, was, after the passing of the said Act, found to be a locality unsuited for such purpose, and in consequence such wharf or landing-place has never been added to or extended, and the tolls which would have been received if such addition or extension had taken plaoe have never been received:

And whereas the said Local Board of Health set forth in the said Petition that there is another wharf or landing-place within the said town, which landing-place is called the Fountain Slipway, where vessels may lie alongside, goods and passengers may conveniently land and be shipped, that such landing-place is immediately opposite the Railway Terminus, and in all respects a desirable locality for the purpose, and they therefore pray that the said Act may |be amended by inserting the words, " And it shall be lawful for the said Local Board to " add to the wharf or landing-place called the Fountain " Slipway," instead of the words "to add to the wharf or " landing-place situate opposite the place called Feathers Hill,1' and, by such other alterations and amendments as may be requisite, to transfer the powers now given in relation to the landing-place opposite Feathers Hill to the landing-place called the Fountain Slipway:

And whereas the said messuage or dwelling house called the Torbay Boats in the said town is part of the property held under^the will and codicils of George Ward, hie of North-wood Park, Cowee, and a certain messuage or dwelling house called the Fountain Hotel, situate dose to the said Fountain Slipway, is also part of the property hdd under the same will and codicils, and it is expedient that if the alteration prayed for in the Petition of the said Local Board be granted the words "Fountain Hotel" should be substituted in the said

recited

m

1867. Local Government Supplemental (No. 2). Cap. 65.

recited thirteenth section of the said Act instead of the words " Torbay Boats

And whereas, in pursuance of the Local Government Act, 1858, inquiry has been made in the said district in respect of the several matters mentioned in the said Petition, and it appears expedient to issue a Provisional Order in relation to the said matters, but no such Order can be valid without the confirmation of Parliament:

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the powers vested in me by the said Local Government Act, I, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do, by this Provisional Order under my hand, direct that from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this Order —

The said Local Act shall be altered, first, by the substitution in the thirteenth section of such Act (56 Geo. 8. cap. 25) of the words, " It shall be lawful for the Local Board of Health " for the District of West Cowes to add to the wharf or " landing-place called the Fountain Slipway," instead of the following words in the said section, u It shall be lawful for " the said Commissioners to add to the wharf or landing-place " situate opposite the place called Feathers Hill;" and the aforesaid Local Board of Health shall have all the powers transferred to them with respect and in relation to the said wharf and landing-place called the Fountain Slipway which the Commissioners aforesaid possessed in relation to the wharf or landing-place opposite Feathers Hill, in the herein-before recited section of the said Local Act mentioned, anything in such Act to the contrary notwithstanding. And, secondly, the said Local Act shall be altered by the substitution in the same section of the said Act of the words " Fountain Hotel " instead of the words " Torbay Boats " in the said section, and the occupier or occupiers for the time being of the said messuage or dwelling house called the Fountain Hotel shall have all the rights and privileges of the said section given to the occupier or occupiers for the time being of the said messuage or dwelling house called the Torbay Boats.

Provided always, that, inasmuch as the Fountain Pier immediately to the northward of the Fountain Slipway is private property, forming part of the estate held under the said will and codicil of the said George Ward, deceased, the following provisions shall have full effect; that is to say, —

The said Local Board shall not do any act, matter, or thing whatsoever which shall or may cause any obstruction or impediment whatsoever to the passing or repassing or to the traffic of any steamers or other vessels which may approach, depart from, or use, or attempt to approach, depart from, or use, the said quay called or known as the Fountain Quay, or the pontoon or landing stage, for the purpose of binding or embarking passengers, goods, or otherwise; neither shall the said Local Board do or omit, or permit to be done or omitted,

at any time hereafter, any act, matter, or thing soever which shall be a breach in the performance or observance of any of the covenants on their part contained in a certain indenture of lease dated the second day of April one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, and made between William George Ward, of North-wood Park aforesaid, Esquire, (the present tenant under the said will and codicils,) of the one part, and the said Local Board of the other part, whereby a certain causeway called the New Fountain Causeway, partly adjoining the said Fountain Slipway, was demised to the said Local Board for the term, and at the rent, and subject to the covenants, provisoes, and agreements mentioned in the said indenture of lease.

ACCRINGTON.

Provisional Order for extending the Borrowing Powers of the Accrington Local Board of Health.

Whereas the Local Board of Health for the District of Accrington in the County of Lancaster require to carry out, under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1858, works of a permanent nature, including works of sewerage and water supply, within their District, but the sum that will be required to carry out and complete the said works will exceed the assessable value for one year of the premises assessable under the said Act within such District:

And whereas the said Board have now, under the authority of the 78th section of the Local Government Act, 1858, petitioned me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, for powers to borrow or reborrow any sum or sums on mortgage of the rates leviable by the aforesaid Local Board of Health under the powers of the Local Government Act, 1858, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole two years assessable value of the premises assessable within the District in respect of which such sum or sums may be borrowed:

And whereas after due inquiry and report by Robert Morgan, Esquire, the Inspector appointed by me for the purpose, I am of opinion that the prayer of such Petition should be granted, but the same cannot be done without the consent of Parliament:

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the power now vested in me as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State as aforesaid, I do hereby, by this Provisional Order under my hand, direct as follows:

That from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this present Order —

The Local Board of Health for the District of Accrington in the County of Lancaster shall have power and authority

to

Local Government Act, 1858, petitioned one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State for poorer to borrow or reborrow, on mortgage of the rates, sums which with the sums already borrowed by that Board will not exceed in the whole two years' assessable value of the premises within the District in respect of which such sums may be borrowed; and such sums will be required for permanent works referred to in such Petition or contemplated in the said District.

And whereas after due inquiry and report by Robert Morgan, Esquire, the Inspector appointed under the said Act for the purpose, I am of opinion that the prayer of such Petition should be granted; but the same cannot be done without the consent of Parliament.

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the powers now vested in me as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State as aforesaid, I do hereby, by this Provisional Order under my hand, direct as follows: —

That from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this present Order, —

1. — The Local Board for the District of Oswaldtwistle, in the County of Lancaster, shall have power and authority to borrow or reborrow, for the execution and com* pletion of works of a permanent nature within such District, and on mortgage of the rates leviable by them as such Board, a sum or sums which shall not, with the sums already borrowed by them, exceed in the whole two years' assessable value of the premises assessable under the Local Government Act, 1858, within the aforesaid District; the aforesaid sum or sums to be repaid, with interest thereon, within a period of fifty years from the date of the borrowing thereof.

The office of " Censor Theologiae," if created, is, like other offices in the House, to be subject to the power of making Byelaws or Regulations possessed by the Governing Body.

XIV. — The Sub-Dean.

The Candidates shall be examined in such subjects connected with the studies of the University as the Governing Body shall from time to time determine; provided that the system of examinations shall be such as shall render Senior Studentships accessible from time to time to excellence in every branch of knowledge for the time being recognized in the Schools of the University; and the Governing Body shall choose that Candidate who after such examination shall appear to them to be of the greatest merit and most fit to be a Senior Student of the House as a place of religion, learning, and education. That Candidate for whom the greatest number of votes shall have been given shall be deemed elected. Whenever there shall be no duly qualified Candidate for a vacant Senior Studentship whom the Governing Body shall judge of sufficient merit for election, and whenever a Senior

Studentship shall fall vacant and there shall not be time to give the notice herein-before directed before the day of election, the election shall be postponed to some other day, to be fixed by the Governing Body, not later than the next ensuing stated day of election to Senior Studentships; and every such postponed election shall be held and conducted in the same manner, and after the same previous notice, as if there had been no postponement.

Of the said twenty-eight Senior Studentships, nine (including the Lee's Readerships herein-after mentioned) shall be Lay, and nineteen shall be Clerical, Studentships. The holders of the Lay Studentships shall not be required, as a condition of retaining their Studentships, to take Holy Orders; but if any Lay Student should do so, then upon the next vacancy in a Clerical Studentship a Lay Student shall be elected, so that the aforesaid proportion between Lay and Clerical Studentships shall always be preserved as nearly as may be. No person shall be eligible to a Clerical Studentship who shall not either be a Priest or Deacon of the United Church of England and Ireland, or declare that he intends to take Holy Orders in the said Church. Every person who shall have made such declaration, or who at the time of his election shall be in Deacon's Orders, shall be required to take Priest's Orders within four years after the time at which he shall be of sufficient standing, according to the Statutes of the University, to take the Degree of Master of Arts, and in default thereof shall vacate his Studentship: Provided that it shall be lawfuf for the Governing Body, in case of sickness, or for any other very urgent cause, to grant a delay for a period not exceeding six months. Such additional Senior Studentships as the Governing Body may hereafter establish, to the number of Twelve or fewer, shall likewise be divided into Clerical and Lay Studentships, one at least in every three being a Lay Studentship. Any Senior Studentships which may be established after the number has been raised to Forty may also be divided in the same or any other proportion, or may be exclusively Lay or Clerical, as the Governing Body may think fit.

Every person elected to a Senior Studentship shall undergo probation for twelve calendar months from the day of his election inclusive, and at the end of such twelve calendar months shall be admitted an actual Senior Student, if found fit in the judgment of the Governing Body. Every person admitted to probation shall receive during the period of probation the same emoluments as if he had been admitted an actual Senior Student, but shall not be entitled to vote on any occasion.

Every Senior Student who shall marry shall thereupon vacate his Studentship.

Every Senior Student who shall be instituted to an ecclesiastical benefice, or shall become entitled, either by descent or devolution, or by virtue of any testamentary or other gift [No. 63.] 3 R or

Cap. 76. Christ Church (Oxfoi'd) Ordinances. 30 & 31 Vict.

or settlement, to property, or to any government pension, or be admitted to any office tenable for life or during good behaviour (not being an academical office within the University of Oxford), and who shall retain such benefice, property, pension, or office for twelve calendar months from the day of his institution, accession, or admission thereto, shall, if such ecclesiastical benefice be a benefice with cure of souls (except in certain cases to be specified as herein-after mentioned), or if the annual income derivable by him from such property, pension, or office, or from any ecclesiastical benefice without cure of souls, or from any two or more of the above-mentioned sources (including or not including a benefice with cure of souls), clear of deductions (except for property or income tax), shall exceed 500?., vacate his Studentship at the expiration of such twelve calendar months; and for this purpose the income which the estimated value of any property would produce, if invested in Three pounds per Centum Consolidated Annuities, at the price current at the time of the acquisition thereof, shall, in case of doubt, be considered to be the income derivable from such property. The Governing Body may, by a Byelaw or Byelaws, declare in what cases a benefice with cure of souls may be tenable with a Senior Studentship. The word " property " shall in this clause include any estate or interest in possession in any property, real or personal.

Provisional Order] repealing and altering Parts of a Local Act in force within the District of the Exeter Local Board.

Whereas the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the City and Borough and County of the City of Exeter, acting as the Local Board in and for the City aforesaid, in which the Local Government Act, 1858, is in force, have, in pursuance of such Act, presented a Petition to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, praying for the alteration and partial repeal of a certain Local Act of Parliament in force within their District, having relation to the purposes of the said Local Government Act, and not conferring powers or privileges upon any corporation, company, undertakers, or individuals for their own pecuniary benefit; that is to say,

An Act passed in the second and third years of the reign of His late Majesty King William the Fourth (cap. 106.), intituled " An Act for better paving, lighting, watching, " cleansing, and otherwise improving the City of Exeter " and County of the said City And whereas, in pursuance of the said Local Government Act, inquiry has been made in the said District in respect of the several matters mentioned in the said Petition by Arnold Taylor, Esquire, the Inspector appointed by me for the purpose; and report has been made by him to me therein, and I have taken the same into consideration:

And whereas it appears expedient to issue a Provisional Order in relation to the said matters, but no such Order can be valid without confirmation by Parliament:

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the powers vested in me by the said Local Government Act, I, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do, by this Provisional Order under my hand, direct, —

That from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this Order —

1; — The parts of the said herein-before recited Local Act passed in the second and third years of the reign of King William the Fourth (cap. 106.), specified in the Schedule hereunto annexed, shall be repealed, altered, or extended as is therein described.

and be bad and exercised by the said Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses, as the Local Board under the said Local Government Act, 1858, and by such of the committees, officers, and servants of the said Local Board as shall be appointed by the said Board in that behalf under the said Local Government Act, and shall be had and exercised in the same manner, as nearly as may be, as if such powers, authorities, privileges, and duties had been granted or imposed by the said Local Government Act; and that the said Local Board shall be the Commissioners for executing such parts of the said Local Act as shall not be repealed; and that all lands, buildings, works, rates, arrears, tolls, duties, and hereditaments, utensils, materials, books, plans, maps, deeds, effects, contracts, papers, monies, and securities for money, and all other property whatsoever, belonging to or vested in the Commissioners acting in execution of the said Local Act, shall be transferred to, vested in, belong to, and be recoverable by the said Local Board as fully as the same would or could have belonged to, been vested in, or recoverable by such Commissioners, and, as near as circumstances will permit, be held by the said Local Board upon the same trusts, and for the same uses, intents, and purposes, as the same were or would be held by such Commissioners.

3. — All bonds, mortgages, annuities, contracts, debts, monies,

and securities for money made, given, contracted, or payable by such Commissioners shall be paid and satisfied by the said Local Board out of such transferred property as would or ought to have been charged or chargeable in respect of the same if such transfer had not been made, and shall, as near as circumstances will permit, have the same priority, and be paid and satisfied within the same time, and be recovered from the said Local Board as the same might have been recovered from the said Commissioners.

4. — If such property be insufficient for that purpose the

deficiency shall be charged upon and paid and satisfied by the said Local Board out of the rates leviable under the said Local Government Act, 1858.

5. — If such property be more than sufficient the surplus

shall be applied, as nearly as may be, to the same purposes to which the same would or ought to have been applied if the said Local Government Act had not been adopted as aforesaid.

4. — All charges and expenses which shall be incurred by the said Local Board under such parts of the said Local Act a9 shall not be repealed shall be deemed

to

1103

1867. Local Government Supplemented (No. 6). Cap. 123.

to be expenses incurred by such Board under the said Local Government Act, and shall be defrayed out of the General District Rate (as the nature of the case may require); and the monies necessary to be raised for the purposes of such Local Act may be borrowed, charged, received, and recovered in the same manner as if such charges and expenses were actually incurred under the said Local Government Act, 1868.

7. — All proceedings, contracts, matters, and things respectively begun or made, or penalties incurred, under any section of the said Local Act which may be hereafter repealed may respectively be proceeded with and enforced as if no such repeal had taken place; and all powers exercised or byelaws made under any such section shall continue in force until the new powers and byelaws authorized by the said Local Government Act are brought into operation; and that no such repeal shall affect any decree or order of the High Court of Chancery, or of any other Court of Justice, that has heretofore been obtained or shall have been obtained before such repeal

DEVONPORT.

Provisional Order repealing and altering Parts of a Local Act in force within the District of the Devonport Local Board.

Whereas the Local Government Act, 1858, has been duly adopted by a resolution of the council of the borough of Devonport, and by reason of such adoption the said Act, except as herein-after mentioned, now has the force of law within the said borough, and the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses acting by the council of the borough have become the Local Board for the District of such borough:

And whereas by an Act passed in the 54th year of the reign of His Majesty George the Third, c. 172., intituled " An Act to " repeal an Act passed in the twenty-first year of His present " Majesty for better maintaining and regulating the poor u within the town of Plymouth Dock and Parish of Stoke " Damerel in the county of Devon, and for other purposes, " and granting further powers in lieu thereof for lighting, " watching, and otherwise improving the said town and " parish, and regulating porters and watermen therein," certain provisions were made and certain powers were conferred upon Commissioners thereby appointed for the paving and cleansing of the streets, lanes, and passages within the said town and parish, and removing and preventing encroachments, nuisances, and annoyances therein, and for divers other purposes having relation to many of the purposes provided for by the Local Government Act, 1858; and such Act of 54 Geo. 3. c. 172. is herein-after styled a the Local Act

And whereas the said Local Act applies to and is in force within the same District as that which now constitutes the District of the borough of Devonport, and does not confer powers or privileges upon any corporation, company, undertakers, or individuals for their own pecuniary benefit, and it is expedient that provision should be made for the future execution of the Local Act within the District aforesaid, and that such Act should be altered in the manner herein-after set forth;

[i\To. 93.] 5 A And

1106

Cap. 123. Local Government Supplemental (No. 6). SO & 31 Vict.

And whereas the Local Board aforesaid have under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1858, presented a Petition to me as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, praying that provision should be made for the future execution by the Local Board of the provisions of the Local Act aforesaid (except so far as the same relates to relieving, maintaining, and regulating the poor of the parish of Stoke Damerel now vested in the Commissioners acting under the said Act), and for the transfer to the Local Board of certain of the powers and duties conferred and imposed by such Local Act upon the Commissioners in manner herein-after set forth; and on the receipt of such Petition Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department directed Robert Morgan, Esquire, the Inspector appointed for the purpose, to visit the said District, and the said Inspector has now inquired in the District aforesaid into the subject-matter of such Petition, and has duly reported to me thereon:

And whereas it appears expedient to issue a Provisional Order in relation to the said matters, but no such Order can be valid without confirmation by Parliament:

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the powers vested in me by the Local Government Act, 1858, I, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do, by this Provisional Order under my hand, direct, —

1. — That from and after the date of the confirmation of this

Order all the enactments and provisions of the Local Act aforesaid (54 Geo. 3. c. 172.) which can now be executed by the Commissioners (except such as refer to or in anywise concern or affect the relief maintenance, and regulation of the poor of the parish of Stoke Damerel) shall be carried into execution by the Local Board in place of the Commissioners, and that for this purpose all the powers, rights, duties, and authorities conferred or imposed on the Commissioners by the Local Act (except as aforesaid) shall be transferred to and thenceforth be vested in and executed by the Local Board as fully and completely as by the Commissioners.

2. — That from and after such date as aforesaid all the

provisions, powers, and authorities made or conferred by the Local Government Act, 1858, which in anywise relate to the same or similar purposes as those included in the Local Act shall, except so far as the same may be in anywise repugnant to or inconsistent with the provisions of the Local Act, come into operation within the district of and be exercised by the Local Board conjointly with and in addition to the provisions, powers, and authorities of the Local Act.

3. — That from and after such date as aforesaid all monies,

securities for monies, rights of action, contracts,

property,

4. — -That from and after such date as aforesaid all arrears of rates made and levied by the Commissioners acting in pursuance of the Local Act shall be due and payable to the Local Board in place of the Commissioners, and the Local Board shall have all the powers and remedies for recovering and enforcing payment of any such arrears in their name and on their account, and by their officers, as the Commissioners would have had if this Order had not been made and confirmed; and all outstanding claims, debts, and demands to which the Commissioners shall be liable (except such as relate to the relief, maintenance, and regulation of the poor) shall be transferred from them and shall be chargeable to the Local Board, and shall be discharged and liquidated by such Board as soon as practicable after the date aforesaid.

6, — That from and after such date as aforesaid the principal and interest of all monies borrowed at interest by the Commissioners acting in pursuance of the Local Act and then outstanding, and all annuities granted by the Commissioners acting under the Local Act, or charged by the Local Act upon the rate to be levied and received in pursuance of the same, so far as the same respectively are now legally due and payable, shall become and be a charge upon the rates hereafter to be levied and received by the Local Board in pursuance of the Local Act and of this Order, in like manner as they would have been a charge upon the rates to be levied and received by the Commissioners under the Local Act if this Order had not been made and confirmed.

6. — That all other the debts and liabilities (if any) which may have been legally incurred by the Commissioners acting in pursuance of the purposes of the said Local Act (other than purposes relating to the relief maintenance, and regulation of the poor) shall be satisfied and discharged by the Local Board out of the monies (if any) transferred from the Commis-5 A 2 sioners

7. — That from and after the date of the confirmation of this

Order it shall be lawful for the Local Board, notwithstanding anything contained in the 84th section of an Act passed in the sixth year of the reign of His Majesty William the Fourth, cap. 76., entitled " An Act to provide for the regulation of Municipal " Corporations in England and Wales," or in any other Act amending, explaining, or extending the same, to raise and levy by rates and assessments made in such manner and to such amount as by the Local Act is authorized such sum or sums of money as the Local Board shall from time to time judge necessary and sufficient for defraying the expenses ot carrying into effect such of the purposes and provisions of the Local Act as the Local Board shall by this Order, confirmed as aforesaid, be authorized to execute.

10. — That it shall be lawful for the Local Board, in case they shall deem it more expedient, instead of borrowing money for the repayment of such principal money or the redemption of such annuities as aforesaid, to set apart in every year, out of the rates and assessments to be made and levied by them under and by virtue of the Local Act, as a sinking fund, and accumulate in the way of compound interest, by investing the 5 A 3 same

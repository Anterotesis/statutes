Assessment which would be leviable from each Electoral Division are not presented to be expended on some Work within such Division, the Proceedings at such Sessions must be considered with strict reference to the Provisions of the 9th and 10th Victoria, Chapter 107.

His Excellency, considering also that many Baronies have already held Sessions under that Act, to which Baronies the Opportunity of making' Applications in the Manner now prescribed has not been afforded, it is his Desire that all Works already sanctioned in those Baronies, or applied for and which it may become requisite to sanction* in order to afford continued Employment, shall be proceeded with until other Sessions may be conveniently held in such BaronieB.

His Excellency, in taking upon himself the Responsibility, trader the urgent Circumstances of the Case, of inviting the Magistrates and Cess-payers to provide Employment for the People by the Execution of useful and re-productive Works, Confidently trusts, with their Assistance and the Blessing of the Almighty on their united Exertions, that the Calamity with which it has pleased Providence to afflict Ireland may yet in its Results become conducive to the Production of a greater Abundance of human Food from the Soil, and to the future permanent Improvement of the Country.

I have the Honour to be.

the said Act were directed to be paid to the Receiver General

of Scotland, and to be applied in the Manner therein mentioned: And whereas another Act was passed in the Third

Year of the Reign of His Majesty King George the Fourth, intituled An Act for regulating the Fees chargeable in His Majesty's General Registry House at Edinburgh, and for ctm. 4 pleting the Buildings necessary for keeping the Public Records of Scotland therein, whereby it was provided, that the B *

lance of all Fees, that had arisen and should thereafter arise, and which were directed by the said first-recited Act to be paid to the Receiver General of Scotland, should be paid to

the Persons in the said second-recited Act named, to the Amount of Thirty thousand Pounds, to be applied by thee

in completing and fitting-up the Buildings of the Genoa!

Register House or Repository of the Public Records of Scdland: And whereas another Act was passed in the Seventh and Eighth Years of the Reign of His said Majesty Kin? 4 George the Fourth, intituled An Act for the better enabling tkt Commissioners appointed by an Act passed in the Third Year d 4 His present Majesty to complete the Buildings of His Majesty) 4 General Register House at Edinburgh, whereby it was enacted that the Balance of all such Fees as had already arisen or

should thereafter arise, and which were directed by the said first-recited Act to be paid to the Receiver General of Scatland, should be paid to the Persons therein named, to the Amount in all of Twenty thousand Pounds, to be applied by them, or any Three or more of them, in enlarging, altering. 4 and improving, and completing and fitting-up, the Building intended for a general Repository of the Public Records of Scotland: And whereas, for the greater Convenience of the Courts of Justice and of the Public, and to accomplish with as little Delay as possible the Purposes of the said Acts, by enlarging, altering, and improving, and completing and fittingup, the said Buildings, it became necessary for the said Coo* 4 missioners to borrow, and they did accordingly borrow certain considerable Sums of Money, which were all duly applied fa the Purposes of the said Acts: And whereas by Reports male by the Persons named as Commissioners by the said Two 4 last-recited Acts, in pursuance thereof, to the Two Houses of Parliament, it appears that the annual Amount of the Balances thereby directed to be paid and applied as aforesaid fell much short of their expected Amount, and the Result of various Measures adopted by Parliament for the Amelioration of the Law of Scotland also tended considerably to diminish the Fee 4 applicable to the Purposes of the said Two last-recited Acts,

4 whereby there remains unpaid of the said Sums so borrowed,

and applied to the Purposes aforesaid, as ascertained by Report of the Queen's and Lord High Treasurer's Remembrancer in Scotland, a Balance of Seventeen thousand two hundred and seventy-three Pounds or thereby, and there are no Means for the Extinction thereof available or likely to arise out of the

thereout of the Salary of the Lord Clerk Register, which, after

the Death of the late Lord Clerk Register, was by the said *' first-recited Act appointed to be paid out of such Fees, and it ' is necessary to make further Provision for Payment of the said Balance: And whereas, upon the Decision of certain

legal Proceedings which took place in relation to the Fees of the Office of Director in Chancery connected with the said

Register House, a Sum of Twenty thousand seven hundred i and eleven Pounds Fourteen Shillings and One Penny has ' been paid into Bank to the Credit of the said Office of Di-i rector in Chancery; and it is just and expedient that so much

of the said Sum as shall be necessary to extinguish the said ' Debt should be applied to that end Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall be lawful to the Lord High Treasury to Treasurer of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, authorise Re-or the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury of the said ^Uaud^to*^ United Kingdom, or any Three or more of them, and they are apply certain hereby required, by Warrant under their Hands, to authorize MoniesinPay-Her Majesty's and the Lord High Treasurer's Remembrancer j^"tred in the in Scotland to apply so much of the said Sum of Twenty Completion of thousand seven hundred and eleven Pounds Fourteen Shillings the Register and One Penny, now standing at the Credit of the Office of Director in Chancery as aforesaid, in Payment and Extinction accruing

of the said Debt of .Seventeen thousand two hundred and thereon, seventy-three Pounds Nine Shillings and Seven-pence, incurred in the Completion of the said Register House, together with any Interest which may accrue thereon before the same be paid, and to direct that the same be duly discharged accordingly.

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the Session held in the

' Fifth and Sixth Years of the Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act to promote the Drainage of Lands, and Improvement of Navigation and Water Power in connexion with such Drainage, in Ireland: And whereas the said Act was amended by an Act passed in the Eighth and Ninth Year? of the Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act to amend an Act of the Sixth Year of Her present Majesty, for promoting the Drainage of Lands, and Improvement of Navigation and Water Power in connexion with such Drainage, in Ireland; and also by an Act passed in the Ninth Year of the Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act to amend the Acts for promoting the Drainage of Lands, and Improvement of Navigation and Water Power in connexion with such Drainage, in Ireland, and to afford Facilities for increased Employment for the Labouring Classes in Works of Drainage during the present Year: And whereas by the last-mentioned Act, after referring to the Failure or Destruction of a Portion of the Potato Crop of the then last Year in Ireland, and to the Distress which might thereby prevail among the Labouring Classes in certain Districts, and to the Expediency of giving for Part of the then present Year increased Facilities for various Works of Utility connected with the Drainage and Improvement of Lands in such Districts, it was enacted and declared, that the Provisions therein-after contained should be called and deemed to be " Provisions for summary Proceedings " under the said Act, and that no Work should be undertaken or commenced under such Provisions for summary Proceedings as to the Execution of which Work the Assents of the Proprietors of Lands, as required by the Provisions of the said Act therein-before contained, should not have been

be drained or improved, should have been given to the pro-c posed Works: And whereas, by reason of the Destruction of ' a large Portion of the Potato Crop of last Year in Ireland,

it is expedient, for the Purposes of affording increased Faci-

lities for Employment, to continue for a limited Time the

aforesaid Provisions for summary Proceedings, amending the same as herein-after mentioned Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That notwithstanding any thing contained in the said last-mentioned Act it shall be lawful to commence or undertake, under the Provisions for summary Proceedings in the 6ame Act contained, any Works by such Provisions authorized as to the Execution of which Works the Assents of the Proprietors of Lands as required by the same Act (subject to the Provisions of this Act) shall be given or obtained at any Time before the Termination of Twelve Months from the passing of this Act, or before the End of the then next Session of Parliament, but no later; and that all the said Provisions for summary Proceedings shall be valid and effectual accordingly for the Purposes of Works to be commenced or undertaken under the Provisions of this present Act.

Lives, or for a Term of Years, whereof more than Fourteen

Years should be unexpired, the Consent in Writing of such ' Person should be necessary in order to give Validity to the Assent of the Proprietor in respect of the Lands comprised in

such Grant, Lease, or Agreement: And wThereas great Delay ' in consequence of such Provision has arisen in the Commence-

ment of the Works under said Acts without any commensurate Advantage to the Parties interested, and in order to increase the Facilities for affording Employment it is expedient to amend the samebe it enacted, That notwithstanding any thing in the said recited Acts or any of them contained, no Consent of any Person in the actual Occupation of any Land under any Grant, Lease, or Agreement in Writing for a Lease for a Life or Lives or for a Term of Years whereof more than Fourteen Years shall be unexpired to the Execution of the

CAP. LXXX.

An Act to amend an Act of the last Session for facilitating the Employment of the labouring Poor in the distressed Districts in Ireland, so far as relates to Compensation for Damages.

[22d July 1847.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the last Session of Parliament, intituled An Act to facilitate the Employ- D&io Vict. ment of the labouring Poor for a limited Period in the distressed c-107* Districts in Ireland: And whereas another Act was passed in the present Session of Parliament, intituled An Act to render io&ii Vict. valid certain Proceedings for the Relief of Distress in Ireland, c. 10. by Employment of the labouring Poor, and to indemnify those who have acted in such Proceedings: And whereas under the Provisions of the said Acts the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland were authorized to execute the Works therein provided to be executed for the Relief of the Poor, and for that Purpose, by themselves and their Officers and Persons employed by them, to take and acquire any Ground that might be necessary for the making of such Works, Satisfaction being rendered to the Proprietors or Occupiers in the Manner by the said first-recited Act provided: And whereas under the Provisions of the said recited Acts the Cost of executing such Works (save Works of Drainage and Subsoiling in the said secondly-recited Act mentioned) were-directed to be charged upon the respective Baronies, Half Baronies, Electoral Divisions, or Parts of Electoral Divisions,

Districts, Counties of Cities, or Counties of Towns, as the Case may be, for which such Works were presented, and to be levied in like Manner as Poor Rate, and it is expedient that the Compensation for Damages caused by taking of Land

Grand Jury may postpone Traverses, &c. for Damages under the recited Acts not already tried to the Spring Assizes 1848.

' for the Execution of such Works should be charged upon the same respective Places, and in the same Manner respectively:

And whereas, owing to the great Extent of the Failure of the Potato Crop, and the Number of such Works required to be executed for the Employment of the Poor, the Compensation claimed for Damages is likely to amount to a considerable Sum, and it is therefore expedient to make other Provision for the Levy and Payment thereof than is by the said first-recited Act provided, and to empower Grand Jurics, if they shall so think fit, to postpone such Levy and Payment for a limited Time Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That after the passing of this Act it shall be lawful for the Grand Jury of any County, County of a City, or County of a Town, at the Summer Assizes of this Year, in Cases of Claims for Compensation for Damages to any Land or Premises taken or occupied for the Purpose of any Works under the Provisions of the said recited Acts, to postpone the making of Presentments in such Cases as to them shall seem expedient, from the said Summer Assizes to the Spring Assizes of the Year One thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, at which last-mentioned Assizes it shall be lawful for the Grand Jury to make Presentment for such Damages in Cases where the Amount of the same shall have been determined on the Trial of Traverses at the said Summer Assizes pursuant to the said recited Acts, without further Notice or Trial, in the same Manner as such Presentments could be made at the said Summer Assizes; and in all other Cases of Claims for such Damages where Presentments shall not have been made as hereby last authorized, or at such Summer Assizes, or, in the Case of the County of Dublin at the Presenting Term of this Year (whether or not Application shall have been made for such Damages at such Summer Assizes or Presenting Term), it shall and may be lawful for the respective Persons claiming such Compensation for Damages to any Land or Premises in respect of which Certificates shall have been given by the proper Officers of the said Commissioners of Public Works, or the County Surveyor, as the Case may be, under the Provisions of the first-recited Act or this Act, upon giving such Notice as in the said first-recited Act required, to make any such Application to the Grand Jury, or to enter any such Traverse for Damages, and for the respective Grand Juries to present for such Damages at the Spring Assizes or Presenting Term, as the Case may be, of the Year One thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, but not at any subsequent Assizes or Presenting Term, unless some Order of the Court shall be made at such Spring Assizes or Presenting Term for the Adjournment of any such Application, Traverse, or Presentment respectively, the Sums so presented to be paid, in the Manner herein-after mentioned; and such Applications, Traverses, or Presentments, and the several Matters relating to the same, shall be subject to

681

like Provisions as in the said first-recited Act contained as such Provisions are amended by this Act: Provided always, that the Claims of the several Parties interested in the same Premises, and claiming such Compensation, shall, so far as conveniently may be, be heard, considered, or tried together.

II. And be it enacted and declared, That Applications for Compensation as aforesaid, and Traverses for Damages, may be made, entered, or presented for in respect of Damages caused by the taking of Land for Works executed under the Provisions of the said secondly-recited Act (save Works of Drainage and Subsoiling as aforesaid) in like Manner as in the Case of Works executed under the Provisions of the said first-recited Act; provided that Certificates shall be obtained from the respective Officers of the said Commissioners of Public Works or the County Surveyor, as the Case may be, pursuant to the Provisions of the said first-recited Act as amended by this Act.

III. And be it enacted, That, any thing in the said first-recited Act to the contrary notwithstanding, any Certificate of the Amount of Damage sustained, or of other Matters in the said Act specified and therein required to be given, by the Officer or County Surveyor by whom any such Works shall have been or shall be executed, may be given by any Officer of the said Commissioners of Public Works by them appointed for that Purpose, and that in such Certificate the total estimated Amount of the Damage or Injury done to all Parties interested in the same Premises may be stated, the Officer making due Allowance in fixing such Amount for any Advantages conferred by such Work upon such Parties: Provided always, that nothing herein or in the said recited Acts contained shall be construed to prevent the Grand Jury, or any Jury before whom such Claim shall be tried upon a Traverse, from increasing or lessening the Amount of Compensation mentioned in such Certificate.

IV. And be it enacted, That in all Cases of Presentments made at the Summer Assizes of this Year, or at any subsequent Assizes, or future Presenting Term, for the Payment of any Sum or Sums of Money to any Person or Persons as the Occupier or Occupiers of any such Land, such Sum or Sums of Money shall be inserted in and levied under the Warrant of the Treasury, to be issued at the Time of issuing such Treasurer's Warrant for the Levy of Grand Jury Cess after such Assizes or Presenting Term; and such Sum or Sums, when the same shall be levied under such Warrant, shall be paid over to such respective Person or Persons entitled thereto.

V. And be it enacted, That any Sum of Money which shall have been presented at the said Summer Assizes of this Year, or which shall hereafter be presented at any Assizes or Presenting Term, for such Damages to be paid to any Person or Persons other than the Occupier of any Land, shall not be levied or inserted in the Treasurer's Warrant for such Levy until after the Summer Assizes or Presenting Term of the Yeir One thousand eight hundred and forty-eight; and in all J Cases

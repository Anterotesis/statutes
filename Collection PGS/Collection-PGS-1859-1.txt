[Power to Treasury to grant Allowances on Abolition of Offices.]

VII. It shall be lawful for the Commissioners of the Treasury to grant to any Person retiring or removed from the Public Service in consequence of the Abolition of his Office, or for the Purpose of facilitating Improvements in the Organization of the Department to which he belongs, by which greater Efficiency and Economy can be effected, such special annual Allowance by way of Compensation as on a full Consideration of the Circumstances of the Case may seem to the said Commissioners to be a reasonable and just Compensation for the Loss of Office; and if the Compensation shall exceed the Amount to which such Person would have been entitled under the Scale of Superannuation provided by this Act if Ten Years were added to the Number of Years which he may have actually served, such Allowance shall be granted by special Minute, stating the special Grounds for granting such Allowance, which Minute shall be laid before Parliament, and no such Allowance shall exceed Two Thirds of the Salary and Emoluments of the Office.

[Condition of Grant of full Superannuations to public Servants not Heads of Department.]

[Power to Treasury to grant Allowances for special Services,]

IX. Provided, That it shall be lawful for the Commissioners of the Treasury to grant to any Person any Superannuation, Compensation, Gratuity, or other Allowance of greater Amount than the Amount which might be awarded to him under the foregoing Provisions, when special Services rendered by such Person, and requiring special Reward, shall appear to them to justify such Increase, but so that such Allowance shall in no Case exceed the Salary and Emoluments enjoyed by the Grantee at the Time of Retirement, and the Grounds of every such Increase shall be stated in a Minute of the Treasury, which shall be laid before Parliament;

[and for Demerits in individual Cases.]

and it shall be lawful for the said Commissioners to grant to any Person any such Allowance of less Amount than otherwise would have been awarded to him where his Defaults or Demerit in relation to the Public Service appear to them to justify such Diminution.

X. It shall not be lawful to grant any Superannuation Allowance under the Provisions of this Act to any Person who shall be under Sixty Years, unless upon Medical Certificate to the Satisfaction of the Commissioners of the Treasury that he is incapable, from Infirmity of Mind or Body, to discharge the Duties of his Situation, and that such Infirmity is likely to be permanent.

22° VICTORIAE, c. 26. 153

[Persons superannuated under Sixty may be required to serve again.]

XI. Every Person to whom a Superannuation or Compensation Allowance shall have been granted before he shall have attained the Age of Sixty Years shall, until he has attained that Age, be liable to be called upon to fill, in any Part of Her Majesty's Dominions in which he shall before have served, any Public Office or Situation under the Crown for which his previous public Services may render him eligible; and if he shall decline, when called upon to do so, to take upon him such Office or Situation, or shall decline or neglect to execute the Duties thereof satisfactorily, being in a competent State of Health, he shall forfeit his Right to the Compensation or Superannuation Allowance which had been granted to him.

[Persons to retain Right to Superannuation on Transfer to other Employment under the Crown.]

XII. And whereas it will be for the Advantage of the Public Service that Officers holding Employments entitling them to Superannuation Allowances under this or other Acts shall be eligible for other Public Employments at home and abroad, without forfeiting their Claims to such Allowances:

Every Officer already or hereafter to be transferred from Employment entitling him to Superannuation Allowance to Public Employment under the Crown not so entitling him shall be entitled, on his ultimate Retirement from the Public Service, to the same Allowance as if he had continued to hold the vacated Appointment and at the same Rate of Salary as when the same was vacated, subject nevertheless to the Conditions which would in that Case have been applicable with respect to the Grant of such Allowance; provided that it shall be lawful for the Commissioners of the Treasury, in the Case of Officers transferred to Governorships and Lieutenant-Governorships of Colonies, and other high Offices abroad, conferred for a limited Period, to grant such Superannuation Allowance to such Officers on the Expiration of such Term of Service without a Renewal of Public Employment; but any Officer to whom such Grant is made while under the Age of Sixty Years shall be subject to the same Liability to be called upon to fill Office under the Crown, as herein provided concerning other Persons under that Age to whom like Allowances are granted.

[Orders, &c. within what Time to be laid before Parliament.

XIII. All Orders, Warrants, and Minutes by this Act directed to be laid before Parliament shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within Fourteen Days after the making thereof if Parliament be sitting, and if Parliament be not sitting then within Fourteen Days after the next Meeting thereof.

[Acts in Schedu;e to be construed as referring to this Act.]

XV. The several Sections mentioned in the Schedule hereto

of the several Acts of Parliament, also therein mentioned, shall be construed as if this Act, instead of the said Act of the Fourth and Fifth Years of the Reign of King William the Fourth, had been referred to in the said Sections; and such other Enactments as refer to the Scale of Superannuation Allowance established by the Provisions hereby repealed of the said Act of King William the Fourth shall be construed as if the Scale established by this Act had been referred to.

[Allowances to be paid free from Taxes.]

XVI. All Superannuations, Compensations, Gratuities, and other Allowances granted or hereafter under this Act to be granted shall be paid to the Persons entitled to receive the same without any Abatement or Deduction in respect of any Taxes or Duties whatever at present existing, except the Tax upon Property or Income.

[Who to be deemed Civil Servants.]

XVII. For the Purposes of this Act, no Person hereafter to be appointed shall be deemed to have served in the permanent Civil Service of the State unless such Person holds his Appointment directly from the Crown, or has been admitted into the Civil Service with a Certificate from the Civil Service Commissioners; nor shall any Person already appointed to any Office be held to have served in the permanent Civil Service as aforesaid, unless such Person belong to a Class which is already entitled to Superannuation Allowance, or to a Class in which if he had been appointed thereto subsequently to the passing of this Act, he

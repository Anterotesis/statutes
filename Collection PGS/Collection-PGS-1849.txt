That if Part only of any Lands comprised in a Lease for a Term of Years unexpired shall be conveyed or agreed to be conveyed for the Purposes of the Baid firstly herein-before mentioned Act, the Rent payable in respect of the Lands comprised in such Lease, and any Fine certain or fixed Sum of Money to be paid upon any Renewals thereof, or either of such Payments, may be apportioned between the Part of the said Land so conveyed or agreed to be conveyed and the Residue thereof; and such Apportionment may be settled by Agreement between the Parties following, that is to say, the Lessor or other the Owner subject to such Lease of the Lands comprised therein, the Lessee or other the Party entitled thereto by .virtue of such Lease or any Assignment thereof for the Residue of the Term thereby created, and the Party to whom such Conveyance as aforesaid for the Purposes of the said firstly herein-before mentioned Act is made or agreed to be made; and when such Apportionment shall so be made it shall be binding on all Underlessees and other Persons and Corporations whatsoever, whether Parties to the said Agreement or not.

4 mand Bridewell and the Richmond Female Penitentiary, it is ' expedient to augment the Sums which the Grand Juries of the said County of the City of Dublin are authorized to present annually as a Recompence for the Services of the ' Chaplains of the said Prisons: And whereas the Number of Prisoners professing the Roman Catholic Religion in each

of the said Gaols is so considerable as to require the entire Services of a Roman Catholic Clergyman wholly unconnected 1 with the Discharge of any other ecclesiastical or parochial Duties: ' Be it therefore enacted. That from and after the passing of this Act it shall and may be lawful to and for the Grand Jury of the County of the City of Dublin, at each Easter and Michaelmas Term, to present a Sum not exceeding the Sum of Fifty Pounds Sterling as and for the Salary of each of the Roman Catholic Chaplains of the Richmond Bridewell and Richmond Female Penitentiary^ provided it shall fully appear to the said Grand Jury and to the Court that such Chaplain has devoted his entire Time to the Duties of such Office during the preceding Half Year, and duly and regularly discharged the several Duties of his Office; and that it shall be lawful to and for the said Grand Jury of the County of the City of Dublin, at each Easter and Michaelmas Term, to present a Sum not exceeding the Sum of Twenty-five Pounds as and for the Salary of the Protestant Chaplains of each of the said Prisons, and a Sum not exceeding the Sum of Sixteen Pounds Thirteen Shillings and Four-pence as and for the Salary of the Protestant Dissenting Chaplains of each of the said Prisons, provided it shall appear to the said Grand Jury and to the Court that such Chaplains have duly and regularly executed the several Duties of their Offices; and provided also, that it shall not be lawful for any Grand Jury to present any Salary for any such Chaplain as aforesaid, if it shall appear to them that such Chaplain is interdicted or prohibited from exercising the Functions of his Office either by the Rules of the Church to which he belongs or by any other competent Authority.

County of the City of Dublin at large, instead of the Parish

or Portion of a Parish where such Arrears became due: * Be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Grand Jury of the said County of the City of Dublin, at the Presenting Term next after the passing of this Act, or, in case the same shall not then be done, at the Presenting Term next after, to ascertain, by such Ways and Means as to them shall seem fit, the Particulars and Amount of insolvent Arrears of Grand Jury Cess then remaining due and unpaid by the several Parishes of the said County of the City of Dublin, and to present and assess the Amount of such insolvent Arrears so ascertained upon the several Parishes or Portions thereof in the County of the City of Dublin, according and in proportion to their respective Valuation in the general Valuation or Assessment returned to the Treasurer of the Levy of the City of Dublin under the Act passed in the First and Second Years of the Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act to amend the Laws relating to the Levy of Grand Jury Cess in the County of the City of Dublin, which Sums so presented shall be chargeable, payable, and recoverable in the same Manner as the other Sums presented at the said Term.

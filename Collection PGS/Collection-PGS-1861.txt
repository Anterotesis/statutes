Parliament of England, made in the Thirty-first Year of the Reign of King Charles the ' Second, for granting a Supply to His Majesty of Two hundred and six thousand four

banding the Forces, it is declared and enacted, that no Officer, Civil or Military, nor other

Person whosoever, should thenceforth presume to place, quarter, or billet any Soldier

upon any Subject or Inhabitant of this Realm, of any Degree, Quality, or Profession ' whatsoever, without his Consent, and that it shall be lawful for any Subject or Inhabitant ' to refuse to quarter any Soldier, notwithstanding any Warrant or Billeting whatsoever:

such Time as he or they should be and remain in some Seaport Town or other Place in

the Neighbourhood of a Seaport Town in order to be transported, or during such Time as

there should be any Commotion in any Part of Ireland, by reason of which Emergency

the Army, or any considerable Part thereof, should be commanded to march from One ' Part of Ireland to another:' But forasmuch as there is and may be Occasion for the marching and quartering of Regiments, Corps, Troops, and Companies in several Parts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the said several Provisions of the said recited Acts shall be suspended and cease to be of any Force or Effect during the Continuance of this Act.

61. ' And whereas by the Eleventh Section of the said Act of the Sixth Year of the

Reign of Queen Anne, Chapter Fourteen, it is provided and enacted, that no Civil

Magistrate or Constable should be obliged to find Quarters for or give Billets to more or

other Soldiers than those only whose true Christian and Surnames should be delivered

to him in Writing under the Hand of the Officer desiring Quarters or Billets for such

Soldiers at the Time such Quarters or Billets should be desired, and that all such Names

should be written together and delivered in One Piece of Paper, signed as aforesaid, and

' ' King George the Second, and intituled An Act to restrain the Disposition of Lands

whereby the same become inalienable,it was amongst other things enacted, that no Lands or

other Hereditaments should be given, granted, or anyways conveyed, settled, or charged for

Charitable Uses, unless such Gift, Conveyance, or Settlement should be made by Deed

indented and enrolled, sealed and delivered in the Presence of Two or more credible

Witnesses Twelve Calendar Months at least before the Death of such Donor or Grantor,

and should be enrolled in the High Court of Chancery within Six Calendar Months next ( after the Execution thereof, and unless the same should be made to take effect in possession

for the Charitable Use intended immediately from the making thereof, and should be without

any Power of Revocation, Reservation, Trust, Condition, Limitation, Clause, or Agreement

whatsoever for the Benefit of the Donor or Grantor, or of anyPerson claiming under him:

And whereas by another Act passed in the Ninth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty

King George the Fourth, and intituled An Act for remedying a Defect in the Titles of

Lands purchased for Charitable Purposes, it was enacted, that where any Lands, Tenements,

or Hereditaments had been purchased for a full and valuable Consideration for Charitable

Uses, and such Consideration had been actually paid, every Deed or other Assurance then

already made for the Purpose of conveying or assuring the same should (subject as in the

now-reciting Act mentioned) be as good and valid in all respects as if the several Formalities

by the said first-recited Act prescribed had been duly observed and performed: And

whereas Doubts have been entertained with reference to the Assurance for Charitable

Uses of Hereditaments of Copyhold or Customary Tenure: And whereas it is expedient

to make Provision for further remedying Defects and obviating Doubts and Difficulties,

Whereas the Public Health Act, 1848, has been duly applied to the Borough of Preston in the County of Lancaster, and the said-Act and the Local Government Act, 1858, are respectively in force within and for the District of Preston aforesaid.

And whereas the said Local Board of Health received authority from the General Board of Health, under the Public Health Act, 1848, to borrow a sum of 55,000/. on mortgage of the Special District Rates of the Township of Preston, which Township forms a portion of the aforesaid District, and have borrowed under such authority sums amounting in the whole to 34,850/. for the Main Drainage of such Township, and the remaining portion of the first herein-before mentioned sum of 55,000/. will be required to complete such works.

And whereas also, under the herein-before recited Acts, the said Local Board must repay the money borrowed for such works, with all interest thereon, within a period of thirty years from the date of the borrowing of such money.

And whereas the said Local Board of Health have further borrowed, on mortgage of the Rates authorized to be made under the Preston Waterworks Act, 1853, the sum of 135,225/. to defray the cost of purchasing from the Preston Waterworks Company their undertaking, and the further sum of 80,000/., that being the full amount, above and exclusive of the herein-before mentioned purchase money, which the said Local Board are authorized to borrow under the Preston Waterworks Act aforesaid.

And whereas by that Act the said Local Board are required, in order to pay off any monies borrowed under it, to set aside in every year, from and after the expiration of five years from the passing of such Act, not less than 1,600/. as a sinking fund to be applied in paying off such monies.

And whereas the said several sums borrowed under the said Preston Waterworks Act are not sufficient to enable the said Local Board of Health to complete the Works necessary for supplying the said Borough with water, and a further sum will be required for the completion of such Works; but such further sum, with that already borrowed under the authority of the said Act, and under the authority of the Public Health Act, 1848, exceed the amount authorized to be borrowed by the several herein-before recited Acts.

And whereas the said Local Board have now, under the authority of the 78th section of the Local Government Act, 1858, petitioned me, as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, that the time allowed for the repayment of loans borrowed or to be borrowed on account of the Main Drainage Works within the aforesaid district of Preston may be extended from thirty to fifty years; that the time provided and fixed by the Preston Waterworks Act, 1853, (sec. 56,) for the commencement of a sinking fund to be applied under the provisions of that Act in paying off the money borrowed or to be borrowed on account of the waterworks of the aforesaid District, may be extended; and that the said Local Board may be empowered to borrow (for the completion of the Works for supplying water to Such District), on mortgage of the Waterworks and Water Rates under the provisions of the Preston Waterworks Act, 1853, and of the rates leviable by the Preston

And whereas, after due inquiry and report by William Banger esquire, the inspector appointed by me for the purpose, I am of opinion that the prayer of such petition should be granted; but the same cannot be done without the consent of Parliament.

Now, therefore, in pursuance of the powers now vested in me as one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State as aforesaid, I do hereby, by this Provisional Order under my hand, direct as follows: —

tained whether Grants of Gales conferred more than Estates for Life or for some other

partial Interest; but inasmuch as it has been commonly supposed that such Grants enured

An Act to remove Doubts respecting the Authority of the Legislature of Queensland, and to annex certain Territories to the Colony of South Australia, and for other Purposes. [22d July 1861.]

WHEREAS by an Act passed in the Session of Parliament holden in the Fifth and

" Sixth Years of Her Majesty, intituled An Act for the Government of New South ' Wales and Van Diemen's Land, it was enacted that it should be lawful for Her Majesty,

by Letters Patent to be from Time to Time issued under the Great Seal of the United ' Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to define, as to Her Majesty should seem fit, the

Limits of the Colony of New South Wales, and to erect into a separate Colony or Colonies

any Territories which then were or were reputed to be or thereafter might be comprised ( within the said Colony of New South Wales provided always, that no Part of the Terri-

torics lying Southward of the Twenty-sixth Degree of South Latitude in the said Colony

should by any such Letters Patent be detached from the said Colony: And whereas by a

Bill passed by the Legislative Council of New South Wales, in the Seventeenth Year of ' Her Majesty, intituled An Act to confer a Constitution upon New South Wales, and to

grant a Civil List to Her Majesty, which said Act was, with certain Amendments, assented

to by Her Majesty in Council under Authority of an Act of Parliament passed in the ' Session holden in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Year of Her said Majesty, intituled ' An Act to enable Her Majesty to assent to a Bill as amended of the Legislature of New 1 South Wales to confer a Constitution upon New South Wales, and to grant a Civil List

to Her Majesty, it was provided that nothing in the said Bill contained should be deemed ' to prevent Her Majesty from altering the Boundary of New South Wales on the North f in such Manner as to Her Majesty might seem fit, nor from detaching, from the said ' Colony that Portion of the same which lies between the Western Boundary of South ' Australia and the One hundred and twenty-ninth Degree of East Longitude, reckoning ' from the Meridian of Greenwich: And whereas by the last-recited Act of Parliament ' Provision was made respecting the Exercise by Her Majesty of the Power given Her by ' the said Bill of altering the Northern Boundary of New South Wales and it was declared ' that it should be lawful for Her Majesty, by Letters Patent to be from Time to Time r issued under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to E erect into a separate Colony or Colonies any Territories which might be separated from ' New South Wales by such Alteration as aforesaid of the Northern Boundary thereof, and r in and by such Letters Patent or by Order in Council to make Provision for the Govern- ment of any such Colony, and for the Establishment of a Legislature therein in manner as ' nearly resembling the Form of Government and Legislature which should be at such Time

established in New South Wales as the Circumstances of such Colony would allow, and that: full Power should be given in and by such Letters Patent or Order in Council to the Legislature of the said Colony to make further Provision in that Behalf: And whereas in: virtue of the Powers herein-before set forth Her Majesty did, by certain Letters Patent bearing Date the Sixth Day of June in the Year One thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, separate certain Territories therein mentioned from the Colony of New South Wales, and did erect the said Territories into a separate Colony under the Name of Queensland, and did also, by a certain Order in Council, also bearing Date the said Sixth Day of June One thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, make Provision for the Government of the said Colony of Queensland, and for the Establishment of a Legislature therein, but the Form of Government and Legislature so established did not in all respects resemble the Form of Government and Legislature at that Time established in South Wales: And whereas Doubts are entertained whether the Powers intended to be conferred upon the said Government and Legislature by the said Order in Council, and the Acts done by them, may not be invalid by reason of such Want of Resemblance as aforesaid: And whereas Doubts are also entertained whether it is competent to Her Majesty by Letters Patent to annex to any existing Colony any Part of New South Wales which may be detached therefrom, or to detach from New South Wales that Portion thereof which lies between the Western Boundary of South Australia and the One hundred and twenty-ninth Degree

of

187

24" & 25" VICTORIA, c. 44.

of East Longitude: And whereas it is expedient to set at rest all such Doubts as aforesaid,

and also to detach from New South Wales the last-mentioned Portion thereof, and to

annex the same to South Australia: ' Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

L So much of the Colony of New South Wales, being to the South of the Twenty-sixth Certain Ter-Degree of South Latitude, os lies between the Western Boundary of South Australia and the One hundred and twenty-ninth Degree of East Longitude, shall be and the same is j$eW South' hereby detached from the Colony of New South Wales and annexed to the Colony of South Wales and an-Australia, and shall for all Purposes whatever be deemed to be Part of the said last- Soulh

mentioned Colony from the Day on which this Act of Parliament shall be proclaimed 08

therein.

2. It shall be lawful for Her Majesty by such Letters Patent as aforesaid to annex to Power to an-any Colony which is now or may hereafter be established on the Continent of Australia any n« to existing Territories which, in exercise of the Powers herein-before mentioned, might have been ^riesnow* erected into a separate Colony: Provided always, that it shall be lawful for Her Majesty Part of New in such Letters Patent to reserve such Powers of revoking or altering the same as to Her South Wales. Majesty shall seem fit, or to declare the Period during which such Letters Patent shall remain in force; and also on the Revocation or other Determination of such Letters Patent again to exercise, in respect of the Territories referred to therein or any Part thereof, all such Powers and Authority as might have been exercised if the stud Letters Patent had never been made.

3. All the Provisions made in the afore-mentioned Letters Patent nnd Order in Council All Provisions of the said Sixth Day of June One thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, for establishing ^ofeS the Colony of Queensland, and for the Government of the said Colony, and for the 1859 and Pro-Establishment of a Legislature therein, shall be and be deemed to have been valid and ceedingstherc-cffectual for all Purposes whatever, and all Acts and Proceedings of the said Government

and Legislature shall be and be deemed to have been from the Date of the said Order in of Queensland Council of the same Force and Effect as if the last-mentioned Order in Council had been t* valid, in all respects valid and free from Doubt.

4. ' And whereas in the event of any Territories being hereafter separated from New Sect. 7. of ' South Wales, and erected into a separate Colony, it may not be expedient that the Form

' of the Government and Legislature to be established in the said Colony should depend ' ' *

upon the Form of Government and Legislature which may, at the Time of such Separation,

be established in New South Wales Be it enacted as follows:

So much of the secondly herein recited Act of Parliament as requires that the Government and'Legislature of any Colony so erected as aforesaid shall, as nearly as the Circumstances of the said Colony shall allow, resemble the Form of Government and Legislature which shall be at such Time established in New South Wales, shall be and the same is hereby repealed.

5. ' Whereas the Boundaries of certain of Her Majesty's Colonies on the Continent of Provision for ' Australia may be found to have been imperfectly or inconveniently defined, and it may be determining ' expedient from Time to Time to determine or alter such BoundariesBe it therefore Boundane8-further enacted as follows:

It shall be lawful from Time to Time for the Governors of any contiguous Colonies on the said Continent, with the Advice of their respective Executive Councils, by any Instrument under their joint Hands and Seals, to determine or alter the common Boundary of such Colonies; and the Boundary described in any such Instrument shall be deemed to be, within the Limits there laid down, the true Boundary of said Colonies, so soon as Her Majesty's Approval of such Instrument shall have been proclaimed in either of such Colonies by the Governor thereof.

4 the Local Turnpike Acts do not contain any Provisions for regulating the Use of

4 Locomotives on the Roads to which they respectively apply, nor do they authorize the

4 levying of Tolls upon or in respect of any Locomotive using the Roads, or upon or in

4 respect of any Waggon or Carriage drawn by Locomotives: And whereas under and by

4 virtue of certain Local Turnpike Acts Tolls may be levied upon Locomotives and other Engines drawing or propelling Waggons or Carriages, or upon the Waggons or Carriages so drawn or propelled, which are or may be prohibitory of the Use of Locomotives on die Roads to which the said Acts respectively apply: And whereas the Weighing Clauses in the General Turnpike Acts have not been framed in anticipation of Traffic by Locomotives, 4 and arc in many respects ill adapted to the profitable carrying of Goods, or to the levying of just and adequate Tolls upon Waggons or Carriages drawn by Locomotives: And whereas it is desirable that the Use of Locomotives on Turnpike and other Roads should be regulated by uniform general Provisions, and that Tolls should be levied upon such Locomotives and the Waggons or Carriages drawn by such Locomotives upon Turnpike RoadsBe it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

' the Possessions of the said College were insufficient to sustain the other Charges and also to bear the Charges of the same Knights (in consideration whereof His said Majesty King Edward the Fourth had for the said Knights otherwise provided), the said Knights were ' excluded from the said College, and the said Warden and Canons, who were thereby incorporated by the Title of the Dean and Canons," were discharged from the Charge of maintaining the said Knights: And whereas no permanent Provision was made for the said Knights by King Edward the Fourth, but subsequently thereto, and in the First Year of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, Trusts were created of certain Lands then vested c in the said Dean and Canons by virtue of a Conveyance thereof previously made, and by the Indenture creating such Trusts, after estimating the annual Value of such Lands at Six hundred and sixty-one Pounds Six Shillings and Eightpence, and stating it to have been the Intention of the Crown to whom the said Lands belonged to make by the First

Conveyance a special Foundation and Continuance of the said Knights, it was declared ' that Four hundred and thirty Pounds, Part of the Income of the said Lands, should be appropriated, amongst other things, to the Payment of Twelvepence per Day for the Maintenance of the said Knights, and to providing them with certain Liveries, to the Intent that they might make a decent Appearance before their Sovereign, while the Dean and Canons were authorized to apply to their own Use the Residue of the said Income,

amounting to Two hundred and thirty-one Pounds Six Shillings and Eightpence: And whereas the annual Income of the said Land has increased from the said Sum of Six 4 hundred and Sixty-one Pounds Six Shillings and Eightpence to about Fourteen thousand Pounds, but no Increase has been made in the Sums allowed to the said Knights: And whereas in pursuance of divers Acts of Parliament Eight Canonries in the said Collegiate Chapel of Saint George are suspended, and One Fourteenth Part of the whole Monies of the said Chapel are paid in respect of each suspended Canonry to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and carried over by them to their Common Fund: And whereas it is expedient that there should be made out of the Revenues of the suspended Canonries such Augmentation of the Salaries of the said Knights as would appear to be just, having regard to the Difference that has occurred in the Value of Money and in the annual

Income of the said Lands since the Trusts were created, apportioning such Income in manner herein-before mentioned: And whereas the Town of Windsor is very populous, 4 and insufficient Means are provided for the Cure of Souls therein; and it is expedient ' that out of other Part of the Revenues of the said suspended Canonries an Addition should be made to the Endowments of the Churches in WindsorBe it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:

L The Dean and Canons of Windsor shall henceforth retain all such Share of divisible Appropriation Revenues as would if this Act had not passed have been payable to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in respect of the Canonry seventhly suspended under the Acts herein-before Canonry to in that Behalf mentioned, and shall apply the same for the Benefit of the Military Knights Military on the Upper or Royal Foundation of the Castle at Windsor, in such Manner as Her Km^hte* Majesty may by Warrant under Her Sign Manual direct.

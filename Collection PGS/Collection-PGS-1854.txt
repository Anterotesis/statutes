Provisional Order for the Application of the Public Health Act to the Borough of Plymouth, in the County of Devon.

General Board of Health.

Whereas it having been ascertained from the last Return, for the time being, made up by the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, that the annual number of deaths in the Municipal Borough of Plymouth, in the County of Devon, has on an average of seven years exceeded during that period the proportion of twenty-three to a thousand of the population, due inquiry and report have been made under the Public Health Act, 1848, in that Borough.

v And whereas from such Report it appears that notwithstanding there is a Local Act in force in the said Borough, intituled " An Act for better paving, lighting, cleansing, wateh-u ing, and improving the Town and Borough of Plymouth, in " the County of Devon; and for regulating the Police thereof; " and for removing and preventing Nuisances and Annoyances " therein," the mortality of Plymouth is excessive, and that the real cause of this excessive mortality is to be found in the generally defective nature of the existing sanitary arrangements, and the divided jurisdiction exercised by the various public bodies; that this divided jurisdiction further causes unnecessary expense, and effectually prevents the carrying out of general and comprehensive measures; that the existing water supply requires improvement and extension; that the present sewerage and drainage is much too limited in extent; and that where sewers or house-drains are laid down, they are, in many cases, defective both in construction and arrangement; that the partial provisions made for either sewerage or house-drains have been carried out at various periods and in various ways, instead of on a combined and carefully arranged system, by which alone due efficiency can be secured, and that the present outfalls for the sewage are also highly prejudicial to health; that the present system of cleansing the streets and removing the house refuse is

imperfect;

305

General Board of Health. Cap. 53,

imperfect; that the existing burial-grounds are unduly crowded and ought to be closed, sufficient means of interment existing within a convenient distance; that many portions of the town are insufficiently lighted, particularly a great number of the courts and lanes occupied by the poorer classes; that it would be a means of health and comfort to all, but particularly the poorer classes of the Borough, if public baths and wash-houses were established.

And whereas the Public Health Act, 1848, contains provisions for consolidating local authority in corporate districts in the hands of the Town Council; for improving and extending water supply, and compelling such supply in houses where the expense does not exceed 2d. a week; for providing a general Survey on which sewerage and other works may be laid down on a comprehensive and economical plan; for providing an outfall for sewerage and carrying sewers where necessary through private property; for compelling the provision of house-drains and water-closets; the cleansing of unwholesome houses and streets; for regulating the breadth and levels of new streets; for closing burial grounds where sufficient means of interment exist within a convenient distance; for distributing the charge for permanent works over the period for which the works are likely to last, and for rating to the cost of such works those who are benefited thereby; for intrusting to the Local Board of Health the care and management of the roads; for lighting and other matters essential to the sanitary regulation of the district; and for providing for the repeal, alteration, extension, or further execution of Local Acts.

Now therefore, in pursuance of the power vested in us by the Public Health Act, 1848, we the said General Board of Health do, by this Provisional Order, under our hands and seal of office, direct:—-

That from and after the passing of any Act of Parliament confirming this Order,—

1.—" The Public Health Act, 1848/' and every part thereof relating to corporate districts, except the section numbered 50 in the copies of that Act printed by Her Majesty's

Erinters, Bhall apply to the area comprised within the oundaries of the said Borough of Plymouth.

2.—The sections of the Towns' Police Clauses Act, 1847, with respect to obstructions and nuisances in the streets, and with respect to fires, and with respect to places of public resort; and the sections of the Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847, with respect to naming the streets and numbering the houses, and with respect to improving the line of the streets and removing obstructions, and with respect to ruinous or dangerous buildings, and with respect to precautions during the construction and repair of sewers, streets, and houses; and the sections with respect to the prevention of nuisances numbered 104 [No. 20. Price 2*£] U and

Haworth in the West Riding of the County of York, as constituted for the purposes of the Public Health Act, 1848.

General Board of Health.

Whereas, by Order of Her Most Gracious Majesty in Council, bearing date the 23d day of October 1851, made under the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1848, the said Public Health Act was duly applied to the District of Haworth, in the West Riding of the County of York.

And whereas the said General Board have, in pursuance of the provisions of the said Act, directed William Ranger, a Superintending Inspector appointed for the purposes of that Act, to visit the said District, and to make further public inquiry, and to examine witnesses as to the altered boundaries which might most advantageously be adopted for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, having previously given the notices directed by the said Act, proceeded upon the said further inquiry in the manner directed by the said

ABERDARE.

Provisional Order for the Application of the Public Health Act, 1848, to the Parish of Aberdare, in the County of Glamorgan.

General Board of Health.

Whereas it having been ascertained from the last return for the time being, made up by the Registrar-General of Births,

Deaths

313

1854. General Board of Health. Cap. 53.

Deaths, and Marriages, that the annual number of deaths within the boundaries of the Parish of Aberdare, in the County of Glamorgan, has on the average of seven years exceeded the proportion of twenty-three to a thousand of the population of such Parish, the General Board of Health directed Thomas Webster Rammell, one of their Superintending Inspectors, to visit the said Parish, and to make public inquiry, and to examine witnesses as to the sewerage, drainage, and supply of water, the state of the burial grounds, the number and sanitary condition of the inhabitants, and as to any Local Acts of Parliament in force within the said Parish for paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, regulating, supplying with water, or improving the said Parish, or having relation to the purposes of the said Act; also, as to the natural drainage areas, and the existing parochial or other local boundaries, and the boundaries which might be most advantageously adopted for the purposes of the said Act

And whereas the said Superintending Inspector, having previously given the notices required by the said Act, proceeded upon the said inquiry in the manner directed by the said Act, and hath reported in writing to the said General Board upon the several matters with respect to which he was so directed to inquire as aforesaid, and upon certain other matters in respect of which he deemed it expedient to report for the purposes of the said Act.

And whereas copies of the said Report, accompanied by a notice stating that, within the time directed by the said Act, written statements might be forwarded to the said Board with respect to any matter contained in or omitted from the said Report, or any amendment proposed to be made therein, have been duly published and deposited as required by the said Act, and the time for forwarding such statements has now elapsed, and no such statements have been received by the said Board.

And whereas it appears upon such Report that there is a certain Local Act in force within the said Parish having relation to the purposes of the said Public Health Act; that is to say.

An Act passed in the Fifteenth Year of the Reign of Her present Majesty Queen Victoria, intituled " An " Act for establishing a Market, and for providing a " Market House and Slaughter-houses, at Aberdare, in " the County of Glamorgan."

And whereas from such Report it appears,—

1. That the population of Aberdare has rapidly increased of late years, and is still increasing with greater rapidity than at any period heretofore.

2. That there are no Local Acts in force (with the exception of a Market Act,) nor any powers for providing for the sanitary requirements of the place, or the comfort and convenience of the inhabitants.

3. That being situate in a valley, at the confluence of two rivers, the site is occasionally subject to floods.

4. That

314

Cap. 53. General Board of Health. 17 & 18 VICT.

4. That there is no provision for drainage, and great deficiency of privy accommodation; and that the inhabitants, for want of such provisions, are forced to resort to the most offensive expedients in disposing of their refuse; the greater portion of it being cast upon spots of waste ground, and the public streets and thoroughfares, where it accumulates in heaps and stagnant pools.

5. That there is no public provision for water supply, the major part of the inhabitants resorting to certain springs or spouts, some of which yield water of impure quality; that the labour and loss of time incurred in procuring a supply of this water are so great as to amount to a serious evil; and that, as the population of the place goes on increasing, this evil must increase also, unless some timely provision be made.

6. That the houses of the working classes, from the causes above cited, and from their being crowded closely together and ill-ventilated, are generally very unhealthy and comfortless abodes.

7. That the sanitary condition of the place is very bad, fevers and other zymotic diseases being continuously present; that the deaths from these causes, and of young subjects, are far beyond the average even in manufacturing districts.

8. That the roads are in a state requiring improvement.

9. That although a gas company exists, there is no public lighting

10. That there is one burial ground attached to the parish church, which is very old, and now quite full; but that further burial accommodation, to the extent of eleven acres, in connexion with the Established Church, will shortly be available; but there are thirteen small burial grounds attached to dissenting chapels of various denominations, many of which, from their condition, and from the position in proximity to dwellings, it would be desirable to close.

11. That the comfort and health of the inhabitants would be promoted and their condition improved, by—

a. Drainage of the subsoil in parts.

b. A complete system of refuse drainage.

c. Proper privy accommodation.

d. An abundant supply of pure water.

e. Improved ventilation in the dwellings of the working

classes.

f. Improvement in the state of the roads.

g. Lighting of the public streets.

h. The closing of some of the existing burial grounds,

and the provision of adequate burial accommodation in their stead.

And whereas it appears to the said General Board to be expedient that the said Public Health Act should be applied

to

315

1854. General Board of Health. Cap. 53.

to the said Parish; but the same cannot be done without the authority of Parliament.

Now therefore, in pursuance of the powers vested in the said Board by the Public Health Act, 1848, We, the said General Board of Health, do, by this Provisional Order under our hands and official seal, direct, That from and after the day appointed for the first election of the Local Board of Health by any Act of Parliament confirming this Order:—

1. —The Public Health Act, and every part thereof, except the

Section numbered 50 in the copies of that Act printed by Her Majesty's Printers, shall apply to the Parish of Aberdare, in the County of Glamorgan.

2. —The Local Board of Health for the said Parish shall consist

of twelve persons, all of whom shall be elected for the whole of the said Parish.

3. —One-third in number of the said Local Board shall go out of

office on the day next after the expiration of a year from the day appointed by Parliament for the first election of the said Local Board, and so on annually.

4. —Every person shall, when elected, and while he continues

a member of the said Local Board, be resident, as in the Public Health Act, 1848, is required, and be possessed of real or personal estate, or both, to the amount of not less than five hundred pounds, or shall be so resident and rated to the relief of the poor of the said Parish, or of some township or place of winch some part is within the said district, upon an annual value of not less than twenty-five pounds.

5. —At the first election of the said Local Board, the Reverend

John Griffith, Vicar of Aberdare, shall perform the duties which it may be requisite for him to perform in conducting the said first election; and in case the said John Griffith, from illness or other sufficient cause, shall be unable to discharge such duties, or shall be absent, or shall refuse to act, then David Davies, Coal Proprietor, Blaen Gwawr, Aberdare, shall perform such of the said duties as then remain to be performed.

6. —The fourteen days notice of qualification required by the

Public Health Act, 1848, to be given by owners of property in order to entitle them to vote at the said first election shall be given to the said John Griffith, at his residence, the Vicarage, Aberdare; or in case he shall refuse or be unable to receive the same, then to the aforesaid David Davies, at his residence, Blaen Gwawr, Aberdare.

Measurement of Tonnage.

XX. Throughout the following Rules the Tonnage Deck shall be taken to be the Upper Deck in Ships which have less than Three Decks, and to be the Second Deck from below in

all

1854 Merchant Shipping (Part II. Registry.) Cap. 104. 591

all other Ships; and in carrying such Rules into effect all Measurement of Measurements shall be taken in Feet and Fractions of Feet, Tonnage. and all Fractions of Feet shall be expressed in Decimals.

XXI. The Tonnage of every Ship to be registered, with the Bulb L Exceptions mentioned in the next Section, shall previously to For s- ^ ^ her being registered, be ascertained by the following Rule, registered and herein-after called Rule L; and the Tonnage of every Ship to other Ships of which such Rule can be applied, whether she is about to be Hold

registered or not, shall be ascertained by the same Rule:

(1.) Measure the Length of the Ship in a straight Line Lengtba-along the upper Side of the Tonnage Deck from the Inside of the inner Plank ^average Thickness,) at the Side of the Stem to the Inside of the Midship Stern Timber or Plank there, as the Case may be, (average Thickness,) deducting from this Length what is due to the Rake of the Bow in the Thickness of the Deck, and what is due to the Rake of the Stem Timber in the Thickness of the Deck, and also what is due to the Rake of the Stem Timber in One Third of the Round of the Beam; divide the Length so taken into the Number of equal Parts required by the following Table according to the Class in such Table to which the Ship belongs:

Table.

Class 1. Ships of which the Tonnage Deck is according to the above Measurement 50 Feet long or under, into 4 equal Parts:

,, 2. Ships of which the Tonnage Deck is according to the above Measurement above 50 Feet long and not exceeding 120, into 6 equal Parts:

,, 3. Ships of which the Tonnage Deck is according to the above Measurement above 120 Feet long and not exceeding 180, into 8 equal Parts:

, 4, Ships of which the Tonnage Deck is according to the above Measurement above 180 Feet long and not exceeding 225, into 10 equal Parts:

,• 5. Ships of which the Tonnage Deck is according to the above Measurement above 225 Feet long, into 12 equal Parts:

(2.) Then, the Hold being first sufficiently cleared to admit Transverse of the required Depths and Breadths being properly taken, Areaa* find the Transverse Area of such Ship at each Point of Division of the Length as follows:—Measure the Depth at each Point of Division, from a Point at a Distance of One Third of the Round of the Beam below such Deck,

• or, in case of a Break, below a Line stretched in continuation thereof, to the upper Side of the Floor Timber at the Inside of the Limber Strake, after deducting the average Thickness of the Ceiling which is between the Bilge Planks and Limber Strake; then, if the Depth at the Midship Division of the Length do not exceed Sixteen

Feet,

Feet, divide each Depth into Four equal Parte; then measure the inside horizontal Breadth at each of the Three Points of Division, and also at the upper and lower Points of the Depth, extending each Measurement to the average Thickness of that Part of the Ceiling which is between the Points of Measurement; number these Breadths from above (t. e. numbering the upper Breadth One, and so on down to the lowest Breadth); multiply the Second and Fourth by Four, and the Third by Two; add these Products together, and to the Sum add the First Breadth and the Fifth; multiply the Quantity thus obtained by One Third of the common Interval between the Breadths, and the Product shall be deemed the Transverse Area; but if the Midship Depth exceed Sixteen Feet, divide each Depth into Six equal Parts instead of Four, and measure as before directed the horizontal Breadths at the Five Points of Division, and also at the upper and lower Points of the Depth; number them from above as before; multiply the Second, Fourth, and Sixth by Four, and the Third and Fifth by Two; add these Products together, and to the Sum add the First Breadth and the Seventh; multiply the Quantity thus obtained by One Third of the common Interval between the Breadths, and the Product shall be deemed the Tranverse Area.

(3.) Havingthus ascertained the Transverse Area at each Point of Division of the Length of the Ship as required by the above Table, proceed to ascertain the Register Tonnage of the Ship in the following Manner:—Number the Areas successively 1, 2, 3, &c., No. 1 being at the extreme Limit of the Length at the Bow, and the last No. at the extreme Limit of the Length at the Stern; then, whether the Length be divided according to the Table into Four or Twelve Parts as in Classes 1 and 5, or any intermediate Number as in Classes 2, 3, and 4, multiply the Second and every even numbered Area by Four, and the Third and every odd numbered Area (except the First and Last) by Two; add these Products together, and to the Sum add the First and Last if they yield anything; multiply the Quantity thus obtained by One Third of the common Interval between , the Areas, and the Product will be the Cubical Contents of the Space under the Tonnage Deck; divide this Product by One hundred, and the Quotient being the Tonnage under the Tonnage Deck shall be deemed to be the Register Tonnage of the Ship, subject to the Additions and Deductions herein-after mentioned.

(4.) If there be a Break, a Poop, or any other permanent closed-in Space on the upper Deck, available for Cargo or Stores, or for the Berthing or Accommodation of Passengers or Crew, the Tonnage of such Space shall be ascertained as follows:—Measure the internal mean Length of such Space in Feet, and divide it into Two equal Parts; measure

at

593

at the Middle of its Height Three inside Breadths, namely, Measurement One at each End and the other at the Middle of the Length; onna9e* then to the Sum of the End Breadths add Four Times the Middle Breadth, and multiply the whole Sum by One Third of the common Interval between the Breadths; the Product will give the mean horizontal Area of such Space; then measure the mean Height, and multiply it by the mean horizontal Area; divide the Product by One hundred, and the Quotient shall be deemed to be the Tonnage of such Space, and shall be added to the Tonnage under the Tonnage Deck, ascertained as aforesaid, subject to the following Provisoes; first, that nothing shall be added for a closed-in Space solely appropriated to the berthing of the Crew unless such Space exceeds One Twentieth of the remaining Tonnage of the Ship, and in case of such Excess the Excess only shall be added; and, secondly, that nothing shall be added in respect of any Building erected for the Shelter of Deck Passengers, and approved by the Board of Trade.

(5.) If the Ship has a Third Deck, commonly called a Spar In case of Two Deck, the Tonnage of the Space between it and the Ton- or more Deckj* nage Deck shall be ascertained as follows:—Measure in Feet the inside Length of the Space at the Middle of its Height from the Plank at the Side of the Stem to the Lining on the Timbers at the Stern, and divide the Length into the same Number of equal Parts into which the Length of the Tonnage Deck is divided as above directed; measure (also at the Middle of its Height) the inside Breadth of the Space at each of the Points of Division, also the Breadth' of the Stem and the Breadth at the Stern; number them successively 1, 2, 3, &c., commencing at the Stem; multiply the Second and all the other even numbered Breadths by Four, and the Third and all the other odd numbered Breadths (except the First and Last) by Two; to the Sum of these Products add the First and Last Breadths; multiply the whole Sum bv One Third of the common Interval between the Breadtns, and the Result will give in Superficial Feet the mean horizontal Area of such Space; measure the mean Height of such Space, and multiply by it the mean horizontal Area, and the Product will be the Cubical Contents of the Space; divide this Product " by One hundred, and the Quotient shall be deemed to be the Tonnage of such Space, and shall be added to the other Tonnage of the Ship ascertained as aforesaid; and if the Ship has more than Three Decks, the Tonnage of each Space between Decks above the Tonnage Deck shall be severally ascertained in manner above described, and shall be added to the Tonnage of the Ship ascertained as aforesaid.

(1.) Measure the Length on the Upper Deck from the Outside of the outer Plank at the Stem to the Aftaide of the Stem Post, deducting therefrom the Distance between the Aftside of the Stem Post and the Rabbet of the Stem Post at the Point where the Counter Plank crosses it; measure also the greatest Breadth of the Ship to the Outside of the outer Planking or Wales, and then, having first marked on the Outside of the Ship on both Sides thereof the Height of the Upper Deck at the Ship's Sides, girt the Ship at the greatest Breadth in a Direction perpendicular to the Keel from the Height so marked on the Outside of the Ship on the one Side to the Height so marked on the other Side by passing a Chain under the Keel; to Half the Qirth thus taken add Half the main Breadth; square the Sum; multiply the Result by the Length of the Ship taken as aforesaid; then multiply this Product by the Factor *0018 (Eighteen Ten-thousandths) in the Case of Ships built of Wood, and by *0021 (Twenty-one Ten-thousandths) in the Case of Ships built of Iron, and the Product shall be deemed the Register Tonnage of the Ship subject to the Additions and Deductions herein-afrer mentioned.

(2.) If there be a Break, a Poop, or other closed-in Space on the Upper Deck, the Tonnage of such Space shall be . ascertained by multiplying together the mean Length, Breadth, and Depth of such Space, and dividing the Product by 100, and the Quotient so obtained shall be deemed to be the Tonnage of such Space, and shall, subject to the Deduction for a closed-in Space appropriated to the Crew as mentioned in Rule I., be added to the Tonnage of the Ship ascertained as aforesaid.

XXIII. In every Ship propelled by Steam or other Power requiring Engine Room, an Allowance shall be made for the Space occupied by the propelling Power, and the Amount so allowed shall be deducted from the gross Tonnage of the Ship ascertained as aforesaid, and the Remainder shall be deemed to be the Register Tonnage of such Ship > and such Deduction shall be estimated as follows; (that is to say,)

(a.) As regards Ships propelled by Paddle Wheels in which the Tonnage of the Space solely oocupied by and necessary for the proper working of the Boilers and Machinery is above Twenty per Cent. and under Thirty per Cent. of the gross Tonnage of the Ship, such Deduction shall be Thirty-seven One-hundredths of such gross Tonnage; and in Ships propelled by Screws in which die Tonnage of such Space is above Thirteen per Cent and under Twenty per Cent. of such gross Tonnage, such Deduction shall be Thirty-two One-hundredths of such gross Tonnage:

(5.) As regards all other Ships, the Deduction shall, if the Commissioners of Customs and the Owner both agree thereto,

be

1854 Merchant Shipping (Part IL Registry). Cap. 104. 595

be estimated in the same Manner; but either they or he Measurement of may in their or his Discretion require the Space to be measured Tonnage.

and the Deduction estimated accordingly; and whenever such unusually Measurement is so required the Deduction shall consist of large or small the Tonnage of the Space actually occupied by or required to be inclosed for the proper Working of the Boilers and Machinery, with the Addition in the Case of Ships propelled by Paddle Wheels of One Half, and in the Case of Ships propelled by Screws of Three Fourths of the Tonnage of such Space; and the Measurement and Use of such Space shall be governed by the following Buies; (that is to say,)

(1.) Measure the mean Depth of the Space from its Crown Mode of Mea-to the Ceiling at the Limber Strake, measure also Three, or, 8uremeDt if necessary, more than Three Breadths of the Space at the Middle of its Depth, taking One of such Measurements at each End, and another at the Middle of the Length; take the Mean of such Breadths; measure also the mean Length of the Space between the foremost and aftermost Bulkheads or Limits of its Length, excluding such Parts, if any, as are not actually occupied by or required for the proper Working of the Machinery; multiply together these Three Dimensions of Length, Breadth, and Depth, and the Product will be the Cubical Contents of the Space below the Crown; then find the Cubical Contents of the Space or Spaces, if any, above the Crown aforesaid, which are framed in for the Machinery or for the Admission of Light and Air, by multiplying together the Length, Depth, and Breadth thereof; add such Contents to the Cubical Contents of the Space below the Crown; divide the Sum by 100; and the Besult shall be demeed to be the Tonnage of the said Space:

(2.) If m any Ship in which the Space aforesaid is to be <*** of measured the Engines and Boilers are fitted in separate Compartments, the Contents of each shall be measured severally in like Manner, according to the above Buies, and the Sum of their several Besults snail be deemed to be the Tonnage of the said Space:

(3.) In the Case of Screw Steamers in which the Space afore- Shaft Trunk said is to be measured, the Contents of the Shaft Trunk shall be added to and deemed to form Part of such Space, and shall be ascertained by multiplying together the mean Length, Breadth, and Depth of the Trunk, and dividing the Product by 100:

(4.) If in any Ship in which the Space aforesaid is to be Alteration of measured any Alteration be made in the Length or Capacity Room, of such Space, or if any Cabins be fitted in such Space, such Ship shall be deemed to be a Ship not registered until Bemea8urement«

(5.) If in any Ship in which the Space aforesaid is to be Penalty for measured any Goods or Stores are stowed or carried in such carrying Space, the Master and Owner shall each be liable to a Penalty not exceeding One hundred Pounds.

In every registered British Ship the Number denoting the Register Tonnage, ascertained as herein-before directed, and the Number of her Certificate of Registry, shall be deeply carved or otherwise permanently marked on her Main Beam, and shall be so continued; and if it at any Time cease to be so continued such Ship shall no longer be recognized as a British Ship.

XX VI. Whenever the Tonnage of any Ship has been ascertained and registered in accordance with the Provisions of this Act, the same shall thenceforth be deemed to be the Tonnage of such Ship, and be repeated in every subsequent Registry thereof, unless any Alteration is made in the Form or Capacity of such Ship, or unless it is discovered that the Tonnage of suck Ship has been erroneously computed; and in either of such Cases such Ship shall be remeasured, and her Tonnage determined and registered according to the Rules herein-before contained in that Behalf.

XXVII. The Rules for the Measurement of Tonnage herein contained shall not make it necessary to alter the present registered Tonnage of any British Ship registered before this Act comes into operation; but if the Owner of any such Ship desires to have the same remeasured, according to such Rules, he thay apply to the Commissioners of Customs for the Purposes and such Commissioners shall thereupon, and on Payment of such reasonable Charge for the Expenses of Remeasurement, not exceeding the Sum of Seven Shillings and Sixpence for each Transverse Section, as they may authorize, direct such Remeasurement to be made, and such Ship shall thereupon be remeasured according to such Rules as aforesaid, or according to such of them as may be applicable; and the Number denoting the Register Tonnage shall be altered accordingly.

XXVIII. If it appears to the Commissioners of Customs that in any Steam Ship measured before this Act comes into operation Store Rooms or Coal Bunkers have been introduced into or thrown across the Engine Room, so that the Deduction from the Tonnage on account of the Engine Room is larger than it ought to be, the said Commissioners may, if they think fit, direct such Engine Room to be remeasured according to the Rules in force before this Act comes into operation, excluding the Space occupied by such Store Rooms or Coal Bunkers, or may, if the Owners so desire, cause the Ship to be remeasured according to the Rules herein-before contained, and subject to the Conditions contained in the last preceding Section; and after Remeasurement the said Commissioners shall cause the Ship to be registered anew, or the Registry thereof to be altered, as the Case may require.

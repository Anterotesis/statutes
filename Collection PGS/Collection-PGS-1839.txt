being of the Tenure of ancient Demesne or otherwise, are

exempted from Payment of Tithes whilst in the Tenure, c Occupation, or Manurance of Her Majesty, Her Tenants,

Farmers, or Lessees, or their Undertenants, as the Case may c be, but become subject to Tithes when aliened or occupied 6 by Subjects not being Tenants, Farmers, or Lessees of the ' Crown, and Doubts have arisen how far the Provisions of the

said first-recited Act relating to Lands heretofore Parcel of

the Possessions of any privileged Order, or in the Nature of ' Glebe, or otherwise in like Manner privileged and phrtially c exempt, are applicable to such Crown Landsbe it declared and enacted, That all and every the said Provisions of the said first-recited Act do extend to such Crown Lands, and that the Provision lastly in this Act contained for substituting a fixed Rent-charge instead of a contingent Rent-charge on Lands partially exempt from Tithes shall extend and be applicable to such Crown Lands as aforesaid: Provided always, that no such fixed Rent-charge shall be substituted instead of such contingent Rent-charge on such Crown Lands without the Consent of the Persons or Officers who are by the said first-recited Act respectively required to be substituted in Cases of Commutation of

4 Portion of the Year only, and are liable to the Tithes of the " *

4 Produce of the said Lands increasing and growing thereon during such Occupation, and at other Portions of the Year are in the Occupation of other Persons, and in their Hands liable to different Kinds of Tithes arising from the Agistment, Produce, or Increase of Cattle or Stock thereon; and ' by reason of such Change of Occupation such last-mentioned Tithes cannot be commuted for a Rent-charge issuing out of or fixed upon the said Lands, and the said recited Acts are thereby rendered inoperative in the several Parishes where such Lammas Lands lie: And whereas the said Acts are in like

4 Manner inoperative in certain Cases where a personal Right

4 of Commonage, or a Right of Common in gross, is vested in certain Persons by reason of Inhabitancy or Occupation in the Parish where any Common may lie, or by Custom or Vicinage, but without having such Right of Common so annexed or appurtenant to or arising out or in respect of any Lands on which any Rent-charge could be fixed instead of the Tithes of the Cattle or Stock, or their Produce* Increase,

4 or Agistment, on such Common, annexed to such personal Right; ' for Remedy thereof be it enacted, That in every Case where by reason of the peculiar Tenure of such Lands, and the Change during the Year of the Occupiers thereof, or of such Right of Commonage, a Rent-charge cannot, in the Judgment of the said Commissioners, be fixed on the said Lands in respect of Cattle and Stock received and fed thereon, or of the Produce and Increase of such Cattle and Stock, at such Portion of the Year as the said Lands are thrown open, or where such Right of Commonage alone exists, it shall be lawful for the Parties interested in such Lands or Commons and the Tithes thereof in the Case of a Parochial Agreement, or for the Commissioners in the Case of a compulsory Award, in every such Parochial Agreement or Award respectively, or by any supplemental Agreement in the Nature of a Parochial Agreement, or by a supplemental Award, as the Case may be, where any Parochial Agreement or Award has been already made, to fix a Rent-charge instead of the Tithes of such Lammas Land or Commons, to be paid during the separate Occupation thereof by the separate Occupiers, in like Manner as other Rent-charges are fixed by the said Acts or any of them, and to declare in such Agreement or Award, or supplemental Agreement or Award, as the Case may be, such a Sum or Rate per Head to be jpaid for each Head of Cattle or Stock turned on to such Lammas Land or Commons by the Parties entitled to the Occupation thereof after the same shall have been so thrown open, or by the Parties entitled to such Right of Commonage as aforesaid; and every such Sum shall be ascertained and ifixed upon a Calculation of the Tithes received in respect of

such last-mentioned Occupation or Right for the Period and according to the Provisions for fixing Rent-charges in the said recited Acts, and shall be due and payable by the Owner of such Cattle or Stock on the same being first turned upon such Lands or Commons, and shall be recoverable by the Persons entitled thereto by Distress and impounding of the Cattle or Stock in respect of which such Sum shall be due, in like Manlier as Cattle are distrained and impounded for Rent, and be subject to the same Provisions as to Distress and Replevin of the same as are by Law provided in Cases of Distress for Rent: Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall extend to Lammas Lands where no Tithes or Payments instead of Tithes have been taken during the Seven Years ending at Christmas One thousand eight hundred and thirty-five in respect of the Cattle or Stock received and fed thereon, or of the Produce and Increase of such Cattle or Stock at such Portion of the Year as the said Lands are thrown open.

XIV. And whereas in certain Cases of Commons hereafter to be inclosed Allotments may be made in respect of Tenemerits and Hereditaments to which a Right of going on such Common is appendant or appurtenant, the Tithes whereof would be chargeable on the Tenements or Hereditaments in respect of which such Allotments may be made, and such Tenements or Hereditaments are not of themselves an adequate Security for the Rent-charge to be fixed in respect of such Tithes; * be it therefore declared and enacted. That in every such Case the Rent-charge to be fixed instead of such Tithes shall be a Charge upon and recoverable out of any Allotments to be in future made in respect of such Rights, as well as upon such Tenements or Hereditaments in respect of which such Allotments are made, and by the same Ways and Means as are provided for the Recovery of Rent-charges by the said Acts or any of them, or this Act.

XV. And be it declared and enacted, That all die Provisions in the recited Acts or any of them in any way relating to or enabling the pulling down or Sale of Barns and Buildings generally used for housing Tithes paid in Kind, and the Sale of the Materials and the Site thereof, either with or without any Farm Buildings or Homesteads thereto belonging, and for the Conveyance and Delivery thereof, and for securing the Consideration Money for the Benefit of the Persons thereunto entitled, shall apply to and may be made available by any Corporate Body or Person, whether as Trustees or otherwise, by any Master and Fellows of any College, Dean and Chapter of any Cathedral or Collegiate Church, Master or Guardian of any Hospital, Parson, Vicar, or any other having any Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Living, being seised or possessed of any such Barns or Buildings, or the Site thereof, notwithstanding any thing in a certain Statute made in the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, for making void fraudulent Deeds made by Spiritual Persons to defeat their Successors of Remedy for Dilapidations, or in any other Statute.

XIX. And be it enacted, That so much of the said first-recited Act as enables any Land Owner, either by Parochial Agreement or individually, to give Land instead of Tithes or Rent-charge at any Time before the Confirmation of any Instrument of Apportionment, shall be and the same is hereby extended, and the Powers and Provisions for that Purpose may be exercised in every such Case at any Time, as well after as before such Confirmation of the Apportionment as aforesaid, daring die Continuance of the Commission constituted and with thd; Consent of the Commissioners appointed and acting under the said first-recited Act.

4 Lives, or for Years, holding under a Lease or Agreement for a Lease on which a Rent of not less than Two Thirds of the clear yearly Value of the Premises therein shall have been reserved, and that without regard to the real Amount of Interest of such Person; and in every Case in which any

Tithes or Lands shall have been leased or agreed to be leased to any Person for Life or Lives or for Years by any Lease or Agreement for a Lease on which a Rent less than Two Thirds of the clear yearly Value of the Premises comprised therein shall have been reserved, the Person in receipt of such Rent shall, jointly with the Person liable to the Payment thereof, be deemed for the Purposes of the said Act to

4 be the Owner of such Tithes or Lands: And whereas certain 6&7W. 4. C. 71. 4 Allowances and Expences to Surveyors and Tithe Valuers s.74.

4 necessary for making any Award, and all other Expences of or incident to making an Award, are by the said recited Acts or some of them directed to be paid by the Land Owners and Tithe Owners interested in the said Award, in such Proportion, Time, and Manner as the Commissioners or Assistant Commissioners shall direct; and the Expences of or .75.

4 incident to making any Apportionment are by the said first *

4 recited Act to be paid by Owners of Lands in rateable Proportions to the Sums charged on the said Lands in lieu of Tithes by such Apportionment: And whereas Cases have occurred and may occur where by reason of the Rent reserved in certain Leases or Agreements for Leases not being less than Two Thirds of the clear yearly Value of the Premises thereby demised or agreed to be demised at the Date or Time of coming into operation of such Leases or Agreements,

4 but which Premises are at the Time of putting in force the Provisions of the said recited Acts of improved yearly Value,

4 so that the Rent originally reserved or agreed for is less than Two Thirds thereof, but by the Operation of the said recited Words, as defined in the said first-recited Act as aforesaid, such Expences, or a Part thereof, would, under die said Acts, be chargeable on the original Lessor or original Lessee, and not on the intermediate or Sub-Lessors or Lessees whose beneficial Interest in the said Lands and Tithes, or Rent-charge in lieu of Tithes, is proposed to be or has been dealt with under the said recited Acts, or some or One of them, or this Act: And whereas certain other Cases have occurred and may occur in which it is expedient that the Commissioners should be empowered to vary and fix the Proportion of the Expences of Apportionment, including therein the Expences of or incident to the Map or Plan annexed thereto, and the Copies thereof, between the Owners of the Lands affected thereby, as such Owners are defined in the said first-recited Act as aforesaid, and according to such

as they may deem it just and equitable, to order and direct that such Expences of or incident to any Award, or any Part thereof, shall be borne and paid in such Proportion and Manner, by and amongst the Persons interested in the Lands, Tithes, or Rent-charge respectively dealt with in such Award, and that such Expences of or incident to any Apportionment, or any Part thereof, shall be borne and paid by and amongst the Persons interested in the Lands, in such Proportions and Manner respectively as the said Commissioners shall direct; and such Expences, and every or any Part thereof, shall in every such Case be recoverable in like Manner as Expences, or the Share thereof to be borne by any Person, are or is recoverable under the Provisions of the said first-recited Act or this Act.

XXIV. And whereas in certain Cases of compulsory ' Award where Tithes are held by One Tithe Owner in different Rights, or where by reason of Owners of Land having c purchased or otherwise acquired such a beneficial Interest in ' the Tithes arising out of the same, for Life or Lives or for ' Years, as under the said Provisions of the said first-recited ' Act requires that such Persons respectively should be dealt

with and distinguished in such Award as joint Owners with ' the Lessor of or the Person having the reversionary Interest i in such Tithes, but great Difficulties have arisen in distin-c guishing the Sums payable to each such Tithe Owner, as i also in distinguishing the respective Lands out of which the 6 Tithes accruing to any such Tithe Owner, either as holding

such Tithes in different Rights or as joint Tithe Owmer, i arise, or whereon any several Rent-charge should be awarded, ' and the Completion of such Award has been thereby impeded; * be it therefore declared and enacted, That in any such Case it shall not be necessary in any such Award to distinguish the Lands or award a several Rent-charge to each such Owner of the Tithes by Name, or otherwise to distinguish such Tithe Owner, but it shall be sufficient to award a gross Rent-charge to such Owner of Tithes in different Rights in respect of such Tithes so held by him, or, as the Case may be, to the original Lessor of such Tithes, or the Person in whom the ultimate Reversion thereof shall be, by his proper Name and Description, and in any such Case of joint Ownership to the several Persons claiming under him, and being so respectively joint Owners of such Tithes, by such general Terms and Description as to the Commissioners or Assistant Commissioner making such Award shall seem fit: Provided always, that the Name of each such Tithe Owner, and the Lands out of which his respective Tithes, or the Portion of such gross Rent-charge instead of such Tithes, shall respectively accrue or issue, shall be distinguished in the Instrument of Apportionment made in pursuance of such Award; and every such Tithe Owner shall be as fully entitled to take, hold, and recover such Portion of the Rent-charge as shall be so apportioned in such Instrument of Apportionment, upon the several Lands the Tithes or

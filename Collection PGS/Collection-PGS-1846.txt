Fifth. — If a Combination of the Circumstances and Advantages described in the foregoing Regulations should be found to exist, or in Cases where Piers or Harbours chiefly useful for the Refuge and Rendezvous of Fishing Vessels are constructed near remote Headlands or in Islands, the Amount of such Loan ought to be secured by and become chargeable on the County or Counties," " District," or " Lands," in proportionate Parts accordingly.

XIII. And be it enacted, That the said Commissioners shall cause a Copy of such provisional Declaration, together with such Maps, Plans, Sections, and Estimates of the proposed Works as they shall think fit and sufficient, to be deposited for public Inspection at all reasonable Times, for a Period not less than Two Weeks, in such convenient Place or Places as the said Commissioners shall think proper within the County or Counties, or in or in the Vicinity of the District or Lands, as the Case may be, which it is proposed should become chargeable with the Repayment of any Money advanced by way of Loan for such Works; and all Persons shall be at liberty to inspect or make Copies of or Extracts from such Declaration, Maps, Plans, Sections, or Estimates which may be so deposited; and Notice of the Time and Place of such Deposit shall be published in some Newspaper usually circulated in the County, District, or Place in or near which said Work is proposed to be made or constructed, and posted in such public Places as the said Commissioners shall think fit within such County, or in or near such District or Place as aforesaid; and by such Notice all Parties interested shall be required, on or before a Day therein to be named, not Sooner than Two Weeks from such Publication and posting as aforesaid of such Notice, to transmit to the Secretary of the said Commissioners in Dublin their Objections (if any) in Writing to the said Declaration, Maps, Plans, Sections, and Estimates, and all other Objections which such Parties shall think fit to make with respect to any thing proposed to be done by the said Commissioners under the Provisions of this Act.

VIII. And whereas under the Provisions of the said first recited Act much Expence

and Delay are caused in the Proceedings preliminary to the issuing of the final Notice to be published by the said Commissioners, and to the Commencement of the Works by said Act authorized, and many of such Proceedings may, under the Provisions herein contained,

be dispensed with or postponed; be it therefore enacted, That for the Purpose of all such preliminary Proceedings, and to authorize the said Commissioners to hold the Meeting by the said first-recited Act directed previously to taking the Assents of Proprietors to the

Execution

9° VICTORIA, c. 4.

Execution of any Work under said Acts or this Act, and making the Declaration aforesaid by said Acts or this Act directed to be made, as also issuing the final Notice by the said first-recited Act directed to be given previously to proceeding with the Execution of any of the Works by said Acts or this Act authorized, it shall not be necessary for the said Commissioners to obtain in detail a Survey or Valuation of the several Plots or Portions of Land proposed to be drained or improved, or to make more than One Survey of any such Land, or to inquire into Particulars of Titles or Tenures of the respective Proprietors, Lessees, or Occupiers of such Lands, or to state in detail the Proportions in which such Lands shall be liable to the Costs of the Execution of the proposed Works, or the Lands or other Property to be purchased for the Execution of the Works, or the Owners, Lessees, or Occupiers of such Land, but, as regards all such Matters and Things as aforesaid, and for the Purpose of enabling the said Commissioners to take the Assents of Proprietors, and to make the Declaration in and by the said recited Acts or this Act authorized, and to issue such final Notice as aforesaid, it shall be deemed sufficient to have prepared and deposited such Plans, Sections, and Estimates as the said Commissioners may consider sufficient for the Purpose of showing the Works to be executed, with the estimated Costs thereof, including all Expences incidental thereto, showing also the District or Limits within which it is proposed to put the Powers of the said Acts or this Act into execution, as well as the Extent of Land or River to be drained or improved, together with a general Statement of the average present Value of the Lands to be drained or improved, and of the Increase in such average Value estimated to arise from the Execution of the proposed Works, and a List of the reputed Proprietors of such Lands, with a Return of the Quantity of Land within such District held by such Proprietors respectively, so far as the same may have been ascertained by such general Survey as aforesaid, any thing in the said recited Acts or either of them, requiring any further or other Schedules, Maps, Plans, Matters, or Things whatsoever, to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.

IX. And be it enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Grand Jury, at the Assizes of any County within which any River or Stream capable of being deepened, widened, altered, or improved, for the Purpose of Drainage of any Lands which may be situate along or near such River, to make, if they shall so think fit, a Presentment, directing their Secretary to apply by Memorial to the said Commissioners for the Drainage or Improvement of any Lands along or near such River or Stream, and which may be flooded or injured by Water, or are capable of being drained, or the Drainage whereof may be capable of being improved, and to present (without Application to Presentment Sessions) any Sums which may be required for or towards defraying the Expences of the preliminary Inquiries for the Purpose of any such Drainage; and all and every the Powers, Authorities, and Provisions in and by the said first-recited Act given and contained for or in respect of the Memorial of any Grand Jury to the said Commissioners, and the Notice in respect thereof for the making or improving any Navigation under the Provisions of the said first-recited Act, as well as the Recovery and Payment of all Expences incurred in consequence of such Memorial, shall be deemed to apply to any such Memorial under this Act, and the Proceedings relating thereto for the Drainage of Lands as aforesaid, and the Recovery and Payment of all Expences incurred in consequence of such last-mentioned Memorial: Provided always, that in all Cases where under any such Memorial as aforesaid the necessary Works shall be undertaken and carried out by the said Commissioners, the Amount which shall have been so presented and paid to the said Commissioners shall, out of the first Monies borrowed for the Execution of such Works, be repaid to the Treasurer of such County, and be by him brought to the Credit of the County at large, or the Barony, Half Barony, or Townland, on or from which the same shall have been levied.

X. And whereas it has been found in many Cases that by reason of the Insufficiency of the Sums deposited or required to be deposited for defraying the Expence of preliminary ' Proceedings, and from the Difficulty experienced in procuring additional Funds until such ' preliminary Proceedings have been completed, great Delay has been caused, and the Commencement of many useful Works retarded; be it therefore enacted, That, with a view to expedite the Proceedings preliminary to the Execution of any of the Works under the said recited Acts or this Act, it shall and may be lawful for the Commissioners of Her Majesty's

the Proprietors of Two Thirds or more in Extent of the Land proposed to be drained or c improved by such Drainage shall assent to the Execution thereof, in Writing under their c Hands respectively, within such Time as the said Commissioners shall appoint: And whereas, by reason of the Absence of many Proprietors, as well as the Omission of others

to sign the necessary Assent, even in Cases where they have not expressed Dissent, and from other Causes, it has been found difficult to obtain the written Assents of so many c Proprietors as heretofore required, and thereby the Execution of many important and useful ' Works of Improvement have been and are injuriously delayed; be it therefore enacted, That all or any of the Works for the Drainage of Land under and by virtue of the said recited Acts or this Act, whether in connexion with Works for the Improvement of Water Powrer, Navigation, or otherwise, may be commenced, in case the Proprietors of any Quantity exceeding One Half in Extent of the Lands proposed to be drained or improved by such Drainage shall, writh the Consent of the Tenants (if any) of such Lands, as in and by said first-recited Act required, assent, or shall have heretofore assented, to the Execution of the proposed Works, in Writing under their Hands respectively, writhin such Time as the said Commissioners shall appoint, any thing in the said recited Act to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.

XXIII. And whereas in and by the said first-recited Act the said Commissioners are authorized and empowered to make Reservoirs and Embankments for the Purpose of maintaining 1 a constant Supply of Water for Mills or Factories on any River or Stream, or preventing ' sudden Floods therein, but for Want of sufficient Powers as to the Purchase of Lands and ' Hereditaments necessary for such Purpose it has been found impracticable to carry into ' execution such Works, and it is expedient to supply such Powers be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the said Commissioners to purchase and take any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments which they may consider necessary or proper to purchase for the Purpose of making such Reservoir or Embankment, and that all and every the Provisions, Powers, and Authorities in and by the said recited Acts or either of them, or this Act, contained or given for the Purpose of or relating to entering upon, occupying, using, or purchasing any Lands required for the Works for Drainage or Navigation, or for compensating any Parties or Person for any Injury done to any Lands in and by the said recited Acts or this Act authorized, or relating to the Purchase Money of Lands, or to any Matter or Thing concerning such Lands shall extend and apply, and shall and may be used, exercised, and applied by the said Commissioners, with respect to any Lands which they may deem necessary to enter upon, use, occupy, or purchase for the Purpose of making any such Reservoir or Embankment as herein-before mentioned, or which may be injured by means of the Construction of any such Work, or by reason of the Exercise of the Powers aforesaid, any thing in the said first-recited Act to the contrary notwithstanding.

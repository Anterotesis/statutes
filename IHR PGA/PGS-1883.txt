Power to bor- 0. Whereas by a Bill pending in Parliament, for an Act to be rur oses1 of called the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, it

Tmnways and is (among other things) provided that the twentieth section of the Public Com- Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act, 1882, enabling grants to be made wnS a*r~ in aid of emigration, shall be amended as therein mentioned/and

1883. I that the sum of two hundred thousand pounds shall be substituted

45 & 46 Vict. in that section for the sum of one hundred thousand pounds therein c-47- mentioned, and thereby the raising of an additional sum of one

hundred thousand pounds by the Irish Land Commission for the purposes of the said section as so amended is rendered necessary: c562 46 VICT And whereas by section six of the Public Works Loans Act, 1882, the Irish Land Commission, for the purpose of paying money for grants under the said section of the Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act, 1882, and for other purposes under that Act, were authorised to borrow on the security of the Irish Church Temporalities Fund, such sums not exceeding in the whole two million six hundred thousand pounds, at the rate and on the terms and in the manner and with the guarantee of the Consolidated Fund as therein mentioned:

And whereas it is expedient to extend the said section of the Public Works Loans Act, 1882, to the raising of the said additional sum of one hundred thousand pounds:$

Be it therefore enacted as follows : — -

In the event of the above recited provision of the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, being passed into law, the Irish Land Commission may borrow the said additional sum of one hundred thousand pounds in manner provided by section six of the Public Works Loans Act, 1882, and that section shall apply in like manner as if two million seven hundred thousand pounds were therein substituted for two million six hundred thousand pounds.

PART IV.

Provision as to certain Loams.

^one'debts due Whereas the Public Works Loan Commissioners, in the year fromtnistees'of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, and subsequent years, Arbroath bar- advanced to the Aberbrothwich otherwise called Arbroath Harbour Trustees sums amounting in the whole to twenty thousand pounds, which sums were expended on works for the harbour of Arbroath, and, with interest at the rate of three and a half per cent, per annum, are repayable out of the revenues of the harbour by annuities terminating between the years one thousand nine hundred and twenty-two and one thousand nine hundred and twenty-five; and by the payment of such annuities the capital now due has been reduced to eighteen thousand six hundred and sixty-four pounds five shillings and tenpence:

And whereas the revenues of the harbour are applicable in the first place for the management and maintenance thereof:

And whereas an accident has occurred whereby serious injury has been caused to the works of the harbour, and the estimated cost of the works necessary for the repair of such injury amounts to ten thousand pounds:

201

]883. Public Works Loam Act, 1833. Ch. 42.

And whereas, with a view to the repair of the said injury to the works of the harbour, it is expedient to authorise such suspension of the payment of the said annuities due to the Public Works Loan Commissioners as is herein-after mentioned: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The Public Works Loan Commissioners, subject to such conditions as may seem expedient, may, with the consent of the Treasury, suspend the payments on account of the advances made by the Public Works Loan Commissioners to the Arbroath Harbour Trustees and the interest thereon during such period not exceeding' five years from the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and 'eighty-two, as may be considered necessary for the purpose of enabling the Arbroath Harbour Trustees to repair the said injury to the works of the harbour, and the Public Works Loan Commissioners may, if they think fit, with the consent of the Treasury, enter into arrangements with the Arbroath Harbour Trustees for payment of the said capital debt of eighteen thousand six hundred and sixty-four pounds five shillings and tenpence, with all interest due and to become due thereon, by instalments commencing after the said period of suspension, and terminating in or before the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty, and any such arrangement may include the capitalization of such interest.

8. Whereas divers sums amounting in the whole to fifteen Provision as to thousand eight hundred and fifty pounds were advanced in the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-six and subsequent years, rJ^ge' out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, in aid of the building of a bridge at Limerick, called the Athlunkard Bridge, and the said sums were advanced to the bridge commissioners on the security of the tolls of the bridge, and were repayable by annual instalments with interest at the rate of four per cent, per annum:

And whereas no instalment of principal has ever been paid, and there was due on the thirty-first day of December one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two in respect of arrears of interest on the said-advances the sum of eighteen thousand three hundred and thirty-seven pounds nineteen shillings and elevenpence, and the total sum now due to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland for principal and interest amounts to “thirty-four thousand one hundred and eighty-seven pounds nineteen shillings and elevenpence:

And whereas the bridge commissioners held the bridge on trust for the public, and derived no pecuniary benefit therefrom, and they or the larger part of them are dead, and there is no power to appoint any new commissioners:

And whereas in consequence of the deaths of some of the bridge commissioners, and the absence of any power to appoint new commissioners, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland took possession in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight of the bridge and the tolls thereof, and have ever since been in possession of the tolls, and maintained the bridge, and applied the surplus of the tolls, after payment of the expenses of collection and the maintenance of the bridge, in payment of the interest on the said advances:

202

Ch'. 42. Public Works Loam Act, 1883. 46 & 47 Vict.

And whereas the average annual amount applicable to the payment of such interest during the six years ending on the thirty-first of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three amounted to four hundred and fifty-eight pounds six shillings and eightpence, and with the exception of such surplus tolls, no other moneys are applicable to the repayment of the said advances and the interest thereon:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the composition of the said debt and the abolition of the tolls on the bridge and for the maintenance of the bridge in manner herein-after provided: Be it therefore enacted as follows: —

(1.) If the Treasury are satisfied that payment to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland of the sum of six thousand pounds by fifty equal half-yearly instalments together with interest at the rate of three and a quarter per cent, per annum is secured in manner provided by this section, and that the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of the city of Limerick (in this section referred to as the corporation of Limerick) have undertaken as herein-after mentioned to maintain the Athlunkard Bridge and the approaches thereto, they may authorise the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland to make, and such Commissioners may accordingly make an order under this section, and by such order may remit the said advance of fifteen thousand eight hundred and fifty pounds, and all arrears of interest due thereon, and the excess of the sum so remitted over and above the said sum of six thousand pounds shall be deemed to be a free grant by Parliament; and further, the said order may declare that Athlunkard Bridge shall, as from the date specified in the order, be free from toll, and be vested in the Corporation of Limerick for the use of the public, and thereupon, as from the date specified in the order, the said bridge shall be free from toll, and it shall be the duty of the Corporation of Limerick to maintain the bridge and the roadway thereof and the approaches thereto in good repair and condition.

(2.) The grand jury of the county of Clare, if a presentment has been duly made by presentment sessions, and the grand jury think fit, may present that the county of Clare shall be charged with the payment to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland of a portion of the said sum of six thousand pounds with interest thereon.

(3.) The Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland shall ascertain what sum would be charged in respect of each hundred pounds of the said sum of six thousand pounds, and so in proportion for smaller parts thereof, if the same were to be discharged by fifty equal half-yearly instalments, beginning at the time mentioned in the certificate, with interest on the unpaid portion at the rate of three and a quarter per cent, per annum, and shall certify the sum so ascertained to the presentment sessions for the said county before the meeting thereof for the purposes of this section, and shall also certify the same to the grand jury before the assizes at which the presentment of the grand jury is proposed to be made.

(4.) The presentment of the grand jury, if made, shall provide for the payment of any sum which is presented by fifty equal half-yearly instalments, which shall be applotted and levied from time to time without any further presentment, and shall commence at the time mentioned in the certificate.

(5.) Any presentment under this section may be traversed and may be fiated by the judge of assize in like manner as any other presentments of a grand jury.

(6.) For the purposes of this section a special meeting of the county at large presentment sessions of Clare may be held on a day to be appointed by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland within twelve months after the passing of this Act.

(7.) The justices and associated cesspayers for the time being entitled to attend at the ordinary county at large presentment sessions of the said county shall be entitled to attend at a meeting of the presentment sessions under this section.

A like notice shall be given of the intention to submit a presentment for the purposes of this section at any ordinary meeting of county at large presentment sessions. The Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland may make such arrangements as they think fit respecting the making of an application for any presentment under this section.

(10.) Some person nominated for that purpose by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland shall attend at any such meeting, and shall give information to the meeting as to the powers conferred upon the presentment sessions and grand jury by this section; and as to the amount for which the county may become liable if the meeting agrees that any charge should be imposed.

(11.) The Corporation of Limerick may, by a resolution of the council undertake to hold for the use of the public the Athlunkard Bridge and the approaches thereto, and to maintain the same in good and sufficient- order, repair, and condition, and to light the bridge and approaches in a sufficient manner.

(12.) The Corporation of Limerick may, by a resolution of the council passed within six months after the making of any grand jury presentment under this section, undertake to pay to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland such poi'tion

(a.) if the candidate applies to the High Court or an election ^®gcl^on court and shows that the failure to transmit such return and election 8 declarations, or any of them, or any part thereof, or any error expenses, or false statement therein, has arisen by reason of his illness, or of the absence, death, illness, or misconduct of his election agent or sub-agent or of any clerk or officer of such agent, or by reason of inadvertence or of any reasonable cause of a like nature, and not by reason of any want of good faith on the part of the applicant, or (b.) if the election agent of the candidate applies to the High Court or an election court and shows that the failure to transmit the return and declarations which he was required to transmit, or any part thereof, or any error or false statement therein, arose by reason of his illness or of the death or illness of any prior election agent of the candidate, or of the absence, death, illness, or misconduct of any sub-agent, clerk, or officer of an election agent of the candidate, or by reason of inadvertence or of any reasonable cause of a like nature, and not by reason of any want of good faith on the part of the applicant, the court may, after such notice of the application in the said county or borough, and on production of such evidence of the grounds stated in the application, and of the good faith of the application, and otherwise, as to the court seems fit, make such order for allowing an authorised excuse for the failure to transmit such return and declaration, or for an error or false statement in such return and declaration, as to the court seems just.

' The interest Charged was five per cent, in consequence of the interest to he charged hy the Commissioners having been raised from four' to five per cent, .by 7 Geo. 4. c.'39. s. 2, hut in consequence of 5 Geo. 4. c: 88. not having been recited in the later I 'Act1 raising the interest it was considered that the Commissioners had no power to ihkge more than four per cent. It 'appears to have heen considered that this I prevented the Commissioners from recovering the principal, and no principal or1 interest Has ever heen paid.

Phe loan was' advanced in 1889 towards rebuilding the church. The instalments : of principal were repaid for three years, after which the same objection was taken as in the case of Minwere.

rhe loan was advanced in 1831 in aid of the repairs of the church. The instalments of principal were repaid for 18 years, but in 1847 the same objection was taken as in the case of Minwere.

Ohe loan was advanced in 1843 for enlarging the church. A similar objection was taken to that in Minwere and only two instalments have been repaid.

on dues leviable under the authority of a royal charter of 1617 by the magistrates and council of the town. The instalments of principal were repaid for five years, after which the power of levying the dues was contested and decided in the sheriff court against the magistrates and council. The balance has remained outstanding ever since, and nO interest has been paid upon it.

The loan was advanced between 1848 — 45 towards the construction of a pier at Southend. The Commissioners took possession of the pier and sold it in 1851, thereby recovering 14;000/. The balance had been privately guaranteed, and a sum of 1,600/. was accepted as a composition for the amount due from the sureties.

The loan was advanced in 1818 to W- Pittoclc of Deal to assist him in catching and curing herrings. After repayment of some instalments he became bankrupt, and a portion only of the balance was recovered.

The sum was advanced in 1827 for the construction of a railway which was in-. tended to serve for the conveyance of a certain kind of freestone. The Commissioners took possession, and sold the rails, &c. The proceeds of the sale are the only amount recovered. No interest has ever been paid.

In 1875, 7021. having been | paid in respect of principal and a very inadequate sum by way of interest, the I Commissioners took possession, and put up the undertaking to auction. There | were no bidders, and they held the railway for a year, when it was sold for 40,0002., pursuant to the Act 39 & 40 Vict. c. xcviii. (Local), the net sum received being I 84,626/. 13s. 3d.

The loan was advanced in 1827 (on security of the tolls) for making a road from Cork to Ballyhooly, whence it was to be continued towards Dublin. One instalment of principal was repaid, and a sum of 480/. for interest. No other sum has been received. The road is now maintained by the county, and no tolls are levied. The loan was collaterally secured by personal bonds from different landowners, but in 1842 the Government acquiesced in the Loan Commissioners not attempting to enforce those bonds, and lapse of time would appear to make it impossible now to do so.

Account of Advance and Reason for Remission. 6.

The sum of 662/. Is. 8d. was allocated to Mr. Scott for Cahercon. His estate was sold, but the charge of the loan on his estate was informal, and the sum became therefore irrecoverable.

Lord Monteagle promised to contribute to Foynes Harbour a sum of 4,250/. 2s. 6c?., for which he transferred 4,500/. consols to the Commissioners. These consols were sold when the market was low, and consequently the amount realised by the sale was insufficient to pay the whole of the sum, and Lord Monteagle declined to pay the deficiency (153/. 7s. Id.') on the ground that the consols were sold without his concurrence.

The sum of 11,821/. 4s. Id. was allocated for works on the Lower Shannon, which were not executed in consequence of the failure of localities and individuals to guarantee this portion of the cost, and the sum was appropriated, by permission of the Treasury, towards urgent works on the Upper Shannon, but could not be recovered from the counties in consequence of there being no power to increase the assessment upon the counties.

The larger part of the loan was advanced for reclaiming the slob lands (an area of about 300 acres), a work undertaken during the Irish famine. Difficulties arose in disposing of the land reclaimed, and in 1866 the Commissioners spent 660/. in fencing and improving the sluices. The property has been offered for sale to the adjacent proprietors and t.o the neighbouring tenantry, but no offer was obtained. The property has now been sold for 2,000/. There is no security for the rest of the loan.

FIRST SCHEDULE.

Mode of testing Petroleum so as to ascertain the Temperature at

WHICH IT WILL GIVE OFF INFLAMMABLE VAPOUR.

Specification op the Test Apparatus.

The following is a description of the details of the apparatus :

The oil cup consists of a cylindrical vessel 2" diameter, 2^" height (internal), with | outward projecting rim wide, f" from the top, and 1|-" from the bottom of the cup,

It is made of gun metal or brass (17 B.W.G.) tinned inside. A bracket, consisting of > short stout piece of wire bent upwards and terminating in a point, is fixed to the inside of i the cup to serve as a gauge. The distance of the point from the bottom of the cup is I51, The cup is provided with a close-fitting overlapping cover made of brass (22 B.W.G.), ' which carries the thermometer and test lamp. The latter is suspended from two support from the side by means of trunnions upon which it may be made to oscillate, it is profile! with a spout, the mouth of which is one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter. The socket which is to hold the thermometer is fixed at such an angle and its length is so adjusted | that the bulb of the thermometer when inserted to its full depth shall be 1^" below the centre of the lid.

The cover is provided with three square holes, one in the centre, -fa" by and two smaller ones, b7 A" close to the sides and opposite' each other. These three holes may be closed and uncovered by means of a slide moving in grooves, and having perforations corresponding to those on the lid.

In moving the slide so as to uncover the -holes, the oscillating lamp is caught by a pin fixed in the slide, and tilted in such a way as to bring the end of the spout just helow the surface of the lid. Upon the slide being pushed back so as to cover the holes, the lafflp returns to its original position.

Upon the cover, in front of and in line with the mouth of the lamp, is fixed a v# bead, the dimensions of which represent the size of the test flame to be used.

The bath or heated vessel consists of two flat-bottomed copper cylinders (24 B.W.G.)i an inner one of 3" diameter and 2|" height, and an outer one of diameter and 5| height; they are soldered to a circular copper plate (20 B.W.G.) perforated in the centre, which forms the top of the bath, in such a manner as to enclose the space between tk® two cylinders, but leaving access to the inner cylinder. The top of the bath project8 both outwards and inwards about §-"; that is, its diameter is about -f" greater than tb^ of the body of the bath, while the diameter of the circular opening in the centre is aboid the same amount less than that of the inner copper cylinder. To the inner projection0; the top is fastened, by six small screws, a flat ring of ebonite, the screws being si®” below the surface of the ebonite, to avoid metallic contact between the bath and the0'

Petroleum Act, 1879. Ch. 47. 233

cnp. The exact distance between the sides and bottom of the bath and of the oil lamp jjone-balf of an inch. A split socket similar to that on the cover of the oil cup, but ggt at a right angle, allows a thermometer to be inserted into the space between the two cylinders. The bath is further provided with a funnel, an overflow pipe, and two loop handles.

The bath rests upon a cast-iron tripod stand, to the ring of which is attached a copper cylinder or jacket (24 B.W.G.) flanged at the top, and of such dimensions that the bath, while firmly resting on the iron ring, just touches with its projecting top the in ward-turned flange. The diameter of this outer jacket is 6^". One of the three legs of the stand serves as support for the spirit lamp attached to it by means of a small swing bracket. The distance of the wick holder from the bottom of the bath is 1".

Two thermometers are provided with the apparatus, the one for ascertaining the temperature of the bath, the other for determining the flashing point. The thermometer for ascertaining the temperature of the water has a long bulb and a space at the top. Its range is from about 90° to 190° Fahrenheit. The scale (in degrees of Fahrenheit) is marked on an ivory back fastened to the tube in the usual way. It is fitted with a metal collar, fitting the socket, and the part of the tube helow the scale should have a length of about 3^" measured from the lower end of the scale to the end of the bulb. The thermo-meterfor ascertaining the temperature of the oil is fitted with collar and ivory scale in a similar manner to the one described. It has a round bulb, a space at the top, and ranges from about 55° F. to 150° F.; it measures from end of ivory back to bulb 2£".

Note. — A model apparatus is deposited at the Weights and Measures Department of | the Board of Trade.

Directions for applying the Flashing Test.

1. The test apparatus is to be placed for use in a position .where it is not exposed to currents of air or draughts.

2. The heating vessel or water bath is filled by pouring water into the funnel until it begins to flow out at the spout of the vessel. The temperature of the water at the commencement of the test is to be 130° Fahrenheit, and this is attained in the first instance either by mixing hot and cold water in the bath, or in a vessel from which the bath is filled, until the thermometer which is provided for testing the temperature of the water gives the- proper indication; or by heating the water with the spirit lamp (which is attached to the stand of the apparatus) until the required temperature is indicated.

If the water has been heated too highly, it is easily reduced to 130° by pouring in cold water little by little (to replace a portion of the warm water) until the thermometer gives the proper reading.

When a test has been completed, this water bath is again raised to 1306 by placing the lamp underneath, and the result is readily obtained while the petroleum cup is being emptied, cooled, and refilled-with a fresh sample to be tested. The lamp is then turned ouits swivel from under the apparatus, and the next test is proceeded with.

3. The test lamp is prepared for use by fitting it with a piece of flat plaited candlewick, and filling it with colza or rape oil up to the lower edge of the opening of the spout or wick tube. The lamp is trimmed so that when lighted it gives a flame of about 0-15 of an inch diameter, and this size of flame which is represented by the projecting white bead an the cover of the oil cup is readily maintained by simple manipulation from time to lime with a small wire trimmer.

When gas is available it may be conveniently used in place of the little oil lamp, and for this purpose a test-flame arrangement for use with gas may be substituted for the lamp.

4. The bath having been raised to the proper temperature, the oil to be tested is intro-Inced into the petroleum cup, being poured in slowly until the level of the liquid just 'caches the point of the gauge which is fixed in the cup. In warm weather the temperature of the room in which the samples to be tested have been kept should he observed in the Hmt instance, and if it exceeds 65° the samples to be tested should he cooled down (to about 60°) by immersing the bottles containing them in cold water, or by any other con-'cnient method. The lid of the cup, with the slide closed, is then put on, and the cup is placed into the bath or heating vessel. The thermometer in the lid of the cup has been pasted so as to have its bulb just immersed in the liquid, and its position is not under

turn

1

234 Ch. 47, 48. Petroleum Act, 1879. 42&43y

any circumstances to be altered. When the cup has been placed in the proper the scale of the thermometer faces the operator. J

5. The test lamp is then placed in position upon the lid of the cup, the lead v pendulum, which has been fixed in a convenient position in front of the operator, j,\ motion, and the rise of the thermometer in the petroleum cup is watched. 'WuS temperature has reached about 66° the operation of testing is to be commenced, tk1 ^ flame being applied once for every rise of one degree, in the following manner^ The slide is slowly drawn open while the pendulum performs three oscillations . closed during the fourth oscillation.

Note). — If it is desired to employ the test apparatus to determine the flashing jp,j, oils of very low volatility, the mode of proceeding is to be modified as follows The air-chamber which surrounds the cup is filled with cold water, to a depth of i inches, and the heating vessel or water bath is filled as usual, but also with cold mJ The lamp is then placed under the apparatus and kept there during the entire operafi If a very heavy oil is being dealt with, the operation may be commenced with Z) previously heated to 120°, instead of with cold water.

Where a person is adjudged by the conviction of a court of summary jurisdiction, or in the case of a sum not a civil debt by an order of such court, to pay any sum of money, and on default of payment of such sum a warrant of distress is authorised to be issued, and it appears to the court of summary jurisdiction to whom application is made to issue such warrant that such person has no goods whereon to levy the distress, or that in the event of a warrant of distress being issued his goods will be insufficient to satisfy the money payable by him, or that the levy of the distress will be more injurious to him or his family than imprisonment, such court, instead of issuing such warrant of distress, may, if it think fit, order the said person on nonpayment of the said sum to be imprisoned for any period not exceeding the period for which he is liable under such conviction or order to be imprisoned in default of sufficient distress.

3. The advances made by the Public Works Loan Commis- Restriction on sioners, or by. the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, under amoun*of |gg any one Act, in any one financial year to one borrower (notwith- rover. 1 standing anything in the Act authorising such loan) shall not Exceed in the aggregate one hundred thousand pounds.

Loan Commissioners advanced to the Harbour Commissioners of 24 & 25 Vict. the Isle of Mon, for the purpose of works at Port Erin in the Isle °'6^271|||[ of Man, sums amounting in the aggregate to fifty-eight thousand c. 86. two hundred pounds on the security of the dues leviable at Port 27 & 38 Vict. Erin under the Isle of Man Harbours Act, 1863, and on the collateral ^6&27 y;ct_ security of a sum not exceeding one thousand six hundred pounds e. 86. in any one year payable out of any surplus of the customs revenues of the Isle of Man :

And whereas by the Isle of Man Customs, Harbours, and Public 29 & so Vict Purposes Act, 1866, the said annual sum of one thousand six hundred p- 23. pounds was made payable out of the sum of ten thousand pounds payable as therein mentioned out of the customs of the Isle of Man into Her Majesty's Exohequer:

85 & 86 Tiot. And whereas by the Isle of Man Harbours Act, 1872, the above-

tions for their honest and good behaviour as the said court should think fit and reasonable, and should upon such their admission pay to the chamberlain of the said city for the time being, for the uses therein-after mentioned, the sum of forty shillings, and should also yearly pay to the said uses the sum of forty shillings upon the twenty-ninth day of September in every year; and it was further enacted, that if any person or persons, from and after the determination of the then session of Parliament, should take upon him to act as a broker or employ any other under him to act as such within the said city and liberties, not being admitted as aforesaid, every such person so offending should forfeit and pay to the use of the said mayor and commonalty and citizens of the said city for every such offence the sum of twenty-five pounds, to be recovered as in the said Act is mentioned:

And whereas by an Act (local and personal) made and passed in the fifty-seventh year of the reign of King George the Third, intituled " An Act for granting an equivalent for the diminution of " the profits of the office of gauger of the city of London, and " increasing the payments to be made by brokers," after reciting, amongst other things, the before-mentioned Act, it was, amongst other things, enacted that all persons that from and after the first day of July next after the passing of that Act should be admitted to act as brokers within the city of London and liberties thereof by the said court, in pursuance of the said recited Act of Parliament, should upon such their admission, over and above the sum of forty shillings required to be paid by the said recited Act, pay to the chamberlain of the- said city for the time being the sum of. three pounds, and should also yearly pay to the said chamberlain, over and above the said yearly sum of forty shillings required to be paid by the said recited Act, the sum of three pounds-on the twenty-ninth day of September in every year; and it was, amongst other things, further enacted, that so much of the said recited Act as imposed a penalty of twenty-five pounds upon any person who should take upon him to act as a broker, or employ any person under him to act as such, not being admitted in pursuance of the said recited Act, should be and the same was thereby repealed; and that, from and after the passing of the now reciting Act, if any person should take upon him to act as a broker or employ or cause, permit, or suffer any person or persons to be employed with, under, or for him to act as such within the said city and liberties, not being admitted in pursuance of the said recited Act, every such person so offending should forfeit and pay to the use of the mayor and commonalty and citizens of the said city for every such offence the sum of one hundred pounds, to be recovered as in the now reciting Act is mentioned:

admitted into the office and employment of a broker within the said city and liberties thereof were to carry on their business as brokers, and exercised and claimed a right to exercise jurisdiction and control over such brokers for the purpose of enforcing the observance of the said regulations, restrictions, and limitations:

party, certify (as he was thereby empowered to do) that such broker had been guilty of fraud, and that he ought to be disqualified from acting as a broker altogether, or for such period as such judge should name in the certificate, such broker should accordingly be disqualified as from the date of such conviction or certificate, and his name should thereupon be removed by the court of aldermen from the list of brokers either absolutely or for the time mentioned in such certificate:

And whereas it is expedient that brokers should be relieved from the necessity of being admitted by the court, and from the payment to the chamberlain of the said city of the said sums of forty shillings and three pounds on admission, and that the yearly sums of forty shillings and three pounds payable by or under the said recited Acts should cease to be payable after the twenty-ninth day of September one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, and that the court should from that date be relieved from the duty of keeping a list containing the names and addresses of brokers as herein-after provided:

And whereas it is desirable that the trustees and patrons of such churches and chapels as aforesaid should be authorised to adopt and apply to such churches and chapels respectively, and the patronage and property thereof, such of the aforesaid provisions and regulations as may in their opinion be best adapted to carry out the original intention of the trusts of such churches or chapels, having regard to the altered circumstances of the said Irish Church, notwithstanding that other provisions may have been made for the like purposes in the said Church Building Acts, or some of them, or in the instruments governing the trusts relating to such churches or chapels respectively; but doubts have arisen whether such provisions and regulations, or any of them, can be made to apply to such churches and chapels, or any of them, or the patronage or property thereof, or to any of the districts which were at the time of the passing of the said Irish Church Act, 1869, thereto respectively assigned or annexed, or therewith respectively connected, and it is expedient to remove such doubts:

An Act to amend the Law respecting the Payment of Naval and Greenwich Hospital Pensions. [7th August 1884.]

WHEREAS in pursuance of the Act of the session of the nineteenth and twentieth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter fifteen, intituled " An Act for further regulating " the Payment of the Out-Pensioners of Greenwich and Chelsea <! Hospitals," one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State makes regulations for the management and payment of the Greenwich out-pensioners and pays the pensions of those pensioners, but in other respects those pensioners are subject to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty (in this Act referred to as the Admiralty):

And whereas the Greenwich Hospital Act, 1865, provided that 28 & 29 Vict. the said pensions should be called naval pensions : c. 89.

And whereas the Naval and Marine Pay and Pensions Act, 1860, 28 & 29 Vict. made provisions with respect to the pensions of seamen and marines c-subject to the enactment in section ten thereof that nothing in that Act should take away or abridge any power vested in one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State relative to naval pensions:

10.0

28 &29 Vict. And whereas by the Admiralty (Powers, &c.) Act, 1865, provision I °* 134‘ is made for punishing persons who obtain pensions or money from the Admiralty by personation or other fraudulent means:

And whereas it is expedient that the payment of the said naval I pensions should be wholly under the control of the Admiralty:

And whereas by the Greenwich Hospital Acts, 1865 to 1888, I provision was made respecting pensions and gratuities to persons entitled to the benefits of Greenwich Hospital and to their widows, and for distinguishing the same as Greenwich Hospital pensions, I gratuities, and allowances:

And whereas doubts may arise as to the application of the Naval I and Marine Pay and Pensions Act, 1865, and the Navy and Marines I (Property of Deceased) Act, 1865, and the. Admiralty (Powers, &d.) Act, 1865, to such pensions, gratuities, and allowances, and doubts may also arise as to the effect of any Order in Council made in pursuance of the above-mentioned Acte so far as regards the restoration of a pension forfeited by Conviction for. crime, and it is expedient to remove such doubts:

An Act to declare the Law relating to the Incorporation of Chartered Companies. [14th August 1884.1

WHEREAS by an Act of 'the first year of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter seventy-three, entitled " An Act for " better enabling Her Majesty to confer certain powers and immunities on trading and other-companies," it was enacted that it should be lawful for Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, in any charter of incorporation to be thereafter granted to limit the duration thereof for any term or number of years, or for any other period whatsoever:

And whereas provision has in many charters of incorporati(ffl been made for the cessation of the privileges conferred by such charters after a limited time:

And whereas with a view of preventing the cessation of such privileges, supplemental charters and warrants and documents under the sign' manual of Her Majesty have from time to time been granted, continuing for a further limited time the privileges granted by the said charters, or some of such privileges, and it is expedient to remove doubts with respect to such charters, warrants, and other documents:

Be it declared and enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

Power of Her i. The enactment contained in the twenty-ninth section of the, rmeifterms of Act of the first year of Her Majesty, chapter seventy-three,

charters. shall be construed as from the date thereof to have authorised and to authorise Her Majesty, by charter or by warrant or other writing under her sign-manual, from time to time, and whensoever to Her Majesty may have seemed or seem expedient, to extend or renew conditionally or unconditionally any term or number of years or other period for which any charter of incorporation granted by Her Majesty, or any privileges of such charter may for the time being be limited to endure.

«2 Vict. c. 26. WHEREAS by the Superannuation Act, 1859, it is enacted that Vy for the purposes of that Act no' person thereafter to b® appointed shall be deemed to have served in the Permanent Civil Service of the State unless such person holds his appointment directly from the Crown, or has been admitted into the Civil Service with a certificate from the Civil Service Commissioners:

And whereas it appears that in several public departments of the State persons have been appointed since the passing of the said Act to established situations in the Civil Service not held directly fro©

1884. Superannuation Act, 1884. v;h. 57. i<ji

the'Crown, but that through inadvertence on the part of the heads of such departments, and without any default on the part of the persons so appointed, no steps were taken before their appointment to procure for them certificates from the Civil Service Commissioners:

And .whereas with a view of relieving such persons from loss of the superannuation allowance or gratuities which they were led to expect when they entered the Civil Service, provision was made by the Superannuation Act Amendment Act, 1873, enabling the Com- 36 & 37 Vict. missioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, on applications by the heads c-23* of such departments, by order or warrant, to place such persons in the same position as regards their claim to a superannuation allowance or gratuity as they would have been in if they had been admitted into the Civil Service with, a certificate from the Civil Service Commissioners:

And whereas a further provision to the like effect was made by die Superannuation (Post Office and War Office) Act, 1876, and the 39g& 40 Vict

And whereas notwithstanding that most of the said persons have been relieved by orders or warrants made under the* said Acts, some of them still remain for whom, owing to the failure of the heads of departments to make application within the time limited by the »id Acts, or owing to other causes beyond their own control, relief has not been provided:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

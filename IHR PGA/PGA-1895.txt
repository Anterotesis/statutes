Provision 3. Whereas the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland

as to Suck advanced during the year one thousand eight hundred and

toansaS<3 eighty-one the sum of Three thousand seven hundred and eighty-

six pounds one shilling to the River Suck Drainage Board out of money placed at the disposal of the Commissioners under the 43 & 44 Vict. Relief of Distress (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1880, and the Acts c> 14- amending the same, by the Commissioners of Church Temporalities,

and the sum so advanced was to bear no interest for two years after the date of the advance, but after the expiration of those two years was to bear interest at the rate of one per cent, per annum, and was to be repaid by an annuity of Three pounds eight shillings for every hundred pounds of the advance for thirty-five years, but no payments have yet been made on account of that annuity;

53 & 54 Vict. And whereas by the River Suck Drainage (Provision of Funds) 12- Act, 1890, provision was made fixing the rate of interest on all

advances made by the Commissioners of Public Works to the said Board at three and a quarter per centum per annum, and for the repayment of such advances by an annuity of four pounds ten shillings for every hundred pounds advanced for forty years, and this provision was to take effect notwithstanding anything in any other Act;

And whereas it was not intended that the last recited provision should alter the terms on which the said advance to the River Suck Drainage Board was originally made, and jt is. expedient that those terms should be restored, and further, that provision should be made for enabling the Board to redeem by a present payment the annuity payable in respect of the said advance and any arrears thereof, therefore-^--53 & 54 vict. (1.) Nothing in section three of the River Suck Drainage (Provision of Funds) Act, 1890,shall affect or be held-to have affected the said advance of three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six pounds one shilling by the Commissioners of Public Works to the River Suck Drainage Board, and that advance shall be subject to the same conditions both as -to interest and ns to manner of repayment as if that Act had not been passed:

(2.) The annuity payable in respect of the said advance, and any arrears thereof, may be redeemed by the Eiver Suck Drainage Board by the payment of such sum as the Treasury, with the concurrence of the Irish Land Commission, fix as necessary for such redemption; and any sum so paid for redemption shall be paid over under the direction of the Treasury to the Irish Land Commission, and applied by them as money transferred to them from the Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Ireland:$

13.) The Commissioners of Public Works may, out of money placed at their disposal under this Act, advance to the River Suck Drainage Board the sum fixed as necessary for the redemption of the said annuity and any arrears thereof, and any such advance by the said Commissioners shall be repaid to the Commissioners in manner provided by section three of the 53 & 54 Vict.

And whereas there is also due from the Commissioners of the 50 & 51 Vict. said harbour to the Fishery Board for Scotland- the sum of six c' 37‘ thousand five hundred pounds, but this debt is postponed to the security granted to the Public Works Loan Commissioners in respect of the said debt of sixteen thousand five hundred pounds;

And whereas the Treasury have agreed to accept the sum of one thousand pounds cash in satisfaction of the said two debts, and it is expedient that this agreement be confirmed ;

Therefore the said two debts, including all claims for interest in respect thereof, shall be extinguished,'and the amount thereof shall be deemed a free grant by Parliament. 5

5. Whereas the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland during Bemissionof the years one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, one thousand mteres*

t / < o o */ 7 accrued on

eight hundred and eighty-two, and one thousand eight hundred loan to and eighty-three, made advances amounting in all to the sum of Donegal forty thousand pounds to the West Donegal Railway Company, 5ailway for the purpose of enabling that company to complete the portion of. their railway running between Stranorlar and Druminin, both situated in the county of Donegal, and such advances were repayable within twenty-five years, with interest at the rate of five per cent, (subsequently reduced to four per cent.) per annum ;

And whereas by the Donegal Railway Act, 1892, the West 55 & 56 Vict. Donegal Railway Company was amalgamated with the Finn Valley c- clx1' Railway Company, and the amalgamated companies are now known as the Donegal Railway Company;

And whereas arrears arose by reason of the income of the said portion of the railway for the purpose of completing which the advances were made being insufficient to enable any further sum to be repaid on account of the interest due in respect of the said advances, and it is expedient, for the purpose of enabling the Donegal Railway Company to raise by the issue of stock the sums required for the repayment of the capital of the said advances, to remit the balance remaining unpaid in respect of the interest od the said advances;

Therefore the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland may accept in full discharge of the interest accrued due in respect of the said advances, the sum of eighteen thousand one hundred and four pounds four shillings and sixpence, and the balance of the said interest remaining unpaid is hereby remitted and shall be deemed to be a free grant by Parliament.

Remission 7. Whereas the properties mortgaged as security for the loans

of certain mentioned in Part II. of the schedule to this Act have been sold

labourers01 with the consent of the Treasury, and it is therefore expedient

dwellings that the debts due in respect of the principal sums outstanding on

Works for thirty-five years;

And whereas in calculating such annuity, interest was reckoned at the rate of three and one-half per centum per annum, and it is expedient to reduce the annual amount of the annuity by reducing the rate of interest and extending the term of the annuity: Be it therefore enacted as follows: —

(1.) As from the gale day next after the passing of this Act, any j annuity charged on a holding under section forty-four or section forty-five of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Ad 1870, or section one of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) |

(2.) Provided that the said Commissioners may in any case in which they think the special circumstances justify so. doing, I grant such extension of the term as they think just, so that | the term shall not in any case exceed forty-nine years froto-i the date of the advance, and shall adjust the annuity and vary j the order accordingly.

(3.) Where on the gale day next after the passing of this Act I there are unpaid arrears of instalments of the annuity; in | excess of the instalment due on the said gale day, this sectijM shall not apply to such annuity except upon such order of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury (in this Act referred r, to as “the Treasury”) as herein-after mentioned.

1887. Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1887. Ch. 33. 113

by the order of a portion of the arrears, not being less than the amount of the instalments of the annuity for six months, if so much be due, the remainder of the arrears shall be repayable by such addition to the amount of the annuity for repaying the advance as will repay the said remainder with interest at the rate of three and one-eighth per centum per annum within the period at which the last-mentioned annuity will, by virtue of this Act or otherwise, terminate, and upon such order being made and-portion of arrears paid this section shall apply, and the Commissioners of Works shall make an order accordingly, and by such order charge the holding with the addition to the annuity for the repayment of arrears, and such charge shall have the same priority as the charge on the holding of the annuity in arrear.

And whereas the rate of interest on such mortgages was calculated at not less than four per centum per annum, but has been in some cases reduced to three and one-eighth ..per centum per annum by an order of the Irish Land Commission, under section twenty-three of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885, and it is expedient to provide in other cases for the like reduction in manner provided by this section: Be it therefore enacted as follows,:

(1.) As from the gale day next after the passing of this Act, or any later date specified in an order under this section, the annual amount payable to the Irish Land Commission in respect of any such instalment mortgage as above-mentioned shall, save as herein-after mentioned, be reduced by such amount as is necessary to reduce the rate of. interest from four to three and one-eighth per j-fiehtum per annum, and the term may he extended by the Irish Land Commission, so that it do not exceed** forty-nine years from the date of the mortgage.

And whereas the borrowing powers of the police receiver under the said Act are insufficient to provide for all the aforesaid purposes, and it is expedient to extend those borrowing powers, and otherwise to amend the enactments relating to the .police receiver:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Metropolitan Police Act, 1887, and this Act and the Metropolitan Police Acts, 1829 to 1886, may be cited together as the Metropolitan Police Acts, 1829 to 1887.

is bounded on three sides by land vested or about to be vested in r.*™™ the police receiver, and is believed to be vested in the Board of Works for the Westminster district, and is not required for the purposes for which that board is authorised to hold land, but doubts have been entertained whether that board has power to transfer the said piece of land to the police receiver and to extinguish the lights (if any) of the public over the same, and it is expedient to remove those doubts; be it therefore enacted that the said board may by agreement transfer the said piece of land to the police receiver, and thereupon all public rights (if any) over the said piece of land shall be extinguished.

Ventilation of Rule 1. An adequate amount of ventilation shall be constantly mme. produced in every mine to dilute and render harmless noxious gases

to such an extent that the working places of the shafts, levels, stables, and workings of the mine, and the travelling roads to and from those working places shall be in a fit state for working and passing therein.

In the case of mines required by this Act to be under the control of a certificated manager, the quantity of air in the respective splits or currents shall at least once in every month be measured and entered in a book to be kept for the purpose at the mine.

Rule 2. Where a fire is used for ventilation in any mine newly opened after the passing of this Act, the return air, unless it be so diluted as not to be inflammable, shall be carried off clear of the fire by means of a dumb drift or airway.

Rule 3. Where a mechanical contrivance for ventilation is introduced into any mine after the commencement of this Act, it shall be in such position and placed under such conditions as will tend to ensure its being uninjured by an explosion.

Stations and Rule A A station or stations shall be appointed at the entrance

co^tionaMo ^e m^ne> or to different parts of the mine, as the case may

ventilation, &c. require ; and the following provisions shall have effect:

A competent person or competent persons appointed by the owner agent or manager for the purpose not being contractors for getting minerals in the mine shall, within such time immediately before the commencement of each shift as shall be fixed by special rules made under this Act, inspect every part of the mine situate beyond the station or each of the stations, and in which workmen are to work or pass during that shift, and shall ascertain the condition thereof so far as the presence of gas ventilation, roof and sides, and general safety are concerned.

No workman shall pass beyond any such station until the part of the mine beyond that station has been so examined and stated by such competent person to be safe.

The inspection shall be made with a locked safety lamp, except in the case of any mine in which inflammable gas has not been found within the preceding twelve months.

A report specifying where noxious or inflammable gas, if any, was found present, and what defects (if any) in roofs or sides, and

287

\Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1887.

what (if any) other source of danger were or was observed, shall be recorded without delay in a book to be kept at the mine for the purpose, and accessible to the workmen, and such report shall be signed by, and so far as the same does not consist of printed matter shall be in the handwriting of the person who made the inspection.

For the purpose of the foregoing provisions of this rule, two or more shifts succeeding one another without any interval are to be deemed to be one shift.

(ii.) As to inspection during shifts: —

A similar inspection shall be made in the course of each shift of all parts of the mine in which workmen are to work or pass during that shift, but it shall not be necessary to record a report of the same in a book: Provided that in the case of a mine worked continuously throughout the twenty-four hours by a succession of shifts, the report of one of such inspections shall be recorded in manner above required.

Eule 5. A competent person or. competent persons appointed Inspection of by the owner agent or manager for the purpose, shall, once at &c'

least in every twenty-four hours, examine the state of the external below ground, parts of the machinery, the state of the guides and conductors in the shafts, and the state of the head gear, ropes, chains, and other similar appliances of the mine which are in actual use both above ground and below ground, and shall once at least in every week examine the state of the shafts by which persons ascend or descend; and shall make a true report of the result of such examination, and every such report shall be recorded without delay in a book to be kept at the mine for the purpose, and shall be signed by the person who made the inspection.

Eule 6. Every entrance to any place which is not in actual Fencing of use or course of working and extension, shall be properly fenced entrances-across the whole width of the entrance, so as to prevent persons inadvertently entering the same.

Eule 7. If at any time it is found by the person for the time Withdrawal of being in charge of the mine, or any part thereof, that by reason of inflammable gases prevailing in the mine, or that part thereof, c se 0 a g or of any cause whatever, the mine or that part is dangerous, every workman shall be withdrawn from the mine or part so found dangerous, and a competent person appointed for the purpose shall inspect the mine or part so found dangerous, and if the danger arises from inflammable gas shall inspect the mine or part with a locked safety lamp ; and in every case shall make a. true report of the condition of the mine or part; and a workman shall not, except in so far as is necessary for inquiring into the cause of danger or for the removal thereof, or for exploration, be re-admitted into the mine, or part so found dangerous, until the same is stated by the person appointed as aforesaid not to be dangerous. Every such report shall be recorded in a book which shall be kept at the mine for the purpose, and shall be signed by the person who made the inspection.

Eule 8. No lamp or light other than a locked safety lamp shall Use of safety be allowed or used — Sb places.

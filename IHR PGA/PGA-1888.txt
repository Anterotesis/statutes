WHEREAS by the Westminster Abbey Act, 1886, the Dean 49 & so Vict.

and Chapter of the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter West- alii!-minster (in this Act referred to as the Dean and Chapter of Westminster) were authorised to borrow, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England (in this Act referred to as the Ecclesiastical Commissioners) were authorised to lend, on the security of the revenues of the Dean and Chapter, or of part thereof, such capital sums not exceeding ten thousand pounds in the whole as the Commissioners might consider to be required for the restoration or repair of Westminster Abbey and the buildings attached thereto:

And whereas by the said Act the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were authorised, if satisfied that the revenues of the Dean and Chapter would not suffice to repay the principal of or pay the interest on the aforesaid sum, to make a grant of such portion thereof as should be necessary for the preservation of the building, provided that the repairs and restorations on which the grant was expended should have been approved by the said Commissioners :

(6.) the stipends of the dean and canons, and

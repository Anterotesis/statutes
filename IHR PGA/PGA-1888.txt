And whereas the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have in pursuance of the said Act paid a sum of seven thousand five hundred pounds to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, and have agreed to pay a further sum of two thousand five hundred pounds, and the Commissioners are satisfied that the revenues of the Dean and Chapter will not suffice to repay the principal of or pay the interest on any part of the aforesaid sum of ten thousand pounds, without some diminution of the charges on such revenues or unduly infringing on the annual sum available for the current repairs of Westminster Abbey and the buildings attached thereto, and it is expedient to authorise the Commissioners to make a grant of the whole of the said sum of ten thousand pounds:

And whereas in view of the present insecure condition of Westminster Abbey the said sum of ten thousand pounds is insufficient for the proper restoration and repair of the Abbey and the buildings attached thereto, and it is expedient to make further provision with a view to such restoration and repair:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:$

(2.) The said property of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster to be so transferred shall include all annual sums at the passing of this Act payable to the Dean and Chapter by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but shall not include the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter or the precincts thereof, designated the Parish of the Close of the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter, Westminster, nor shall it include any ecclesiastical, educational, or other like patronage, and the Dean and Chapter shall retain such church and precincts with all buildings thereon, and such patronage.

And whereas the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have in pursuance of the said Act paid a sum of seven thousand five hundred pounds to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, and have agreed to pay a further sum of two thousand five hundred pounds, and the Commissioners are satisfied that the revenues of the Dean and Chapter will not suffice to repay the principal of or pay the interest on any part of the aforesaid sum of ten thousand pounds, without some diminution of the charges on such revenues or unduly infringing on the annual sum available for the current repairs of Westminster Abbey and the buildings attached thereto, and it is expedient to authorise the Commissioners to make a grant of the whole of the said sum of ten thousand pounds:

And whereas in view of the present insecure condition of Westminster Abbey the said sum of ten thousand pounds is insufficient for the proper restoration and repair of the Abbey and the buildings attached thereto, and it is expedient to make further provision with a view to such restoration and repair:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:$

(2.) The said property of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster to be so transferred shall include all annual sums at the passing of this Act payable to the Dean and Chapter by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but shall not include the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter or the precincts thereof, designated the Parish of the Close of the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter, Westminster, nor shall it include any ecclesiastical, educational, or other like patronage, and the Dean and Chapter shall retain such church and precincts with all buildings thereon, and such patronage.

(3.) After the date fixed by the Order in Council ratifying any such scheme, and without any further conveyance or act in the law, the property expressed by the scheme to be transferred shall vest in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and their successors for the same estate and interest, and subject to the same covenants, restrictions and liabilities expressly affecting the property transferred for and subject to which it was held at the said date by the Dean and

Chapter, but discharged from any general liability of the Dean and Chapter, and any such general liability shall attach to and be discharged out of the annual money payment in consideration of which the transfer is made.

(4.) Sections five, seven, and eight of the Ecclesiastical Commission Act, 1868, shall apply to such transfer as if it were a transfer made under section three of that Act.

(6.) The scheme shall provide that the income derived by the Dean and Chapter from any building which is not for the time being occupied as an official house shall be carried to and form part of the fabric fund.

4. — (1.) The scheme under this Act shall establish a fabric fund Provision of of such annual amount as appears to be sufficient to keep West- abnc 1111 ' minster Abbey, and the buildings attached thereto, in good substantial repair, and the scheme shall apportion the annual income of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster between —

(a.) the fabric fund,

(6.) the stipends of the dean and canons, and

(c.) the maintenance of the services of the collegiate church, and other expenses of the Dean and Chapter.

(2.) The fabric fund shall be a first charge on the revenues of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, and shall be set apart in such manner as may be from time to time approved by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners upon the application of the Dean and Chapter, and the dean and canons shall not be entitled to receive for their own use any sum out of the said capitular revenues until the fabric fund, or a proper proportion thereof, has been set apart in accordance with this Act.

The provisions of this section shall apply to proceedings subsequent as well as prior to an adjudication by the Court of Bankruptcy or the local bankruptcy court. All such estate and effects as would vest in the official assignees of the Court of Bankruptcy if the proceedings had « been instituted in that court shall vest in the official assignee of the local bankruptcy court where the proceedings are instituted in the local court; and where proceedings instituted or pending in either the Court of Bankruptcy or the local bankruptcy court are transferred therefrom to the other of the said courts, then the estate or effects which prior to such transfer were vested in consequence of such proceedings in the official assignees or assignee of the court in which the proceedings were instituted or pending shall by virtue of such transfer become vested in the assignees or assignee of the court to which the proceedings are transferred. If the official assignees or assignee of the court from which such proceedings have been transferred held such property, estate, or effects jointly with any other person or persons, the official assignees or assignee of the court to which such proceedings have been transferred shall also hold same jointly with such person or persons. Any order by th^pourt of Bankruptcy or a judge thereof under the provisions herein contained may be appealed against in the same manner as any other order of such court or judge.

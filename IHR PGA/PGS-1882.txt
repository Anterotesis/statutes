. [19th June 1882.]

WHEREAS by an Act of. the Parliament of Ireland of the I thirty-second year of the -reign of George the Third, chapter twenty-four, intituled “An Act for the better enabling certain 32 G.8.c. 24. ‘Sdper'sons toopen and work mines, and to raise-coal, culm, minerals,

And whereas , by an Act passed in the twenty-sixth year of the 26&27 Vict. reign of Her Majesty the* Queen,1 intituled d? An Act for the Amali c-coix- gamation of the' Hibernian; Mine Company with the Wicklow Copper Mine Qompany (-Limited), and for other purposes; ” after reciting simongst other j things the said Act, and that the property of the Hibernian Company comprised the quays of the harbour of Arklow, With all the wharves; and buildings thereon held in fee; and jthait the Hibernian Company had expended more than seventeen thOusaind poimds on works -for the improvement .of the said harbour and for making itifit for the reception of vessels and the landing and shipping of .goods ; and reciting that on the second day of Eebruatty one ithoiisand eight hundred and fifty-eight the Wicklow CopjferiMine Company was registered under the-Joint Stock Com* 19 & 20 Vict pames'Aetj,fl'M6,<as a Company with limited liability;- and that-the « 47> two Companies were desirous and it was expedient that the two flfempanies and their respective undertaking property, and effects t should be amalgamated, it is enacted that oh the-'first .day‘of "Sep* iember pne thousand eight hundred and sixty-three the two Companies should;beithereby amalgamated into a new Company, which, b$th& riame^ [“itfue Wicklow Copper Mine Company,” should be one body ;oorpprate with the powers thereby given; and that the recited Act; .bf -^thS,-Parliament of Ireland of the thirty-seepnd year! of George the Third, chapter twenty-four, relating to. the Hibernian Company should'hbhhp'baled, and that all' the estates and property, including: the harbour; of Arklow, of which the ; two Companies respectively iwere seised^ or possessed, should be vested in the Wioklow Copper; Mine Company:

TXTHERE AS an institution known as the Provident Branch of * » the Bombay Civil Fund .(founded on the Bombay Civil Fund of earlier date) was established in Bombay under the authority given by the Court of Directors of the East India Company in a public despatch to the Governor in Council at Bombay, dated the thirty-first of December one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four, the said Provident Branch having a separate capital for making provision for such of the civil servants of the said company as should be obliged by ill-health to leave India either temporarily or permanently, and for the granting of annuities to the widows and children of its members and of portions for the children of members, and the said fund was supported by the subscriptions of the civil servants of the said company and by certain contributions from the said company:

And whereas in a financial despatch to the Government of India, dated the twenty-first of July one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, certain changes respecting the grant of annuities to widows were authorised by the Secretary of State for India in Council, and certain terms were stated on which the Secretary of State for India in Council was willing to take over the assets, liabilities, and management of the said institution:

And whereas in accordance With the instructions contained in the aforesaid despatch the Government of. India caused the inquiry to be made, whether upon the terms offered by the Secretary of State for India in Council in the said despatch the subscribers to the said fund were willing to surrender the accumulated fund to the Secretary of State for India in Council, and the proposition so to make over the accumulated fund on the terms offered by the Secretary of State for India in Council was carried in the affirmative by the subscribers by a large majority of votes:

(2.) When it is overdue, or after it has been dishonoured by a I previous refusal to accept, or by non-payment:

(3.) When a bill payable after sight is dishonoured by non-acceptance, and the drawee subsequently accepts it, the holder, in the absence of any different agreement, is entitled to have the bill accepted as of the date of first presentment to the drawee for acceptance.

19. (1.) An acceptance is either (a) general or (b) qualified] 1)

(2.) A general acceptance assents without qualification to the

order of the drawer. A qualified acceptance in express terms varies the effect of the bill as drawn.

In particular an acceptance is qualified which is.

(a.) conditional, that is to say, which makes payment by the acceptor dependent on the fulfilment of a condition therein stated:

(6.) partial, that is to say, an acceptance to pay part only of the amount for which the bill is drawn :

. (c.) local, that is to say, an i acceptance to pay only at a particular specified place:

An acceptance to pay at a particular place is a general acceptance, 1101688 it expressly states that the bill is to be .paid there only and not elsewhere:

(d.) qualified as to time :

(e.) the acceptance of some one or more of the drawees, but not of all.

20. (1.) Where a simple signature on a blank stamped paper is delivered by the signer in order that it may be converted into a bill, it operates as a prima facie authority to fill it up as a complete bill for any amount the stamp will cover, using] the signature for that of the drawer, or the acceptor, or an indorser; and, in like manner, when a bill is wanting in any material particular, the person in possession of it has a prima facie authority to fill up the omission in any way he thinks fit.

(2.) In order that any such instrument when completed may be enforceable against any person who became a party thereto prior to its completion, it must be filled up within a reasonable time, and strictly in accordance with the authority given.' Reasonable time for this purpose is a question of fact.

Provided that if any such instrument after completion is negotiated to a holder in due course it shall be. valid and effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as if it had been filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.

21. (1.) Every contract on a bill, whether it be the drawees,: the acceptor's, or an indorser's, is incomplete and revocable;, until delivery of the instrument in order to give effect thereto. 3

(2.) As between immediate parties, and as regards a remote party other than a holder in due course, the delivery —

(a.) in order to be effectual must be made either by or under the authority of the party drawing, accepting, or indorsing, as the case may be:

(&.) may be shown to have been conditional or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill.

But if the bill be in the hands of a holder in due course a valid delivery of the bill by all parties prior to him so as to make them liable to him is conclusively presumed.

(3.) Where a bill is no longer in the possession of a party who has signed it as drawer, acceptor, or indorser, a valid and unconditional delivery by him is presumed until the contrary is proved.

Capacity and Authority of Parties.

22. (1.) Capacity to incur liability as a party to a bill is co-ex- Capacity of

Provided that nothing in this section shall enable a corporation to make itself liable as drawer, acceptor, or indorser of a bill unless it is competent to it so to do under the law for the time being in force relating to corporations.

(2.) Where a bill is drawn or indorsed by an infant, minor, or corporation having no capacity or power to incur liability on a bill, the drawing or indorsement entitles the holder to receive payment, of the bill, and to enforce it against any other party thereto.

23. No person is liable as drawer, indorser, or acceptor of a bill Signature

who has not signed it as such : Provided that to

(1.) Where a person signs a bill in a trade or assumed name, he is liable thereon as if he had signed it in his own name :

(2.) The signature of the name of a firm is equivalent to the signature by the person so signing of the names of all persons liable as partners in that firm.

24. Subject to the provisions of this Act, where a signature on a Forged or bill is forged or placed thereon without the authority of the person a“tt^ised whose signature it purports to be, the forged or unauthorised signa- Slgna ' ture is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the bill or to give

a discharge therefor or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto can be acquired through or under that signature, unless the party against whom it is sought to retain or enforce payment of the bill is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority.

Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the ratification of an unauthorised signature not amounting to a forgery.

25. A signature by procuration operates as notice that the agent Procuration has but a limited authority to sign, and the principal is only bound slSnatures-by such signature if the agent in so signing was acting within the

The Consideration for a Bill. 27. (1.) Valuable consideration for a bill may be constituted s — (a.) Any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract; (h.) An antecedent debt or liability. Such a debt or liability is deemed valuable consideration whether the bill is payable on demand or at a future time. (2.) Where value has at any time been given for a bill the holder is deemed to be a holder for value as regards the acceptor and all parties to the bill who became parties prior to such time. (8.) Where the holder of a bill has a lien on it arising either from contract or by implication of law, he is deemed to be a holder for value to the extent of the sum for which he has a lien.

Accommodation bill or party. 28. (1.) An accommodation party to a bill is a person who has signed a bill as drawer, acceptor, or indorser, without receiving value therefor, and for the purpose of lending his name to some other person. (2.) An accommodation party is liable on the bill to a holder for value; and it is immaterial whether, when such holder took the bill, he knew such party to be an accommodation party or not.

Holder in due 29. (1.) A holder in due course is a holder who has taken a bill,

course. complete and regular on the face of it, under the following conditions ; namely, (a.) That he became the holder of it before it was overdue, and without notice that it had been previously dishonoured, if such was the fact: (b.) That he took the bill in good faith and for value, and that at the time the bill was negotiated to him he had no notice of any defect in the title of the person who negotiated it. (2.) In particular the title of a person who negotiates a bill is defective within the meaning of this Act when he obtained the bill, or the acceptance thereof, by fraud, duress, or force and fear, or other unlawful means, or for an illegal consideration, or when he negotiates it in breach of faith, or under such circumstances as amount to a fraud. (3.) A holder (whether for value or not), who derives his title to a bill through a holder in due course, and who is not himself a party to any fraud or illegality affecting it, has all the rights of that holder in due course as regards the acceptor and all parties to the bill prior to that holder.

Presumption of 30. (1.) Every party whose signature appears on a bill is prima faith.6 aud S°°d ^ac*e deemed to have become a party thereto for value.

(2.) Every holder of a bill is prinui facie deemed to be a holder in due course ; but if in an action on a bill it is admitted or proved that the acceptance, issue, or subsequent negotiation of the bill is affected with fraud, duress, or force and fear, or illegality, the burden of proof is shifted,-unless and until the holder proves that,

1882. Bills of Exchange Act, 1882. Ch. 61. 373

subsequent to the alleged fraud or illegality, value has in good faith been given for the bill.

Negotiation of Bills.

31. (1.) A bill is negotiated when it is transferred from one Negotiation of person to another in such a manner as to constitute the transferee bil1-

the holder of the bill.

(2.) A bill payable to bearer is negotiated by delivery.

(3.) A bill payable to order is negotiated by the indorsement of the holder completed by delivery.

(4.) Where the holder of a bill payable to his order transfers it for value without indorsing it, the transfer gives the transferee such title as the transferor had in the bill, and the transferee in addition acquires the right to have the indorsement of the transferor.

(5.) Where any person is under obligation to indorse a bill in a representative capacity, he may indorse the bill in such terms as to negative personal liability.

32. An indorsement in order to operate as a negotiation must Requisites of a

comply with the following conditions, namely, — mtlorse'

(1.) It must be written on the bill itself and be signed by the indorser. The simple signature of the indorser on the bill, without additional words, is sufficient.

An indorsement written on an allonge, or on a “ copy ” of a bill issued or negotiated in a country where “ copies ” are recognised, is deemed to be written on the bill itself.

(2.) It must be an indorsement of the entire bill. A partial indorsement, that is to say, an indorsement which purports to transfer to the indorsee a part only of the amount payable, or which purports to transfer the bill to two or more indorsees-severally does not operate as a negotiation of the bill.

(3.) Where a bill is payable to the order of two or more payees-or indorsees who are not partners all must indorse, unless the one indorsing has authority to indorse for the others.

(4.) Where, in a bill payable to order, the payee or indorsee is-wrongly designated, or his name is mis-speit, he may indorse the bill as therein described, adding, if he think fit, his proper signature.

(5.) Where there are two or more indorsements on a bill, each, indorsement is deemed to have been made in the order in which it appears on the bill, until the contrary is proved.

(6.) An indorsement may be made in blank or special. It may also contain terms making it restrictive.

33. Where a bill purports to be indorsed conditionally the con-Conditional dition may be disregarded by the payer, and payment to the indorsement, indorsee is valid whether the condition has been fulfilled or not.

(2.) A special indorsement specifies the person to whom, or to ||jgg!in orse~ whose order, the bill is to be payable.

(3.) The provisions of this Act relating to a payee apply with the necessary modifications to an indorsee under a special indorsement.

(4.) When a bill has been indorsed in blank, any holder may convert the blank indorsement into a special indorsement by

(which provided for annual and quarterly statements from borrowers annual and quar-of the amounts which they will probably apply to borrow), are QfamounUre-tb hereby repealed.

10. Whereas by section twenty-eight of the Land Law (Ireland) Amendment as Act, 1881, it is provided that any advance made by the Irish Land ^vance^ot * of Commission for the purpose therein mentioned shall be repaid by g. 28 of

an annuity in favour of the Land Commission for thirty-five years 44 & 45 Vict-of five pounds for every one hundred pounds of such advance, and c‘49' so in proportion for any less sum, and further that every such advance shall be secured to the Commission either in such manner as may be agreed upon or in manner provided by Part Three of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, as amended by the 33 & 84 Vict.

And whereas in pursuance of the last-mentioned Acts the annuity c. 32. is repayable by equal half-yearly payments on the first day of May and the first day of November in every year, and the necessary apportionment is made in respect of the first and last of such payments.

And whereas it is expedient to make such different provision respecting the said annuity as herein-after mentioned: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Where any advance repayable by an annuity under section twenty-eight of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, has either before or after the passing of this Act been secured in manner provided by Part Three of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, as amended by the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1872, the first half-yearly payment of the annuity shall, where the advance is not made on one of the gale days (namely, the first day of May or the first day of November), be due and paid on the second of such gale days after the date of the advance, and together with such first half-yearly payment there shall be due and paid an additional sum for interest on the advance at the rate of three and a half per cent, per annum from the date of the advance, until the first gale day next after that date.

Provision as to 'certain Loans.

11. Whereas the Public Works Loan Commissioners, under the Harbours and Passing Tolls Act, 1861, advanced in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, and subsequent years, to the British Fisheries Society for Pulteney Town Harbour in Wick Bay sums amounting in the whole to sixty-two thousand pounds, which sums were expended on a breakwater and works for the harbour, and, with interest at the rate of three and a quarter per cent, per annum, are repayable out of the revenues of the harbour by annuities amounting in the whole to two thousand six hundred and forty-two pounds five shillings, and terminating between the years one thousand nine hundred and eighteen and one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three; and by the payment of such annuities the capital sum due has been reduced to fifty-seven thousand eight hundred and twenty-one pounds thirteen shillings and twopence.

And whereas the harbour and the revenues thereof were, in pursuance of an Act of Parliament, transferred by the British Fisheries Society to the Pulteney Harbour trustees, and the said Act charged the above annuities on the revenue of the harbour next after; an annual sum of sixteen hundred pounds for the maintenance and management of the harbour.

And whereas the breakwater and works upon which the said sums were expended have been almost wholly destroyed by the violence of the sea, and in consequence of the injury thereby caused to the harbour and other causes, the revenue of the harbour, upon which the said annuities are charged has been diminishing.

And whereas with a view to the restoration of the said works or other improvement of the harbour, it is expedient to raise further loans and to empower the Treasury, on being satisfied of the circumstances herein-after mentioned, to authorise such postponement of the said annuities due to the Public Works Loan Commissioners, as is herein-after mentioned: Be it therefore enacted as follows:' I

If the Pulteney Harbour trustees satisfy the Treasury that works for the restoration of the destroyed breakwater and works or otherwise for the improvement of Pulteney Harbour would be of public utility, and that such works can be executed for a reasonable sum, the Treasury may authorise the Public Works Loan Commissioners to agree that notwithstanding anything in the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, any loan or loans to be borrowed for the said works should, to such amount -(not exceeding the said sum) and on such conditions as may seem expedient, have priority over the advances made by the Public Works Loan Commissioners before the passing of this Act, and the interest thereon, and may further authorise them to agree with the Pulteney Harbour trustees that the payments on account of the said advances, and the interest thereon, should be wholly or partly suspended during such number of years as may be agreed upon.

The Public Works Loan Commissioners may advance the said new loan or loans if they are satisfied with the sufficiency of the security for the same, irrespective of the said advances and interest hereby authorised to be postponed.

And whereas after the passing of the above Act the government c-2#-of Canada issued to the public, with the option of inscription at any time in books kept in the United Kingdom, the loans mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act; and holders of the said loans before the passing of the Inland Revenue Act, 1880, had exercised 432q 44 v,ct' that option to the extent in the said Schedule mentioned, and the government of Canada had paid composition for the stamp duty accordingly:

And whereas by section fifty-four of the Inland Revenue Act,

1880, the amount of the composition for stamp duty chargeable on transfers of stock of the government of Canada and other stock was increased, subject to a proviso that such increased composition should not apply for twelve months in the case of the holders of debentures of the government of a colony who had an option to exchange such debentures within twelve months for colonial stock, to which the Colonial Stock Act, 1877, applied: 405* 41 vict-

And whereas, having regard to the special circumstances connected with the issue of the stock mentioned in the said Schedule, it is expedient to make for the holders of that stock a similar provision to that made by the above-mentioned proviso in the case of the holders of colonial stock :

Be it therefore enacted as follows : ,

Where at any time since the passing of the Inland Revenue Act, 1880, whether before or after the passing of this Act, but before the first day of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, any part of the loans of the government of Canada mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act, has been inscribed as stock in books kept in the United Kingdom, the government of Canada may pay to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, by way of composition for the stamp duty chargeable on transfers of such stock, a sum calculated at the rate mentioned in the Canadian Stock Stamp Act, 1874, instead of the rate mentioned in the Inland Revenue Act, 1880.

And whereas fractions of a penny have never been paid by the JjfridLdsof the Governor and Company of the Bank of England on account of the National Debt, dividends on the national debt, and the fractions so unpaid have accumulated in the hands of the governor and company of the Bank of England, and such accumulations amount, as shown by the account in the Third Schedule to this Act, to upwards of one hundred and forty thousand pounds.

And whereas the sums issued out of the Exchequer to the governor and company of the Bank of England for payment of the dividends exceed, as shown in the said account, the sums paid for

dividends, and out of the sums so issued a net sum of upwards of seven hundred thousand pounds, as shown by the said account, has been repaid to the Exchequer in pursuance of the enactments referred to in the said Schedule and was on the thirty-first March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two outstanding in the books of the Bank of England.

And whereas it is expedient to make such provision as hereinafter appearing, respecting the said accumulations of fractions of a penny. Be it therefore enacted as follows: —

The governor and company of the Bank of England shall from time to time, when required by the Treasury, certify to the Treasury the amount in their hands arising from fractions of a penny not paid on account of dividends on the national debt, and the Treasury may by warrant direct the said governor and company to repay the same to the Exchequer: Provided that so long as there is an account outstanding of money repaid into the Exchequer, as aforesaid, out of the sums issued for the payment of dividends, the same instead of being repaid shall be written off from the said account, and also from the account of the sums issued from the Exchequer for the payment of the said dividends, and such amount shall be written off as if it had never been issued from the Exchequer.

19. After such date as the Treasury may appoint the dividends payable in respect of the two pounds ten shillings per centum annuities mentioned in the first schedule to the National Debt Act, 1870, shall be paid quarterly, on the fifth day of January, the fifth day of April, the fifth day of July, and the fifth day of October in every year, and the said Act shall be construed accordingly; and references therein to a half year's dividend shall be construed to refer as regards the two pounds ten shillings per centum annuities to a quarter's dividend.

Regulations may be made under section thirty-nine of the said Act for carrying into effect such quarterly payments in the case of stock certificates, and for the return of old coupons and the issue of new coupons for that purpose.

20. Whereas under the Acts mentioned in the Fourth Schedule to this Act (in this section referred to as the Fortification Acts) divers sums amounting in the whole to seven million four hundred and sixty thousand pounds were authorised to be borrowed by the Treasury by the creation of terminable annuities, and to be applied under the direction of one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State towards defraying the expenses of constructing the fortifications mentioned in the Fortification Acts:

And whereas of the above sums the sum of seven million four hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds has been actually raised in pursuance of the Fortification Acts by means of loans from the National Debt Commissioners made on the security of terminable annuities created under the said Acts, and the balance of thirty-five thousand pounds has not been raised:

And whereas out of the sums raised by such loans a balance of four thousand and eighty pounds one shilling and tenpence is unexpended :

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the disposal of the said unexpended balance and to extinguish the said power of

431

raising money and creating terminable annuities: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Such portion of the amount raised in pursuance of the Fortification Acts as at the passing of this Act has not been expended shall at such time as the Treasury may direct be paid to the National Debt Commissioners in repayment of an equivalent part of the loans made by them under the said Acts ; and so much of the annuities created under the Fortification Acts and standing in the names of those Commissioners as the Controller General or Assistant Controller and the Actuary of the National Debt Office may certify under their hands to be equivalent to the amount of such repayment shall be cancelled in such manner as the Treasury may direct.

All power of raising any money under the Fortification Acts shall cease and the Fortification Acte shall be repealed;

Provided that —

(1.) All annuities created in pursuance of the said Acte shall, save as provided by this section, continue to be charged on the Consolidated Fund and paid as if the said Acte had not been repealed; and

(2.) All land vested in one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State in pursuance of the said Act shall continue to be vested in such Secretary of State on behalf of Her Majesty.

21. Whereas by divers Acte and lastly by the Friendly Societies 38 & 39 Vict. Act, 1875, the societies in those Acte and this Act referred to as c- 60' s‘17-friendly societies are authorised to invest the moneys received from members on account of assurances with the National Debt Commissioners, and to pay such moneys to those Commissioners in sums of not less than fifty pounds, and are entitled to receive receipts for such moneys bearing interest at the following rates; that is to say,

For money invested by any society legally established before the 28th day of Jnly 1828, which invested money with the Commissioners before 23rd July 1855.

For money invested by any society legally established between the 28th day of July 1828, and the 15th day of August 1850, which . invested any money with the Commissioners before 23rd July 1855.

And'whereas the Commissioners have from time to time invested the moneys so paid to them in parliamentary securities to an account entitled the fund for Friendly Societies, but such securities have produced less interest than that to which the societies were entitled as above-mentioned, and thereby there has been, as appears from the returns annually laid before Parliament, a gradually increasing deficiency in the value of the securities held by the National Debt Commissioners on the said account to meet the sums due from those Commissioners to the Friendly Societies:

And whereas the Customs, Inland Revenue, and Savings Banks Act, 1877, provided that the National Debt Commissioners shall annually make out an account with respect to the year ending on the twentieth day of November, showing on one side the interest accrued from the said securities, and on the other side the interest paid and credited to Friendly Societies; and further, after reciting that it was intended that where the interest accrued from such securities in any year was insufficient to meet the interest required to be paid and credited, such deficiency should be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, the said Act provided for paying into the Exchequer any surplus of interest received over and above the interest paid and credited:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the payment out of the Consolidated Fund of all capital sums, as well as the interest due from the National'Debt Commissioners to Friendly Societies, when the securities held on account of Friendly Societies by the said Commissioners to meet the same have been exhausted:

Be it therefore enacted, as follows:

(1.) Whenever it appears to the Treasury from time to time that by reason of the securities held by the National Debt Commissioners on account of Friendly Societies being exhausted, the moneys in the hands of the National Debt Commissioners standing to the credit of the fund for - Friendly Societies will be insufficient to meet the sums which are likely to become due from the National Debt Commissioners to Friendly Societies, the Treasury shall provide money to meet the deficiency out of the Consolidated fWd of the United Kingdom, or the growing produce thereof, in such manner as they may think expedient.

(2.) The Treasury may in any financial year borrow all or any part of the moneys issued in that financial year out of the Consolidated Fund, or the growing produce thereof, in pursuance of this Act, by means of a terminable annuity for such period not exceeding eighteen years from the thirty-first day of December next after the passing of this Act as the Treasury think expedient.

(3.) An annuity created in pursuance of this section shall be created by warrant of the Treasury to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England directing them to inscribe in their books the amount of such annuity in the names directed by the warrant.

(4.) Every such annuity shall be charged on the Consolidated Fund, and shall be added to and paid out of the permanent annual charge for the National Debt, and the permanent .n.nnim.1 charge for the National Debt shall, during the period for which the said annuity is created .be increased by the amount of the annuity.

All money for the time being in the hands of the National Investment of Debt Commissioners on account of Friendly Societies shall be invested by them in the like manner as if they were moneys in Societies.6 y their hands on account of savings banks, and all enactments relating to the investment of such last-mentioned moneys shall apply accordingly.

22. Whereas under the Prison (Officers Superannuation) Act, Advance of

authority, and it is provided that any sum so paid by the Treasury

shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, and that

any sum so paid to the Treasury shall be paid into the Exchequer,

and it is expedient to make such other provision respecting the said

capital sums as herein-after mentioned; be it therefore enacted as

follows:

(1.) The National Debt Commissioners may, on the request of the Treasury, advance out of any funds for the time being in their hands on account of savings banks any capital sum to be paid by the Treasury in pursuance of the Prison (Officers Superannuation)

Act, 1878.

y.;(2.) Any amount advanced by the National Debt Commissioners in pursuance of this section shall be repaid to them by means of a terminable annuity for a period of ten years, to be calculated with interest at the rate of not less than three and a half per cent, per annum, and such annuity shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament.

(3.) If at any time it appears desirable to the Treasury and to the said Commissioners that a portion of any such advance should be repaid immediately out of the Consolidated Fund, the Treasury may charge on and issue to the said Commissioners out of the Consolidated Fund or the growing produce thereof the said portion, and the annuity shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to the portion of the advance so repaid.

(4.) All capital sums paid to the Treasury by a local authority in pursuance of the Prison (Officers Superannuation) Act, 1878, 38 & 89 Vict. shall be paid to the National Debt Commissioners and shall be c,45> applied by them in like manner as is directed with respect to the old sinking fund by section five of the Sinking Fund Act, 1875.

(5.) The amount of any annuity payable to the National Debt Commissioners in pursuance of this section, and the portion of any advance which is to be repaid immediately out of the Consolidated Fund ...to the National Debt Commissioners, and the amount by which any annuity is to be reduced in consequence of such repayment shall b,e certified under the hands of the Controller General or Assistant Controller and the Actuary of the National Debt Office.

23. Whereas by the Consolidated Fund (Permanent Charges Amendment of Redemption) Act, 1873, the Treasury are authorised as regards

certain annuities as defined by that Act which are charged on the regards perma-Consolidated Fund or moneys provided by Parliament to contract nent charges on for their redemption by payment of a capital sum out of moneys [No. 28. Price 2d] - E e

This folder contains the OCR'd text of the 'Butterworths' edition of the Statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, 1807 to 1820, i.e. continuing from the Danby Pickering edition of the Statutes, up to the end of George III's reign.

I'm calling this the Butterworths edition, as the title page states:
"London: Printed by His Majesty's Statute and Law Printers; And sold by J. Butterworth and Son, Law Booksellers, in Fleet-Street."

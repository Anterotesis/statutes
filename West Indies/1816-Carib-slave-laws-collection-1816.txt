[30th April 17<)S.J -

WHEREAS many evil disposed persons in this Island do, notwithstanding Preamble; sundry satutary laws made for the suppression of runaway slaves, still persist in the pernicious practice of carrying on an intercourse with the runaway slaves, and of supplying them, not only with the necessaries of life, but also with arms and ammunition, whereby the said runaways are enabled to continue in a state of revolt and rebellion, such persons so carrying on an intercourse with and supplying the said runaways as aforesaid, being emboldened in the said wicked practice by the difficulty (the admission of testimony of slaves not being allowable in any case as the law now stands) of convicting them of their said offences; for remedy whereof, we the governor in chief and the council and the assembly of the Island of Dominica do humbly pray your most excellent Majesty, Jhat it may be enacted and ordained,

1st. And be it and it is hereby enacted and ordained by the authority aforesaid,

That no white person or free person of colour, from and after the publication of this Act, shall give sell or barter any gunpowder, lire-arms or other offensive weapons, salt, salt provisions, clothes or other-necessaries whatever, or hold any intercourse or correspondence, directly' or indirectly, to or with any runaway slave or slaves knowing them to be such, under the penalty of being deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, and shall on conviction thereof suffer punishment by tine, pillory, imprisonment and banishment, or any or either of them, at the discretion of the court before whom such white or free person of colour shall be tried and convicted, and such justices are hereby authorized to pronounce judgment of the last-mentioned punishments any or rithcr of them.

2d. And be it and it is hereby enacted and ordained by the authority aforesaid,

That where any person shall be charged or accused of any of the crimes in the preceding clause mentioned, it shall and may be lawful in support of such charge or accusation, to examine as witnesses on their corporal oaths any slave or slaves other than the slave or slaves of the person accused, before any judge, justice of the peace, grand jury or petty jury, in any court within the said Island having cognizance of such offences ; provided always nevertheless, that no white person or free person of colour shall be convicted of any of the offences aforesaid on the testimony of any slaves, unless two of the said slaves at the least, clearly and consistently with each other, depose to the same fact* act or circumstance; and also unless the said slaves are examined apart, and out of the hearing of each other; and provided also, that no white person or free person of colour shall be convicted on the testimony of any slaves of any of the offences aforesaid, unless the same be prosecuted within twelve months after the commission thereof.

3rd. And be it and it is hereby enacted and ordained by the authority aforesaid,

That all male slaves taken after the first day of September in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-seven, at the expense of this colony, or otherwise, who shall have been absent for the space of twelve months previous to the time of their apprehension and commitment, shall be forfeited and banished from the Island by the sentences of the justices who may try them, to any place or places distant from this Island at least twenty-five leagues (unless condemned according to law, on the verdict of a jury by the court who shall try such slave, to suffer death) and such slave or slaves shall be sold by the provost marshal or his deputy, subject to their respective sentences, within three days alter the pronouncing thereof, and the money arising from such sale, after deducting the reasonable charge thereof, and the reward allowed by law for the apprehending such slaves, shall be paid to the owner or owners thereof.

4th. And be it and it is hereby enacted and ordained by the authority aforesaid, ^ That where any slave or slaves shall be sold as aforesaid, subject to a sentence or sentences of banishment, the person or persons purchasing the same, before the. delivery thereof, shall with two sufficient sureties enter into a recognizance with his Majesty, his heirs and successors, before any if his Majesty’s justices of the peace, in double the value of the slave or slaves to be so purchased, conditioned to banish the same, within seven days after the date of such recognizance; and if such slave or slaves shall after the expiration of that space of time remain on this Island, such recognizance shall be deemed forfeited, and shall be sueable and recoverable as other forfeited recognizances to his Majesty now are or may by law be sued and recovered, and the amount of such recognizance shall, when recovered, be paid into the public treasury of this Island for the benefit and uses thereof.

5th. And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all and every person and persons shall and they are hereby enjoined, on discovering or knowing the situation or movement of the runaways or any party thereof, to give the earliest possible information thereof, either to some commander of a party acting against the runaways, or to the commander in chief of this Island; and any person or persons, who shall be credibly informed of, discover or know of the situation or movement of the said runaways or any party thereof, and shall neglect to give information thereof as aforesaid, shall for every such offence, on conviction thereof, if a white person or free person of colour, forfeit the sum of one hundred pounds current money of this Island, to be recovered in any court of record within this Island, and be paid one-half to the person who shall sue for the same, and the other half into the colony treasury of this Island for the public uses thereof; and if a slave, on conviction thereof by any two or more justices of the peace, shall receive such public punishment of flogging not exceeding thirty-nine lashes, as the said justices of the peace in their discretion shall order and adjudge.

6 th. And whereas it often happens that slaves absent themselves from the service of their masters and mistresses upon very slight occasions, and are afterwards employed or harboured by evil-minded white persons and free persons of colour, and sometimes by slaves, whereby such runaways are countenanced and encouraged in continuing absent from their duty; for remedy whereof, be it and it is hereby enacted and ordained by the authority aforesaid,. That after any slave or slaves hath or have absented himself herself or themselves from his her or their owner or employer’s service, every other slave knowing thereof, who shall entertain, employ, harbour, receive or conceal, or any way assist, comfort, afford or give sustenance to any such runaway slave or slaves, shall upon conviction thereof before any justice of the peace of this Island, for such offence be publicly whipped upon the bare breech, with any number of stripes not exceeding thirty-nine; and if any white person or free person of colour shall entertain, employ, hanbour or receive, or any way assist comfort, afford or give sustenance to any such runaway slave or slaves, such white or free person of colour for the first offence, shall forfeit the sum of twenty-five pounds current money, for the second offence fifty pounds, and for the third, imprisonment for a month, and to be put in the pillory once during that time; which several penalties, on conviction of the offender or offenders before any three justices of the peace, shall be recovered by their warrant to the provost marshal, who shall levy, the same in the manner as executions on complaints are levied, and executed out of the court of common pleas, and be entitled to the same fees thereon, and when recovered such penalties shall be paid into the public treasury for the public uses of the colony ; and such offender or offenders shall moreover be liable to an action at the suit of the owner renter or employer of such runaway slave or slaves, for employing harbouring or concealing of such runaway slave or slaves, in which action the jury shall allow to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, in case a verdict shall be found for him her or them, at the rate of twelve shillings per diem, for every day he or she shall be proved to have been runaway and absent as aforesaid, besides full costs of suit; and in all cases of prosecutions for any of the penalties in this clause mentioned, the justices shall admit the testimony of slaves in support of the prosecution, in the same manner as prescribed by the second clause of this Act: provided always, that the said justices shall not examine as witnesses against any offender or offenders, any of his her or their own proper slaves; and if after the publication of this Act, any white or free person of colour shall employ any slave or slaves, who may not have a written permission

8th. Whereas it sometimes happens that slaves who have been guilty of crimes or petty offences are harboured and concealed, so that they cannot be apprehended and speedily brought to justice; for remedying which inconveniences, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That when any warrant or warrants shall be granted by any of the justices of the peace in this Island, for the apprehending of any slave or slaves, the person authorized to apprehend such slave or slaves, if such slave or slaves cannot be immediately found, shall apply to the owner renter or employer of such slaves, who upon notice of such warrant being granted, shall deliver or cause to' be delivered up such slave or slaves to the constable or person authorized to execute it, on pain of forfeiting, in case of neglect or refusal to deliver up such slave or slaves, the sum of twenty pounds for each neglect or refusal, to be recovered by the warrant of any two justices of the peace of the Island, directed to any constable to levy the same on his her or their goods or chattels; but if the owner renter of employer aforesaid, shall make oath in writing that such slave or slaves is or are runaway from his her or their plantation or place of residence, or otherwise cannot be found after diligent .search, then the said justices are hereby directed to take the matters stated in such affidavit into their consideration, and if satisfied that the same are a reasonable excuse, are hereby authorized to remit the fine aforesaid or any part thereof, which fine so recovered, after deducting the necessary expenses of the constable who may be employed to arrest such slave, and also the expenses of the said warrant and the levy thereof, shall be paid by the magistrate who shall receive the same, into the public

WHEREAS, in consequence of the late operation against the runaway slaves, prcambk, who were assembled in the woods of this Island, sundry of them have been taken and others have been compelled to surrender, and they are now confined in the common gaol, and some of them have become forfeited to this colony under several Acts of the legislature thereof: and whereas it is expedient to remove the said slaves from this colony, as well to preserve the tranquility thereof from being again disturbed by them, as by their example to prevent and deter other slaves from the commission of the like offences; be it therefore enacted by the governor, council and assembly of this Island,

1st. And be it and it is hereby enacted and ordained by the authority aforesaid, That the provost marshal of this Island shall with all convenient expedition proceed to sell by public auction to the highest bidder, after notifying such sale by advertisement in the usual manner, all runaway slaves in his custody, who are or have been or shall be declared and adjudged in a due course of law to be forfeited to the colony, on the condition following, that is to say, that the purchasers thereof shall remove the same from this colony, and the said slaves when sold shall remain in gaol at the expense of the purchasers thereof, till they shall find .convenient opportunities for sending the same off from this Island; and if such slave or slaves shall not be sent off accordingly, within forty-eight hours after delivery for that purpose, or shall ever be brought back, or shall return to this colony, the same shall be forfeited to the colony, and shall again be sold in manner aforesaid for the benefit thereof.

2d. And be it and it is hereby enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all'slaves who have been runaways in camps in the woods of this Island, or who have been, runaways and absent from the service of their master above six months, as well those now in confinement os those who have been runaways and have returned to their owners renters or employers within three months last past, but have not been examined or tried by three justices as directed by law, or shall hereafter be taken, or shall surrender (except those who are or shall be forfeited to the colony as aforesaid) shall, after examination by three or more magistrates, and payment of gaol fees, be delivered to their respective masters renters or employers, on the condition of their sending off and removing from this Island all and every such slaves within two months from the time when such slave or slaves shall have been so delivered up, on penalty of forfeiture for the benefit of the colony, of every such slave not so banished and sent off the Island, which slaves so not sent off shall thereupon be liable to be taken up by the warrant of any magistrate and delivered to the provost marshal, to be sold by him on the conditions enacted by the first clause of this Act, and the owner renter or employer of any slave or slaves so ordered to be banished, shall moreover forfeit to the colony the sum of twenty pounds currency, to be recovered and levied on his her or their goods and chattels by the provost marshal, under the warrant of any three justices of~the peace of this Island; provided that so much of this Act as requires the sending off from this Island runaway slaves, shall not extend to slaves under the age of twelve years: And whereas Phurcellc, a negro man, formerly a notorious runaway chief in the woods, and for whose apprehension rewards were offered by several laws of this Island, did some years ago surrender upon terms of serving constantly against the runaways, whenever required so to do by the governor or commander in chief of this Island, on which condition he was to be deemed a free person: And whereas the said Pharcelle, in consequence thereof enjoyed his freedom, but on the lute expedition against the .runaway slaves, being called upon by his excellency the governor to serve as a guide to one of the parties of his Majesty’s black troops employed on that service, he so misbehaved whilst on service that his excellency, upon proof thereof by affidavit in writing, made by the officer commanding the party, thought proper to commit the said Pharcelle to the common gaol, and by message to both houses 226.

And whereas many negroes, mulattoes, and other coloured persons, have, subsequent "to the publication of the said Act, to prevent the sudden increase of free negroes and mulattoes, obtained certificates of their freedom under the hands and seals of two justices of the peace, in manner prescribed by the fifth clause of the said last-mentioned Act: And whereas some of such certificates have been neglected to be recorded in the register’s office within the time prescribed for that purpose by the proviso to the said clause, and others of such certificates have been procured subsequent to the expiration of such time so prescribed by the said proviso, and in both cases it is now impossible to comply with the regulations directed by the said proviso: And whereas it is unnecessary to put such persons as are possessed of such certificates to tiie trouble and expense ofprocuring others in way and manner prescribed by this Act; BE it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That every certificate of freedom of any negro, mulatto, or other coloured person, which antecedent to the publication of this Act, hath been obtained agreeable to, and in the terms of the said fifth clause of the said Act to prevent the sudden increase of free negroes and mulattoes, but without compliance with the requisites prescribed and directed by the said proyiso thereto, shall and the same is hereby declared to be as valid effectual and sufficient both at law and in equity, as if the said proviso to the said fifth clause of the said last-mentioned Act had never been made: Provided always nevertheless, that every person shall and may be at liberty to dispute and counteract the force and effect of every such certificate, by offering and producing such testimony or other proofs as he or she may be possessed of, or have in his or her power for the purpose of disproving the freedom so certified: And provided also, that nothing

herein contained shall deprive any negro, mulatto, or other coloured person, having such last-mentioned certificate or certificates, of the benefit and advantage which lie she or they may have from any other evidence of his her or their freedom, but that every such proof or evidence thereof, other or different from such certificate or certificates, shall and may be admitted and received as evidence in all courts of law and equity in these Islands, in the same manner as the same would have been admitted and received, had this Act and the said Act to prevent the further sudden increase of free negroes and mulattoes never been made.

And whereas many manumissions and other acts of freedom for the purpose of enfranchising slaves, have been made and executed subsequent to the sixth of January one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four, when these Islands were restored to Great Britain, without complying with the requisites and formalities prescribed by the fust, second, and third clauses of the said Act, to prevent the further sudden increase of free negroes, and mulattoes, upon a mistaken idea that the said Act was not then in force: And whereas the said first, second, and third clauses of the said last-mentioned Act, were by two Acts of the legislature of these Islands repealed during the.’continuance of the said Acts, and other regulations thereby established for the manumission and enfranchisement of slaves, which said last-mentioned regulations are now in force: And whereas it would be unjust, under such circumstances, to permit the said Act to prevent the further sudden increase of free negroes and mulattoes, to operate against and destroy the intention and effect of such manumissions or other acts of freedom so made and executed between the said sixth day of January one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four, and the said third day of November one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight; BE.it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, lhat the originals of all manur missions or other acts of freedom, whether by last will and testament or otherwise, after been duly proved according to law, and if proved and recorded in the register’s office of these Islands in manner prescribed by law, then office copies thereof duly certified by the register of these Islands for the time being, or his lawful deputy in manner prescribed by law, shall and may be admitted and received as evidence in all courts of law and equity in these Islands, and shall have and produce the same operation and effect, both at law and in equity, as such manumissions or other acts 226.

And whereas by the twenty-first clause of an Act for the better government of slaves, and for the more speedy, and effectual suppression of run-away slaves, it is enacted amongst other things, that the provost marshal, or his lawful deputy, shall receive into his custody all run-away slaves brought to him, and pay the rewards for the same therein directed, and after making publication respecting every such slave or slaves for six weeks in manner therein prescribed, shall, if such slave or slaves be not claimed within the time aforesaid, sell such slave or slaves at public outcry, and pay the money arising therefrom, after deduction of charges and fees, to the owner or owners of such slave or slaves, and in default of knowing such owner or owners, to the treasurer of these Islands for the time being, for the use of the public, till such time as the owner or owners of such slave or slaves shall appear: And whereas the aforesaid Regulation hath from

of banishment, and confinement in chains to hard labour for life, have in general,

objects who from the enormity of their crimes deserved, and from the rigour of

the law would have been condemned to death, but which humane system would be

SAINT sixth day of April in the thirty-seventh year of your Majesty’s reign, recommended CHRISTOPHER, to their attention by your Majesty’s said commander in chief of your Leeward Char-

----/ ribbee Islands, in obedience .to your Majesty’s order, communicated by his grace the

duke of Portland, one of your Majesty’s principal secretaries of state, and having maturely deliberated upon the measures which appear to them best calculated to obviate the causes which hitherto may have impeded the natural increase of negroes already in these Islands, gradually, as they hope, to diminish the necessity of the slave trade, and ultimately to lead to its final termination, and desiring to grant unto the Slaves in these your Majesty’s Leeward Charribbee Islands every indulgence and encouragement which may tend to their moral and religious improvement, and to secure to them the certain, immediate and active protection of the law, as far as the same -can possibly he extended to them consistently with that good order, discipline and obedience, which is absolutely necessary to preserve and maintain in all places where, from inevitable local circumstances, slavery must, with some restrictions, bo tolerated, and desiring also to prevent as much as possible any instances of cruelty or oppression, and to compel all persons to treat their slaves with that humanity which is generally prevalent in these Islands; Do humbly pray your Most Excellent Majesty that it may be enacted and ordained,

1st. And be it, and it is hereby, enacted and ordained by the authority aforesaid, That every owner or director of any slave or slaves within the Leeward Islands shall weekly and every week, under the penalty of ten shillings per head, for each and every slave under his or her direction, for every omission, purchase or provide, at the rate of the following quantities of provision, that is to say, for every slave at the rate of nine pints of corn or beans, or eight pints of pease, or wheat or rye flour, or Indian corn meal, or nine pints of oatmeal, or seven pints of rice, or eight pints of Cassava flour or farine, or eight pounds of biscuit, or twenty pounds of yams or potatoes, or sixteen pounds of eddoes, tanias or tyres, or thirty pounds of plantains or bananas, and also one pound and one quarter of herrings, shads, mackarel, or other salted provisions, or double the quantity of fresh fish, or other fresh provisions, all which said provisions to be of good and wholesome quality; provided nevertheless, that every such owner or director shall have the absolute and uncontrollable right of distributing and dividing all and every such quantities of provision so to be divided as aforesaid, unto and among all and every his slave or slaves, in such proportions, shares and allowances as lie shall think proper, according to the different labour, size, age and strength, or otherwise, of all and every such slave and slaves, and as the same shall appear to him in his discretion eligible or right; but notwithstanding such discretionary power such owner or director shall actually distribute ,weekly and every week, among all his slaves the whole quantity of provisions herein before directed to be purchased or provided, under the penalty aforesaid for every omission; provided also, that every aged, infirm or sickly slave, and every slave afflicted with any loathsome or contagious disorder, or every slave being incapable of labour, shall receive weekly and every week at least one full rate or rates of allowance aforesaid, notwithstanding the general and discretionary power of dividing the same herein before permitted to the owner, and notwithstanding any other power which lie may have: And if any owner or director of any slave or slaves within the Leeward Islands shall omit or neglect, under any pretext whatever, especially under pretext of absence from the said plantation, or that the said slave is wandering about the towns, or other parts of the Island, or that he cannot, bo found, to distribute and share weekly and every week to any of his aged, inlirm or sickly slaves, or to any of his slaves afflicted with any loathsome or contagious disorder, or incapable of labour, such full rate or rates of provisions as aforesaid, he shall forfeit for every such neglect or omission the sum of twenty shillings, unless such slave shall be provided for in the hospital or sick-house.

2d. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful for every owner or director of any slaves employed on any plantation in the Leeward Islands, to reduce and diminish, when he shall be actually making sugar, or cutting canes on such plantation, for the whole week in which he makes such, reduction, the. quantity of provisions hereinbefore directed to be distributed among his slaves in the proportion which one filth part of the said provisions bears to the whole thereof, but on no account in a larger proportion; provided nevertheless, that inasmuch as it is necessary for ensuring the subsistence, which is the principal object of this Act, that in some of the Leeward Charribbee Islands, the provisions given to the slaves in crop-time should be increased, and may

without-derogating'from such subsistence be out of crop, diminished, that no owner or director of any slave within the Virgin Islands shall be permitted to make the aforesaid reduction, in any week in which he shall be or have been actually employed in the manufacturing sugar, or grinding canes ; but every owner or df-rector of every slave worked on any plantation within the said Virgin Islands, shall be permitted out of crop to make a reduction of one fifth part of the dry provisions hereinbefore directed to be given to his or her slaves, whenever he or she shall giye and allow to each and every of his or her slaves as much land and time as shall, with his or their labour on such land, for such time, be likely to produce the value of such dry provisions; and provided also, that if the value*of such dry provisions shall not be produced by such land, every such owner or director shall make good to every slave whose land shall be less productive, the difference between its produce and the value of the dry provisions to which such slave under this act would otherwise be entitled.

3d. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That money shall on no account be given to slaves in lieu of the provisions hereinbefore directed to be purchased or distributed, unless in case of absolute and unequivocal necessity ; and that if any owner or director of any, slave or slaves within the leeward islands shall offend against this clause he shall forfeit the sum of fifty pounds.

4th. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That whenever, or as often as any owner or director of any slave or slaves within the Leeward Islands shall commute or exchange for money, the provisions hereinbefore directed to he purchased or provided for such slaves, or any part of the same, ho shall give and pay to and among his slaves at the rate of four shillings per week for each and every slave with whom he shall make such commutation, and also give and allow two half days in each week to such slave, to resort to the best market for laying out to the best advantage such commutation-money; provided nevertheless, that It shall and may be lawful for every owner or director, to divide distribute and share such commutation money among all and every of his slaves with whom he makes such commutation, and exchange in the same manner, and with the same discretionary power as is hereinbefore vested in him with respect to the provisions he is hereinbefore directed to purchase, procure and distribute,

5th. And whereas from the situation and local circumstance of many estates in the Leeward Islands, the owners or directors of such estates arc enabled to allot portions of land to their slaves, more than sufficient for their support and maintenance, and from which such slaves grow rich, and it would therefore not only be unnecessary, but even unjust and ruinous to such planters, to compel them to give the same allowance with others who have not the benefit of such provision-grounds; be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That whenever the quantity of provision-land under cultivation with the owners time upon any estate in the Leeward Islands, shall he in the proportion of one acre of land for every ten slaves worked and employed upon such estate, and the produce of such land shall he in proportion to one half of the quantity of provisions, or in any larger proportion, by this Act directed to be purchased or procured for all the slaves so worked or employed, that then it shall and may be lawful for the owner or director of such plantation to diminish by one half, or in any other proportion, the quantity of dry provisions according to the quantity of provisions produced from such land, directed by this Act to be purchased or procured for and distributed among such slaves; provided the whole produce of the land so under cultivation, or the proportion hereby prescribed, is appropriated to the use of the slaves so employed; and provided also, that the owner or director distributes or causes to be distributed among them their full allowance or rates of salt or fresh provisions aforesaid; and provided further, that such owner or director shall attend the board of council in the Island, where, such plantation shall he situate once in every twelve months, and then and there take the following oath, “videlicet.”

“ I do swear, that there are now slaves upon or

“ belonging to the plantation under my direction, in the parish or division “of , and that there is, under the cultivation of provisions

WHEREAS there arc many slaves wandering through the country under prcamt,ic. various pretences, many of whom claim to be free, and others to be in the execution of their duty, and from the want of an account of runaway negroes published by authority, it is absolutely impossible to detect the imposition, and to distinguish between those on their duty or those deserted; therefore, to facilitate the apprehension of such evil-disposed persons, We, Your Majesty’s most dutiful ancl loyal subjects, Henry William Bentinck, esquire, captain general and governor in chief in and over the Islands of Saint Vincent, Bequia, and such other the Islands, commonly called The Grenadines, as lie to the northward of Cariacou in America, and the council and assembly of the same, have enacted, and be it and it is hereby enacted CJ . by the authority aforesaid, That every proprietor, possessor, renter, manager or ^cumis to be made overseer of slaves, shall, on the twentieth day of August, the twentieth day of of runaways.

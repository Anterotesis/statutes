[Preamble.]

WHEREAS it has been found that several persons have from various causes, unintentionally failed in giving in their general return of slaves within the period required by the Registry Act, and have since presented them for registration, but which returns the treasurer is not authorized to receive, whereby such persons have become liable to the heavy fines and penalties imposed by the aforesaid Act, and without such returns, the general Registry of Slaves in this Island could not be made complete; for the remedy of such persons,and for obtaining a more complete primary general return, —

Clause 1st. Be it and it is hereby enacted and ordained by the Governor, the Council and Assembly of this Your Majesty's Island of Dominica, that from and after the publication of this Act, the treasurer is hereby authorized and required to receive alt returns made to him in manner and form required by the Registry Act, until the first day of October, next ensuing and no longer; and all such persons as may hereafter tender their return of slaves, on or before the first day of October as aforesaid, shall be and they are hereby fully indemnified, acquitted, and set free from all fines, pains, and penalties by them individually incurred by the Registry Act, and from all suits in respect thereof; and the Treasurer is hereby authorized and required to record all such returns as if they had been made in the time prescribed by the

36 4. FURTHER PAPERS RELATING TO THE [Acts of

Registry Act: Provided always, that nothing hereinafter contained shall exempt or exonerate from all and every fine or fines imposed by the said Registry Act on every person or persons who may neglect or refuse delivering in their return of slaves for registration, after the said first day of October next ensuing.

And whereas it has been found impossible to procure in these Islands blank books of sufficient size and substantial binding, wherein to record in a clear, distinct, and permanent manner, the general Registry of Slaves, and that the treasurer will be compelled to send to England for books for that purpose, whereby the time may expire at which such record is directed to be completed before they can be procured; —

Clause 2d. Be it and it is hereby further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the further term of four months shall be and is hereby granted to the treasurer to complete such record, free and exempt from all fines and penalties imposed on him by the said Registry Act, provided he shall complete such record within the further extended time.

An ACT to establish Courts of Petty Sessions at stated times, for the Trial by Jury of Runaway or other Slaves in custody of the Provost Marshal, for Crimes under any of the Laws of this Island now existing, or hereafter to exist, for regulating, and in some instances varying their Punishment, as established by Laws now in force; for the more speedy Trial of Slaves committed for Misdemeanors or Petty Offences, by Justices of the said Court without a Trial by Jury; and to enable the Justices of the Courts of King's Bench and Grand Sessions of the Peace, immediately on the termination of their Sessions, to hold Courts of Petty Sessions for the Trial or Gaol Delivery of Slaves then in Custody of the said Marshal, and for other purposes connected therewith.

[Preamble.]

WHEREAS the irregular and frequent non-attendance of justices of the peace summoned to hold courts of special sessions under the laws of the Island now in force, has frequently occasioned great delay in bringing slaves committed for crimes or other offences to speedy trial, and considerable loss and expense to their owners, by paying burthensome gaol fees, and the loss of their labour: Therefore, and for remedy whereof, We, Your Majesty's loyal and obedient subjects the Governor in chief of this Your Majesty's Island of Dominica, the Council and Assembly of the same, do most humbly pray Your most Excellent Majesty that it may be enacted and ordained, —

Clause 1. And be it and it is enacted and ordained by the authority of the same, That a court of petty sessions hereby established, shall be holden the first Wednesday of April, June, October and December in every year, at the court-house in the town of Roseau, at the hour of ten o’clock in the forenoon of each day, and of any succeeding day by adjournment, not exceeding three days; which court shall consist of five justices of the peace, and not more, at each sitting, whereof, three if present, shall form a quorum, or number competent to hold a court and transact the business thereof; and the said court of petty sessions is hereby declared to be a court of record in the said Island to all intents and purposes, and shall meet and sit

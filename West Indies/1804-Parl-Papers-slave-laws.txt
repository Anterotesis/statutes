Spanish Town, 12th December 1797.

My Lord,

E beg leave to thank your Lordship for the confidential communication, to us, of his Grace the Duke of Portland’s Letter of the 12th of September, and for your anxious desire to accord the expectations expressed by that Minister with the sentiments and interests of the People of this Island.

We afiurc your Lordship that we entertain unlhaken loyalty to the King’s Person and Government, and a rnofl affectionate attachment to Great Britain j both founded in principle j and wc trull we may appeal to your Lordship’s justice, whether we have not on all occasions given ffcady support to your Administration, in the course of which circumffnnces occurred that rendered it necessary to raise enormous taxes on the people; which mult have been (till heavier, had not your Lordship’s activity and exertions for the fafecy and protection of this Country been so happily distinguished.

We are fully convinced of the critical and dangerous situation in which Grc.it Britain and her Colonies are placed from the Enemy we have to contend with, formidable by its power, but still more by unremitting attempts again!! all order, good government, and virtue, eminently detlruCtive to Countries circum (lanced as this is. We are most anxious to join our efforts in common with chose of our fellow Citizens to the exertions of the Mother Country, to repel a Foe from whom we have so much to apprehend., While we make this folcnm declaration of our sentiments to your Lordship, permit us to express how much the Inhabitants of the I (land at large fed themselves injured and oppressed by the supporr, given by some of His Majesty’s confidential iervants to measures calculated in the firfb ihftance not-only to check but effectually to destroy improvements which arc now rapidly carrying on in all parts of this valuable Colony, promising the greateff advantages to the {lability of the Island by increasing its population, and affording tiiofe means from which alone revenue qm flow, in a degree far beyond all former experience.

So much has already been urged on the subject of an Abolition of the Slave* Trade, that we shall at present only express 'our surprise that the promoters of that measure should not be impressed with an idea that Negroes must have a much better chance of being made comfortable and happy under Christian Masters, pdlefied of liberal principles, whose authority is limited by law, than Slaves in Africa under savage tyrants poflefiing the power of life and death over their dependants.

As individuals affectionately attached to the Parent State, we have laid before your Lordship pur sentiments on objects which, in our opinion, deserve the serious consideration of His Majesty’s Mihiflers, as connected with the prosperity of the Empire at large, and most especially incerefting to this Colony.

That whatever our enemies in Great Britain may presume.to afiert to;the contrary, . it is certain that the Legislature of Jamaica has done every thing possible to be done, tc render the condition of the Slaves therein as favourable as is confident with their reasonable services, and the.safety of the white Inhabitants. To provethis they refer to their Statutes on that subject.; and within -those ten years, it is particularly tb be remarked, that ir’has been the coriftanr. endeavour of the Planters of this Island, unitedly as well'as individually,-to promote-and secure the-comforts of their Slaves: Thac the fame conduct will be continued there is every reason to expect, more especially as the most essential interests of Proprietors are so strongly connected with the welfare and prosperity of their Labourers. The Legislature of the Island is alone competent to determine on such future measures. as may be expedient further to contribute to this very salutary object, founded on principles of humanity and justice, as well as good policy. There can be no doubt, that the (late and condition of rhe Slaves have of late been greatly meliorated, and from the attention and care of the Legislature in enabling such further regulations as may be necessary, in aid of the humane dispo-fitions of the Inhabitants, that the condition of their Labourers will be further greatly improved, and population by Negroes born and reared in the Country encreased: but measures best calculated to forward these two important objects mult be adopted gradually, in order to facilitate and effect the purposes intended. In pursuing this find of conduct, the Legislature, as well as the Inhabitants, will do all that can be reasonably expected by the British Parliament, and which certainly ought to protect them against the vi'olations of Rights, which a sacred regard to national justice and good faith ought to secure co them inviolably. The being iupplied with Labourers from Africa for supporting, improving, and extending Settlements already made, and also for making new fctrlements in lands within the Island, the property of individuals, is a right most sacredly pledged to us; and any attempt to take away or reftridb that right, so as to abridge the supply necessary not only to maintain the present (lock and the present cultivation, but also to enable the Proprietors of lands granted by the Crown for the express purpose of being settled, mult unavoidably defeat the lawful intentions of the Inhabitants by their labour and exertions to improve their own fortunes, and thereby efientially co contribute to the' riches and prosperity of the Empire at large.

That this House is therefore called upon, in a peculiar manner, at this momentous crisis, by the duty they owe to thernselves and their condiments, to reforc to every constitutionai measure to refill the evils with which they are threatened.

That the Committee, upon considering the state of the culture of this Island, have endeavoured to shew how much its security against internal or external danger will be rendered more este<5tual and permanent from the settling numerous plantations in the interior.

That should the Country be deprived of the right to procure Slaves from the 119. Coast

COUNCIL.

23d March 1800.

THE Committee of the Council* to whom your Honour referred certain queries and suggestions, transmitted % his Grace the Duke of -Portland, dated Whitehall, April 21ft 1798, relative to the increase of Negroes in this Island, and the improvement of their state, have taken the fan^e into their confederation, and are of opinion:

. That the Legislature of this Island have for many years past uniformly manifested the moll sincere and earnest intentions to improve the condition of the Slaves, to the utmost degree that their estate is capable of, and that is consistent with the safety and welfare of the W hite Inhabitants. With this view was passed the consolidateu Slave Act in the year 1791, wherein many essential concdflo^ and provisions are madein their favour, and for their benefit, far beyond what the policy of former laws had deemed expedient, which will clearly appear from a reference to the said Act, and a comparison thereof with the earlier Acts of this Island, regulating the management of the Slaves.

From this dispofuion so' well evidenced, the Committee entertain the fulled: confidence, that if the Legislature in their wisdom, may hereafter perceive it possible still to improve their condition, that they will cheerfully adopt all measures for that. purpose that can be reconciled to the principles of safety and found policy.

"With regard to the causes which are supposed to have retarded the increase of Slaves, the Committee are inclined to think they are to- be found principally in the ignorance. of, and want of skill in the midwives, and to the prejudices and immorality of the Negro mothers in common. But as much more particular care and attention are paid of late years, by the several Proprietors to the Negro women in childbed, than was the custorn formerly, they think the evil may reasonably be expected to be growing less.

In answer to the second Query, the Committee find by an official return madeto the Council by the Naval Officer of this Island, that there have been one hundred

Hie hist ten years, and that twenty-five thdufand four HlihdKed and thirty :tiiVCe Sidve£ have been re-exported during that period; and it apjjedVs alFo td life Chnirtiktee, from thb fe turns which have been already rhade by the Clerks ‘of the Peate, that for fourteen parishes, the number transported off the Aland under juditial Sentences, during the lait ten years, is, taking them collectively, one liUtidred dricl fcighty-Btte, and the number executed for crimes taken in the same manner, and for the same term, is iiinetydlx. But as to the number bf fhdfe pirtlted or kidnapped, your Corriiinidee have not beeri able to obtain any infohmddbri, But they have reaibn tb think fclib number rtiiift be very inconfidelable.

With respect to the number executed and trahfpofted, the Committee thifik it proper to obfciwe, that of tiiofe Before mentioned, levehty-five Were exefcut&d, artd sixty one transported, for being parties concerned iti the lath rebellion of the Trb-kwney MdroOris.

The Committee is not possessed of documents, hor are they attainable by them’, whereby to ascertain what has been bn a compaiiibn of births and deaths, thd anttual difference between them; nor can they ascertain what proportion off the numbers imported has been wanted for the supply of the effaces actually settled, and what for the annual increase of cultivation.

In regard to the third Query and suggestion, the Committee cannot advance any opinion as to what might be the fentinients of the Legislature of this Island, the Assembly not being fitting ; but they are fully impressed with a conviction that they will be ever ready to promote any measure in their power which may be conducive to the improvement of the Slaves, and of their condition, as they have already intimated in their answer to the first query.

The Committee however cannot avoid observing, that they believe it to be a general, if not universal custom, to exempt pregnant women from field or any other hard labour, during a period of more than six weeks, or even two months of their pregnancy ; and from all labour except the care of their children, for the lame time after their delivery. At the time of their delivery, and during the consequent confinement, not only the mother, but the new-born child as well as all other young children flie may have, receive the aid and assistance of the Proprietors, or those acting for them.

In respect to the fourth and fifth Suggestions, the Committee observe, that they are prevented from advancing any opinion on the important subjects therein contained, for the same reasons which retrained them in the case of the third suggestions, as they arc matters rcferrable to the Legislature at large. But the Committee cannot help observing, as to the appointments of inspeCtors or Visitors to superintend and enforce all regulations enacted in favour of the Negroes, instead of the present Courts of protection, that such measure is not expedient, and may be productive of great confusion and inconvenience.

On the sixth Query, the Committee have to state, that by a law of this Island, passed in the year of our Lordi 1797, intituled, “An Act for the better establish-" meat of the Clergy of this Island, to oblige the Justices and Vestries to build a “ Church and a Parsonage-house in their respective parishes and for establishing a “ fund or provision for the support and maintenance of the Widows and Orphan “ children of deceased Clergymen.” An addition is made to the stipend of all the beneficed Clergy in this 1 {land, who are by the said Jaw directed and required to alloc a portion of time, either before or after the performance of divine service, every Sunday in c’neir respective Churches to chriffen such Negroes or other Slaves as {hail desire it, as well as to instruCt all Slaves who {hall attend for that purpose, in the precepts of the Christian Religion.

This law evinces the deflrc of the Legislature effectually to establish the Chriffian. Religion amongst the Negroes, and by impressing their minds with its principles and

7O precepts.

Jamaica, precepts, essentially to improve all their habits and manners, thereby removing and wearing out their barbarous and heathenifli persuasions, many of which tend to the prejudice of natural population, and are alike pernicious* to themselves and their Owners. This is an event interesting and doubclefs greatly to be wished for, but which cannot probably be otherwise well produced than by flow degrees, and without any striking appearances of innovation.

In answer to the seventh Query and suggestions, your Committee beg leave to observe, that the lame difficulty which occurred in advancing any opinion as to what might be the fentimencs of the Legislature on the subject matter of the third, fourth, and fifth queries, applies in a more peculiar manner to the prefenr, from the novelty and importance of the matter therein contained; the Committee however, have no hesitation in expressing it as their opinion, that the measure of attaching plantation Negroes to the foil, in the nature of adferipti gleba, would tend essentially to their happiness and welfare j but with respect to the remedy by sequestration, they entertain great doubts how far such a measure would from the nature of West India property, be beneficial to the Debtor and Creditor.

St. CHRISTOPHER.

An Act more effectually to provide for the Support, and to extend certain Regulations for the Protection of Slaves; to promote and encourage their Increase, and generally to meliorate their Condition.

YOUR Majesty’s loyal and obedient subjects, the Commander in Chief of Your Majesty’s Leeward Charibbee Islands in America, and the General Council and General Assembly of the said Islands, duly convened and assembled at the town of .-Bafletcrrc, in the island of Sc. Christopher, having taken into their most serious consideration the Resolution of the Honourable the House of Commons of Great Britain, of the 6th day of April, in the 37th year of Your Majesty’s reign, recommended to their attention by Your Majesty’s said Commander in Chief of your Leeward Charibbee Islands, in obedience to Your Majesty’s orders, communicated by his Grace the Duke of Portland, one of Your Majesty’s principal Secretaries of State, and having maturely deliberated upon the measures which appear to them best calculated to obviate the causes which hitherto may have -impeded the natural increase of Negroes already in these Islands, gradually, as they hope, to diminish the necessity of the Slave Trade, and ultimately to lead to its final termination, and desiring to grant unto the Slaves in these Your Majesty’sLeeward'- Charibbee Islands every indulgence and encouragement which may tend to their moral and religious improvement, and to secure -to them the certain, immediate, and active protection of the law, as far as the fame-can possibly be extended to.them, consistently with that good order, discipline, and obedience, which it is absolutely necessary to preserve and maintain in all places, where., from inevitable local circumstances, Slavery m'uft, with some restrictions, be tolerated.? and desiring also to prevent; as much as pofli-Ble, any instances of cruelty or oppression, and to compel all persons to treat their Slaves with that humanity which is generally prevalent in these Islands? Do humbly pray Your Most Excellent Majesty that it may be enadfccd and ordained

ill. And be it, and it is hereby enacted and ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That, every Owner or Director of any Slave or Slaves within the Leeward Islands, shall weekly and every week, under the penalty of ten shillings per head for each and every Slave under his or her direction, for every omission, purchase or provide, at the rate of ;the following quantities of provisions? diac is to say, for every Slave at the rate of nine pints of corn or beans, or eight pints of peale or wheat,

or rye flour, or Indian corn meal, or nine pints of oatmeal, of seven pints of rice, or eight pints cf cafiava -flour or farina, or eight pounds of biscuit, or twenty pounds of yams or potatoes, or sixteen pounds of eddoes, fanias or tyres, or thirty pounds of plantains or bananas, and also one pound and one quarter of herrings, fhads, mackarel, or other salted provisions, or double the quantity of fresh fish or other fresh provisions? all which laid provisions to be of good and whole-some quality : Provided nevertheless, that every such Owner or Director shall have the absolute and uncontroqlable right of distributing and dividing all and every such quantities of provisions so to be provided as aforesaid, unto and among all and every his Slave or Slaves, in such proportions, shares, and allowances, as he shall think proper, according to the different labour, size, age, and strength, or otherwise, of all and every such Slave and Slaves, and as the fame shall appear to him in his discretion eligible or right ? but notwithstanding such discretionary power, such Owner or Director shall actually distribute weekly and every week among ail his Slaves, the whole quantity of provisions hereinbefore directed to be purchased or provided, under the penalty aforesaid for every omission.: Provided also, that every aged, sickly, or infirm Slave, and every Slave afilidted with any loath some or contagious disorder, or every Slave being incapable of labour, shall receive weekly and every week, at.least one full rate or ratio of allowance aforesaid, notwithstanding the general and diferetionary power of dividing the fame, hereinbefore permitted to

the Owner, and notwithstanding any other power which he may have; and if any Owner or Director of any Slave or Slaves within the Leeward Islands, shall omit or neglect, under any pretext whatever, especially under pretext of absence from the said plantation, or that the said Slave is wandering about the towns or other parts of the Island, or that he cannot be found, to distribute and share weekly and every week to any of his aged, infirm, or sickly Slaves, or to any of his Slaves affli&cd with any loathlbmc or contagious disorder, or incapable of labour, such full rate or ratio of provisions as aforesaid, he shall forfeit for every such neglefb or omission the sum of twenty shillings, unless such Slave (lull be provided for in the Hospital or Sick House.

5th. t\ ntl whereas, from the situation and local circumstances of many estates in the Leeward I fl uids, the Owners or Directors of such estates are enabled to allot portions of land to their Slaves more than fufit ient for their support and maintenance, and Irom wh ch !uch Slaves grow rich; and it would therefore nor only be unneccfLry, bm ev~n unjust and ruinous, to ftrh Planters, to compel them lo give the fame allowance with other- who have not the benefitjof such provision grounds; Be

BARBADOES ISLAND ACT.

A Copy of an ACT for more fully ascertaining the Slave Population of the Island of Barbadoes.

WHEREAS it has been thought probable in the mother country that the re-establishment of peace may afford facilities to an illicit introduction of slaves into the British settlements in the West Indies: And whereas the legislature of this Island, notwithstanding it feels the most thorough conviction that no such importation into this Island ever has been or is likely to be attempted, is yet desirous to co-operate in any measures which may be deemed necessary for giving the fullest effect to the Acts for the abolition of the slave trade: And whereas many advantages may be derived to the inhabitants of this Island from a more exact specification and return of the slave population; Be it therefore Enacted by the Honourable John Spooler, President of His Majesty’s Council, and Commander in Chief of this Island, Chancellor, Ordinary, and Vice Admiral of the same, the Honourable the Members of His Majesty’s Council, and the General Assembly of this Island, and by the authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful for the said President or Commander in Chief of this Island for the time being, and he is hereby authorized and required to appoint by commission under his sign manual, some fit and proper person, resident within this Island, to be registrar of slaves therein, and that such registrar shall be personally resident within this colony while he shall continue to hold the said office, except when from ill health or other necessary cause his temporary absence from this Island shall be permitted by the governor or commander in chief of this Island for the time being, by and with the consent of His Majesty’s Council; provided nevertheless, that such temporary absence shall not exceed the period of twelve months; and if the said registrar shall be at any time absent from this Island, without such license or permission as aforesaid, he shall absolutely forfeit his office; and in case of the death, absence, or incapacity of the said registrar, or any avoidance of the said office, a new registrar shall be in like manner appointed by the governor or commander in chief of this Island for the time being, by commission under his sign manual.

2d. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That between the first day of March and the first day of June now next ensuing, and in every third following year, every person who shall be then resident in this Island, and who shall be in possession of any slave or slaves within the same, whether as proprietor, mortgagee, trustee, sequestrator or receiver, lessee, manager or attorney of or for such slaves, shall respectively make and deliver upon oath to the registrar so to be appointed as aforesaid, such schedules, lists and particulars in writing, as are hereinafter mentioned; that is to say, every person in possession of any slaves as aforesaid, shall so make and return a schedule or list in writing, therein specifying in the first place his or her own name and description, and the name and description of such other person or persons, being the owner or owners of such slave or slaves on whose behalf the return is made, and the right or character in which the party making such return holds possession of and claims title to such slave or slaves, namely, whether as proprietor, mortgagee, trustee, sequestrator or receiver, lessee, manager, or attorney, executor, administrator, guardian or otherwise; and after such description as aforesaid, shall proceed to name, describe and enumerate distinctly, the several negroes, mulatto or other slaves belonging to the same owner or owners, in manner following; that is to say, the schedule or paper containing the said list shall be divided into six perpendicular columns of convenient breadth, respectively entitled at the heads thereof, name, sex, colour, employment, age and country; and in the first of the said columns shall be inserted the name of each slave by which he or she has been usually called or known; in the second of the said columns shall he inserted the sex of which such slave is; the third of the said columns shall be inserted black or coloured (including under the term “Coloured”

3d. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in all lists and schedules to be made and returned as aforesaid, after the first general return required by this Act, there shall be in every succeeding return contained, a true and particular account of all births and deaths of slaves belonging to the person or persons on whose behalf such return is made, within the three years next preceding since the last returns were made; and also an account of all deductions from or additions to the former list of slaves belonging to such person or persons, within the same period, whether the same shall have happened by desertion, sale, or other transfer of property, enfranchisement, or by return of fugitive slaves, or by purchase, succession, reversion, or other lawful acquisition within this Island, or by any lawful importation: which particular cause or mode of deduction or addition shall in all eases be distinctly specified in such return, so that the general increase and decrease of slaves, their conditions and numbers, may be fully known and considered.

“So help you GOD.”

And all and every such owner and owners, person and persons, who are of the denomination of the people called quakers, is and are hereby required in like manner to give in the same upon his her or their solemn affirmation; provided nevertheless, that in case any owner of slaves resident in this Island shall, from sickness or any bodily infirmity, be prevented from attending the said registrar, to deliver such list or schedule of his or her slaves as hereinbefore is directed, it shall and may be lawful for any other person in behalf of such owner, to give in such his or her list or schedule in the form hereinbefore prescribed; such person so giving in for another at the time of delivering such list or schedule, taking the following oath before the said registrar, who is hereby empowered and required, under the penalty aforesaid, to administer the same;

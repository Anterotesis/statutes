19 December 1688.]—An Act for the better regulating of Outcries in ‘ Open Market.

Whereas great inconveniences have daily happened to debtors that have their cattle, coppers and stills, and other chattels brought by execution to open market to be outcried, whereat the Marshals have set the said cattle, coppers and stills, and other goods in great lots or numbers to be sold, so that only ready monied and rich men are able to buy them; whereby for want of bidders, the said cattle and coppers, stills and other goods, are often bought at under rates and value: Wherefore, for prevention of the said inconveniences for the future, Be it enacted by the Right Honourable Edwin Stede, His Majesty's Lieutenant-Governor and Commander-in-Chief of this and other the Caribbee Islands, the Honourable the Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by authority of the same, That the Marshal or other deputed officer of every Court in this Island, upon attachment of any cattle, coppers, stills or other chattels, by virtue of any execution for above One Hundred Pounds sterling, or the value thereof, that shall be after publication of this Act taken out, shall set up, four days at the furthest after attachment as aforesaid, notice in writing upon the court-door of this Island, of the cattle, coppers, stills and other goods so attached as aforesaid , and the place and time, when and where they are to be sold; which sale shall be at some time between ten and fourteen days after attachment as aforesaid, to the end persons intending to buy, may have timely notice thereof. And when the cattle, coppers, stills, or other chattels aforesaid, to be attached as aforesaid, shall be brought to market, the debtor or his assigns shall have free liberty to dispose the goods so attached into lots as he shall think most convenient for his interest. But if the debtor shall neglect or refuse so to do, the Marshal is hereby required to dispose the chattels aforesaid into lots. And also the Marshal is hereby required not to sell above five bead of cattle, one copper, or one still in one lot, unless otherwise appointed by the debtor. And all other chattels, the Marshal shall to the best of his judgment, estimate and dispose of into lots, not exceeding the value of Fifty Pounds sterling, in each lot, unless therein also otherwise directed by the debtor.

And it 13 further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That no outcries of sales aforesaid shall be had or made at plantations, or in any other places, but in open market only; except timber, sugar-pots, drips and other ponderous and heavy goods, too troublesome to be removed out of the plantation to open market.

And whereas the fees of the respective Marshals of the said Courrs for levying executions, have been hitherto variously construed, to the great injury of many the inhabitants of this Island, sometimes computing the said fee in sugar, but most commonly in money, which proves very inconvenient: For remedy of which various construction for the future, Be it declared and enacted by authority aforesaid, That the Marshal levying an execution, shall for the future, computing and taking his fee aforesaid, commute the moneys, if the execution be in money, into sugar, at Twelve Shillings and Sixpence per hundred, and shall charge four per cent, for the first thousand pounds of sugar, ihree for the second, and two per cent, for all above; which fee being thus computed, the Marshal shall receive in money at Twelve Shillings and Sixpence per hundred, and no more.

And to the end the officers of the several Courts of this Island may not extort more for their respective fees than is established for them, and that the inhabitants may the better know what fees are appointed to be paid, Be it enacted and ordained by the authority aforesaid, That every of the said respective officers in this Island, shall set up in their respective offices, a fair table of the fees that by the laws of this Island are allowed them. And whatsoever officer shall presume to extort more than by the laws aforesaid are allowed, shall forfeit Fifty Pounds sterling, one half to his Majesty for the use and defence of this Island, and the other half to the informer that shall sue for the same; and for ever after conviction thereof, be hereby deemed uncapable to execute that office.

Clergy of this Island.

[Clauses 2 to 13, 15, and 16 repealed.]

[Preamble.]

Whereas, the stipends allowed by law to the beneficed clergy of this Island

are considered inadequate to the increased labours which they have for some time past so cheerfully and zealously performed, and will continue to perform, in the religious instruction of the population: And whereas these pious pastors, from a benevolent and highly praiseworthy feeling, are not in the habit of exacting the fees to which they are legally entitled from any of their parishioners, but such as can’ well afford to pay them: And whereas it is deemed essential to the interests of true religion and the well being of the Established Church, that every encouragement should be given to the continuance of such their spirit of liberality and Christian virtue, and that such a sufficient and honourable maintenance should be secured to them by law as to prevent the necessity of any sums of money being voted to them by their vestries from the parish ftinds in aid of their means of support as hath hitherto been customary, thereby subjecting them to the appearance of a degrading dependence.

1. Be it therefore enacted, by the Honourable John Brathwaite Skeete, President of his Majesty's Council and Commander-in-Chief of this Island, Chancellor, Ordinary, and Vice-Admiral of the same, the Honourable the Members of his Majesty's Council, and the General Assembly of this Island, ttSrsti fixed.8 at anc* ^y the authority of the same, That from and after the Twenty-fifth day of

And the Treasurer of this Island shall pay, and he is hereby autho-rised and directed to pay the same accordingly without any further or other order for that purpose.

be supported by positive and creditable evidence of the fact or by such evidence as, if not explained or contradicted, shall, in the opinion of the Justice or Justices, raise a strong presumption of the guilt of the person charged, such person shall be committed to prison by such Justice or Justices in the manner hereinafter mentioned. But if there shall be only one Justice present, and the whole evidence given before him shall be such as neither to raise a strong presumption of guilt nor to warrant the dismissal of the charge, such Justice shall order the person charged to be detained in custody, until he or she shall be taken before two Justices at the least; and where any person so taken, or any person in the first instance taken before two Justices of the Peace, shall be charged with felony, or on suspicion of felony, and the evidence given in support of the charge, shall, in their opinion, not be such as to raise a strong presumption of the guilt of the person charged, and to require his or her committal, or such evidence shall be adduced on behalf of the person cltarged, as shall, in their opinion, weaken the presumption of his or her guilt, but there shall, notwithstanding, appear to them, in either of such cases, to be sufficient grounds for judicial inquiry into his or her guilt, the person charged shall be admitted to bail by such two Justices, in the manner hereinafter mentioned: Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to require any such Justice or Justices to hear evidence on behalf of any person so charged as aforesaid, unless it shall appear to him, or them, to be meet and conducive to the ends of justice to hear the same.

And the two Justices shall certify such bailment in writing.

27 February 1846.]—An Act to remove doubts as to whether certain provisions of an Act of this Island, entitled "An Act declaring what Proofs to Bonds, Bills, Procurations, Letters of Attorney, or other Writings, shall be sufficient," are repealed by the Statute of the Imperial Parliament passed in the fifth and sixth years of the Reign of his late Majesty King William the Fourth, entitled "An Act to Repeal an Act of the present Session of Parliament, entitled An Act for the more effectual abolition of Oaths and Affirmations, taken and made in various Departments of the State, and to substitute Declarations in lieu thereof, and for the more entire suppression of Voluntary and Extra-Judicial Oaths and Affidavits; and to make other provisions for the abolition of unnecessary Oaths.’ "

[Preamble.]

Whereas, by an Act of this Island which passed on the Sixteenth day of September, One thousand six hundred and fifty-three, entitled "An Act " declaring what Proofs to Bonds, Bills, Procurations, Letters of Attorney, or " other Writings shall be sufficient," reciting that by reason of the great distance between this place and England, direct proof concerning deeds, bonds, writings, or other specialties for moneys or goods taken up or engaged, for and towards the supply and further settlement of this Island, and of letters of attorney, procurations, or other writings to prove the same cannot be had; and also any bonds or specialties thereafter to be taken upon any consideration whatsoever, whereby great mischiefs had redounded to the good people of the Commonwealth of England, and great obstructions to the justice of this Island, no express provision being made therein. For remedy whereof it was enacted and ordained by the Governor, Council, and Assembly, and by the authority of the same, That such deeds and bonds and other specialties, all letters of attorney, procurations or other powers in writings, which should at any time after the publication thereof, be produced in any Court of Justice within this Island, attested to have been proved on oath, under the corporation seal of the Lord Mayor of London, or any other mayor or chief officer of any city or town corporate, within the dominions of the Commonwealth of England should be taken, deemed, and adjudged as sufficient in law as if the witnesses in them named and subscribed had been personally here, and proved the same, which Act has not been repealed, or in anyway altered by any enactment of the Legislature of this Colony: And whereas since the passing of the said Statute of the Imperial Parliament entitled "An Act to " repeal an Act of the present Session of Parliament, entitled An Act for " the more effectual abolition of Oaths and Affirmations taken and made in " various Departments of the State, and to substitute Declarations in lieu <( thereof, and for the more entire suppression of Voluntary and Extra-Judicial " Oaths and Affidavits, and to make other provisions for the abolition of " unnecessary Oaths,’ " it hath been the practice to admit on record in the Secretary’s office of this Island powers of attorney, deeds, procurations, and other instruments in writing, executed in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and verified and proved by a solemn declaration made according to the provisions of the said Statute, instead of requiring proof of such execution to be made by affidavit in the manner provided by the aforesaid in part recited Act of this Island: And whereas doubts are entertained whether the provisions of the aforesaid in part recited Act of this Island are repealed by the said Statute of the fifth and sixth of his said late Majesty

And it was further provided in and by the said Act that the said Commissioners should give notice, in the manner herein directed, when and where they would be ready to treat with the owners of the lands comprised in the said burnt district, included in such survey as aforesaid, for the purchase of their respective interests therein, and to require all persons residing in this Island to give in the particulars thereof within thirty days next after such notice; and all other persons, residing out of the Island, to give in such particulars within six months next after such notice: And it was further provided in and by the said Act, that from and after the expiration of six months from such notice, all and singular the lands comprised in the said burnt district and included in the said survey, in respect of which the particulars of the rights and interests of the persons interested therein should not have been given in to the said Commissioners pursuant to the said Act, and all and singular the houses, erections, walls, and ruins standing thereon, should be and become vested in her Majesty, her heirs and successors, for the public service, absolutely and for ever exonerated and discharged of all legal and equitable right and interest of all persons whomsoever, and in lieu thereof the parties interested were declared to be entitled to an equivalent in money, to be fixed and ascertained by a jury in the manner provided in the said Act: And whereas Commissioners were duly appointed pursuant to the directions of the said Act for carrying out the objects thereof:

And whereas the said Commissioners, on the Fifth day of October, One thousand eight hundred and forty-six, made a report of their proceedings to his ' Excellency the Right Honourable Sir Charles Edward Grey, then Governor and Commander-in-Chief of this Island, in which, amongst other things, they observed that in the original survey made by the said John Atwood and Tobias Phillips* it was stated that the partially burnt portion of the said city

Whereas in and by a certain Act of this Island, made and passed in the sixth year of the reign of her present Majesty Queen Victoria, entitled "An Act to authorize the removal of Prisoners from the Common Gaol to the " Houses of Correction," the Governor or Commander-in-Chief for the time being is empowered, when he shall see cause so to do, to issue an order for the removal of so many of the prisoners confined in the common gaol as shall have been convicted of felony, and sentenced to imprisonment, as he may deem proper, to any of the penitentiaries or houses of correction in the rural districts, at which keepers shall be employed: And whereas, it is being in contemplation of the Legislature of this Island to erect a new prison, and to reconstruct the buildings now used as a common gaol into a court house, and other apartments suitable for the assembling of the Legislature; and it being necessary, in order to facilitate such alterations, to remove a certain number of prisoners to such of the penitentiaries and houses of correction in the rural districts, at which keepers are employed, in the mean time, and until the said new prison shall be ready for their reception, it is therefore expedient to extend the provisions of the said recited Act, and to vest in the Governor the like authority over all prisoners now confined in the common gaol, other than such confined for debt:

Be it enacted by his Excellency William Reid, esquire, Lieutenant-Colonel in her Majesty's Royal Engineers, Companion of the most Honourable Order of the Bath, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of this Island, the Honourable the Members of her Majesty's Council, and the General Assembly of this Island, and by the authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful for the Governor or Commander-in-Chief for the time being, to issue an order or orders, from time to time, as he shall see fit, to the Inspector-General of Police, directing and authorizing him to remove to any of the penitentiaries or houses of correction in the rural districts, at which keepers are employed, such prisoners as shall be confined in the common gaol (other than persons confined for debt) whose names shall be specified in such order of removal. And each such order of removal shall of itself be a sufficient authority for the removal of the prisoners therein named, and for their detention in the penitentiaries or houses of correction to which they shall therein be directed to be sent, and be in all respects of the like effect and validity as if their original sentence or commitment had been confinement in such penitentiary or house of correction. And it shall be lawful for the Governor or Commander-in-Chief, in ordering such removals, to distribute the prisoners among such penitentiaries or houses of correction as aforesaid, in such manner as shall seem to him best calculated to effect a due classification of the same. And it shall be lawful for the Governor or Commander-in-Chief to exercise a like authority for the removal of such prisoners from any one of such penitentiaries or houses of correction to another, and for their detention therein, or to order their removal back to the common gaol, at any time he shall deem the same necessary and expedient.

2. And be it further enacted, That all such prisoners as shall be so removed as aforesaid to any penitentiary or house of correction, shall continue to be subject and liable to the same rules and regulations, for the maintenance of discipline and the carrying out of their sentences, while in such house or houses of correction, as they would have been subject and liable to if they

[Clause 1 repeals certain Acts.]

Whereas there are divers laws of this Island now in force concerning the Preamble, taking out of tickets by persons intending to depart from this Island : and whereas such laws are not only constantly evaded, by reason of the difficulties experienced in enforcing their provisions, but are opposed to the spirit and freedom of the British constitution, and it is expedient to repeal them and to abolish all such restrictions on the liberty of the subject:

2. And whereas by the fourth Clause of the herein-before mentioned Act, entitled "An Act concerning persons intending to depart this Island, and the Warrants of arrest for "setting up their names in the Secretary’s Office and Warrants of Arrest," 1(W. °r upirards certain regulations are made respecting the arrest of persons on mesne process, £""v°e to

and that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant or any one or more of the defendants is or are about to quit this Island, it shall be lawful for such Judge to issue his precept, directed to the Provost Marshal or his lawful deputy, to arrest and hold to bail such defendant or defendants so about to quit this Island, for such sum as such Judge shall think fit, not exceeding the amount of the debt or damage : Provided always, that if such person or persons having cause of action as aforesaid, shall not have filed his or their declaration in the said Court of Common Pleas, he or they shall notwithstanding be entitled to such precept of arrest on making such affidavit and on filing a declaration within three days after any person or persons shall have been arrested.

3. And be it enacted, That the Provost Marshal or other officer to whom any such precept shall be directed, shall forthwith proceed to arrest the defendant thereupon, and such defendant when so arrested shall remain in custody until he shall have given bail to the Provost Marshal according to the present practice of this Island, or shall have made deposit of the sum mentioned in such precept, together with five pounds for costs.

4. And be it enacted, That any such precept may be issued and the defendant arrested in pursuance thereof, at any time after the commencement of such action, and before execution shall issue on any final judgment obtained therein, and that a defendant in custody upon any such arrest and not previously served with a copy of the declaration, may be lawfully served therewith.

6. And whereas, by the law of this Island the Police Magistrates have jurisdiction in cases of debt, not exceeding ten pounds, late current money of this Island, subject however to appeal to other courts, and it is expedient and just to creditors that some security should be afforded them against the loss of their debts by the debtors leaving the Island, pending appeals from the decision of the Police Magistrates: Be it enacted, That when a decision shall have been given by any Police Magistrate in favour of a creditor, and execution stayed in consequence of appeal by the debtor, and the creditor, on or pending such appeal, shall make an affidavit before such Police Magistrate, that there is probable cause for believing that the debtor is about to quit the Island, it shall be lawful for such Police Magistrate to summon the debtor forthwith to appear before him, or, if necessary, to issue a warrant for his or her apprehension, and to require him or her to furnish security in a sum not exceeding the debt and costs, to prosecute his or her appeal, and to abide the decision of the superior Courts. And in case such debtor shall refuse, or be unable to find the necessary security, it shall be lawful for the Police Magistrate to grant execution to the creditor to be levied forthwith : Provided always, that where any goods or chattels of any such debtor shall have been levied on or taken under and by virtue of any execution issued under the circumstances aforesaid, such goods and chattels shall remain in possession of the constable or other person to whom the writ shall have been entrusted, and shall not be sold or disposed of until the appeal has been disposed of; and where for want of goods and chattels the person of the debtor shall have beeu taken under such execution, if the appeal be decided in his or her favour, he or she shall be forthwith liberated from arrest.

Whereas the technical strictness of criminal proceedings might in some instances be further relaxed so as to insure the punishment of the guilty without depriving the accused of any just means of defence: And whereas it is expedient to make further provision for the more effectual prosecution of accessories before and after the fact to felony: And whereas it is also expedient that any accessory before the fact to felony should be liable to be indicted, tried, convicted and punished in all respects like the principal, as is now the case in treason, and in all misdemeanors : Be it therefore enacted by his Excellency Sir William Macbean George Colebrooke, Knight, Colonel in her Majesty's Royal Regiment of Artillery, Companion of the most Honourable Order of the Bath, Governor and Commander-in-Chief, the Honourable the Members of her Majesty's Council, and the General Assembly of this Island, and by the authority of the same, That—

1. If after the passing of this Act, any person shall become an accessory before the fact to any felony, whether the same be a felony at common law or by virtue of any statute or statutes made or to be made, such person may be indicted, tried, convicted and punished in all respects as if he were a principal felon.

2. Whereas an accessory after the fact to felony can at present be tried only along with the principal felon, or after the principal felou has been convicted and not otherwise which is sometimes productive of a failure of justice:

If therefore from and after the passing of this Act, any person shall become an accessory after the fact to any felony whether the same be a felony at common law, or by virtue of any statute or statutes made or to be made, he may be indicted, and convicted either as an accessory ’ after the fact to the principal felony, together with the principal felon, or after conviction of the principal felon, or may be indicted and convicted of a substantive felony whether the principal felon shall or shall not have been previously convicted

3. Whereas according to the present practice of Courts of criminal jurisdiction it is not permitted in an indictment for stealing property to add a count for receiving the same property knowing it to have been stolen, or in an indictment for receiving stolen property knowing it to have been stolen, to add a count for stealing the same property, and justice is hereby often defeated; therefore from and after the passing of this Act, in every indictment for feloniously stealing property it shall be lawful to add a count for feloniously receiving the same property knowing it to have been stolen, and in any indictment for feloniously receiving property knowing it to have been stolen, it shall be lawful to add a count for feloniously stealing the same property. And where any such indictment shall have been preferred and found against any person, the prosecutor shall not be put to his election, but it shall be lawful for the jury who shall try the same to find a verdict of guilty, either for stealing the property or of receiving it knowing it to have been stolen, and if such indictments shall have been preferred and found against two or more persons, it shall be lawful for the said jury who shall try the same, to find all or any of the said persons guilty either for stealing the property or of receiving it knowing it have been stolen, or to find one or more of the said persons guilty of stealing the property, and the other or others of them guilty of receiving it knowing it to have been stolen.

4. Whereas a failure of justice frequently takes place in criminal trials by reason of variances between writings produced in evidence and the recital or setting forth thereof in the indictment or information, and the same cannot now be amended at the trial, except in cases of misdemeanor; for remedy thereof, it shall and may be lawful for any Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery, if such Court shall see fit so to do, to cause the indictment or information for any offence whatever, when any variance or variances shall appear between any matter in writing or in print produced in evidence and the recital or setting forth thereof in the indictment or information whereon the trial is pending, to be forthwith amended in such particular or particulars by some officer of the Court, and after such amendment the trial shall proceed in the same manner in all respects, both with regard to the liability of witnesses to be indicted for perjury and otherwise as if no such variance or variances had appeared.

report every instance of neglect or disobedience to the Governor; he will frequently visit the police stations in each district, hear any complaints from the men, inquire into them, inspect the stabling and horses, also every part of the establishment, and examine all diaries and reports, a statement after such inspection will be required of him, with general remarks as to the condition of each station, for the information of the Governor; he will be required to examine all expenditure and charges of the force with a view to their reduction, if possible; he will examine on oath into the truth of any charges or complaints preferred against any person belonging to the force, of any neglect or violation of duty of his office, and report thereon for the information of the Governor, and any person who on such inquiry, or on any other occasion on which an oath may be administered under this Act shall give false evidence or take a false oath, and be thereof duly convicted, shall be deemed guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury, and shall be liable to such pains and penalties as persons convicted of wilful and corrupt perjury are or may be subject and liable to; he shall have the power to inflict small ’fines on the police officers of said force, not exceeding Sixteen Shillings, for neglect of any duty, stopping said penalties from the next issue of pay to such police officers, or he may stop their leave of absence, or order additional drill or duty, to the best of his discretion and judgment, his decision being in all cases to be forthwith reported to the Governor for his approval or disallowance, and in any case in which such police officer wishes to submit such decision to his Excellency he shall be at liberty to forward the same to the Governor through such channel as shall from time to time be pointed out, he shall have the power to suspend officers of the force, and to place them under arrest, but must forthwith report such proceeding to the Governor: he will be required to forward to the Governor half monthly returns of a (prescribed) form, with any remarks he may think necessary for promoting the efficiency of the force. The Superintending-serjeant shall be under the immediate command and direction of the Inspector-General, and shall promptly and strictly attend to all the orders issued by him, and see that they are duly observed; and he shall to the utmost of his power uphold the authority of the Inspector-General in all things relating to the public service. On the zeal, activity, and intelligence of the serjeants much depends, as from their closer intercourse with the men, their example and performance of their duties will the more frequently meet their eye; on this account, particularly, they must never spare themselves when the public service requires their assistance; they must exact a ready obedience to their orders.

and in the event of non-compliance on the part of any of the men they must, without any altercation, and with coolness and temper, forthwith confine the individual offending, reporting same to the Inspector-General; and in the event of any man complaining of injustice towards him, such complaint must be forwarded by the serjeant of the district to the Inspector-General. By a strict and uniform attention to all the duties and orders of their posts they will best consult their own interest, as such a line of conduct will place them . above the fear of recrimination in the event of their being obliged to report any misconduct on the part of their men, from whom it will be necessary for them to observe a proper distance, which will prevent, on their part, that want of respect for their authority which generally ensues from undue familiarity; they must respect and uphold the authority of their superiors, and check at once any inclination on the part of their men to speak disrespectfully of them, or of any magistrate or other authority; they must be perfectly impartial in the roister for the different duties of their poets, and must make a true entry in the diary of the station of all patrolling and every duty performed by them; they will be held strictly responsible for the appearance of their men and barracks, the condition of their horses, the state of their arms, ammunition, and appointments, and every article of public property committed to their charge; they must set an example of neatness in their dress and appointments, and if they suffer intoxication, disobedience of orders or neglect of duty, without reporting such as early as practicable to the Inspector-General, they will subject themselves to be reduced to the rank of privates, by the Governor, or to instant dismissal, as unfit for the service, or to any punishment which in addition a court-martial may award, should the Governor deem it necessary to bring the offender to trial; they must endeavour to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with all roads, passes, residences, and characters in their districts; and, in short, be enabled to give ample information on all such points whenever called on; they will carefully inspect all parties coming off and going on duty, and see that the arms and ammunition are in perfect and serviceable order: they will particularly observe that their men are perfectly sober on both those occasions; they must take care that all orders are carefully read and explained to their men, and that all standing rules and regulations are strictly adhered to; they will take every convenient opportunity of drilling their men, and must make a careful inspection, at least once in each fortnight, of their clothing. As the police officers may hope to rise by activity, intelligence, and good conduct to a superior rank, and as they dannot hold the superior office, no matter how exemplary their conduct, without, being able to write an official report or letter to the satisfaction of the Inspector-General, it will be the interest of each private to devote every hour which he can spare from his duty to qualify himself for promotion and to the general improvement of his mind. He must be neat and clean in his dress and appearance, and dressed on all occasions of duty in uniform, he must be prepared at all times for any duty which may be required of him, and readily and punctually obey the orders and instructions of his serjeant, always bearing in mind that his first duty is perfect obedience to all the lawful orders of his superiors, which he should receive with respect and deference. He is to be ever on the alert for the prevention of crime, and is never to omit to report to his superior officer any'circumstance which may appear to affect the public peace, or the force in the most remote degree. As unanimity amongst the force is of the highest importance, any man who is inclined to disturb that harmony, or to quarrel with his comrades, will be considered unfit for promotion. It will further be the duty of each individual of the police to cultivate the good opinion of the gentry and people of all classes in the Island, which he may hope to obtain by a proper demeanour, by sober and orderly habits, with a prompt desire to afford every assistance to all persons needing it, and a ready zeal to execute the lawjful orders and commands of the magistrates and those in authority over him; he should also be sedulous to cultivate a good understanding with the army, navy, and all other public services. No police officer is on any account to enter any house when patrolling, or on any other duty, except in the execution of his duty, or in case of extreme emer-

He will be particularly careful to abstain from the use of intoxicating liquors, which would incapacitate him for the proper discharge of his duties, and every instance of drunkenness on duty will meet with immediate dismissal, or such other punishment as the Inspector-General may be authorized to award, subject to the approval of the Governor; and in all instances of drunkenness at other times, if not visited by dismissal will be severely punished, and no excuse will be allowed for the degree of intoxication.

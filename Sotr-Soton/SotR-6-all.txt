PREFACE TO THIS VOLUME.

THE Sixth Volume of The Statutes of the Realm contains the Statutes from the Commencement of the Reign of King James the Second, A.D. 1685, to the End of the 6th and 7th Years of the Reign of King William and Queen Mary, A.D. 1694.

---

This Volume has been printed, and the Chronological Table and Index have been framed, in strict conformity with the Principles referred to in the Preface to the Fifth Volume; and it is therefore unnecessary to repeat them here: it may however be proper to mention, that although Queen Mary appears to have died between the passing of the Statutes Chapter II. and Chapter III. of the 6th and 7th Years of the Reign of King William and Queen Mary, yet the Heading is continued throughout those Years “ 6 & 7 Gul. & Mar./' as the Record affords no Authority for breaking the Year: Indeed it seems probable, had the Attention of the Legislature at that time been called to the Subject, that the Statute which now stands as Chapter III. 6 & 7 William and Mary, would have followed a corresponding Heading upon a new Parliament Roll as Chapter I. 1 William III.; as it is obvious that no Year or Chapter from the last Act of the Reign of William and Mary could have been correctly designated as a continuing Year or Chapter of the Reign of William the Third.

Three Engravings, the First, of the Act for removing and preventing Questions and Disputes concerning the assembling and sitting of the then present Parliament, 1 William and Mary; the Second, of the Act for establishing the Coronation Oath, 1 William and Mary; and the Third, of the Act for recognizing King William and Queen Mary, and for avoiding all Questions touching the Acts made in the Parliament assembled at Westminster the 13th Feb. 1688, 2 William and Mary, are inserted respectively at Pages 23, 56, and 156 of this Volume.

And whereas by the Laws relateing to their Majesties Revenue of Excise It is enacted That Gaugers have power to gauge all Coppers Fatts and Vessells in any Brewhouse and all other places whatsoever belonging to or used by any Brewer Innkeeper Victualler or other Retailer of Beere or Ale and to take an accompt of Beere Ale and Worts from time to time brewed or made and thereof to make Returne and Report in Writeing to the Commissioners and Subcommissioners of Excise and such Returns to be a Charge upon such Brewers Now for the preventing of Frauds and Disputes which may happen or arise by the Gaugers makeing their Returns [as1] aforesaid Bee it enacted by the authoritie aforesaid That where it shall appeare to the Gauger or Gaugers that any Worts are missing or not lett fairely downe into the Tun and such Gauger cannot finde the same in such Case it shall be lawfull [for such Gauger'] to charge such Brewer Victualler or other Retailer with soe much Beere or Ale as such Worts soe missing would reasonably make

And forasmuch as it is found by Experience that the payment of their Majesties Duties on Strong Waters Aqua vite and Spirits is much avoided and defrauded by the Distillers or makers of the Commodities aforesaid by reason that the Gaugers and Officers appointed to gauge and charge those Liquors are not duely admitted and permitted to enter and come into the Houses Distilling-houses or Store-houses and other places belonging to or used by such Distillers or Makers of such Strong Waters Aqua vite and Spirits and the penalties imposed by the former Acts are often avoided for such dcnyall or refusall because proofe cannot be made by the Informers or Officers of any Sale made of any their Commodities before the Duty thereof is paid Bee it enacted by the authoritie aforesaid That from

An Act for the better Explanation and supplying the Defe&f of the former Laws for the Settlement of

WHEREAS one A& of Parliament made in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth years of His late Majesty King Charles the Second Entituled An Act for the better Relief of the Poor of this Kingdom (except what relates to the Corporation therein mentioned and constituted thereby) was revived anil continued with some Alterations by one other AS made in the First yeare of the late King James the Second and have been found [by experience'] to bee good and wholesom Laws but may shortly expire. Be it therefore enatted by the King and Queens most Excellent Majesties by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled and by authority of the same That the said Aftf as to what relates to the Settlement^ of the Poor shall be in force from the First day of March One thousand six hundred ninety one.

But forasmuch as the said A&f are somewhat defective and doubtfull for supplying and explaining the same Be it further provided and enacted by the Authority aforesaid That the Forty days cotinuance of such person in a Parish or Towne intended by the said A&C to make a Settlement shall be accounted from the Publication of a Notice in Writing which he or she shall deliver of the House of his or her Abode and the number of his or her Family if he or she have any to the Churchwarden or Overseer of the Poor which said Notice in Writing the said Churchwarden or Overseer of the Poor is or are hereby required to read or cause to be read publickely immediately after Divine Service in the Church or Chappel of the said Parish or Towne on the next LordC day when there shall be Divine Service in the same And the said Churchwarden or Overseer of the Poor is or are hereby required to register or cause to be registred the said Notice in Writing in the Book kept for the Poors Accounts.

And be it further Enacted That if any Churchwarden or Overseer of the Poor shall refuse or neglett to read or cause to bee read such Notice in Writeing as aforesaid in such manner place and time as aforesaid he or they for every such Offence (upon proof thereof by two credible Witnesses upon Oath before any Justice of the Peace of the same County Riding or Division City or Towne Corporate where complaint thereof shall be made) shall forfeit the Sum of Forty shillingf to the use of the party grieved to be levied by Distresse and Sale of the Offender or Offenders Goods by Warrant under the Hand and Seal of any Justice of the Peace within the said Jurisdictions respectively to the Constable of the Parish or Towne where such Offender or Offenders dwell the Overplus if any be to be returned to the Owner or Owners and for want of such sufficient Distresse the said Justice shall committ him or them to the Common Goal of the said County City or Towne-Corporate there to remain without Bail or Mainprize for the space of one Month and if any Churchwarden or Overseer of the Poor shall refuse or neglect to register or cause to be registred such Notice in Writeing as aforesaid he or they so offending upon the like Conviction shall forfeit the Sum of Forty shillingf to the use of the Poor of the Parish or Towne where such Offender or Offenders dwell to be levied as aforesaid the Overplus if any be to be returned to the Owner or

Owners and for want of such sufficient Distresse then the said Justice shall committ such Offender or Offenders

Notice in Writing be delivered and published as is hereby before required.

And it is hereby further Enatted That if any Unmarried person not having Child or Children shall be lawfully hired into any Parish or Towne for one yeare such Service shall be [adjudged & '] deemed a good Settlement therein though no such Notice in Writeing be delivered and published as is herein before required.

Writeing be delivered and published as aforesaid.

Provided always and be it hereby Enacted That if any person or persons shall find him her or themselves

And be it further Enacted That if any person be removed by virtue of this Act from one County Riding City Towne Corporate or Liberty to another by Warrant under the Hands and Seals of two Justices of the Peace the Churchwardens or Overseers of the Poor of the said Parish or Towne to which the said person shall be so removed are hereby required to receive the said person and if he or they shall refuse so to do he or they so refuseing or neglecting (upon proof thereof by Two Credible Witnesses upon Oath before any Justice of the Peace of the County Riding City or Towne Corporate to which the said person shall be [soe1] removed) shall forfeit for each Offence the sum of Five pounds to the use of the Poor of the Parish or Town from which the said person was removed to be levied by Distresse and Sale of the Offender or Offenders Goods by Warrant under the Hand and Seale of any Justice of the Peace of the County Riding City or Town-Corporate to which such person was removed to the Constable of the Parish or Towne where such Offender or Offenders dwell which Warrant the said Justice is hereby impowered and required to make the Overplus if any be to be returned to the Owner or Owners and for want of such sufficient Distresse then the said Justice shall committ the said Offender or Offenders to the Common Goal of the said County Riding City or Towne Corporate or Liberty there to remain without Bail or Mainprize for the space of Forty days.

Provided always and be it hereby Enacted that all such persons who think themselves agrieved with any such Judgment of the said two Justices may appeal to the next General Quarter Sessions of the Peace to be held for the County Riding City Towne-Corporate or Liberty from which the said person was so removed.

And whereas many inconveniences do daily arise in Cities Townes Corporate and Parishes where the Inhabitantf are very numerous by reason of the unlimited power of the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor who do frequently upon frivolous pretences (but chiefly for their owne private ends ) give relief to what persons and number they think fitt and such persons being entred into the Collection Bill do become after that a great charge to the Parish notwithstanding the occasion or pretence of their receiving Collection oftentimes ceases by which meanes the Rates for the Poor are daily increased contrary to the true intent of a Statute made in the Forty third yeare of the Raigne of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth Entituled An Act for the Relief of the Poor. For remedying of which and preventing the like abuses for the future Be it further Enacted That from and after the (2) First day of March there shall be provided and kept in every Parish (att the charge of the same Parish) a Book or Book? wherein the Names of all such persons who do or may receive Collection shall be registred with the day and year when they were first admitted to have Relief and the occasion which [brought1] them under that necessity And that yearly in Easter Week (or as often as it shall be thought convenient) the Parishioners of every Parish shall meet in their Vestry or other usual place of meeting in the same Parish before whom the said Book shall be produced and all persons receiving Collection to be called over and the reasons of their taking relief examined and a new List made and entered of such persons as they shall think fitt and allow to receive Collection and that no other person be allowed to have or receive Collection att the Charge of the said Parish but by Authority under the Hand of one Jusuce of the Peace residing within such Parish or (if none be there dwelling) in the Parts near or next adjoyning or by Order of the Justices in their respective Quarter Sessions except in cases of Pestilential Diseases Plague or Small Pox for and in respect of such Families only as are or shall be therewith infeCted.

Wherefore to prevent all such evil and deceitful practices of Churchwardens and Overseers and other persons Be it enacted and declared That in all ACtions to be brought in Their Majesties Courts of Record att Westminster or at the Assizes for recovery of any Sum or Sums of money so mispent or taken by Churchwardens or Overseers of the Poor the Evidence of the Parishioners or any of them other then of such as receive Alms or any Pension or Gift out of such Collections or publick moneys of such Parish or Parishes respectively whereof the Defendant or DefcndantC is or are Inhabitant or Inhabitantf shall be taken and admitted in all such cases in the Courts aforesaid Any Custome Rule Order or Usage to the contrary notwithstanding.4]

An Acr for the regaining encourageing and settling the Greenland Trade

WHEREAS the Trade to Greenland and the Greenland Seas in the fishing for Whales there hath been heretofore a very beneficial Trade to this Kingdom not only in the imploying great numbers of Seamen and Ships and consuming great quantities of Provisions but also in the bringing into this Nation great quantities of Oyl Blubber and Fins. And whereas neighbouring Nations do yearely make great advantage thereby not only supplying themselves with that sort of Oyl and Fins but by vending into other parts great quantities thereof and particularly • into this Kingdom where the said Trade is now quite decayed and lost. And whereas several Merchantf of this Kingdom did heretofore endeavour to settle and regain the said Trade and for their encouragement therein it was by an Att of Parliament made in the Five and twentieth yeare of the Raigne of His late Majesty King Charles the second entituled An Act for the incouragement of the Greenland and Eastland Trades and for the better secureing the Plantation Trade (amongst other things) enabled That [in regard4] there was then great want of Harpinierers and Seamen skilled and exercised in the Trade of Whale fishing it should and might be lawfull for any Ship or Vessel truely belonging to England Wales or the Towne of Berwick upon Tweed and whereof the Master should be an Englishmen and inhabiting within the Places aforesaid from and after the First day of May which was in the yeare of our Lord One thousand six hundred seventy and three and until the Five and twentieth day of March which was in the yeare of our Lord One thousand six hundred eighty and three employed for the catching of Whales dureing such Voyage to be navigated with one moiety of the Harpinierers and one moiety [of the rest4] of the Mariners only English and yet to pay no further or other Custom for the Oyl Blubber or Fins caught or imported in such Ship or Vessel then if such Ship or Vessel had been navigated with Three fourths of the Mariners English Which said Att was by another Att of Parliament made in the Second yeare of Their present Majesties Reign entituled An Act for granting to Their Majesties a Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage and other Sums of Money payable upon Merchandizes exported and imported continued for Four years. And whereas several Merchantf and other Persons of this Kingdom were by the (5) first recited Att encouraged to fit out and send to the said Greenland Seas some Ships or Vessels for the catching of Whales whereby some small quantities of Oyl Blubber and Whale Fins were imported into this Kingdom but they not being able to carry on the said Trade upon their single or separate Interests in regard that the neighbouring Nations did yearly [send4] far greater numbers of Ships into those Seas the said Merchantf and other Persons of this Kingdom were forced to desist from following the said Trade which is now wholly ingrossed by Foreigners And since the expiration and revival of the said Att there hath not been any Ships sent from England to the said Greenland Seas or any Oyl Blubber or Whale Fins imported into England but such as have been bought of Foreigners whereby great sums of money are yearely drawne out of England for those Commodities and the Rates and Prizes which are now paid for the same arc now above six times more then heretofore they were and

CHAPTER XX.

An Act for the Kings most gracious general and free pardon.

WILLIAM. R.

THE Kings most excellent Majesty observing that his Royal inclination to mercy (which hath appeared as well by a most general and free pardon as by many particular instances of grace extended to such as had made

themselves obnoxious to the Laws) hath not had soe good an effect as might justly bee expected but on the

contrary diverse obstinate and incorrigible persons have been thereby rather encouraged and emboldened to enter into treasonable and seditious designes and practices hath heretofore upon mature deliberation found it necessary in order to the peace and quiet of his Kingdomes and the happy estate of his good Subjeflf and hath accordingly

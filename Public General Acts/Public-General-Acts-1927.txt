3. Whereas in pursuance of an agreement made in

the year eighteen hundred and ninety-two the sum of

ten thousand pounds was advanced by the Public Works

Loan Commissioners to the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees

on the security of the harbour revenues with the

collateral security of the Fishery Board for Scotland:

And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by

section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the

liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect

of the said loan was extinguished without prejudice to

the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay

the said loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said

collateral security is the sole security for the repayment

of the said loan:

And whereas the terms of the said collateral

security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement

between the Secretary for Scotland and the Public

Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of

March, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a

portion of the surplus herring brand fees as defined in

clause three of the said memorandum was pledged in

security for the repayment of the said loan with interest

by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the

security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for

the said loan, and it was provided that the said portion

of the surplus herring brand fees of any one year should

only be applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth

part of principal and interest on outstanding principal

falling due under the security for the said loan in the

same year, and should not be applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal:

And whereas the said portion of the surplus herring

brand fees so pledged as aforesaid will during the year

ending the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred

and twenty-seven, be insufficient to discharge in full the

instalment of principal with interest which falls due

under the security for the said loan in that year, and the

principal sum of two hundred pounds with interest

amounting to seventy-one pounds seventeen shillings,

will remain unpaid, and under the terms of the said

memorandum of agreement will be irrecoverable:

Now, therefore, the said prineipal sum of two

hundred pounds shall be extinguished, and the said

arrears of interest amounting to seventy-one pounds

by the Provisional Government (Transfer of Functions) ° ,

Order, 1922, and the Irish Free State Constitution Act, iri^Pree

persons in the Irish Free State out of the local loans | n r s P ect ° *

fund are (subject to certain deductions mentioned in

the said Order) required to be paid out of the Exchequer 0 i.

of the Irish Free State into the said fund:

And whereas by an agreement made the nineteenth

day of March, nineteen hundred and twenty-six, between

the British Government and the Government of the

Irish Free State it was provided (among other matters)

that the Government of the Irish Free State should

discharge their liability outstanding on the first day of

April, nineteen hundred and twenty-six, in respect of the local loans fund by the payment to the Fund for

a period of twenty years of an annuity of six hundred

thousand pounds, to be payable half-yearly on the first

day of January and the first day of July in each year,

the first half-yearly payment to be made on the first day

of July, nineteen hundred and twenty-six:

Now, therefore, notwithstanding anything in any

enactment, the said agreement is hereby confirmed; and

(1) The said annuity shall from time to time be

paid to the National Debt Commissioners and

may be accepted by them in lieu of the sums

which, but for the said agreement, would have

been payable by the Government of the Irish

Free State in respect of local loans:

(2) The income account of the local loans fund

shall, as from the thirty-first day of March,

nineteen hundred and twenty-six, cease to be

liable for any expenses incurred by the Government of the Irish Free State in or in relation to

the collection of sums due in respect of local ’

which was set up and commenced after the sixth day of

April, nineteen hundred and twenty-three, proves—

(a) that in any year earlier than the year 1926-27,

or than the year which would under the provisions of section thirty-four of the Finance

Act, 1926, be taken to be the year preceding

the year 1927-28, he sustained a loss (to be

computed in like manner as profits or gains

under the Rules applicable to Cases I and II

of Schedule D) in the trade, profession or

vocation; and

(i b)that that loss would, if Part IV of the Finance

Act, 1926, had not passed, have been taken into

account in the period upon the average of

which the profits or gains of the trade, profession or vocation would have been calculated

for the purposes of the assessment either for

the year 1927-28 or for both the said years

1927-28 and 1928-29,

respect of the profits or gains of the trade,

profession or vocation for the year 1927-28, or

(ii) both from that amount and from the amount on

which he is so assessed for the year 1928-29, if

the loss would have been taken into account in

the period upon the average of which the profits

or gains of the trade, profession or vocation

would have been calculated for the purpose of the assessment for that last-mentioned year:

Provided that the amount of the deduction to be

allowed to any person under this section in respect of the assessment for either of the said years shall not be

in excess of the amount by which the aggregate amount

of the assessments made on him in respect of the trade,

profession or vocation for the period from the first setting

up thereof until the end of that year (as reduced by

any deduction under this section or by any deduction allowed under Rule 13 of the Rules applicable to

Cases I and II of Schedule D on account of losses

arising in the trade) is greater than the amount by

1927.

Finance Act, 1927.

Ch. 10.

which his aggregate profits and gains from the trade,

profession or vocation for the said period exceeds the

aggregate amount of his losses therefrom during that

period, after deducting from those losses any loss or

portion of a loss which has been or can be carried

forward under section thirty-three of the Finance Act,

1926, and the amount of any loss or losses in respect of

which relief is given under section thirty-four of the

Income Tax Act, 1918.

to any person under this section, he shall not be entitled

to claim relief in respect of that loss under any other

provision of the Income Tax Acts.

(3) For the purpose of the application of this

section to any person, the expressions “ the amount

“ on which he is assessed in respect of the profits

“ or gains ” and “ the aggregate amount of the assess-

“ merits made on him ” shall in respect of any year

or period be taken to mean the amount or the aggregate of the amounts respectively which that person

would be required under the Income Tax Acts to include

in respect of the profits of the trade, profession, or

vocation in his return or returns of total income for that

year or period if the return or returns were made before

taking into account any adjustment under section thirty-

four of the Income Tax Act, 1918, or any deduction or

set off under section thirty-three of the Finance Act, 1926,

in respect of a loss.

29. — (1) If, where a business carried on by any

individual or by any individuals in partnership has,

transferred to a company in consideration solely or mainly

of the allotment of shares of the company to that individual

or those individuals, the total income as computed for

the purposes of income tax of any individual to whom or

to whose nominee or nominees shares have been so allotted

opinion that there has not been and will not be

any avoidance of the payment of super-tax

through failure to distribute to the members of the company a reasonable part of its income for

that year or period, may make a statutory

declaration to that effect stating the facts and

circumstances upon which their opinion is based;

(b) In any case where such a statutory

declaration as aforesaid is sent to the Special

Commissioners within twenty-eight days of the

issue of such a notice or the giving of such a

direction as aforesaid the Special Commissioners

1922—

“9. The income apportioned to a member of

a company so far as assessable and chargeable to

super-tax under section twenty-one of this Act

shall for the purposes of that tax be deemed

to have been received by him on the date

to which the accounts of the company for the

year or period were made up or, if an application

in that behalf is made by the company to the

Special Commissioners at any time within the

period limited by this Schedule for giving notice

of appeal against the direction to the Special

Commissioners, on such date as those Commissioners determine to be just, having regard to

the dates on which distributions of income have

been made by the company, and so as to avoid,

as far as possible, the inclusion for the purposes

of super-tax for any year of income referable to

more than one year.”

32. — (1) Where a member of a company (in this

section referred to as “the first company”), the income

of which for any year or period has been deemed to be

the income of its members and has been the subject of

an apportionment (in this section referred to as “the

original apportionment ”) under section tw enty-one of the Finance Act, 1922, is itself a company (in this section

referred to as “ the second company ”) to which the provisions of that section apply, the excess of the amount

so apportioned to the second company over the amount,

if any, W'hich has been received by the second company

out of the income as aforesaid of the first company

in such manner as would, in the case of an individual,

render the amount so received liable to be included in

the statement of his income for the purposes of supertax, shall for the purposes of the said section be deemed

to be income of the members of the second company and

shall be apportioned among them in accordance with

their iespective interests in that company, and the

1927.

Finance Act, 1927.

Ch. 10.

51

provisions of the said section shall, with any necessary

modifications, apply accordingly.

(2) The second company shall, on being required

by notice in writing to that effect given to it by the

Special Commissioners, furnish the Commissioners with a

statement showing the names and addresses and particulars of the respective interests of all its members as

on the last day of the year or other period the income of

which formed the subject of the original apportionment,

and the income apportioned as aforesaid to the members

of the second company shall, for the purposes of supertax, be deemed to have been received by those members

on the date on which the income apportioned as aforesaid to the members of the first company is deemed to

have been received by them.

(3) Any super-tax chargeable by reference to the

provisions of the said section twenty-one in respect

of the amount of the income of the first company

apportioned to any member of the second company shall

be assessed upon that member in the name of the first

company, and shall, subject to the provisions of the said

section as to payment by the member, be payable by the

first company, and the provisions of the said section as

to the assessment, collection and recovery of super-tax

chargeable in respect of the income of a company

apportioned to any member thereof shall, with any

necessary modifications, apply accordingly.

(4) Where a member of any such second company as aforesaid is itself a company to which the

said section twenty-one applies, the income apportioned to it under the foregoing provisions of this

section shall in turn be deemed to be the income

of its members and apportioned to them, for purposes

of assessment to super-tax, in accordance with their

respective interests, and so on successively where any

member to whom income of a company has been

apportioned is itself a company to which the said

section applies, so that successive apportionments shall

in like manner be made until the entire amount of the

income which was apportioned under the provisions of this section among the members of the second company

has been apportioned to persons other than a company

to which the said section applies, and the said section

shall with any necessary modifications apply to such

successive apportionments and to the furnishing of statements and to the assessment, collection and recovery of

super-tax in respect of income apportioned thereunder,

and, in particular, the date on which any such income

is to be deemed to have been received by the member to

whom it is apportioned shall be the date mentioned in

subsection (2) of this section, and any super-tax which is

chargeable in respect of income apportioned to a member

being an individual shall be assessed and charged upon

that member in the name of the first company.

Provisions 33. — (1) Any individual upon whom notice is served

for prevent- by the Special Commissioners requiring him to furnish a

anc T d - statement of and particulars relating to any assets in

supertax which, at any time during the period specified in the

by sales notice, he has had any beneficial interest, and in respect

cumdivi- of which, within such period, either no income was

dend, &o. received by him, or the income received by him was less

than the sum to which the income would have amounted,

if the income from such assets had accrued from day to

day and been apportioned accordingly, shall, whether an

assessment to super-tax in respect of his total income has

or has not been made for the relevant year or years of

assessment, furnish such a statement and such particulars

in the form and within the time (not being less than

twenty-eight days) required by the notice.

(2) The Special Commissioners may serve further

notices whenever they consider it necessary for the

purposes of this section until complete particulars have

been furnished to their satisfaction.

(3) If it appears to the Special Commissioners by

reference to all the circumstances in relation to the

assets of any such individual (including circumstances

with respect to sales, purchases, dealings, contracts,

arrangements, transfers, or any other transactions

relating to such assets) that the individual has thereby

avoided or would avoid more than ten per cent, of the amount of the super-tax for any year which

would have been payable in his case if the income from

those assets had been deemed to accrue from day to day

and had been apportioned accordingly and the income so

deemed to have been apportioned to him had been

treated as part of his total income from all sources for

the purposes of super-tax, then those assets shall be

1927. Finance Act, 1927. Ch. 10.

deemed to be assets to which subsection (4) of this

section applies.

(4) For the purposes of assessment to super-tax in

the case of any such individual, the income from any

assets to which this subsection applies shall be deemed

to accrue from day to day, and in the case of the sale or

transfer of any such assets by or to him shall be deemed

to have been received as and when it is deemed to have

accrued:

Provided that an individual shall not be liable to

be assessed to super-tax under this section in respect

of any such income if he proves to the satisfaction of the Special Commissioners that the avoidance of supertax was exceptional and not systematic, and that there

was not in his case in any of the three next preceding

years any such avoidance of super-tax as is described

in the provisions of the last preceding subsection.

(5) If any individual fails to furnish any statement

or particulars required under this section, or if the

Special Commissioners are not satisfied with any statement or particulars furnished under this section, they

may make an estimate of the amount of the income

which, under the foregoing provisions of this section, is

to be deemed to form part of his total income for the

purposes of super-tax.

(6) If any individual without reasonable excuse

fails to furnish any statement or particulars required

under this section, he shall be liable to a penalty not

exceeding fifty pounds, and, after judgment has been

given for that penalty, to a further penalty of the like

amount for every day during which the failure continues.

(7) For the purposes of this section, the expression

“ assets ” means—•

(a) stocks or securities entitled to interest or

dividend at a fixed rate only, not being stocks

or securities the interest or dividend on which

is dependent on the earnings of a company;

and

(b) any other stocks or securities and any shares,

if transactions in relation- thereto have been

effected by the individual otherwise than

through a stock exchange in the United Kingdom and by a transfer on which duty has

under the heading “ Conveyance or Transfer

Act, 1891.

34. If, on an application made by any individual

for the purpose, either at the time of making his return

for the purposes of super-tax for any year or within the

time limited for appealing against the assessment upon

him to super-tax for that year, the applicant proves to

the satisfaction of the Special Commissioners—

(a) that, as respects any assets, in consequence of the operation of the provisions of the Income

Tax Acts which require that for purposes of

super-tax any income which is chargeable with

income tax by way of deduction shall be

deemed to be income of the year in which it

is receivable, the income from those assets, as

estimated for the purposes of super-tax for

which would be attributable to a period of one

full year if the income were deemed to have

accrued from day to day; and

(b) that, in consequence, the amount of super-tax

payable by him for that year exceeds by more

than five per cent, the amount of the supertax which would have been payable by him

for that year if the amount of his income from

those assets had not exceeded the amount which

would be attributable to a period of one full

year if the income from those assets were

deemed to have accrued from day to day;

the Special Commissioners shall charge him to super-tax,

or adjust his liability to super-tax, for that year and any

succeeding year so as to give such relief as may be just,

having regard to all the circumstances and in particular

to the amount of any liability or additional liability to

super-tax which would have arisen for any preceding

year or years if—

(i) the income from such assets as aforesaid were

deemed to have accrued from day to day and

to have been apportioned accordingly; and

(ii) the income so deemed to have been apportioned

to him had been treated as part of his total

income for the purposes of super-tax.

35. If, on an application made by any individual,

either at the time of making his return for the purposes

of super-tax for any year or within the time limited for

appealing against the assessment upon him to super-tax

for that year, the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Special Commissioners that, in consequence of the

sale or transfer to him of any assets, the amount of

super-tax payable by him for that year exceeds by more

than ten per cent, the amount of the super-tax which

would have been payable by him for that year if the

income from those assets and from any assets sold or

transferred by him were deemed to have accrued from

day to day, then, for the purposes of any assessment to

super-tax in the case of that individual for that year,

the income from all such assets as aforesaid shall be

deemed to have accrued from day to day and to have

been received by him as and when it is deemed to have

accrued.

36. —(1) Any income arising in respect of any assets

which for any of the purposes of the last three preceding

sections of this Act is deemed to have accrued from day

to day or which is to be computed as if it were income

that accrued from day to day shall—

(a) if payable in respect of any stated period, be

deemed to have accrued from day to day during

that period; and

(b) if not payable in respect of any stated period,

be deemed to have accrued from day to day

during the period of twelve months next preceding the date on which that income was

declared payable, or during the period between

the last previous declaration of a dividend,

(not being a dividend expressed to be an

interim dividend in respect of a stated period)

ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX ON HIGHER INCOME, BASIS

OF ASSESSMENT UNDER SCHEDULE E., &C.

38. —(1) Income tax for the year 1928-29 and every

subsequent year shall, instead of being charged at a single

rate, be charged at a standard rate and, in the case of an

individual whose total income from all sources exceeds a

stated amount, at a rate or rates exceeding the standard

rate in respect of any part or parts of his income in

excess of that amount, and where income tax is so

charged for any year the following provisions shall have

effect, subject to the other provisions of this Part of this Act —

(a) all such enactments relating to income tax as

were in force immediately before the commencement of this Part of this Act shall, in so far as

they relate to income tax (not including supertax) have effect as if income tax were charged

for that year at the standard rate only, and in

the case of an individual whose total income

exceeds the stated amount, the amount of the

income tax so charged shall, so far as that

income tax is borne by him in respect of his

income, be deemed to be an instalment at the

standard rate of the amount of income tax for

which he is chargeable for that year;

(b) where the amount of income tax payable by an

individual for that year in respect of his total

income is greater than the amount which would

have been payable by him in respect thereof if

income tax had been chargeable at the standard

rate only, the difference between those two

amounts (in this Part of this Act referred to as

1927.

Finance Act, 1927.

Ch. 10.

income tax according to the provisions of this

Part of this Act relating to sur-tax;

and super-tax shall not be charged for the year 1929-30

or any subsequent year.

any person means the total income of that person from

all sources estimated, as the case may be, either in

accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts

as they apply to income tax chargeable at the standard

rate or in accordance with those provisions as they

apply to sur-tax.

Provided that this subsection shall not—

(a) apply to the deduction to be made under

Rule 1 of No. VIII. in Schedule A.; or

(b) affect the first proviso to Rule 4 of the said

No. VIII. relating to deductions in Scotland.

(2) In estimating under the Income Tax Acts the

total income of any person, any income which is

chargeable with income tax by way of deduction at the

be income of that year, and any deductions which are

allowable on account of sums payable under deduction

of income tax at the standard rate in force for any year

out of the property or profits of .that person shall be

allowed as deductions in respect of that year, notwithstanding that the income or sums, as the case may be,

accrued or will accrue in whole or in part before or after

that year.

39. — (1) Such of the provisions of the Income Tax

Acts as provide that income tax may be deducted from

any payment at the rate or rates of tax in force during the

period through which the payment was accruing due, or

that there may be deducted from any dividend the tax

appropriate thereto, or that a proportionate deduction

of the tax charged shall be allowed by any person out of

of a patent, he shall, in respect of so much of the property, profits or gains as is equal to the said payment

and may be deducted in computing his total income, be

charged at the standard rate only.

40. — (1) The enactments set out in Part I of the

Fifth Schedule to this Act in so far as they provide for

relief from income tax either by means of a deduction

from assessable income or from the amount of earned

income or from the amount of total income, shall, subject

to the amendments specified in the third column of the

said Part I, have effect as if the} 7 provided for relief from

income tax by means of a deduction from the amount of

income tax with which any individual is chargeable equal

to tax at the standard rate on the amount of the

deduction from income to which he would have been

entitled under the said provisions:

Provided that the amount of any deduction under

this subsection shall be subject to such adjustment as

may be proper in any case where relief is given in respect

of Dominion income tax.

tax to Avhich he is entitled under subsection (1) of this

section reduced by a further deduction equal to one-half

of the amount so remaining chargeable or equal to

one-lialf the tax at the standard rate on two hundred

and twenty-five pounds, whichever is the less:

Provided that, where an individual has received

relief from United Kingdom income tax in respect of

Dominion income tax, the deduction to be made under

this subsection shall not be less than it would have been

if no such relief had been given, but nothing in this

subsection shall affect any adjustment required to be made

under subsection (3) of section twenty-seven of the

Finance Act, 1920 (which provides for an adjustment

(3) Where under the provisions of the Income Tax

Acts an individual is entitled to claim relief from income

tax (other than relief in respect of life insurance premiums), by repayment or otherwise, in respect of any

amount which is paid or borne by him out of his income

or which is allowable or may be deducted therefrom, or in

respect of any reduction of an assessment relating to his

income or any part thereof, or in respect of any adjustment or set off with regard to a loss, and claims that

relief for any year of assessment, any relief granted

shall not extend so as to make the total income tax paid

or payable by that individual for that year less than it

would have been if the amount in respect of which relief

is claimed had been deducted in computing his total

income for that year and the amount of any other

deductions or reliefs to which he is entitled for that year

had been determined accordingly.

(4) Any reference in any provision of the Income

the standard rate has under the provisions of the

Income Tax Acts become final and conclusive for any

year, the assessment shall also be final and conclusive

for the purpose of estimating total income for the purpose of sur-tax for that year, and no allowance or

adjustment of liability on the ground of diminution of

income or loss shall be taken into account in estimating

the total income for that purpose, unless that allowance

regard to the desirability of securing, as far as may be

possible, that no person shall be required to make more

than one return annually of the sources of his income

that year.

(2) In any case in which it appears to the Special

Commissioners that the particulars contained in any

return made by any person, whether acting on his own

behalf or as representing an incapacitated, non-resident,

or deceased person, are insufficient to enable them to

assess and charge sur-tax or that any person has failed

to make a return, the Special Commissioners may serve

upon him, in manner prescribed by regulations under

this Part of this Act, a notice requiring him to make a

return of his total income or of the total income of the

incapacitated, non-resident, or deceased person, as the

case may be, and every person so required shall, whether

he is or is not chargeable with sur-tax, make such a return

further penalty of the like amount for every day during

which the default continues.

(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Part of this Act, section one hundred and thirty-two of the Income

Tax Act, 1918 (which contains provisions against fraudulent practices) shall apply for the purposes of sur-tax

as it applies for purposes of income tax at the standard

rate, subject to the modification that for the words

‘‘the general commissioners for the division in which

“ he has been charged, or if he has not been charged,

“ then for any division in which he is chargeable”

there shall be substituted the words “the Special Com-

“ missioners.”

of June, nineteen hundred and twenty-nine, be entitled

to require that any assessment under Schedule E for the

year 1928-29 in respect of that office or employment

or that annuity, pension or stipend shall be reduced to

emoluments of the preceding year, and thereupon the

assessment shall be so reduced and any tax overpaid

shall be repaid:

Provided that, where an assessment under Schedule E

emoluments for the period beginning on the sixth day of

April in that year and ending on the date of the

cessation, and, if tax has been charged otherwise than in

accordance with this provision, any tax overpaid shall

be repaid, or an additional assessment may be made, as

shares to be issued as such consideration as

aforesaid,

whichever amount is the less; and

Act, 1891, been stamped with a particular

stamp denoting either that it is not chargeable with any duty or that it is duly stamped;

and

(b) in the case of an instrument made for the purposes of or in connection with a transfer to a

company within the meaning of the Companies

share capital of the transferee company, as

the case may be; or

which has, in connection with a scheme of reconstruction

or amalgamation, issued any unissued share capital shall

be treated as if it had increased its nominal share

company shall be computed separately in relation to each

of those companies.

(5) Where a claim is made for exemption under this

section, the Commissioners of Inland Revenue may

require the delivery to them of a statutory declaration

in such form as they may direct, made in England by a

solicitor of the Supreme Court or in Scotland by an

enrolled law agent, and of such further evidence, if any,

as the Commissioners may reasonably require.

(6) If-

(a) where any claim for exemption from duty under

this section has been allowed, it is subsequently

found that any declaration or other evidence

furnished in support of the claim was untrue

in any material particular, or that the conditions specified in subsection (1) of tins

section are not fulfilled in the reconstruction

or amalgamation as actually carried out; or

(b) where shares in the transferee company have

been issued to the existing company in

consideration of the acquisition, the existing

company within a period of two years from

the date, as the case may be, of the registration or incorporation, or of the authority

for the increase of the capital, of the transferee company ceases, otherwise than in consequence of reconstruction, amalgamation or

liquidation, to be the beneficial owner of the

shares so issued to it; or

(c) where any such exemption has been allowed

in connection with the acquisition by the

period of two years from the date of its

registration or incorporation or of the authority for the increase of its capital, as the case

may be, ceases, otherwise than in consequence

of reconstruction, amalgamation or liquidation, to be the beneficial owner of the shares

so acquired;

become payable forthwith, and shall be recoverable

from the transferee company as a debt due to His

Majesty, together with interest thereon at the rate

of five per cent, per amium in the case of duty remitted under paragraph (A) of subsection (1) of this

section from the date of the registration or incorporation

of the transferee company or the increase of its capital,

as the case may be, and in the case of duty remitted

under paragraph (B) of the said subsection from the

date on which it would have become chargeable if this Act had not passed.

amalgamation the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are

satisfied that at the proper time for making a claim for

exemption from duty under subsection (1) of this section

there were in existence all the necessary conditions for

such exemption other than the condition that not less

than ninety per cent, of the issued share capital of the

existing company would be acquired by the transferee

may deem requisite for determining the question.

against any allowance, disallowance or surcharge, the Minister may decide the appeal according to the merits

of the case, and if he finds that any disallowance or

surcharge is or has been lawfully made, but that the

direct it to be remitted upon payment of the costs, if

any, which may have been incurred by the district

auditor or other competent authority in enforcing the

disallowance or surcharge.

CHAPTER 21.

An Act to amend the Law with respect to persons

carrying on business as Moneylenders.

[29th July 1927.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present

Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1.—(1) Every moneylender, whether carrying on

business alone or as a partner in a firm, shall take out

annually in respect of every address at which he carries

on his business as such, an excise licence (in this Act

referred to as “ a moneylender’s excise licence ”), which

shall expire on the thirty-first day of July in every year,

and, subject as hereinafter provided, there shall be

charged on every moneylender’s excise licence an excise

duty of fifteen pounds, or if the licence be taken out not

more than six months before the expiration thereof, of

ten pounds.

Provided that—

(a) the duty charged on any moneylender’s excise

licence which will expire on the thirty-first

day of July, nineteen hundred and twenty-

eight, shall, notwithstanding that the licence

may be taken out more than six months

before the expiration thereof, be a duty of

ten pounds; and

(b) where moneylender’s excise licences are taken

out by two or more moneylenders in respect

of any address or addresses at which they

carry on their business as partners in a firm,

the Commissioners of Customs and Excise

shall remit, or if the duty has been paid

repay, to the firm a sum equal to the aggregate of the duties charged on such number of the licences taken out as exceeds the number

of the addresses in respect of which they are

taken out; and

1927.

Moneylenders Act, 1927.

Ch. 21.

(c) where it is proved to the satisfaction of the

Commissioners of Customs and Excise that

there is in force a licence for carrying on

the business of a pawnbroker at any premises

in respect of which a moneylender’s excise

licence is taken out by the person carrying on

the business, the Commissioners shall remit,

or if the duty has been paid repay, to that

person such part of the duty charged on the

moneylender’s excise licence as is equal to

the amount of the duty paid in respect of the

licence for carrying on the business of a

pawnbroker, or where in any such case

moneylender’s excise licences are taken out

by partners in a firm in respect of the

premises, the remission or repayment shall

be made to the firm.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, moneylenders’ excise licences shall be in such form as the

Commissioners of Customs and Excise may direct,

and shall be granted on payment of the appropriate

duty by any officer of Customs and Excise authorised

by the Commissioners to grant them, and regulations

made by the said Commissioners may make provision

as to the procedure to be followed in making application for moneylenders’ excise licences:

Provided that a moneylender’s excise licence shall

be taken out by a moneylender in his true name, and

shall be void if it be taken out in any other name, but

every moneylender’s excise licence shall also show the

moneylender’s authorised name and authorised address.

(3) If any person—

(a) takes out a moneylender’s excise licence in

any name other than his true name; or

(b) carries on business as a moneylender without

having in force a proper moneylender’s excise

licence authorising him so to do, or, being

licensed as a moneylender, carries on business

as such in any name other than his authorised name, or at any other place than his

authorised address or addresses; or

(c) enters into any agreement in the course of his

business as a moneylender with respect to the

he shall be guilty of a contravention of the provisions

of this Act and shall for each offence be liable to an

excise penalty of one hundred pounds:

Provided that, on a second or subsequent conviction

of any person (other than a company) for an offence

under this subsection, the court may, in lieu of or in

addition to ordering the offender to pay the penalty

aforesaid, order him to be imprisoned for a term not

exceeding three months, and an offender being a company shall on a second or subsequent conviction be liable

to an excise penalty of five hundred pounds.

2.—(1) A moneylender’s excise licence shall not be

granted except to a person who holds a certificate granted

in accordance with the provisions of this section authorising the grant of the licence to that person, and a

separate certificate shall be required in respect of every

separate licence. Any moneylender’s excise licence

granted in contravention of this section shall be void.

(2) Certificates under this section (in this Act referred

to as “ certificates ”) shall be granted by the petty

sessional court having jurisdiction in the petty sessional

division in which the moneylender’s business is to be

carried on, so, however, that within any part of the

metropolitan police district for which a police court is

established, a certificate shall not be granted except by a

police magistrate.

(3) Every certificate granted to a moneylender shall

show his true name and the name under which, and the

address at which, he is authorised by the certificate to

carry on business as such, and a certificate shall not

authorise a moneylender to carry on business at more

than one address, or under more than one name, or

under any name -which includes the word “bank, ” or

otherwise implies that he carries on banking business,

and no certificate shall authorise a moneylender to carry

on business under any name except—

Act, 1900, and under the Registration of c. 61.

Business Names Act, 1916.

(4) A certificate shall come into force on the date

specified therein, and shall expire on the next following

thirty-first day of July.

(5) A Secretary of State shall make rules with

respect to the procedure to be followed in making

applications for certificates (including the notices to be

given of intention to make such an application), and

certificates shall be in such form as may be prescribed by

rules so made.

(6) A certificate shall not be refused except on

some one or more of the following grounds—

(a) that satisfactory evidence has not been produced of the good character of the applicant,

and in the case of a company of the persons

responsible for the management thereof;

(b) that satisfactory evidence has been produced

that the applicant, or any person responsible or

proposed to be responsible for the management

of his business as a moneylender, is not a fit and

proper person to hold a certificate;

(c) that the applicant, or any person responsible or

proposed to be responsible for the management

of his business as a moneylender, is by order of

a court disqualified for holding a certificate;

(d) that the applicant has not complied with the

provisions of any rules made under this section

with respect to applications for certificates.

(7) Any person aggrieved by the refusal of a petty

sessional court to grant a certificate may appeal to a

court of quarter sessions in manner provided by the

Summary Jurisdiction Acts as if the refusal were an

order of a court of summary jurisdiction.

charged exceeds the rate of forty-eight per cent, per

annum, or the corresponding rate in respect of any other

period, the court shall, unless the contrary is proved,

presume for the purposes of section one of the Moneylenders Act, 1900, that the interest charged is excessive

and that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable,

but this provision shall be without prejudice to the

powers of the court under that section where the court

is satisfied that the interest charged, although not

may be exercised notwithstanding that the moneylender’s

right of action for the recovery of the money lent is

barred.

virtue of this Act, then until the number of the members

in office is increased to not less than two-thirds of the

full number of members of the local authority—

(a) the quorum of the local authority shall be

determined by reference to the number of the

members of the local authority remaining

qualified instead of by reference to the full

number of members of the local authority;

(b) no provision preventing a returning officer

holding an election to fill a casual vacancy shall

apply to any vacancy in the office of members

the Minister of Health, (hereinafter referred to as the

“Minister”) and the Court or Minister shall have power

to confirm, vary or quash the decision of the auditor,

and to remit the case to the auditor with such directions

is quashed, or is varied so as to reduce the amount of the surcharge to five hundred pounds or less, the

appellant shall not be subject to the disqualification

imposed by this Act.

does not appeal, to the tribunal (whether the High

Court or the Minister) to which he might have appealed,

for a declaration that in relation to the subject matter

of the surcharge he acted reasonably or in the belief

that his action was authorised by law, and the Court

or Minister, if satisfied that there is proper ground for

doing so, may make a declaration to that effect, and

where such a declaration is made the person surcharged,

if by reason of the surcharge he is subject to the

disqualification imposed by this Act, shall not be subject to that disqualification, and the Court or Minister

may, if satisfied that the person surcharged ought fairly

to be excused, relieve him either wholly or partly from

personal liability in respect of the surcharge; the decision

of the Court or Minister under this subsection shall be

final and shall not be subject to appeal.

(3) Provision may be made by rules of court for

regulating appeals and applications to the High Court

under this section, and those rules shall provide for

limiting the time within which such appeals and applications may be made, and for securing that where an

application is made public notice of the hearing shall

be [given, and for enabling any ratepayer or owner of

shall be entitled, if he so desires, to a personal hearing

by a person appointed for the purpose by the Minister.

(5) The provisions as to the payment of costs

applicable to appeals under any enactment repealed by

this Act shall apply to appeals and applications to the

Court under this section.

(6) Where any proceedings in the High Court under

section thirty-five of the Poor Law Amendment Act,

1844, or under that section as applied by any other

enactment, for the removal into the High Court of any

twenty-seven, and the surcharge in respect of which the

sum which is certified by a district auditor to be due

shall be recoverable either summarily or otherwise as a

civil debt, and in any proceedings for the recovery of

such a sum any certificate purporting to be signed by a

district auditor shall, unless the contrary is proved, be

deemed to be a certificate signed by a district auditor,

and a certificate signed by a district auditor shall be

conclusive evidence of the facts certified, and a certificate

purporting to be signed by the treasurer of the local

authority concerned that the sum certified to be due has

not been paid to him shall be sufficient evidence of nonpayment, unless it is proved that the sum certified to be

due has been paid to the treasurer subsequently to the

date of the treasurer’s certificate.

(2) The provisions as to the payment of costs

applicable to the proceedings under the enactments

repealed by this Act for the recovery of sums certified

An Act to provide for the payment of compensation

for improvements and goodwill to tenants of

premises used for business purposes, or the

grant of a new lease in lieu thereof; and to

amend the law of landlord and tenant.

[22nd December 1927.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present

Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

Part I.

Compensation for Improvements and Goodwill on

THE TERMINATION OF TENANCIES OF BUSINESS

Premises,

1.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, a tenant of a holding to which this Part of this Act applies shall, if a claim for the purpose is made in

the prescribed manner—

(a) in the case of a tenancy terminated by notice,

within one month after the notice was served

on or by the tenant; and

(b) in any other case, not more than thirty-six nor

less than twelve months before the termination

of the tenancy;

Tenant’s

right to

compensation for

improvements.

432 Ch. 30. Landlord and Tenant 17 & 18 Geo. 5.

Act, 1927.

be entitled, at the termination of the tenancy, on quitting

his holding, to be paid by his landlord compensation in

respect of any improvement (including the erection of

any building) on his holding made by him or his

predecessors in title, not being a trade or other fixture

which the tenant is by law entitled to remove, which

at the termination of the tenancy adds to the letting

value of the holding:

Provided that the sum to be paid as compensation

for any improvement shall not exceed—

(a) the net addition to the value of the holding as

a whole which may be determined to be the

direct result of the improvement; or

(b) the reasonable cost of carrying out the improvement at the termination of the tenancy, subject

to a deduction of an amount equal to the

cost (if any) of putting the Avorks constituting

the improvement into a reasonable state of

repair, except so far as such cost is covered

by the liability of the tenant under any

coA r enant or agreement as to the repair of the

premises.

(2) In determining the amount of such net addition

as aforesaid, regard shall be had to the purposes for

which it is intended that the premises shall be used

after the termination of the tenancy, and if it is shoAvn

that it is intended to demolish or to make structural

alterations in the premises or any part thereof or to use

the premises for a different purpose, regard shall be had

to the effect of such demolition, alteration or change of

user on the additional value attributable to the improvement, and to the length of time likely to elapse betAveen

the termination of the tenancy and the demolition,

alteration or change of user.

(3) In the absence of agreement between the

parties, all questions as to the right to compensation

under this section, or as to the amount thereof, shall be

determined by the tribunal hereinafter mentioned, and if

the tribunal determines that, on account of the intention

to demolish or alter or to change the user of the

premises, no compensation or a reduced amount of compensation shall be paid, the tribunal may authorise a

further application for compensation to be made by the

1927.

Landlord and Tenant

Act, 1927.

Ch. 36.

433

tenant if effect is not given to the intention within such

ti m e as may be fixed by the tribunal.

2.—(1) A tenant shall not be entitled to compensation under this Part of this Act—

(a) in respect of any improvement made before the

commencement of this Act; or

(b) in respect of any improvement made in pursuance

of a statutory obligation, or of any improvement which the tenant or his predecessors in

title were under an obligation to make in

pursuance of a contract entered into, whether

before or after the passing of this Act, for

valuable consideration, including a building

lease; or

(c) in respect of any improvement made less than

three years before the termination of the

tenancy j or

(d) if within two months after the making of the

claim under section one, subsection (1), of this Act the landlord serves on the tenant notice

that he is willing and able to grant to the

tenant, or obtain the grant to him of, a renewal

of the tenancy at such rent and for such term

as, failing agreement, the tribunal may consider

reasonable; and, where such a notice is so served

and the tenant does not within one month from

the service of the notice send to the landlord

an acceptance in writing of the offer, the tenant

shall be deemed to have declined the offer.

(2) Where an offer of the renewal of a tenancy by

the landlord under this section is accepted by the tenant,

the rent fixed by the tribunal shall be the rent which

in the opinion of the tribunal a willing lessee other than

the tenant would agree to give and a willing lessor would

agree to accept for the premises, having regard to the

terms of the lease, but irrespective of the value

attributable to the improvement in respect of which

compensation would have been payable.

(3) The tribunal in determining the compensation for

an improvement shall in reduction of the tenant’s claim

take into consideration any benefits which the tenant

or his predecessors in title may have received from the

right to

compensation in

landlord or his predecessors in title in consideration

expressly or impliedly of the improvement.

Landlord’s 3.—(1) Where a tenant of a holding to which this

right to Part of this Act applies proposes to make an improve-

object. ment on his holding, he shall serve on his landlord

notice of his intention to make such improvement,

together with a specification and plan showing the

proposed improvement and the part of the existing

premises affected thereby, and if the landlord, within

three months after the service of the notice, serves on the

tenant notice of objection, the tenant may, in the prescribed manner, apply to the tribunal, and the tribunal

may, after ascertaining that notice of such intention has

been served upon any Superior landlords interested and

after giving such persons an opportunity of being

heard, if satisfied that the improvement—

(a) is of such a nature as to be calculated to add

to the letting value of the holding at the

termination of the tenancy; and

(b) is reasonable and suitable to the character

thereof: and

' •

(c) will not diminish the value of any other property

belonging to the same landlord, or to any

superior landlord from whom the immediate landlord of the tenant directly or indirectly holds;

and after making such modifications (if any) in the

specification or plan as the tribunal thinks fit, or imposing such other conditions as the tribunal may think

reasonable, certify in the prescribed maimer that the

improvement is a proper improvement:

Provided that, if the landlord proves that he has

offered to execute the improvement himself in consideration of a reasonable increase of rent, or of such

increase of rent as the tribunal may determine, the

tribunal shall not give a certificate under this section

unless it is subsequently shown to the satisfaction of the tribunal that the landlord has failed to carry out his

undertaking.

(2) In considering whether the improvement is

reasonable and suitable to the character of the holding,

the tribunal shall have regard to any evidence brought

before it by the landlord or any superior landlord

(but not any other person) that the improvement is

1927. Landlord and Tenant Ch. 36. 435

Act, 1927.

calculated to injure the amenity or convenience of the

neighbourhood.

(3) The tenant shall, at the request of any superior

landlord or at the request of the tribunal, supply such

copies of the plans and specifications of the proposed

improvement as may be required.

(4) Where no such notice of objection as aforesaid

to a proposed improvement has been served within the

time allowed by this section, or where the tribunal has

certified an improvement to be a proper improvement,

it shall be lawful for the tenant as against the immediate and any superior landlord to execute the improvement according to the plan and specification served on

the landlord, or according to such plan and specification

as modified by the tribunal or by agreement between the

tenant and the landlord or landlords affected, anything in

any lease of the premises to the contrary notwithstanding:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall authorise a tenant to execute an improvement in contravention

of any restriction created or imposed—

(a) for naval, military or air force purposes;

(b) for civil aviation purposes under the powers of the Air Navigation Act, 1920; 10 & 11

(c) for securing any rights of the public over the Geo - 5 - c - 80

foreshore or bed of the sea.

(5) A tenant shall not be entitled to claim compensation under this Part of this Act in respect of any

improvement unless he has, or his predecessors in title

have, served notice of the proposal to make the improvement under this section, and (in case the landlord has

served notice of objection thereto) the improvement has

been certified by the tribunal to be a proper improvement and the tenant has complied with the conditions,

if any, imposed by the tribunal, nor unless the improvement is completed within such time after the service on

the landlord of the notice of the proposed improvement

as may be agreed between the tenant and the landlord

or may be fixed by the tribunal, and where proceedings

have been taken before the tribunal, the tribunal may

defer making any order as to costs until the expiration of the time so fixed for the completion of the improvement.

(6) Where a tenant has executed an improvement

of which he has served notice in accordance with this

436 Ch. 36. Landlord and Tenant 17 & 18 Geo. 5.

Act, 1927.

section and with respect to which either no notice of

objection has been served by the landlord or a certificate

that it is a proper improvement has been obtained from

the tribunal, the tenant may require the landlord to

furnish to him a certificate that the improvement has

been duly executed; and if the landlord refuses or fails

within one month after the service of the requisition to

do so, the tenant may apply to the tribunal who, if

satisfied that the improvement has been duly executed,

shall give a certificate to that effect.

Where the landlord furnishes such a certificate, the

tenant shall be liable to pay any reasonable expenses

incurred for the purpose by the landlord, and if any

question arises as to the reasonableness of such expenses,

it shall be determined by the tribunal.

Compensa- 4.—(1) The tenant of a holding to which this Part of

tion for this Act applies shall, if a claim for the purpose is made

goodwill. i n the prescribed manner—

(i) in the case of a tenancy terminated by notice,

within one month after the service of the notice

on the tenant; and

(ii) in any other ease, not more than thirty-six nor

less than twelve months before the termination

of the tenancy;

be entitled, at the termination of the tenancy on quitting

the holding, to be paid by his landlord compensation for

goodwill if he proves to the satisfaction of the tribunal

that by reason of the carrying on by him or his predecessors in title at the premises of a trade or business

for a period of not less than five years goodwill has

become attached to the premises by reason whereof the

premises could be let at a higher rent than they would

have realised had no such goodwill attached thereto:

Provided that—

(a) the sum to be awarded as compensation for

such goodwill shall not exceed such addition

to the value of the holding at the termination

of the tenancy as may be determined to be

the direct result of the carrying on of the

trade or business by the tenant or his predecessors in title, and in determining such

addition the tribunal shall, if it is proved that

the premises will be demolished wholly or

partially, or used for a different and more

profitable purpose, have regard to the effect

of such demolition or change of user on the

value of the goodwill to the landlord;

(b) the tenant shall not be entitled to compensation in respect of such goodwill if within

two months after the making of the claim

the landlord serves on the tenant notice that

he is willing and able to grant to the tenant,

or obtain the grant to him of a renewal of,

the tenancy of the premises at which the

trade or business is carried on at such rent

and for such term not exceeding fourteen

years as, failing agreement, the tribunal may

consider reasonable; and if the tenant does

not witlfin one month from the service of the

notice send to the landlord an acceptance in

writing of the offer the tenant shall be deemed

to have declined the offer;

(c) in the case of licensed premises the sum payable

as compensation for goodwill under this

section shall not include any addition to

the value of the premises attributable to the

fact that the premises are licensed premises;

(d) the tribunal shall, in determining the amount

of compensation for goodwill—

(i) have regard to the intentions of the

tenant as to carrying on the trade or

business elsewhere, and may make it a

condition of its award that the tenant

shall undertake not to carry on the trade

or business within such distance of the

premises as may be specified in the award;

and

(ii) disregard any value which is attributable exclusively to the situation of the

premises;

(e) where the landlord proves that the value of the goodwill has been created or increased

owing to restrictions imposed by the landlord, whether by agreement with the tenant

or not, upon the letting for a competitive

trade or business of other premises in the

neighbourhood owned by or under the control

of the landlord, the tribunal shall have regard

thereto and may refuse the application for

compensation or may award a reduced amount

of compensation;

(f) compensation under this section shall not

be payable if the tenant has determined

the tenancy or failed to exercise an option

for a further term contained in the lease or

in a collateral agreement, unless, in the case

would be entitled to compensation under the last foregoing section, the sum which could be awarded to him

under that section would not compensate him for the

loss of goodwill he will suffer if he removes to and

carries on his trade or business in other premises, he may

in lieu of claiming such compensation, at any time

within the period allowed for making a claim under

the said section, serve on the landlord notice requiring

a new lease of the premises at which the trade or business

(2) Where such a notice is so served, the tribunal, on

application being made for the purpose either by the

landlord or by the tenant not less than nine months

before the termination of the tenancy, or, where the

rent payable under the new tenancy shall be such rent

as the tribunal may determine to be the rent which

premises, having regard to the terms of the tenancy,

but irrespective of any goodwill which may have become

attached to the premises by reason of the tenant or his

predecessors in title having carried on thereat a particular

trade or business.

consistent with good estate management, and

for this purpose regard shall be had to the

development of any other property of the

same landlord:

Provided that, if the grant of a new lease is refused by

the tribunal on any such ground as is mentioned in

paragraph (6), the tribunal may make it a condition of

refusal that if the landlord fails to carry out his intention

within such period as may be allowed by the tribunal,

the landlord shall pay to the tenant such compensation

as the tribunal may fix not exceeding the amount of the

loss which the tenant has suffered by reason of having

been deprived of his right to the grant of a new lease

under this section.

of the tribunal that the premises, though not required

immediately on any such ground as aforesaid, will be so

required after the lapse of a certain period, the term for

which the lease is granted shall not extend beyond the

expiration of that period, unless the lease is made subject

to a condition that the landlord may at any time after

the expiration of that period, on giving not less than

sixj'months’ notice in waiting, resume possession of the

that the premises are so required, and on giving not

utility company and it is proved to the satisfaction of the tribunal that the premises, though not required

immediately for the purposes of the department or of

any other Government department or of the authority

or of the undertaking of the company, may be so required

at some future time, the tribunal shall not order the

grant of a lease unless the lease is made subject to a

condition that the landlord may at any time on giving

not less than six months’ notice in writing resume possession of the premises if he requires them for any such

purpose.

adequate; and the consideration may as to the whole or

any part thereof, if the tribunal so determines, be in the

form of a terminable rent charge for such amount and of

such duration not exceeding the duration of the landlord’s interest as the tribunal may fix.

arise in respect of goodwill attaching to the premises and

attributable to the trade or business carried on thereat

during the term of a new lease granted in pursuance of this section, or of a renewal of a lease granted in lieu of

compensation under the last foregoing section; without

prejudice however to the right to make a claim for

landlord he .shall be liable to pay to the tenant compensation for any loss the tenant may suffer in consequence

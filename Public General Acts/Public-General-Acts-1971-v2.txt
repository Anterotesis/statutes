917

(3) Where, under a contract made or varied (whether by agreement or under a power contained in the contract) on or after the said 27th October, a person incurs expenditure as respects which the Secretary of State is satisfied that it is in respect of the supply to that person of works, goods or services in substitution for works, goods or services of the same or a substantially similar description which were to have been supplied to him or, if he is a member of a group, to any other member of that group under a contract made before that date, subsection

(1) above shall not prevent the making to that person of a grant under the said Part I in respect of so much of that expenditure as does not exceed the expenditure which he or, as the case may be, the other member of the group would have incurred in respect of the supply of the last-mentioned works, goods or services.

(4) Where a person was on 26th October 1970 entitled to the benefit of a contract for the construction of a new ship, subsection (1) above shall not prevent the making of a grant under the said Part I in respect of expenditure incurred by that person or, if he is a member of a group, by any other member of the group in the provision of the ship, or of any ship appearing to the Secretary of State to be of the same or a substantially similar description thereto and supplied in substitution therefor, so far as that expenditure either consists of a sum or sums falling due under a contract made before the said 27th October or is in respect of goods or services supplied on or before the date on which the ship is delivered.

An order under this subsection shall be made by statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.

(7) This section shall be construed as one with the said Part I; and for the purposes of this section, a group consists of a body corporate together with all other bodies corporate which are its subsidiaries within the meaning of section 154 of the Companies Act 1948.

(8) The following provisions of the said Act of 1966 are hereby repealed—

subsections (1)(6) and (2) of section 7 (power to specify further assets eligible for grant), section 11 (advisory committees), and section 12 (annual reports).

Provided that the grant may be of an amount less than that proportion in any case where it appears to the Secretary of State that the employment likely to be provided as a result of the expenditure so incurred and any associated expenditure does not justify a grant equal to the appropriate proportion.

(2) The appropriate proportion for this purpose is—

(< a) twenty-five per cent, of the relevant expenditure in the case of a building or extension in an intermediate area; and

(b) subject to subsection (7) below, thirty-five per cent, of the relevant expenditure in the case of a building or extension in a development area,

plus, in either case, a further ten per cent, of the relevant expenditure, where it appears to the Secretary of State that the application for the grant is made for the purpose of setting up an undertaking in the area in circumstances which justify the giving of special assistance under the said section 3.

(3) In the said section 3 and this section, references to buildings include references to structures; and, for the purposes of that section and this, a building may be provided by the adaptation of an existing one, and a building or extension of a building by the purchase of a new one, that is to say, one not previously occupied.

(4) Where a building or extension of a building constructed with a view to being let to another person includes special features at the request of that person, and he is required to pay a capital sum in consideration thereof, the said section 3 and this section shall have effect as if that sum were expenditure incurred by him in providing the building or extension.

(5) Where at any time a development area ceases to be such without becoming an intermediate area, or an intermediate area ceases to be such without becoming a development area, it shall be treated as continuing to be a development area or, as the case may be, intermediate area—

(a) for the purpose of enabling grants to be made under the

said section 3 on applications received by the Secretary of State before that time, or in respect of expenditure any part of which was incurred by the applicant under a contract entered into before that time, and

(b) for the purpose of the continued operation of any agree-

ment relating to any grant under the said section 3.

In this subsection and subsection (6) below, references to development areas and intermediate areas include references to parts of development areas and intermediate areas.

(6) Where at any time a development area becomes an intermediate area, it shall be treated as if it were still a development area for the purpose of determining the amount of any grant to be made under the said section 3 on an application received by the Secretary of State before that time, or in respect of expenditure any part of which was incurred by the applicant under a contract entered into before that time; and where at any time an intermediate area becomes a development area, it shall be treated as if it were still an intermediate area for the purpose of determining the amount of a grant under the said section 3 in the following circumstances—

(a) in the case of a grant in respect of the provision of a

building or extension by purchase, if the contract to purchase was entered into before that time, or if before that time any work on providing the building or extension was done on the site with a view to occupation by the applicant for the grant or, if the applicant is a member of a group, by any other member of that group;

(b) in the case of a grant made by virtue of subsection (4)

above, if any work on including the special features in the building or extension was done before that time; and

(c) in the case of any other grant, if any work on providing

the building or extension was done on the site before

that time by or on behalf of the applicant for the grant or, if the applicant is a member of a group, by or on behalf of any other member of that group.

For the purposes of this subsection, a group consists of a body corporate together with all other bodies corporate which are its subsidiaries within the meaning of section 154 of the Companies Act 1948.

(7) In the following circumstances, the percentage in subsection (2)(b) above shall be twenty-five per cent, instead of thirty-five per cent.—

(a) in the case of a grant in respect of the provision of a

building or extension by purchase, if the contract to purchase was entered into before 27th October 1970, or if before that date any work on providing the building or extension was done on the site with a view to occupation by the applicant for the grant or, if the applicant is a member of a group, by any other member of that group;

(b) in the case of a grant made by virtue of subsection (4)

above, if any work on including the special features in the building or extension was done before the said 27th October; and

(c) in the case of any other grant, if any work on providing

the building or extension was done on the site before the said 27th October by or on behalf of the applicant for the grant or, if the applicant is a member of a group, by or on behalf of any other member of that group:

Provided that the Secretary of State may determine that paragraph (c) above shall not have effect in any case the special circumstances of which appear to him to justify such a determination.

In this subsection “ group ” has the same meaning as in subsection (6) above.

(8) This section shall be construed as one with Part I of the Local Employment Act 1960.

(9) The following are hereby repealed, that is to say, section 2 of the Local Employment Act 1963, section 17 of the Industrial Development Act 1966 and, in section 21(4) of that Act, paragraph

(b) and the words “ (b) or ” in paragraph (d), and, in section 1(4) of the Local Employment Act 1970, the words “ 17(1) ”.

(10) The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply in relation to any grant under the said section 3 offered or made before the passing of this Act; but, in the case of any such

Investment and Building Grants Act 1971

c. 51

921

grant in respect of expenditure incurred in relation to a development area, the Secretary of State may if he thinks fit re-determine the amount of the grant as if, in relation to the expenditure in question or that expenditure so far as relating to any particular building or extension, section 2(1) of the said Act of 1963 had prescribed a rate of thirty-five per cent, instead of twenty-five per cent., and section 17(1) of the said Act of 1966 had substituted a rate of forty-five per cent, in the circumstances there mentioned, and may make such revised offer or, as the case may require, additional payment under the said section 3 as is consequential on the re-determination.

3. This Act may be cited as the Investment and Building Grants Short title Act 1971; and section 2 of this Act and the Local Employmentand cltatl0D* Acts 1960 to 1970 may be cited together as the Local Employment Acts 1960 to 1971.

(/) a pension beginning in the six months following 1st October 1970 may be increased by 6 per cent, of the basic rate.

(2) In the case of a pension beginning before the year 1969 the increase authorised by subsection (1)(«) above shaft take the place of those authorised by the Pensions (Increase) Acts 1920 to 1969, but in the cases provided for by section 6 below shall be of the larger amount there specified by reference to increases that might have been made under those Acts.

2.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the Minister for the Civil Service, as soon as may be after 31st March in the year 1973 and every second year thereafter, shall review the rates of official pensions against any rise there may have been in the cost of living during the review period, that is to say, the two years ending with that date; and if it is found that in the review period the cost of living has risen by four per cent, or more, then the Minister shall by order provide that the annual rate of an official pension may, if a qualifying condition is satisfied, be increased in accordance with the order in respect of any period beginning on or after 1st September next following the review period.

(2) Subject to subsection (3) below, the increases to be provided for by an order under this section shall be as follows: —

(a) for pensions beginning on or before the first day of the review period the increase shall be in the proportion (to the nearest one-tenth of one per cent.) in which the cost of living has risen during the review period; and

(b) for pensions beginning in the half year following that day or in any of the succeeding half years up to that ending with the day after the end of the review period, the increases shall be in the proportion (to the nearest one-tenth of one per cent.) in which the cost of living is found to have risen between the basis period for that half year and the end of the review period, if the cost of living in the basis period is taken as the mean of the monthly figures.

For purposes of paragraph ( b)above, the basis period for any half year is the six months ending with the first month of the half year or, if the cost of living is lower in the half year than in those six months, is the half year itself.

(3) Where the rise referred to in subsection (2Kb) above is less for any half year than four per cent., there shall only be an increase for pensions beginning in that half year if there

is one for pensions beginning in a later half year, and the partI increase (if there is one) shall be four per cent.; but where this subsection prevents there being an increase for pensions beginning in any half year, then the order made in respect of the next review period shall for those pensions authorise, instead of an increase calculated in accordance with subsection (2 above, such increase as would result if that prevented by this subsection had been made and were followed by one calculated in accordance with subsection (2) (a)by reference to the rate as so increased.

(4) Where on any review under this section (including a review made by virtue of this subsection) it is not found that the cost of living has risen by four per cent, or more in the review period, then there shall be a further review in the next year for the same review period extended by twelve months; and if on a review made by virtue of this subsection it is found that the cost of living has risen by four per cent, or more in the (extended) review period, the provisions of this section shall apply accordingly, and later reviews shall be made at intervals of two years thereafter until this subsection again applies.

(5) On any review under this section the cost of living shall be assessed by such means as the Minister thinks appropriate.

(6) The increases in the rate of a pension that may be provided for by an order under this section are to be calculated, except as otherwise stated in this Part of this Act, by reference to the basic rate of the pension as authorised to be increased by section 1 above or by any earlier order under this section; but an order under this section may be made so as to incorporate the effect, in whole or in part, of section 1 above or of any earlier order under this section, and may repeal or amend any provision of that section or of any such order accordingly.

(7) An order under this section shall be made by statutory instrument, which shall be laid before Parliament after it is made.

Effect of use partly for trade etc. purposes and partly for other purposes

5.—(1) A first-year allowance may be made to a person in respect of any machinery or plant notwithstanding that it appears that, during the period during which the machinery or plant will be used for the purposes of a trade carried on by him, it will also be used for other purposes; but the allowance in any such case shall be so much only of the allowance that would fall to be made if the machinery or plant were to be used only for the purposes of the trade as may be just and reasonable having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case and, in particular, to the extent to which it appears that the machinery or plant is likely to be used for the said other purposes during that period.

(2) Where any machinery or plant is used partly for the purposes of a trade and partly for other purposes, the following provisions of this paragraph shall have effect with respect to the allowances and charges to be made in the case of the trade (hereafter called “the actual trade ”) under section 44 of this Act.

(3) If the machinery or plant has been used for the purposes of the actual trade at any time before the beginning of the chargeable period or its basis period in which it is first used partly for those purposes and partly for other purposes, it shall be treated for the purposes of the said section 44 as having permanently ceased to be used for the purposes of the actual trade immediately after the beginning of the said chargeable or basis period.

(4) Whether or not sub-paragraph (3) above applies, it shall be assumed for the purposes of the said section 44—

(a) that (with paragraph 7 of this Schedule applying where appropriate) immediately after the beginning of the said chargeable or basis period the machinery or plant is brought into use for the purposes of a trade (hereafter called “the notional trade ”) carried on by the person carrying on the actual trade separately from that and any other trade carried on by him,

( b) that from then until it ceases altogether to be used for the purposes of the actual trade the machinery or plant is used solely for the purposes of the notional trade,

(c) that the notional trade is permanently discontinued on the machinery or plant ceasing altogether to be used for the purposes of the actual trade, and

Finance Act 1971

c. 68

1289

(d) that any first-year allowance made in respect of the machinery or plant was made without any reduction in the amount thereof under sub-paragraph (1) above;

and the allowance or charge under that section which, on the above assumptions and having regard to sub-paragraph (5) below, would fall to be made for any chargeable period in the case of the notional trade—

(i) shall be reduced to such extent as may be just and reasonable

having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case and, in particular, to the extent to which the machinery or plant was used in that chargeable period or its basis period otherwise than for the purposes of the actual trade, and

(ii) shall, as so reduced, be made for that chargeable period in

the case of the actual trade.

(5) If an allowance under the said section 44 falling by virtue of this paragraph to be made for any chargeable period in the case of the actual trade is not claimed, or is reduced in amount in accordance with a requirement under the proviso to subsection (2) of that section, then, in determining the allowance or charge under that section which would fall to be made for any subsequent chargeable period in the case of the notional trade, any allowance falling to be made in the case of that trade for the first-mentioned chargeable period shall be treated as not claimed or, as the case may require, proportionately reduced.

Effect of subsidies towards wear and tear

6.—(1) If it appears that, during the period during which any machinery or plant will be used by a person for the purposes of his trade, sums which—

{a) are in respect of, or take account of, the wear and tear to the machinery or plant occasioned by its use for those purposes, and

(b) do not Call to be taken into account as income of that person, or in computing the profits or gains of any trade carried on by him,

are, or are to be, payable to that person directly or indirectly by the Crown, or by any government or public or local authority (whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere), or by any other person, then, unless those sums are in respect of, or take account of, part only of the said wear and tear, any expenditure incurred by the first-mentioned person in providing the machinery or plant shall be wholly disregarded for the purposes of Chapter I of Part III of this Act.

(2) Where sub-paragraph (1) above would apply to a person’s expenditure on the provision of machinery or plant but for the fact that the sums there referred to are in respect of, or take account of, part only of the wear and tear to the machinery or plant, a first-year allowance may be made in respect of the expenditure, but the amount thereof shall be reduced to such extent as may be just

Sch. 8

1290

c. 68

Finance Act 1971

Sch. 8 and reasonable having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case.

(3) Where sums within sub-paragraph (1) above are paid as mentioned in that sub-paragraph to a person carrying on a trade, but are in respect of, or take account of, part only of the wear and tear to the machinery or plant in respect of which they are paid, the following provisions of this paragraph shall have effect with respect to the allowances and charges to be made in the case of the trade (hereafter called “ the actual trade ”) under section 44 of this Act

(4) If the machinery or plant has been used for the purposes of the actual trade at any time before the beginning of the chargeable period or its basis period in which the first such sum is so paid in respect thereof, it shall be treated for the purposes of the said section 44 as having permanently ceased to be used for the purposes of the actual trade immediately after the beginning of the said chargeable or basis period.

(5) Whether or not sub-paragraph (4) above applies, it shall be assumed for the purposes of the said section 44—

(a) that (with paragraph 7 of this Schedule applying where

appropriate) immediately after the beginning of the said chargeable or basis period the machinery or plant is brought into use for the purposes of a trade (hereafter called “the notional trade*) carried on by the person carrying on the actual trade separately from that and any other trade carried on by him,

(b) that from then until it ceases altogether to be used for the

purposes of the actual trade the machinery or plant is used solely for the purposes of the notional trade, with no sums within sub-paragraph (1) above being paid in respect thereof to the person carrying on that trade,

(c) that the notional trade is permanently discontinued on the

machinery or plant ceasing altogether to be used for the purposes of the actual trade, and

(il) that any first-year allowance made in respect of the machinery or plant was made without any reduction in the amount thereof under sub-paragraph (2) above;

and the allowance or charge under that section which, on the above assumptions and having regard to sub-paragraph (6) below, would fall to be made for any chargeable period in the case of the notional trade—

(i) shall be reduced to such extent as may be just and reasonable

having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case, and

(ii) shall, as so reduced, be made for that chargeable period in the case of the actual trade.

(6) If an allowance under the said section 44 falling by virtue of this paragraph to be made for any chargeable period in the

Finance Act 1971

c. 68

1291

case of the actual trade is not claimed, or is reduced in amount in accordance with a requirement under the proviso to subsection (2) of that section, then, in determining the allowance or charge under that section which would fall to be made for any subsequent charge* able period in the case of the notional trade, any allowance falling to be made in the case of that trade for the first-mentioned chargeable period shall be treated as not claimed or, as the case may require, proportionately reduced.

Effect of use after user not attracting capital allowances, or after receipt by way of gift

7.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2) below, where a person—

(a) brings into use for the purposes of a trade carried on by

him machinery or plant which belongs to him in consequence of his having incurred capital expenditure on its provision, but which he has previously used in circumstances such that that expenditure has not been taken into account in computing any allowance falling to be made in the case of the trade under Chapter 1 of Part III of this Act, or

(b) brings into use for the purposes of a trade carried on by him machinery or plant which belongs to him in consequence of a disposition by way of gift by reason of which the donor was required by virtue of section 44(5) of this Act to bring into account for the purposes there mentioned a disposal value equal to the price which the machinery or plant would have fetched if sold in the open market at the time of the gift,

the said section 44 shall have effect as if that person had incurred capital expenditure on the provision of the machinery or plant for the purposes of the trade in the chargeable period related to its bringing into use for those purposes, the amount of that expenditure being taken as the price which the machinery or plant would have fetched if sold in the open market on the date when it was so brought into use, and the machinery or plant being treated as belonging to that person in consequence of his having incurred that expenditure.

(2) Sub-paragraph (1) above shall not apply where a person brings into use for the purposes of a trade carried on by him machinery or plant which belongs to him in consequence of his having incurred capital expenditure on its provision and which he has previously used only for the purposes of activities carried on by him before commencing to work a mine, oil well, or other source of mineral deposits of a wasting nature, being activities consisting of—

(a) searching for or discovering and testing deposits or winning

access thereto, or

(b) the construction of any works which are likely to be of little or no value when the source is no longer worked, or, where the source is worked under a foreign concession, which are

Sch. 8

1292

c. 68

Finance Act 1971

Sch. 8

likely to become valueless when the concession comes to an end to the person working the source immediately before the concession comes to an end ;

but, in any such case, the actual expenditure incurred by that person on the provision of the machinery or plant shall be treated for the purposes of the said section 44 as having been incurred by him on its provision for the purposes of the trade in the chargeable period related to its bringing into use for those purposes.

In this sub-paragraph—

“foreign concession* means a right or privilege granted by the government of, or any municipality or other authority in, any territory outside the United Kingdom, and “mineral deposits* includes any natural deposits capable of being lifted or extracted from the earth.

Special rules for new ships

(2) Where a notice has been given under sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any first-year allowance—

(a) the allowance shall, as the case may require, be withheld or withdrawn, or partially withheld or withdrawn, and

(b) the expenditure to which the allowance relates shall be disregarded for all the purposes of section 44 of this Act except the purposes of subsections (5) and (6) of that section, and

(c) the person giving the notice may claim the amount with-

held or withdrawn as a first-year allowance for any subsequent chargeable period in which he carries on the trade, or may claim first-year allowances not exceeding that amount in the aggregate for any two or more such periods.

(3) All such assessments and adjustments of assessments shall be made as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of this paragraph.

(4) An allowance which is postponed by virtue of this paragraph shall not by reason only of the postponement fall within the references to allowances or amounts carried forward from an earlier year or period in sections 169(4 )(d), 174(6) and 259(2) of the Taxes Act (loss relief and group relief).

Special rules for motor cars

9. In paragraphs 10 to 12 below “ motor car ” means any mechanic-ally-propelled road vehicle other than one within paragraph ( ), (b) or (c) of section 43 of this Act

Finance Act

c. 68

1293

10.—(1) The following provisions of this paragraph shall have Sch. 8 effect where capital expenditure exceeding £4,000 is incurred, or is treated under any provision of this Schedule as incurred, on the provision of a motor car for the purposes of a trade.

(2) It shall be assumed for the purposes of section 44 of this Act—

(a) that, immediately after the beginning of the chargeable period related to the incurring of the expenditure, the person carrying on the trade (hereafter called “ the actual trade ”) brings the motor car into use for the purposes of a trade carried on by him separately from the actual trade and any other trade he may carry on,

(b) that the motor car is used for the purposes of the separate trade from then until it ceases altogether to be used for the purposes of the actual trade, and

(c) that the separate trade is permanently discontinued when

the motor car ceases altogether to be used for the purposes of the actual trade; and, subject to sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) below, the allowance or charge under that section which, on these assumptions, would fall to be made for any chargeable period in the case of the separate trade shall be made for that period in the case of the actual trade.

(3) If on the assumptions in sub-paragraph (2) above a writing-down allowance would fall to be made for any chargeable period in the case of the separate trade, the amount thereof shall be treated as not exceeding—

(a) except in a case falling within paragraph (b) below, £1,000

or, if the period is part only of a year, a proportionate part of £1,000,

(b) if (by virtue of section 84 of the Capital Allowances Act 1968 c. 3

1968 as applied by this Schedule) the person carrying on the trade is regarded as having incurred a part only of the expenditure actually incurred on the provision of the motor car, a proportionate part of £1,000 or, if the period is part only of a year, that proportionate part proportionately reduced.

(4) Where the motor car ceases to be used for the purposes of the actual trade by reason of a transaction to which paragraph 3 of this Schedule applies—

(a) the disposal value to be brought into account under section 44 of this Act in the case of the separate trade shall be an amount equal to the price which the motor car would have fetched on a sale at the same time in the open market or, if less, the capital expenditure incurred, or treated as incurred, on the provision of the motor car by the person disposing of it, and

(b) the person acquiring the motor car shall be treated for the purposes of Chapter I of Part III of this Act as having incurred on its provision capital expenditure equal to that disposal value.

1294

c. 68

Finance Act 1971

Sch. 8 (5) If either of the following events occurs in relation to the

motor car—

(a) it is used partly for the purposes of the actual trade and

partly for other purposes, or

(b) while it is in use for the purposes of the actual trade, there is paid to the person carrying on the trade any sum which is in respect of, or takes account of, part of the wear and tear to it occasioned by that use,

neither paragraph 5 nor paragraph 6 of this Schedule shall apply, but, for the chargeable period related to the event and any subsequent period, instead of there being made in the case of the actual trade the allowance or charge which under the preceding provisions of this paragraph would fall to be made for that period in the case of the separate trade, there shall be made so much of that allowance or charge as. in accordance with the said paragraph 5 or 6, would be just and reasonable if it were one falling to be made for that period in the case of the notional trade referred to in that paragraph.

11. Where capital expenditure exceeding £4,000 is incurred on the provision of a motor car and, by virtue of section 85 of the

1968 c. 3. Capital Allowances Act 1968 as applied by this Schedule, writing-down allowances may be made to a person as if a contribution made by him to the expenditure had been expenditure on the provision of the motor car for the purposes of a trade, the amount of the allowance to be made for any chargeable period—

(i a) shall be determined as if the contribution had been expenditure on the provision of the motor car for the purposes of a trade carried on by that person separately from any other trade carried on by him, and

(b) shall not exceed an amount bearing to £1,000 the same proportion as that borne by the contribution to the capital expenditure actually incurred on the provision of the motor car or, if the chargeable period is part only of a year, that amount proportionately reduced.

12. Where, apart from this paragraph, the amount of any expenditure on the hiring of a motor car the retail price of which when new exceeds £4.000 would be allowed to be deducted in computing for the purposes of tax the profits or gains of any trade, the said amount shall be reduced in the proportion which £4,000, together with one half of the excess, bears to the said retail price.

Effect of successions to trades between connected persons

13. Where a person (the “ successor ”) succeeds to a trade which was until that time carried on by another person (the “ predecessor ”) and the two persons are connected with each other within the terms of section 533 of the Taxes Act, those persons may by notice in writing to the inspector elect that the provisions of this paragraph shall have effect; and in that event—

(a) for the purpose of making allowances and charges under Chapter 1 of Part III of this Act, the trade shall not be treated as discontinued :


Finance Act 1971

c. 68

1295

(b) allowances and charges shall be so made to or on the sue* cessor as if everything done to or by the predecessor had been done to or by the successor, but with no account being taken of the sale or transfer from the predecessor to the successor of any machinery or plant which was in use for the purposes of the trade at the time of the succession.

Treatment of demolition costs

14.—(1) Where any machinery or plant which is in use for the purposes of a trade is demolished, then—

(a) if the person carrying on the trade replaces the machinery

or plant by other machinery or plant, the net cost to him of the demolition shall be treated for the purposes of Chapter I of Part III of this Act as expenditure incurred by him on the provision of that other machinery or plant, and

(b) if the person carrying on the trade does not replace the machinery or plant, his qualifying expenditure, for the chargeable period related to the demolition shall be treated for the purposes of section 44 of this Act as increased by the net cost to him of the demolition.

(2) In this paragraph any reference to the net cost of the demolition of any machinery or plant is a reference to the excess, if any, of the cost of the demolition over any moneys received for the remains of the machinery or plant.

Application of certain provisions of Capital Allowances Act 1968

15.—<1) Section 44 of the Capital Allowances Act 1968 (partnership using property of a partner) shall have effect as if the reference in subsection (1) to Chapter II of Part 1 of that Act included a reference to Chapter I of Part HI of this Act, and as if the references in subsection (2) to section 33 of that Act and an event giving rise to a balancing allowance or balancing charge included references respectively to section 44(5) of this Act and an event requiring any disposal value to be brought into account.

2.—(1) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State, before the end of the period of one year beginning with the passing of this Act, to prepare in draft a code of practice, containing such practical guidance as in the opinion of the Secretary of State would be helpful for the purpose specified in section 1(1) of this Act.

(2) In preparing that code the Secretary of State shall have regard to—

(a) the need for those who manage undertakings to accept

the primary responsibility for the promotion of good industrial relations, and

(b) the need for providing practical guidance with respect

4. A failure on the part of any person to observe any provi- Use of code ot sion of a code of practice which is for the time being in force practice in under this Part of this Act shall not of itself render him liable pr?cc?u°8\ to any proceedings; but in any proceedings before the Industrial un er 18 c Court or an industrial tribunal under this Act—

c. 72

1345

(2) Any worker who. on application to an employer, has been refused engagement, and who claims that the refusal was attributable (wholly or in part) to a provision in an agreement which had the effect of precluding the employer as mentioned in paragraph ia) or paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section may apply to die Industrial Court for an order under the next following subsection.

(3) If on such an application the Industrial Court finds—

(5) In the case of a person who, on the date on which an agency shop agreement takes effect, is a worker to whom the agreement applies, the agreement shall not require him to pay any such contribution as is mentioned in this section in respect of any period beginning earlier than three months from that date; and, in the case of a person who on that date is not a worker to whom the agreement applies, but subsequently becomes such a worker, the agreement shall not require him to pay any such contribution in respect of any period beginning earlier than one month from the date on which his employment as such a worker begins.

(6) The Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument provide that, in so far as any agency shop agreement relates to workers engaged, or seeking to be engaged, in work of a description specified in die order, subsection

(2) If the trade union agrees to the proposal, and the amount of the contributions, and the charity to which they are to be paid, are agreed between the worker and the trade union, the contributions so agreed shall be taken to be the equivalent contributions for the purposes of this Act

(a) regulating the terms and conditions of employment of

workers of one or more descriptions;

(b) determining, in relation to workers of one or more descriptions, any matters for which a procedure agreement can provide.

(2) The following presumptions shall apply to any proceedings of a joint body to which this section applies, where those proceedings take place after the commencement of this Act.

(3) For the purposes of any such proceedings it shall be conclusively presumed that the parties (whether organisations of workers, employers or organisations of employers) for the time being represented on that joint body (in this section referred to as “ the constituent parties ”) intend to authorise it, in relation to matters falling within the scope of its functions, to make decisions having effect as legally enforceable contracts made on behalf of the constituent parties.

(4) Any decision made by any such body in any such proceedings, in relation to matters falling within the scope of its functions, if the decision—

(a)is duly recorded in writing by or on behalf of that body, and

(b) as so recorded, does not contain a provision which (however expressed) states that the decision is intended not to be legally enforceable,

shall be conclusively presumed to be intended by that body to have effect as a legally enforceable contract made on behalf of the constituent parties.

(5) In this section “ decision ” includes any award or resolution, by whatever name called, and “functions”, in relation to a decision of a joint body established by or under a collective agreement, means its functions under that agreement as it has effect at the time of that decision.

36,—(1) It shall be an unfair industrial practice for any party to a collective agreement—

<a) where the agreement is a legally enforceable contract, to break the agreement, or

(b) where part (but not the whole) of the agreement is a legally enforceable contract, to break that part of the agreement.

(2) Where a collective agreement made after the commence- Part hi ment of this Act, or part of such a collective agreement, is a

legally enforceable contract, it shall be an unfair industrial practice for any party to the agreement not to take all such steps as are reasonably practicable for the purposes—

(a) of preventing persons acting or purporting to act on behalf of that party from taking any action contrary to an undertaking given by that party and contained in the collective agreement or in that part of the agreement, as the case may be;

<b)where the party in question is an organisation, of preventing members of the organisation from taking any such action; and

(c) where any action has been taken as mentioned in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this subsection, of securing that the action is not continued and that further action as mentioned in those paragraphs does not occur.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (2) of this section action taken by a person other than the party who gave the undertaking in question (in this subsection referred to as “the contracting party ”) shall be regarded as action taken contrary to the undertaking if either—

(a) it is action which, if taken by the contracting party,

would have been a breach of the undertaking by the contracting party, or

(b) it consists in doing that which, in accordance with the

undertaking, was not to be done, or in not doing that which, in accordance with the undertaking, was to be done.

unit of employment, other than the Secretary of State, are the employer and—

(a) any trade union which the employer recognises as

having negotiating rights in relation to that unit, and

(b) where a procedure agreement is in existence which

applies to that unit, any trade union (not falling within the preceding paragraph) which is a party to that agreement.

(3) Before the Secretary of State makes an application under this section with respect to a unit of employment, he shall consult the parties appearing to him, in relation to that unit, to be the parties to whom this section applies.

(b) nothing in the preceding paragraph shall prevent the party giving the notice from making an application under this section at any time after the notice has been given.

(5) Subject to the last preceding subsection, if on an application under this section it appears to the Industrial Court that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the unit of employment to which the application relates suffers from one or both of the defects specified in subsection (1) of this section and that, by reason of its doing so,—

(a) the development or maintenance of orderly industrial

relations in that unit has been seriously impeded, or

(b) there have been substantial and repeated losses of

working time in that unit, the Court shall refer to the Commission the question whether the unit does suffer from one or both of those defects and, if so, what remedy (if any) in accordance with the provisions of section 40 of this Act is to be recommended

(2) If, at any time after such a reference has been made and before the Commission have reported on it, it appears to the Commission that, with a view to promoting a satisfactory and lasting settlement of the questions in issue, it is necessary or expedient to extend the scope of the reference, the Commission, subject to the next following subsection, may formulate proposals for extending it; and, where the Commission have formulated any such proposals, they shall—

(2) The Commission shall transmit any such report to the Industrial Court, and shall furnish copies of it—

{a) to the Secretary of State;

(b) to the employer (or, if more than one, each employer) comprised in the reference, either as originally made or as extended; and

(c) to every trade union or other organisation of workers appearing to the Commission to be directly concerned in the questions specified in the reference,

(3) For the purpose of determining, with respect to any group of employees, what recommendation to make in a report under this section on the question specified in section 45(1 Ha) of this Act, the Commission shall consider the extent to which different descriptions of employees in that group have interests in common, having regard in particular, in relation to each such description of employees, to—

and

(б) their training, experience and professional or other

qualifications.

(4) A report of the Commission under this section shall not recommend the recognition of an organisation of workers or joint negotiating panel as sole bargaining agent for a bargaining unit unless it appears to the Commission—

(a) that the organisation, or (in the case of a joint negotiating panel) every organisation represented on it, is an independent organisation of workers;

(b) that its recognition as sole bargaining agent for that bargaining unit would be in accordance with the general wishes of the employees comprised in that bargaining unit, and would promote a satisfactory and lasting settlement of the questions in issue in the reference.

(5) Without prejudice to subsection (4) of this section, the Commission, in determining whether to make such a recommendation in a report under this section, shall in particular consider—

(a) whether the organisation or panel in question has or would have the support of a substantial proportion of the employees comprised in the bargaining unit, and

Part III

1378

c. 72

Part III

(b) whether it has or would have such resources, and is or would be so organised, as to enable it effectively to represent those employees.

(6) Where it appears to the Commission that a joint negotiating panel ought to be formed in relation to a bargaining unit, the Commission, before recommending any organisation of workers for inclusion among those to be represented on the panel, shall in particular consider whether—

(a) it has or would have the support of a substantial

proportion of the employees comprised in that bargaining unit, or of a substantial proportion of the employees of one or more descriptions comprised in that unit, and

(b) it has or would have such resources, and is or would

be so organised, as to enable it to participate effectively in the work of the panel.

(7) Any recommendation contained in such a report may be made subject to such conditions as the Commission think fit; and in particular (but without prejudice to the generality of this subsection) any such condition—

(a) may require an organisation of workers recommended

for recognition as sole bargaining agent for a bargaining unit, or for inclusion in a joint negotiating panel so recommended, to make sufficient trained officials available for purposes of collective bargaining, or

(b) may require any organisation of workers so recom-

mended to undertake not to make or pursue any claim to be recognised as sole bargaining agent for any other bargaining unit consisting (wholly or in part) of employees of any employer to whom the recommendation relates.

(8) Where the Commission determine, in making a report under this section, to recommend the recognition of an organisation of workers or joint negotiation panel as sole bargaining agent for a bargaining unit, and it appears to the Commission that there are in existence more extensive bargaining arrangements which will be applicable to the employees comprised or to be comprised in that bargaining unit, the recommendation—

(a) may specify the more extensive bargaining arrangements

in question, and

(b) may be made subject to the reservation that the organi-

sation or panel, at any time when it is recognised as sole bargaining agent in pursuance of the recommendation, shall not have exclusive negotiating rights in respect of matters which are at that time being dealt

(a) the employer (or, if more than one, any of the em-

ployers), or

(b) subject to the next following subsection, the organisa-

tion of workers or joint negotiating panel, as the case may be,

may make an application to the Industrial Court under this section.

(2) No application under this section shall be made—

(a) in respect of a recommendation relating to an organisa-

tion of workers, unless at the time of the application it is a trade union, or

(b) in respect of a recommendation relating to a joint

negotiating panel, unless at that time it is a joint negotiating panel of trade unions.

(3) If, on any such application, the Industrial Court is satisfied that the recommendation of the Commission was unconditional, or that any conditions subject to which it was made have been sufficiently complied with, the Court shall request the Commission to make arrangements for a ballot of employees comprised in the bargaining unit to be taken on the question whether the recommendation should be made binding.

(4) For the purpose of complying with any such request of the Industrial Court, the Commission shall determine whether the ballot is to be taken by the Commission or is to be taken under the supervision of the Commission by some other body, and in either case what arrangements would best secure that the ballot is properly conducted and that the voting in the ballot will be kept secret, and shall arrange for the ballot to be taken accordingly.

(5) The Commission shall secure that the ballot is not taken until such period as in their opinion is adequate has elapsed since the publication of the report under section 48 of this Act.

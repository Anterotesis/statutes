when exported from the United Kingdom; and

(b) are goods of the same country, and consigned from the

same place, as the goods in question are.

(3) Where the rate at which import duty is chargeable on the goods is such that (apart from this section) the duty chargeable or part of it would be the higher, or the lower, of two amounts, one calculated by reference to value and one by reference to quantity, then the duty chargeable or that part of it shall be determined under the foregoing subsections by reference to value only and without regard to the provision for charging a greater or less amount by reference to quantity; and where that rate is such that part of the duty is to be calculated by reference to value and part

(5) Except as may be provided by order made by the Treasury on the recommendation of the Board of Trade, the foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply on the importation of any goods unless (apart from those provisions) the goods in question would be chargeable with import duty at the same rate as the like goods referred to in subsection (2) of this section, or would be chargeable with the same or a less amount of duty than if chargeable at the rate applicable to those like goods; and where those provisions apply by virtue of an order under this subsection, they shall apply with such modifications (if any) as may be provided by the order as regards the amount by which the duty is to be reduced.

(6) For the purpose of determining whether any goods would have been exempted from import duties as mentioned in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of this section under section thirty-six of the Customs and Excise Act, 1952, any duty of customs chargeable on them on a previous importation into the United Kingdom but not required to be paid shall be deemed not to have been chargeable.

of the agricultural product to which the scheme relates produced by them in the area to which the scheme is applicable during some recent period before the scheme is submitted.

(4) Before a substitutional scheme is submitted to the Minister under subsection (1) of this section it shall be published in the prescribed manner to all producers registered under the scheme revoked by it or (where it revokes more schemes than one) to all producers registered under each of them, and if, within the prescribed period after it has been so published to producers registered under a scheme revoked by it, a poll on the question whether it shall be submitted to the Minister is demanded by the prescribed number or the prescribed proportion, as the case may be, of the producers registered under the scheme revoked, the substitutional scheme shall not be submitted to him unless a poll on that question has been taken and the result thereof shows that the requisite majority of those producers has voted in favour of its submission.

In this subsection “ prescribed ” means, in relation to a scheme revoked by a substitutional scheme, prescribed by the scheme revoked.

2.—(1) Before approving a scheme submitted under the foregoing section, the Minister shall cause to be published, in the Gazette and in such other manner as he thinks best for informing persons affected, a notice—

(b) if the scheme is a substitutional scheme, a report showing

that the provisions of subsection (4) of the said section one have been complied with.

(9) A draft of a scheme which, by the terms of the draft, is to apply to Northern Ireland or any part thereof shall not be laid before either House of Parliament under subsection (7) of this section unless each House of the Parliament of Northern Ireland has resolved that it is expedient that a scheme in the terms of the draft should, if approved under the said subsection (7), extend to Northern Ireland.

(10) If the draft of a scheme which, by the terms of the draft, is to be applicable to Northern Ireland or any part thereof has been laid before either House of the Parliament of Northern Ireland and that House has resolved that it is not expedient that the scheme should extend to Northern Ireland, the Minister may thereupon make in the draft of the scheme such modifications as are necessary in order to prevent the scheme applying

to this Act, and

(b) any of the supplementary grants so specified which are

payable in accordance with the provisions of the said

Part III,

reduced, if it is so prescribed, by the product for the area of the authority of a rate of such sum in the pound as may be prescribed.

(3) The general grants payable to any recipient authority shall be paid at such times as the Minister may with the consent of the Treasury determine, and shall be payable in aid of the revenues of the recipient authority generally.

(4) The provisions of Part IV of the First Schedule to this Act shall have effect as to the making of adjustments of general grants and of the aggregate amount thereof in respect of matters specified in the said Part IV.

(5) The matters which under this section and Part III of the First Schedule to this Act are to be prescribed, shall be prescribed by an order made by the Minister with the consent of the Treasury and after consultation with such associations of local authorities as appear to him to be concerned and with any local authority with whom consultation appears to him to be desirable.

(6) Such an order (hereinafter referred to as a “ general grant order ”) shall be laid before the Commons House of Parliament together with a report by the Minister explaining the considerations leading to the provisions of the order, and shall not have effect until approved by a resolution of that House.

(7) General grant orders shall be made in advance for successive periods (hereinafter referred to as “ grant periods ”) of not less than two years, but as respects any matter to be prescribed by a general grant order the order may make different provisions for different years in the grant period.

(b) any probable fluctuation in the demand for the services

giving rise to relevant expenditure, so far as the fluctuation is attributable to circumstances prevailing in England and Wales as a whole which are not under the control of local authorities;

to which, having regard to general economic conditions, it is reasonable to develop those services.

(2) The provision to be made by a general grant order, other than the prescribing of the annual aggregate amount of the general grants, shall be such as to secure, to the best of the information available to the Minister when he makes the order, that the aggregate of the general grants for each year of the grant period shall approximate as nearly as may be to the aggregate lor that year prescribed by the order and adjusted under Part IV of the First Schedule to this Act.

(3) If, when the general grants for any year fall to be paid, it appears to the Minister that their aggregate will exceed or fall short of the aggregate amount prescribed and adjusted as aforesaid, the Minister shall adjust the amount of the grant payable to each recipient authority as nearly as may be in the proportion which the aggregate amount prescribed by the general grant order, adjusted as aforesaid, bears to the amount, as estimated by the Minister, which would be the total of the general grants apart from this subsection.

(4) If it appears to the Minister that during any grant period any unforeseen increase has taken place in the level of prices, costs or remuneration, and that its effect on the cost of providing the services giving rise to relevant expenditure is of such magnitude that it ought not to fall entirely on local authorities, the Minister may by order (made in the like manner and subject to the like provisions as a general grant order) increase the annual aggregate amouiit of the general grants, or vary any other matter prescribed by the general grant order, for such part of that grant period (beginning either before or after the making of the order) as may be specified in the order.

(2) Where the provision of any service giving rise to relevant expenditure is a function of a rating authority in any administrative county, or of a joint board of which the district is wholly or partly comprised in any administrative county, the foregoing subsection shall in relation to that county apply to a failure on the part of the rating authority or joint board to achieve or maintain reasonable standards as it would apply if the failure were that of the county council; but—

of any reduction by virtue of this subsection in the general grant payable to the county council shall be recoverable by that council from the authority in default,

(b) in the case of a failure by a joint board of which the district does not comprise the whole of the county, the amount of any such reduction shall be recoverable by the county council from the rating authorities in the county whose areas are wholly or partly comprised in the district of the joint board, the amount recoverable being apportioned among the rating authorities of the areas or parts of areas so comprised in proportion to the aggregates of the rateable values shown in the valuation lists respectively in force for those areas or parts of areas on the first day of the year for which the general grant is payable,

and any sum recoverable by virtue of this subsection shall be recoverable by adjustment of the amount due under the county precept.

ASSESSED

1. For any year, the rateable value of the hereditament which an Electricity Board is to be treated as occupying in any rating area as mentioned in subsection (1) of section twelve of this Act shall be the value of the distribution activities of the Board for that area and year, increased, in the case of a Board carrying on generating activities in the area, by the value for that area and year of the generating activities of the Board.

2. The value of the said activities for a rating area shall be an apportioned part of the aggregate value of the activities, and the apportionment shall be made—

(a) in the case of distribution activities, by reference to the

aggregate net annual value of the rating area, or so much thereof as is comprised in the area of the Board, and of the area of the Board,

(b) in the case of generating activities, by reference to the generating capacity of the Board in the rating area and the aggregate generating capacity of the Board.

3. —(1) The aggregate value of the generating and of the distribution activities of the Generating Board shall each be taken to be one half of the Board’s basic value for the year (as hereinafter determined).

(2) The aggregate value of the generating activities of an Area Board shall be taken to be an amount which bears to the aggregate value of the generating activities of the Generating Board the same proportion as the aggregate generating capacity of the Area Board bears to the aggregate generating capacity of the Generating Board, and the aggregate value of the distribution activities of an Area Board shall be taken to be the Board’s basic value for the year (as hereinafter determined) reduced, in the case of a Board carrying on generating activities, by the aggregate value of the generating activities.

4. —(1) The basic value of an Electricity Board for any year shall be determined as follows.

(2) As soon as may be after the passing of this Act the Minister shall certify to each Electricity Board the amount which is to be the basic electricity rateable value.

(3) The amount to be certified by the Minister as the basic electricity rateable value shall be the amount estimated by him to represent the amount of the payment in lieu of rates made or to be made for the benefit of local authorities by the Electricity Council under Part V of the Act of 1948 in respect of the year 1958-59,—

(a) multiplied by the fraction of which the numerator is the estimated rateable value for England and Wales for that year and the denominator is the estimated aggregate gross charge to rates for England and Wales for that year, and

(A) reduced by the estimated aggregate net annual values at the beginning of the year 1959-60 of all premises in respect of which the Electricity Council or an Electricity Board will by virtue of Part I of this Act then become liable to be rated,

and adjusted in such manner as appears to the Minister to be proper having regard to any other relevant considerations.

(4) For the year 1959-60 the basic value of an Electricity Board shall be its share of the basic electricity rateable value, that is to say the percentage of that value set out in the following table.

Electricity Board Percentage

5. —(1) “ Fur skin ” includes any skin with fur, hair or wool attached.

Profits Tax (Transitional Provisions)

1.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, where, in the case of a body corporate, society or other body, the rate of dividend for any chargeable accounting period falling between the end of the standard period of that body or society and the beginning of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, is less than the rate of dividend for the standard period, the gross relevant distributions to proprietors of the body or society for that chargeable accounting period shall be deemed to include an additional distribution by way of dividend computed on the amount of the paid up share capital at the end of the period at a rate equal to the difference between those rates.

(2) If in the case of any body or society there is more than one such chargeable accounting period as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, and the rate of dividend is higher for one, and lower for another, of those periods than for the standard period, then the amount or aggregate amount to be added by virtue of that sub-paragraph to the gross relevant distributions for the period or periods for which the rate is lower shall be reduced by the amount or aggregate amount by which the dividends included in the gross relevant distributions for any of the said periods exceed an amount computed on the amount of the paid up share capital at the end of that period at the rate of dividend for the standard period.

accounting period shall not be greater than will amount, with any dividends included in those distributions, to three-fifths of the profits of the body or society for that period, computed without abatement and including franked investment income.

(4) Where a body or society has been charged to tax by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, and for the period between the end of the standard period and the beginning of April, nineteen hundred and sixty (or the time, if earlier, when the body or society ceases to carry on any trade or business) both the rate of dividend and the rate of earnings are less than for the standard period, there shall be given such relief (if any) by way of repayment of tax as will secure that no more tax is charged by virtue of that sub-paragraph than would have been chargeable if the rate of dividend for the standard period had been the higher of the following rates, namely,—

(a) the rate of dividend for the other period mentioned in this sub-paragraph; and (b) the rate which bears to the rate of dividend for the standard period the same proportion as the rate of earnings for the other period bears to the rate of earnings for the standard period.

(5) Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue that for the standard period of a body or society the dividends included in the gross relevant distributions to proprietors comprised an amount of an exceptional nature, or the rate of dividend was for other special reasons (unrelated to the amount available for distribution) exceptionally high, and that in consequence that rate of dividend is inequitable as a measure of liability to tax under this paragraph, the Commissioners may direct that the rate of dividend of the body or society for the standard period shall be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as reduced to such extent as appears to the Commissioners to be just in the circumstances.

A body or society aggrieved by the decision of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue on an application for a direction under this sub-paragraph may appeal to the Special Commissioners, and all the provisions of the enactments relating to appeals against assessments to the profits tax (including the provisions enabling the Commissioners of Inland Revenue to make regulations) shall have effect with respect to any appeal to the Special Commissioners under this sub-paragraph.

(6) References in this paragraph to the rate of dividend or to the rate of earnings of a body or society for any period shall be taken as referring respectively to the monthly rate relative to the amount of the paid up share capital at the end of the period of the dividends included in the gross relevant distributions to proprietors for the period, and to the monthly rate relative to the said amount of the profits for the period computed without abatement and including franked investment income (any fraction of a month being reckoned in computing either rate as a month):

Provided that—

(a) if the period is not a period for which accounts are made up (in this paragraph refeired to as a “period of account”), the rate shall be the rate or the average of the rates for the period or periods of account in which it is comprised (any

1958

Finance A, 1958

Ch. 56

659

such average being taken according to the number of months or parts of a month at each rate in the period); and

(b) the gross relevant distributions for a period of account which is not a chargeable accounting period shall be computed as if it were.

(7) For the purposes of this paragraph any amount of share capital treated by a body or society as paid up since the end of the standard period in consideration of the retention by the body or society of sums distributable by way of dividend, or in consequence of the application by the body or society to that purpose of any sums, whether distributable or not, shall be disregarded.

(8) For the purposes of this paragraph the standard period of a body or society is its last period of account for which either—

(a) the rate of dividend cannot be affected by virtue of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section thirty-five of the Finance Act, 1947, by any declaration of dividends made on or after the fifteenth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-eight; or

(b) the body or society in general meeting has before the said day finally decided the total amount of the dividends, (if any):

Provided that—

(i) where the length of a period of account is less than that regularly adopted for the preceding periods of account, it shall not be treated as the standard period but shall be disregarded, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue that the length of the period was determined before the said day; and

(ii) where a decision as to dividends is made by a body or society in general meeting after the said day in accordance with a recommendation of the directors, and the directors* decision to make that recommendation was, with their authority, publicly announced before the said day, the decision of the body or society shall be treated for the purposes of this sub-paragraph as made before the said day.

2.—(1) Any notice given by a principal company under subsection

(1) of section twenty-two of the Finance Act, 1937 (which relates to groups of companies), may, at any time within six months of the passing of this Act or such longer time as the Commissioners of Inland Revenue may allow, be revoked by that company by notice in writing to the Commissioners, and a notice given as respects more than one subsidiary may be so revoked as respects any or all of them.

(2) A notice revoked under this paragraph shall not have or be deemed to have had effect for any period after the end of March, nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, in relation to any subsidiary as respects which it is so revoked; but its revocation shall not revive any previous notice.

(3) Any election made by an assurance company under paragraph 5 of Part III of the Eighth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1947, may be revoked under this paragraph within the like time, in the like manner and with the like effect as such a notice as aforesaid.

(4) This paragraph shall not authorise the revocation of any notice given after the passing of this Act, unless the notice has effect for a period beginning before the end of March, nineteen hundred and fifty-eight.

EIGHTH SCHEDULE Estate Duty (Quick Successions)

1. —(1) The net value after the earlier death of any property forming part of the deceased’s estate at his death and transferred to a person specifically entitled thereto shall be taken to be the value on which estate duty was payable on that death, less the amounts payable out of that property in respect of death duties on that death or of liabilities of the deceased or his estate, other than amounts deducted in arriving at that value or met in the course of administration out of or by means of other property passing on the death.

(2) Property paid or appropriated on the earlier death in or towards satisfaction of legacies (other than property forming part of the deceased’s estate at his death and transferred to a person specifically entitled thereto) shall be regarded as being the same as the property passing on the death and not so transferred, and any property so paid or appropriated shall be treated as being of a net value after the death equal to its value at the time when it is paid or appropriated, after allowing for any charge or incumbrance subject to which it is paid or appropriated; and similarly with property distributed on the coming to an end of a settlement (whether on the earlier death or not).

In this sub-paragraph “ legacy ” includes any right conferred by a testamentary disposition or arising by reason of intestacy.

(3) Any sums received on the earlier death under any policy or contract of assurance on the life of the deceased, where sub-paragraph

(2) of this paragraph does not apply, shall be regarded as being the same property as that policy or contract, and to be of a net value after the death equal to the value on which duty is payable on that death, less any death duties payable thereout on that death.

(4) Save as otherwise provided, the net value after the earlier death of any property shall be taken to be the value on which estate duty is payable on that death, less any death duties payable thereout on that death.

2. —(1) Property to which the (second) deceased is at his death or has at any time since the earlier death been beneficially entitled (not being property which is or would apart from this paragraph be regarded as being property on which duty was payable on the earlier death) shall be regarded as being the same property as any sum of money received by him on the earlier death (being a sum which is or is to be regarded as being property on which duty was payable as aforesaid), if and to the extent to which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners that the property can be so regarded on the assumption that the property at any time paid away or otherwise disposed of by the deceased since the earlier death was (as far as might be) property other than that representing the said sum, or, in so far as the property retained by the deceased at his death is not sufficient to represent the said sum, that the sum was applied by him rateably in making any gifts or settlements property comprised in which is chargeable with estate duty on his death.

(2) Where the (second) deceased received on the earlier death property other than a sum of money, and before his death he has

1958

Finance A, 1958

Ch. 56

661

ceased to have possession and enjoyment of it in any circumstances in which he can be regarded as receiving money or money's worth in substitution for it, sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply as if the property received by him on the earlier death had consisted of a sum of money equal to the net value of that property after the earlier death or to the amount or value (at the time when he ceased to have possession and enjoyment of that property) of what he so receives in substitution for that property, whichever is the less.

(3) References in the foregoing sub-paragraphs to a sum of money or other property being received by the deceased on the earlier death include its being received by him under a gift inter vivos in respect of which estate duty was chargeable on the earlier death and to its being received by him on the distribution under a settlement of property in respect of which duty was so chargeable.

(4) The duty to be reduced by relief given by virtue of this paragraph shall be the duty payable on any property comprised in the deceased's estate at his death, or in the gift or settlement, as the case may be, other than property in respect of which relief is given apart from this paragraph, but subject to the limit imposed on the amount of the relief by subsection (2) of section thirty of this Act.

(5) For the purposes of subsection (3) of section thirty of this Act, relief given by virtue of this paragraph shall be treated as given only on a part of the property on which the duty is reduced equal in value to the amount on which relief is given.

3.—(1) The provisions of this paragraph shall have effect where the property chargeable with duty on the later death is or has been settled property.

(2) The property at any time comprised in a settlement shall be regarded as the same property, notwithstanding any substitution of one item for another; and any reference in paragraph ( ) of subsection (1) of section thirty of this Act or in this Schedule to the person entitled to property shall, in the case of settled property, be taken as referring to the persons in whom the property is vested on the trusts of the settlement.

(3) Where there has been a purchase for a consideration in money or money's worth of an interest under the settlement, relief shall not be allowed on the death of a person who acquired his title to the property chargeable (or his interest therein) by or under that purchase, except by reference to the death of another such person, nor be allowed by reference to the death of such a person, except on the death of another such person.

(4) Where on the later death the settled property is chargeable with duty by virtue of section forty-three of the Finance Act, 1940, and the settlement has come to an end before the death as respects any part of that property, then in relation to that part of the property paragraph

of subsection (1) of section thirty of this Act and sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph shall apply as if any reference to a time immediately before the death were a reference to a time immediately before the coming to an end of the settlement as respects that part of the property; and relief shall not be allowed by reference to a death occurring after the end of the settlement, other than the death of the

—com. settlement when it came to an end and did not acquire his title thereto

by or under a purchase for a consideration in money or money's worth made at any time (whether by him or another).

(5) Where relief is allowed in a case to which sub-paragraph (4) of of this paragraph applies by reference to the death of a person receiving property distributed under the settlement, and that property includes (or is treated as including) a sum of money, then—

(a) the property chargeable with duty on the later death shall be

regarded as being the same as any property forming part of the said person's estate or otherwise chargeable with duty on his death to the extent to which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners that that property can be regarded as being the same property as that sum, on the assumption that the property at any time paid away or otherwise disposed of by the said person since the coming to an end of the settlement was (as far as might be) property other than that representing the said sum, or, in so far as the property forming part of his estate is not sufficient to represent the said sum, that the sum was applied by him rateably in making any gifts or settlements the property comprised in which is chargeable with estate duty on his death; and

(b) where the said person has before his death ceased to have possession and enjoyment of any property distributed to him under the settlement other than a sum of money, and has done so in any circumstances in which he can be regaided as receiving money or money's worth in substitution for it, paragraph (a) of this sub-paragraph shall apply as if the property distributed to him had included, instead of that property, a sum of money equal to the amount or value (at the time when he ceases to have possession and enjoyment of that property) of what he so receives in substitution for it.

(6) Where on the later death settled property is chargeable with duty by reason of the coming to an end of an interest limited to cease on the death (or a disposition or determination of such an interest), and relief is allowed either—

(a) by reference to an earlier death on which there passed an interest expectant on or subject to the interest so limited; or

(b) in a case to which sub-paragraph (4) of this paragraph applies,

by reference to the death of a person receiving property distributed under the settlement;

the net value of the relevant property after the earlier death shall be taken to be the value on which estate duty is payable on the earlier death, except that in the case of property referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of sub-paragraph (5) of this paragraph it shall be taken to be the amount of the sum of money there referred to.

4.—(1) The provisions of this paragraph shall have effect where property is chargeable on the later death as property comprised in a gift inter vivos made by the deceased.

(2) Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section thirty of this Act shall apply as if any reference to a time immediately before the death were a reference to the time when the gift is made, but relief shall not be allowed by reference to the death of any person who has acquired his title to the property in question by or under a purchase for a consideration in money or money's worth made since that time (whether by him or by another).

(3) Subject to the following sub-paragraph the property on which duty is chargeable on the later death as property comprised in the gift shall be regarded as being the same as the property originally comprised in the gift.

(4) Where the donee has died before the donor, relief shall not be allowed by reference to any death subsequent to that of the donee, and for the purpose of allowing relief by reference to the death of the donee—

(a) the property chargeable on the later death shall be regarded as being the same as—

(i) the property on which duty would have been so chargeable if the donor had died immediately before the donee; and

(ii) if that property, not being settled property, includes (or is treated as including) a sum of money, any other property forming part of the donee's estate or otherwise chargeable with duty on his death to the extent to which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners that that property can be regarded as property comprised in the gift on the assumption that the property at any time paid away or otherwise disposed of by the donee since the gift was (as far as might be) property other than that representing the property so comprised, or, in so far as the property forming part of the donee's estate is not sufficient to represent the said sum, that the sum was applied by him rateably in making any gifts or settlements property comprised in which is chargeable with estate duty on his death; and

(ib) the net value after the donee's death of the property referred to in sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (a) above shall be taken to be the value on which estate duty is payable on the donee's death, and of the property referred to in sub-paragraph (ii) shall be taken to be the amount of the sum of money in question.

5. For the purposes of section thirty of this Act and of this Schedule, a disposition for partial consideration treated as a gift inter vivos for the purpose of charging duty on the later death shall not be regarded as a purchase for a consideration in money or money's worth; but where relief is given in respect of property comprised in the gift, the net value after the earlier death of the relevant property shall be abated in the same proportion in which the value on which estate duty is payable on the later death is abated by reason of the consideration.

6. In this Schedule “ death duties " includes duties payable under the law of any country or territory.

relevant expenditure (excluding, except in so far as the Secretary of State with the consent of the Treasury otherwise determines, any expenditure of a descriptor in respect of which no grant has been paid for any year ending before the sixteenth day of May, nineteen hundred and fifty-nine) and the current level of prices, costs and remuneration, together with any future variation in that level which can be foreseen;

(b) any probable fluctuation in the demand for the services

giving rise to relevant expenditure, so far as the fluctuation is attributable to circumstances prevailing in Scotland as a whole which are not under the control of local authorities; and

to which, having regard to general economic conditions, it is reasonable to develop those services.

(a) that notice has been served on the tenant by the landlord,

whether before or after the commencement of this Act, under sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 2 of the Fourth Schedule to that Act (which paragraph enables tenants under certain tenancies subsisting immediately before the commencement of that Act to retain possession until a date, not earlier than the sixth day of October, nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, specified in a notice served by the landlord); and

(b) that until the date specified in the notice, possession of the dwelling-house is retained by a person entitled to retain such possession by virtue of the said paragraph 2;

provided for the occupier during that rental period, being services provided in pursuance of this section, and for any furniture which, by virtue of this section, the occupier is entitled to use during that period; and (without prejudice to the liability of any person in respect of any other damage or dilapidations) the occupier shall be treated as exclusively responsible for all internal decorative repairs, and the owner as exclusively responsible for all other repairs, being in each case repairs required to make good damage or dilapidations occurring during the application of this Act to the dwelling-house:

Provided that where the rent recoverable for the last controlled rental period exceeds the rent which would have been payable for that period under the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the rent to be paid by the occupier under this section shall be at the rate of the rent recoverable for the last controlled rental period, subject to the like increase or reduction, if any, as would be required to be made in the rent limit under section three or section four of the Rent Act, 1957 (which relate respectively to adjustments in respect of rates and in respect of services and furniture) if the Rent Acts had not ceased to apply to the dwelling-

(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as conferring on the occupier of the dwelling-house any estate or interest therein or any power to create such an estate or interest, nor as affecting the right of the owner, subject to any other provision of this Act, to recover possession of the dwelling-house at any time without notice or further notice to quit.

(5) In the application of this section to Scotland, for subsection (2) there shall be substituted the following subsection—

“ (2) Notwithstanding anything in the said terms and conditions, the rent to be paid by the occupier under this section in respect of any rental period or part of a rental period shall be at the rate of a rent equal to the aggregate of the following amounts, that is to say—

(a) an amount equal to the rent recoverable for the last

rental period ending before the time at which the Rent Acts ceased to apply to the dwelling-house by virtue of subsection (1) of section eleven of the Rent Act, 1957, exclusive of any part thereof then recoverable by way of repairs increase; and

(b) an amount equal to one-half of the rent which was

recoverable for the last rental period ending immediately before the commencement of the Housing (Repairs and Rents) (Scotland) Act, 1954, and (without prejudice to the liability of any person in respect of any other damage or dilapidations) the occupier shall be treated as exclusively responsible for all internal decorative repairs, and the owner as exclusively responsible for all other repairs, being in each case repairs required to make good damage or dilapidations occurring during the application of this Act to the dwelling-house.

In this subsection ‘ repairs increase * has the like meaning, and the reference to the rent which was recoverable immediately before the commencement of the Housing (Repairs and Rents) (Scotland) Act, 1954, shall be construed in like manner, as in that Act.”, and subsection (3) shall be omitted.

3.—(1) Without prejudice to the power of any court apart from this section to postpone the operation or suspend the execution of an order for possession, if in proceedings by the owner against

the occupier for the recovery of possession of a dwelling-house to which this Act applies the occupier satisfies the court—

(a) that he has not unreasonably refused or failed to accept

any proposal made by the owner for the grant of a new tenancy of the premises or part of the premises, being a tenancy for a term of not less than three years and not being a tenancy to be granted at a premium or requiring the payment of increased rent in respect of any period before the date on which the proposal was made;

(b) that he has failed, after making such efforts as were reasonable in the circumstances, to obtain other appropriate accommodation;

(c) that all rent due in respect of the period from the date

referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section one of this Act (or, in so far as the amount of the rent payable in respect of that period has not been determined a reasonable sum in respect of that rent) has been paid or tendered to the owner; and

() that having regard to all the circumstances of the case greater hardship would be caused by making an order for possession without such suspension of execution as is provided by this section than by granting such suspension,

then, subject to the provisions of this section, the court shall suspend the execution of any order for possession made in the proceedings for such period, not being less than three nor more than nine months from the date of the order, as the court thinks fit.

(2) In relation to any period for which the execution of an order for possession of a dwelling-house is suspended under this section, subsection (2) of section two of this Act (except so far as that subsection relates to responsibility for repairs) shall not apply, but the rent to be paid by the occupier in respect of any rental period or part of a rental period falling within the period of suspension shall be at such rate as may be specified in the order, being the rate demanded by the owner or, if the court is satisfied that a rent at the rate so demanded would be beyond the means of the occupier, such lower rate as appears to the court to be within his means, not being less than the rate at which rent was payable immediately before the beginning of the period of suspension:

Provided that the rent payable by virtue of this subsection shall be subject to the like increase or reduction, if any, as would be required to be made in the rent limit under section three or section four of the Rent Act, 1957, if the Rent Acts had not ceased to apply to the dwelling-house and if the rental period comprising the date of the order were the basic rental period within the meaning of that Act.

(4) Where the execution of an order has been suspended under this section for any period, the court may—

(a) upon application made by the occupier not less than twenty-eight clear days before the expiration of that period or, with the leave of the court, at any subsequent time within that period, and upon being satisfied that the conditions specified in subsection (1) of this section continue to be fulfilled, suspend the execution for such further period, not exceeding six months at any one time, as the court thinks fit;

(b) upon application made by the owner or the occupier at

any time, and upon being satisfied that the circumstances by reference to which the rent specified in the order was determined have substantially changed since the order was made, vary the order so far as it specifies that rent;

and where an application is duly made under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the execution of the order shaft in any case be treated as suspended while that application is pending.

(5) A suspension of execution under subsection (1) or subsection (4) of this section may, if the court thinks fit, be granted notwithstanding that any such rent or sum as is mentioned in paragraph (c) of the said subsection (1) has not been paid or tendered, but any such suspension shall be granted subject to the payment of the amount outstanding within twenty-eight days.

(6) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) or subsection (4) of this section—

(ii) that the purchaser or tenant requires the dwelling-house for his own occupation or for occupation by any son or daughter of his over eighteen years of age, or by his father or mother; and

no suspension of execution shall be granted by virtue of this section beyond the time at which the owner is obliged to give vacant possession as aforesaid; and

(b) in any case where, if the Rent Acts had not ceased to apply to the dwelling-house, the court would have had power to make an order for the recovery of possession by the owner, the court may refuse to grant any suspension of execution, or revoke any such suspension already granted, as the case may be.

(8) In the application of this section to Scotland the proviso to subsection (2), and in subsection (6), the words “or a memorandum or note thereof” shall be omitted.

4.—(1) Section seventeen of the Act of 1920 (which provides Supplementary for the making of rules of procedure for purposes of thatprovisions* Act, and extends the jurisdiction of county courts and sheriff courts in respect of proceedings under that Act) shall have effect as if references to that Act included references to this Act; and for the purposes of that section any proceedings for the recovery of possession of a dwelling-house to which this Act applies shall be deemed to be proceedings under this Act.

(2) In proceedings for the recovery of possession of a dwelling-house in which a suspension of execution is granted or refused under section three of this Act (including any application under that section arising out of the grant of such suspension) the court shall not have power to make an order for costs except—

(a) where a suspension of execution is refused or revoked in pursuance of paragraph (b) of subsection (6) of that section; or

(b) where it appears to the court, having regard to the conduct of the parties respectively in and in connection with the proceedings, that there are special reasons for the making of such an order.

(b) he were the occupier of the holding under a tenancy

efficiency in using it, had been the same as the use to which the holding was put, and the standard of efficiency attained in using it, in the period preceding the operative date of the order.

(2) Subject to the following provisions of this section, for any year for which the assessment under the preceding subsection shows a profit, the compensation payable in respect of the holding by virtue of section seventeen of this Act shall include a sum equal to that profit.

(3) Where the profit or loss referred to in subseodon (1) of this section is assessed for any year in respect of a holding of which only part is comprised in the compulsory rights order in question, there shall also be assessed the profit or loss which an occupier of the remainder of the holding might reasonably have been expected to make for that year from his occupation of the land constituting that remainder, if he were the occupier of that land under a tenancy at a rent equal to the annual value of that land for that year, as determined in accordance with the next following subsection.

(4) Subsection (2) of the last preceding section shall apply for the purposes of the last preceding subsection as it applies for the purposes of that section, so however that the appropriate circumstances referred to in the said subsection (2), in relation to any year for which annual value falls to be determined for the purposes of the last preceding subsection, shall be taken to be the circumstances which would have existed, immediately before the beginning of that year, if—

(a) the compulsory rights order had not been made, and the authorisation referred to in that order had not been granted and no application had been made for such an authorisation;

1958

been in the state in which it was immediately before the operative date, and had been available for letting with vacant possession;

were immediately before the beginning of that year.

a loss, but the assessment for that year on the entirety of the holding shows a profit, the amount of the loss on the part retained shall be added to the amount of the profit on the entirety of the holding;

(c) if the assessment for that year on the part retained shows

a loss, and the assessment for that year on the entirety of the holding also shows a loss, but a smaller loss than the loss on the part retained, the difference between the two losses shall be ascertained, and the assessment on the entirety of the holding shall be treated as if it had shown a profit equal to the amount of the difference;

and accordingly the reference in subsection (2) of this section to a profit shown for any year by the assessment under subsection (1) of this section shall be construed as a reference to a profit shown for that year in accordance with that assessment as adjusted under this subsection.

(7) In the last preceding subsection—

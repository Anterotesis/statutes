relevant date there shall be charged, levied, collected and paid
on goods imported into the United Kingdom such Community
customs duty, if any, as is for the time being applicable in
accordance with the Treaties or, if the goods are not within
the common customs tariff of the Economic Community and
the duties chargeable are not otherwise fixed by any directly
applicable Community provision, such duty of customs, if any.
as the Treasury, on the recommendation of the Secretary of
State, may by order specify.
For this purpose " the relevant date ", in relation to any

Treaties by any temporary provision made on or with reference
to the accession of the United Kingdom to the Communities.
( 2) Where as regards goods imported into the United

European Communities Act 1972 1953
duties chargeable on the goods, or as to exempting the goods PART II
from any customs duty, as the Treasury may on the recom-
mendation of the Secretary of State determine.

customs generally shall not by reason thereof be treated as
including that Act) ; and, subject to any amendment made by

later enactment, the law in force at the passing of this Act in
relation to customs duties shall continue to apply, notwithstand-
ing that any duties are imposed for the benefit of the Com-
munities, as if the revenue from duties so imposed remained part

to goods qualifying for Commonwealth preference shall

together with paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 shall, as re-
gards relief provided for by or under the Treaties or
for conformity with any Community obligation, extend
to any customs duties.
( 6 ) As regards reliefs from import duties, the Secretary of State
may by regulations make such further provision as appears to
him to be expedient having regard to the practices adopted or to
be adopted in other member States, whether by law or adminis-
trative action and whether or not for conformity with
Community obligations ; and any such regulations may amend

Import Duties Act 1958 or section 1 of the Finance Act 1966,
as modified by this Act.
( 7 ) For the purpose of implementing Community obligations
the Commissioners of Customs and Excise shall co-operate
with other customs services on matters of mutual concern, and
( without prejudice to the foregoing) may for that purpose-
(a) give effect, in accordance with such arrangements as
they may direct or by regulations prescribe, to any
Community requirement or practice as to the move-
ment of goods between countries, including any rules
requiring payment to be made in connection with
the exportation of goods to compensate for any relief
from customs duty allowed or to be allowed (and may
recover any such payment as if it were an amount of
customs duty unpaid) ; and
( b) give effect to any reciprocal arrangements made between
member States ( with or without other countries or
territories) for securing, by the exchange of informa-
tion or otherwise, the due administration of their
customs laws and the prevention or detection of fraud
or evasion.
(8) Where on the exportation of any goods from the United
Kingdom there has been furnished for the purpose of any
Community requirement or practice any certificate or other
evidence as to the origin of those goods, or as to payments made
or relief from duty allowed in any country or territory, then
for the purpose of verifying or investigating that certificate or
evidence, the Commissioners or an officer may require the
exporter, or any other person appearing to the Commissioners
or officer to have been concerned in any way with the goods,
or with any goods from which, directly or indirectly, they have
been produced or manufactured, or to have been concerned
with the obtaining or furnishing of the certificate or evidence, -
( a ) to furnish such information, in such form and within
such time, as the Commissioners or officer may specify
in the requirement ; or
( b) to produce for inspection, and to allow the taking of

it to act for the Board, or by written directions given
to the body require it to discontinue or modify any
activity appearing to the Ministers to be prejudicial
to the proper discharge of the Board's functions ; and
( b ) may by regulations provide for the charging of fees in
connection with the discharge of any functions of the
Board.

make provision for the support of arrangements under section 1
of that Act for providing guaranteed prices or assured markets)
shall apply in relation to any Community arrangements for or
related to the regulation of the market for any agricultural
produce as if references, in whatever terms, to payments made
by virtue of section 1 were references to payments made by
virtue of the Community arrangements by or on behalf of the
Board and as if in section 5(1)( d ) the reference to the Minister
included the Board.

mentary to any directly applicable Community provision as the
Ministers consider necessary for securing the payment of any
agricultural levies so charged, including provision for the making
of declarations or the giving of other information in respect of
goods exported, shipped as stores, warehoused or otherwise dealt

(5) Except as otherwise provided by or under any enactment,
agricultural levies of the Economic Community, so far as they
are charged on goods imported into the United Kingdom,

dealt with, as if they were Community customs duties, and in
relation to those levies the following enactments shall apply as
they would apply in relation to Community customs duties, that
is to say : -

as aforesaid, the Commissioners of Customs and Excise are
charged with the performance, on behalf of the Board or other-

Kingdom, then in relation to any such refund or allowance
section 267 ( except subsection (2) (a)) and section 294 of the
Customs and Excise Act 1952 shall apply as they apply in
relation to a drawback of customs duties, and other provisions
of that Act shall have effect accordingly.
( 6 ) The enactments applied by subsection (5)( a) above shall
apply subject to such exceptions and modifications, if any, as
the Commissioners of Customs and Excise may by regulations
prescribe, and shall be taken to include section 10 of the Finance

their effect on contracts), but shall not include section 259 of
the Customs and Excise Act 1952 ( charge of duty on manufac-

such Community arrangements as aforesaid (and any obligations
of the United Kingdom in relation thereto), that section 1 of
c. 68
European Communities Act 1972 1957
the Agriculture Act 1957 should cease to apply to produce of

to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of
Parliament, provide that as from such date as may be prescribed
by the order ( but subject to such savings and transitional pro-
visions as may be so prescribed) the Act shall have effect as

goods imported into the United Kingdom, and to refunds of
any such amounts, section 6(5) above shall have effect as it has
effect in the case of other agricultural levies of the European
Community, except that the Commissioners of Customs and
Excise shall account to the Sugar Board, in such manner as the
Treasury may direct, for all money collected for the benefit of
the Board by virtue of that subsection and, pending payment to
the Board, shall deal with all such money in such manner as the
Treasury may direct.
There shall be allowed to the Commissioners, in the taking of
any account under this subsection, such sums as the Treasury
may from time to time determine in respect of their expenses
attributable to this subsection, and the amount so allowed shall
in the accounts of the Sugar Board be treated as expenses of the
Board.
(2) The Minister shall, at such times as the Treasury may
determine, pay to the Sugar Board any amount by which the
sums charged for their benefit as mentioned in subsection ( 1)
above, their receipts from dealings (as principals ) in sugar and
their other income fall short of their outgoings, whether in
respect of those dealings, or of payments to be made by them in
respect of imports under any directly applicable Community
provision, or otherwise ; but if at any time it appears to the
Minister that the Sugar Board have accumulated funds in
excess of the amount that they reasonably require to have
available for the performance of their functions, he may direct

their opinion substantially representative of the growers of home-
grown beet that the processors and that body are unable to agree
on the prices and other terms and conditions for the purchase of
home- grown beet by the processors, the Ministers may deter-
mine or designate a person to determine those prices ,
terms and conditions ; and any purchase by processors for which
prices, terms and conditions have been so determined, or
contract for such a purchase, shall take effect as a purchase or
contract for purchase at those prices and on those terms and
conditions.

Act 1956 ; and in this section, as in that Act, " the Minister "
means the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and " the

serve a counter-notice on the district council disputing the right of

the highways in respect of which the powers of the district council
are exercisable at the time the agreement is made, or, as the case
may be, the notice is served.

are the highway authority for that highway, again become exercis-
able with respect to that highway at any time within the period of ten
years beginning with the day on which the powers cease to be so

with the consent of the county council, before the expiry, the district
council intend again to exercise those powers with respect to that
highway, paragraphs 2 and 3(1) above shall not apply and those
powers shall become exercisable at the expiry of the period of six
weeks beginning with the date on which the county council who
are the highway authority receive notice of the district council's
intention under paragraph 1 above.
( 3) If, by virtue of paragraph 3(2) or sub-paragraph (1) above, the
powers of a district council under section 187(2) above cease to be
exercisable with respect to any highway, the cessation shall not affect

for the words three years there shall be substituted the
words " two years ".
(3) An offender shall not be dealt with by means of a sen-
tence of imprisonment suspended under section 39 of the
said Act of 1967 unless the case appears to the court to be
one in which a sentence of imprisonment would have been
appropriate in the absence of any power to suspend such a
sentence.
12.-( 1 ) Where a court sentences an offender for a single Suspended
offence to imprisonment for a term of more than six months sentence
and makes an order suspending the sentence under section 39(1 ) supervision
orders.of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, the court may make a sus-
pended sentence supervision order ( in this Act referred to as
66 a supervision order ") placing the offender under the super-
vision of a supervising officer for a period specified in the order
not exceeding the period which under the said section 39(1 )
is the operational period in relation to the suspended sentence.
(2) The Secretary of State may by order-
(a) direct that subsection ( 1) above be amended by sub-
stituting, for the number of months specified in the
subsection as originally enacted or as previously
amended under this paragraph, such other number

c. 71
PART I ( b) make in that subsection the repeals necessary to enable
a court to exercise the powers of the subsection in the
case of any suspended sentence, whatever the length
of the term.
Orders under this subsection shall be made by statutory
instrument subject to annulment by resolution of either House
of Parliament ; and an order under paragraph (a) may be
revoked by a subsequent order under paragraph (a ) or (b) .
(3) A supervision order shall specify the petty sessions area
in which the offender resides or will reside ; and the supervising
officer shall be a probation officer appointed for or assigned
to that area.
( 4) An offender in respect of whom a supervision order is in
force shall keep in touch with the supervising officer in accord-
ance with such instructions as he may from time to time be
given by that officer and shall notify him of any change of
address.

forthwith give copies of the order to a probation officer assigned
to the court , and he shall give a copy to the offender and the
supervising officer ; and the court shall, except where it is itself
a magistrates ' court acting for the petty sessions area specified
in the order, send to the clerk to the justices for the petty
sessions area specified in the order a copy of the order, together
with such documents and information relating to the case as
it considers likely to be of assistance to that court in exercising
its functions in relation to the order.
( 6) If a magistrates' court acting for the petty sessions area
specified in a supervision order is satisfied that the offender
proposes to change, or has changed, his residence from that
petty sessions area to another petty sessions area, the court may,
and if application in that behalf is made by the supervising
officer shall, amend the order by substituting the other petty
sessions area for the area specified therein, and references in
this Act to the area specified in a supervision order shall be
construed accordingly.
( 7 ) Where a supervision order is amended by a court under
subsection (6) of this section the court shall send to the clerk
to the justices for the area which is specified in the order in
consequence of the amendment a copy of the order, together
with such documents and information relating to the case as it
considers likely to be of assistance to a court acting for that
area in exercising its functions in relation to the order.

the end of the period specified in it-
( a ) a court orders under section 40 of the said Act of 1967

which the order was made shall have effect ; or
( b) the order is discharged or replaced under the subsequent
provisions of this section .
( 9) A supervision order may be discharged, on the application
of the supervising officer or the offender, by the magistrates'
court acting for the petty sessions area specified in the order

and includes a direction to that effect, the power conferred by
this subsection shall be exercisable by the Crown Court and
not by a magistrates' court.
(10 ) Where under paragraph (c) of subsection ( 1) of section 40
of the said Act of 1967 a court varies the operational period
of a suspended sentence, or under paragraph (d ) of that subsec-
tion makes no order with respect to such a sentence, the court
may make a supervision order in respect of the offender-
( a) in place of any such order made when the suspended
sentence was passed ; or
( b) if the court which passed the sentence could have made
such an order but did not do so ; or
( c ) if that court had not the power to make such an order
but would have had the power with subsection ( 1) of
this section in force as it is at the time when the
offender is dealt with under section 40(1) .
(11) On making a supervision order the court shall in ordinary
language explain its effect to the offender.

( 2) For the purpose of proving any such debt in the proceedings,
a copy of the criminal bankruptcy order shall, subject to paragraph
6 of this Schedule, be treated as sufficient evidence of the debt

of the relevant loss or damage is greater or less than the amount
specified in the order, or that the loss or damage did not in fact result
from any offence specified in the order ; and if it is shown as aforesaid
that the amount of the relevant loss or damage is greater than that
specified in the order, sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph shall have
effect as if the greater amount had been specified in the order .

THE INDEX TO
THE STATUTES IN FORCE
These two volumes (A-K, L-Z) index by subject-matter all the existing public general statute law under well-established headings linked by numerous cross-references. The index entries have against them references to the enactment or enactments which support the subject matter.
Since the references are to enactments (and not to pages of any book), the usefulness of the volumes is not limited to any particular set of statutes.
There is a chronological table showing the headings under which each Act or section is indexed in volumes, and a similar table for Church Assembly Measures.
The INDEX provides a service which is of the utmost value and which for its adaptability is unique.

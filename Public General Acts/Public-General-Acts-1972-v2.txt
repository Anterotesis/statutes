income from rents for the immediately preceding year, and if
there is no such excess the amount shall be taken as zero .
( 6 ) For the purposes of this section there is a shortfall in a
local authority's rent increases for any year if the amount of those
increases is less than the local authority's standard amount for

the local authority for the year 1972-73 , or the with-
drawal factor, whichever is the less,
( c ) for the year 1974-75 and subsequent years, the amount
of the residual subsidy payable to the local authority
for the immediately preceding year, or half the with-
drawal factor, whichever is the less.
( 8) The preceding provisions of this section shall apply to a
new town corporation as they apply to a local authority.
( 9) The provisions of this section as to the circumstances in

any person who occupies a dwelling let by them other than a

to rebates if they occupied Housing Revenue Account dwellings
of rebates from rent calculated as if they were rebates granted
by virtue of section 18 above ; but a scheme made under this
subsection shall be treated as an allowance scheme for the
purposes of this Part of this Act.
( 11) In this section " local authority " does not include the
Greater London Council.
20.-( 1 ) Subject to the provisions of this Act , every rebate
scheme and every allowance scheme shall conform with the

level of the rents of the Housing Revenue Account
dwellings of other housing authorities,
( b) that the general level of the rents paid by private tenants

paid by private tenants elsewhere, or
( c ) that the general level of the rents of a class of Housing
Revenue Account dwellings of a housing authority,
or of the rents paid by private tenants for a class of
dwellings in the area of a local authority, is exception-
ally high by comparison with the general level of the
rents of the Housing Revenue Account dwellings of
other housing authorities or, as the case may be, with
the general level of the rents paid by private tenants
elsewhere,
he may, on the application of the authority made before or after
the passing of this Act, authorise them to treat Schedule 3 to
c. 47
Housing Finance Act 1972 967
this Act, as it applies in relation to their rebate scheme or their
allowance scheme, but in a case under paragraph (c) above only
as it applies to the relevant class of dwellings, as providing,
during such period as may be specified in the direction, for such
lower minimum rent or higher maximum rebate or allowance
as he may direct.
(6 ) The Secretary of State may make an authorisation under
subsection (5) above conditional upon compliance by the
authority with such terms as he may specify in granting it.
( 7 ) In this Act, the " model scheme " of an authority means
a rebate scheme, or as the case may be an allowance scheme,
containing such provisions, and only such provisions, as the
authority are for the time being required by this section to
include in their scheme :
Provided that if and so long as the authority's scheme con-
tains any provision included in pursuance of subsection (5)
above, section 19( 8) of this Act or paragraph 16 of Schedule
3 to this Act, the model scheme shall also be assumed to include
that provision.
( 8) In this Act an authority's " standard amount of rent
rebates " or " standard amount of rent allowances " means for
any period-
( a) if the authority have been operating the model scheme
for that period, the amount of rebates, or, as the case
may be, allowances which they have granted for that
period otherwise than under subsection ( 1) or sub-
section (2) of section 21 below ;
( b ) if the authority have not been operating the model
scheme for that period, the amount of rebates, or, as
the case may be, allowances, which they would have
granted for that period otherwise than under subsection
(1) or subsection (2) of section 21 below if they had
been operating it ;
and in this subsection " period " includes a period in the year
1972-73 .
( 9) The said standard amount shall be calculated or esti-
mated by reference to the rebates or allowances actually granted
by following such methods and principles as the Secretary of
State may direct, either generally or in any particular case.

The permitted

rebates and
allowances.
( 3) Ahousing authority may vary the provisions of Schedule 3
to this Act as they apply in relation to their rebate scheme,
but no variation under this subsection shall be such that a person
to whom the scheme applies receives less rebate than he would
have received under the model scheme, and if a variation is
made in a rebate scheme by a local authority the authority
making it shall make a variation in their allowance scheme
which appears to them to correspond to it.
( 4) A local authority may vary the provisions of Schedule 3
to this Act as they apply in relation to their allowance scheme,
but no variation under this subsection shall be such that a
person to whom the scheme applies receives a smaller allowance
than he would have received under the model scheme, and if a
variation is made in an allowance scheme the authority making
it shall make a variation in their rebate scheme which appears
to them to correspond to it.
( 5) The powers conferred by this section shall not be exercised
by any authority in such a way that, on the best estimate which
they can make, they are likely as a result to grant a greater
amount of rebates or allowances than the amount which is for
the time being the permitted total for the authority.
22.-( 1 ) For any authority the permitted total of rebates or
allowances for any year or part of a year is 110 per cent. of
the authority's standard amount of rent rebates or, as the case
may be, standard amount of rent allowances.
( 2) The chief financial officer of every housing authority shall
send to the Secretary of State as soon as possible after the end
of each year a certificate stating whether the amount of rebates
granted by the authority for that year did or did not exceed
the sum which was the permitted total of rebates for the
authority for that year and, together with the certificate, a copy
of the authority's rebate scheme for that year.
( 3 ) The chief financial officer of every local authority shall
also send to the Secretary of State as soon as possible after the
end of each year a certificate stating whether the amount of
allowances granted by the authority for that year did or did
not exceed the sum which was the permitted total of allowances
for the authority for that year and, together with the certificate,
a copy of the authority's allowance scheme for that year.
( 4 ) If the amount of rebates or allowances granted for a year
by an authority exceeds the amount which was the permitted
total for that authority for that year, it shall be the duty of
the authority, subject to subsections (9) and (10) below, to send
to the Secretary of State, together with their certificate under sub-
section (2) or, as the case may be, subsection (3) above, pro-
posals that their rebate scheme, or, as the case may be, their
c . 47
Housing Finance Act 1972 969
allowance scheme, shall have effect from a specified date with
such variations as will in the opinion of the authority make it
probable that the amount of rebates or, as the case may be,
allowances , granted by the authority for the year in which the
proposals are made will be not greater than the amount which
is the permitted total for the authority for that year.
( 5 ) If in the opinion of the Secretary of State an authority's
proposals will make it probable that the amount of rebates or
allowances granted by the authority for the year in which it is
proposed that the scheme shall be varied will be not greater
than the amount which is the permitted total for that authority
for that year, he shall approve the proposals .
( 6) If in the opinion of the Secretary of State an authority's
proposals will not make it probable that the amount of rebates
or allowances granted by the authority for the year in which it is
proposed that the scheme shall be varied will be not greater than
the amount which is the permitted total for that authority for
that year, he shall direct the authority to make such further
or other variations in the scheme, to have effect from such date
as he may specify, as will in his opinion have that result.
( 7) It shall be the duty of an authority to make any varia-
tions in a scheme which are approved by the Secretary of State
under subsection (5) above or directed by him under subsection
( 6) above and to operate the scheme as varied for any period
which the Secretary of State may specify.
( 8) If a variation under subsection ( 7) above is made in one
of a local authority's schemes the authority shall make a
variation in their other scheme which appears to them to corres-
pond to it.
( 9) If the amount of rebates or allowances granted for a year
by an authority exceeds the amount which was the permitted
total for that authority for that year, but the authority satisfy
the Secretary of State during the following year that it is
improbable that the amount of rebates or, as the case may be,
allowances granted by the authority for that year will exceed
the amount which is the permitted total for the authority for
that year, he may direct that subsections ( 4) to ( 8) above shall
not apply to that authority for that year.
( 10) If the amount of rebates or allowances granted for the
year 1972-73 by a local authority exceeds the amount which was
the permitted total for that authority for that year, but the
authority satisfy the Secretary of State that, because of the
changes in local authorities or local government areas made by
any Act of the present Session to make provision with respect
to local government and the functions of local authorities in
England and Wales, it is undesirable that the provisions of their

increase is distributed or apportioned among the authority's
qualifying dwellings, that increase towards fair rents is likely to

( 9) In any case where a housing association are entitled to new
building subsidy but are precluded by their rules or constituent
instrument from granting tenancies for some or all of their
dwellings, the reference in paragraph (b) of subsection ( 5) above
to the amount which would be registered as a fair rent shall be
construed, in relation to those dwellings, as a reference to the
amount which in the opinion of the Secretary of State would be
registered as a fair rent if they were available for letting at a
rent.
(10) In any case to which subsection (9) above applies the
Secretary of State may assume, without prejudice to subsections
(7) and (8) above, that the dwellings would be let on such

( a ) the year of completion, or
( b ) the second or third year for which new building subsidy
is payable,
payment of an amount of subsidy equal to the percentage of
the initial deficit shown in the Table in subsection (6) above will
be inadequate, having regard to their normal sources of income,
to enable them to meet such expenditure (including loan charges)
as in his opinion it would be reasonable for them to incur for
that year in the exercise of their housing functions, he may
direct that for that year the percentage of the initial deficit to
be met by subsidy shall be greater than that shown in the Table
but not greater than 90 per cent. , or than the percentage met by
subsidy for the immediately preceding year if that was less
than 90 per cent.
(13) The Secretary of State may by order, after consultation
with such bodies representative of housing associations as appear
to him to be appropriate, provide that in relation to building
schemes approved by him and in relation either to all housing
associations or to any description of such associations mentioned
in the order-
( a) if the year of completion is later than the year
1981-82, the percentage of the initial deficit to be met
by new building subsidy for any year shall be altered
to such percentage other than that shown in the Table
as may be specified in the order ;
(b) that new building subsidy shall be payable for a number
of years other than ten ;
and an order under this subsection may make such conse-
quential amendments in subsection ( 12 ) above as appear to the
Secretary of State to be appropriate.
(14 ) An order under subsection ( 13) above shall be made with
the concurrence of the Treasury by statutory instrument subject
to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of
Parliament and may be varied or revoked by a subsequent
order under that subsection.

paragraph.
( 3) The working balance at the end of a year shall not be of an

( b ) which is such as to make the total of the amounts of the
subsidies and rate fund contributions within the Table
in Part III of this Schedule, or the deficit shown in the
account, greater than it would be if the working balances
at the beginning and end of the year were equal ( or such as
to create entitlement to subsidy, or liability to make rate
fund contributions, or a deficit , which would not exist if
the working balances were equal) .
Treatment of deficit
16.- (1) If for any year, after giving effect to the preceding pro-
visions of this Schedule, a deficit is shown in the account, the local

subsequent year the provisions of this paragraph shall have effect
where any rent allowance subsidy is payable to the local authority
for the year, and paragraph 17(4) above shall not apply.
( 2 ) If the standard amount of rent allowances is equal to or exceeds
the amount of the surplus, the Secretary of State shall pay to the
local authority for the credit of the general rate fund an amount
equal to the surplus multiplied by the fraction of which-
( a ) the numerator is the difference, if any, between the standard
amount of rent allowances and the rent allowance subsidy

account-
( a ) all sums to be credited to the account in respect of any
item in the Table in Part III of this Schedule, and
(b) any rate fund contribution under paragraph 16( 1) above.
( 3) If, on that assumption, there would be no deficit, the sum
sufficient to balance the account shall be taken as zero.

shall be applied, and all calculations shall be made, by reference
to the rent which would have been paid if the arrangements had
not been made.
( 3) Where-
( a ) a Housing Revenue Account dwelling is let to one of two
spouses or one of two spouses is a private tenant, and
(b) the premises are not occupied by the tenant, and
( c ) the other spouse is in occupation of the premises and has
paid the rent in respect of any rental period,

treat the spouse who has paid the rent as the tenant for the purposes
of this Schedule and grant a rebate, or as the case may be, an
allowance accordingly, and an authority may treat as spouses for
the purposes of this sub- paragraph a man and a woman who formerly
lived with him in the dwelling as his wife.

2.- (1 ) When an authority receive an application for a rebate or
allowance, whether before or after their rebate scheme or allow-
ance scheme comes into operation, it shall be their duty, subject
to sub-paragraph ( 2) below, to determine whether the applicant is
entitled to a rebate or an allowance and, if so, the amount to which
he is so entitled ; and they shall request him in writing to furnish
such information and such evidence as they may reasonably require
for that purpose as to the following matters namely-
( a ) the persons who reside in the dwelling occupied by him ;

Assessment of income
3.- (1) If an authority are satisfied on an application for a rebate
or an allowance that the applicant is eligible for consideration for a
rebate or an allowance, it shall be their duty to assess the amount
which is likely to be the income of the applicant and of any spouse
of his during the rebate period or, as the case may be, the allowance
period .
( 2) In so far as a person's income consists of earnings from a
gainful occupation, the amount which is likely to be the income shall
be calculated or estimated by reference to the average of his earnings
from that occupation over a period ending with his last pay-day
before the application and being a period-
(a ) of five weeks, if he is paid weekly,
(b ) of two months, if he is paid monthly,
so, however, that in any case the authority may have regard to the
average of a person's earnings from a gainful occupation over such
other period or periods as appear to them to be appropriate in order
properly to assess the amount which is likely to be his income
during the rebate period or the allowance period, as the case may be.
( 3) In so far as a person's earnings from any gainful occupation
comprise salary, wages or fees related to a fixed period, the gross
amount of his salary, wages or fees shall be taken into account ; and
in so far as a person's earnings from any gainful occupation do not
comprise salary, wages or fees related to a fixed period, the net
profit derived from that occupation shall be taken into account.
( 4 ) In so far as a person's income does not consist of earnings from
a gainful occupation, its weekly amount shall be calculated or esti-
mated, subject to sub-paragraph ( 5) below, on such basis as
appears to the authority to be appropriate in the circumstances of
the particular case .
( 5) The Secretary of State may give directions to authorities in
general as to the manner in which they are to calculate the income
of persons who belong to classes of persons to whom payments are
made by virtue of any enactment which in his opinion are not
taxable and are of amounts calculated on the basis that they are not
taxable.
( 6 ) In this paragraph-

than as a weekly amount falls to be taken into account for the
purposes of this paragraph, it shall be converted into the weekly
amount which represents it, and that amount shall be treated as the
relevant amount for those purposes .
c.47
Housing Finance Act 1972 1081

period or allowance period shall commence at the commencement of

was received.

to paragraphs 5 and 6 below-
( a ) if the tenant is of pensionable age, not later than twelve
months after the date on which he was notified that his
application for a rebate or an allowance was granted ; and
( b ) in any other case, not later than six months after that date.
5.- (1) If at any time between the making of an application for a
rebate or an allowance and any determination made on that applica-
tion there is a change of circumstances such that the applicant may be
reasonably expected to know that it may reduce the amount to which
he is entitled, it shall be the duty of the applicant to notify the
authority of that change.
(2) If after a rebate or an allowance has been granted to a tenant
and before the end of the rebate period or allowance period there
is a change of circumstances such that the tenant may be reasonably
expected to know that it may affect his entitlement or reduce the
amount to which he is entitled, it shall be the duty of the tenant to
notify the authority of that change.
( 3) If during a rebate period or an allowance period an authority
receive a notification of a change of circumstances under sub-para-
graph (2) above, or consider, without receiving such a notification, that
there has been such a change in the tenant's circumstances as will
affect the tenant's entitlement or reduce the amount to which he is
entitled, the authority shall determine, according to the circumstances,
either that the period shall terminate on a date earlier than it would
otherwise terminate or that the amount of rebate or allowance shall be
altered in respect of such rental period or periods as they consider
appropriate.
6.- (1) If during a rebate period or an allowance period an
authority receive from a tenant a notification of a change of circum-
stances relating to him which might entitle him to a higher rebate
or allowance, the authority, if they are of the opinion, after obtaining
and considering such information and evidence as they require, that
the tenant is entitled to a higher rebate or allowance, shall determine,
according to the circumstances, that the period shall terminate on a
date earlier than that on which it would otherwise terminate, or that
the amount of rebate or allowance shall be increased in respect of
any rental period or periods commencing after the date on which the
circumstances changed.
( 2 ) If an authority determine under sub- paragraph (1) above that
a rebate period or allowance period ought to terminate, they shall
invite the tenant to submit a further application for a rebate, or, as the
case may be, an allowance.

SCH. 4 7. If there is such an alteration in the terms of a rebate scheme
or allowance scheme or in the rent as to affect the amount of
rebate or allowance to which a tenant is entitled, the authority
shall make such alterations as may be appropriate in the amount
of his rebate or allowance.
8. It shall not be the duty of an authority to alter a rebate or
allowance under paragraph 5, 6 or 7 above if the alteration would be
equal to or less than the amount of the minimum rebate or minimum
allowance under the authority's rebate scheme or allowance scheme.
9. Without prejudice to any other right to recover the amount of
any rebate or allowance which has been wrongly granted, where any
person has received a rebate or allowance to which he was not
entitled, it may be recovered from him by deduction from sums
which would otherwise be granted to him by way of rebate or
allowance.

entertained if it is made more than one month before the end
of the current period.

the end of that period, the new rebate period or allowance period
shall commence with the first rental period after the end of the
former period.
( 4) If the application is made at any later date, the new period
shall commence with the first rental period after the date of the
application :

stances are exceptional, allow the new period to commence with
the first rental period after the end of the former rebate or allowance
period .
( 5) Subject to this paragraph, the provisions of this Schedule shall
apply on an application for a further rebate or allowance as they
apply on a first application.

ately preceding that in which the rebate scheme under this
Act of the authority who granted him that rebate comes
into operation ; or
c. 47
Housing Finance Act 1972 1083
( ii ) was met, for the rental period immediately preced-
ing that in which the allowance scheme under this Act
of the authority in whose area his dwelling is comes into
operation, by an allowance granted by virtue of a
scheme under a local Act for the payment of such
allowances ; and
( b ) the terms on which the rebate or allowance was granted for
that rental period are identical with those on which rebates
or, as the case may be, allowances, are to be granted under
the relevant scheme under this Act,
the authority may treat him, for all the purposes of this Schedule or
Schedule 3 above, as if he were a person to whom they had granted
under this Act a rebate or, as the case may be, an allowance for
the first rental period after the relevant scheme came into operation.

period in which his application was made or any other
rental period in the allowance period.
( 2 ) An authority may terminate an allowance period or pay the
allowance to the tenant's landlord for any rental period within the

ance period.

application for rent rebate or rent allowance which is
pending when a person becomes entitled to supplementary
benefit ; and
( c ) the method of dealing with cases where it is difficult to
ascertain whether a person has been in receipt of supple-
mentary benefit for more than eight weeks.
( 3) Any direction under this paragraph shall have effect notwith-
standing anything in Part I of this Schedule.
17.- (1 ) An authority shall not, under this Schedule, require the
tenant, as respects any period for which he is in receipt of supple-
mentary benefit, to give any information to the authority, other than
such information as may for the time being be specified for the
purposes of this paragraph by any direction given by the Secretary
of State, either generally or in any particular case.
( 2 ) An authority shall afford to the Secretary of State such informa-
tion in their possession as he may require to give effect to the Ministry
of Social Security Act 1966 as amended by this Act, and the Secretary
of State and the Supplementary Benefits Commission shall afford to
every authority such information concerning claims for, and payments
of, supplementary benefit as the authority may require to give effect
to Schedule 3 to this Act and this Schedule.
( 3) Without prejudice to the generality of sub-paragraph ( 2) above,
where the authority are to ascertain the amounts specified in para-
graph 20( 2) of Schedule 3 to this Act for a person who is in receipt
of supplementary benefit, whether in the first eight weeks or later
( or for a person whose income is to be aggregated with that of a
person in receipt of supplementary benefit ) it shall be the duty of
the Commission to notify the authority of those amounts as
estimated or determined by the Commission and to supply the
authority with such particulars of the resources of the tenant and any
spouse as will enable the authority to ascertain the weekly income
of the tenant and any spouse.
( 4 ) An authority and the Secretary of State may from time to
time enter into any arrangements for purposes of administrative
convenience which, without affecting the total relief available to any
tenant-
(a) authorise the authority to grant a rebate or allowance greater
than, or less than, the amount required by or under the
authority's scheme, or to grant, or refrain from granting, a
rebate or allowance where the provisions of the scheme
provide otherwise, and
( b) require the authority to pay to the Secretary of State such
amount, estimated in a manner determined by the arrange-
ments , as reflects any liability to give relief to the tenant
transferred by the arrangements from the authority to the
Secretary of State,
and where any arrangements within paragraph ( a) above were made
in the period beginning on 1st April 1972 and ending with the coming
c.47
Housing Finance Act 1972 1087
into force of this Act, the local authority shall have power to pay to
the Secretary of State such amount in respect of any liability to give
relief to the tenant transferred by the arrangements to the Secretary
of State as may be determined by them on a formula agreed with
the Secretary of State.
(5) Without prejudice to paragraph 16 above, the Secretary of
State may give directions to authorities in general or any individual
authority or description of authority requiring them in such cases
and circumstances as may be specified in the direction to grant a
rebate or allowance greater than, or less than, the amount required
by or under their scheme, or to grant, or refrain from granting,
a rebate or allowance where the provisions of the scheme provide
otherwise, and to pay to the Secretary of State such amount, to be
estimated in such manner as may be so specified, as reflects any
liability to give relief to the authority's tenants which is transferred
in accordance with the directions from the authority to the Secretary
of State.
( 6 ) Any reference in this Act to the amount of rebates or allowances
granted by an authority for a year or other period shall include an
amount which in the opinion of the Secretary of State represents
the rebates or allowances which would have been granted but for
any arrangements under sub-paragraph ( 4) or directions under sub-
paragraph (5) above, estimated in such manner as the Secretary of
State may direct ; and a corresponding adjustment shall be made
in arriving at the amount to be treated for any purpose of this Act
as an authority's standard amount of rent rebates or rent allowances.

SCHEDULE 6
RESTRICTION ON RENT INCREASES
1.- (1 ) This paragraph applies where a rent for a dwelling- house
which is subject to a regulated tenancy is registered under Part IV
of the Rent Act 1968 and-
( a ) the registration is the first registration, and the tenancy has
become a regulated tenancy by virtue of Part III of this
Act, or section 43 of the Housing Act 1969, or section 35
of this Act, or
( b ) the registration is the first after the completion, during the
existence of the regulated tenancy, of works towards the
cost of which a grant was payable under Part I of the
Housing Act 1969.
( 2) If the rent payable under the tenancy for any statutory period
beginning during the period of delay imposed by paragraph 2 of this
Schedule is less than the rent so registered, it shall not be increased
by a notice of increase under section 22(2) of the Rent Act 1968
except to the extent (if any) permitted under the following provisions
of this Schedule: and any such notice which purports to increase
it further shall have effect to increase it to the extent so permitted
but no further.
( 3) If after the tenancy becomes a regulated tenancy, or as the
case may be after the completion of the works, and whether or not
before the beginning of the period of delay, an agreement increasing
the rent under the tenancy takes effect, the rent limit for any period
of that tenancy (whether contractual or statutory ) beginning during
the period of delay shall be the amount to which, if the agreement
had not been made, the rent could have been increased in accordance
with this Schedule for a statutory period beginning at the same time,
and in relation to such a contractual period the reference in section
47( 3) of the Rent Act 1968 to section 20( 2) of that Act shall be
construed as a reference to this sub-paragraph.
( 4) Where sub-paragraph (3) above applies to a statutory period,
sub-paragraph ( 2 ) of this paragraph shall not apply to that period.
( 5 ) Nothing in this Schedule shall prevent the rent being increased
to the previous limit, calculated in accordance with paragraph 3
below, and nothing in this Schedule shall be taken to enable any rent
to be increased above the amount registered.
( 6 ) Subject to sub-paragraph (5) above, the registration, during
the period of delay, of a rent superseding, and lower than, the rent
registered at the beginning of the period of delay shall not affect
the amount by which the rent may be increased in the period of
delay.
2. The period of delay shall begin with the date of registration,
and its duration and the extent to which the rent may be increased
in the period of delay, shall be as set out in the Table below
where-
"
" the step means the excess of the rent registered at the
beginning of the period of delay over the previous limit,
and
c.47
Housing Finance Act 1972 1091
" increase in recoverable rent for an improvement " means an

increase in rent made by virtue of section 25(1) or section
56 of the Rent Act 1968, or by virtue of section 37( 3) of 1968 c. 23.
this Act, and
" add " means that for any rental period beginning on or after
the date as at which the addition is to be made the rent may
be increased up to the previous limit, calculated in accord-
ance with paragraph 3 below, with any previous addition
under the Table, plus the specified addition,
and any reference to the addition of either a fraction of the step or
a specified sum per week is a reference to an addition of which-
ever represents the greater increase of rent.

period of delay is unaffected.
On the date of the later registra-
tion add the excess of the
later registered rent over the
earlier registered rent; in
other respects the additions
appropriate to the earlier
registration are unaffected.

Previous limit SCH. 6
3. (1) For the purposes of this Schedule the previous limit of a
rent shall be taken to be, subject to sub-paragraph (2) of this
paragraph, the amount which at the date of registration was recover-
able by way of the rent or would have been so recoverable if all
notices of increase authorised by the Rent Act 1968 or by section 1968 c. 23.
37( 3) of this Act had been served.
( 2) Where the rent includes an amount payable in respect of
rates, the amount so payable, ascertained in accordance with
Schedule 4 to the Rent Act 1968, shall be deducted from the amount
specified in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph in calculating the
previous limit of the rent.
Agreements with tenants having security of tenure
Tenancy granted between conversion or improvement and the
registration of rent
4.(1 ) This paragraph applies where-
( a ) in the period between the conversion or improvement and
the registration of a rent, the tenant, or any person who
might succeed him as a statutory tenant, becomes the
tenant under a new regulated tenancy of the dwelling-
house, and
( b) paragraph 1 of this Schedule would have applied if the
previous tenancy had continued and the new tenancy had
not been granted.
( 2) The preceding provisions of this Schedule shall apply as if
the said previous tenancy had continued, and the rent limit for any
period ( whether contractual or statutory ) of the new regulated
tenancy beginning during the period of delay shall be the amount
to which, if the original tenancy had continued, the rent payable
thereunder could have been increased in accordance with this
Schedule for a statutory period beginning at the same time, and in
relation to such a contractual period the reference in section 47( 3) of
the Rent Act 1968 to section 20( 2) of that Act shall be construed as
a reference to this paragraph.
(3) In this paragraph “ conversion or improvement " means the
time when the tenancy in paragraph 1( 1)( a) above becomes a regu-
lated tenancy, or as the case may be the time when the works in
paragraph 1 (1)(b) above are completed.
Rent agreement taking effect between conversion or improvement
and the registration of rent
5.- (1) If, in the period between the conversion or improvement
and the registration of a rent, a rent agreement with a tenant having
security of tenure takes effect as respects the dwelling-house, and the
landlord has conformed with the requirements of section 44( 5) of this
Act, or with sections 43 and 45 of this Act, then the preceding
provisions of this Schedule shall apply as respects the period after

on the date when the agreement took effect .
( 2 ) Where this paragraph applies, the Table in this Schedule shall
have effect as if all the Cases, other than Cases A and F, were
omitted.
( 3) In this paragraph-
" conversion or improvement " has the same meaning as in para-
graph 4 above,
6 " rent agreement with a tenant having security of tenure " has
the meaning given by section 43(1) of this Act.
Tenancy granted after registration of rent to a tenant having
security of tenure
6. Where during the period of delay in any Case the tenant, or
any person who might succeed him as a statutory tenant, becomes
the tenant under a new regulated tenancy of the dwelling-house
paragraph 4(2) above shall apply as it applies to a tenancy granted
before the registration of a rent .
Supplemental
7. In ascertaining for the purposes of this Schedule whether there
is any difference between amounts, or what that difference is, such
adjustments shall be made as may be necessary to take account of
periods of different lengths ; and for that purpose a month shall be
treated as one-twelfth and a week as one fifty- second of a year.
8.- (1) In this Schedule " registration " means registration of a
rent under Part IV of the Rent Act 1968, and " registered " shall be
construed accordingly.
( 2) Where a registration takes effect from a date earlier than the
date of registration, references in this Schedule to the date of
registration shall nonetheless be references to the later date.
( 3) Where a rent designated or determined by a rent assessment
committee is registered in substitution for a rent determined by the
rent officer, the preceding provisions of this Schedule shall have effect
as if only the rent designated or determined by the rent assessment
committee had been registered ; but the date of registration shall be
deemed for the purposes of this Schedule ( but not for the purposes
of section 22 (3) of the Rent Act 1968) to be the date on which the
rent determined by the rent officer was registered.
( 4) Where any provision of this Schedule imposes a rent limit for
a statutory period in the period of delay, section 22(2) of the Rent
Act 1968 shall have effect as if for references to the registered rent
there were substituted references to that rent limit.
Transitional provisions

with Case H, apply if the registration is after the expiration of a
period of one month beginning with the date on which this Act is

Case D of the Table in this Schedule applies .
( 2 ) On a registration before 1st January 1973 which is the first
registration after the tenancy becomes a regulated tenancy by virtue
of Part III of this Act, the said Schedule 3 shall apply as if the
tenancy became a tenancy by virtue of Part III of the Housing Act
1969; and then paragraph 4 of that Schedule ( the previous limit)
shall have effect as if a notice of increase authorised by section 37(3)
of this Act were included among the notices of increase there
referred to.
( 3) The said Schedule 3 shall have effect subject to the following
modifications.
( 4) For any year of a period of delay under that Schedule which
begins on or after 1st January 1973 paragraph 3(3) of that Schedule
shall have effect with the substitution for the reference to 374 new
pence of a reference to 50 new pence.
( 5 ) Where the second year of a period of delay of four years under
the said Schedule 3 begins on or after 1st January 1973, the period
of delay shall instead be two years, and the fraction in the third
column of the Table in the said paragraph 3 for the second year
shall be three fifths, and not two fifths .
(6) Where sub-paragraph (5 ) above does not apply, and any year
of a period of delay of four years begins on or after 1st January
1973, the period of delay shall instead be three years, and, if the
said date falls in the second year of delay, the fraction in the said
third column for the third year shall be four fifths, and not three
fifths.
( 7) Where the registration is in November or December 1972, and
is the first registration after the tenancy has become a regulated
tenancy by virtue of Part III of the Housing Act 1969-
( a ) the period of delay shall end on 31st December 1974, and
( b ) the stages by which the rent may progress to the amount
registered shall be on the same dates, and of the same
amounts, as prescribed by Case A of the Table above for
a period of delay beginning on 1st January 1973 .
( 8 ) If in a period of delay under the said Schedule 3 the registra-
tion at the beginning of the period of delay is superseded by a later
registration of a higher rent, and the later registration is on or after
1st January 1973—
( a ) paragraph 6( 4) of the said Schedule 3 shall not apply, and
( b ) the rent for any rental period beginning after the second
registration may be increased by an amount equal to the
excess of the later registered rent over the earlier registered
rent, in addition to any other permitted increase.
(9) Subject to the next following sub-paragraph, the repeal by this
Act of section 52 of, and of Schedule 3 to, the Housing Act 1969

taken for the purposes of this Act to involve development of
the land, that is to say-
( a ) the carrying out of works for the maintenance, improve-
ment or other alteration of any building, being works
which affect only the interior of the building or which
do not materially affect the external appearance of the
building and (in either case) are not works for making
good war damage or works begun after 7th December,
1969 for the alteration of a building by providing
additional space therein below ground ;
( b) the carrying out by a local highway authority of any
works required for the maintenance or improvement
of a road, being works carried out on land within the

is thereby extended, or the height of the deposit is
thereby extended and exceeds the level of the land
adjoining the site .
( 4 ) Without prejudice to any regulations made under the pro-
visions of this Act relating to the control of advertisements, the
use for the display of advertisements of any external part of
a building which is not normally used for that purpose shall

( a ) in respect of the use of the land for that other purpose
on similar occasions before 8th December 1969 ; or
( b) in respect of the use of the land for that other purpose
on similar occasions on or after that date if the land
has been used for that other purpose on at least one
similar occasion since the appointed day and before the
beginning of 1969 .
( 4 ) Where land was unoccupied on the appointed day, but
had before that day been occupied at some time on or after

occasion at least during the period of two years ending with 9th
March 1960.
(8) Where by a development order planning permission to
develop land has been granted subject to limitations, planning
permission is not required for the use of that land which (apart

contravention of the provisions of this Part of this Act or in
contravention of previous planning control .
(9) Where an enforcement notice has been served in respect
of any development of land, planning permission is not required

( 7 ) The local planning authority may at any time withdraw

provision of an enforcement notice requiring a use of land to
be discontinued shall operate as a requirement that it shall be
discontinued permanently, to the extent that it is in contraven-

of that use at any time after it has been discontinued in
compliance with the enforcement notice shall to that extent be
in contravention of the enforcement notice.
(3) Without prejudice to subsection (1) of this section, if any
development is carried out on land by way of reinstating or
restoring buildings or works which have been demolished or
altered in compliance with an enforcement notice, the notice
shall, notwithstanding that its terms are not apt for the purpose,

reinstated or restored as it applied in relation to the buildings
or works before they were demolished or altered.

the local planning authority or, under section 91 of this Act ,
by the Secretary of State) -

uses, either for all those uses or for some one or more
ofthem.

91.-(1 ) The Secretary of State may give directions requiring
applications for established use certificates to be referred to
him instead of being dealt with by local planning authorities ;
and, on any such application being referred to him in accordance
with such directions, section 90( 4) of this Act shall apply in
relation to the Secretary of State as it applies in relation to the
local planning authority in the case of an application determined
bythem.
( 2) Where an application is made to a local planning autho-
rity for an established use certificate and is refused, or is refused
in part, the applicant may by notice under this subsection appeal
to the Secretary of State ; and on any such appeal the Secretary
of State shall-
( a ) if and so far as he is satisfied that the authority's refusal
is not well- founded, grant to the appellant an estab-

subject to which a previous planning permission was granted.
( 4 ) Before determining an application or appeal under this
section the Secretary of State shall, if either the applicant or
appellant ( as the case may be) or the local planning authority
so desire, afford to each of them an opportunity of appearing
before, and being heard by, a person appointed by the Secretary
of State for the purpose.

a person required by section 92( 3) of this Act to be
served with the notice was not served, the Secretary
of State may disregard that fact if he is satisfied that
the person has not been substantially prejudiced by the
failure to serve him .

Secretary of State shall give directions for giving effect to his
determination, including, where appropriate, directions for

30th October 1958 ; and any such acquisition or sale is herein-
after referred to as an acquisition or sale to which this subsection
applies .
( 4) No such deduction as is mentioned in subsection ( 1 ) of
this section shall be made in the case of an acquisition or sale
to which subsection (3) of this section applies unless-
(a ) where it was a compulsory acquisition, an amount was

by agreement, was included in the purchase price as
mentioned in the said subsection ( 1) ( hereafter in this

section referred to as the sum paid for severance or
injurious affection ") exceeded the loss of immediate
value of the interest affected ; and
( c ) where it was a sale by agreement, the other land in
question was held with the relevant land.
(5) Subject to subsection (4) of this section, the amount to
be deducted as mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, in

section applies, shall be the amount by which the sum paid for
severance or injurious affection exceeded the loss of immediate
value of the interest affected.
( 6) The following provisions of this subsection shall have
effect, in the case of an acquisition or sale to which subsection (3)
of this section applies, where so much (if any ) of the sum paid
for severance or injurious affection as was attributable to the loss
of immediate value of the interest affected was less than the
depreciation in restricted value of that interest, that is to say-
(a ) the amount of the difference shall be ascertained ; and
( b) for the purpose of determining whether, at any time
after the acquisition or sale, the land in which the
interest affected subsisted or any part thereof had or
has an unexpended balance of established development
value (whether or not that land or any part thereof
would apart from this subsection have had an original
unexpended balance of established development value)

and a value equal to seven- eighths of the amount of
the difference shall be deemed to have subsisted
immediately after the time when the adjustment of
claim holdings was completed.
( 7 ) In this section-
" the loss of immediate value " means the amount (if any)
by which the difference in the value of the interest
affected, immediately before and immediately after the
acquisition or sale, exceeded the loss of development
value ;
" the loss of development value " means the amount (if any)
by which the value of the interest affected immediately
before the acquisition or sale, if calculated on the
assumption that, until such time as the land in which
that interest subsisted might reasonably be expected

to become ripe for new development, no use whatever
PART VII
could be made of that land, would have exceeded the
value of that interest immediately after the acquisition
or sale if calculated on the like assumption ;
" the depreciation in restricted value " means the amount
( if any ) by which the value of the interest affected,
immediately after the acquisition or sale, would have
been less than the value of that interest immediately
before the acquisition or sale, if both values were calcu-
lated on the assumption that planning permission would
not be granted for any new development of that land,
but would be granted for any development thereof other
than new development ;
" the relevant land ", in relation to an acquisition or sale,
means the land in which the interest acquired or sold
subsisted.

with any of the preceding provisions of this Part of this Act, an
amount is required to be deducted from the original unexpended
balance of that part of that land for the purpose of determining
whether it has or had an unexpended balance of established
development value at any subsequent time, then (without preju-
dice to the operation of any of the preceding provisions of
this Part of this Act with respect to any part of the land taken
separately ) the land taken as a whole shall be treated as not
having (or as not having had) any such balance at that subsequent
time.
( 2 ) Where in accordance with any of the preceding provisions
of this Part of this Act an amount is required to be deducted
from the original unexpended balance of established development
value of any land, there shall be attributed to the various parts
of that land so much of that amount as might reasonably be
expected to have been attributed thereto if the authority deter-
mining the amount had been required to apportion it between
those parts in accordance with the same principles as applied to
its determination.

July 1948 ; and
(b) specifying (subject to any outstanding claims under Part
I or Part V of the Act of 1954) the amount of that

with respect to acts or events in consequence of which, in
accordance with any of the preceding provisions of this Part of
this Act, an amount is required to be deducted from the original
unexpended balance of established development value of any
of that land.
(3) Where, at any time on or after 1st January 1955 (whether
before or after the commencement of this Act ), a notice to treat
has been served with a view to the compulsory acquisition of an
interest in land by an authority possessing compulsory purchase

land which is substantially affected by the apportion-
ment or calculation, and that objection has not been
withdrawn, subsection (5 ) of this section shall have

period been made under paragraph (a) of this sub-
section.
(6) Where, on a reference to the Lands Tribunal under this
section, it is shown that a new apportionment relates partly to the
same matters as a previous apportionment, and is consistent with
that previous apportionment in so far as it relates to those
matters, the Tribunal shall not vary the new apportionment in
such a way as to be inconsistent with the previous apportion-
ment in so far as it relates to those matters.
( 7) A certificate under subsection (3) of this section shall
be conclusive evidence of the unexpended balance shown there-

is made whereby the permission is granted, whether
unconditionally or subject to conditions ; and

to say-
( a ) the amount by which the value of that interest ( if it is
an interest subsisting only in land to which this section
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972 c. 52 1311
applies), or (if it is an interest extending to other land)
the amount by which the value of the interest in so
far as it subsists in land to which this section applies,
is depreciated by the decision ; and
( b) the amount of the unexpended balance of established
development value, immediately before the decision, of
so much of the land in which the interest subsists as is
land to which this section applies.
( 2) Land to which this section applies, in relation to a plan-
ning decision, is land which-
( a ) constitutes or forms part of the decision area ; and
( b) at the time of the decision has an unexpended balance
of established development value.
(3) If, in the case of any land to which this section applies,
compensation is payable under this Part of this Act in respect
of two or more interests in that land by reason of the same
planning decision, and the aggregate amount of compensation
payable apart from this subsection in respect of those interests
would exceed the amount mentioned in paragraph (b) of sub-
section ( 1) of this section, the amount mentioned in that para-
graph shall be allocated between those interests in proportion
to the depreciation of the value of each of them respectively.
and the amount of the compensation payable in respect of any
of those interests shall be the sum so allocated to that interest.
( 4) Where the land constituting the decision area, taken as a
whole, does not satisfy both of the following conditions, that
is to say-
( a ) that at the time of the decision it has an unexpended
balance of established development value ; and

is depreciated by the decision, subsists in the whole of
that land,
the provisions of subsection (5 ) of this section shall have effect
for the purpose of assessing the compensation payable under
this Part of this Act in respect of any interest subsisting in that
land or any part thereof.
( 5) Where this subsection applies in relation to an interest
inland-

ning decision shall first be ascertained with reference
to the whole of the land which constitutes or forms
part of the decision area and is land in which that
interest subsists ;
( b) the land referred to in paragraph (a ) of this subsection
shall then be treated as divided into as many parts

sists of land which either satisfies both of the conditions
mentioned in subsection ( 4) of this section or is not
land which, at the time of the decision, has an un-
expended balance of established development value ;
and
(c ) the depreciation of the value of the interest, ascertained
in accordance with paragraph (a ) of this subsection,
shall then be apportioned between those parts, accord-

ance with the following provisions of this section, falls short of
what that value, so calculated, would have been if the relevant
decision had been a decision to the contrary effect.

such value shall for the purposes of this section be calculated-
( a ) as at the time of the relevant decision ; but
(b) as affected by that decision, by any grant of planning
permission made after that decision and in force
immediately before the Secretary of State gives notice
of his determination on the claim for compensation in
respect of that decision, and by any undertaking to
grant planning permission so in force ; and
( c) on the assumption that, after the relevant decision, and
apart from any such permission or undertaking as is
mentioned in paragraph (b) of this subsection, plan-
ning permission would not be granted for any new
development of the land in question, but would be
granted for any development thereof other than new
development.

land which includes the whole or part of that land,
compensation to which this subsection applies has become or
becomes payable in respect of that other planning decision or
that order, the calculation to be made under this section shall
be made as if that other planning decision had been a decision
to the contrary effect , or that order had not been made, as the

( b) in relation to a decision granting the permission subject
to conditions, means a decision granting the permission
applied for subject only to such of those conditions

planning authority on whom the notice was served.

of action by the Secretary of State under this section is a reference

requirements of those provisions to which effect has not been
given at the time of that determination shall be dispensed with.

of, or forming part of, the area of a claim holding-
( a ) which was not comprised in the assignation ; but
( b) whose holder immediately before the time of completion
was the person who would, apart from the assignation, have
been liable to pay the unpaid balance of the development
charge,
then, for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule, that claim
holding shall be deemed to have been comprised in the assignation.
( 4 ) In this Part of this Schedule references to the determination
of a development charge in respect of any land are references to a
determination of the Central Land Board that the charge was payable
in respect of the carrying out of operations in, on, over or under that
land, or in respect of the use of that land.
( 5 ) For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule the amount of
adevelopment charge-
( a ) in a case where the Central Land Board determined that
amount as a single capital payment, shall be taken to
have been the amount of that payment ; and
Section 127 .
1466 c. 52
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972
SCH. 13 ( b ) in a case where the Board determined that amount other-
wise than as a single capital payment, shall be taken to
have been the amount of the single capital payment which
would have been payable if the Board had determined the
amount as such a payment ;
and references in this Part of this Schedule to the unpaid balance
of a development charge are references to the amount of the
charge, if no sum was actually paid to the Board on account of
the charge, or if any sum was so paid, are references to the amount
of the charge reduced by the amount or aggregate amount of the
sum or sums so paid, other than any sum paid by way of interest.
( 6 ) In relation to the assignation of a claim holding to the Central
Land Board, references in this Part of this Schedule to a develop-
ment charge covered by the assignation are references to a develop-
ment charge the payment of which was secured, or partly secured by,
the assignation, or, as the case may be, which was agreed to be set
off against any payment which might become payable by reference
to that claim holding.
2.- (1 ) Where a claim holding was assigned to the Central Land
Board in accordance with the special arrangements relating to owners
of single house plots, that claim holding shall, subject to sub-
paragraph ( 2) of this paragraph, be deemed to have been extinguished
as from the time when it was assigned to the Board.
( 2) Where a claim holding ( in this sub-paragraph referred to as
" the original holding ") was assigned as mentioned in sub-paragraph
(1) of this paragraph but was so assigned by reference to a plot of
land which did not extend to the whole of the area of the original
holding, that sub-paragraph shall not apply, but there shall be
deemed to have been substituted for the original holding, as from
the time of the assignation, a claim holding with an area consisting
of so much of the area of the original holding as was not comprised
in that plot of land, and with a value equal to that fraction of
the value of the original holding which then attached to so much
of the area of the original holding as was not comprised in that
plot .
3. Without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Schedule, where an
assignation to the Central Land Board comprised one or more claim
holdings, and the unpaid balance of the development charge covered
by the assignation, or (if more than one) the aggregate of the unpaid
balances of the development charges so covered, was equal to or
greater than the value of the claim holding, or the aggregate value
of the claim holdings, as the case may be, the holding or holdings
shall be deemed to have been extinguished as from the time of the
assignation .
4. Where an assignation to the Central Land Board comprised only
a single claim holding with an area of which every part either con-
sisted of, or formed part of , the land in respect of which some
development charge covered by the assignation was determined, and
paragraph 3 of this Schedule does not apply, the value of that claim
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972 c. 52 1467
holding shall be deemed to have been reduced, as from the time of
the assignation, by the unpaid balance of the development charge
covered by the assignation, or (if more than one) by the aggregate of
the unpaid balances of all the development charges covered by the
assignation .
5.- (1) The provisions of this paragraph shall have effect in the
case of an assignation of one or more claim holdings to the Central
Land Board to which neither paragraph 3 nor paragraph 4 of this
Schedule applies.
( 2) Any claim holding comprised in the assignation with an area
of which every part either consisted of, or formed part of, the land
in respect of which some development charge covered by the assigna-
tion was determined shall be allocated to the development charge in
question, or ( if more than one) to those development charges
collectively .
( 3) Any claim holding comprised in the assignation with an area
part of which did, and part of which did not, consist of, or form
part of, such land as is mentioned in sub-paragraph ( 2) of this
paragraph shall be treated as if , at the time of the assignation, the
claim holding ( in this sub-paragraph referred to as the parent
holding ") had been divided into two separate claim holdings, that
is to say-
( a ) a claim holding with an area consisting of so much of
the area of the parent holding as consisted of , or formed
part of , such land as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (2)
of this paragraph, and with a value equal to that fraction
of the value of the parent holding which then attached to
that part of the area of the parent holding ; and
( b ) a claim holding with an area consisting of the residue of
the area of the parent holding, and with a value equal
to that fraction of the value of the parent holding which
then attached to the residue of the area of the parent
holding ,
and the claim holding referred to in head (a ) of this sub-paragraph
shall be allocated to the development charge in question, or (if more
than one ) to those development charges collectively.
( 4 ) Paragraph 3 or paragraph 4 of this Schedule shall then apply
in relation to each claim holding (if any ) allocated in accordance
with sub -paragraph ( 2 ) or sub-paragraph ( 3) of this paragraph to
any development charge, or to any development charges collectively,
as if the assignation had comprised only that claim holding and had
covered only that development charge or those development charges .
( 5 ) If, after the application of the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph, there remains outstanding any claim holding not
allocated in accordance with those provisions, or any claim holding
which ( having been so allocated ) is deemed to have been reduced
in value but not extinguished, an amount equal to the aggregate of-
( a ) the unpaid balance of any development charge covered by
the assignation to which no claim holding was so allocated ;
and
SCH. 13
1468 c. 52
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972
SCH. 13 ( b) the amount ( if any) by which the value of any claim holding
so allocated which is deemed to have been extinguished
falls short of the unpaid balance of the development charge,
or the aggregate of the unpaid balances of the development
charges, to which it was so allocated.
shall be treated as having been deducted from the value of the
claim holding so remaining outstanding, or (if more than one) as
having been deducted rateably from the respective values of those
claim holdings, and the value of any such holding shall be deemed
to have been reduced accordingly as from the time of the assignation.
PART II
ADJUSTMENT BY REFERENCE TO PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF
WAR-DAMAGED LAND
6.- (1) The provisions of this Part of this Schedule shall have
effect where a payment under the scheme has become, or becomes
payable in respect of an interest in land, and a claim holding
related ( or would , apart from this Part of this Schedule, have
related ) to the like interest in the whole or part of that land, with
or without any other land.
"
( 2 ) In this Part of this Schedule " the scheme means the scheme
made under section 56 of the Act of 1947, " the date of the
scheme " means 23rd December 1949, and payment under the
scheme " means a payment which has become, or becomes, payable
by virtue of the scheme.
( 3) In relation to any payment under the scheme " the payment
area ", in this Part of this Schedule, means the land in respect of
which the payment became or becomes payable, and references
to the amount of the payment shall be construed as references to
the principal amount thereof , excluding any interest payable there-
on in accordance with section 62( 3) of the Act of 1947.
7. If the payment area is identical with the area of the claim
holding, then-
( a ) in the case of a payment of an amount equal to the value
of the claim holding , the claim holding shall be deemed to
have been extinguished as from the date of the scheme ;
( b ) in the case of a payment of an amount less than the value
of the claim holding, the value of the claim holding shall
be deemed to have been reduced, as from the date of the
scheme, by the amount of the payment.
8.(1) If the payment area forms part of the area of the claim
holding, the holding (in this paragraph referred to as " the parent
holding " ) shall be treated, as from the date of the scheme, as
having been divided into two claim holdings, that is to say-
( a ) a claim holding with an area consisting of that part of the
area of the parent holding which constituted the payment
area, and with a value equal to that fraction of the value
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972 c. 52 1469
of the parent holding which attached to that part of the
area of the parent holding ; and
( b ) a claim holding with an area consisting of the residue of
the area of the parent holding, and with a value equal to
that fraction of the value of the parent holding which
attached to the residue of the area of the parent holding.
(2) Where sub-paragraph (1 ) of this paragraph applies, paragraph
7 of this Schedule shall have effect in relation to the claim holding
referred to in sub- paragraph (1 ) (a ) of this paragraph as if it were the
parentholding.
9. If the payment area includes the area of the claim holding
together with other land, paragraph 7 of this Schedule shall apply
asif-
( a ) the payment area had been identical with the area of the
claim holding ; but
( b ) the amount of the payment had been so much of the actual
amount thereof, as might reasonably be expected to have
been attributed to the area of the claim holding if , under
the scheme, the authority determining the amount of the
payment had been required ( in accordance with the same
principles as applied to the determination of that amount )
to apportion it between the area of the claim holding and the
rest of the payment area.
10. If the payment area includes part of the area of the claim
holding together with other land not comprised in the area of the
claim holding-
( a ) paragraph 8 of this Schedule shall apply as if the part of the
payment area comprised in the area of the claim holding
had been the whole of the payment area ; and
(b ) paragraph 9 of this Schedule shall apply as if the part of
the area of the claim holding comprised in the payment
area had been the whole of the area of the claim holding .
SCH. 13
PART III
ADJUSTMENT IN CASES OF PARTIAL TRANSMISSION OF
CLAIM HOLDINGS
11. The provisions of this Part of this Schedule shall have effect
where, by virtue of a transmission of part of the benefit of an estab-
lished claim (in this Part of this Schedule referred to as " the relevant
transmission "), different persons became entitled to different parts of
the benefit of that established claim .
12. As from the date of the relevant transmission, each of those
different parts shall be treated as having constituted aseparate claim
holding .
1470 c. 52
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972
SCH. 13 13. The area and value of any such separate claim holding at any
time after the relevant transmission shall be taken to have been such
as may, in the requisite manner, be or have been determined to be
just and appropriate in all the circumstances .
14. In paragraph 13 of this Schedule the reference to determination
in the requisite manner of the area and value of a claim holding is
a reference to the determination thereof on the occasion of an
apportionment affecting that holding which fell or falls to be made
for any of the purposes of the Act of 1954, of Part VII of this Act or
of this Schedule, being a determination made-
( a ) by the authority making that apportionment ; or
( b) where, under the Act of 1954 or Part VII of this Act, that
authority's findings were or are referred to the Lands
Tribunal, by that Tribunal,
having regard in particular to the principles mentioned in paragraph
15 of this Schedule.
15.- (1) The said principles are those set out in the following
provisions of this paragraph.
( 2) The aggregate of the values of all claim holdings representing
parts of the benefit of the same established claim must not exceed
the amount of the established claim.
( 3) Subject to sub-paragraph ( 2) of this paragraph, where a claim
holding representing part only of the benefit of an established claim
was assigned to the Central Land Board, otherwise than as mentioned
in paragraph 2 of this Schedule, and by virtue of Part I of this
Schedule the value of that claim holding is deemed to have been
reduced by reference to an amount due by way of development
charge, the value of that holding at the time of the assignation is not
to be taken to have been less than the amount secured by the
assignation.
( 4 ) In the case of the claim holding representing the part of the
benefit of an established claim which was the subject of the relevant
transmission, if it was not a claim holding to which sub-paragraph (5)
of this paragraph applies-
( a ) the area of that claim holding is to be taken to be the claim
area of that established claim, less the area of any claim
holding to which the said sub-paragraph ( 5) applies which
represents part of the benefit of the same established claim ;
and
( b) the value of the claim holding immediately after the relevant
transmission is, subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and ( 3) of
this paragraph , to be taken to have been that part of the
amount of the established claim to which the holder pur-
ported to become entitled under the terms of the relevant
transmission.
( 5) Where any person who was entitled to a claim holding repre-
senting part only of the benefit of an established claim-
( a ) at any time while so entitled was also entitled to the interest
in land to which the established claim related in so far as
that interest subsisted in part only of the claim area ; and
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972 c. 52 1471
( b) became entitled to both that holding and that interest in
such circumstances that the authority making the apportion-
ment in question or the Lands Tribunal, as the case may
be, were or are satisfied that the holding and the interest
were intended to relate to one another,
the area of that claim holding is to be taken to be that part of the
claim area, and the value of the holding immediately after the
relevant transmission (however that or any other transmission affecting
the holding was expressed , but subject to sub-paragraphs (2) to ( 4)
of this paragraph ) is to be taken to have been an amount equal to
so much of the amount of the established claim as might reasonably
be expected to have been attributed to that part of the claim area if
the authority determining the amount of that established claim had
been required to apportion it, in accordance with the same principles
as applied to its determination, between that part and the residue
of the claim area.
16. Paragraph 1 of this Schedule shall apply for the purposes of
this Part of this Schedule as it applies for the purposes of Part I
thereof .
PART IV
ADJUSTMENT IN RESPECT OF PAYMENTS UNDER PART I OF
ACT OF 1954
17. The provisions of this Part of this Schedule shall have effect
where, by virtue of Part I of the Act of 1954, a payment became
or becomes payable in respect of a claim holding.
18. Subject to the following provisions of this Part of this Schedule ,
if either-
( a ) the principal amount of the payment was or is not less than
the value of the claim holding ; or
( b ) the payment ( whatever its amount ) became or becomes pay-
able under Case D (that is to say, by virtue of section 8
of the Act of 1954, which related to cases where a claim
holding had been assigned for valuable consideration),
the claim holding shall be deemed to have been extinguished ; and
if the principal amount of the payment (not being a payment under
Case D ) was or is less than the value of the claim holding, the value
of that holding shall be deemed to have been reduced by the principal
amount of the payment.
19. Paragraph 18 of this Schedule shall apply where two or more
payments under Part I of the Act of 1954 were or are payable in
respect of the same claim holding, with the substitution, for references
to the principal amount of the payment, of references to the aggre-
gate of the principal amounts of the payments .
20.- (1 ) Where one or more relevant acts or events have occurred
in relation to a claim holding ( in this paragraph referred to as " the
parent holding ") and any such act or event did not extend to the
whole of the area of the parent holding, then, for the purposes of the
SCH. 13
1472 c. 52
Town and Country Planning ( Scotland ) Act 1972
SCH. 13 preceding provisions of this Part of this Schedule, and for the pur-
poses of Part V of this Schedule and of Part VII of this Act-
( a ) the parent holding shall be treated as having been divided
immediately before the time of completion, into as many
separate claim holdings, with such areas, as may be neces-
sary to ensure that , in the case of each holding, either any
relevant act or event extending to the area of that holding
extended to the whole thereof or no relevant act or event
extended to the area of that holding ;
( b) the value of each of the separate holdings respectively shall
be taken to have been that fraction of the value of the
parent holding which then attached to the part of the area
of the parent holding constituting the area of the separate
holding ; and
( c ) the portion of the amount of any payment under Part I of
the Act of 1954 which, by the authority determining that
amount, was or is apportioned to the area of any of the
separate claim holdings shall be taken to have been a
payment payable under the said Part I in respect of that
claim holding.
( 2 ) In this paragraph " relevant act or event ", in relation to a
claim holding, means an act or event whereby, in accordance with
the provisions of Part I of the Act of 1954, one or more payments
became or become payable in respect of that claim holding.
21. For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule-
( a ) a payment shall be treated as having become payable not-
withstanding that the right to receive the payment was
extinguished by section 14( 2 ) of the Act of 1954 ( which
enabled the Central Land Board to set off payments against
liabilities in respect of development charges) ;
( b) any reduction of the principal amount of a payment by
virtue of that subsection shall be disregarded ; and
( c ) where in accordance with subsection ( 3) of section 14 of the
Act of 1954 (which provided for cases of failure to apply for
a payment within the appropriate period ) an amount was
determined as being the principal amount of a payment to
which a person would have been entitled as mentioned in
that subsection, that payment shall be treated as if it had
become due and as if the principal amount thereof had been
the amount so determined.
22.- (1 ) Where in accordance with the preceding provisions of this
Part of this Schedule a claim holding is deemed to have been ex-
tinguished or the value of a claim holding is deemed to have been
reduced, the extinguishment or reduction, as the case may be, shall
be deemed to have had effect immediately before the time of
completion.
( 2 ) References in this Part of this Schedule to the value of a
claim holding are references to the value thereof immediately before
the time of completion.
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972 c. 52 1473
PART V
ADJUSTMENT IN RESPECT OF COMPENSATION UNDER PART V OF ACT
OF 1954
23. Where compensation under Part V of the Act of 1954 became
or becomes payable by reference to a claim holding, then ( subject
to the following provisions of this Part of this Schedule ) for the
purposes of Part VII of this Act-
( a ) if the principal amount of the compensation was or is equal
to the value of the claim holding at the time of completion
(ascertained apart from this Part of this Schedule) the claim
holding shall be deemed to have been extinguished imme-
diately before that time ;
( b ) if the principal amount of the compensation was or is less
than the value of the claim holding at that time ( ascer-
tained apart from this Part of this Schedule ) the value
of the claim holding shall be deemed to have been reduced
immediately before that time by the principal amount of
the compensation.
24. Where compensation became or becomes payable as men-
tioned in paragraph 23 of this Schedule, and at any time an amount
became or becomes recoverable in respect thereof under section
30 of the Act of 1954, as applied by section 48 of that Act, or under
section 148 of this Act as applied by Schedule 22 to this Act
to compensation under Part V of the Act of 1954, then, for
the purposes of Part VII of this Act, paragraph 23 of this Schedule
shall have effect as from that time as if the principal amount of that
compensation had been reduced by a sum equal to seven-eighths of
the amount which so became or becomes recoverable .
25. Where, in the case of a claim holding ( in this paragraph
referred to as " the parent holding " ), compensation under Part V
of the Act of 1954 became or becomes payable in respect of deprecia-
tion of the value of an interest in land by one or more planning
decisions or orders, and any such decision or order did not extend
to the whole of the area of the parent holding, then, both for the
purposes of the foregoing provisions of this Part of this Schedule
and for the purposes of Part VII of this Act-
( a ) the parent holding shall be treated as having been divided
immediately before the time of completion into as many
separate claim holdings, with such areas, as may be neces-
sary to ensure that , in the case of each holding, either any
such decision or order extending to the area of that holding
extended to the whole thereof or no such decision or order
extended to the area of that holding ;
( b ) the value of each of the separate holdings respectively shall
be taken to have been that fraction of the value of the
parent holding which then attached to the part of the area
of the parent holding constituting the area of the separate
holding; and
SCH . 13
1474 c. 52
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972
SCH. 13 ( c ) the portion of the amount of any such compensation which,
by the authority determining that amount, was or is appor-
tioned to the area of any of the separate claim holdings
shall be taken to have been compensation payable under
Part V of the Act of 1954 in respect of that claim holding.
PART VI
SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS
26. Where in accordance with any of the provisions of this
Schedule a part of the benefit of an established claim constitutes a
separate claim holding, the interest in land to which that claim hold-
ing relates shall be taken to be an interest of the like character as
the interest to which the established claim related.
27. Where in accordance with any of the provisions of this Schedule
a claim holding ( in this paragraph referred to as " the parent
holding ") is to be treated as divided into two or more claim holdings,
a person who was the holder of one of those holdings shall be treated
as having been the holder thereof at any time when he was the holder
of the parent holding.
28. Expressions used in this Schedule and in Part VII of this Act
have the same meanings in this Schedule as in that Part of this Act.
29. In this Schedule " the holder ", in relation to a claim holding,
means the person for the time being entitled to the holding, and " the
time of completion " means the time when, in accordance with section
127 of this Act, the adjustment of claim holdings is deemed to have
beencompleted.
Section 130 . SCHEDULE 14
CALCULATION OF VALUE OF PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF LAND
1. Where for the purposes of section 130 of this Act the value
of any development initiated before a time referred to in that section
has to be ascertained with reference to that time, the value of the
development shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions
of this Schedule.
2. Subject to the following provisions of this Schedule, the value
shall be calculated by reference to prices current at the time in
question-
(a ) as if the development had not been initiated, but the land
had remained in the state in which it was immediately before
the development was initiated ; and
( b) on the assumption that (apart from the provisions of Part
III of this Act or the provisions of the Act of 1947, as the
case may be) the development could at that time lawfully be
carried out,
and shall be taken to be the difference between the value which
in those circumstances the land would have had at that time if
Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972 c. 52 1475
planning permission for that development had been granted uncon-
ditionally immediately before that time and the value which in those
circumstances the land would have had at that time if planning
permission for that development had been applied for and refused
immediately before that time, and it could be assumed that planning
permission for that development, and any other new development of
that land, would be refused on any subsequent application.
3. If the development involved the clearing of any land, the
reference in paragraph ( 2)(a ) of this Schedule to the state of the land
immediately before the development shall be construed as a reference
to the state of the land immediately after the clearing thereof but
before the carrying out of any other operations .
4 .- (1) If the development was initiated in pursuance of planning
permission granted subject to conditions, paragraph 2 of this Schedule
shall apply as if the reference to the granting of permission uncon-
ditionally were a reference to the granting of permission subject to
the like conditions.
( 2 ) If the permission referred to in sub-paragraph (1 ) of this
paragraph was granted subject to conditions which consisted of , or
included, a requirement expressed by reference to a specified period,
the reference in that sub- paragraph to the like conditions shall be
construed , in relation to the condition imposing that requirement, as
a reference to a condition imposing the like requirement in respect
of a period of like duration beginning at the time in question.
5. In the application of the foregoing provisions of this Schedule
to development initiated, but not completed, before the time in
question, references to permission for that development shall be
construed as references to permission for so much of that develop-
ment as had been carried out before that time.

DEVELOPMENT VALUE
Determination of relevant area
1.- (1) Where, in the case of a compulsory acquisition to which
section 131 of this Act applies, any area of the relevant land
which, immediately before the relevant date, has an unexpended
balance of established development value does not satisfy the con-
dition set out in sub- paragraph ( 2) of this paragraph, that area shall
be treated as divided into as many separate areas as may be requisite
to ensure that each of those separate areas satisfies that condition.
( 2 ) The condition referred to in sub- paragraph (1) of this para-
graph is that all the interests ( other than excepted interests) subsist-
ing in the area in question subsist in the whole of that area.
Section 131 .

SCH. 15 ( 3) Any area of the relevant land which has an unexpended
balance of established development value and which complies with
the condition set out in sub-paragraph ( 2 ) of this paragraph is in this
Schedule referred to, in relation to the interests subsisting therein,
as
"the relevant area ", and the subsequent provisions of this
Schedule shall have effect separately in relation to each relevant
area.
Preliminary calculations
2. In the case of the interest of the lessor under any lease, there
shall be calculated the capital value, as at the time immediately
before the relevant date, of the right to receive a sum equal to the
unexpended balance of established development value of the rele-
vant area at that time, but payable at the expiration of the lease ;
and the amount so calculated in the case of any such interest
is in this Schedule referred to as " the reversionary development
value " of that interest.
Apportionment of unexpended balance between interests
3. Where two or more interests (other than excepted interests )
subsist in the relevant area, the portion of the unexpended balance
of established development value of the relevant area attributable
to each of those interests respectively shall be taken to be the
following, that is to say-
( a ) in the case of the interest of the lessor under any lease,
so much, if any, of the reversionary development value of
that interest, as remains after the deduction therefrom of
the aggregate of-
(i ) the reversionary development value of the interest
of the person, if any, to whom that lessor stands in the
relationship of lessee ; and
(ii ) in a case where the restricted value of the first-
mentioned interest is a minus quantity, an amount equal
to that minus quantity ;
( b ) in the case of the interest of the lessee under any lease
which is not subject to a sub-lease, so much, if any, of the
said balance as remains after the deduction therefrom of
the aggregate of-
(i ) the reversionary development value of the interest
of the lessor under the lease, and
( ii ) in a case where the restricted value of the first-
mentioned interest is a minus quantity, an amount equal
to that minus quantity .
Application of Schedule to past acquisitions
4. In relation to any compulsory acquisition to which section
131 of this Act applies, where the relevant date was a date before
the commencement of this Act , the foregoing provisions of this
Schedule shall have effect with the necessary modifications.

the interest of the lessee is an excepted interest ;
"
( c ) " the relevant date " and excepted interest " have the

ALTERATIONS
1. Where the building to be rebuilt or altered is the original
building, the amount of gross floor space in the building as rebuilt
or altered which may be used for any purpose shall not exceed by
more than ten per cent. the amount of gross floor space which was
last used for that purpose in the original building .
2. Where the building to be rebuilt or altered is not the original
building, the amount of gross floor space in the building as rebuilt
or altered which may be used for any purpose shall not exceed the
amount of gross floor space which was last used for that purpose in
the building before the rebuilding or alteration .
3. In determining under this Schedule the purpose for which floor
space was last used in any building, no account shall be taken of
any use in respect of which an effective enforcement notice has been
or could be served or, in the case of a use which has been discon-
tinued , could have been served immediately before the discontinu-
ance.
4. For the purposes of this Schedule gross floor space shall be
ascertained by external measurement ; and where different parts
of a building are used for different purposes, floor space common
to those purposes shall be apportioned rateably .
5. In relation to a building erected after the appointed day, being
a building resulting from the carrying out of any such works as are
described in paragraph 1 of Schedule 6 to this Act, any reference in
this Schedule to the original building is a reference to the building
in relation to which those works were carried out and not to the
building resulting from the carrying out of those works.

PROCEEDINGS ON LISTED BUILDING PURCHASE NOTICE
Action by local planning authority onwhom listed building
purchase notice is served
1.- (1 ) The local planning authority on whom a listed building
purchase notice is served, shall, before the end of the period of
three months beginning with the date of service of that notice, serve
on the owner or lessee by whom the purchase notice was served
a notice stating either-
( a ) that the authority are willing to comply with the purchase
notice ; or
(b ) that another local planning authority or statutory under-
takers specified in the notice under this sub-paragraph have
agreed to comply with it in their place ; or
( c ) that for reasons specified in the notice under this sub-para-
graph, the authority are not willing to comply with the
purchase notice and have not found any other local plan-
ning authority or statutory undertakers who will agree to
comply with it in their place and that they have trans-
mitted a copy of the purchase notice to the Secretary of
State, on a date specified in the notice under this sub-
paragraph, together with a statement of the reasons so
specified .
( 2) Where the local planning authority on whom a listed building
purchase notice is served by an owner or lessee have served on him
a notice in accordance with sub- paragraph ( 1) (a) or (b) of this para-
graph the authority, or the other local planning authority or statutory
undertakers specified in the notice, as the case may be, shall be
deemed to be authorised to acquire the interest of the owner or
lessee compulsorily in accordance with the provisions of section 104
of this Act, and to have served a notice to treat in respect thereof
on the date of service of the notice under sub-paragraph (1) of
this paragraph.
(3) Where the authority on whom a listed building purchase notice
is served by an owner or lessee propose to serve on him a notice
in accordance with sub-paragraph ( 1)(c) of this paragraph they shall
transmit a copy of the purchase notice to the Secretary of State
together with a statement of their reasons ; and section 171 of this
Act shall then apply in relation to the purchase notice as it applies
in relation to a purchase notice under section 169 of this Act with
the substitution for references therein to the Secretary of State
taking action under section 172 of this Act of references to his
taking action under paragraph 2 of this Schedule.
Action by Secretary of State in relation to listed building purchase
notice
2.- (1 ) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph , if
the Secretary of State is satisfied that the conditions specified in
Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972 c. 52 1479
section 179(1) (a ) to (c ) of this Act are fulfilled in relation to a listed
building purchase notice, he shall confirm the notice :
Provided that, if he is satisfied that the said conditions are fulfilled
only in respect of part of the land, he shall confirm the notice only
in respect of that part and the notice shall have effect accordingly.
( 2) The Secretary of State shall not confirm the purchase notice
unless he is satisfied that the land comprises such land contiguous or
adjacent to the building as is in his opinion required for preserving
the building or its amenities, or for affording access to it, or for its
proper control or management.
( 3) If it appears to the Secretary of State to be expedient to do so
in the case of a listed building purchase notice served on account of
listed building consent being refused or granted subject to conditions,
he may, in lieu of confirming the purchase notice, grant listed building
consent for the works in respect of which the application was made
or, where such consent for those works was granted subject to
conditions, revoke or amend those conditions so far as it appears
to him to be required in order to enable the land to be rendered
capable of reasonably beneficial use by the carrying out of those
works.
( 4 ) If it appears to the Secretary of State to be expedient to do so,
in the case of a listed building purchase notice served on account of
listed building consent being revoked or modified by an order under
Part II of Schedule 10 to this Act, he may, in lieu of confirming the
notice, cancel the order revoking the consent or, where the order
modified the consent by the imposition of conditions, revoke or
amend those conditions so far as appears to him to be required in
order to enable the land to be rendered capable of reasonably bene-
ficial use by the carrying out of the works in respect of which the
consent was granted.
( 5 ) If it appears to the Secretary of State that the land, or any part
of it , could be rendered capable of reasonably beneficial use within a
reasonable time by the carrying out of any other works for which
listed building consent ought to be granted, he may in lieu of con-
firming the listed building purchase notice or in lieu of confirming
it so far as it relates to that part of the land, as the case may be, direct
that listed building consent for those works shall be granted in the
event of an application being made in that behalf.
( 6 ) If it appears to the Secretary of State that the land, or any part
of the land, could be rendered capable of reasonably beneficial use
within a reasonable time by the carrying out of any development for
which planning permission ought to be granted, he may, in lieu of
confirming the listed building purchase notice, or in lieu of confirming
it so far as it relates to that part of the land, as the case may be, direct
that planning permission for that development shall be granted in the
event of an application being made in that behalf.
( 7 ) If it appears to the Secretary of State, having regard to the
probable ultimate use of the building or the site thereof, that it is
expedient to do so, he may, if he confirms the notice, modify it either
in relation to the whole or in relation to any part of the land, by
substituting another local planning authority or statutory undertakers
for the authority on whom the notice was served.
SCH. 17
1480 c. 52 Town and Country Planning ( Scotland) Act 1972
SCH. 17 ( 8) In section 171 of this Act as applied by paragraph 1( 3) of this
Schedule, any reference to the taking of action by the Secretary of
State under this paragraph is a reference to the taking by him of any
such action as is mentioned in sub-paragraphs (1) or ( 3) to ( 7) of this
paragraph, or to the taking by him of a decision not to confirm the
purchase notice on the grounds that any of the conditions referred to
in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph are not fulfilled.
Effect of Secretary of State's action in relation to listed building
purchase notice
3.- (1 ) Where the Secretary of State confirms a listed building
purchase notice, the authority on whom the notice was served ( or, if
under paragraph 2( 7) of this Schedule the Secretary of State modified
the notice by substituting another authority or statutory under-
takers for that authority, that other authority or those statutory
undertakers) shall be deemed to be authorised to acquire the relevant
interest compulsorily in accordance with the provisions of section 104
of this Act and to have served a notice to treat in respect thereof
on such date as the Secretary of State may direct.
( 2 ) If, before the end of the relevant period, the Secretary of State
has neither confirmed the purchase notice nor taken any such action
in respect thereof as is mentioned in sub-paragraphs ( 3) to (6) of
paragraph 2 of this Schedule, and has not notified the owner or
lessee by whom the notice was served that he does not propose to
confirm the notice, the notice shall be deemed to be confirmed at
the end of that period and the authority on whom the notice was
served shall be deemed to have been authorised to acquire the
relevant interest compulsorily in accordance with the provisions of
section 104 of this Act and to have served a notice to treat in respect
thereof at the end of that period.
( 3) In this paragraph-
( a ) " the relevant interest " means the owner's or lessee's interest
in the land or, if the purchase notice is confirmed by the
Secretary of State in respect of only part of the land, the
owner's or lessee's interest in that part ;
( b ) " the relevant period " is whichever of the following periods
first expires, that is to say-
(i ) the period of nine months beginning with the date
of the service of the purchase notice ; and
(ii ) the period of six months beginning with the date
on which a copy of the purchase notice was transmitted
to the Secretary of State.
( 4 ) Where the Secretary of State has notified the owner or lessee
by whom a listed building purchase notice has been served of a
decision on his part to confirm, or not to confirm, the notice (includ-
ing any decision to confirm the notice only in respect of part of the
land, or to give any direction as to the granting of listed building
consent ) and that decision of the Secretary of State is quashed under
the provisions of Part XII of this Act, the purchase notice shall be
treated as cancelled, but the owner or lessee may serve a further
listed building purchase notice in its place.
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972 c. 52 1481
( 5 ) For the purposes of any regulations made under this Act as
to the time within which a listed building purchase notice may be
served, the service of a listed building purchase notice under sub-
paragraph ( 4 ) of this paragraph shall not be treated as out of time
if the notice is served within the period which would be applicable
in accordance with those regulations if the decision to refuse listed
building consent or to grant it subject to conditions ( being the decision
in consequence of which the notice is served ) had been made on
the date on which the decision of the Secretary of State was quashed
as mentioned in sub-paragraph ( 4) of this paragraph.
Special provision as to compensation where listed building
purchase notice served
4. Where in consequence of listed building consent being revoked
or modified by an order under Part II of Schedule 10 to this Act,
compensation is payable by virtue of section 161 of this Act in
respect of expenditure incurred in carrying out any works to the
building in respect of which the consent was granted, then if a listed
building purchase notice is served in respect of an interest in the
land , any compensation payable in respect of the acquisition of that
interest in pursuance of the notice shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the value of the works in respect of which compensation
is payable by virtue of that section.

( b) by serving a like notice on-
(i) every owner, occupier and lessee ( except tenants
for a month or a period less than a month and statutory
tenants within the meaning of the Rent ( Scotland ) Act
1971) of any of that land ;
(ii ) every county or town council whose area includes
any of that land ;

199( 2 )( d ) of this Act ; and
( c ) by causing a copy of the notice to be displayed in a
prominent position at the ends of so much of any footpath
or bridleway as is to be stopped up, diverted or

( 3 ) Except in the case of an owner, occupier or lessee being
a local authority or statutory undertakers, the Secretary of State may
in any particular case direct that it shall not be necessary to comply
with sub-paragraph (2)(b)(i) of this paragraph ; but if he so directs in
the case of any land, then in addition to publication the notice shall
be addressed to " the owners and any occupiers " of the land
( describing it ) and a copy or copies of the notice shall be affixed to
some conspicuous object or objects on the land .
2. If no representations or objections are duly made, or if any so
made are withdrawn, the authority by whom the order was made
may, instead of submitting the order to the Secretary of State .
themselves confirm the order ( but without any modification ).
3.- (1) If any representation or objection duly made is not with-
drawn, the Secretary of State shall, before confirming the order, if
the objection is made by a local authority, cause a local inquiry to
be held, and in any other case either-
( a ) cause a local inquiry to be held ; or
( b ) afford to any person by whom any representation or objection
has been duly made and not withdrawn an opportunity of
being heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State
for the purpose,
and, after considering the report of the person appointed to hold
the inquiry or to hear representations or objections, may confirm
the order, with or without modifications :
Provided that in the case of an order under section 199 of this
Act, if objection is made by statutory undertakers on the ground that
the order provides for the creation of a public right of way over land
covered by works used for the purpose of their undertaking, or over
the curtilage of such land, and the objection is not withdrawn, the
order shall be subject to special parliamentary procedure.
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972 c. 52 1483
( 2 ) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph, the Secretary of State shall not confirm an order so as to
affect land not affected by the order as submitted to him, except
after-
( a ) giving such notice as appears to him requisite of his proposal

than twenty-eight days from the date of the first publication
of the notice) within which, and the manner in which,
representations or objections with respect to the proposal
may be made ;
( b) holding a local inquiry or affording to any person by whom
any representation or objection has been duly made and
not withdrawn an opportunity of being heard by a person
appointed by the Secretary of State for the purpose ; and
( c ) considering the report of the person appointed to hold the
inquiry or to hear representations or objections as the case
may be ;
and, in the case of an order under section 199 of this Act, if objection
is made by statutory undertakers on the ground that the order as
modified would provide for the creation of a public right of way over
land covered by works used for the purposes of their undertaking,
or over the curtilage of such land, and the objection is not with-
drawn, the order shall be subject to special parliamentary procedure.
4.- (1) The Secretary of State shall not confirm an order under
section 199 of this Act which extinguishes a right of way over land
under, in, on, over, along or across which there is any apparatus
belonging to or used by statutory undertakers for the purposes of
their undertaking, unless the undertakers have consented to the
confirmation of the order ; and any such consent may be given subject
to the condition that there are included in the order such provisions
for the protection of the undertakers as they may reasonably require.
( 2) The consent of statutory undertakers to any such order shall
not be unreasonably withheld ; and any question arising under this
paragraph whether the withholding of consent is unreasonable, or
whether any requirement is reasonable, shall be determined by which-
ever Minister is the appropriate Minister in relation to the statutory
undertakers concerned.
5. Regulations under this Act may, subject to this Part of this
Schedule, make such provision as the Secretary of State thinks
expedient as to the procedure on the making, submission and con-
firmation of orders under sections 199 and 203(1)( b) of this Act.
PART II
PUBLICITY FOR ORDERS AFTER CONFIRMATION

schemes made under the Town and Country Planning 1932 c. 49.
( Scotland ) Act 1932 and the Town Planning (Scotland ) Act 1925 c. 17.
1925) in so far as, by virtue of that paragraph, the scheme
continued to have effect immediately before the commence-
ment of this Act ; or
( b ) any order made under that paragraph ( which empowered
the Minister to make provision by order for winding up
any such scheme ) in so far as the order continued to have
effect immediately before the commencement of this Act .
( 2) Any power to make orders under paragraph 6 of that Schedule
shall continue to be exercisable notwithstanding the said repeal.
75.-- (1) The repeal effected by this Act shall not affect the

SCH. 22
1932 с. 49.
agreements made before the appointed day for restricting the
planning, development or use of land ), or of any order discharging
or modifying a restriction imposed by such an agreement, in so far
as any such agreement or order was in force immediately before
the commencement of this Act ; and any such agreement may be
enforced as if this Act had not been passed.
(2) Nothing in any such agreement shall be construed as restricting
the exercise, in relation to land to which the agreement applies, of

so long as those powers are exercised in accordance with the
provisions of the development plan, or in accordance with any
directions which may have been given by the Secretary of State by
virtue of paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 to this Act, or as requiring the
exercise of any such powers otherwise than in accordance with such
provisions or directions .

by any person being a party to any such agreement, or a person
entitled to land affected thereby, that any restriction on the develop-
ment or use of the land imposed by the agreement is inconsistent
with the proper planning or development of the area comprising the

any person being a party to any such agreement ( whether as originally
made or as modified under that sub-paragraph) , or a person entitled
to land affected thereby, claims that the agreement ought to be
modified or rescinded, having regard to the provisions of this Act

may refer to arbitration the question whether the agreement should
be so modified or rescinded, and the arbiter may make such award
as appears to him to be just having regard to all the circumstances .

enactment repealed by that Act ) or under an order made under
section 10(1) of that Act ( in the subsequent provisions of this
Schedule referred to as " a planning scheme " and " an interim
development order ") the provisions of Parts III and V of this Act,
the provisions of Part IX of this Act relating to purchase notices ,

this paragraph, where any such permission was granted subject
to conditions (in whatever form) restricting the period for which
the works or use might be continued on the land, then, if that
period had not expired at the appointed day and the works were
or are not removed, or the use discontinued, at the end of that
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972 c. 52 1523
period, the provisions of Part V of this Act relating to enforcement
SCH. 22
notices shall apply in relation thereto as if the works had been
carried out, or the use begun, as the case may be, at the end of
that period and without the grant of planning permission in that
behalf.

this Act to grant permission for the retention on land of buildings

visions of this paragraph shall apply in relation to those works or
that use as if those conditions had been imposed on the grant of
permission under a planning scheme or an interim development
order.

applying the preceding provisions of this paragraph, subject to such
adaptations and modifications as may be specified in the regula-
tions, to works on land carried out, or uses of land begun, at any
time before the appointed day, in accordance with permission granted

of that section to have been so served, shall be treated as carried
out or begun in accordance with permission granted subject to a
condition restricting the period for which the works or use might
be continued on the land.
77.- (1 ) Where permission for any development of land was
granted, at any time after 10th November 1943 and before the
appointed day, on an application in that behalf made under an interim
development order, then, if and so far as that development was not
carried out before the appointed day and the permission was in force
immediately before that day, planning permission shall be deemed
to have been granted in respect thereof subject to the like conditions
( if any) as were imposed by the permission under the interim
development order as it had effect immediately before the appointed
day:
Provided that this sub-paragraph shall not apply in relation to
any development for which permission was required before the
appointed day under the Restriction of Ribbon Development Act 1935 c. 47.

( 2 ) The provisions of section 42 of this Act shall apply in relation
to planning permission which is deemed to have been granted by
virtue of this paragraph as if it had been granted on an application
under Part III of this Act ; and, in relation to any order made under
that section for the revocation or modification of any such permission,
any reference in section 153( 3) of this Act to the grant of permission
shall be construed as a reference to the grant of the permission under
the interim development order .
(3) Where permission for any development of land was granted
as mentioned in sub -paragraph (1) of this paragraph, and permission
for that development was also granted under the Restriction of
Ribbon Development Act 1935 then, if the permission so granted
under the said Act of 1935 was granted subject to conditions, those
conditions shall be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as
conditions imposed by the permission granted under the interim
development order.
78.- ( 1 ) Where any works for the erection or alteration of a
building had been begun but not completed before the appointed
day , then if-
( a ) immediately before that day those works could have been

ance with permission granted by or under an interim
development order ; and
(b ) where any permission was required under the Restriction
of Ribbon Development Act 1935 for the carrying out of
those works, that permission was granted,
planning permission shall be deemed to have been granted in respect
of the completion of those works.
(2) The planning permission deemed to have been granted by
virtue of this paragraph shall be deemed to have been so granted
subject to any conditions applicable thereto under the scheme or
the permission granted by or under the interim development order,
as the case may be, and to any conditions imposed by the permission
( if any) granted under the Restriction of Ribbon Development Act
1935 and shall include permission to use the building, when erected
or altered
( a ) where the purpose for which it could be so used was pre-
scribed by or under the planning scheme, or by the
permission granted by or under the interim development
order, as the case may be, for that purpose ;
( b) in any other case, for the purpose for which the building,
or the building as altered, was designed.
( 3) In relation to any such works as are mentioned in sub-
paragraph ( 1) of this paragraph, being works in respect of which
permission was granted after 10th November 1943, on an application
in that behalf made under an interim development order, the pro-
visions of this paragraph shall have effect in substitution for the
provisions of paragraph 77 of this Schedule.
Town and Country Planning (Scotland ) Act 1972 c. 52 1525
79.- (1) Any reference in Part VII of this Act, or in Schedule 13
thereto, to a planning decision shall, where the context so admits,

tion of the lands affected or a description by reference of those lands

Act 1874.
2.- (1 ) Before making a general vesting declaration with respect
to any land which is subject to a compulsory purchase order, the
acquiring authority shall include in the notice of the making or
confirmation of the order which is required to be published or served
by paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to the Acquisition Act 1947 or any
other provision of the relevant enactments corresponding to that
paragraph, or in a notice given subsequently and before the service
of the notice to treat in respect of that land-
( a ) such a statement of the effect of paragraphs 1 to 8 of this
Schedule as may be prescribed; and
( b ) a notification to the effect that every person who, if a general
vesting declaration were made in respect of all the land
comprised in the order in respect of which notice to treat
has not been given, would be entitled to claim compensation

the authority making the declaration in the prescribed form
with respect to his name and address and the land in question .
( 2) The requirements of the relevant enactments with respect
to the publication and service of a notice of the making or confirmation
of a compulsory purchase order shall apply to a notice under this
paragraph given subsequently to the first-mentioned notice.
3. A general vesting declaration shall not be executed before the
end of the period of two months beginning with the date of the
first publication of the notice complying with paragraph 2(1 ) above,
or such longer period, if any, as may be specified in the notice:

SCH. 24
period of two months, or of the longer period so specified, as the
casemay be.
4. As soon as may be after executing a general vesting declaration,

declaration (other than land in which there subsists a short
tenancy or a long tenancy which is about to expire) ; and

date on which the declaration was made, a notice to treat had been
served on every person on whom, under section 17 of the Lands
Clauses Consolidation (Scotland ) Act 1845 (on the assumption that
they required to take the whole of the land specified in the declaration
and had knowledge of all the parties referred to in that section ) the
acquiring authority could have served such a notice, other than-
( a ) any person entitled to an interest in the land in respect of
which such a notice had actually been served before the end
of that period; and
( b ) any person entitled to a short tenancy or a long tenancy
which is about to expire.
7. At the end of the period specified in a general vesting
declaration, the land specified in the declaration, together with

have any power to expede a notarial instrument ( whether for
vesting land or any interest in land in themselves or for extinguish-
ing the whole or part of any feu-duty, ground annual or rent, or
other payment or incumbrance) had arisen in respect of all the
land and all interests therein, and the acquiring authority had duly
exercised that power accordingly at the end of that period.

any of the land in which the tenancy subsists a notice stating
that, at the end of such period as is specified in the notice
( not being less than fourteen days) from the date on which
the notice is served, they intend to enter upon and take
possession of such land as is specified in the notice, and
that period has expired; and
( b) the vesting of the land in the acquiring authority shall be
subject to the tenancy until that period expires, or the tenancy

( b ) that by reason of that incumbrance the compensation paid
exceeded the compensation to which the claimant was entitled
in respect of that interest,

to the compensation paid, or to so much of that compensation as,
on a proper apportionment thereof , is attributable to that part of

PART III
INTERPRETATION
38.- (1 ) In this Schedule " short tenancy " means a tenancy for
a year or from year to year or any lesser interest, and " long tenancy
which is about to expire ", in relation to a general vesting declaration,
means a tenancy granted for an interest greater than a short tenancy,
but having at the date of the declaration a period still to run which is
not more than the specified period ( that is to say, such period, longer
than one year, as may for the purposes of this paragraph be specified
in the declaration in relation to the land in which the tenancy subsists).
( 2 ) In determining for the purposes of this paragraph what period
a tenancy still has to run at the date of a general vesting declaration
it shall be assumed-
(a ) that the tenant will exercise any option to renew the tenancy,
and will not exercise any option to terminate the tenancy,
then or thereafter available to him, and
( b ) that the landlord will exercise any option to terminate the
tenancy then or thereafter available to him.
39. In this Schedule-
66 Acquisition Act 1947 " means the Acquisition of Land 1947 c. 42.
( Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 ;
" relevant enactments ", in relation to an acquiring authority,
means the enactments under which that authority may
acquire or be authorised to acquire land compulsorily and
which prescribe a procedure for effecting the compulsory
acquisition of land by them by means of a compulsory
purchase order;
" land ", in relation to compulsory acquisition by an acquir-
ing authority, has the same meaning as in the relevant
enactments.

paragraph, in those cases that fixed number of hours ( in this para-
graph referred to as " the number of hours without overtime ") shall
be the normal working hours.
( 2 ) If in such a case-
( a ) the contract of employment fixes the number, or the
minimum number, of hours of employment in the said
week or other period (whether or not it also provides for
the reduction of that number or minimum number of hours
in certain circumstances), and

shall be liable to pay the employee for the normal working hours
as much as the amount which would have been payable if the
employee had been employed throughout the part of the normal
working hours covered by paragraphs (a ), ( b) and (c ) of sub-para-
graph (1) of this paragraph.
( 3) If sub-paragraph (2) does not apply, the employer shall be

remuneration payable to him by the employer in respect of the
period of four weeks ending with the last complete week before the
notice was given.

only the hours when the employee was working, and only the
remuneration payable for, or apportionable to, those hours of work,
shall be brought in ; and if for any of the said four weeks no such
remuneration was payable by the employer to the employee, account
shall be taken of remuneration in earlier weeks so as to bring the
number of weeks of which account is taken up to four.
( 5) Where, in arriving at the said average hourly rate of remunera-
tion, account has to be taken of remuneration payable for, or
apportionable to, work done in hours other than normal working
hours, and the amount of that remuneration was greater than it

account shall be taken of that remuneration as if-
( a ) the work had been done in normal working hours, and
( b ) the amount of that remuneration had been reduced
accordingly.
( 6 ) For the purposes of the application of sub-paragraph ( 5) of
this paragraph to a case falling within paragraph 1(2) of this
Schedule, sub-paragraph ( 5 ) shall be construed as if , for the
words " had been done in normal working hours ", in each place
where those words occur, there were substituted the words " had
been done in normal working hours falling within the number of
hours without overtime (as defined by paragraph 1 of this
Schedule ) ".
( 7) Any payments made to the employee by his employer in
respect of the relevant part of the period of notice, whether by way
of sick pay, holiday pay or otherwise, shall go towards meeting the
employer's liability under this paragraph.

no account shall be taken of a week in which the employee worked
Contracts of Employment Act 1972 c. 53
1555
for the employer for less than twenty-one hours ; and where, as a
result, the period for which the average is to be taken would be less
than eight weeks, account shall be taken of remuneration in earlier
weeks so as to bring the number of weeks averaged up to eight.
( 4 ) Subject to the next following sub-paragraph, the employer's
obligation under this paragraph shall be conditional on the employee
being ready and willing to do work of a reasonable nature and amount
to earn remuneration at the rate mentioned in sub-paragraph (2).

absent from work in accordance with the terms of his
employment relating to holidays ,
and any payment made to an employee by his employer in respect
of such a period, whether by way of sick pay, holiday pay or other-
wise, shall be taken into account for the purposes of this paragraph
as if it were remuneration paid by the employer in respect of that
period .

liability under this paragraph shall not arise unless and until the
employee leaves the service of the employer in pursuance of the
notice.
Sickness or industrial injury benefit

effect where the arrangements in force relating to the employment
are such that-
(a ) payments by way of sick pay are made by the employer
to employees to whom the arrangements apply, in cases
where any such employees are incapable of work because
of sickness or injury, and
( b) in calculating any payment so made to any such employee
an amount representing, or treated as representing, sickness
benefit or industrial injury benefit is taken into account,
whether by way of deduction or by way of calculating the
payment as a supplement to that amount.
( 2) If during any part of the period of notice the employee is
incapable of work because of sickness or injury, and-
( a ) one or more payments, either by way of sick pay or as
amounts required to be paid by virtue of this Schedule, are
made to him by the employer in respect of that part of
the period of notice, and
( b ) in calculating any such payment such an amount as is
referred to in sub-paragraph ( 1)(b) of this paragraph is
taken into account as therein mentioned,
then for the purposes of this Schedule the amount so taken into
account shall be treated as having been paid by the employer to
the employee by way of sick pay in respect of that part of that period ,
and shall go towards meeting the liability of the employer under
paragraph 2 or paragraph 3 of this Schedule accordingly.

in section 50(1 ) of the National Insurance ( Industrial Injuries) 1965 c. 51 .
Act 1965, that the decision of a claim or question as there
mentioned is to be final shall not make any finding of fact or
other determination embodied in or necessary to a decision, or
on which it is based, conclusive for the purpose of any further
decision.
( 2) A decision (given under section 48( 2) of the National
Insurance (Industrial Injuries ) Act 1965 or otherwise) that an

in relation to the accident, and neither any such decision nor
the reference to a medical board or medical appeal tribunal
under section 37 of that Act of the disablement questions in
connection with any claim to or award of disablement benefit
is to be taken as importing a decision as to the origin of any
injury or disability suffered by the claimant, whether or not
there is an event identifiable as an accident apart from any
injury that may have been received ; but-
(a) a decision that on a particular occasion when there was
no such event a person had an industrial accident by
reason of an injury shall be treated as a decision that if
the injury was suffered by accident on that occasion,
the accident was an industrial accident ; and
( b) a decision that an accident was an industrial accident
may be given, and a declaration to that effect be made
and recorded in accordance with section 48, without
its having been found that personal injury resulted
from the accident (saving always the discretion under
section 48(3) to refuse to determine the question if it
is unlikely to be necessary for the purposes of a claim
for benefit) .
( 3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection ( 1) or ( 2) above
( but subject to the provisions of Part III of the National Insurance
(Industrial Injuries) Act 1965 as to appeal and review), where
for purposes of disablement benefit in respect of an accident
it has been found by a medical board or medical appeal tribunal,
on the determination or last determination of the disablement
questions , that an injury resulted in whole or in part from the
accident, then for purposes of death benefit in respect of that
accident (including benefit on a death occurring before the
passing of this Act) the finding shall be conclusive that the
injury did so result.

PART I
Calculation of rateable value of notional hereditament
1. The provisions of this Part of this Schedule shall
have effect for the purpose of calculating for any rate
period the rateable value of the hereditament which, by
virtue of section 33( 3) of this Act, the British Gas
Corporation ( hereafter referred to as " the Corporation ")
are to be treated as occupying in any rating area.
2.- (1) Subject to sub-paragraph ( 2 ) of this paragraph
and to paragraph 4( 3) of Schedule 5 to the Gas Act
1972, the Corporation shall be taken for the purposes
of this Part of this Schedule to have a basic total of
rateable values equal to £9,640,560.
( 2) If it appears to the Secretary of State that by
reason of any substantial change of circumstances it is
expedient so to do, he may, by order made after con-
sultation with the Corporation and with such associations
of local authorities as appear to him to be concerned, and
2 D4
c. 60
1782 Gas Act 1972
SCH. 5 with any local authority with whom consultation appears
to him to be desirable, vary the Corporation's basic total
of rateable values for the purposes of this Part of this
Schedule ; but an order under this sub-paragraph shall
not have effect until approved by a resolution of each
House of Parliament.
3. For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule, the
standard number of therms of the Corporation shall be 2,
154, 934, 611 .
4. For each year the Corporation shall-
( a ) estimate the number representing the total number
of therms which, in the penultimate year, they
supplied to consumers in England and Wales less
one- half the number of therms in any gas
which they purchased in that year in order to
supply consumers in England or Wales ; and
(b ) calculate and certify the amount by which that
estimated number exceeds or falls short of their
standard number of therms ;
and the Corporation's basic total of rateable values shall
be adjusted for that year by multiplying it by the fraction
of which the numerator is their standard number of
therms increased by one-fifth of the said excess or, as
the case may be, decreased by one-fifth of the said
deficiency, and the denominator is their standard number
oftherms.
5.(1) Subject to sub-paragraph ( 4 ) of this paragraph
and to section 33( 5) of this Act, the Corporation's basic
total of rateable values, as adjusted for any year under
paragraph 4 of this Schedule, shall be apportioned in
accordance with sub-paragraph ( 2) of this paragraph for
that year among all the rating areas in which, in the
penultimate year, the Corporation supplied any therms
to consumers, manufactured any therms, or produced
any therms by such an application of such a process as
is mentioned in section 33( 3)(c) of this Act.
( 2 ) The proportion of the Corporation's adjusted total
to be allocated under sub-paragraph (1) of this para-
graph to any one rating area shall be ascertained by
multiplying that adjusted total by the fraction of which
( a ) the numerator is the number of therms, as
estimated and certified by the Corporation,
which the Corporation supplied in the pen-
ultimate year to consumers in that area, plus
nine-tenths of the number of therms (if any), as
so estimated and certified, which in that year
the Corporation manufactured in that area or
produced in that area by such an application of
such a process as is mentioned in section 33(3)(c)
of this Act ; and
Gas Act 1972 1783
c .60
( b ) the denominator is the total number of therms, as so estimated and certified, which the Corporation
supplied in the penultimate year to consumers
in England and Wales, plus nine-tenths of the
total number of therms, as so estimated and
certified , which in that year the Corporation
manufactured in England or Wales or produced
in England or Wales by such an application of
such a process.
( 3 ) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) of this para-
graph, the number of therms produced by such an
application of such a process as aforesaid shall be taken
to be half the actual number thereof.
( 4 ) Subject to paragraph 13 of this Schedule, the
Secretary of State may by order provide that the
adjusted total aforesaid shall, instead of being appor-
tioned and allocated as provided by the foregoing pro-
visions of this paragraph, be apportioned and allocated
as provided by the order.
6. The amount which, in accordance with paragraph 5
of this Schedule, is allocated for any year to a rating
area shall be the rateable value of the hereditament
which, by virtue of section 33( 3) of this Act, the Corpora-
tion are to be treated as occupying in that area for any
rate period consisting of or forming part of that year.

THE INDEX TO
THE STATUTES IN FORCE
These two volumes (A-K, L-Z) index by subject-matter all the existing public general statute law under well-established headings linked by numerous cross-references. The index entries have against them references to the enactment or enactments which support the subject matter.
Since the references are to enactments (and not to pages of any book), the usefulness of the volumes is not limited to any particular set of statutes.
There is a chronological table showing the headings under which each Act or section is indexed in volumes, and a similar table for Church Assembly Measures.
The INDEX provides a service which is of the utmost value and which for its adaptability is unique.

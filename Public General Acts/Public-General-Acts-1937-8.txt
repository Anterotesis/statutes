the provisions of the next succeeding subsection shall have effect.

(2) Where the facts mentioned in paragraph (a) or (6) of the proviso to the foregoing subsection are proved with respect to any word or words, then—

(a) if the trade mark consists solely of that word or

those words, the registration of the trade mark, so far as regards registration in respect of the article or substance in question or of any goods of the same description, shall be deemed for the purposes of section thirty-two of this Act to be an entry wrongly remaining on the register;

(b) if the trade mark contains that word or those

words and other matter, the Court or the Registrar, in deciding whether the trade mark shall remain on the register, so far as regards registration in respect of the article or substance in question and of any goods of the same description, may in case of a decision in favour of its remaining on the register require as a condition thereof that the proprietor shall disclaim any right to the exclusive use in relation to that article or substance and any goods of the same description of that word or those words, so, however, that no disclaimer on the register shall affect any rights of the proprietor of a trade mark except such as arise out of the registration of the trade mark in respect of which the disclaimer is made; and

shall be deemed to have ceased on the date at which the use mentioned in paragraph (a) of the proviso to the foregoing subsection first became well known and established, or at the expiration of the period of two years mentioned in paragraph (6) of that proviso.

(3) No word which is the commonly used and accepted name of any single chemical element or single chemical compound, as distinguished from a mixture, shall be registered as a trade mark in respect of a chemical substance or preparation, and any such registration in force at the commencement of this Act or thereafter shall, notwithstanding anything in section thirteen of this Act, be deemed for the purposes of section thirty-two of this Act to be an entry made in the register without sufficient cause, or an entry wrongly remaining on the register, as the circumstances may require :

Provided that the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not have effect in relation to a word which is used to denote only a brand or make of the element or compound as made by the proprietor or a registered user of the trade mark, as distinguished from the element or compound as made by others, and in association with a suitable name or description open to the public use.

16, A trade mark may be limited in whole or in part to one or more specified colours, and in any such case the fact that it is so limited shall be taken into consideration by any tribunal having to decide on the distinctive character of the trade mark.

Provided that a mark shall not be so registrable in the name of a person who carries on a trade in goods of the kind certified.

(2) In determining whether a mark is adapted to distinguish as aforesaid, the tribunal may have regard to the extent to which—

(b) by reason of the use of the mark or of any other

circumstances, the mark is in fact adapted to distinguish as aforesaid in relation to the goods in question.

(3) Subject to the provisions of subsections (4) to (6) of this section, and of sections seven and eight of thus Act, the registration of a person as proprietor of a certification trade mark in respect of any goods shall, if valid, give to that person the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods, and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing words, that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, not being the proprietor of the trade mark or a person authorised by him under the regulations in that behalf using it in accordance therewith, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion, in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered, and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken either—

(a) as being use as a trade mark; or

(b) in a case in which the use is use upon the goods

or in physical relation thereto or in an advertising circular or other advertisement issued to the public, as importing a reference to some person having the right either as proprietor or by his authorisation under the relevant regulations to use the trade mark or to goods certified by the proprietor.

1 & 2 Geo. 6.

such mark as aforesaid in any mode, in relation to goods to be sold or otherwise traded in in any place, in relation to goods to be exported to any market, or in any other circumstances, to which, having regard to any such limitations, the registration does not extend.

(5) The right to the use of a certification trade mark given by registration as aforesaid shall not be deemed to be infringed by the use of any such mark as aforesaid by any person—

(a) in relation to goods certified by the proprietor

of the trade mark if, as to those goods or a bulk of which they form part, the proprietor or another in accordance with his authorisation under the relevant regulations has applied the trade mark and has not subsequently removed or obliterated it, or the proprietor has at any time expressly or impliedly consented to the use of the trade mark; or

(b) in relation to goods adapted to form part of,

or to be accessory to, other goods in relation to which the trade mark has been used without infringement of the right given as aforesaid or might for the time being be so used, if the use of the mark is reasonably necessary in order to indicate that the goods are so adapted and neither the purpose nor the effect of the use of the mark is to indicate otherwise than in accordance with the fact that the goods are certified by the proprietor :

Provided that paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not have effect in the case of use consisting of the application of any such mark as aforesaid to any goods, notwithstanding that they are such goods as are mentioned in that paragraph, if such application is contrary to the relevant regulations.

(6) Where a certification trade mark is one of two or more registered trade marks that are identical or nearly resemble each other, the use of any of those trade marks in exercise of the right to the use of that trade mark given by registration shall not be deemed to be an infringement of the right so given to the use of any other of those trade marks.

(7) There shall be deposited at the Patent Office in respect of every trade mark registered under this

(2) If the imports into Eire of any class or kind of goods enumerated in Parts I and II of Schedule V should increase to such an extent as to endanger the prospects of success of the producers or manufacturers of such goods in Eire, and if it should appear that such increase in imports is due to the reduction of customs duties in pursuance of this Article, then the Government of Eire shall be entitled to apply quantitative regulation to imports of such goods.

CHAPTER 26.

An Act to amend and continue the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts, 1920 to 1935.

[26th May 1938.]

BE it enacted by the Kang’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1. The principal Acts shall continue in force until the twenty-fourth day of June nineteen hundred and forty-two.

2.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act relating to registration, the principal Acts, as from the twenty-ninth day of September nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, shall not apply to any dwelling-house unless it is a dwelling-house to which they applied immediately before the passing of this Act or then formed part of such a dwelling-house, and it is also a dwelling-house of which the rateable value on the appointed day did not exceed—

(a) in the metropolitan police district or the city of London, thirty-five pounds;

(6) in Scotland, thirty-five pounds;

(c) elsewhere, twenty pounds.

(2) Where part of a dwelling-house to which the principal Acts applied immediately before the commencement of this Act was on the sixth day of December nineteen hundred and thirty-seven lawfully sublet and occupied as, or vacant and to let as, a separate dwelling, the rateable value of the whole dwelling-house on the

(6) For the purposes of the proviso to subsection (2) of this section and of the proviso to subsection (2) of section two of the Act of 1933, a person shall not be deemed to have had reasonable excuse for failing to make application for the registration of a dwelling-house unless he was prevented from making the application by illness, absence from the United Kingdom or some other similar cause or the failure to make the application was otherwise attributable to some cause beyond his control.

(ii) if the maker of the statement is called as a witness in the proceedings:

Provided that the condition that the maker of the statement shall be called as a witness need not be satisfied if he is dead, or unfit by reason of his bodily or mental condition to attend as a witness, or if he is beyond the seas and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance, or if all reasonable efforts to find him have been made without success. 2 (б)

(2) In any civil proceedings, the court may at any stage of the proceedings, if having regard to all die circumstances of the case it is satisfied that undue

(b) it is in accordance with any agreement in force made between the employer or any organisation of employers of which he is a member and any trade union, being an agreement regulating the remuneration in respect of that work of workers employed in the same trade or industry as the worker; or

Provided that, if in the trade or industry in which the employer is engaged or any branch thereof, arrangements exist for the settlement of disputes by conciliation or arbitration, made in pursuance of an agreement to which the parties are organisations of employers and trade unions which, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative respectively of substantial proportions of the employers and workers engaged or employed in that trade or industry, then, unless the employer is not a member of any of those organisations, the Minister shall refer the matter for settlement in accordance with the arrangements and shall not refer it for settlement by the Industrial Court, except in the event of his being requested so to do by both parties to the agreement after there has been a failure to obtain a settlement by means of the arrangements made in pursuance of the agreement.

effect of decisions of the Court made upon such a reference, shall apply only where the reference by the Minister is expressed to be a reference under this Part of this Act.

5.—(1) If in any proceedings upon a reference to the Industrial Court under this Part of this Act the Court finds that the remuneration paid to the worker in respect of the road haulage work on which he was employed was unfair, it shall be the- duty of the Court to fix the remuneration to be paid in respect of that work, and in the provisions of this Act hereinafter contained references to “ statutory remuneration ” shall be construed as including references to remuneration so fixed.

(2) The power of the Industrial Court under this Part of this Act to fix statutory remuneration to be paid to any workers shall include power to fix holiday remuneration and to require such remuneration to be paid to them in addition to remuneration payable for the road haulage work actually done by them.

(3) In determining whether the remuneration paid to a worker in respect of the work on which he was employed was unfair, and in fixing any statutory remuneration, the Industrial Court shall have regard not only to the provisions of subsection (3) of the last foregoing section but also to any agreements brought to its notice which are in force between organisations of employers and trade unions and regulate the remuneration of workers engaged on work similar to that of the worker in trades or industries which in the opinion of the Court are comparable to the trade or industry in which the worker is employed, to the general level of remuneration paid to workers in that trade or industry other than road haulage workers, and to such further circumstances as the Court considers relevant.

(4) In fixing any statutory remuneration, the Industrial Court shall specify the nature of the work in respect of which the remuneration is to be payable, and if a daily or weekly rate is fixed, the time for which the worker must be employed on road haulage work in any day or in any week respectively in order to render the daily or the weekly rate payable, and if any overtime payment is fixed, the number of hours of employment by his employer after which the overtime payment is to be payable to the worker, and the order shall contain such further provisions as may be necessary for defining the

employment in respect of which the statutory remuneration is to be payable and for enabling the remuneration payable to the worker to be ascertained.

(5) The Minister may make regulations as to the publication of decisions of the Industrial Court upon references under this Part of this Act.

(6) The statutory remuneration fixed by the Industrial Court in respect of any work upon a reference to the Court under this Part of this Act shall, as between the employer of the worker by whom or on whose behalf application for the reference was made and all workers employed by that employer on that work, be in force for a period of three years from the beginning of the week next after the date on which the statutory remuneration was so fixed, and as between that employer and the worker by whom or on whose behalf application for the reference was made the statutory remuneration shall also be deemed to have been in force for such earlier period not exceeding six months as the Court may direct:

Provided that, while statutory remuneration is in force under this section as between an employer and any worker, the employer or an organisation of employers of which he is a member or any such worker or a trade union of which such a worker is a member may, in the prescribed manner, make an application to the Minister for a review of the remuneration and thereupon the Minister shall refer the matter to the Industrial Court, and that Court may proceed thereon in like manner in all respects as in the case of an original reference, so, however, that no application for a review of any statutory remuneration fixed by the Court shall be made within three months after the remuneration has been so fixed or has last been reviewed by that Court.

worker, the employer shall in respect of that work during that period pay remuneration to the worker not less than the statutory remuneration clear of all deductions, and if the contract between the employer and the worker provides for the payment of less remuneration in respect of that work, it shall have effect as respects the said period as if for that less remuneration there were substituted the statutory remuneration clear of all deductions.

(2) For the purposes of the last foregoing subsection, the net remuneration obtainable by a worker in respect of any work after allowing for his necessary expenditure, if any, in connection with the work shall be deemed to be the remuneration paid to him and the expression “ deductions ” includes deductions in respect of any matter whatsoever except deductions under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, the National Health Insurance Act, 1936, or any enactment authorising deductions to be made from the remuneration of a worker in respect of contributions to any superannuation or other provident fund, and except any deduction or payment authorised to be made under section one, section two or section three of the Truck Act, 1896.

(3) Where the remuneration paid by an employer to a worker includes remuneration in respect of other work as well as in respect of road haulage work, the amount of the remuneration which is attributable to road haulage work shall, if not apparent from the terms of the contract between the employer and the worker, be deemed to be an amount bearing the same proportion to the total remuneration as the time spent on road haulage work during the period in respect of which the total remuneration is payable bears to the whole of the time in respect of which that remuneration is payable.

7.—(1) Any person who, in contravention of the provisions of this Act, fails to pay remuneration not less than the statutory remuneration, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds for each offence, and, if notice of intention so to do has been served with the summons, warrant or complaint, evidence may be given of any like contravention on the part of the employer in respect of any period during the two years immediately preceding the date of the offence, and on proof of the failure the court may order the

employer to pay such sum as is found by the court to represent the difference between the amount which ought to have been paid during that period to the worker by way of remuneration, if the provisions of this Act had been complied with, and the amount actually so paid.

(2) Where an offence for which an employer is under this section liable to a fine has in fact been committed by some agent of the employer or other person, that agent or other person shall be liable to be prosecuted for the offence in the same manner as if he were the employer, and either together with, or before or after the conviction of, the employer, and shall be liable on conviction to the same punishment as that to which the employer is liable.

(3) Where an employer who is charged with an offence under this section proves to the satisfaction of the court that he has used due diligence to secure compliance with the provisions of this Act, and that the offence was in fact committed by his agent or some other person without his consent, or connivance, he shall, in the event of the conviction of that agent or other person for the offence, be exempt from conviction for the offence.

(4) Where the holder of a licence granted under Part I of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, is convicted of an offence under this section, the licensing authority by whom the licence was granted may exercise the like powers under section thirteen of the said Act (which relates to the revocation and suspension of licences) as would be exercisable by that authority if a condition of the licence had not been complied with.

(5) Any officer appointed by the Minister and any officer of any government department assisting in carrying this Act into effect may institute proceedings for an offence under this section and may, although not of counsel or a solicitor, conduct any such proceedings.

(6) Any officer authorised in that behalf by special or general directions of the Minister may, if it appears to him that a sum is due from an employer to a worker on account of the payment of remuneration to him less than the statutory remuneration in force in respect of the work, institute on behalf of or in the name of the worker civil proceedings for the recovery of that sum, and in any such proceedings the court may make an order

for the payment of costs by the officer as if he were a party to the proceedings.

(7) The powers given by this section for the recovery of sums due from an employer to a worker shall not be in derogation of any right of the worker to recover such sums by civil proceedings.

(8) If any person is convicted under Part I of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, of using a goods vehicle for a purpose for which an A licence, a B licence or a C licence is required, otherwise than under such a licence, any road haulage work performed by a road haulage worker in connection with the vehicle while it was being so used shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have been road haulage work in connection with a goods vehicle specified in an A licence, a B licence or a C licence granted under that Act as the case may be, and the provisions of this and of the last foregoing section shall apply accordingly.

8. —(1) In any legal proceedings a certificate signed by the secretary of the Industrial Court or other officer having the custody of the records of that Court certifying that the Court has fixed statutory remuneration and setting out the effect, extent and duration of the statutory remuneration so fixed shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein.

(2) A certificate purporting to be signed by the secretary of the Industrial Court or such other officer as aforesaid shall be received in evidence and be deemed to be so signed without further proof unless the contrary is shown.

9. —(1) Where any person who is the holder of a licence granted under Part I of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, or who carries on the business of a goods transport clearing house makes by way of trade an arrangement expressed or implied with any worker in pursuance of which the worker performs any work with respect to which statutory remuneration would, if the worker were employed by that person, be in force under this Act, the worker shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be employed by that person and references in this Act to an employer shall be construed accordingly:

Ch. 44.

391

Provided that, where the only work performed by the worker in pursuance of the arrangement is work in connection with a goods vehicle specified in a licence of which the worker is the holder, being an A licence other than a licence granted under subsection (1) of section seven of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, or a B licence, then—

(a) in a case where the arrangement was made by way of sub-contract with the worker for the purpose of enabling the employer to execute a contract for the transport of goods entered into by him, the employer shall be deemed not to have contravened the provisions of section six of this Act if he proves that the sum paid to the worker in respect of the work performed by him was not more than ten per cent, less than the amount payable to the employer under his contract in respect of that work;

(b) in a case where the person by whom the arrangement with the worker was made is neither the holder of an A licence or a B licence nor a person who carries on the business of a goods transport clearing house, and the arrangement was made by him only for the carriage of goods for or in connection with any trade or business carried on by him, the foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply.

(2) In this section the expression “ business of a goods transport clearing house” means the business of arranging for the mechanical transport of goods by road.

10.—(1) When statutory remuneration is in force under this Act as between an employer and any workers employed by him, it shall be the duty of the employer to keep such records as are necessary to show that the provisions of this Act are being complied with as respects those workers.

(2) The Minister may make regulations prescribing the form in which such records as aforesaid are to be kept by an employer, and the period for which any such records are to be retained by him, and requiring employers to post in the prescribed manner such notices as may be prescribed for the purpose of informing persons employed by them of proposals to fix remuneration under this Act and of any remuneration so fixed.

Provided that no application shall be made to the court by or on behalf of any person in any case where the testator has bequeathed not less than two-thirds of the income of the net estate to a surviving spouse and the only other dependant or dependants, if any, is or are a child or children of the surviving spouse.

(2) The proviso to subsection (1) shall cease to have effect and the following two subsections shall be inserted immediately after the said subsection (1):—

“ (1A) Where, whether before or after any such transfer, such an individual receives or is entitled to receive any capital sum the payment whereof is in any way connected with the transfer or any associated operation, any income which, by virtue or in consequence of the transfer, either alone or in conjunction with associated operations, has become the income of a person resident or domiciled out of the United Kingdom shall, whether it would or would not have been chargeable to income tax apart from the provisions of this section, be deemed to be the income of that individual for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts.

In this subsection the expression ‘ capital sum ’ means—

taxation was not the purpose or one of the purposes for which the transfer or associated operations or any of them were effected; or

(b) that the transfer and any associated opera-

tions were bona fide commercial transactions and were not designed for the purpose of avoiding liability to taxation.”

(3) In paragraph (d) of subsection (3) of the said section, the following words shall be inserted after the word “income ” :—

(2) When any sum has been paid during the administration period in respect of that limited interest the amount thereof shall, subject to the provisions of the next following subsection, be deemed for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts to have been paid to that person as income for the year of assessment in which that sum was paid, or, in the case of a sum paid in respect of an interest that has ceased, for the last year of assessment in which it was subsisting.

Provided that, where relief has been so given, such part of the amount in respect of which he has been charged to standard tax as corresponds to the said proportion shall, for the purposes of surtax, be deemed to represent income of such an amount as would after deduction of standard tax be equal to that part of the amount charged.

31.—(1) The following provisions of this section shall have effect in relation to a person who, during the administration period or during a port of that period, has an absolute interest in the residue of the estate of a deceased person or in a part thereof.

(a) the administration period was current; and

(b) that person had that interest;

and the amount so ascertained in respect of any year or part of a year, or, in the case of a person having an absolute interest in a part of a residue, a proportionate part of that amount, is in this Part of this Act referred to as the “ residuary income ” of that person for that year of assessment:

Provided that, when the legacy duty charged on the residue, or on the part thereof in which that person has an absolute interest, as the case may be, has been paid in respect of income for any such year or part of a year as aforesaid, his residuary income for that year shall thereafter be treated for the purposes of surtax as reduced by the amount of that duty so far as paid in respect of such income.

(3) When any sum or sums has or have been paid during the administration period in respect of that absolute interest, the amount of that sum or the aggregate amount of those sums shall, subject to the provisions of the next following subsection, be deemed for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts to have been paid to that person as income to the extent to which, and for the year or years of assessment for which, he would have been

(a) in the case of a United Kingdom estate, his

residuary income for that year less standard tax for that year, or

(b) in the case of a foreign estate, his residuary

income for that year,

and that sum or the aggregate of those sums had been available for application primarily in or towards satisfaction of those rights as they accrued and had been so applied.

In the case of a United Kingdom estate, any amount which is deemed to have been paid to that person as income for any year by virtue of this subsection shall be deemed to be income of such an amount as would after deduction of standard tax for that year be equal to the amount deemed to have been so paid, and to be income that has borne standard tax.

(4) On the completion of the administration of the estate—

an amount deemed to have been paid to him as income in respect of an interest in a foreign estate and any part of the aggregate income of that estate for that year has borne United Kingdom income tax by deduction or otherwise, the tax so charged on him shall, on proof of the facts to the satisfaction of the General or Special Commissioners, be reduced by an amount bearing the same proportion thereto as the amount of the said income which has borne United Kingdom income tax bears to the amount of the said aggregate income.

32.—(1) The amount of the residuary income of an estate for any year of assessment shall be ascertained by deducting from the aggregate income of the estate for that year—

(a) the amount of any annual interest, annuity, or

other annual payment for that year which is a charge on residue and the amount of any payment made in that year in respect of any such expenses incurred by the personal representatives as such in the management of the assets of the estate as, in the absence of any express provision in a will, would be properly chargeable to income, but excluding any such interest, annuity or payment allowed or allowable in computing the aggregate income of the estate; and

(b) the amount of any of the aggregate income of the

estate for that year to which a person has on or after assent become entitled by virtue of a specific disposition either for a vested interest during the administration period or for a vested or contingent interest on the completion of the administration.

(2) In the event of its appearing, on the completion of the administration of an estate in the residue of which, or in a part of the residue of which, a person had an absolute interest at the completion of the administration, that the aggregate of the benefits received in respect of that interest does not amount to as much as the aggregate for all years of the residuary income of the person having that interest, his residuary income for each year shall be reduced for the purpose of the last foregoing section by an amount bearing the same proportion

(a) as regards a sum paid before the completion of

the administration, in the case of a United Kingdom estate such an amount as would, after deduction of standard tax for the year of assessment in which that sum was paid, be equal to that sum, or in the case of a foreign estate the amount of that sum; and

(b) as regards a sum payable on the completion

of the administration, in the case of a United Kingdom estate such an amount as would, after deduction of standard tax for the year of assessment in which the administration is completed, be equal to that sum, or in the case of a foreign estate the amount of that sum.

(3) In the application of the last foregoing subsection to a residue or a part of a residue in which a person other than the person having an absolute interest at the completion of the administration had an absolute interest at any time during the administration period, the aggregates therein mentioned shall be computed in relation to those interests taken together, and the residuary income of that other person also shall be subject to reduction thereunder.

33.—(1) Where the personal representatives of a deceased person have as such a right in relation to the estate of another deceased person such that, if that right were vested in them for their own benefit, they would have an absolute or limited interest in the residue of that estate or in a part thereof, they shall be deemed to have that interest notwithstanding that that right is not vested in them for their own benefit, and any amount deemed to be paid to them as income by virtue of this Part of this Act shall be treated as part of the aggregate income of the estate of the person whose personal representatives they are.

(a) if an assessment has already been made upon him for that year, such adjustments shall be made in that assessment as may be necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Part of this Act which take effect on the completion of the administration, and any tax overpaid shall be repaid;

(b) if-

(i) any relief has been allowed to him by reference to the amount which has been previously deemed as aforesaid to have been paid to him as income for that year; and

The abstract of schedules and schedules annexed hereto, with the notes (if any) to such schedules, shall be deemed to be part of this Act in the same manner as if they had been contained in the body thereof.

In addition to the sums hereby granted out of the Consolidated Fund, there may be applied out of any money directed under section two of the Public Accounts 54 & 55 Vict, and Charges Act, 1891, to be applied as appropriations in c- 24-aid of the grants for the services and purposes specified in Schedule (B) annexed hereto the sums respectively set forth in the last column of the said schedule.

satisfies the court that he is authorised by the accused, appears on behalf of the accused and tenders a plea of not guilty,

the provisions of the Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland) Act, 1908 (except paragraph (1) of section thirty-two), shall apply in like manner as if the accused had appeared and tendered such plea.

(3) In the foregoing provisions of this section any reference to a plea of not guilty shall include a reference to a plea of guilty to part only of the charge which is not accepted by the prosecutor.

5* Paragraph (2) of section thirty-three of the Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland) Act, 1908 (which empowers a court in certain circumstances to hear and dispose of a case in the absence of the accused), shall have effect as if for the words “involving the imposition of a pecuniary penalty only ” there were substituted the words “for which a sentence of imprisonment cannot be imposed.”

6. The power conferred on a court of summary jurisdiction by section fifty-four of the Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland) Act, 1908, to alter or modify a sentence shall be exercisable without requiring the attendance of the accused, and, without prejudice to the generality of the said power, shall include power in the ease where payment of a fine by instalments has been ordered, to reduce the amount, or allow further time for the payment,

(b) full regard shall be had to the nature of the

said premises in all respects and, in particular, in determining whether any act or omission involves a breach of the obligation imposed on a vendor by the said rules to take due care of land that is the subject of a contract for sale, no person shall be treated as under obligation to exercise any greater measure of care in relation to any of the said premises than is exercised under the ordinary practice of the management of mineral estates by prudent owners in relation to property that is to continue in their ownership; and

(c) the contract for sale to be assumed for the purposes of the said rules shall be a contract providing expressly that the vendor should be entitled to the possession and enjoyment of the property until the date fixed for completion and to the benefit of the rents and profits thereof accruing up to that date, and that rents and profits accruing, or coal worked, before that date from a mine of coal that is opened after the date of the contract should be treated in like manner as if the mine had been open at the date thereof.

9.—(1) Where it is proposed to grant during the interim period (otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of section twelve of this Act) a coal-mining lease of or comprising any premises that are to vest in the Commission by virtue of this Part of this Act, or to vary or renew such a lease, a draft of the proposed lease or other instrument must be delivered to the Commission at least two months before the date on which it is to be executed.

(4) If—

(a) any such lease, variation or renewal as is

mentioned in subsection (1) of this section is granted or effected during the interim period otherwise than pursuant to a proposal notified to the Commission as required by that subsection; or

(b) any such lease, variation or renewal as afore-

said, or any other disposition of or affecting any premises that are to vest in the Commission by virtue of this Part of this Act, is granted or effected during the interim period in such manner as to contravene any of the said rules;

then, unless it is so granted or effected with the consent of the Commission or is saved by the provisions of the last preceding subsection, it shall, so far as regards the title for which the premises in question vest in the Commission, be void, and any right accruing to the Commission to sue for damages in respect of any act or omission that contravenes any of the said rules may be enforced as well after as before the vesting date, notwithstanding that the Commission became aware thereof before that date.

10. It shall be within the competence of the Commission to take from the person entitled thereto an assignment of any debt due from a lessee in respect of rent payable before the vesting date for premises that are to vest or have vested in the Commission, and, in the case of such rent becoming payable at any time within the twelve months next before the vesting date, the Commission shall, on being required so to do by notice in writing served on them by the person entitled

11#—(1) In the case of every coal-mining lease subsisting on the vesting date in the case of which either—

(a) a severance of the reversion immediately expec-

tant on the lease is effected, by the vesting in the Commission by virtue of this Part of this Act of that reversion as regards a part only of the premises which are comprised in the lease; or

(b) a severance of the interests arising under the lease is effected, by the vesting in the Commission by virtue of this Part of this Act of those interests as regards a part only of the premises which are comprised in the lease and the immediate reversion in which is vested in the Commission;

and the lease does not reserve separate rents for the several parts of the premises, the rent reserved by the lease shall be apportioned, and the parts of that rent to be apportioned to the several parts of the premises shall, in default of agreement between the Commission and any other person entitled in reversion immediately expectant on the lease and the lessee, be determined by an arbitrator selected by agreement between the parties or, in default of agreement, by the Lord Chancellor in the case of England or the Lord President of the Court of Session in the case of Scotland.

(2) Where an apportionment of the rent reserved by a lease has been made for the purposes of a valuation of a part of the premises under the Third Schedule to this Act, an arbitrator shall have regard to that apportionment for the purposes of a determination under the preceding subsection.

(3) In the case of every coal-mining lease subsisting on the vesting date in the case of which such a severance as aforesaid is effected as aforesaid, the Commission shall pay the costs reasonably incurred by any person in connection with a reference to arbitration under subsection (1)

of this section, or with any application to the Court that may be requisite for the purpose of determining any question as to the rights or liabilities of any person under the lease that arises in consequence of the severance :

Provided that the arbitrator or the Court, as the case may be, may direct that the Commission shall not be liable to pay any such costs as aforesaid incurred by a person who appears to the Court to have made a reference or application or prosecuted proceedings thereon unreasonably, or to have been guilty of any such unreasonable failure to agree with the Commission or with any other party, or of any such negligence or default, as to disentitle him to payment of those costs; and, if it appears to the Court that the necessity for the determination of the question raised on an application arose in part only in consequence of such a severance as aforesaid, the Court may direct that the Commission shall be liable to pay a proportionate part only of such costs as aforesaid.

(4) A Regional Valuation Board shall cause proper records to be kept of apportionments of rent made by them for the purposes of valuations made by them and of any alteration of any such apportionment made by a referee on a review of a valuation made by them, and any entry in any book or other document kept for the purposes of this subsection, or a copy thereof upon which is endorsed a certificate purporting to be signed by a person authorised in that behalf by the Board stating that the copy is a true copy, shall in all legal proceedings be evidence of the entry and of the apportionment referred to.

12.—(1) Where rights to work a number of parcels of coal are subsisting under a number of coal-mining leases in the same working lessee and it appears to the Commission that it is expedient that arrangements should be made during the interim period for the working of that coal as a whole under a single lease, the Commission may make, in agreement with the working lessee, a scheme for the purposes of this section (in this section and in the Fourth Schedule to this Act referred to as a “ lease consolidation scheme ”).

(2) A single lease to be granted pursuant to a lease consolidation scheme that relates to any colliery area must comprise all the coal and mines of coal in that colliery area.

(4) In connection with each lease consolidation scheme, provision shall be made in the manner specified in the Fourth Schedule to this Act for ascertaining an amount (in this section and in that Schedule referred to as the “ standard amount of rent ”) representing the amount of rent which, after deduction of income tax, mineral rights duty and royalties welfare levy, might reasonably have been expected to become receivable, if the scheme had not been made, in right of each reversion (whether immediate or superior) on a subsisting working lease in premises that are to be comprised in the single lease, for each half year (or other period in respect of which rent is to be receivable under the single lease) between the coming into operation of the scheme and the vesting date.

(5) If the amount of the rent receivable, after such deduction as aforesaid, under the single lease, in respect of the premises comprised therein, being premises that were comprised in any of the subsisting working leases, for any period for which standard amounts of rent are fixed in connection with the scheme, is less than the aggregate of those standard amounts, the Commission shall pay to the person entitled to recover that rent such a sum as after deduction of income tax will yield an amount equal to the deficiency, and any sum so paid for any period shall be deemed to be income for that period of the respective persons entitled beneficially to that rent.

(6) If the amount of the rent receivable as aforesaid is greater than the aggregate aforesaid, the person entitled to recover that rent shall pay to the Commission an amount equal to the excess.

(7) In this section and in the Fourth Schedule to this Act—

(c) the expression “ subsisting working lease” means a coal-mining lease which comprises any coal in a colliery area to which a lease consolidation scheme relates and which is held as aforesaid by or for the benefit of the working lessee.

13.—(1) A person carrying on the business of coalmining immediately before the vesting date, who is then beneficially entitled (whether or not subject to a mortgage) to the entire fee simple in coal or a mine of coal that is not subject at that date to any coal-mining lease, shall have the right, if he has made an application in writing in that behalf to the Commission before the vesting date, to a grant from the Commission of a coalmining lease comprising any coal or mine of coal specified in his application to which he is so entitled and any property and rights that vest in the Commission therewith :

Provided that—

(a) the right under this section to a grant of a

lease of any coal or mine shall be conditional upon the applicant’s satisfying the requirements of the Third Schedule to this Act as to the registration of particulars thereof under the Registration Act and the making of a claim for compensation for the fee simple therein, and to his complying with the provisions of that Schedule that impose upon him any duty in connection with the valuation of the fee simple therein; and

(b) a person shall not be entitled under this

section to a lease the grant of which would interfere with the exercise of a right granted by a working facilities order, or with the use or exercise under a coal-mining lease of any property or right comprised therein.

(3) The provisions of the Fifth Schedule to this Act shall have effect with respect to the granting of leases under this section, and the substitution or variation of securities in the case of premises that were subject to a mortgage.

A person required by this subsection to deliver a copy of a lease or a statement shall be entitled to be paid by the Commission all costs reasonably incurred by him in the preparation and delivery thereof.

(2) On the vesting date the property in, and the right to possession of, the following documents relating solely to the management of coal or a mine of coal shall vest in the Commission, that is to say, all plans, sections, records of survey and other similar documents, that belonged immediately before the vesting date to a person interested in coal or a mine of coal, other than—

(a) documents that belonged to a person having a

retained interest and that relate to the premises in which that interest subsists;

(b) documents that belonged to a person who has duly

made application under section thirteen of this Act for a grant from the Commission of a lease of any premises and that relate to those premises; and

(c) documents which, whilst relating solely to the

management of coal or a mine of coal, relate to matters of management that touch or concern other land in which the person to whom the documents belonged is interested at the vesting date.

(3) Where after the vesting date a person retains possession of any document relating to the title to, or to the management of, coal or a mine of coal, he shall be deemed to have given to the Commission an acknowledgment in writing of the right of the Commission to production of that document and to delivery of copies thereof, and section sixty-four of the Law of Property Act, 1925, shall have effect accordingly, and on the basis that the acknowledgment did not contain any such expression of contrary intention as is mentioned in that section.

of a right required by reason of the subsistence of a retained copyhold interest; and

meaning of this Part of this Act may be properly and conveniently worked, that is to say—

“ (/) In a case in which the surface has been used for the erection of any works for a coalmining purpose within the meaning of Part I of the Coal Act, 1938, or of dwellings for persons employed in connection with the working of coal within the meaning of that Part of that Act, or with any such works as aforesaid or as are mentioned in paragraph (c) of this subsection, a right to use and occupy the works or dwellings for the purposes for which they were erected.”

(4) Where such a right as is specified in the last preceding subsection is to be granted on the termination of a lease, and a right to erect or use the works or dwellings was comprised in that lease, the Railway and Canal Commission, in determining whether any compensation or consideration is to be paid or given in respect of the right to be granted by them and the amount thereof, if any, shall have regard to the fact that the right comprised in the lease was therein comprised and to the amount of any rent reserved by the lease in respect thereof.

immediately after their accounts for each financial year have been made up, an amount equal to any excess of their revenues for that year over their liabilities for that year properly chargeable to revenue account, whether in respect of salaries, allowances, remuneration, pensions, gratuities or expenses payable under the First or Third Schedule to this Act or of other administrative expenses, of interest on any loan raised or stock issued by them, of any sums which by the terms of the raising or issue of any such loan or stock they are bound to set aside towards the repayment of the principal thereof, or of any other matter involving a liability properly so chargeable (which excess is in this and the next succeeding section referred to as the Commission’s “ annual surplus ”).

(2) The reserve fund shall be applicable primarily for the purposes of meeting any deficiency at any time arising on the revenue account of the Commission and of meeting any extraordinary claim or demand at any time arising against the Commission, and the Board of Trade shall from time to time, with the approval of the Treasury, by regulation prescribe—

(a) an amount, in this and the next succeeding section referred to as “ the prescribed minimum reserve ”, being such an amount as may be required by the Board with the approval of the Treasury to be held for the time being to the credit of the reserve fund for answering those purposes; and

(b) an amount, in this and the next succeeding section referred to as “the prescribed appropriation to reserve ”, being such an amount as may be required by the Board with the approval of the Treasury to be made available for carrying to the credit of the reserve fund at the end of each financial year of the Commission whilst the regulation remains in force.

(3) At any time at which the value of the reserve fund is greater than the prescribed minimum reserve, the Commission may apply a part thereof, not exceeding in value the amount of the excess, in purchasing for cancellation stock issued by them under this Part of this Act or otherwise for the redemption of debt.

(4) Sums credited to the reserve fund shall be invested from time to time in such securities of the Government of

1938. Coed Act,1938. Ch. 52.

the United Kingdom as the Commission may, with the approval of the Board of Trade, think fit, and references in this and the next succeeding section to the value of the reserve fund or of any part thereof shall be construed as references to the value of the investments and cash of which the reserve fund or that part thereof consists, as determined by the Treasury.

(5) If any question arises as to whether any liability of the Commission ought to be treated as properly chargeable to revenue account, or any claim or demand arising against the Commission ought to be treated as of an extraordinary character, it shall be referred to the Board of Trade whose decision shall be conclusive.

25.—(1) If at any time, on an estimate made by the Commission, it appears to them that their annual surplus for future financial years is likely on the average to exceed the amount which is at that time the prescribed appropriation to reserve, they may reduce any such rents within their control as are specified in the next succeeding subsection by amounts not exceeding in the aggregate one-half, or if the value of the reserve fund is then greater than the prescribed minimum reserve the whole, of the estimated excess of their annual surplus over the prescribed appropriation to reserve.

(2) The rents which may be reduced under the preceding subsection shall be any of the following at the discretion of the Commission, that is to say,—

(a) rents payable in respect of underground way-leaves, whether expressly reserved in respect thereof or not;

(6) rents payable by particular lessees working coal

in any district or part of a district which are, having regard to all the circumstances, more onerous than the average of the rents payable by lessees working coal under similar conditions in that district or part of a district; and

(c) rents payable by lessees generally working coal in any district or part of a district which are, having regard to all the circumstances, more onerous than the average of the rents payable by lessees generally working coal under similar conditions in other districts or in another part of that district:

(3) Subject as aforesaid the Commission shall not reduce any rent during the currency of the lease by which it is reserved, and in granting leases the Commission shall reserve the best rent which in their opinion can reasonably be obtained, regard being had to any power to reduce rents for the time being exercisable by them in accordance with the preceding provisions of this section, to any money laid out or to be laid out by the lessee and generally to the circumstances of the case :

Provided that—

(a) this subsection shall have effect without

prejudice to the right of the Commission, in a case in which it appears to them requisite for the proper discharge of their duty under section two of this Act so to do, to grant relief to a lessee from payment of particular instalments of rent reserved by a lease; and

(b) the Commission may reduce the rent reserved

by a lease, or may grant a lease reserving a rent less than the best rent, if they are satisfied that other provision made by the lease in consideration of their so doing affords a financial advantage substantially equivalent in value to the amount of the reduction or to the amount by which the rent is less than the best rent, as the case may be.

(4) In this section the expression “ district ” means

Part I.

General.

1. The conveyance of any coal or mine of coal to be assumed for the purposes of section four of this Act shall be a conveyance, to which all persons having any interest other than a retained interest in that coal or mine are conveying parties, to a purchaser for money or money’s worth with notice of all matters whereof notice is material, containing, in the cases mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Schedule provisions to the effect therein mentioned, but subject as aforesaid not containing any such term or provision as might have limited the application of section sixty-two or sixty-three of the Law of Property Act, 1925, to the conveyance.

2. —(1) In a case in which any of the conveying parties has, besides the interest in respect of which he is a conveying party, a retained interest in the coal or mine, he shall be deemed not to be a conveying party in respect of his retained interest.

(2) In a case in which any of the conveying parties has an interest in land that would be adversely affected by a surface servitude that the conveyance might include, or might operate to grant, for any interest, by virtue either—

(a) of section sixty-two of the Law of Property Act, 1925; or

(b) of any rule of law relating to the grant of servitudes as

servitudes of necessity;

the conveyance shall not operate further or otherwise, as regards the inclusion or the grant of that servitude or the interest (if any) for which it is to be included, than it would have operated if none of the conveying parties had had any interest in that land.

(3) In a case in which any of the conveying parties has an interest in land to which a servitude that adversely affeots the °oal or mine is annexed, or with which the benefit of a restrictive covenant that adversely affects the coal or mine runs, the conveyance shall reserve that servitude for the greatest interest for

Sections 4,6, 43.

2nd Sch. which it could be reserved by that party, or shall reserve any

—corn. right to enforce that covenant which would have subsisted in

right of that party’s interest in land with which the benefit of that covenant runs if he had not been a conveying party, as the case may be.

(4) In a case in which any of the conveying parties might, after the conveyance, be subject to any personal liability in respect of a restrictive covenant that adversely affects the coal or mine, the conveyance shall be deemed to contain a covenant entered into by the Commission with that party with the object and intent of affording to him and his successors in title a full and sufficient indemnity, but not further or otherwise, that the Commission will at all times after the vesting date duly perform and observe that restrictive covenant in relation to the coal or mine and will at all times keep that party and his successors in title effectually indemnified against all actions, proceedings, costs, charges, claims, and demands whatsoever in respect of that restrictive covenant.

3. A person having an interest vested in him without power to convey it, or having power to convey an interest with or on some consent, approval or request or on giving some notice, shall be deemed for the purposes of this Schedule to have had that power or to have received that consent, approval or request or to have given that notice, as the case may be.

Provided that, where the fee simple in the coal or mine and the fee simple in land supported thereby was vested in the same person but the term of years under a coal-mining lease was

- mine and the fee simple in land supported thereby was vested ' on the valuation date in the same person and no coal-mining ». lease of that coal or mine was then subsisting, there shall vest : : in the Commission with the coal or mine such a right as is herein-c, after mentioned, to the extent to which the existing owners of : the coal or mine were competent on the valuation date to grant such a right by virtue of their interests in that land, that is to say, a right to withdraw support from that land so far as may be reasonably requisite for the working of any coal, subject to an ~ obligation either—

(a) to pay proper compensation for damage arising from

such working to that land; or

(b) with the consent (which shall not be unreasonably with-

: held) of the person who would otherwise be entitled to

claim compensation for that damage, to make good that damage to the reasonable satisfaction of that person and without expense to him;

which obligation shall extend to buildings and works on that land whether constructed before or after the vesting date.

(2) The Commission shall on the occasion of their first exercising, or granting to a lessee the benefit of, a right vested in them by this paragraph give public notice that they propose so to do by advertisement in the London Gazette and in one or more newspapers circulating in the locality.

(c) the Commission shall have the right to have the founda-

tions inspected by a person duly authorised by them in that behalf from time to time during the construction thereof as that person may reasonably require, and if it is alleged by the Commission that the foundations are being constructed otherwise than in accordance with any plans or specifications produced or furnished to them, or otherwise than in accordance with any such plans or specifications as modified in accordance with proposals made by the Commission, as the case may be, the Commission shall notify the building owner of the matter alleged to constitute a departure therefrom, and any question arising in relation thereto shall be determined by arbitration;

Provided that, in the case of a holding belonging to an ecclesiastical corporation to which the Ecclesiastical Leasing Acts apply, a notice must be served by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and in any other case the Commission may receive a notice served by a person who has not such an interest as aforesaid if they are satisfied that, by reason of that person being concerned in the administration of the holding or on other grounds appearing to the Commission to be sufficient, it is convenient that the notice should be served by him.

(3) A notice of claim for compensation for a holding in respect of which an application for the registration of particulars has been made before the valuation date must, if the person by whom the notice is served (in this Schedule referred to as “ the claimant ”) is aware of any error or omission in such particulars relating to the registration as are mentioned in paragraph 8 of this Schedule, be accompanied by such a notice as is therein mentioned given by him, and must in any event include a statement, verified in such manner by statutory declaration or otherwise as the Commission may reasonably require, to the effect that the claimant has examined the said particulars and has made such investigation of the circumstances of the holding as is reasonably requisite for discovering any error or omission therein and is not aware of any matter, or of any other matter, as the case may be, in respect of which such a notice may be given:

Provided that, in the application of this sub-paragraph to a matter with respect to which the Commission or the Board of Trade have given such an indication as to the information material in their opinion for valuation purposes as is mentioned in section thirty-six of this Act, the omission from the particulars of matter outside the scope of the indication given may be disregarded.

(b) the Commission shall not in the case of any holding

give notice of registration under this paragraph if it appears to the Commission that there is any error or omission that renders the particulars registered in respect thereof open to objection, or that any such error or omission is likely to appear from proceedings still to be taken in connection with the registration of particulars in respect of another holding.

(2) When the Commission give notice of registration under this paragraph in relation to any holding, they shall serve a copy of the notice on the claimant, and also on the following persons, that is to say, the person, if other than the claimant, by whom the application for registration was made, any person entitled under sub-paragraph (2) (a) of paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule to the Registration Act to be notified of the application, and any other person by whom a notice has been given to the Commission under paragraph 8 of this Schedule (who are hereinafter in this Schedule referred to as “ persons intervening ”).

(3) The valuation of a holding shall be made on the basis of the particulars registered in respect thereof on the date on which notice of registration is given to the Regional Valuation Board in relation thereto under this paragraph, and as from that date the provisions of the Registration Act with respect to the rectification of the register shall cease to have effect in relation to the holding:

Provided that, if from any information in the possession of the Regional Valuation Board it appears to them that there is in the particulars so registered as aforesaid an error or omission of material importance for valuation purposes, they may, at any time before they have settled their draft valuation of the holding, notify the Commission that they are of that opinion and thereupon the said provisions shall again come into effect, and, if any alteration is made thereunder in the particulars so registered as aforesaid, the valuation shall be made on the basis of the particulars as altered.

Provided that no payment on account shall be made under this paragraph, except with the consent of the person entitled, either—

(3) A payment on account made under this paragraph before the vesting date, together with interest thereon for the period between the date on which the payment is made and the vesting date at the rate of three pounds per cent, per annum lees income tax at the standard rate, shall be treated in account as a payment on account of the capital of the compensation made on the vesting date, and the said interest shall be deemed for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts to be paid on each anniversary of the date of the payment on account that occurs before the vesting date and on the vesting date and accordingly shall be treated as a proper deduction from income.

(4) A payment on account made under this paragraph after the vesting date shall be treated in account as a payment made primarily in or towards discharge of any interest on the compensation that is due at the date of the payment, and the residue thereof, if any, shall be treated in account as a payment on account of the capital of the compensation.

20.—(1) If in the case of any valuation region the relevant certificates have not become conclusive under paragraph 17 of this Schedule at the vesting date, the claimant or any person intervening in respect of a holding in the region for which compensation is to be payable may require the Commission to make, at the expiration of each quarter thereafter until the certificates become conclusive, a payment on account under the last preceding paragraph of an amount not less than that specified in this paragraph, and, as from the date of any such requirement, the Commission shall be liable to make payments to the person entitled to the compensation for the holding accordingly.

at that date:

Provided that, if before the beginning of any quarter at the expiration of which a quarterly payment becomes due any payment on account has been made in respect of the holding

to the reversion immediately expectant on the lease, in respect of coal, mines of coal and acquired property and rights comprised therein, during the year ending on the vesting date (or, in the case of a lease that has expired before the vesting date, during the last year of its subsistence), less

(b) the mineral rights duty and royalties welfare levy

payable or allowable by that person in respect of that rent;

so however that that amount shall be subject to the reduction mentioned in the proviso to the last preceding sub-paragraph in the case therein mentioned:

Provided that, in a case in which there is reasonable ground for apprehending that, if a payment of the amount so ascertained were made, the aggregate of that payment and of any other payment on account theretofore made might exceed the aggregate of the compensation for the holding and the interest thereon, the Commission may withhold that payment.

(4) In a case in which the proviso to the last preceding sub-paragraph has effect and in a case of a holding other than a reversion, if at a date on which a quarterly payment becomes due the draft valuation of the holding has not been settled, that payment shall be deferred until the draft has been settled and the amount thereof shall be ascertained under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph.

months beginning on the first day of July, October, January or April;

(2) In the case of a holding that consists of or comprises an estate or other interest subject to a settlement within the meaning of the Settled Land Act, 1925, or to a trust for sale the proceeds whereof are subject to a settlement by way of succession, the trustees of the settlement or any Court having jurisdiction in relation to the execution of the trusts of the settlement, and in the case of the Court on the application of any beneficiary under the settlement, may require and cause the compensation, or the part thereof attributable to that estate or other interest, as the case may be, to be laid out, invested, accumulated, and paid in such manner as, in the judgment of the trustees or of the Court, as the case may be, will give to the beneficiaries under the settlement the like benefit therefrom as they might lawfully have had from that estate or other interest, or as near thereto as may be, regard being had to the terms of the settlement and to all relevant circumstances affecting the premises in which the holding subsisted, including—

(a) the terms of any subsisting coal-mining lease and the

operation of any provision therein contained as to undergettings, short workings, and other like matters;

(ii) subject as aforesaid no part of the income of the compensation shall be required or caused by virtue of this sub-paragraph to be set aside as capital of the settlement.

(3) In the case of a holding that comprises an estate or other interest subject to a mortgage, the compensation (other than any part thereof that is attributable to an estate or other interest not subject to the mortgage) shall be held and disposed of in like manner as if it had been money arising under a power of sale conferred by the mortgage.

(4) In the case of a holding that could have been sold as mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph eighteen of this Schedule under powers conferred by the Ecclesiastical Leasing Acts, the compensation paid in respect thereof and the income thereof shall be held and disposed of, and the said Acts shall have effect, in like manner as if the compensation had been money paid to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners upon a sale under the said Acts of the premises in which the holding subsisted:

Provided that—

(a) if the holding was a reversion and the rent reserved

by the lease was subject, by virtue of a scheme in force under the said Acts, to a direction for the payment thereof to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for the benefit of their common fund, the direction shall have effect in relation to the income of the compensation as it had effect in relation to the rent; and

(b) where a payment on account of the compensation

for the holding has been made under paragraph 19 of this Schedule before the vesting date, the net income accruing before the vesting date from the investment of the sum paid shall be set aside as capital of the compensation.

FOURTH SCHEDULE.

1.—(1) A lease consolidation scheme, and the single lease to be granted pursuant thereto, shall be prepared by the Commission in agreement with the working lessee.

(2) The said lease may comprise, in addition to the coal and mines of coal in the colliery area, any other premises that are to vest in the Commission by virtue of Part I of this Act and are comprised in any of the subsisting working leases, and may, if the person competent to grant a lease thereof consents to the inclusion thereof but not otherwise, comprise also any premises that are so to vest but are not comprised in any of the subsisting working leases and any premises that are not so to vest.

(3) The said lease shall not (except with his consent) impose upon any person any liability not being a liability to which he would have been subject by virtue of a subsisting working lease, or render more onerous whether as regards extent, duration, terms, conditions or otherwise, any liability to which any person would have been so subject, or deprive him of the benefit of any covenant, condition or provision of a subsisting working lease affecting or relating to any premises other than coal or a mine of coal.

2. —(1) The said lease shall be a lease granted, in the case of any premises to be comprised therein, being premises comprised in any of the subsisting working leases, out of the freehold reversion in those premises, or, if two or more coal-mining leases thereof by way of lease and under-lease are subsisting, out of the leasehold reversion in those premises immediately expectant on the subsisting working lease, and accordingly the term to be granted in the case of premises that are so subject to two or more leases shall not be longer than the residue of the term for which that immediate reversion is held.

(2) The said lease shall, notwithstanding anything in subsection (2) of section twelve of this Act, not include any premises that are comprised in a subsisting working lease being an underlease in a case in which interests in those premises arising under a superior lease are to be retained by virtue of a direction under subsection (2) of section five of this Act.

(2) In the case of a reversion that is a leasehold reversion, the standard amount of rent in respect thereof shall be determined on the basis of the net rent, that is to say the amount which the reversioner would have been entitled to receive, less the amount that he would have been liable to pay, by way of rent in respect of premises that are to be comprised in the single lease to be granted pursuant to the scheme.

6. If any person upon whom a copy of a lease consolidation scheme is required to be served objects to any of the provisions included in the scheme under sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, he may require those provisions to be determined by an arbitrator selected by agreement between the Commission and all the persons upon whom a copy of the scheme is required to be served, or, in default of agreement, by the Lord Chancellor in the case of England or the Lord President of the Court of Session in the case of Scotland.

(2) A lease executed under this paragraph shall be deemed to have taken effect on the date of the taking effect of the scheme, and as from that date the subsisting working leases shall be deemed to have been determined so far as regards the premises comprised in the lease so executed.

(3) The provisions of section eleven of this Act shall have effect in relation to a severance effected by the determination of a subsisting working lease under the last preceding sub-paragraph as regards a part of the premises comprised therein, as they have effect in relation to such a severance as is mentioned in that section of the reversion on a lease subsisting on the vesting date, so however that the apportionment of the rent reserved by the subsisting working lease shall be made on the basis of the apportionment made for the purpose of the determination under this Schedule of the standard amount of rent.

8.—(1) The person entitled by virtue of the provisions inserted in a lease consolidation scheme under sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 3 of this Schedule to recover the rent reserved by the single lease granted pursuant thereto shall be deemed to be the immediate lessor for the purposes of the provisions of 10 Edw. 7. & section twenty-four of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, that 1 Geo. 5. c. 8. relate (as originally enacted and as applied by Part III of the Mining Industry Act, 1926) to the assessment, collection and recovery of mineral rights duty and royalties welfare levy, in respect of the period between the date on which the lease takes effect and the vesting date.

(2) The powers conferred by the provisions inserted as aforesaid shall be exercisable during the period aforesaid as regards the matters to which those provisions relate, as statutory powers, to the exclusion of any other power that might otherwise have been exercisable as regards those matters.

(6) if the amount of that rent, after such deduction as aforesaid, is greater than the said standard amounts, distribute that rent, after deducting the sum payable to the Commission under subsection (6) of section twelve of this Act, among the persons and in the proportions aforesaid.

(4) A superior reversioner who is entitled to a payment under the preceding sub-paragraph in respect of any premises for any period shall not be entitled to recover from his immediate lessee any rent in respect of those premises for that period.

Development Board shall, within six weeks of receiving such a scheme, submit the scheme to the Minister with its own observations thereon.

(3) Where any such scheme has been submitted to the Minister, the Minister shall cause to be published in the London and Edinburgh Gazettes and in such other manner as he thinks best for informing the persons affected, notice of the submission of the scheme, of the place where copies thereof may be obtained (on payment of such fee as may be prescribed by the notice) and inspected, and of the time (which shall not be less than six weeks after the publication in the Gazettes) within which objections and representations with respect to the scheme may be made.

(4) Every objection shall be sent to the Minister in writing and must state the grounds of the objection and the specific modifications required.

(5) The Minister, after considering any scheme duly submitted to him and the observations (if any) of the Development Board thereon and any objections and representations duly made with respect thereto, and after holding such inquiries (if any) as he thinks fit, may make such modifications in the scheme as he thinks proper:

Provided that, where an objection has been duly made to the scheme by any person affected thereby and has not been withdrawn, the Minister, unless he considers the objection to be frivolous, or unless he has modified the scheme as required by the objection, shall, before taking any further action under this section, direct a public inquiry to be held and consider the report of the person who held the inquiry.

tract there shall be the five variants mentioned in the next succeeding subsection.

(2) The said variants are as- follows, that is to say:—

(a) a variant, in this Act referred to as “ the nominated buyer variant,” to be used in the case of pigs sold to a curer whom the seller has duly nominated as the person to whom he wishes those pigs to be sold;

(b) a variant, in this Act referred to as “ the open

offer variant,” to be used where the seller has not so nominated a curer and does not desire to avail himself of the group contract arrangements mentioned in the next succeeding paragraph;

(c) a variant, in this Act referred to as “ the group

contract variant,” to be used where a producer has not so nominated a curer as aforesaid and desires to avail himself of any arrangements made by or under authority of the Pigs Marketing Board (in this Act referred to as “ group contract arrangements ”) under which two or more sellers are to employ the same agent for the purpose of arranging the deliveries under their respective contracts;

1938.

(d) a variant, in this Act referred to as “ the transferred pig variant,” to be used where a registered producer of pigs has exercised his right of nomination aforesaid but the pigs are nevertheless being sold to another curer; and

(e) a variant, in this Act referred to as “ the trans-

ferred pig (producer-curers) variant,” to be used in the circumstances specified in the provisions of this Act relating to curers who produce pigs:

Provided that, where any of the main forms of contract provides for a price calculated by reference to dead weight, a seller shall not be deemed to have duly nominated a curer as the person to whom he wishes pigs to be sold unless he has specified the premises at which he wishes the carcases of those pigs to be graded.

(3) In the case of each main form of contract, all the said variants shall be identical except for the differences specified in the following provisions of this section.

(4) The nominated buyer variant of any of the main forms of contract which provides for a price calculated by reference to dead weight shall also provide (without prejudice to any other provision thereof relating to the place at which the carcases of the pigs are to be graded) for an addition of sixpence to the price of each pig the carcase of which is graded at premises other than those specified as aforesaid by the seller as the premises at which he wishes the carcases to be graded.

The said addition of sixpence is hereafter in this Act referred to as “ a change of premises premium ”.

(5) The open offer variant shall be identical with the nominated buyer variant except that it shall not contain any provision for a change of premises premium but must provide—

(a) for the addition to the price of each pig delivered thereunder of a specified sum, hereinafter referred to as “ the allocation premium ”; and

(b) for the Pigs Marketing Board guaranteeing to

the seller in a specified manner and subject to specified conditions the performance of all the obligations of the purchaser.

(a) provisions relating to the identity, powers, rights and duties of the agent;

(h) provisions designed to secure that, as between the various producers who employ that agent, the burden of any particular class of risk or expense is shared in a specified manner;

(c) provisions designed to secure that where several producers who employ the same agent enter into contracts with one curer, that curer is, as nearly as may be, in the same position as respects deliveries under those contracts as he would be in if all the pigs to which those contracts relate were being sold to him under one contract in the open offer variant of the main form of contract in question.

(7) The transferred pig variant shall be identical with the open offer variant, except that the allocation premium must be one shilling of which sixpence must be made payable to the Pigs Marketing Board.

The said sum of sixpence shall be so payable for the benefit of the curer nominated by the seller as the person to whom he wished the pigs to be sold.

(8) The transferred pig (producer-curers) variant shall be identical with the open offer variant, except that the allocation premium must be one shilling.

(9) If no factory rationalisation scheme has come into force by the expiration of two years from the passing of this Act or such lesser period as the Minister may order, or if such a scheme which comes into force oeases to have effect by reason of an order for the revocation thereof, there shall be determined, in relation to each of the main forms of contract, the following three variants only, that is to say, the nominated buyer variant, the open offer variant and the group contract variant.

Proceedings subsequent to determination of forms of contract.

23.—(1) Where forms of long contract have been determined, the Pigs Marketing Board shall forthwith publish, in such manner as it thinks best calculated to bring the matter to the notice of registered producers of pigs and registered curers, a notice stating that the forms have been determined, and specifying a place at which registered producers and registered curers can obtain

copies thereof free of charge, and inviting registered Past IV. producers to declare to the Board within a specified time —com. and in a specified manner, in relation to each of the main forms of contract, if there is more than one—

(a) the quantities of pigs, of each of the descriptions

mentioned in the form of contract, which they are respectively prepared to sell to registered curers for delivery during the contract period under a long contract or long contracts;

(b) the times at which they are prepared to deliver

the pigs thereunder;

(c) whether or not they desire to avail themselves of

the group contract arrangements; and

(d) whether or not they wish, in relation to all or any of the pigs which they are willing to contract to deliver (not being pigs contracted to be delivered under contracts in the group contract variant of the form of contract), to nominate a curer as the person to whom they wish the pigs to be sold, and, if so, what is his name and address and (in the case of pigs to be sold for a price calculated by reference to their dead weight) what are the premises at which J* ' e carcases of the pigs in question

(2) The said notice shall also embody a statement of the circumstances, if any (being such circumstances as the Board may determine), in winch, where a producer has duly nominated a curer as the person to whom he wishes pigs to be sold, the Board may nevertheless cause those pigs to be sold to another curer :

Provided that, if no factory rationalisation scheme has come into force by the expiration of two years from the passing of this Act or such lesser period as the Minister may order, or if such a scheme winch comes into force ceases to have effect by reason of an order for the revocation thereof, the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall cease to have effect and, where the producer has so nominated a curer, the Board shall in no circumstances be entitled to cause the pigs in question to be sold otherwise than to that curer.

(3) Where, within the time and in the manner specified in the notice aforesaid, a registered producer

Act, 1938.

declares to the Pigs Marketing Board that he is willing to sell pigs under long contracts, the declaration shall, subject to the following provisions of this section, operate as an irrevocable authority to the Board to enter on his behalf into such contracts or contracts in the appropriate variant or variants of the main form or main forms of contract as the Board may determine.

(4) The authority conferred on the Board as aforesaid shall be so exercised as to secure that no producer is, under the contracts entered into by virtue of that authority, under obligation to deliver, either altogether or at any time within the contract period, more pigs or more pigs of any description than he has declared to the Board that he is willing to contract to deliver either altogether or at that time under long contracts (or, if there is more than one main form of contract, under long contracts in variants of that one of those main forms which is specified in that behalf in his declaration).

(5) The contracts shall be made with such registered curer or curers as the Board may determine, so however, that in so far as a producer has nominated a curer as the person to whom he wishes pigs to be sold, the Board shall not cause those pigs to be sold otherwise than to that curer except in the circumstances specified in a statement embodied by virtue of subsection (2) of this section in the notice published under subsection (1) thereof.

(6) Where the Board reasonably believes that a producer has declared that he is willing to sell more pigs or more pigs of any description than he would, apart from circumstances beyond his control, be in a position to deliver out of pigs bred or purchased when not more than sixteen weeks old by him or his predecessor in his business and thereafter kept on premises in Great Britain occupied for the purposes of that business by him or his predecessor therein, the Board shall in any case restrict the pigs or, as the case may be, the pigs of that description, which he contracts to sell under long contracts, to the number of pigs or pigs of that description which in the opinion of the Board he will, apart from such circumstances, be in a position so to deliver:

Provided that the Board may by general or special determination from time to time exempt from this subsection such producers as may be specified in the determination.

1938. Bacon Industry Ch. 71.

Act, 1938.

(7) The Pigs Marketing Board shall so exercise its powers of making contracts under this section as to secure that the total quantity of pigs, or of pigs of any description, contracted to be delivered in the contract period in question under long contracts does not exceed such quantity as the Development Board may direct in relation to pigs generally, or, as the case may be, in relation to pigs of that description.

24.—(1) As soon as may be after the end of every contract period, the Bacon Marketing Board shall ascertain in relation to each registered curer to whom allocated or transferred pigs have been delivered—

(a) the amount which bears to the total of the alloca-

tion premiums paid or payable, or deemed for the purposes of this section to have been paid, by the buyers of allocated or transferred pigs the same proportion as the number of allocated or transferred pigs delivered to him bears to the total number of allocated or transferred pigs;

(b) the total amount of the allocation premiums

paid or payable, or deemed for the purposes of this section to have been paid, by him in respect of allocated or transferred pigs.

For the purposes of this section, the expression “ allocated or transferred pigs ” means, in relation to a contract period, pigs delivered under long contracts for that period, being pigs in respect of which allocation premiums or change of premises premiums are payable; and a registered curer who has paid or by whom there is payable a change of premises premium in respect of a pig, shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to have paid an allocation premium of one shilling in respect thereof.

(2) There shall be paid to the Bacon Marketing Board by, or by the Bacon Marketing Board to, each such curer (according as in his case the amount mentioned in paragraph (a) of the last preceding subsection exceeds or falls short of the amount mentioned in paragraph (6) thereof) a sum equal to the difference between those amounts.

(3) No sum shall be payable under subsection (2) of this section in respect of a contract period until three months after the conclusion of that period, but the

Board may make to, and by resolution require from, —cont. buyers of allocated or transferred pigs such payments on account of the sum which the Board estimates will become payable by or to those buyers respectively under that subsection as it may think proper, and any payment required from a curer by such a resolution shall be a debt due to the Board and shall be recoverable accordingly; and any necessary adjustments shall be made at the expiration of the said three months.

Safeguards for producers and curers as respects long

contracts.

25.—(1) If after a determination of the forms of long contract has been made with respect to a contract period it is agreed between the two Marketing Boards, or, in default of agreement, decided by arbitration between them, that the determination is such that the general body of producers or the general body of curers cannot reasonably be expected to contract thereunder or that the performance or further performance of any contracts which may be or have been made under the determination will be unreasonably onerous, the determination shall stand annulled.

As respects anything to be done by virtue of this subsection, the two Marketing Boards shall act independently of the Development Board.

(2) Where a determination stands annulled as aforesaid, the Pigs Marketing Board, in agreement with the Bacon Marketing Board, may, within one week of the date of the award or agreement annulling the determination, or, if those Boards fail to agree within that period, the Development Board may thereafter, make a new determination with respect to the contract period, or with respect to so much thereof as remains unexpired on a date to be specified in the new determination, and the provisions of this Part of this Act shall with the necessary modifications apply with respect to such a determination as if it were a determination made in accordance with the provisions of the last preceding section.

(3) Any contract made in pursuance of an annulled determination before the annulment thereof shall, on the expiration of eight weeks from the date of the award or agreement annulling the determination, or as from the beginning of the period with respect to which a new determination has effect, whichever first occurs, become void:

Provided that—

(a) if the contract provided for monthly deliveries,

the time at which it is to become void as aforesaid shall be the end of the month during which it would under this subsection become void if it were a contract which did not provide for monthly deliveries;

(b) the avoidance of a contract under this sub-

section shall not affect the rights or liabilities of the parties thereto with respect to pigs which the producer has delivered or was obliged to deliver before the date on which it becomes void.

Special Provision for first three Contract .

26.—(1) The provisions of this and the succeeding sections of this Part of this Act shall have effect with respect to the first three contract periods.

(2) Each form of contract shall—

(a) fix for each month the price which (subject

to the special additions and subtractions provided for by the subsequent provisions of this Part of this Act, to the addition of any allocation or change of premises premium, to any deduction falling to be made under the contract in respect of any undertaking by the buyer to bear losses from death or damage during transit or from disease, and to any addition falling to be made under the contract in respect of loss of weight dining transit) is to be paid per score of twenty pounds dead weight in the case of a standard pig duly delivered in that month free on rail at the railway station nearest to the seller’s premises or free on board at the place of loading nearest to the seller’s premises;

(b) so fix the said monthly prices that the

average of the twelve figures fixed amounts in the first contract period to twelve shillings and sixpence, in the second contract period to twelve shillings and fivepence, and in the third contract period to twelve shillings and threepence:

Provided that nothing in this section shall prevent any form of contract from providing for the payment of higher or lower prices for pigs which are not standard pigs or which are delivered otherwise than free on rail or free on board as aforesaid, or which, in pursuance of an option reserved to one of the parties, are delivered in a month other than that in which they would have had to be delivered if no such option had been exercised.

(3) In this section the expression “ standard pig” means a pig of such weight, quality and kind as may be prescribed by regulations of the Minister.

(4) The total quantity of pigs contracted to be delivered in a contract period under long contracts shall not exceed, in the first contract period two million one hundred thousand pigs, in the second contract period two million four hundred thousand pigs, and in the third contract period two million five hundred thousand pigs; and if, in the case of any contract period, documents which would but for the provisions of this subsection be valid long contracts are executed which, taken together, purport to provide for delivery of a quantity of pigs exceeding the limit aforesaid, those of the said documents which were last executed by the Board shall be void until the quantity is so reduced that the said limit is no longer exceeded.

27.—(1) There shall be added to, or, as the case may be, subtracted from, the price per score of twenty pounds dead weight which would otherwise be paid under a long contract in respect of any pig due to be delivered in any month one hundred and three one hundred and twentieths of the amount by which the price for that month of the standard ration for pigs exceeds, or, as the case may be falls short of, eight shillings and sixpence.

(2) In this section the expression “ the price of the standard ration for pigs” means in relation to any month a sum ascertained by the Minister as follows:—

(a) before the beginning of the contract period during which the month occurs, he shall, in accordance with regulations to be made by him with the consent of the Treasury, determine the composition of a ration which in his opinion is suitable to be taken as the standard ration of feeding stuffs for pigs for the purposes of this section;

(6) before the beginning of the month in question he shall, in accordance with regulations so made, determine what, in the sixteen weeks ending with the Wednesday next preceding the fifteenth day of the preceding month, was the average cost per hundredweight of the standard ration; and

(c) the average cost so determined shall be deemed to be the price of the standard ration for pigs.

(3) In ascertaining the amount to be added to or deducted from the price to be paid in respect of any pig in accordance with the provisions of this section, the amount to be added or deducted per score of twenty pounds dead weight shall be calculated to the nearest penny, any odd halfpenny being left out of account.

28.—(1) Where pigs are delivered to and accepted by a curer under a long contract, there shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be paid by the Minister to the curer out of moneys provided by Parliament the sums following, that is to say,—

(a) an amount equal to any additions to the price of those pigs falling to be made under the provisions of the last preceding section;

(b) in respect of each hundredweight of the bacon produced from those pigs on premises in respect of which a producer’s licence, other than a small curer’s licence, is in force, a sum equal to the amount, if any, by which the ascertained bacon price falls below, in the case of the first contract period ninety-four shillings and nine-pence per hundredweight, in the case of the second contract period ninety-three shillings and ninepence per hundredweight and in the case of the third contract period ninety-one shillings and ninepence per hundredweight.

(2) Where pigs are delivered to and accepted by a curer under such a contract as aforesaid, there shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be paid by the curer to the Minister the sums following, that is to say,—

(3) No amount shall be payable in respect of any pig under paragraph (a) of subsection (1), or paragraph (o) of subsection (2), of this section, unless bacon has been produced from the pig on premises in respect of which a producer’s licence, other than a small curer’s licence, is in force; and where the weight of the bacon produced on such premises from a pig is less than the prescribed fraction of the dead weight thereof, any amount payable under either of those paragraphs shall be reduced by applying thereto a fraction the numerator whereof is the number of pounds comprised in the weight of the bacon produced and the denominator whereof is the number of pounds comprised in the prescribed fraction of the dead weight of the pig; and except so far as the contrary is proved to the Minister by the curer in accordance with regulations made under this section, it shall be presumed—

(a) for all the purposes of subsection (1) of this

section, that no bacon has been produced from a pig on such premises;

average price per hundredweight at which whole sides of green Wiltshire style bacon of all selections produced by the tank cure process from pigs produced in Great Britain (being bacon produced on premises specified from time to time by the Minister, after consultation with the Bacon Marketing Board, acting independently of the Development Board) were sold by the curers thereof during the month beginning with the sixteenth day of the month during which, under the provisions of the contract, the pig is due to be delivered; and

(5) the expression “ the prescribed fraction” means four-fifths or such other fraction as may from time to time be prescribed by regulations under this section.

(b) directing that in the case of bacon other than

Wiltshire style bacon there shall be added to the weight of the bacon an amount designed to correspond to the weight lost by the removal of bones and skin not removed in the case of bacon cured in the said style;

(c) specifying the times at which payments are to

be made under this section; and

(d) specifying the documents and other information which a curer is to produce in connection with any claim by or against him under this section.

(2) If any registered curer produces or sells any bacon in contravention of any determination of the Bacon Marketing Board under this section, that Board shall by resolution impose upon, and shall recover from, him a monetary penalty not exceeding one hundred pounds or five pounds for each hundredweight of bacon so produced or sold, whichever is the larger.

(3) If no factory rationalisation scheme has come into force by the expiration of two years from the passing of this Act or such lesser period as the Minister may order, or if any such scheme ceases to have effect by reason of an order for the revocation thereof, the provisions of this section shall cease to have effect.

(4) If it is represented to the Minister by the Bacon Marketing Board, by the Pigs Marketing Board, by the prescribed number of registered curers or by registered curers who in a prescribed period produce a prescribed proportion of the bacon produced in Great Britain, that any direction given by the Development Board as to the manner in which the powers conferred by this section are to be exercised is inequitable or is not in the interests of the bacon industry or of the

(3) If, when a request has been made under the last preceding subsection, the circumstances are such that the Board has the right, notwithstanding the request, to make long contracts on behalf of the curer for the sale to any other registered curer of any of the pigs covered by the request, and the Board exercises that right, the contract shall be made in the transferred pig (producer- curers) variant of the form of contract.

(3) The validity of anything done by the Development Board shall not be called in question by reason only that it is in contravention of any principle so formulated, but where a registered producer of pigs or a registered curer suffers damage by reason of any act or omission of the Development Board which amounts to a contravention of any such principle, he shall be entitled to recover from the Development Board such sum by way of compensation as represents the damage which he has suffered by reason of the contravention.

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3) of the said section nine as so applied, it shall be the duty of the Minister to direct the committee of investigation to consider any complaint made to him as to the operation of the said provisions of this Act or of any factory rationalisation scheme, being a complaint made by either of the two Marketing Boards, by the prescribed number of registered curers, by registered curers who in a prescribed period have produced the prescribed proportion of the bacon produced in Great Britain, by the prescribed number of holders of producers’ licences or by the holders of producers’ licences in respect of premises on which there is together produced in a prescribed period the prescribed proportion of the bacon produced in Great Britain.

As respects the making of any such complaint, the two Marketing Boards shall act independently of the Development Board.

(3) Subsection (5) of the said section nine shall not have effect in relation to the said provisions of this Act or of any such factory rationalisation scheme, but if the committee of investigation reports to the Minister that any provision of a factory rationalisation scheme or any act or omission of the Development Board is contrary to the interest of consumers of bacon or is contrary to the interest of any persons affected by this Act and is not in the public interest, the Minister may—

(a) by order revoke or amend the factory rationalisation scheme, if any;

(b) by order direct the Board to take such steps

to rectify the matter as may be specified in the order, whereupon it shall be the duty of the Board forthwith to comply with the order:

Provided that the Board, if it appears that the amount specified as aforesaid will be insufficient or more than sufficient to make good to it the said expenses, may amend the determination by fixing a higher or lower amount, and thereupon the determination shall be deemed always to have had effect as so amended, and any sums underpaid by any curer to the Board shall be recoverable from turn by the Board as a debt and any sums overpaid by any curer shall be repaid or allowed to him by the Board.

(6) The Bacon Marketing Board shall, at least six weeks before the beginning of the period to which a determination under the foregoing provisions of this section relates, publish a draft of the determination in such manner as it thinks best adapted for the purpose of bringing the matter to the notice of the curers affected, and shall consider any representations made to it during the four weeks following the date of the publication of the draft by or on behalf of any of those curers, and may then make the determination either in the form of the draft or with modifications.

(7) If any registered curer causes any pig to be transported or insured in contravention of any determination in force under this section, the Bacon Marketing Board shall by resolution impose upon, and shall recover from, him a monetary penalty not exceeding one pound for each pig so transported or insured.

For the purposes of this subsection—

(a) a curer who fails to insure a pig when he is required to do so by a determination shall be deemed to have caused that pig to be insured in contravention of that determination;

(b) a curer who contravenes any provision of a

determination requiring him to act in a particular manner as respects the exercise of an option shall be deemed to have caused each pig affected by the contravention to be transported in contravention of the determination.

(9) References in the foregoing provisions of this section to pigs shall, in relation to pigs slaughtered before being transported by or on behalf of the curer, be construed as including references to the carcases thereof.

(10) Any sum duly required to be paid to the Bacon Marketing Board by a determination under the foregoing provisions of this section shall be recoverable by that Board as a debt.

(11) The Bacon Marketing Board may—

(a) contract with any person for the carriage by him, on behalf of any registered curer, of pigs or carcases of pigs;

(b) enter into an arrangement with any person

whereby that person undertakes to contract on specified terms with any registered curer, or any registered curer of a specified class, for the carriage on behalf of that curer of pigs or carcases of pigs;

(c) enter into an arrangement with any person

whereby that person undertakes to insure any registered curer, or any registered curer of a specified class, against loss in respect of pigs by death, or damage during transit, or by disease;

(i) a curer shall not be bound to avail himself of anything done by the Board under this subsection; and

any pigs or carcases, he shall repay to the Board any sums which the Board may become liable to pay to any other person in connection with the carriage of those pigs or carcases.

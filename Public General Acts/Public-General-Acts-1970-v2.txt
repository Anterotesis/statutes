PARTI Feudal Reform

Act 1970

(2) For the purposes of this section and of section 2 of this Act, a land obligation is an obligation relating to land which is enforceable by a proprietor of an interest in land, by virtue of his being such proprietor, and which is binding upon a proprietor of another interest in that land, or of an interest in other land, by virtue of his being such proprietor.

For the purposes mentioned in this subsection, an obligation includes a future or contingent obligation, an obligation to defray or contribute towards some cost, an obligation to refrain from doing something, and an obligation to permit or suffer something to be done or maintained.

(3) Subject to the provisions of this section and of section 2 of this Act, the Lands Tribunal, on the application of any person who, in relation to a land obligation, is a burdened proprietor, may from time to time by order vary or discharge the obligation wholly or partially in relation to the interest in land in respect of which the application is made, on being satisfied that in all the circumstances,

(a) by reason of changes in the character of the land affected

by the obligation or of the neighbourhood thereof or other circumstances which the Tribunal may deem material, the obligation is or has become unreasonable or inappropriate; or

(b) the obligation is unduly burdensome compared with

any benefit resulting or which would result from its performance; or

(c) the existence of the obligation impedes some reasonable

use of the land.

(4) An order varying or discharging a land obligation under this section may direct the applicant to pay, to any person who in relation to that obligation is a benefited proprietor, such sum as the Lands Tribunal may think it just to award under one, but not both, of the following heads—

(i) a sum to compensate for any substantial loss or dis-

advantage suffered by the proprietor as such benefited proprietor in consequence of the variation or discharge; or

(ii) a sum to make up for any effect which the obligation

produced, at the time when it was imposed, in reducing the consideration then paid or made payable for the interest in land affected by it; but the Tribunal may refuse to vary or discharge a land obligation on the ground specified in subsection (3)(c) of this section if they are of the opinion that, due to exceptional circumstances related to amenity or otherwise, money would not be an adequate compensation for any loss or disadvantage which a benefited proprietor would suffer from the variation or discharge.

(6) On the taking effect of an order under this section varying or discharging to any extent a land obligation, any irritant or resolutive clause or other condition relating to the enforcement of the obligation shall, in relation to any act or omission occurring after the date of such taking effect, be effective (if at all) only in so far as it would have been effective if the obligation had to that extent been varied or discharged by the person entitled to enforce the obligation; and any such added or substituted provision as is referred to in subsection (5) of this section shall be enforceable in the same manner as die obligation to the variation or discharge of which it relates.

2.—(1) On an application under section 1 of this Act, the Provisions Lands Tribunal shall give such notice thereof, whether by f1I^<J'nen|ary way of advertisement or otherwise, as may be prescribed, to to on ’ the persons who, in relation to the obligation which is the subject of the application, appear to them to be either benefited or burdened proprietors, and to such other persons as the Tribunal may think fit.

(2) In an application to the Lands Tribunal under section 1 of this Act, any person who, in relation to the obligation which is the subject of the application, is either a burdened or a benefited proprietor, shall be entitled, within such time as may be prescribed, to oppose or make representations in relation to the application, and the Tribunal shall allow any such person, and may allow any other person who appears to them to be affected by the obligation or by its proposed variation or discharge, to be heard in relation to the application.

(3) An order made under section 1 of this Act shall take effect in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed.

(4) Where an order made under section 1 of this Act which has taken effect is duly recorded, it shall be binding on all persons having interest

(5) Where a land obligation is first created, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, in a conveyance, deed, instrument or writing, no application shall be brought under section 1 of this Act in relation thereto until the expiry of two years after the date of its creation.

1970 CHAPTER 41

An Act to prevent discrimination, as regards terms and conditions of employment, between men and women.

[29th May 1970]

Be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

Requirement of equal treatment for men and women in same employment.

1.—(1) The provisions of this section shall have effect with a view to securing that employers give equal treatment as regards terms and conditions of employment to men and to women, that is to say that (subject to the provisions of this section and of section 6 below)—

(a) for men and women employed on like work the terms

and conditions of one sex are not in any respect less favourable than those of the other; and

(b) for men and women employed on work rated as

equivalent (within the meaning of subsection (5) below) the terms and conditions of one sex are not less favourable than those of the other in any respect in which the terms and conditions of both are determined by the rating of their work.

The following provisions of this section and section 2 below are framed with reference to women and their treatment relative to men, but are to be read as applying equally in a converse case to men and their treatment relative to women.

(2) It shall be a term of the contract under which a woman is employed at an establishment in Great Britain that she shall be given equal treatment with men in the same employment, that is to say men employed by her employer or any associated employer at the same establishment or at establishments in Great Britain which include that one and at which common terms and conditions of employment are observed either generally or for employees of the relevant classes.

Equal Pay Act 1970

c. 41

1367

(3) Where a woman is employed at an establishment in Great Britain otherwise than under a contract which includes (directly or by reference to a collective agreement or otherwise) a term satisfying subsection (2) above, the terms and conditions of her employment shall include an implied term giving effect to that subsection.

(4) A woman is to be regarded as employed on like work with men if,but only if,her work and theirs is of the same or a broadly similar nature, and the differences (if any) between the things she does and the things they do are not of practical importance in relation to terms and conditions of employment; and accordingly in comparing her work with theirs regard shall be had to the frequency or otherwise with which any such differences occur in practice as well as to the nature and extent of the differences.

(5) A woman is to be regarded as employed on work rated as equivalent with that of any men if, but only if, her job and their job have been given an equal value, in terms of the demand made on a worker under various headings (for instance effort, skill, decision), on a study undertaken with a view to evaluating in those terms the jobs to be done by all or any of the employees in an undertaking or group of undertakings, or would have been given an equal value but for the evaluation being made on a system setting different values for men and women on the same demand under any heading.

(6) Subject to the following subsections, for purposes of this section—

(a) “ employed ” means employed under a contract of

service or of apprenticeship or a contract personally to execute any work or labour, and related expressions shall be construed accordingly;

(b) a person is to be regarded as employed at an establish-

ment if he is employed to work in the establishment or, in the case of a person employed to work otherwise than in an establishment, if his employment is carried out from the establishment;

(c) two employers are to be treated as associated if one is

a company of which the other (directly or indirectly) has control or if both are companies of which a third person (directly or indirectly) has control.

(7) A person is not to be regarded for purposes of this section as employed at an establishment in Great Britain if his employment is wholly or mainly outside Great Britain; but—

(a) employment on aircraft or hovercraft registered in Great Britain shall not be regarded as employment

1368

Equal Pay Act 1970

c. 41

outside Great Britain, unless it is wholly outside Great Britain;

(b) persons employed to work on board a ship registered in Great Britain, unless the employment is wholly outside Great Britain, are to be regarded as employed at an establishment in Great Britain, and the ship shall be deemed to be the establishment.

(8) This section shall apply to persons employed under or for purposes of a Minister of the Crown or government department, otherwise than as members of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown or of any women’s service administered by the Defence Council, as it would apply if they were employed by a private person.

Disputes 2.—(1) Any claim in respect of the operation of a term

as to, and included in a woman’s contract of employment or implied in her of reqSementterms conditions of employment as mentioned in section of equal 1(3) above (in this section referred to as an “ equal pay clause ”),

treatment. including a claim for arrears of remuneration or damages in

respect of a failure to comply with an equal pay clause, may be referred to and determined by an industrial tribunal, and may be so referred either by the person making the claim or by the person against whom it is made.

(2) Where it appears to the Secretary of State that there may be a question whether the employer of any women is or has been failing to comply with their equal pay clauses, but that it is not reasonable to expect them to take steps to have the question determined, the question may be referred by him to an industrial tribunal and shall be dealt with as if the reference were of a claim by the women against the employer.

(3) Where it appears to the court in which any proceedings are pending that a claim or counter-claim in respect of the operation of an equal pay clause could more conveniently be disposed of separately by an industrial tribunal, the court may direct that the claim or counterclaim shall be struck out; and (without prejudice to the foregoing) where in proceedings before any court a question arises as to the operation of an equal pay clause, the court may on the application of any party to the proceedings or otherwise refer that question, or direct it to be referred by a party to the proceedings, to an industrial tribunal for determination by the tribunal, and may stay or sist the proceedings in the meantime.

(4) No claim in respect of the operation of an equal pay clause relating to a woman's employment shall be referred to an

Equal Pay Act 1970

c. 41

1369

industrial tribunal otherwise than by virtue of subsection (3) above, if she has not been employed in the employment within the six months preceding the date of the reference.

(5) A woman shall not be entitled, in proceedings brought in respect of a failure to comply with an equal pay clause (including proceedings before an industrial tribunal), to be awarded any payment by way of arrears of remuneration or damages in respect of a time earlier than two years before the date on which the proceedings were instituted.

(6) Where a woman ought to be or to have been given equal treatment with a man as required by her equal pay clause, and he enjoys or has enjoyed by comparison with her any greater remuneration or other advantage, then it shall be for the woman’s employer to show that this advantage is not the result of his terms and conditions of employment being in any respect more favourable than hers, but is genuinely due to a material difference (other than the difference of sex) between her case and his.

(7) In this section “ industrial tribunal ” means a tribunal established under section 12 of the Industrial Training Act 1964; 1964 c. 16. and there shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament

any additional amounts which by virtue of this section are so payable under section 12(3) of that Act, as amended by section 46(5) of the Redundancy Payments Act 1965. 1965 c. 62.

3.—(1) Where a collective agreement made before or after Collective the commencement of this Act contains any provision applying agreements specifically to men only or to women only, the agreement may aJld P^y be referred, by any party to it or by the Secretary of State,structures* to the Industrial Court constituted under Part I of the Industrial 1919 c. 69. Courts Act 1919 to declare what amendments need to be made in the agreement, in accordance with subsection (4) below, so as to remove that discrimination between men and women.

(2) Where on a reference under subsection (1) above the Industrial Court have declared the amendments needing to be made in a collective agreement in accordance with that subsection, then—

(a) in so far as the terms and conditions of a person's employment are dependent on that agreement, they shall be ascertained by reference to the agreement as so amended, and any contract regulating those terms and conditions shall have effect accordingly; and

(b) if the Industrial Court make or have made, under section 8 of the Terms and Conditions of Employment 1959 c. 26. Act 1959 or any other enactment, an award or determination requiring an employer to observe the collective agreement, the award or determination shall have

effect by reference to the agreement as so amended.

1370

c. 41

Equal Pay Act 1970

(3) On a reference under subsection (1) above the Industrial Court may direct that all or any of the amendments needing to be made in the collective agreement shall be treated as not becoming effective until a date after their decision, or as having been effective from a date before their decision but not before the reference to them, and may specify different dates for different purposes; and subsection (2) above and any such contract, award or determination as is there mentioned shall have or be deemed to have had effect accordingly.

(4) Subject to section 6 below, the amendments to be made in a collective agreement under this section shall be such as are needed—

(a) to extend to both men and women any provision apply-

ing specifically to men only or to women only; and

(b) to eliminate any resulting duplication in the provisions

of the agreement in such a way as not to make the terms and conditions agreed for men, or those agreed for women, less favourable in any respect than they would have been without the amendments;

but the amendments shall not extend the operation of the collective agreement to men or to women not previously falling within it, and where accordingly a provision applying specifically to men only or to women only continues to be required for a category of men or of women (there being no provision in the agreement for women or, as the case may be, for men of that category), then the provision shall be limited to men or women of that category but there shall be made to it such amendments, if any, as are needed to secure that the terms and conditions of the men or women of that category are not in any respect less favourable than those of all persons of the other sex to whom the agreement applies.

(5) For purposes of this section “ collective agreement ” means any agreement as to terms and conditions of employment, being an agreement between—

(a) parties who are or represent employers or organisations

of employers or associations of such organisations; and

(b) parties who are or represent organisations of employees

or associations of such organisations;

but includes also any award modifying or supplementing such an agreement.

(6) Subsections (1) to (4) above (except subsection (2 and subsection (3) in so far as it relates to subsection (2 shall have effect in relation to an employer’s pay structure as

Equal Pay Act 1970

c. 41

they have effect in relation to a collective agreement, with the adaptation that a reference to the Industrial Court may be made by the employer or by the Secretary of State; and for this purpose “ pay structure ” means any arrangements adopted by > an employer (with or without any associated employer) which fix common terms and conditions of employment for his employees or any class of his employees, and of which the provisions are generally known or open to be known by the employees concerned.

(7) In this section the expression “ employment ” and related expressions, and the reference to an associated employer, shall be construed in the same way as in section 1 above, and section 1(8) shall have effect in relation to this section as well as in relation to that section.

4.—(1) Where a wages regulation order made before or after Wages the commencement of this Act contains any provision applying r!£t?tion specifically to men only or to women only, the order may be 0 referred by the Secretary of State to the Industrial Court to declare what amendments need to be made in the order, in accordance with the like rules as apply under section 3(4) atxwe to the amendment under that section of a collective agreement, so as to remove that discrimination between men and women; and when the Court have declared the amendments needing to be so made, the Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument coming into operation not later than five months after the date of the Court's decision direct that (subject to any further wages regulation order) the order referred to the Court shall have effect subject to those amendments.

(2) A wages regulation order shall be referred to the Industrial Court under this section if the Secretary of State is requested so to refer it either—

(a) by a member or members of the wages council concerned

with the order who was or who were appointed as representing employers; or

(b) by a member or members of that wages council who

was or who were appointed as representing workers;

or if in any case it appears to the Secretary of State that the order may be amendable under this section.

(3) Where by virtue of section 12(1) of the Wages Councils 1959 c. 69. Act 1959 a contract between a worker and an employer is to

have effect with modifications specified in section 12(1), then (without prejudice to the general saving in section 11(7) of that Act for rights conferred by or under other Acts) the contract as so modified shall have effect subject to any further term implied by virtue of section 1 above.

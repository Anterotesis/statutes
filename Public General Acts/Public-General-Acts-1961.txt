SCHEDULES FIRST SCHEDULE THE WARSAW CONVENTION WITH THE AMENDMENTS MADE IN IT BY THE HAGUE PROTOCOL PART I THE ENGLISH TEXT CONVENTION for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to International Carriage by Air

CHAPTER 1 Scope—Definitions Article 1

(1) This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed 'by an air transport undertaking.

(2) For the purposes of this Convention, the expression international carriage means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, - the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even if that State is not a High Contracting Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single High Contracting Party -without an agreed stopping -place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention.

(3) Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State.

Article 2

(1) This Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1.

(2) This Convention shall not apply to carriage of mail and postal packages.

(c) a notice to the effect that, if the passenger’s journey involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers for death or personal injury and in respect of loss of or damage to baggage.

(2) The passenger ticket shall constitute prima facie evidence of the conclusion and conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of the passenger ticket does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, none the 'less, 'be subject to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if, with the consent of the carrier, the passenger embarks without a passenger ticket having been delivered, or if the ticket does not include the notice required by paragraph (1) (c) of this Article, the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22.

Section 2—Baggage Check Article 4

(1) In respect of the carriage of registered baggage, a baggage check shall be delivered, which, unless combined with or incorporated in a passenger ticket which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph (1), shall contain:

(a) an indication of the places of departure and destination;

(ft) if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place;

(c) a notice to the effect that, if the carriage involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers in respect of loss of or damage to baggage. 2

(2) The baggage check shall constitute prima facie evidence of the registration of the baggage and of the conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of the baggage check does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if t)he carrier takes charge of the baggage without a baggage check having been delivered or if the baggage check (unless combined with or incorporated in the passenger ticket which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph (1) (c)) does not include the notice required by paragraph (1) (c) of this Article, he shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22, paragraph (2).

(3) The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea or by river performed outside an aerodrome. If, however, such a carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or transshipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during fie carriage by air.

Article 19

The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo.

Article 20

Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and the passenger may agree to a higher limit of liability.

(2) — (a)In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of two hundred and fifty francs per kilogramme, unless the passenger or consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater than the passenger’s or consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination.

(b) In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered baggage or cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier’s liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned.

1961

Carriage by Air , 1961

Ch. 27

99

object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered 1st Sch. by the same baggage check or the same air waybill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability.

Article 23

(1) Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.

(2) Paragraph (1) of this Article shall not apply to provisions governing loss or damage resulting from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo carried.

(2) A floating charge created by a company shall not affect any property which ceases prior to the commencement of the winding up of the company to be comprised in, and remains outwith, the company’s property and undertaking, but shall on the commencement of the winding up of the company, subject to sections one hundred and six A and three hundred and twenty-two of the Act of 1948 (which relate among other things to the validity of floating charges), attach to the property then comprised in the company’s property and undertaking not being excepted property, but subject to the rights of any person who—

(c) holds over the property or any part of it another floating charge so ranking;

and, subject as aforesaid, the provisions of the Act of 1948 relating to winding up, except paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section three hundred and twenty-seven thereof, shall have effect as if the charge were a fixed security over the property to which it has attached in respect of the principal of the debt to which it relates and any interest due thereon:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the operation of subsection (5) of section three hundred and nineteen of the Act of 1948 (which provides among other things for the payment of certain debts in certain circumstances out of property comprised in or subject to a floating charge).

(3) In the last foregoing subsection "excepted property" in relation to a floating charge means such property, or property of such descriptions, as may be specified in the instrument creating the floating charge as being excepted from the charge.

Ranking of floating charges. 5.—(1) Where any property of a company being wound up is subject both to a floating charge and to a fixed security arising by operation of law, the fixed security shall have priority over the floating charge. (2) Where any such property is subject both to a floating charge and to a fixed security not falling under the foregoing subsection the fixed security shall have priority over the floating charge unless— (a) the contract or undertaking creating the fixed security was made or granted after the commencement of this Act, and (b) the floating charge was registered before the right of the creditor in the fixed security was constituted as a real right, and (c) the instrument creating the floating charge prohibited the company from subsequently creating any fixed security having priority over, or ranking equally with, the floating charge. (3) Where any such property is subject to two or more floating charges, those charges shall rank with one another according to the time of their registration: Provided that if, in the case of any two or more such charges, the instruments creating them each contain a provision that they shall rank with one another equally, they shall so rank. (4) For the purposes of this section the registration of any two or more floating charges which have been received by the registrar for registration by the same post delivery shall be deemed to be simultaneous and those charges shall accordingly rank with one another equally. (5) This section shall be without prejudice to subsection (5) of section three hundred and nineteen of the Act of 1948 (which relates to preferential payments).

Registration of charges. 6. For the purpose of securing the publication of floating charges created by companies and other charges so created which ought to be published for the information of persons considering taking security from such companies by way of floating charge, the Act of 1948 shall have effect subject to the amendment set out in the Second Schedule to this Act.

An Act to establish a Covent Garden Market Authority and vest in them lands in the parish of Saint Paul, Covent Garden, and chattels the property of Covent Garden Market Limited; to make provision for the conduct in, and adjacent to, Covent Garden, under the control of the Covent Garden Market Authority, of activities relating to the dealing in bulk in horticultural produce; and to make provision with respect to matters arising out of the matters aforesaid.

[27th July, 1961]

WHEREAS by Letters Patent bearing date at Westminster the twelfth day of May, sixteen hundred and seventy (in this Act referred to as " the Letters Patent "), His late Majesty King Charles the Second gave and granted to William Earl of Bedford the right to have, hold and keep, in a place in the parish of Saint Paul, Covent Garden, commonly called, and in this Act referred to as, " the Piazza ", a market for the buying and selling of all manner of fruit, flowers, roots, and herbs, whatsoever, together with all liberties and free customs, tolls.

1961

Covent Garden Market

Act, 1

Ch. 49

stallage, piccage, and all other profits, advantages, and emoluments whatsoever, to such market any way belonging, appertaining, arising, or coming, or with the same used, held, or enjoyed:

And whereas such market was held accordingly in the Piazza and, together with the ground on which it was held, became known by the name of Covent Garden Market:

And whereas with the effluxion of time there arose so great an increase of the quantity of articles brought to the said market for sale and of the number of persons resorting thereto as to necessitate the passing, in the fifty-third year of the reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, of an Act entitled "An Act for regulating Covent Garden Market ":

And whereas the said Act was, in the ninth year of the reign of His late Majesty King George the Fourth, repealed and replaced by another Act (in this Act referred to as " the Improvement Act ") entitled "An Act for the improvement and regulation of Covent Garden Market ":

And whereas, during a period of thirty years (more or less) beginning about the year eighteen hundred and sixty, Francis Duke of Bedford and his successors erected, upon land adjacent to the Piazza, buildings to which persons resorted to buy and sell fruit, flowers and other horticultural produce:

And whereas, as the result of divers transactions, the rights conferred by the Letters Patent and the Improvement Act together with the fee simple as well of the greater part of the land comprising the Piazza as of the land adjacent thereto the site of the said buildings, and of other land adjacent thereto, have become vested in a company named Covent Garden Market Limited (in this Act referred to as " the Company "):

And whereas it is expedient to make further provision for regulating the market business carried on on the lands aforesaid and in the neighbourhood thereof and, in connection therewith, for reducing the congestion of traffic and the risk of fire now occasioned by the ill-arranged state of those lands and the land in the neighbourhood thereof, and for that purpose to constitute a public authority and vest in them, for the interest therein of the Company, such of the lands aforesaid as are coloured pink on (the plans (in this Act referred to as " the deposited plans ") which, in connection with the Bill for this Act, have been deposited with the London County Council and the Council of the City of Westminster:

And whereas books of reference to the deposited plans, containing the names of the owners or reputed owners, lessees or reputed lessees, and occupiers of the lands coloured pink on those plans, have been deposited with those plans:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and

532 Ch. 49 Covent Garden Market 9 & 10 ELiz. 2 Act, 1961 Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

(4) Before appointing a person to be a member of the Authority, the Minister shall satisfy himself that that person will have no such financial or other interest as is likely to affect prejudicially the discharge by him of his functions as member of the Authority, and the Minister shall also satisfy himself from time to time with respect to every member of the Authority that he has no such interest; and a person who is, or whom the Minister proposes to appoint to be, a member of the Authority shall, whenever required by the Minister so to do, furnish to him such information as the Minister considers necessary for the performance by the Minister of his duties under this subsection. (5) The Authority— (a) shall pay to each member of the Authority other than the managing director, in respect of the member’s office as such, such remuneration (whether by way of salary or fees) and such allowances as the Minister may, with the approval of the Treasury, determine, and to the chairman in respect of his office as such, such remuneration and allowances (in addition to any remuneration and allowances to which he may be entitled in respect of his office as a member), and to the managing director such salary and allowances, as the Minister may, with the like approval, determine; and

(4) The total of any advances made by way of grant by virtue of subsection (3) of this section shall not exceed three and a quarter million pounds:

(8) If at any time the Minister is satisfied that no further sums will become payable by him by virtue of this section, all securities then forming part of the insurance fund shall be cancelled.

Ch. 61

771

(b) is subject to the condition that intoxicating liquor shall not be sold or supplied on the premises otherwise than to persons taking table meals there and for consumption by such a person as an ancillary to his meal.

(3) The second description of licence mentioned in subsection

(1) above (in this Act referred to as "a residential licence") is a licence which—

(a) is granted for premises bona fide used, or intended to

be used, for the purpose of habitually providing for reward board and lodging, including breakfast and one other at least of the customary main meals; and

(b) is subject to the condition that intoxicating liquor shall

not be sold or supplied on the premises otherwise than to persons residing there or their private friends bona fide entertained by them at their own expense, and for consumption by such a person or his private friend so entertained by him either on the premises or with a meal supplied at but to be consumed off the premises.

(5) The conditions as to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor set out in paragraph (b) of subsection (2) and paragraph

(b) of subsection (3) above, and any conditions in the same terms which may be attached to a justices’ licence,—

(a) shall not extend to the supply for consumption on the

9 & 10 Eliz. 2

Part I water) shall be equally available for consumption with or otherwise as an ancillary to meals served in the licensed premises.

(7) Where licensing justices grant or renew a restaurant: licence or a residential and restaurant licence, but as regards •the use of the premises for the provision of the customary main meals it appears to them that it is only for a mid-day meal or only for an evening meal that the premises fall within paragraph (a) of subsection (2) above, the justices shall attach to the licence a condition restricting the permitted hours in the premises so as to exclude any time after the afternoon break, or any time before it, as the case requires; but on the renewal of such a licence and at the request of the person applying for the renewal, or on an application by the holder, licensing justices shall revoke any such condition previously attached, if satisfied that it is no longer required by this subsection.

(8) Where licensing justices grant a new residential licence or residential and restaurant licence, they shall, unless it appears to them that in the particular circumstances of the case there is good reason not to do so, attach to the licence a condition that there shall be afforded in the premises, for persons provided with board and lodging for reward, adequate sitting accommodation in a room not used or to be used for sleeping accommodation, for the service of substantial refreshment or for the supply or consumption of intoxicating liquor; and where such a licence is granted without the condition required by this subsection, licensing justices shall, on the renewal of the licence, attach the condition if by reason of any change of circumstances it appears to them that the requirement ought no longer to be dispensed with.

(9) A justices* on-licence shall not be a restaurant licence, residential licence or residential and restaurant licence if it is subject to any condition not required to be attached to it in pursuance of this section or of section one hundred and nine (six-day licences) or one hundred and ten (early-closing licences) of the Licensing Act, 1953 :

(10) Notwithstanding subsection (10) of section six of the Licensing Act, 1953 (by virtue of which licensing justices have no power to attach conditions to the grant of a new justices’ on-licence for the sale of wine alone or sweets alone), this section shall apply to such a licence as it applies to a justices’ on-licence of any other class.

(11) Licensing justices shall not attach to the grant any new justices’ on-licence—

(a) any conditions calculated to restrict the sale or supply

1961

Licensing Act,

Ch. 61

773

of intoxicating liquor to a sale or supply in connection Part I with the service of meals, other than such condition as is required to be attached to the grant of a restaurant licence (modified, if need be, to allow for any sale or supply which it is desired to authorise in addition to a sale or supply in connection with the service of table meals); or

(b) any conditions calculated to restrict the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor to a sale or supply to persons residing in the licensed premises other than such condition as is required to be attached to the grant of a residential licence (modified, if need be, to allow for any sale or supply which it is desired to authorise in addition to a sale or supply to persons residing in the premises).

(12) No justices* licence other than a restaurant licence shall be granted for a restaurant carried on under the powers of the Civic Restaurants Act, 1947, and any justices’ licence granted for such a restaurant before this section comes into force shall have effect as a restaurant licence and may be renewed as such accordingly.

(13) Subsection (1) above shall not affect the operation of any enactment relating to the disqualification whether of persons or premises for holding or receiving a justices* licence, but save as aforesaid shall have effect notwithstanding any enactment restricting the grant of justices* licences, including in particular any enactment in Part II (war damaged areas) or Part III (new towns) of the Licensing Act, 1953.

2.—(1) Licensing justices may refuse an application for the Grant and grant or renewal of a restaurant licence, residential licence or renewal of residential and restaurant licence on any of the following grounds, that is to say,- ^est Z^,

(a) that the applicant is not of full age, or is in any other etc.

respect not a fit and proper person to hold one;

(b) that the premises do not fall within paragraph (a) of

subsection (2), (3) or (4), as the case may be, of section one of this Act, or are not suitable and convenient for ithe use contemplated by that paragraph, having regard to their character and condition, to the nature and extent of the proposed use and (where it applies) to the required condition as to sitting accommodation or as to the supply of intoxicating liquor only for consumption as an ancillary to a table meal;

(c) that within the twelve months preceding the

application—

(i) a justices’ on-licence for the premises has been forfeited; or

774

Ch. 61

Licensing , 1961

9 & 10 Eliz. 2

Part I

(ii) the premises have been ill-conducted while a justices* on-licence or a licence under the Refreshment Houses Act, 1860, was in force for them; or

(iii) the required condition as to sitting accommodation has been habitually broken while a residential licence or a residential and restaurant licence (or other licence with the like condition) was in force for the premises; or

(iv) the condition as to the availability of beverages other than intoxicating liquor has been habitually broken while a restaurant licence, a residential licence or a residential and restaurant licence (or other licence with the like condition) was in force for the premises.

(2) Licensing justices may also refuse an application for the grant or renewal of a restaurant licence or residential and restaurant licence on the ground that the trade done in the premises in providing refreshment to persons resorting there (but not provided with board and lodging) does not habitually consist to a substantial extent in providing table meals of a kind to which the consumption of intoxicating liquor might be ancillary.

(3) Licensing justices may also refuse an application for the grant or renewal of a restaurant licence, residential licence or residential and restaurant licence on the ground that the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor on the premises is undesirable—

(a) in the case either of a residential licence or a resi-

dential and restaurant licence, because a large proportion of the persons provided with board and lodging for reward is habitually made up of young persons unaccompanied; or

(b) in the case either of a restaurant licence or a residential

and restaurant licence, because a large proportion of the persons resorting to the premises but not provided with board and lodging is habitually made up of young persons unaccompanied; or

(c) in the case of any such licence, because the contemplated

provision of intoxicants would be by "self-service" methods, that is to say, any method allowing a customer to help himself on payment or before payment.

In this subsection "young person unaccompanied" means a person under the age of eighteen who is not accompanied and paid for by his parent or by a person of full age.

(4) If on an application for the grant or renewal for any premises of a restaurant licence, residential licence or residential and restaurant licence it is made to appear to the licensing

1961

Licensing , 1961

Ch. 61

justices on behalf of any such authority as is mentioned below in this subsection—

(a) that the authority or an officer designated in that behalf

by the authority desired in connection with the application to have the premises inspected for purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) above; and

(b) that after reasonable steps had been taken by or on behalf of the authority or officer for the purpose it was not possible to have the premises so inspected;

the licensing justices may refuse the application.

The authorities above referred to are—

(i) (according to the situation of the premises) the Common

Council of the City of London, or the council of the county borough, metropolitan borough or county district; and

(ii) the authority (if not included in paragraph (i) above) discharging in the area where the premises are situated the functions of fire authority under the Fire Services Act, 1947; and

(iii) the chief officer of police for the police area where the premises are situated.

(5) Where licensing justices refuse an application duly made for the grant of a new justices’ on-licence other than a restaurant licence, residential licence or residential and restaurant licence, they shall at the request of the applicant treat him as having also duly made an alternative application for a restaurant licence, residential licence or residential and restaurant licence for the sale of such descriptions of intoxicating liquor as he may specify in the request.

(6) On the renewal, transfer or removal of a justices’ on-licence licensing justices may, at the request of the applicant made with the consent of the registered owner (if any) of the licensed premises, vary the licence by attaching the conditions required for it to be granted as a restaurant licence, residential licence or residential and restaurant licence (in substitution for any conditions previously attached), and the renewal, transfer or removal of a justices’ on-licence with such a variation shall not be refused except on the grounds on which a renewal may be refused of a licence of the description specified in the request.

(7) Licensing justices refusing an application for the grant or renewal of a restaurant licence, residential licence or residential and restaurant licence shall specify in writing to the applicant the grounds of their refusal.

3.—(1) Where a person is convicted of an offence to which this section applies committed by him in respect of premises for which he held at the time of the offence a restaurant licence, residential licence or residential and restaurant licence, the court by or before which he is convicted shall have power to make a disqualification order under this section.

(2) A disqualification order may, at the discretion of the court, be either—

(a) an order disqualifying the person convicted, for such

period as may be specified in the order (but not exceeding five years from the date the order comes into force), from holding or obtaining licences of the relevant types; or

(b) an order prohibiting licences of the relevant types from

being held or granted within such period as aforesaid by or to any person in respect of the premises at which the offence in question was committed; or

(c) an order imposing both such a disqualification and such

a prohibition;

and, if such an order is made, any licence within the disqualification or prohibition, if previously obtained, shall be forfeited or, if subsequently obtained, shall be absolutely null and void.

(3) The court making a disqualification order may, on such conditions as it thinks just, suspend the operation of the order with a view to enabling a licence to remain in force pending an appeal against the conviction or against the making of the disqualification order, or pending the consideration of the question of bringing such an appeal; but, unless so suspended, a disqualification order shall come into force on the day it is made.

(4) A court shall not make a disqualification order containing a prohibition on the holding or grant of licences in respect of premises specified in the order, unless an opportunity has been given to any person interested in the premises and applying to be heard by the court to show cause why the order should not be made.

(5) At any time while a disqualification order is in force, a magistrates’ court, on complaint made by any person affected by the order, may revoke the order or vary it by reducing any period of disqualification or prohibition specified in the order; and any person who has made a complaint under this section and is aggrieved by the decision of the court on that complaint may appeal to quarter sessions.

of a prohibition imposed by the order on the holding or grant of licences in respect of any premises, any summons granted on the complaint shall be served on the chief officer of police for the police area in which the premises are.

(7) The powers conferred by section twenty-six of the Licensing Act, 1949 (as amended by section three of the Street Offences Act, 1959) to make disqualification orders on convictions of certain offences in connection with refreshment houses shall be powers to make an order having the like effect as a disqualification order under this section, and shall include the like power to suspend the operation of a disqualification order as is conferred by subsection (3) above; and so much of that section as provides for the forfeiture of a licence without a disqualification order, or makes forfeiture of a licence a condition for the making of a disqualification order, shall cease to have effect.

Accordingly the provisions set out in the First Schedule to this Act, being provisions which reproduce the effect of sections twenty-six and twenty-seven of the Licensing Act, 1949, and section three of the Street Offences Act, 1959, as amended by this subsection, shall have effect in place of those sections.

(8) Any disqualification order made before the commencement of this Act under section twenty-six of the Licensing Act,

1949, shall have effect in relation to restaurant licences, residential licences and residential and restaurant licences as it is expressed to have effect in relation to licences under the Refreshment Houses Act, 1860; and subsections (5) and (6) above shall apply to any such order in place of section twenty-seven of the Licensing Act, 1949.

(9) References in any enactment to a person disqualified for holding a justices* licence, or to premises disqualified for receiving a justices* licence, shall for the purposes of restaurant licences, residential licences and residential and restaurant licences apply, but for other purposes shall not apply, to persons or premises disqualified only by a disqualification order (including an order made under the First Schedule to this Act or under section twenty-six of the Licensing Act, 1949).

(10) This section shall apply—

(a) to offences under section one hundred and thirty-six of the Licensing Act, 1953 (permitting drunkenness on licensed premises, and sale of intoxicating liquor to drunken persons);

(b) to offences under sections one hundred and thirty-nine and one hundred and forty of that Act (permitting premises to be the resort of prostitutes, or to be a

Betting and Lotteries Act, 1934, and subsection (2) of section one of the Betting and Gaming Act, 1960 (using premises or permitting them to be used for betting transactions with persons resorting there);

(e) to offences under section ten of the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871 (harbouring thieves).

(11) The provisions of this section shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other provisions for disqualification or for forfeiture of licences; and the powers under this section may be exercised on a conviction in addition to any other powers which the court is required to or does exercise on the conviction.

4.—(1) No licence shall be granted by way of removal of a restaurant licence, residential licence, or residential and restaurant licence, and accordingly sections twenty-four to twenty-seven and Part VI of the Licensing Act, 1953, shall not apply to those licences.

(2) Where a restaurant licence, residential licence, or residential and restaurant licence is forfeited by a disqualification order made on the conviction of the holder of the licence by virtue of section three of or the First Schedule to this Act, justices of the peace shall have the like power to make a protection order under subsection (3) of section twenty-three of the Licensing Act, 1953, as they have in a case falling within that subsection, and the provisions relating to transfers of licences shall apply accordingly.

(3) Section one hundred and thirty-five of the Licensing Act, 1953 (which requires the holder of a justices* licence to display on the licensed premises a notice showing that he is licensed to sell intoxicating liquor and indicating the business for which he is licensed), shall not apply to the holder of a residential licence; and in the case of a restaurant licence or residential and restaurant licence the nature of the business shall be sufficiently indicated in the notice under that section, so far as relates to the restrictions imposed by the conditions as to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor, if the notice expresses that the holder of the licence is licensed to sell for consumption on the premises with meals.

(5) Consent shall not be granted under section one hundred and forty-eight of the Licensing Act, 1953, for an occasional licence to be granted to a person who holds the required excise licence in pursuance only of a restaurant licence, residential licence or residential and restaurant licence, unless—

6. —(1) In a county the county returning officer, and in a county borough divided into wards the mayor, may make arrangements for the votes to be counted not by electoral areas, but for the county or county borough as a whole or by such divisions of it as he thinks most convenient, and where arrangements are so made, the counting for the county or county borough as a whole or for each division of it, as the case may be, shall be carried out as it would be if that were the electoral area for which an election were being held:

Provided that where arrangements are so made in relation to a county borough the mayor shall act as returning officer in relation to the counting of the votes, but shall have the like powers in relation to the appointment of deputies as a county returning officer has.

(2) Where the votes are counted otherwise than for the county or county borough as a whole, then on the completion of the counting or any recount for an electoral area or other division the person acting as returning officer for the purpose (if he is not the county returning officer or mayor) shall forthwith notify the county returning officer or mayor of the number of votes counted on either side, but no other step shall be taken (except proper steps for the security of the ballot papers and other documents) unless or until it is ascertained that there is not to be a recount or further recount.

(2) There shall not be allowed to attend the counting of the votes at any place a greater number of observers under this paragraph than the number of clerks employed there in the counting, or any observer not duly notified of the time and place of counting; and

1961

Licensing , 1961

Ch. 61

825

the persons to be allowed to attend as observers in any case shall be designated by the county returning officer or mayor.

(3) Where on any poll a greater number of persons claim to attend the counting as observers Sian is allowed under sub-paragraph (2) above, the county returning officer or mayor in choosing between them shall have regard to their opinions about Sunday opening (if known to him) with the aim of designating, as far as he can, those for and those against Sunday opening in equal numbers.

(4) A local government elector may in like manner claim to attend the proceedings on the issue and receipt of postal ballot papers, as well as or instead of the counting of the votes, and the foregoing sub-paragraphs shall apply with the necessary modifications of the references to the counting or to a counting agent:

Provided that the number to be allowed to attend on any occasion shall be restricted to such number as the county returning officer or mayor may decide to be reasonable in the circumstances.

4.—(1) In respect of each approved dwelling provided by a local authority, not being a dwelling to which the last foregoing section applies, the Minister shall pay for each of the sixty years following the completion of the dwelling an annual exchequer subsidy of an amount determined as follows.

(2) The amount shall depend on whether for the relevant financial year—

(a) the amounts carried to the credit of the local authority’s Housing Revenue Account,

would be less than—

(b) the amounts debited to that Account,

(5) or sub-paragraph (6) of paragraph 1 of the Fifth Schedule to the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958, a sum equal to twice the gross value of the local authority’s houses.

(a) if for the relevant financial year there is a deficit as ascertained under this section, shall be twenty-four pounds together with the sum, if any, to be added under Part I of the First Schedule to this Act, and

(b) if there is no such deficit, shall be eight pounds.

(5) If for the relevant financial year there is no such deficit, but the sum under paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section does not, on the assumption there made, exceed the sum under paragraph (b) of that subsection by more than the difference between—

(a) the annual amount of the exchequer subsidies which,

if there had been such a deficit for the relevant financial year, would have been payable to the local authority under this section in respect of the dwelling and all other dwellings to which this section applies completed by the local authority in the same financial year (that is to say twenty-four pounds for each dwelling in question), and

(b) the annual amount which would be so payable but for this subsection (that is to say eight pounds for each dwelling in question),

the amount of the annual exchequer subsidy in respect of the dwelling shall be twenty-four pounds, and not eight pounds.

(6) Part II of the First Schedule to this Act (which defines the relevant financial year and gross value) shall apply for the purposes of this section.

(7) For the purposes of subsection (2) of this section any rent payable partly for houses within the Account and partly for premises not used for the purposes of a private dwelling shall be apportioned, and the part attributable to the houses shall be taken into account under that subsection.

5. —(1) If an approved dwelling is a flat in a block of fiats of four or more storeys, the amount of the annual exchequer subsidy payable under this Part of this Act shall be the amount payable under the foregoing sections of this Act plus—

(a) in the case of a flat in a block of flats of four storeys,

eight pounds,

(b) in the case of a flat in a block of flats of five storeys,

fourteen pounds,

(c) in the case of a flat in a block of flats of six or more

Subsections (1) and (2) of section eight of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958 (under which subsidies under that Act may be increased to meet expenses to secure protection against the consequences of a subsidence of the site or expenses attributable to special materials and methods of construction), shall apply in relation to annual exchequer subsidies payable under this Part of this Act as they apply to annual exchequer subsidies payable under the said Act of 1958, but as if—

(a) references in that section to authorised arrangements

made by a housing association included references to special arrangements made by a housing association with the Minister, and

(b) references in that section to section six of the said Act

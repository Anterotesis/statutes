of-
( a) an increase which has taken place in the level of prices,
costs or remuneration, or
( b) the coming into operation of a provision of an enact-
ment passed after this Act,
and that no account was taken of that increase or, as the case
may be, the effect of that provision when the amount available
for grants was so determined, he may for that year redetermine
that amount and the portions which are to be deducted there-
from in accordance with section 1(2) above and, by an order
made in the like manner and subject to the like provisions as a
rate support grant order, may increase the amounts fixed by
the relevant rate support grant order as the estimated aggregate
amount of the rate support grants and the aggregate amount of
the needs element for that year.
(2) The provisions of sections 1( 3) and 3( 3) above relating to
consultation and to a report of the considerations leading to a
determination under section 1 above shall apply to a
redetermination under this section as they apply to a determina-
tion under that section.
( 3) In redetermining under this section the amount available
for grants and the portions referred to in subsection ( 1) above,
the Secretary of State-
( a) shall take into account not only the effect of the increase
referred to in paragraph (a) of that subsection or, as the
case may be, the provision referred to in paragraph
( b) thereof, but also any future variation in the level
of prices, costs and remuneration current at the time
of the redetermination which in his opinion will result
from any such decisions as are referred to in section
1(3) (d ) above, and
( b) except in the case of a change resulting from the coming
into operation of any enactment passed after this Act,
shall take no account of any change, as compared
with the situation at the time that amount and those
portions were determined for the purposes of the rele-
vant rate support grant order, in the demand for ser-
vices giving rise to relevant expenditure, in the need
for developing those services, in the extent to which
those services have been developed or in the extent
to which, having regard to general economic conditions,
it is reasonable to develop those services.
( 4 ) An order made under subsection ( 1) above in respect of
any year shall specify the actual (and not the estimated) aggre-
gate amount of the resources element for that year.
Local Government Act 1974 131
c. 7
( 5) If, in a case where the Secretary of State proposes to make
PART I
an order under subsection ( 1) above in respect of any year, it
appears to him that, apart from any provision made by virtue of
this subsection, the effect of the order and of any other order
under subsection ( 1 ) above which he considers likely to be made
in respect of that year would be that the ratio between the actual
aggregate amount of the resources element for that year and the
aggregate amount of the needs element for that year would be
significantly different from the ratio (in this subsection referred
to as " the expected ratio ") between the estimated aggregate
amount of the resources element for that year, as fixed by the
relevant rate support grant order, and the aggregate amount of
the needs element, as so fixed, he may in the order under sub-
section ( 1) above-
(a) specify as the aggregate amount of the resources
element for that year such amount as, in his estimation,
will secure that (taking account of the effect of any
further orders likely to be made under subsection ( 1)
above in respect of that year) the ratio which the
amount so specified will bear to the aggregate amount
of the needs element for that year will be the expected
ratio ; and
( b) in order to secure that the total amount paid in respect
of the resources element to local authorities entitled to
payments in respect of that element does not exceed
the amount specified as mentioned in paragraph (a)
above, make provision for a corresponding variation
in the amount payable to each such authority in respect
of that element.
( 6) Except as provided by the preceding provisions of this
section, an order under subsection ( 1 ) above in respect of any
year shall not vary the amount of the elements of the rate
support grants for that year but, subject thereto, any such order
may, as respects the year to which it relates, vary any matters
prescribed by the relevant rate support grant order other than-
( a) the additional factors prescribed by that order for the
purposes of paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 to this Act ;
and
(b) any matter prescribed by that order in relation to the
domestic element or the resources element.
( 7) In this section " relevant expenditure " has the same
meaning as in section 1 above.

cause to be laid before Parliament a report stating the amount
of and the reasons for the proposed reduction and setting out
any representations made by the authority with respect to the
proposed reduction ; and if the report is approved by a
resolution of the Commons House of Parliament the Secretary
of State may reduce the elements of the grant accordingly.
( 2) The appropriate Minister may make regulations for pre-
scribing standards and general requirements in relation to any
function of a local authority ; and in determining for the
purposes of subsection ( 1) above whether there has been such
a failure as is mentioned in that subsection, regard shall be had
to any such regulations and any other standards or requirements
imposed by or under any enactment.

section 4, having effect for the purposes of that section
as if made under subsection (2) thereof,

which continues to exist by virtue of section 263( 5) of the Local
Government Act 1972.

in a council's estimated expenditure in connection with transport
matters their estimated capital expenditure in connection with
the provision by any person of facilities for or in connection with
the loading or unloading of freight carried or intended to be
carried otherwise than by road.
( 3) The aggregate amount of supplementary grants for
transport purposes for any year shall be such as may be
prescribed.
( 4) The proportion of the aggregate amount of supplementary
grants for transport purposes payable for any year to a county
council or the Greater London Council shall be determined, by
such method as may be prescribed for the purposes of this
section, by reference to the extent (if any) to which the accepted
estimated expenditure of the council for the year in connec-
tion with transport matters exceeds a level of expenditure
determined in such manner and by reference to such factors
as may be prescribed for the purposes of this section.
( 5 ) For the purposes of subsection (4 ) above, -
( a) the Secretary of State may treat the estimated expendi-
ture of the London borough councils and the Common
Council of the City of London in connection with
transport matters as forming part of the estimated
expenditure in connection with those matters of the

scheme by reference to their needs and their resources.
( 2) The statutory rate rebate scheme shall have effect in respect
of rebate periods beginning on or after 1st April 1974, and
accordingly no person shall be entitled in respect of any such
rebate period to a rate rebate under section 49 of the principal

(3) Without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred
by subsection ( 1) above, the statutory rate rebate scheme may
contain provisions corresponding, so far as the Secretary of

( model schemes of rent rebates and rent allowances).
( 4) In this Part of this Act " rebate period " means such
period as may be determined in accordance with the statutory
rate rebate scheme, and that scheme may make provision for the

of the scheme by reference to their needs and resources.
( 2) A local rate rebate scheme may take the form of a
scheme distinct from the statutory rate rebate scheme or may
operate by way of variation of that scheme, and accordingly any
reference in this Part of this Act to a local rate rebate scheme
includes a reference to the statutory rate rebate scheme as so
varied.
( 3) Alocal rate rebate scheme shall be so framed as to secure
that, in the estimate of the rating authority, —
(a) for any rebate period no person will be entitled under
the scheme to a rate rebate less than that to which he
c. 7
138 Local Government Act 1974
PART II would be entitled under the statutory rate rebate
scheme ; and
( b ) the total of the rebates which will be allowable under
the local rate rebate scheme in any year will not exceed
the permitted total of rebates for that year.
( 4 ) In relation to a local rate rebate scheme for any area,
the permitted total of rebates for any year is 110 per cent. of
the total of the rate rebates which ( if the local rate rebate scheme
had not been in force ) would have been allowable in that year
to residential occupiers in that area under the statutory rate
rebate scheme.

under the local rate rebate scheme, and
( b) the permitted total of rebates for that year and, if the
local rate rebate scheme was not in operation during
the whole of that year, the fraction of that permitted
total which corresponds to the fraction of the year
during which the local scheme was in operation.
( 7) Where it appears from a certificate under subsection (6 )
above that the amount specified as mentioned in paragraph ( a)
of that subsection exceeds the permitted total or, as the case
may be, the appropriate fraction of the permitted total referred
to in paragraph (b) of that subsection, it shall be the duty of the
rating authority to send to the Secretary of State, together with
that certificate , a statement of-
( a) their proposals for varying or revoking the local rate
rebate scheme so as to secure that the total of the rate

variation of a local rate rebate scheme will be required to secure
that result, notwithstanding the contrary view expressed by a
rating authority in a statement under subsection ( 7)(b) above,
or if it comes to the knowledge of the Secretary of State that
the condition in subsection (3)( a) above is not fulfilled with
respect to the entitlement of any person to a rate rebate under
a local rate rebate scheme, the Secretary of State may by order
provide-
(a) that from such date as may be specified in the order the
local rate rebate scheme shall have effect subject to such
variations as may be so specified and that, within such
minimum period as may be specified, no other varia-
tions may be made in the scheme by the rating autho-
rity ; or
( b ) that the local rate rebate scheme shall be revoked with
effect from such date as may be specified in the order
and that no new local rate rebate scheme shall be

of that Act for an increase in the gross value ascribed to the
hereditament in the valuation list by reason of the making of
structural alterations on or after 1st April 1974
( a) if and so far as the alterations are necessary for the
purpose of installing a system for providing heating
in two or more rooms in the hereditament, or
(b ) if the proposal would be for an increase not exceeding
such an amount as the Secretary of State may by order
specify,
and, accordingly, references in the following provisions of this
section to structural alterations do not include alterations falling
within paragraph (a) above.
( 2) If, by reason of the making of structural alterations on or
after 1st April 1974, a proposal is made for an increase in the

principal Act on the alteration of the valuation list
which, apart from this section, would be appropriate
to take account of the alterations, and
Local Government Act 1974 c. 7 149
( b) the alteration so agreed would represent an increase
in the gross value of such an amount that, by virtue
of subsection ( 1 )(b) above, no proposal for an increase
of that amount could have been made,
then, notwithstanding the said section 72(1 ), no alteration shall
be made to the gross value ascribed to the hereditament in the
valuation list.
( 3) If, by reason of the making of structural alterations on or
after 1st April 1974, a proposal is made for an increase in the
gross value of any such hereditament as is referred to in sub-
section ( 1 ) above but, on an appeal under section 76 or an
arbitration under section 78 of the principal Act relating to
the proposal, the court or arbitrator is of the opinion that the
increase in the gross value to take account of the alterations
would be of such an amount that, by virtue of subsection ( 1) (b)
above, no proposal for an increase of that amount could have
been made, the court or arbitrator shall direct that no alteration
be made to the gross value ascribed to the hereditament in the
valuation list.
( 4 ) If, by reason of the making of structural alterations on or
after 1st April 1974, the gross value of any such hereditament
as is referred to in subsection ( 1 ) above is increased but, on an
appeal under section 77 of the principal Act, the Lands Tribunal
is of the opinion that the increase in the gross value should be
reduced to such an amount that, by virtue of subsection ( 1 )(b)
above, no proposal for an increase of that amount could have
been made, the Tribunal shall give such directions as appear to it
to be appropriate to secure that the valuation list is altered so
as to restore to the hereditament the gross value ascribed to it
in that list before the increase.
( 5 ) In any case where,-
(a) by virtue of subsection ( 1 )( b) above, no proposal for
an increase in the gross value ascribed to a
hereditament in a valuation list is made to take account
of the making of structural alterations, but
( b) as a result of subsequent structural alterations, a pro-
posal, permitted by subsection ( 1) above, is made under
section 69 of the principal Act for such an increase,
then, for the purposes of section 79( 2) of the principal Act
( date on which alterations in the valuation list are to have
effect) , the event by reason of which the alteration is made
shall be taken to be the making of the last of the structural
alterations of which account was taken in the making of the
proposal referred to in paragraph (b) above.
( 6) An order under subsection ( 1)(b) above shall be of no effect
unless it is approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.

previously paid to the authority for the year concerned on account
of the resources element and the amount determined as mentioned

( a ) the aggregate amount of the additional payments
to be made for an accounting period of a
programme contractor in accordance with section
26 of this Act is likely to be deficient, and
( b) the deficiency would be wholly or mainly
attributable to excessive expenditure forming part
of the relevant expenditure by reference to which
those additional payments fall to be calculated,
the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, may
make an order prescribing the minimum amount of addi-
tional payments to be made by the programme contractor
for that accounting period.
( 2) In determining, for the purposes of the preceding
subsection, whether in the case of a programme contractor
any particular expenditure is excessive, the Authority or
the Secretary of State, as the case may be, shall have regard
to such considerations as they or he may consider relevant
in the circumstances, and in particular to—
(a) the scale (if any) on which any comparable expendi-
ture has formed part of the relevant expenditure
by reference to which the additional payments of
that programme contractor for any previous
accounting period have fallen to be calculated, and
( b) the scale (if any) on which any comparable expendi-
ture has formed or is expected to form part of
the relevant expenditure by reference to which the

additional payments of any other programme con-
tractor for any current accounting period of his
have fallen or are expected to fall to be calculated.
For the purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection an
accounting period of another programme contractor shall
be treated as current if the whole or part of it is comprised
in the accounting period referred to in subsection ( 1) of
this section.
( 3) Any order made under subsection ( 1 ) of this section
in respect of an accounting period may, by a further order
made by the Secretary of State after consultation with the
Authority, and with the consent of the Treasury-
( a) be revoked, or
( b) be varied by substituting a greater or lesser
amount for the amount specified in the order
( whether as originally made or as previously
varied under this subsection).
( 4 ) No order shall be made under this section after the
end of the accounting period to which it relates.
( 5 ) In making their contracts with programme con-
tractors for the provision of television programmes, it shall
be the duty of the Authority to require those contracts to
include such provisions as in the opinion of the Authority
will ensure that the Authority will be in a position to comply
with any order made under this section.
( 6 ) Any power to make an order under this section shall
be exercisable by statutory instrument ; and no such order
shall be made unless a draft of the order has been laid
before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each
House of Parliament.
( 7) An order made under this section shall, notwith-
standing that it makes different provision in relation to one
programme contractor from the provision made by any
order under this section in relation to any other programme
contractor, proceed in Parliament as if its provisions would,
apart from this section, require to be enacted by a public
Bill which cannot be committed to a Select or other Com-
mittee of either House under the Standing Orders of either
House relating to Private Bills.
(8) Nothing in this section shall have effect in relation to
contracts between the Authority and the programme con-

SCHEDULES
SCHEDULE 1
The following Schedule shall be inserted in the principal Act
after Schedule 2, and shall be numbered 2A-
" RENTAL PAYMENTS
Advertising receipts
1.- (1 ) In the principal sections and this Schedule " advertising
receipts " means, in relation to a programme contractor, and in
relation to any period, the payments received or to be received
by the programme contractor in consideration of the insertion
of advertisements in programmes provided by the programme
contractor and broadcast in the United Kingdom by the
Authority in the period.
( 2 ) If , in connection with the insertion of advertisements which
are paid for by payments constituting advertising receipts, any
payments are made to the programme contractor to meet any
additional payments, those payments shall be regarded as made
in consideration of the insertion of the advertisements in
question.
( 3) In the case of an advertisement inserted in a programme
under arrangements made between a programme contractor and
a person acting as advertising agent, the amount of any receipt
by the programme contractor which represents a payment by
the advertiser from which the advertising agent has deducted
any amount by way of commission shall be the amount of the
payment by the advertiser after the deduction of the commission,
so, however, that if the amount so deducted exceeds 15 per
cent. of the payment by the advertiser, the amount of the receipt
shall be the amount of that payment less 15 per cent.
( 4) Any contract shall provide that where for any insertion
of an advertisement a programme contractor receives or is
entitled to an entire consideration not solely referable to that
insertion, the advertising receipts shall be calculated by reference
to so much only of the consideration as is referable to that
insertion according to an apportionment made in such manner
as the contract may provide.
Profits
2.- (1) The profits of a programme contractor for an
accounting period shall be computed in accordance with this
paragraph.
( 2 ) The profits shall consist of the excess of relevant income
over relevant expenditure.
( 3) " Relevant income " means-
( a ) income which accrues to the contractor in connection
( directly or indirectly) with the provision of television
programmes by him, and
( b) where income accrues to a subsidiary of the contractor
in connection (directly or indirectly) with the provision
Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1974 c . 16 271
of television programmes by the contractor, such part
of that income as, in the opinion of the Authority,
should be attributed to the contractor as reflecting the
contractor's financial interest in the subsidiary.
( 4 ) Without prejudice to the generality of sub-paragraph ( 3)
above, " relevant income " includes all the contractor's
advertising receipts for the accounting period in question.
( 5) " Relevant expenditure " means-
( a ) expenditure properly chargeable to revenue account
which is incurred by the contractor in connection
( directly or indirectly ) with the provision of television
programmes by him, and
(b ) where a subsidiary of the contractor incurs expenditure
properly chargeable to revenue account in connection
( directly or indirectly ) with the provision of television
programmes by the contractor, such part of that ex-
penditure as, in the opinion of the Authority, should be
attributed to the contractor as reflecting the contractor's
financial interest in the subsidiary.
( 6 ) In ascertaining relevant income or relevant expenditure
no account shall be taken of-
( a ) interest on a loan, or
( b ) so much of any receipt or expenditure as in the opinion
of the Authority is attributable to the provision of
television programmes outside the United Kingdom.
( 7 ) Where relevant income consists of advertising receipts, the
income shall be attributed to accounting periods in accordance
with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Schedule, and the
same principle should be followed in relating other items of
income, and items of expenditure, to accounting periods.
Disputes
3. (1) For the purposes of the principal sections and this
Schedule-
( a ) the amount of any advertising receipts, or
( b ) the amount of any profits, or
( c ) the amount of any additional payments, or of an instal-
ment of additional payments,
shall, in the event of a disagreement between the Authority and
the programme contractor, be the amount determined by the
Authority.
( 2 ) No determination of the Authority under this paragraph
shall be called in question in any court of law, or be the subject
of any arbitration ; but nothing in this sub-paragraph shall
prevent-
( a ) the bringing of proceedings in the High Court, or the
High Court in Northern Ireland, for an order of
certiorari ; or
( b) the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court of Session to
entertain an application for the reduction or suspension
of the determination, or otherwise to consider the
validity of the determination.

SCH. 1 Accounting periods
4.- (1) Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, each period
for which a body corporate which is a programme contractor
makes up a profit and loss account which is laid before the
body corporate in general meeting shall be an accounting period,
whether that period is a year or not.
( 2 ) If part of the said period for which a profit and loss
account is made up falls before, and part after-
( a ) the commencement of the Independent Broadcasting
Authority Act 1974, or
( b) the commencement of an order under section 26 of this
Act ( made after the commencement of the said Act of
1974 ), or
( c ) the time when the programme contractor begins or
ceases to provide programmes for broadcasting by the
Authority,
the two parts shall be treated as separate accounting periods.
( 3) If sub-paragraph (2) above would produce an accounting
period of three months or less, that period shall be added on to
the accounting period (if any), which precedes or succeeds it (and
which does not fall to be divided from it under sub- paragraph
( 2 ) above ).
( 4 ) A contract which varies another contract may modify the
preceding provisions of this paragraph.
( 5 ) Nothing in this paragraph shall create an accounting
period which is a period during which the programme contractor
is not providing programmes for broadcasting by the Authority,
or an accounting period falling before the commencement of the
Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1974.
5. If the programme contractor is not a body corporate the
contractor's accounting periods shall be such as the Authority
may direct, or as may be provided in the contract.
Information
6.- (1) Every contract shall impose on the contractor such
requirements with respect to the furnishing of information to
the Authority as appear to the Authority, after consultation
with the Secretary of State, to be requisite-
( a ) for enabling the Authority to perform their functions
under the provisions of the principal sections and this
Schedule, and
(b ) for enabling the Authority to furnish to the Secretary of
State such information as he may require for the
purpose of determining whether, and in what manner,
to exercise his powers of making orders under the said
provisions.
Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1974 c . 16 273
( 2 ) It shall be the duty of the Authority to furnish to the
SCH. 1
Secretary of State such information ( whether obtained from
contractors or otherwise) as is in their possession and is required
by the Secretary of State for the purpose of determining whether,
and in what manner, to exercise his powers of making orders
under the said provisions.
7. It shall be the duty of the Authority in framing any
contract to include terms ensuring that the Authority will have
the right to inspect all accounts and records-
( a ) of the programme contractor, and
(b) of any subsidiary of the programme contractor,
for the purpose of discharging their functions under the
principal sections and this Schedule.
Interpretation
8.- (1) In this Schedule, and in the principal sections, except
where the context otherwise requires-
ود
" accounting period shall be construed in accordance
with paragraph 4 above,
" additional payments " has the meaning given by section
26 of this Act,
" contract " means a contract between the Authority and a
programme contractor under which television

contractor ,
" subsidiary ", in relation to any person, means a company

per cent. or more of the equity share capital.
( 2) In this Schedule " payment " includes any valuable con-
sideration, and references to receipts and expenditure shall be
construed accordingly. "
SCHEDULE 2
Section4.
TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
1. In this Schedule " the existing statutory provisions means the
provisions of the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973 (in this 1973 с. 19.
66
Schedule called the principal Act ") as in force immediately
before the commencement of this Act , " the new statutory provi-
sions " means the provisions of that Act as amended by this Act ,
and " the Authority means the Independent Broadcasting
Authority.
2.- (1) Subject to the following provisions of this Schedule, any
contract between the Authority and a programme contractor which is
in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall,
until it is varied or superseded by a further contract between them
or expires or is otherwise terminated, whichever first occurs, be
deemed to be modified by virtue of this Schedule so as-
( a ) to substitute provisions in conformity with the new statutory
provisions for so much of the contract as is in accordance
274 c . 16 Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1974
SCH. 2
with the existing statutory provisions and is not in con-
formity with the new statutory provisions, and
(b) to incorporate in the contract such additional provisions
as a contract between the Authority and a programme con-
tractor is required to include in accordance with the new
statutory provisions ;
and (subject to paragraph 3 of Schedule 2A to the principal Act as
amended by this Act) any provisions of the contract which provide
for arbitration as to any matters contained in the contract in
accordance with the existing statutory provisions shall be construed
( with the necessary modifications) as making the like provision for
arbitration in relation to matters deemed to be included in the
contract by virtue of the preceding provisions of this sub-paragraph.
( 2 ) Where it appears to the Authority that the new statutory
provisions call for the inclusion of additional terms in any such
contract, but do not afford sufficient particulars of what those terms
should be, the Authority may, after consulting the programme
contractor, decide what those terms are to be.
3. Nothing in the existing statutory provisions shall create an
accounting period falling after the commencement of this Act, and
if part of an accounting period under the existing statutory provisions
would fall before that time, and part after, the part before shall be
a separate accounting period.
4. For the purposes of section 27B of the principal Act, as amended
by this Act, account may be taken of any expenditure which is
referable to any period before the commencement of this Act.

an enlarged scale or of a new character, and it appears to the
registrar, having regard to the restrictions imposed by this
section on friendly societies registered later, that for the protec-
tion of the revenue it is expedient to do so, he may serve a
notice on the society referring to the provisions of this sub-
section and stating that he is considering the question whether,

takings, the registrar remains of the opinion that it is expedient
to do so, he shall direct that this section shall apply to the society
as from the date specified in the notice, but subject to any further
direction given by him cancelling that direction.

would apply to the disposal if the said company or, as the case
may be, a land-owning company mentioned in paragraph (b)
of that subsection had been a close company at the material
time (that is to say, immediately before the disposal) , then,
if the said company or that land-owning company was not
resident in the United Kingdom at that time but would have been
a close company at that time if it had been so resident, this
Chapter shall apply in relation to the disposal as if the said
company or, as the case may be, the land- owning company
had been resident in the United Kingdom at that time.
(5) Where a person disposes of shares in a company (" the
said company ") in a case falling within subsection ( 1) (a) above
and at the material time ( that is to say, immediately before the
disposal) the said company had control of a land-owning com-

was not a close company, then this Chapter shall apply in
relation to the disposal as if that land-owning company had been
resident in the United Kingdom at that time.

( 2) If it appears to the Board reasonable to do so, having regard
to all the circumstances of a particular case, they may direct that in
relation to that case sub-paragraph (1) above shall have effect as if
for the references to twelve months there were substituted references
to such longer period as meets the circumstances of that case.
(3) Where the land, caravan or house boat is used as the only or

thereby fall within sub-paragraph (1)(a) above unless it is provided
rent- free and without any other consideration.

under section 75 of that Act only to the extent that the amount on
which it is payable does not exceed the following limit, that is to
say, £25,000 for 1974-75 reduced by the amount on which interest is
payable under any loan taken into account under sub-paragraph (2)
below ; so that-
( a ) if the amount on which interest is payable under the
limited loan exceeds the limit, so much only of that interest
is eligible for the relief as bears to the whole of that
interest the same proportion as that part of that amount
which does not exceed the limit bears to the whole of
that amount ; and
(b ) if the amount on which interest is payable under loans
taken into account under sub-paragraph (2) below is £25,000
or more none of the interest on the limited loan is eligible
for the relief.

was made jointly to the borrower and another person, not being
the borrower's husband or wife, then, if-
( a ) the land, caravan or house boat concerned is used as the
main or only residence of that other person, or of a
dependent relative or former or separated spouse of his, and
( b ) that other person owns an estate or interest in the land or
the property in the caravan or house boat, and
( c ) that other person pays part of the interest payable on the
loan ,
the amount on which interest is payable under the loan shall be
treated for the purposes of this paragraph as being such part only
of that amount as bears to the whole thereof the same proportion
as the amount of interest paid by the borrower bears to the whole
of the interest paid on the loan.
( 4 ) For the purposes of this paragraph-
( a) any interest payable on a loan made to the borrower's
husband or wife shall be treated as payable on a loan
made to the borrower ; and
(b ) where interest is payable on more than one loan made
or treated as made to the borrower and the loans were

that the deceased would have survived and been the borrower ; and
if , at his death, the land, caravan or house boat concerned was used
as his only or main residence, it shall be further assumed that he

then apply, namely, that the land, caravan or house boat is, at the
time the interest is paid, used as the only or main residence of the
deceased's widow or widower or of any dependent relative of the
deceased.

SCHEDULE 3
PROVISIONS SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION 38
PART I
DEFINITIONS OF CURRENT USE VALUE, MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT, ETC.
Definition of current use value
1.- ( 1) For the purposes of the principal section and this Schedule
the current use value of an interest in land shall be ascertained in
accordance with this Part of this Schedule ; and in this Part of this
Schedule the time as at which current use value is to be ascertained
is referred to as the relevant time "."
( 2 ) Subject to the following provisions of this Part of this Schedule,
the current use value of an interest in land at the relevant time is
the market value of that interest at that time calculated on the
assumption that it was at that time, and would continue to be,
unlawful to carry out any material development of the land other
than any material development thereof which, being authorised by
planning permission in force at that time, was begun before that time.
( 3) In this paragraph " planning permission " has the same mean-
1971 с. 78.
ing as in the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, or, in Scotland,
1972 с. 52.
the Town and Country Planning ( Scotland ) Act 1972, or, in Northern
S.I. 1972/1634. Ireland, the Planning ( Northern Ireland ) Order 1972 ; and in deter-
mining for the purposes of this paragraph what material development
of any land was authorised by planning permission at a time when
there was in force in respect of the land planning permission granted
on an outline application ( that is to say, an application for planning
permission subject to subsequent approval on any matters), any such
development of the land which at that time-
( a ) was authorised by that permission without any requirement
as to subsequent approval ; or
( b ) not being so authorised, had been approved in the manner
applicable to that planning permission,
but no other material development, shall for those purposes be taken
to have been authorised by that permission at that time.
Current use value -part disposals
2.- (1) Subject to sub- paragraphs (5) to (7 ) below, this paragraph
shall apply as regards the current use value of an interest in land
which has been disposed of by way of a part disposal of an asset
( in this paragraph referred to as " the relevant asset " ) consisting of an
interest in land.
(2) The current use value at the relevant time of the interest
disposed of shall be the relevant fraction of the current use value of
the relevant asset at that time, calculated on the same assumptions
as to the lawfulness or otherwise of any material development as fall
to be made under this Schedule in calculating the current use value at
that time of the interest disposed of.
c .30
Finance Act 1974 483
( 3) For the purposes of the preceding sub- paragraph " the relevant
SCH. 3
fraction " means that fraction of the sums mentioned in the following
sub- paragraph which under paragraph 7( 2) of Schedule 6 to the
Finance Act 1965 is, or would but for paragraph 7( 4) of that Schedule 1965 c. 25.
be, allowable as a deduction in computing under that Schedule
the amount of the gain accruing on the part disposal.
( 4 ) The sums referred to in the preceding sub-paragraph are the
sums which, if the entire relevant asset had been disposed of at the
time of the part disposal, would be allowable by virtue of paragraph
4 ( 1) (a) and (b) of the said Schedule 6 as a deduction in computing
under that Schedule the gain accruing on that disposal of the relevant
asset.
(5 ) Sub-paragraphs ( 2 ) to ( 4) above shall not apply-
( a ) in the case of a disposal of an interest in land by way of
a part disposal if , on making the disposal, the person doing
so no longer has any interest in the land which is subject
to that interest ; or
( b) in a case to which the following provisions of this paragraph
apply.
( 6 ) In computing under this Chapter any gain accruing to a
person on a part disposal of a lease which is a wasting asset by way
of the grant of a sub-lease for a premium, the current use value of
the lease at the time of its acquisition by the person making the
disposal shall be the relevant fraction of what its current use value
at that time would be apart from sub-paragraphs (2) to ( 4) above.
( 7 ) For the purposes of the preceding sub-paragraph " the relevant
fraction " means that fraction of the expenditure attributable to the
lease under paragraph 4(1)( a ) and (b ) of Schedule 6 to the Finance
Act 1965 which under paragraph 4 of Schedule 8 to that Act
( sub-leases out of short leases ) falls to be apportioned to what is
disposed of.
3. In computing under this Chapter any gain accruing to a person
on a part disposal of an interest in land resulting under subsection
( 3) of section 22 of the Finance Act 1965 from the receipt as
mentioned in paragraph (a ), ( c) or (d ) of that subsection of a capital
sum, the current use value at the relevant time of the interest out of
which the part disposal was made shall be taken to be what it would
have been at that time if the circumstances which caused the capital
sum to be received had not arisen.
Current use value -leases and reversions
4.- (1) The current use value of an interest in land which is
either-
(a ) a freehold interest which is subject to a lease or an agree-
ment for a lease ; or
( b ) an interest under a lease or agreement for a lease,
shall be ascertained without regard to any premium required under
the lease or agreement for a lease or any sublease, or otherwise under
the terms subject to which the lease or sublease was or is to be
Q2
484 Finance Act 1974
c . 30
SCH. 3

granted, but with regard to all other rights under the lease or
prospective lease ( and, for the current use value of an interest under
a lease subject to a sublease, under the sublease ).
( 2) If under the preceding sub-paragraph an interest under a lease
or agreement for a lease would have a negative value, the current use
value of the interest shall be nil.
( 3) If a lease is granted out of any interest in land after 17th
December 1973, then , in computing under this Chapter any gain
accruing on any disposal of the reversion on the lease made while
the lease subsists, the current use value of the reversion at any time
after the grant of the lease shall not exceed what would have been
at that time the current use value of the interest in the land of the
person then owning the reversion if that interest had not been subject
to the lease.
( 4) In the application of this paragraph to Scotland, " freehold "
means the estate or interest of the proprietor of the dominium utile
or, in the case of property other than feudal property, of the owner,
and " reversion " means the interest of the landlord in property
subject to a lease.
5.- (1) In computing under this Chapter any gain accruing to a
person on a disposal of a lease which is a wasting asset, the current
use value of the lease at the time of its acquisition by the person
making the disposal shall be the relevant fraction of what its current
use value at that time would be apart from this paragraph.
( 2) For the purposes of the preceding sub-paragraph " the relevant
fraction " means the fraction of which the numerator is equal to so
much of the expenditure attributable to the lease under paragraph
4(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1965 as is not under
paragraph 1 of Schedule 8 to that Act excluded therefrom for the
purposes of the computation under the said Schedule 6 of the gain
accruing on the disposal, and the denominator is equal to the whole
of the expenditure which would be so attributable to the lease for
those purposes apart from the said paragraph 1.
Definition of material development
6. In this Schedule, subject to the following paragraph, " material
development " , in relation to any land, means the making of any
change in the state, nature or use of the land.

the cubic content of the original building is not exceeded
by more than one-tenth ;
( b ) the carrying out of works for the rebuilding, as often as
occasion may require, of any building which was in
existence at the relevant time, or of any building which
was in existence in the period of ten years immediately

c . 30
preceding the day on which that time falls but was destroyed
or demolished before the relevant time, so long as (in either
case ) the cubic content of the original building is not
exceeded by more than one-tenth ;
( c ) the use of any land for the purposes of agriculture or forestry,
the use for any of those purposes of any building occupied
together with land so used , and the carrying out on any
land so used of any building of other operations required
for the purposes of that use ;
( d ) the carrying out of operations on land for, or the use of
land for, the display of an advertisement, announcement
or direction of any kind ;
(e ) the carrying out of operations for, or the use of the land
for, car parking, provided that such use shall not exceed
three years ;
( f ) in the case of a building or other land which at the relevant
time was used for a purpose falling within any class speci-
fied in paragraph 8 below or which, being unoccupied at
that time, was last used for any such purpose, the use of
that building or land for any other purpose falling within
the same class ;
( g ) in the case of a building or other land which at the relevant
time was in the occupation of a person by whom it was
used as to part only for a particular purpose, the use for
that purpose of any additional part of the building or

part of the building used for that purpose at the relevant
time or, as the case may be, one-tenth of the area of the
land so used at that time ;
( h ) in the case of land which at the relevant time was being
temporarily used for a purpose other than the purpose for
which it was normally used , the resumption of the use of
the land for the last-mentioned purpose ;

time, the use of the land for the purpose for which it was
last used before that time.

or (b) above whether or not the cubic content of the original building has been exceeded by more than one-tenth, the cubic content of
the building after the carrying out of the works in question shall
be treated as reduced by the amount (if any) by which so much of
that cubic content as is attributable to one or more of the matters
mentioned in the following sub-paragraph exceeds so much of
the cubic content of the original building as was attributable to
one or more of the matters so mentioned.
( 3) The matters referred to in the preceding sub-paragraph are

Computation of development gain in respect of disposal of
interest in land reflecting expenditure on enhancement
12.- (1) This paragraph shall apply in relation to a disposal of
an interest in land to which the principal section applies if any
expenditure which is or, but for paragraph 1 of Schedule 8 to the
Finance Act 1965, would be allowable under paragraph 4( 1)(b) of 1965 с. 25.
Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1965 as a deduction from the con-
sideration for the disposal in computing the chargeable gain
accruing thereon has been incurred since the person making the
disposal acquired the interest, not being expenditure attributable to
material development of the land carried out as mentioned in
paragraph 11(1) of this Schedule (that is, carried out after 17th
December 1973 since the person making the disposal acquired
the interest ).
( 2) For the purpose of computing the amount given by subsection
( 3)(c) of the principal section the current use value of the interest
in land at the time of its acquisition by the person making the dis-
posal or, if the interest was acquired by him before 6th April 1965,
its current use value at that date shall be taken to be equal to the
sum of the amounts mentioned in the following sub-paragraph.
(3) The amounts referred to in the preceding sub-paragraph are
the following, that is to say-
( a ) the current use value of the interest at the time of its acquisi-
tion by the person making the disposal or on 6th April 1965,
as the case may be ; and
(b) so much of the expenditure mentioned in sub- paragraph (1)
above as is reflected in the current use value of the interest
at the time of the disposal.

SCH . 3 ( 4 ) Where material development of the land has been carried out
( whether on only one occasion or on two or more different occasions)
after 17th December 1973 since the person making the disposal
acquired the interest, sub-paragraphs ( 2) and (3) above shall not apply,
and paragraph 11 of this Schedule shall have effect subject to the
following provisions of this paragraph.
( 5 ) Where any expenditure mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) above
was incurred before the date on which the material development of
the land carried out after 17th December 1973 on the first or only
occasion was begun, then in calculating under paragraph 11 (4)(a) or
11(6 )(a) of this Schedule the amount mentioned in the said paragraph
11( 4 )( a), the current use value of the interest at the time of its acquisi-
tion by the person making the disposal or on 6th April 1965, as the
case may be, shall be increased by so much of the expenditure so
incurred as is reflected in the current use value of the interest imme-
diately before the date on which the material development carried
out on that occasion was begun.
( 6) Where any expenditure so mentioned was incurred on or after
the date on which the material development of the land so carried
out on the last or only occasion was begun, then in calculating under
paragraph 11(5)(b) or 11 (6)(c ) of this Schedule the expenditure attri-
butable to that material development which is allowable as mentioned
in the said paragraph 11( 5)(b) there shall be included in that expen-
diture so much of the expenditure incurred as is reflected in the
current use value of the interest at the time of the disposal.
( 7 ) Where any expenditure so mentioned was incurred on or after
the date on which the material development ( " the preceding develop-
ment ") so carried out on any but the last of two or more occasions
was begun but before the date on which the material development
( " the following development " ) carried out on the next of those
occasions was begun, then, in calculating under paragraph 11(6 )(b)
of this Schedule the expenditure attributable to the preceding develop-
ment which is allowable as mentioned in paragraph 11( 5)(b) of this
Schedule, there shall be included in that expenditure so much of the
expenditure so incurred as is reflected in the current use value of
the interest immediately before the date on which the following
development was begun.
Provisions supplementary to paragraphs 11 and 12
13.- (1) Where paragraph 11 of this Schedule would, apart from
this paragraph, apply in relation to a disposal of an interest in land
because of any material development of the land carried out after
17th December 1973 since the person making the disposal acquired
the interest, the said paragraph 11 shall not so apply if the amount by
which the current use value of the interest immediately after the date
on which that material development was begun, calculated on the
assumption that it was lawful for that development to be carried out,
exceeds the current use value of the interest immediately before that
date-
( a ) is not greater than one-tenth of the current use value of the
interest immediately before that date ; and
( b ) does not exceed £2,500.

carried out on two or more different occasions after 17th December
1973 since the person making the disposal acquired the interest, then
for the purposes of this paragraph there shall be calculated for each
of those occasions the amount by which the current use value of
the interest immediately after the date on which the material develop-
ment carried out on that occasion was begun, calculated on the
assumption that it was lawful for that development to be carried out ,
exceeds the current use value of the interest immediately before that
date, and the preceding sub-paragraph shall not apply in relation to
the disposal if the aggregate of the amounts so calculated exceeds
£ 2,500.
( 3) Where by virtue of the preceding provisions of this paragraph
paragraph 11 of this Schedule does not apply in relation to a disposal
of an interest in land even though material development of the land
has been carried out as aforesaid, the material development in ques-
tion shall be disregarded for the purposes of paragraph 12 of this
Schedule.
14.- (1) Subject to the following sub-paragraph, material develop-
ment shall for the purposes of paragraphs 11 to 13 of this Schedule
not be treated as carried out after a particular date if it was begun
on or before that date.
( 2) If, in the case of any land-
( a) material development thereof was begun on or before 17th
December 1973 but was not completed on or before that
date ; and
(b) the development was on that date to any extent not autho-
rised by planning permission then in force,
then, for the purposes of paragraphs 11 to 13 of this Schedule, so
much of the development carried out after that date as was not so
authorised on that date shall be treated as begun on the earliest date
after 17th December 1973 on which any specified operation com-
prised therein is begun, and shall accordingly be treated as material
development of the land carried out after 17th December 1973.
( 3) Sub-paragraph ( 3) of paragraph 1 of this Schedule shall apply
for the purposes of this paragraph as it applies for the purposes of
paragraph 1 ; and in this paragraph " specified operation " has the

of an interest in land to which the principal section applies, being
adisposal in relation to which paragraph 23 of Schedule 6 to the
Finance Act 1965 ( sales of land in United Kingdom reflecting 1965 c. 25.

virtue of sub-paragraph ( 4) of that paragraph computed without
regard to Part II of that Schedule (assets held on 6th April 1965).

this Chapter shall have effect in relation to that disposal as if in
subsection (3)(c) of the principal section and paragraphs 11 and 12
of this Schedule any reference to the current use value of the interest
at the time of its acquisition by the person making the disposal or,
if the interest was acquired by him before 6th April 1965, its current
use value at that date referred only to its current use value at the
time of its acquisition by him.
Computation of development gains in connection with
replacements of business assets
16.- (1 ) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Schedule 4
to this Act, the development gain, if any, accruing in respect of a
disposal of an interest in land to which the principal section applies
shall, if the disposal is one in relation to which section 33 of the
Finance Act 1965 (replacement of business assets) applies, be
computed as if any claim under the said section 33 as respects
the whole or a part of the consideration for the disposal had not
been made.
( 2) The preceding sub-paragraph shall not affect the subsequent
operation of paragraph 4 of Schedule 8 to this Act in relation to

the Finance Act 1965 or paragraph 18( 4) of this Schedule the
person making a disposal of an interest in land to which the principal
section applies would, apart from this paragraph, be treated for the
purposes of Part III of that Act as if the amount or value of the
consideration for the acquisition of that interest were reduced or
further reduced by some amount, the development gain, if any,
accruing in respect of the disposal shall be computed as if the
said subsection (1 )(b) or (2)( b) or the said paragraph 18( 4), as the
case may be, did not apply to that consideration.
Replacement of business assets
18.- (1) If the consideration which a person carrying on a trade
obtains for the disposal of, or of his interest in, assets ( in this
paragraph referred to as " the old assets ") used, and used only, for
the purposes of the trade throughout the period of ownership is
wholly or partly applied by him in acquiring other assets, or an
interest in other assets ( in this paragraph referred to as " the new
assets ") which on the acquisition are taken into use, and used only,
for the purposes of the trade, and-
(a ) the old assets and new assets are within the classes of
assets listed in subsection (6 ) of section 33 of the Finance
Act 1965 (replacement of business assets) and the old assets
consist of or include land in the United Kingdom ; and
( b) some or all of the new assets are qualifying assets ; and
( c ) development gains accrue to the person carrying on the
trade in respect of the disposal ; and
( d ) the amount of the consideration for the disposal applied as
aforesaid is greater than the difference between the whole
Finance Act 1974 493
c .30
of that consideration and the amount of of those develop-
SCH . 3
ment gains,
then , if the person carrying on the trade makes a claim as respects
those development gains, the provisions of sub- paragraphs ( 2) to (5 )
below shall apply.
( 2) There shall be ascertained the following amounts, that is to
say-
(a ) the amount by which so much of the consideration for the
disposal as has been applied as described in sub-paragraph
(1) above exceeds the difference mentioned in sub-paragraph
( 1)( d ) above ; and
( b ) the amount of the consideration for the disposal which has
been so applied in acquiring qualifying assets ;
and in the following provisions of this paragraph " the material
amount " means whichever of those amounts is the smaller ( or,
if they are equal, the amount which is equal to each of them ).
( 3) The income tax or corporation tax to which the person
carrying on the trade is chargeable for the chargeable period in
which the disposal was made shall be reduced by an amount equal
to whichever of the following amounts is the smallest, that is to
say-
( a ) 30 per cent. of what is, under sub-paragraph ( 5) below,
the appropriate amount ;
( b) 30 per cent. of the amount, if any, by which the develop-
ment gains accruing to him in that chargeable period
exceed the development losses, if any, accruing to him
in that period (so that if the amount under this head is
nil, no reduction will fall to be made under this sub-
paragraph ) ;
(c ) the total amount of the income tax for which he is liable
for that chargeable period or, in the case of a company,
the total amount of the corporation tax for which the
company is liable for that chargeable period after setting

distributions etc. received by U.K. company ).
For the purposes of paragraph (b) of this sub-paragraph a
man and his wife living with him shall be treated as one person
if the result of so treating them is to increase the amount given by
that paragraph.
( 4 ) Where a reduction falls to be made under the preceding
sub-paragraph, the person carrying on the trade shall be treated
for the purposes of Part III of the Finance Act 1965 as if the 1965 с. 25.
consideration for the acquisition of , or of the interest in, such of
the new assets as are qualifying assets were reduced ( or further
reduced ) by what is, under sub-paragraph ( 5 ) below, the appropriate
amount ; but this sub-paragraph shall not affect the treatment for

of the development gains accruing in respect of the disposal,
the appropriate amount is the full amount of the develop-
ment gains so accruing ;
( b) if the material amount is less than one-half of the develop-
ment gains so accruing, the appropriate amount is an
amount equal to twice the material amount.
( 6 ) The following provisions shall, with any necessary modifica-
tions, apply for the purposes of this paragraph as they apply for
the purposes of section 33 of the Finance Act 1965, namely-
( a ) subsections ( 3), ( 5 ) and (7 ) to (11) of that section ; and
( b ) paragraph 3 of Schedule 12 to the Finance Act 1968.
( 7 ) Without prejudice to the provisions of Part III of the Finance

which are, in relation to a claim under this paragraph,
qualifying assets and some or part of which are not,
the consideration shall be apportioned in such manner as is just

a trade, qualifying assets if they are within the following classes
of assets, that is to say the classes listed in section 33( 6) of the
Finance Act 1965, excluding assets within paragraph ( b) of head A
in class 1 other than land constituting the site of any asset within

in exchange for shares in or debentures of another company in
circumstances such that paragraph 6 of Schedule 7 to the Finance 1965 с. 25.
Act 1965 (company amalgamations) applies, then, if section 41( 1)
of this Act applies to the disposal by him to the issuing company of
the shares in or debentures of the other company, the amount of any
development gain accruing to him in respect of that disposal shall be
computed as if the said paragraph 6 did not apply in relation to the
exchange.
( 2) Where, in the case of a disposal of shares in or debentures of
a company made in the circumstances mentioned in the preceding

SCH. 3
1965 с. 25.
respect of that disposal falls by virtue of that sub-paragraph to be
computed as if the said paragraph 6 did not apply in relation to the
exchange, the provisions of paragraph 14 of Schedule 9 to this Act

paragraph ( 1) of the said paragraph 14, but as if in the said sub-
paragraph (1) for the reference to the total tax chargeable in respect

that total tax exceeds the tax which would have been chargeable
but for the sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph.
Private residences
21. Where subsection (3) of section 29 of the Finance Act 1965

a gain accruing to an individual on a disposal of an interest in
land to which the principal section applies, then-
( a ) there shall first be computed both the development gain
that would accrue to him in respect of the disposal if that
subsection did not so apply and the chargeable gain that
would accrue to him thereon if that were so ;
( b) the amount of the development gain accruing to him in
respect of the disposal shall be equal to the amount of the
development gain as computed under (a ) above reduced by
the fraction given by that subsection ; and
(c ) that subsection shall then be applied to so much of the gain
accruing on the disposal as is equal to the chargeable gain
as computed under (a) above.
Transfer of business on retirement

of a disposal within subsection (1) of the said section 34, being gains
which so accrue-
( a ) where subsection (1)(a) of that section applies, on the disposal
of chargeable business assets comprised in the disposal by
way of sale or gift ; or
(b) where subsection (1) (b) of that section applies, on the disposal

( 4 ) An amount up to, but not exceeding, the amount ascertained
under the preceding sub-paragraph shall be applied so as to give relief
to the individual as respects the disposal by reducing or extinguishing
one or both of the following amounts, that is to say-
( a ) the aggregate of the development gains accruing to the
individual in respect of the disposal, being gains which so
accrue as mentioned in sub-paragraph ( 2) ( a) or (b) above ;
and
( b ) the aggregate of the chargeable gains accruing to him on
the disposal, being gains which so accrue as mentioned in
the said sub-paragraph (2)(a) or (b),

is to the individual's best advantage.
( 5 ) Subsection ( 5 ) of the said section 34 shall apply for the
purpose of arriving at the aggregate mentioned in sub-paragraph
( 4 ) ( b ) above as it applies ( in cases where that section applies) for
the purpose of arriving at the aggregate under subsection ( 2) or ( 3)
of that section.
( 6 ) Any relief given under sub- paragraph ( 4 ) above as respects
the disposal shall, for the purposes of the said section 34 as regards
any other disposal within subsection (1) of that section , be taken

meaning as in the said section 34.
Insurance companies
23. Where, in the case of an insurance company carrying on life
assurance business, a profit arising from general annuity business
and attributable to a disposal of an interest in land to which
section 38 of this Act applies falls ( or would but for paragraph 7(2)
of Schedule 7 to this Act fall ) to be taken into account in the
computation under section 312 of the Taxes Act ( general annuity
business and pension business: separate charge on profits), the
development gain, if any, accruing to the company in respect of the
disposal shall be computed as if paragraph 2( 1) of Schedule 6 to

of sums taken into account in computing income) did not apply.
Chargeable gains in respect of mineral royalties

Schedule as to the computation of the amount given by subsection
( 3)( c ) of the principal section, this paragraph shall apply in relation
to a disposal of an interest in land to which the principal section
applies if at the time of the disposal there is in force, as regards
the land or any part of it, planning permission authorising material
development consisting of the winning and working of minerals.
( 2 ) For the purpose of computing the amount given by sub-
section (3)(c ) of the principal section, the amount of the chargeable
gain accruing on the disposal shall be taken to be what it would
be if the amount which, in the computation of that chargeable gain,
falls to be taken as the consideration were reduced to the sum
of the following amounts, that is to say-
( a ) the market value of the interest at the time of the disposal
calculated on the assumption that it was at that time,
and would continue to be, unlawful to carry out any
material development of the land consisting of the winning
and working of minerals ; and
(b ) one- half of the amount by which the actual consideration
for the disposal exceeds the said market value.
In this sub-paragraph " the actual consideration for the disposal "

paragraph ) of the chargeable gain accruing on the disposal, falls
to be taken as the consideration.
( 3) Sub-paragraph ( 3) of paragraph 1 of this Schedule shall apply
for the purposes of this paragraph as it applies for the purposes

or minerals includes the carrying out of any ancillary operations
requisite therefor.

then the amount of any development gain accruing to him in respect
of the disposal (as computed before this sub-paragraph is applied)
shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which so much of the
consideration for the disposal as has been applied in acquiring before
that date, or under such a contract, all or any of the new assets
exceeds the sum of the amounts mentioned in the following sub-

( 2 ) Subsection (1) of the principal section shall not apply to a
relevant person's interest in the relevant land on the material date
unless on that date-
( a ) the relevant land is wholly or partly let under one or more
leases granted by him ; and
( b ) the rent or aggregate of the rents to which he is entitled
under the lease or leases is £ 5,000 or more per annum,
and shall in any case not apply to his interest in so much, if any,
of the relevant land as is occupied by him on that date.
For the purposes of this and the following sub-paragraph a relevant
person who on any date occupies not less than 90 per cent. of the
floor area of the relevant chargeable building shall be deemed to
occupy on that date the whole of so much of the relevant land as is
then subject to his interest ( and references to occupation in this and
the following sub- paragraph shall be construed accordingly ).
( 3) Where by virtue of sub-paragraph ( 2) above subsection (1) of
the principal section does not apply-
( a ) to a relevant person's interest in the relevant land on the
material date by reason of his occupation of so much of that
land as is subject to that interest ; or
(b) to a relevant person's interest in that land on that date so far
as it is not occupied by him,
then, if within the five- year period the rent or aggregate of the rents
to which he is entitled under any lease or leases by which he has let
the whole or any part or parts of the relevant land becomes £5,000
or more per annum, he shall be deemed for the purposes of Part III
of the Finance Act 1965 and Chapter I of this Part of this Act to
have on the subsequent date disposed of and immediately re-acquired
for a consideration equal to its market value his interest in so much
of the relevant land as is not on the subsequent date occupied by him.
In this and the following sub-paragraph " the subsequent date "
means the date within the five-year period on which the said rent or
the aggregate of the said rents first becomes £5,000 or more per
annum or, if this sub-paragraph would to any extent apply to a
relevant person's interest on the last-mentioned date but for his
occupation on that date of not less than 90 per cent . of the floor area
of the relevant chargeable building, the date (if any) within the
five- year period on which he first occupies less than 90 per cent. of
that floor area.
( 4 ) If before the end of the five- year period a relevant person-
( a ) in a case where subsection (1 ) of the principal section applies
to his interest on the material date in so much of the
relevant land as was not occupied by him on that date,
ceases to occupy any part of the relevant land which was
occupied by him on that date ; or
( b) in a case where sub-paragraph ( 3) above applies to his
interest on the subsequent date in so much of the relevant
land as was not occupied by him on that date, ceases to
occupy any part of the relevant land which was occupied
by him on that date,
Finance Act 1974 513
c. 30
then the said subsection ( 1) or sub-paragraph ( 3) shall apply to his
interest in that part as if he had not been in occupation of it on the
material date or the subsequent date, as the case may be ( but
without prejudice to the operation of this sub- paragraph in relation
to his interest in any other such part of the relevant land which he
may cease to occupy within the five-year period).
( 5 ) For the purposes of this paragraph the rent per annum to
which a relevant person is entitled at any particular date under
a lease of the whole or part of the relevant land shall be treated
as being whichever of the following is the greater, that is to say-

Interests other than that of a relevant person
3.(1) Subject to the following paragraphs of this Schedule, this
paragraph ( so far as applicable ) shall in the case of a relevant
chargeable building have effect with respect to any interest (other
than the interest of a relevant person ) which a person has in the
relevant land on the material date, being a freehold interest or an
interest under a lease or agreement for a lease.
( 2 ) Subsection (1 ) of the principal section shall not apply to a
person's freehold interest in the whole or part of the relevant land or
to the interest of a lessee under a lease of the whole or part of the
relevant land if at the material date-
(a ) that interest is not subject to any lease or agreement for a
lease, and the rack-rent for so much of the relevant land as
is subject to that interest is less than £ 5,000 per annum
and cannot reasonably be expected to be increased to or
above £5,000 per annum within the five- year period ; or
( b ) that interest is subject to one or more leases or agreements
for a lease extending, or together extending, to the whole of
so much of the relevant land as is subject to that interest, and
the rent or aggregate of the rents to which he is or is to be
entitled under or by virtue of the said one or more leases
or agreements is less than £5,000 per annum and cannot
reasonably be expected to be increased to or above £5,000
per annum within the five-year period ; or
(c ) that interest is subject to one or more leases or agreements
for a lease extending, or together extending, to part only
of so much of the relevant land as is subject to that interest ,

is to be entitled under or by virtue of the said one or more
leases or agreements ; and

relevant land as is subject to that interest,

of a person under an agreement to grant him a lease of the whole or
part of the relevant land as it applies in relation to the interest of a
lessee under a lease of the whole or part of the relevant land, subject
to the modification that in paragraphs ( a) to (c) the references to his
interest under that agreement being subject to one or more leases
shall be omitted.
( 4 ) Where a person's interest in the relevant land falls within
sub-paragraph (1) above and is not excluded from the operation of
subsection (1) of the principal section by any of the preceding pro-
visions of this paragraph, the said subsection (1) shall not apply to
that interest if the rent or aggregate of the rents to which he is or
is to be entitled under or by virtue of any one or more leases or
agreements for a lease to which at the material date that interest is
subject does not, and cannot be made to, reflect the value or any part
ofthe value of the relevant development.
( 5 ) Where-
( a ) the preceding sub-paragraph would apply to a person's
interest in the relevant land but for the fact that the rent or
aggregate of the rents there mentioned can be made to reflect
the value or part of the value of the relevant development ;
but
( b ) that rent or the aggregate of those rents cannot be made to
reflect that value (or part of it ) until a date as from which
the rent or one or more of the rents in question could be
increased under provisions for the review of the rent con-
tained in any relevant lease or agreement,
then, if that person makes a claim under this sub-paragraph, sub-
section (1) of the principal section shall in the case of that interest
or, if the rent or rents which can be increased as mentioned in para-
graph ( b) above extend to part only of a person's interest, that part of
his interest apply as if the last reference therein to the material date
were a reference to the date mentioned in paragraph (b) of this sub-
paragraph and, where the rent or rents which can be increased at
that date extend to part only of a person's interest, as if his interest
in the relevant land were limited to that part.
4 .- (1) In the case of a relevant chargeable building, paragraph 3
of this Schedule shall not have effect with respect to an interest which
a person has in the relevant land on the material date, being either-
( a ) a freehold or leasehold interest which on the material date
is subject to a lease or an agreement to grant a lease, being
( in either case ) a lease of which the term will expire within
the period of twenty-five years from the commencement of
the relevant development ; or
( b) an interest under an agreement for a lease which on the
material date is subject to an agreement to grant a lease
of which the term will expire within the said period.

to which the lessor or party agreeing to grant a lease is or is to be
entitled shall be deemed to be what it would be if , the other terms
of the lease or agreement remaining as they are, the amount of the
rent had been negotiated by the parties at arm's length.

sum(whether in lieu of or in addition to rent) -

634 c. 35
Carriage ofPassengers by Road Act 1974
the carriage and occurring while the passenger is inside the vehicle
or is entering or alighting from the vehicle, or occurring in connection
with the loading or unloading of luggage.
2. The carrier shall be relieved of this liability if the accident was
caused by circumstances which a carrier, using the diligence which
the particular facts of the case called for , could not have avoided
and the consequences of which he was unable to prevent.
3. The carrier shall not be relieved of liability by reason of any
physical or mental failing of the driver, of any defect in, or
malfunctioning of , the vehicle, or of any wrongful act or neglect
on the part of the person from whom he may have hired the vehicle
or of the persons for whom the latter would have been responsible,
in accordance with the provisions of article 4, if he had himself
been the carrier.
Article 12
Subject to article 13, paragraph 1, the court or tribunal seized of
the case shall determine in accordance with the national law of the
place where the said court or tribunal is situated, including the rules
relating to conflict of laws, the extent of the injury giving rise to
compensation as a result of the death or wounding of or any other
bodily or mental injury caused to a passenger as well as what persons
are entitled to compensation for such injury.
Article 13
1. The total damages payable by the carrier in respect of the
same occurrence shall not exceed 250,000 francs for each victim.
Any Contracting State may, however, set a higher limit or set no
limit at all. When the carrier has his principal establishment in
such a State, or in a non-contracting State whose legislation provides
for a higher limit or does not provide for a limit at all, the law
of that State, not including the rules relating to conflict of laws,
shall apply for the determination of the total amount.
2. The amount referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall be

contract of carriage. Unless the contract provides otherwise, such
agreement shall be for the benefit of all persons entitled to
compensation.

apply to all the claims arising out of the death or wounding of,
or any other bodily or mental injury to, a passenger. Where there
is more than one claimant and the total of their claims exceeds
the limit established, the claims shall be reduced proportionately.

delivery or of its deposit in accordance with article 10, paragraph 3.
The carrier shall be responsible for other luggage while it is in
the vehicle but if , in circumstances other than of an accident, the
luggage is stolen or cannot be found, the carrier shall be responsible
only if it had been placed in his care. Such other luggage shall
be deemed to include personal effects carried or worn by the
passenger.
2. The carrier shall be relieved of this liability if the loss or
damage results from an inherent defect in the luggage, from a special
risk inherent in its perishable or dangerous nature or from circum-
stances which a carrier using the diligence which the particular
facts of the case called for could not have avoided and the
consequences of which he was unable to prevent.
3. The carrier shall not be relieved of liability by reason of any
physical or mental failing of the driver, of any defect in or
malfunctioning of the vehicle, or of any wrongful act or neglect on

it, the carrier shall take all reasonable steps to notify the passenger.
Within the thirty days following receipt of such notification the
passenger may, against refund of any compensation which may have
been paid in respect of the loss but without prejudice to any claims
to compensation for delay, have the piece of luggage delivered to
him either at the place of departure or at the place appointed for
delivery.
Article 16
1. When under the provisions of this Convention a carrier is
liable for compensation in respect of total or partial loss of, or in
respect of damage to, luggage, such compensation shall be claimable
in an amount equal to the amount of the loss or damage, but it
shall not exceed 500 francs for each piece of luggage nor 2,000 francs
for each passenger. Compensation may also be claimed in respect
of total or partial loss of, or in respect of damage to, personal effects
636 c. 35
Carriage ofPassengers by Road Act 1974
carried or worn by the passenger, but it shall not exceed 1,000 francs
for each passenger.
2. The amounts referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall
be exclusive of legal or other costs incurred by the parties in
asserting their rights, payment or reimbursement of which may
devolve on the carrier, and of interest calculated in conformity with
the law judged applicable by the court seized of the case.
3. Higher limits may be agreed between the parties to the contract
of carriage.
Section 3. General Provisions
Article 17

liability under this Convention to the extent that loss or damage
results from the wrongful act or neglect of the passenger or from
conduct by the passenger not conforming to the normal conduct
of a passenger.

damage.
Article 18

liability on any grounds whatever may not be instituted against the
carrier or against persons for whom he is responsible under article 4

article applies an action is pending before a court or tribunal
competent under this paragraph or where in respect of such a
claim judgment has been entered by such a court or tribunal, no
new action shall be started on the same grounds between the same
parties unless the judgment of the court or tribunal before which
the first action was brought is not enforceable in the country in
which the fresh proceedings are brought.
3. Where a judgment entered by a court or tribunal of a

the date on which the carrier rejects the claim by notification in
writing and returns any documents handed to him in support of
the claim. If a part of the claim is admitted , the period of limitation
shall start to run again only in respect of that part of the claim
which is still in dispute. The burden of proof of the receipt of
the claim or of the reply and of the return of the documents shall
rest with the party relying upon those facts. Further claims having
the same object shall not suspend the running of the period of
limitation unless the carrier agrees to consider them.
4. Subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the
extension of the period of limitation shall be governed by the pro-
visions of the law of the court or tribunal seized of the case not
including the rules relating to conflict of laws. That law shall also

of the work fix a period on the expiration of which the work
must be removed and, if they think fit, impose any conditions

been, so deposited, might have been imposed under subsection
( 3) above in passing the plans and, where they fix such a
period, shall forthwith give notice thereof, and of any condi-
tions imposed, to the owner of the relevant building.
(6 ) A local authority may from time to time extend any
period fixed, or vary any conditions imposed, under this section,

by the owner of the relevant building, they shall not exercise
their power of varying conditions so imposed except when
granting an extension or further extension of the period fixed

fine not exceeding £50 for each day on which the offence con-
tinues or, as the case may be, on which the work or building
is allowed to remain, after he is convicted ; but this subsection
shall not be construed as prejudicing a local authority's rights
under subsection (8) above.
(10 ) In this section " the relevant building " means, in any
particular case, the building mentioned in paragraph (a) or, as
the case may be, paragraph (b) of subsection ( 1) above.
(11 ) Section 53 of the 1936 Act (which is superseded by the
preceding provisions of this section) shall cease to have effect,
but-
( a ) any building regulations made, period fixed, condition
imposed or other thing done by virtue of that section
shall be deemed to have been made, fixed, imposed
or done by virtue of this section ; and
( b) anything begun under that section may be continued
under this Act as if begun under this section, so how-

payments
from land.
Charters of
novodamus,
etc.
which contains a grant of land in feu shall have effect otherwise
as if the grant were subject to a feuduty.
(2) A provision in a deed executed after such commencement
which purports to impose feuduty shall not render the deed
void or unenforceable, but the deed, if it contains a grant of
land in feu, shall be subject to the provisions of subsection ( 1 )
above.
2.- (1) No deed executed after the commencement of this
Act shall impose ground annual, skat or any other periodical
payment (other than feuduty) in respect of the tenure or use
of land or under a land obligation, not being a payment in
respect of a lease, liferent or other right of occupancy, a payment
of teind, stipend or standard charge, a payment in defrayal of
or contribution towards some continuing cost related to the
land, or a payment under a heritable security.
(2) A provision in a deed executed after such commencement
which purports to impose any payment to which subsection ( 1 )
above applies shall not render the deed void or unenforceable,
but the deed shall have effect only to the extent (if any) that it
would have had effect under the law in force before such
commencement if it had not imposed any such payment.
3. ( 1) The feuduty under a charter of novodamus or other
deed having equivalent effect executed after the commencement
of this Act may be of any amount which does not have the
effect of increasing the total amount of feuduty exigible in
respect of any land ; and any provision in any such deed which
produces that effect shall to that extent be void and unenforce-
able : Provided that , where any provisions relating to two or
more feuduties, contained in such a deed or in two or more
such deeds executed on the same day, have the effect cumula-
tively of increasing the total amount of feuduty exigible in
respect of any land, they shall, to the extent that they have the
effect of altering the amount or incidence of that feuduty, be void
and unenforceable.
( 2) This section shall apply, subject to any necessary modifica-
tions, to payments to which section 2 of this Act applies, as it
applies to feuduties.

this section shall, not later than the term of redemption,
(a) give to the superior or his agent a notice of redemption
in or as nearly as may be in the form contained in
Form 1 of Schedule 1 to this Act, and
(b) pay to or for behoof of the superior such a sum of
money as would, if invested in 24 per cent. Consoli-
dated Stock at the middle market price at the close of
business last preceding the date occurring one month
before the said term, produce an annual sum equal to
the feuduty ( hereinafter in this section referred to as
66 the redemption money "), and also any amount of
feuduty unpaid in respect of the feu, liability for which
has accrued up to and including that term, and any
interest or other payment exigible in respect of the
feuduty last mentioned.
(3) After due notice and payment in accordance with the fore-
going provisions of this section, the feuduty shall, at the said
term, be redeemed, and no payment shall be exigible in respect

superior or his agent shall, at the expense of the superior, grant
a receipt in or as nearly as may be in the form contained in
Form 2 of Schedule 1 to this Act.

arising after such redemption from such rights.
(6 ) Where the interest of the superior in a feuduty which is
redeemed in terms of this section is subject to any trust, liferent
or entail, the redemption money shall be treated for all purposes
as capital money.

cumulo feuduty which is unallocated and any part of a cumulo
feuduty which has been allocated, and includes any payment
( whether unallocated or allocated as aforesaid) of ground annual,
skat or any other perpetual periodical payment in respect of the
tenure, occupancy or use of land or under a land obligation, not
being a payment of teind, stipend or standard charge, or in
defrayal of or contribution towards some continuing cost related

in its application to any payment to which it is extended under
this subsection, shall have effect subject to any necessary modi-
fications.
5.-( 1 ) Subject to any agreement made before the commence-
ment of this Act in relation to the redemption of the feuduty
exigible in respect of a feu and to subsection (2) below, on the
date when entry is taken under an obligation to grant a convey-
ance of the feu for valuable consideration or under the deed
containing such a conveyance (the said date being hereinafter
in this section, subject to subsection ( 2) below, referred to as "
the
date of redemption "), the feuduty exigible as at the date of
redemption shall be deemed to have been redeemed : Provided
that this section shall not apply in any case where the date of
the obligation to grant a conveyance or of the execution of the
deed occurred before the commencement of this Act.
( 2 ) Where the date (whether before or after the commence-
ment of this Act) when entry is taken, as specified in subsection
( 1) above, is earlier than the date of the obligation there specified
or (where there was no such obligation) the execution of the
deed there specified, the date of redemption shall be the date of
the said obligation or execution as the case may be.
( 3) No payment shall be exigible in respect of a feuduty for
any period after the date of redemption thereof ; but the feu
shall continue in force otherwise as if the feuduty were not
redeemed.
( 4) On the date of redemption, there shall be payable to the
superior by the person who was the proprietor of the feu imme-
diately before the date of the obligation specified in subsection
( 1) above or (where there was no such obligation ) the execution
of the deed there specified, or by his representatives, such a sum
"
of money ( hereinafter in this section referred to as the
redemption money ") as would, if invested in 2½ per cent. Con-
solidated Stock at the middle market price at the close of busi-
ness last preceding the date occurring one month before the
date of redemption, produce an annual sum equal to the feuduty.
( 5) Subject to the provisions of subsections (6) to (8) below,
at and after the date of redemption, the redemption money, if it
has not been paid to the superior, shall, together with interest
thereon from the date of redemption until payment at such rate
or rates as may be determined, be secured in favour of the
superior, as a real burden on the land subject to the feu, bind-
ing on the proprietor of the feu for the time being, in the same
manner and subject to the same remedies as the feuduty
redeemed.

(6) At any time after the date of the obligation specified in
subsection ( 1) above or ( where there was no such obligation)

prietor of the feu for the time being or his agent may give to the
superior or his agent a notice of redemption in or as nearly
as may be in the form contained in Schedule 2 to this Act ;
and, subject to subsections ( 7) and (8) below, at the expiry of
the period of two months after the giving of such notice or
after the date of redemption, whichever is later, the land subject
to the feu shall cease to be burdened by the unpaid redemption
money and interest referred to in subsection (5) above, and by
any feuduty unpaid in respect of the feu, liability for which
has accrued up to and including the date of redemption, and any
interest or other payment exigible in respect of that feuduty,
and thereafter ( subject to the said subsections (7) and (8)) no
action shall lie against any person in respect of any sum specified
in this subsection, other than-
( a ) in the case of the redemption money or interest thereon,
against the person who was the proprietor of the feu
immediately before the date of the said obligation or
of the execution of the said deed, as the case may be,
or against his representatives ;
( b) in the case of the said unpaid feuduty or interest or
other payment relative thereto, against any person who
was liable therefor immediately before the date of
redemption, or against his representatives.
(7) If, before the end of the relevant period of two months
specified in subsection (6) above, the superior has obtained
warrant to cite the defender in an action against any person
mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) thereof or his representatives
for the recovery of any sum for which that person remains liable
in terms of those paragraphs, the court may at any time within
the said period (whether or not the defender has been cited in
the action) order that the land subject to the feu shall, in respect
of that sum, continue to be burdened, and that the sum shall
continue to be exigible, as specified in subsection (5 ) above, for
such additional period (which the court may by further order
extend from time to time if necessary) as is reasonable to enable
the superior to recover the said sum ; but the superior shall not
be entitled to recover any such sum from or at the expense of
any person whose liability therefor arose at or after the date
specified in relation to such sum in the said paragraph ( a) or ( b) ,
unless the court is satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable
to recover such sum from any person who remains liable therefor
in terms of that paragraph.
( 8) No order under subsection (7) above shall have effect
unless an extract thereof has been recorded in the Register of

at the expense of the superior, if so requested return one copy
with an acknowledgement thereon subscribed by him.
(10) The deemed redemption of feuduty in accordance with
this section shall be binding on all persons having interest :
Provided that such redemption shall not prejudice the rights of
existing heritable creditors, but the superior shall be liable to
indemnify any proprietor of the feu against liability arising after
the date of redemption from such rights.
( 11 ) For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that this
section shall have effect whether or not the obligation to grant
a conveyance as aforesaid has been implemented.
(12 ) Subsections ( 6) and ( 7) of section 4 of this Act shall
apply in relation to this section as they apply in relation to that
section, with the addition in subsection ( 7), after the words

may be) the execution of the deed there referred to and

Act shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section 20 of the
Land Compensation (Scotland ) Act 1963, apply in relation to
such acquisition as it applies in relation to the acquisition of land
to which the said section 5 applies, with the substitution, for the
reference to the person who was the proprietor of the feu immedi-
ately before the date of the obligation or (as the case may be)

redeemed in terms of this section is subject to any trust, liferent
or entail, the redemption money shall be treated for all purposes
as capital money.
( 7) In this section,
" authority possessing compulsory purchase powers " has
the same meaning as is conferred by section 275( 1 ) of

the feuduty (if any) as may be settled thereon under
section 109 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation
(Scotland) Act 1845 as applied by this section or, in the
case specified in subsection (4 ) above, by paragraph

in any such sub- lease (of whatever duration) or the

provisions of this section, be entitled to plead in the action any
defence which could be pleaded by the defender in the action.
( 3) The defence provided under section 9(4) of this Act shall
not be available to the lessee in a lease in respect of the use
of property subject to a sub-lease derived from that lease.

defence provided by section 9( 4) of this Act in an action by the
lessor in the sub- lease, may, on being sisted to an action under
the said section 9 by the lessor in any over- lease, plead that
defence in relation to the approval by the lessor in that over-
lease or in any sub-lease under that over-lease of property which
is subject to the use constituting the ground of action ; and the
court, on being satisfied that the defence is established to that
effect, shall be entitled to decern in terms of the said section 9(4)
as if the action had been brought by the lessor in the sub-lease
first mentioned.

( 2) In the case of a hire-purchase or conditional sale agreement
only, a time order under section 129(2) (a) may deal with sums

owner before the commencement of the period specified in a

shall grant the application in full or in part.
( 2) Where in proceedings relating to a regulated consumer
hire agreement the court makes an order for the delivery to the
owner of goods to which the agreement relates the court may
include in the order the like provision as may be made in an
order under subsection ( 1).
133. (1) If, in relation to a regulated hire -purchase or con-
ditional sale agreement, it appears to the court just to do so-
( a) on an application for an enforcement order or time
order ; or
( b) in an action brought by the creditor to recover posses-
sion of goods to which the agreement relates,
the court may-
(i) make an order (a 66
return order ") for the
return to the creditor of goods to which the agree-
ment relates ;
(ii ) make an order (a " transfer order ") for the
transfer to the debtor of the creditor's title to certain
goods to which the agreement relates ( " the trans-
ferred goods ") , and the return to the creditor of the
remainder of the goods.
( 2 ) In determining for the purposes of this section how much

sum;
(b) deduct any sum owed by the debtor in relation to the
goods (otherwise than as part of the total price) from
the paid-up sum,
and make corresponding reductions in amounts so owed.
(3) Where a transfer order is made, the transferred goods
shall be such of the goods to which the agreement relates as
the court thinks just ; but a transfer order shall be made only
where the paid-up sum exceeds the part of the total price
referable to the transferred goods by an amount equal to at
least one-third of the unpaid balance of the total price.

Consumer Credit Act 1974 857
( 4) Notwithstanding the making of a return order or transfer

order, the debtor may at any time before the goods enter the JUDICIAL
possession of the creditor, on payment of the balance of the total CONTROL
price and the fulfilment of any other necessary conditions, claim
the goods ordered to be returned to the creditor.
(5 ) When, in pursuance of a time order or under this section,
the total price of goods under a regulated hire-purchase agree-
ment or regulated conditional sale agreement is paid and any
other necessary conditions are fulfilled, the creditor's title to the
goods vests in the debtor.
( 6 ) If , in contravention of a return order or transfer order,
any goods to which the order relates are not returned to the
creditor, the court, on the application of the creditor, may-
(a ) revoke so much of the order as relates to those goods,
and
(b) order the debtor to pay the creditor the unpaid portion
of so much of the total price as is referable to those
goods.
( 7 ) For the purposes of this section, the part of the total
price referable to any goods is the part assigned to those goods
by the agreement or (if no such assignment is made) the part
determined by the court to be reasonable.

or that, after the right to recover possession of the
goods accrued but before the action was begun or
the application was made, he made a request in writing
to the debtor or hirer to surrender the goods ,
then, for the purposes of the claim of the creditor or owner
to recover possession of the goods, the possession of them
by the debtor or hirer shall be deemed to be adverse to the
creditor or owner.
( 2) In subsection ( 1) " the debtor or hirer " includes a person
in possession of the goods at any time between the debtor's
or hirer's death and the grant of probate or administration, or

EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE 1
Facts. Correspondence passes between an employee of a money-
lending company ( writing on behalf of the company) and an
individual about the terms on which the company would grant him
a loan under a regulated agreement.
Analysis. The correspondence constitutes antecedent negotiations
falling within section 56( 1)(a) , the moneylending company being both
creditor and negotiator.
c . 39
Consumer Credit Act 1974 903
EXAMPLE 2
Facts . Representations are made about goods in a poster displayed
by a shopkeeper near the goods, the goods being selected by a
customer who has read the poster and then sold by the shopkeeper
to a finance company introduced by him (with whom he has a
business relationship ). The goods are disposed of by the finance
company to the customer under a regulated hire-purchase agreement.
Analysis. The representations in the poster constitute antecedent
negotiations falling within section 56(1)(b), the shopkeeper being the
credit-broker and negotiator and the finance company being the
creditor. The poster is an advertisement and the shopkeeper is
the advertiser.
EXAMPLE 3
Facts. Discussions take place between a shopkeeper and a
customer about goods the customer wishes to buy using a credit-card
issued by the D Bank under a regulated agreement.
Analysis. The discussions constitute antecedent negotiations falling
within section 56(1)( c ), the shopkeeper being the supplier and
negotiator and the D Bank the creditor. The credit-card is a credit-
token as defined in section 14(1), and the regulated agreement under
which it was issued is a credit- token agreement as defined in section
14( 2).
EXAMPLE 4
Facts. Discussions take place and correspondence passes between
a secondhand car dealer and a customer about a car, which is then
sold by the dealer to the customer under a regulated conditional sale
agreement. Subsequently, on a revocation of that agreement by
consent , the car is resold by the dealer to a finance company intro-
duced by him ( with whom he has a business relationship), who in
turn dispose of it to the same customer under a regulated hire-
purchase agreement.
Analysis. The discussions and correspondence constitute ante-
cedent negotiations in relation both to the conditional sale agreement
and the hire-purchase agreement. They fall under section 56(1 )( a)
in relation to the conditional sale agreement, the dealer being the
creditor and the negotiator. In relation to the hire- purchase agree-
ment they fall within section 56(1)(b), the dealer continuing to be
treated as the negotiator but the finance company now being the
creditor Both agreements are cancellable if the discussions took
place when the individual conducting the negotiations ( whether the
" negotiator " or his employee or agent) was in the presence of the
debtor, unless the unexecuted agreement was signed by the debtor
at trade premises (as defined in section 67( b) ) If the discussions
all took place by telephone however, or the unexecuted agreement
was signed by the debtor on trade premises (as so defined) the agree-
ments are not cancellable.
SCH. 2
EXAMPLE 5
Facts E agrees to sell to F (an individual ) an item of furniture in
return for 24 monthly instalments of £10 payable in arrear.
The
property in the goods passes to F immediately.
2F4
c . 39
904 Consumer Credit Act 1974
SCH. 2 Analysis. This is a credit-sale agreement (see definition of " credit-
sale agreement " in section 189(1)). The credit provided amounts to
£ 240 less the amount which, according to regulations made under
section 20(1 ), constitutes the total charge for credit . ( This amount
is required to be deducted by section 9( 4) ). Accordingly the agree-
ment falls within section 8( 2) and is a consumer credit agreement.
EXAMPLE 6
Facts. The G Bank grants H (an individual ) an unlimited over-
draft, with an increased rate of interest on so much of any debit
balance as exceeds £2,000.
Analysis. Although the overdraft purports to be unlimited, the
stipulation for increased interest above £ 2,000 brings the agreement
within section 10( 3)(b)(ii ) and it is a consumer credit agreement.
EXAMPLE 7
Facts. Jis an individual who owns a small shop which usually
carries a stock worth about £1,000. K makes a stocking agreement
under which he undertakes to provide on short- term credit the stock
needed from time to time by J without any specified limit.
Analysis. Although the agreement appears to provide unlimited
credit, it is probable, having regard to the stock usually carried by J,
that his indebtedness to K will not at any time rise above £ 5,000.
Accordingly the agreement falls within section 10( 3)( b)(iii) and is a
consumer credit agreement.
EXAMPLE 8
Facts. U, a moneylender, lends £500 to V (an individual) knowing
he intends to use it to buy office equipment from W. W introduced
V to U, it being his practice to introduce customers needing finance
to him. Sometimes U gives W a commission for this and sometimes
not . U pays the £500 direct to V.
Analysis. Although this appears to fall under section 11 (1 )(b),
it is excluded by section 11( 3) and is therefore ( by section 11(2)) an
unrestricted-use credit agreement. Whether it is a debtor-creditor
agreement (by section 13( c)) or a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement
( by section 12( c )) depends on whether the previous dealings between
U and Wamount to 66
pre-existing arrangements ", that is whether
the agreement can be taken to have been entered into " in accordance
with, or in furtherance of " arrangements previously made between
U and W, as laid down in section 187(1).
EXAMPLE 9
Facts. A agrees to lend B (an individual ) £ 4,500 in nine monthly
instalments of £500.
Analysis. This is a cash loan and is a form of credit (see section 9
and definition of " cash " in section 189(1)). Accordingly it falls
within section 10(1 )(b ) and is fixed-sum credit amounting to £ 4,500.
c . 39
Consumer Credit Act 1974 905
EXAMPLE 10
Facts. C (in England ) agrees to bail goods to D (an individual )
in return for periodical payments. The agreement provides for
the property in the goods to pass to D on payment of a total of
£7,500 and the exercise by D of an option to purchase. The sum
of £7,500 includes a down-payment of £1,000. It also includes an
amount which, according to regulations made under section 20(1),
constitutes a total charge for credit of £1,500.
Analysis. This is a hire-purchase agreement with a deposit of
£1,000 and a total price of £7,500 ( see definitions of " hire- purchase
agreement " , " deposit " and " total price " in section 189(1)). By
section 9( 3), it is taken to provide credit amounting to £7,500-
(£1,500 + £1,000), which equals £ 5,000. Under section 8(2), the
agreement is therefore a consumer credit agreement, and under
sections 9( 3) and 11(1) it is a restricted-use credit agreement for fixed-
sum credit. A similar result would follow if the agreement by C
had been a hiring agreement in Scotland.
SCH. 2
EXAMPLE 11
Facts. X (an individual) borrows £ 500 from Y (Finance). As a
condition of the granting of the loan X is required-
( a ) to execute a second mortgage on his house in favour of
Y ( Finance ) , and
( b ) to take out a policy of insurance on his life with Y
( Insurances ).
In accordance with the loan agreement, the policy is charged to
Y(Finance ) as collateral security for the loan. The two companies
are associates within the meaning of section 184( 3).
Analysis. The second mortgage is a transaction for the provision
of security and accordingly does not fall within section 19(1), but
the taking out of the insurance policy is a linked transaction falling
within section 19(1) (a ). The charging of the policy is a separate
transaction ( made between different parties ) for the provision of
security and again is excluded from section 19( 1). The only linked
transaction is therefore the taking out of the insurance policy. If
X had not been required by the loan agreement to take out the
policy, but it had been done at the suggestion of Y ( Finance) to
induce them to enter into the loan agreement, it would have been a
linked transaction under section 19(1)( c )(i) by virtue of section
19( 2)( a ).
EXAMPLE 12
Facts. The N Bank agrees to lend O (an individual) £2,000 to
buy a car from P. To make sure the loan is used as intended, the
N Bank stipulates that the money must be paid by it direct to P.
Analysis. The agreement is a consumer credit agreement by virtue
of section 8( 2). Since it falls within section 11(1)( b), it is a restricted-
use credit agreement, P being the supplier. If the N Bank had not
c. 39
906 Consumer Credit Act 1974
SCH. 2 stipulated for direct payment to the supplier, section 11(3) would
have operated and made the agreement into one for unrestricted-use
credit.
EXAMPLE 13
Facts. Q, a debt -adjuster, agrees to pay off debts owed by R (an
individual) to various moneylenders. For this purpose the agreement
provides for the making of a loan by Q to R in return for R's
agreeing to repay the loan by instalments with interest. The loan
money is not paid over to R but retained by Q and used to pay off
the moneylenders.
Analysis. This is an agreement to refinance existing indebtedness
of the debtor's, and if the loan by Q does not exceed £ 5,000 is a
restricted- use credit agreement falling within section 11 (1)( c).
EXAMPLE 14
Facts. On payment of £ 1 , S issues to T (an individual) a trading
check under which T can spend up to £20 at any shop which has
agreed, or in future agrees, to accept S's trading checks.
Analysis. The trading check is a credit -token falling within section
14( 1)(b). The credit- token agreement is a restricted- use credit agree-
ment within section 11(1)(b), any shop in which the credit-token is
used being the " supplier ". The fact that further shops may be
added after the issue of the credit-token is irrelevant in view of
section 11 ( 4 ).
EXAMPLE 15
Facts. A retailer Lagrees with M (an individual ) to open an
account in M's name and, in return for M's promise to pay a specified
minimum sum into the account each month and to pay a monthly
charge for credit, agrees to allow to be debited to the account, in
respect of purchases made by M from L, such sums as will not
increase the debit balance at any time beyond the credit limit,
defined in the agreement as a given multiple of the specified
minimum sum.
Analysis. This agreement provides credit falling within the
definition of running-account credit in section 10(1)(a ). Provided
the credit limit is not over £5,000, the agreement falls within section
8( 2) and is a consumer credit agreement for running-account credit.
EXAMPLE 16
Facts. Under an unsecured agreement , A (Credit), an associate
of the A Bank, issues to B (an individual ) a credit-card for use in
obtaining cash on credit from A (Credit), to be paid by branches
of the A Bank (acting as agent of A ( Credit )), or goods or cash
from suppliers or banks who have agreed to honour credit-cards
issued by A(Credit ). The credit limit is £30.
Analysis. This is a credit-token agreement falling within section
14(1)( a) and (b). It is a regulated consumer credit agreement for
c . 39
Consumer Credit Act 1974 907
running-account credit. Since the credit limit does not exceed £ 30, the agreement is a small agreement. So far as the agreement
relates to goods it is a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement within
section 12(b) , since it provides restricted-use credit under section
11 (1)(b) . So far as it relates to cash it is a debtor-creditor agreement
within section 13( c ) and the credit it provides is unrestricted-use
credit. This is therefore a multiple agreement. In that the whole
agreement falls within several of the categories of agreement men-
tioned in this Act, it is, by section 18( 3), to be treated as an agree-
ment in each of those categories. So far as it is a debtor- creditor-
supplier agreement providing restricted-use credit it is, by section
18( 2), to be treated as a separate agreement ; and similarly so far
as it is a debtor-creditor agreement providing unrestricted- use
credit. (See also Example 22.)
EXAMPLE 17
Facts. The manager of the C Bank agrees orally with D (an
individual) to open a current account in D's name. Nothing is said
about overdraft facilities. After maintaining the account in credit
for some weeks, D draws a cheque in favour of E for an amount
exceeding D's credit balance by £ 20. E presents the cheque and the
Bank pay it.
Analysis. In drawing the cheque D, by implication, requests the
Bank to grant him an overdraft of £ 20 on its usual terms as to
interest and other charges. In deciding to honour the cheque, the
Bank by implication accept the offer. This constitutes a regulated
small consumer credit agreement for unrestricted- use, fixed- sum
credit. It is a debtor-creditor agreement, and falls within section
74( 1 )(b) if covered by a determination under section 74( 3). (Compare
Example 18.) EXAMPLE 18
Facts. F (an individual ) has had a current account with the
G Bank for many years. Although usually in credit, the account
has been allowed by the Bank to become overdrawn from time to
time. The maximum such overdraft has been is about £1,000. No
explicit agreement has ever been made about overdraft facilities.
Now, with a credit balance of £ 500, F draws a cheque for £1,300.
Analysis. It might well be held that the agreement with F (express
or implied) under which the Bank operate his account includes an
implied term giving him the right to overdraft facilities up to say
£1,000. If so, the agreement is a regulated consumer credit agree-
ment for unrestricted- use, running- account credit. It is a debtor-
creditor agreement, and falls within section 74( 1)(b) if covered by
a direction under section 74( 3). It is also a multiple agreement,
part of which (i.e. the part not dealing with the overdraft), as
referred to in section 18(1)(a), falls within a category of agreement
not mentioned in this Act. (Compare Example 17. )
EXAMPLE 19
Facts . H (a finance house) agrees with J (a partnership of
individuals) to open an unsecured loan account in J's name on which
the debit balance is not to exceed £7,000 (having regard to payments
SCH. 2
c . 39
908 Consumer Credit Act 1974
SCH . 2 into the account made from time to time by J ). Interest is to be
payable in advance on this sum, with provision for yearly adjustments.
H is entitled to debit the account with interest , a" setting-up " charge ,
and other charges. Before J has an opportunity to draw on the
account it is initially debited with £2,250 for advance interest and
other charges.
Analysis. This is a personal running-account credit agreement
(see sections 8(1) and 10(1)(a ), and definition of " individual " in
section 189( 1) ). By section 10(2 ) the credit limit is £7,000. By
section 9(4) however the initial debit of £2,250, and any other charges
later debited to the account by H, are not to be treated as credit
even though time is allowed for their payment. Effect is given to
this by section 10( 3). Although the credit limit of £7,000 exceeds
the amount (£5,000) specified in section 8(2) as the maximum for a
consumer credit agreement, so that the agreement is not within
section 10(3)(a), it is caught by section 10( 3)(b)(i). At the beginning
J can effectively draw (as credit ) no more than £ 4,750, so the
agreement is a consumer credit agreement.
EXAMPLE 20
Facts. K (in England ) agrees with L ( an individual ) to bail goods
to L for a period of three years certain at £ 2,000 a year, payable
quarterly. The agreement contains no provision for the passing of
the property in the goods to L.
Analysis. This is not a hire-purchase agreement ( see paragraph
(b) of the definition of that term in section 189(1)), and is capable
of subsisting for more than three months. Paragraphs (a) and (b)
of section 15(1) are therefore satisfied, but paragraph ( c ) is not.
The payments by L must exceed £ 5,000 if he conforms to the
agreement. It is true that under section 101 L has a right to
terminate the agreement on giving K three months' notice expiring
not earlier than eighteen months after the making of the agreement,
but that section applies only where the agreement is a regulated
consumer hire agreement apart from the section ( see subsection (1)).
So the agreement is not a consumer hire agreement, though it
would be if the hire charge were say £1,500 a year, or there were
a " break " clause in it operable by either party before the hire
charges exceeded £ 5,000. A similar result would follow if the
agreement by K had been a hiring agreement in Scotland.
EXAMPLE 21
Facts. The P Bank decides to issue cheque cards to its customers
under a scheme whereby the bank undertakes to honour cheques of
up to £ 30 in every case where the payee has taken the cheque in
reliance on the cheque card, whether the customer has funds in
his account or not. The P Bank writes to the major retailers advising
them of this scheme and also publicises it by advertising. The
Bank issues a cheque card to Q (an individual ), who uses it to pay
by cheque for goods costing £20 bought by Q from R, a major
retailer. At the time, Q has £500 in his account at the P Bank.
c . 39
Consumer Credit Act 1974 909
Analysis. The agreement under which the cheque card is issued
to Q is a consumer credit agreement even though at all relevant
times Q has more than £30 in his account. This is because Qis
free to draw out his whole balance and then use the cheque card,
in which case the Bank has bound itself to honour the cheque. In
other words the cheque card agreement provides Q with credit,
whether he avails himself of it or not. Since the amount of the
credit is not subject to any express limit, the cheque card can be
used any number of times. It may be presumed however that
section 10(3)(b)(iii) will apply. The agreement is an unrestricted-use
debtor-creditor agreement ( by section 13( c) ). Although the P Bank
wrote to R informing R of the P Bank's willingness to honour any
cheque taken by R in reliance on a cheque card, this does not
constitute pre-existing arrangements as mentioned in section 13( c )
because section 187( 3 ) operates to prevent it . The agreement is not a
credit-token agreement within section 14(1)( b) because payment by
the P Bank to R, would be a payment of the cheque and not a
payment for the goods.
EXAMPLE 22
Facts. The facts are as in Example 16. On one occasion B uses
the credit-card in a way which increases his debit balance with
A (Credit ) to £ 40. A ( Credit) writes to B agreeing to allow the
excess on that occasion only, but stating that it must be paid off
within one month.
Analysis. In exceeding his credit limit B, by implication, requests
A (Credit) to allow him a temporary excess ( compare Example 17 ).
A(Credit) is thus faced by B's action with the choice of treating it as
a breach of contract or granting his implied request. He does the
latter. If he had done the former, B would be treated as taking
credit to which he was not entitled (see section 14( 3)) and, subject to
the terms of his contract with A(Credit ), would be liable to damages
for breach of contract. As it is, the agreement to allow the excess
varies the original credit-token agreement by adding a new term.
Under section 10( 2 ), the new term is to be disregarded in arriving at
the credit limit, so that the credit-token agreement at no time ceases
to be a small agreement. By section 82( 2 ) the later agreement is
deemed to revoke the original agreement and contain provisions
reproducing the combined effect of the two agreements. By section
82( 4), this later agreement is exempted from Part V( except section 56 ).
EXAMPLE 23
Facts. Under an oral agreement made on 10th January, X (an
individual) has an overdraft on his current account at the Y bank
with a credit limit of £100. On 15th February, when his overdraft
stands at £90, X draws a cheque for £25. It is the first time that
X has exceeded his credit limit , and on 16th February the bank
honours the cheque.
Analysis. The agreement of 10th January is a consumer credit
agreement for running-account credit. The agreement of 15th- 16th
February varies the earlier agreement by adding a term allowing
the credit limit to be exceeded merely temporarily. By section 82( 2)
SCH. 2
c . 39
910 Consumer Credit Act 1974
SCH. 2 the later agreement is deemed to revoke the earlier agreement and
reproduce the combined effect of the two agreements. By section
82( 4), Part V of this Act ( except section 56 ) does not apply to the
later agreement. By section 18( 5), a term allowing a merely tem-
porary excess over the credit limit is not to be treated as a separate
agreement, or as providing fixed-sum credit. The whole of the £115
owed to the bank by X on 16th February is therefore running- account
credit.
EXAMPLE 24
Facts. On 1st March 1975 Z (in England) enters into an agreement
with A (an unincorporated body of persons ) to bail to A equipment
consisting of two components (component P and component Q).
The agreement is not a hire-purchase agreement and is for a fixed
term of 3 years, so paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 15(1) are both
satisfied. The rental is payable monthly at a rate of £2,400 a year,
but the agreement provides that this is to be reduced to £1,200 a
year for the remainder of the agreement if at any time during its
currency A returns component Q to the owner Z. On 5th May 1976 A
is incorporated as A Ltd., taking over A's assets and liabilities. On
1st March 1977, A Ltd. returns component Q. On 1st January 1978,
Z and A Ltd. agree to extend the earlier agreement by one year,
increasing the rental for the final year by £250 to £1,450.
Analysis. When entered into on 1st March 1975, the agreement
is a consumer hire agreement. A falls within the definition of
" individual " in section 189(1) and if A returns component Q before
1st May 1976 the total rental will not exceed £5,000 (see section
15(1)(c)). When this date is passed without component Q having
been returned it is obvious that the total rental must now exceed
£ 5,000. Does this mean that the agreement then ceases to be a
consumer hire agreement? The answer is no, because there has been
no change in the terms of the agreement, and without such a change
the agreement cannot move from one category to the other. Similarly,
the fact that A's rights and duties under the agreement pass to
a body corporate on 5th May 1976 does not cause the agreement
to cease to be a consumer hire agreement ( see the definition of
66 hirer " in section 189(1)).
The effect of the modifying agreement of 1st January 1978 is
governed by section 82( 2), which requires it to be treated as containing
provisions reproducing the combined effect of the two actual agree-
ments, that is to say as providing that-
( a ) obligations outstanding on 1st January 1978 are to be treated
as outstanding under the modifying agreement ;
( b) the modifying agreement applies at the old rate of hire for the
months of January and February 1978, and
( c ) for the year beginning 1st March 1978 A Ltd. will be the
bailee of component Pat a rental of £1,450.
The total rental under the modifying agreement is £1,850.
Accordingly the modifying agreement is a regulated agreement. Even
if the total rental under the modifying agreement exceeded £ 5,000 it
would still be regulated because of the provisions of section 82( 3).

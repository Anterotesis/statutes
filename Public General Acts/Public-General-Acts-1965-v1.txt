(4) A determination of the Secretary of State whereby a body which is for the time being represented on a committee constituted under this section will cease to be so represented (except in a case where that body will have ceased to exist before the time when the determination is to take effect) shall not have effect unless it is embodied in an order made by the Secretary of State.

(5) Any order under the last preceding subsection may be revoked by a subsequent order made by the Secretary of State.

(6) Any power to make orders under this section shall be exercisable by statutory instrument; and any statutory instrument containing an order under subsection (4) of this section shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.

Finance Act 1965

Part m (3) Subject, in the case of an individual, to the next following section, and subject to section 82 of this Act, the rate of capital gains tax shall be thirty per cent

(4) Capital gains tax shall be charged at the said rate on the total amount of chargeable gains accruing to the person chargeable in the year of assessment after deducting any allowable losses accruing to that person in that year of assessment and, so far as they have not been allowed as a deduction from chargeable gains accruing in any previous year of assessment, any allowable losses accruing to that person in any previous year of assessment (not earlier than the year 1965-66).

(5) In the case of a woman who in a year of assessment is a married woman living with her husband any allowable loss accruing in that year of assessment which, under the last foregoing subsection, would be deductible from the chargeable gains accruing in that year of assessment to the one but for an insufficiency of chargeable gains shall, for the purposes of that subsection, be deductible from chargeable gains accruing in that year of assessment to the other:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply in relation to losses accruing in a year of assessment to either if, before 6th July in the year next following that year of assessment, an application is made by the man or the wife to the inspector in such form and manner as the Board may prescribe.

(6) Capital gains tax assessed on any person in respect of gains accruing in any year shall be payable by that person at or before the expiration of the three months following that year, or at the expiration of a period of thirty days beginning with the date of making the assessment, whichever is the later.

(7) In the case of individuals resident or ordinarily resident but not domiciled in the United Kingdom, capital gains tax shall not be charged in respect of gains accruing to them from the disposal of assets situated outside the United Kingdom (that is chargeable gains accruing in the year 1965-66 or a later year of assessment) except that the tax shall be charged on the amounts (if any) received in the United Kingdom in respect of those chargeable gains, any such amounts being treated as gains accruing when they are received in the United Kingdom; and accordingly losses accruing on the disposal of assets situated outside the United Kingdom to any such individual shall not be allowable under this Part of this Act

Capital gains accruing to an individual: alternative charge to tax.

21.—(1) If this section would result in an individual being chargeable to a reduced amount of capital gains tax for any year of assessment in any part of which he was resident in the United Kingdom, or in which he was ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, the amount of capital gains tax to

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

423

which he is chargeable for that year of assessment shall, instead Part in of being the amount arrived at under the last foregoing section, be calculated as an amount equal to the amount of income tax (including surtax) to which he would be chargeable if, in addition to any other liability to income tax, he was chargeable to income tax for that year under Case VI of Schedule D—

(a) where the amount on which he would have been

chargeable to capital gains tax for that year under the last foregoing section does not exceed five thousand pounds, on a sum equal to one-half of that amount, and

(b) where that amount exceeds five thousand pounds, on a

sum equal to two thousand five hundred pounds plus the excess of that amount over five thousand pounds.

(2) That amount of income tax (including surtax) shall be arrived at on the assumption that the income to which the individual would be so chargeable to income tax—

(a) is not available for set off under any of the provisions

of the Income Tax Acts against any loss, or against any payments which may be made out of profits or gains brought into charge for tax, and is not available for the purpose of any other relief under the Income Tax Acts, other than the personal reliefs, and accordingly it shall be assumed that all such provisions of the Income Tax Acts are applied without regard to the income so chargeable under Case VI of Schedule D,

(b) does not constitute earned income, as being income

within section 525(l)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1952 1952 c. 10. (income from property attached to or forming part of the emoluments of an office or employment) or within any other provision of the Income Tax Acts,

(c) is to be treated, for the purpose of comparing in accor-

dance with subsection (1) of this section the amount of income tax which would be chargeable under this section with the alternative charge to capital gains tax, as the highest part of the individual’s income for the year,

and paragraph (c) of this subsection shall have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Income Tax Acts directing other income to be treated as the highest part of the individual’s total income.

In this subsection “the personal reliefs” means the reliefs under Part VIII of the Income Tax Act 1952, as applied for the purposes of income tax at the standard rate or surtax but excluding relief under sections 219 and 225 (premiums on life assurance policies).

Finance Act 1965

Part in (3) The provisions of this section shall not affect the provisions of the last foregoing section as to the circumstances in which an allowable loss accruing in one year may be deducted from chargeable gains accruing in any other year.

(4) If capital gains tax is chargeable under the last foregoing section in respect of chargeable gains accruing to a married woman who in the year of assessment is a married woman living with her husband, then, whether or not the husband is or would be chargeable to capital gains tax for that year of assessment under the last foregoing section, and whether or not the married woman is separately assessed to income tax at the standard rate or to surtax—

(a) in making the comparison under subsection (1) of this

section account shall be taken of income tax chargeable on the husband, as well as of income tax chargeable on the woman, and

(b) the reference to the individual's income in subsection

(2)(c) of this section shall be a reference to the husband's income (including income of his wife which under the Income Tax Acts is deemed to be his income), and

(c) if both the married woman and her husband are charge-

able to capital gains tax for that year of assessment the comparison under subsection (1) of this section shall be between the sum of the capital gains tax so chargeable on them under the last foregoing section and the amount to which the husband would be chargeable to income tax (including surtax) if. in addition to any other liability to income tax, he was chargeable to income tax for that year of assessment under Case VI of Schedule D—

(i) where the aggregate amount to which he and his wife would have been chargeable to capital gains tax for that year under the last foregoing section does not exceed five thousand pounds, on a sum equal to one-half of that amount, and

(ii) where that aggregate amount exceeds five thousand pounds, on a sum equal to two thousand five hundred pounds plus the excess of that aggregate amount over five thousand pounds,

and

(d) account shall be taken of the provisions of subsection

(5) of the last foregoing section with any necessary adjustment where an application is made under the proviso to that subsection, and any reduction in capital gains tax effected by paragraph (c) above shall be apportioned to the husband and wife in proportion to the respective amounts on which they would, under

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

425

the last foregoing section, be chargeable to capital gains tax Part m for the year of assessment

(5) Any chargeable gain which accrued to an individual in a year of assessment on the disposal of an asset which the individual acquired (otherwise than as legatee) not more than two years before the disposal from a person who, in the terms of paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to this Act, was a person connected with the individual shall be left out of account for the purposes of this section, and—

(a) capital gains tax shall be charged on the amount of that

chargeable gain in accordance with the last foregoing section,

(b) no loss shall be deductible under subsection (4) of the

last foregoing section from that amount if relief is given under this section in respect of any other chargeable gain which accrued to the individual or, in accordance with subsection (4) of this section, to the husband or wife of the individual, in the said year of assessment

(6) The conveyance or transfer by way of security of an asset or of an interest or right in or over it, or transfer of a subsisting interest or right by way of security in or over an asset (including

23.—(1) Except as otherwise expressly provided, the amount Losses, of a loss accruing on a disposal of an asset shall be computed in the same way as the amount of a gain accruing on a disposal is computed.

(2) Except as otherwise expressly provided, all the provisions of this Part of this Act which distinguish gains which are chargeable gains from those which are not, or which make part of a gain a chargeable gain, and part not, shall apply also to distinguish losses which are allowable losses from those which are not, and to make part of a loss an allowable loss, and

(5) For the purposes of the two last foregoing subsections a building and any permanent or semi-permanent structure in the nature of a building, may be regarded as an asset separate from the land on which it is situated, but where either of those subsections applies in accordance with this subsection, the person deemed to make the disposal of the building shall be treated as if he had also sold, and immediately re-acquired, the site of the building or structure (including in the site any land occupied for purposes ancillary to the use of the building or structure) for a consideration equal to its market value at that time.

(6) A loss accruing to a person in a year of assessment during no part of which he is resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom shall not be an allowable loss for the purposes of this Part of this Act unless, under section 20(2) of this Act, he would be chargeable to capital gains tax in respect of a chargeable gain if there had been a gain instead of a loss on that occasion.

(7) Except as provided by the next following section, an allowable loss accruing in a year of assessment shall not be allowable as a deduction from chargeable gains accruing in any earlier year of assessment, and relief shall not be given under this Part of this Act more than once in respect of any loss or part of a loss, and shall not be given under this Part of this Act if and so far as relief has been or may be given in respect of it under the Income Tax Acts.

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

429

person on whom they devolve, for a consideration equal to their Part in market value at that date.

(2) Subject to section 34 of this Act, the gains which accrue in consequence of subsection (1) of this section, together with any gains accruing to the deceased by reason of the disposal by him of any asset by way of donatio mortis causa, shall be aggregated and only so much of that aggregate as exceeds five thousand pounds shall constitute chargeable gains.

In arriving at the aggregate—

(a) the respective amounts of the gains shall be computed

in accordance with the provisions of this Act (other than this section) fixing the amount of chargeable gains, and

(b) any allowable loss accruing in consequence of subsec-

tion (1) of this section, or in consequence of any donatio mortis causa, shall be deducted, and the provisions of this subsection shall not affect the computation of the amount of any allowable loss.

(3) For the purposes of section 20(4) of this Act chargeable gains under subsection (2) of this section shall be included in the gains accruing to the deceased in the year of assessment in which the death occurs.

(4) For the purposes of the said section 20(4) and of the next following subsection allowable losses sustained in consequence of subsection (1) of this section shall be included in the losses sustained by the deceased in the year of assessment in which the death occurs so far as those losses have not been taken into account under subsection (2) of this section.

(5) Allowable losses sustained by an individual in the year of assessment in which he dies may, so far as they cannot be deducted from chargeable gains accruing in that year, be deducted from chargeable gains accruing to the deceased in the three years of assessment preceding the year of assessment in which the death occurs, taking chargeable gains accruing in a later year before those accruing in an earlier year.

(6) In relation to property forming part of the estate of a deceased person the personal representatives shall for the purposes of this Part of this Act be treated as being a single and continuing body of persons (distinct from the persons who may from time to time be the personal representatives), and that body shall be treated as having the deceased’s residence, ordinary residence, and domicile at the date of death.

(7) On a person acquiring any asset as legatee—

(a) no chargeable gain shall accrue to the personal representatives, and

(b) the legatee shall be treated as if the personal representatives' acquisition of the asset had been his acquisition of it.

(8) Allowable losses which accrue to the personal representatives of a deceased person in the period of three years from the death, may, so far as they cannot otherwise be deducted from chargeable gains, be deducted from chargeable gains accruing to the deceased in the year of assessment in which the death occurs, or in the preceding three years of assessment, taking chargeable gains accruing in a later year before those accruing in an earlier year.

(9) In this section references to assets of which a deceased person was competent to dispose are references to assets of the deceased which (otherwise than in right of a power of appointment or of the testamentary power conferred by statute to dispose of entailed interests) he could, if of full age and capacity, have disposed of by his will, assuming that all the assets were situated in England and, if he was not domiciled in the United Kingdom, that he was domiciled in England.

(10) For the purposes of this section in its application to Scotland, where the deceased person was an heir of entail in possession of an entailed estate, whether sui iuris or not, or a proper liferenter of an estate, he shall be deemed to have been a person competent to dispose of such estate.

(11) If not more than two years after a death any of the dispositions of the property of which the deceased was competent to dispose, whether effected by will, or under the law relating to intestacies, or otherwise, are varied by a deed of family arrangement or similar instrument, this section shall apply as if the variations made by the deed or other instrument were effected by the deceased, and no disposition made by the deed or other instrument shall constitute a disposal for the purposes of this Part of this Act.

25.—(1) In relation to settled property, the trustees of the settlement shall for the purposes of this Part of this Act be treated as being a single and continuing body of persons (distinct from the persons who may from time to time be the trustees), and that body shall be treated as being resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom unless the general administration of the trusts is ordinarily carried on outside the United Kingdom and the trustees or a majority of them for the time being are not resident or not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom:

Provided that a person carrying on a business which consists of or includes the management of trusts, and acting as trustees of a trust in the course of that business, shall be treated

in relation to that trust as not resident in the United Kingdom if the whole of the settled property consists of or derives from property provided by a person not at the time (or, in the case of a trust arising under a testamentary disposition or on an intestacy or partial intestacy, at his death) domiciled, resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.

(2) A gift in settlement, whether revocable or irrevocable, is a disposal of the entire property thereby becoming settled property notwithstanding that the donor has some interest as a beneficiary under die settlement and notwithstanding that he is a trustee, or the sole trustee, of the settlement

(3) On the occasion when a person becomes absolutely entitled to any settled property as against the trustee all the assets forming part of the settled property to which he becomes so entitled shall be deemed to have been disposed of by the trustee, and immediately reacquired by him in his capacity as a trustee within section 22(5) of this Act, for a consideration equal to their market value.

(4) On the termination at any time after 6th April 1965 of a life interest in possession in all or any part of settled property, all the assets forming part of the settled property, except any which at that time cease to be settled property, shall be deemed for the purposes of this Part of this Act at that time to be disposed of and immediately reacquired by the trustee for a consideration equal to their market value.

(5) If, in the case of the death of any individual, no relief is given under subsection (2) of the last foregoing section, or relief is so given in respect of an aggregate sum which is less than the amount available for relief under the said subsection (2), then that amount or, as the case may be, the difference between that amount and the aggregate sum in respect of which relief is so given shall be available for giving relief under this subsection, and—

(a) any gains which accrue to the trustees of a settlement

on the disposal of settled property deemed to be effected at the date of the death in accordance with subsection (3) or subsection (4) of this section on the termination of a life interest by the death, or otherwise in consequence of the death, shall be aggregated and only so much of that aggregate as exceeds the amount so available for giving relief under this subsection shall constitute chargeable gains,

(b) if subsection (6) below has operated to prevent sub-

section (4) applying on the date of the death paragraph (a) above shall apply to gains accruing on the disposal of the settled property deemed to be effected

applies,

(c) in arriving at the aggregate—

(i) the respective amounts of the gains shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act (other than this subsection) fixing the amount of chargeable gains, and

(ii) any allowable loss which accrues on the disposal shall be deducted,

and the provisions of this subsection shall not affect the computation of the amount of any allowable loss,

(d) if this subsection applies in relation to chargeable

gains accruing to more than one body of trustees on the same death, the amount available for relief under this subsection shall be apportioned between those bodies of trustees according to the respective values of the settled property which those trustees are deemed respectively to have disposed of, and the references in this subsection to the amount available for relief under subsection (2) of the last foregoing section are references to five thousand pounds, or as the case may be to that amount as reduced (or extinguished) under section 34 of this Act.

(6) If on any occasion subsection (4) of this section is applied in relation to a settlement the interval between that occasion and the next occasion on which it applies shall not be less than fifteen years, but where this subsection has operated to prevent the application of the said subsection (4), the said subsection (4) shall apply in relation to the settlement at the end of fifteen years from die occasion on which it last applied as if a life interest in possession in the settled property had terminated at the end of those fifteen years.

(7) If during the subsistence of a settlement there is a period of more than fifteen years throughout which there is no life interest in possession in the settled property, then at the end of the first fifteen years of that period, and of each succeeding fifteen years of that period, subsections (4) and (6) of this section shall apply as if a life interest in possession in the settled property had then terminated:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply to settled property if it and the income from it is wholly or primarily applicable for educational, cultural or recreational purposes, and the persons benefiting from the application for those purposes are confined to members of an association of persons for whose benefit the property was settled, not being persons all or most of whom are, in the terms of paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to this Act, connected persons.

(8) On the occasion when a person becomes absolutely entitled Part m to any settled property as against the trustee, any allowable

loss which has accrued to the trustee in respect of property which is, or is represented by, the property to which that person so becomes entitled (including any allowable loss carried forward to the year of assessment in which that occasion falls), being a loss which cannot be deducted from chargeable gains accruing to the trustee in that year, but before that occasion, shall be treated as if it were an allowable loss accruing at that time to the person becoming so entitled, instead of to the trustee.

(9) If tax assessed on the trustees, or any one trustee, of a settlement in respect of a chargeable gain accruing to the trustees is not paid within six months from the date when it becomes payable by the trustees or trustee, and before or after the expiration of that period of six months the asset in respect of which the chargeable gain accrued, or any part of the proceeds of sale of that asset, is transferred by the trustees to a person who as against the trustees is absolutely entitled to it, that person may at any time within two years from the time when the tax became payable be assessed and charged (in the name of the trustees) to an amount of capital gains tax not exceeding tax chargeable on an amount equal to the amount of the chargeable gain and, where part only of the asset or of the proceeds was transferred, not exceeding a proportionate part of that amount.

(10) In this section “ life interest ” in relation to a settlement—

(a) includes a right under the settlement to the income of,

or the use or occupation of, settled property for the life of another or for any other period which will or may terminate before all the settled property becomes property to which some person is absolutely entitled as against the trustee,

(b) does not include any right which is contingent on the

exercise of the discretion of the trustee or the discretion of some other person, and

(c) does not include an annuity, notwithstanding that the

annuity is payable out of or charged on settled property or the income of settled property.

(11) For the purposes of this section, where part of the property comprised in a settlement is vested in one trustee or set of trustees and part in another (and in particular where settled land

within the meaning of the Settled Land Act 1925 is vested in the 1925 c. 18. tenant for life and investments representing capital money are vested in the trustees of the settlement), they shall be treated as together constituting and, in so far as they act separately, as acting on behalf of a single body of trustees.

(12) If there is a life interest in a part of the settled property and, where that is a life interest in income, there is no right of

(13) Subsection (7) of this section shall apply in relation to a settlement subsisting on 6th April 1965 as follows—

(a) in the case of a settlement created on or after 6th April 1950, any period before 6th April 1965 shall be taken into account as it would if falling after that date, and

(6) in the case of a settlement created before 6th April 1950 the time taken into account for the purposes of the said subsection (7) shall begin with die fifteenth anniversary of the date of creation of the settlement (whether it is the first or any subsequent fifteenth anniversary) falling in the period of fifteen years from 6th April 1950 to 5th April 1965, but subsection (4) of this section shall not be applied by virtue of this subsection (taken together with subsection (7)) on a date falling before 7th April 1967.

26.—(1) In determining the value of an estate for the purposes of estate duty allowance shall be made for capital gains tax chargeable on chargeable gains accruing on the death in consequence of the provisions of section 24(1) (as well as of any amount of capital gains tax owed by the deceased).

(2) In estimating the principal value of any settled property passing on a death, whether it continues to be settled property or not, an allowance shall be made for any capital gains tax chargeable in consequence of the death in respect of the settled property, so far as that tax falls to be paid out of the property so passing or to be borne by any person to whom the property so passes for any beneficial interest in possession.

(3) Where the principal value of an asset passing on a death falls, for the purposes of estate duty leviable on the death, to be ascertained under section 7(5) of the Finance Act 1894 (under which the asset’s principal value is to be what it would have fetched if sold in the open market) and for the purposes of—

(a) a conclusive assessment to capital gains tax chargeable

in consequence of the death, or

(b) a conclusive decision on a claim for an allowable loss

accruing in consequence of the death,

the market value of the asset on the date of death has been fixed, the market value so fixed shall be taken to be the principal value of the asset for the purposes of the said section 7(5).

(4) Subsection <3) of this section shall not apply where the Part HI way in which Hie principal value of an asset is to be ascertained

under the said section 7(5) of the Finance Act 1894 is modified 1894 c. 30. by any provision in the enactments relating to estate duty which has no corresponding provision in this Part of this Act.

(5) If in an appeal against an assessment to capital gains tax chargeable in consequence of a death, or in an appeal against a decision on a claim for an allowable loss accruing in consequence of a death, the value fixed for the purposes of the assessment, or of the decision on the claim, as Hie market value of an asset on the date of the death is being or can be questioned, any person who would be enHHed to be a party to proceedings ques-tioning that market value in connection with estate duty on the death shall be enHHed to be a party to the appeal so far as the proceedings relate to that quesHon.

(6) For the purposes of this secHon an assessment to capital gains tax, and a decision on a claim for an allowable loss, is conclusive when it can no longer be varied either on appeal or by the decision of a court, but if, after it has become conclusive, an assessment to capital gains tax chargeable in consequence of the death is made which is based on a revision of the market value fixed by the assessment or decision which has become conclusive, subsecHon (3) of this secHon shall apply by reference to that revised market value, instead of the market value fixed by the assessment or decision which has become conclusive, unless, before the making of the second-menfioned assessment, a certificate has been issued under secHon 11 of the Finance Act 1894 discharging from any further claim for estate duty leviable on the death the asset in quesHon, or the Board are precluded for any other reason from re-opening the quesHon of the value for estate duty purposes of that asset.

(7) In this secHon references to an appeal against an assessment or against a decision on a claim include references to proceedings on a case stated by the Commissioners or other person hearing the appeal.

(8) In this secHon references to capital gains tax chargeable in consequence of a death are references to capital gains tax chargeable on gains—

(a) accruing on the disposal of assets deemed under this Part

(b) land which he has for his own occupation and enjoy-

ment with that residence as its garden or grounds up to an area (inclusive of the site of the dwelling-house) of one acre or such larger area as the Commissioners concerned may in any particular case determine, on being satisfied that, regard being had to the size and character of the dwelling-house, the larger area is required for the reasonable enjoyment of it (or of the part in question) as a residence.

In the case where part of the land occupied with a residence is and part is not within this subsection, then (up to the permitted area) that part shall be taken to be within this subsection which, if the remainder were separately occupied, would be the most suitable for occupation and enjoyment with the residence.

(2) The gain shall not be a chargeable gain if the dwelling-house or part of a dwelling-house has been the individual’s

(a) the individual may conclude that question by notice in

writing to the inspector given within two years from the beginning of that period, or given by the end of the year 1966-67, if that is later, but subject to a right to vary that notice by a further notice in writing to the inspector as respects any period beginning not earlier than two years before the giving of the further notice,

(b) subject to paragraph (a) above, the question shall be

concluded by the determination of the inspector, which may be as respects either the whole or specified parts of the period of ownership in question,

and notice of any determination of the inspector under paragraph (6) above shall be given to the individual who may appeal to the General Commissioners or the Special Commissioners against that determination within thirty days of service of the notice.

house) may qualify for relief as being the residence of a dependent relative of the claimant at any one time nor, in the case of a man and his wife living with him, as being the residence of a dependent relative of the claimant or of the claimant’s husband or wife at any one time, and

(b) the inspector, before allowing a claim may require the

claimant to show that the giving of the relief claimed will not under proviso (a) above preclude the giving of relief to the claimant’s wife or husband or that a claim to any such relief has been relinquished.

(12) Apportionments of consideration shall be made wherever required by this section and, in particular, where a person disposes of a dwelling-house only part of which is his only or main residence.

(13) In this section “ the period of ownership ”—

(a) where the individual has had different interests at dif-

ferent times shall be taken to begin from the first acquisition taken into account in arriving at the expenditure which under Schedule 6 to this Act is allowable as a deduction in computing under that Schedule the amount of the gain to which this section applies, and

(b) for the purposes of subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this

section, shall not include any period before 6th April 1965.

(2) The amount of tax (whether capital gains tax or corporation tax) chargeable in respect of a gain accruing on a disposal of an asset which is tangible movable property for a consideration the amount or value of which exceeds one thousand pounds shall not exceed half the difference between the amount of that consideration and one thousand pounds.

For the purposes of this subsection the capital gains tax or corporation tax chargeable in respect of the gain shall be the amount of tax which would not have been chargeable but for that gain.

(3) Subsections (1) and (2) above shall not affect the amount of an allowable loss accruing on the disposal of an asset, but for the purposes of computing under this Part of this Act the amount of a loss accruing on the disposal of tangible movable property the consideration for the disposal shall, if less than one thousand pounds, be deemed to be one thousand pounds and the losses which are allowable losses shall be restricted accordingly.

(5) If the disposal is of a right or interest in or over tangible movable property—

(a) in the first instance subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this

section shall be applied in relation to the asset as a whole, taking the consideration as including the market value of what remains undisposed of, in addition to the actual consideration,

(c) where that sum is less than one thousand pounds any

loss shall be restricted under subsection (3) of this section by deeming the consideration to be the actual consideration plus the said fraction of the difference between the said sum and one thousand pounds.

(2) A concession shall be given under this section in respect of the disposal of an asset on death if by virtue of section 40 of the Finance Act 1930 (which as amended by section 48 of the Finance Act 1950 exempts from estate duty objects of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest) the asset is exempt from estate duty chargeable by reference to that death, and a claim for exemption under that section may be made notwithstanding that, because the asset is exempt from estate duty or for any other reason, the allowance of the claim has no effect for the purposes of estate duty.

(3) A concession shall be given under this section in respect of the disposal of an asset which is an object to which the said section 40 applies, being—

(a) a disposal by way of gift, including a gift in settlement, or

(b) a disposal of settled property by the trustee on an occasion when, under section 25(3) or section 25(4) of this Act, the trustee is deemed to dispose and immediately re-acquire, settled property,

(4) The concession under subsection (2) or subsection (3) of this section shall be that both the person making the disposal and the person acquiring the asset on that disposal shall be treated for all the purposes of this Part of this Act as if the asset was acquired from the one making the disposal for a consideration of such amount as would secure that on the disposal neither a gain nor a loss would accrue to the one making the disposal.

(5) If there is a sale of the asset in relation to which section 40(2) of the Finance Act 1930 (under which the exemption is withdrawn if the exempted asset is sold otherwise than to certain national institutions or for certain other specified purposes) applies, or in relation to which it would have applied assuming that an undertaking given in respect of the asset under the said

section 48(1) or subsection (3) of this section had been given Part in for the purposes of relief from estate duty, as well as for the purposes of relief from tax on chargeable gains, or if the Treasury are satisfied that at any time during the period for which an undertaking under either enactment was given it has not been observed in a material respect, the person selling the asset or, as the case may be, the owner of the asset, shall be treated for the purposes of this Part of this Act as having sold the asset for a consideration equal to its market value, and in the case of a failure to comply with the undertaking, having immediately reacquired it for a consideration equal to its market value.

(6) A gain shall not be a chargeable gain if accruing on the

disposal of an asset by way of a sale to which the said section 40(2) would have applied (or would have applied on the assumptions in the last foregoing subsection), but for the proviso to that subsection, or but for express exception in any enactment amending the said section 40(2), including section 30(3) of the Finance Act 1953 and section 34(1) of the Finance Act 1956 1953 c. 34* (acceptance of objects in satisfaction of death duties). 1956 c. 54.

under section 48(1) of the Finance Act 1950 shall be for the 1950 c. 15. like period, and the reference in that subsection to the object’s being sold shall be construed accordingly; and if assets subject to any such undertaking under the said section 48(1) or subsection (3) of this section are disposed of (construing references to disposal as above) otherwise than on sale, and without any such undertaking being given in replacement, section 40(2) of the Finance Act 1930 and subsection (5) of this section shall 1930 c. 28. apply as if the assets had been then sold to an individual.

(8) If in pursuance of subsection (5) of this section a person is treated as having on any occasion sold an asset and estate duty becomes payable on the same occasion then in determining the value of the asset for the purposes of the estate duty allowance shall be made for the capital gains tax chargeable on any chargeable gain accruing on that occasion.

(9) This section, without subsection (8), shall apply in relation to estate duty leviable under the law of Northern Ireland as it applies in relation to estate duty leviable under the law of Great Britain with the substitution for the estate duty enactments mentioned in this section of the corresponding enactments forming part of the law of Northern Ireland, and subject to any other necessary modifications.

(a) as if the consideration for the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets were (if otherwise of a greater amount or value) of such amount as would secure that on the disposal neither a loss nor a gain accrues to him, and

(b) as if the amount or value of the consideration for the acquisition of, or of the interest in, the new assets were reduced by the excess of the amount or value of the actual consideration for the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets over the amount of the consideration which he is treated as receiving under paragraph (a) above,

(2) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply if part only of the amount or value of the consideration for the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets is applied as described in that subsection but if all of the amount or value of the consideration except for a part which is less than the amount of the gain (whether all chargeable gain or nob accruing on the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets is so applied, then the person carrying on the trade, on making a claim as respects the consideration which has been so applied, shall be treated for the purposes of this Part of this Act—

(a) as if the amount of the gain so accruing were reduced

to the amount of the said part (and, if not all chargeable gain, with a proportionate reduction in the amount of the chargeable gain), and

(b) as if the amount or value of the consideration for the

acquisition of, or of the interest in, the new assets were reduced by the amount by which the gain is reduced under paragraph (a) of this subsection,

Provided that, where an unconditional contract for the acquisition is so entered into, this section may be applied on a provisional basis without waiting to ascertain whether the new assets, or the interest in the new assets, is acquired in pursuance of the contract, and, when that fact is ascertained, all necessary adjustments shall be made by making assessments or by repayment or discharge of tax, and shall be so made notwithstanding any limitation in this Act on the time within which assessments may be made.

(5) This section shall not apply unless the acquisition of, or of the interest in, the new assets was made for the purpose of their use in the trade, and not wholly or partly for the purpose of realising a gain from the disposal of, or of the interest in, the new assets.

Part IV trading income from the trade in succeeding accounting periods;

and (so long as the company continues to carry on the trade) its trading income from the trade in any succeeding accounting period shall then be treated as reduced by the amount of the loss, or by so much of that amount as cannot, on that claim or on a claim (if made) under subsection (2) below, be relieved against income or profits of an earlier accounting period.

(2) Where in any accounting period a company carrying on a trade incurs a loss in the trade, then (subject to subsection (4) below) the company may claim to set the loss off for purposes of corporation tax against profits (of whatever description) of that accounting period and, if the company was then carrying on the trade and the claim so requires, of preceding accounting periods ending within the time specified in subsection (3) below; and, subject to that subsection and to any relief for an earlier loss, the profits of any of those periods shall then be treated as reduced by the amount of the loss, or by so much of that amount as cannot be relieved under this subsection against profits of a later accounting period.

(a) exceed the amount of the profits against which they

are deductible; and

(b) include payments made wholly and exclusively for the

purposes of a trade carried on by the company;

(2) Where a loss is incurred in an accounting period falling partly outside the twelve months mentioned in subsection (1) above, relief shall be given under that subsection in respect of a part only of that loss proportionate to the part of the period falling within those twelve months; and the amount of the reduction which may be made under that subsection in the trading income of an accounting period falling partly outside the three years there mentioned shall not exceed a part of that income proportionate to the part of the period falling within those three years.

(3) A claim for relief under this section may require that capital allowances in respect of the trade, being allowances which fall to be made to the company by way of discharge or repayment of tax and to be so made for an accounting period falling wholly or partly within the twelve months ending when the company ceases to carry on the trade, shall (so far as they cannot be otherwise taken into account so as to reduce or relieve any charge to corporation tax) be added to the loss incurred by the company in that accounting period or, if the company has not incurred a loss in the period, shall be treated as a loss so incurred:

(b) the trade is not, within the period taken for the comparison under paragraph (a) above, carried on otherwise than by a company which is within the charge to tax in respect of it;

(2) to (6) below.

In paragraphs (a) and (b)above references to the trade shall apply also to any other trade of which the activities comprise the activities of the first mentioned trade.

(2) The trade shall not be treated as permanentiy discontinued nor a new trade as set up and commenced for the purpose of the allowances and charges provided for by section 56 of this Act; but there shall be made to or on the successor in accordance with that section all such allowances and charges as would, if the predecessor had continued to carry on the trade, have fallen to be made to or on it, and the amount of any such allowance or charge shall be computed as if the successor had been caiTying on the trade since the predecessor began to do so and as if everything done to or by the predecessor had been done to or by the successor (but so that no sale or transfer which on the transfer of the trade is made to the successor by the predecessor of any assets in use for the purpose of the trade shall be treated as giving rise to any such allowance or charge).

(3) The predecessor shall not be entitled to relief under section 59 of this Act, except as provided by subsection (6) below; and, subject to any claim made by the predecessor under section 58(2) of this Act, the successor shall be entitled to relief under section 58(1), as for a loss sustained by the

successor in carrying on the trade, for any amount for which the predecessor would have been entitled to claim relief if it had continued to carry on the trade.

(4) Any securities (within the meaning of section 23 of the Finance Act 1959) which at the time when the predecessor ceases to carry on the trade form part of the trading stock belonging to the trade shall be treated for purposes of that section as having been sold at that time in the open market by the predecessor and as having been purchased at that time in the open market by the successor.

(5) For purposes of Schedule 8 to the Finance Act 1963 (transitional allowances for annual value of trade premises) any occupation of land for the purposes of the trade by the predecessor shall be treated as having been the occupation of the successor.

(6) On the successor ceasing to carry on the trade—

(a) if the successor does so within four years of succeeding to it, any relief which might be given to the successor under section 59 of this Act on its ceasing to carry on the trade may, so far as it cannot be given to the successor, be given to the predecessor as if the predecessor had incurred the loss (including any amount treated as a loss under section 59(3)); and

(b) if the successor ceases to cany on the trade within one year of succeeding to it, relief may be given to the predecessor under section 59 of this Act in respect of any loss incurred by it (or amount treated as such a loss under section 59(3));

but for the purposes of section 59 of this Act, as it applies by virtue of this subsection to the giving of relief to die predecessor, the predecessor shall be treated as ceasing to carry on the trade when the successor does so.

(7) Where the successor ceases to carry on the trade within the period taken for the comparison under subsection (l)(a) above and, on its doing so a third company begins to carry on the trade, then no relief shall be given to the predecessor by virtue of subsection (6) above by reference to that event, but subject to that subsections (2) to (6) above shall apply both in relation to that event (together with the new predecessor and successor) and to the earlier event (together with the original predecessor and successor), but so that—

(a) in relation to the earlier event “successor*’ shall in-

clude the successor at either event; and

(b) in relation to the later event “predecessor” shall in-

and if the conditions of this subsection are thereafter again Part IV satisfied, it shall apply again in like manner.

(8) Where, on a company ceasing to carry on a trade, another company begins to carry on the activities of the trade as part of its trade, then that part of the trade carried on by the successor shall be treated for the purposes of this section as a separate trade, if the effect of so treating it is that subsection (1) or (7) has effect on that event in relation to that separate trade; and where, on a company ceasing to cany on part of a trade, another company begins to carry on the activities of that part as its trade or part of its trade, the predecessor shall for purposes of this section be treated as having carried on that part of its trade as a separate trade if the effect of so treating it is that subsection

(1) or (7) above has effect on that event in relation to that separate trade.

Where under this subsection any activities of a company’s trade fall, on the company ceasing or beginning to carry them on, to be treated as a separate trade, the accounting periods of the company shall be adjusted accordingly, and any necessary apportionment shall be made of receipts, expenses, allowances or charges.

(9) Section 17(4) to (7) of the Finance Act 1954 (which state 1954 c. 44. the persons a trade is to be treated as belonging to) shall apply

for the purposes of this section, with the substitution for the reference in subsection (4)(c) to the conditions there mentioned being satisfied of a reference to subsection (1) or (7) of this section having effect in relation to an event; but that section (together with section 15 of the Finance Act 1964) shall cease i%4 c. 49. to have effect for any other purpose, except as respects any relevant change occurring before the year 1966-67.

(b) in a later year of assessment the distributions on which

the company pays the income tax under section 47(3) of this Act exceed its franked investment income;

(a) in relation to relief given in respect of management

expenses; and

(b) in relation to relief given in respect of capital allow-

ances;

as it applies in relation to relief given in respect of a loss (the reference to the company ceasing to be within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the trade being construed as a reference to its ceasing to be within that charge at all);

Provided that any amount which may be dealt with under subsection (5) as a loss shall be so dealt with rather than under this subsection, except in so far as the company concerned otherwise elects.

(7) Where a company has a surplus of franked investment income in any year of assessment, the company, instead of or in addition to making a claim under subsection (1) above, may claim that the surplus shall be taken into account for relief under section 58(1) or under section 59 of this Act, up to the amount of franked investment income for the year which, if chargeable to corporation tax, would have been so taken into account by virtue of section 58(7); and where the company makes a claim under this subsection, then (subject to the restriction to the said amount of franked investment income)—

(b) if the claim relates to section 59, subsections (3) and

(4) of this section shall apply in relation to it, with the like substitution in subsection (3) and with the substitution in subsection (4) of a reference to section 59(1) for the reference to section 56(6) or 58(2) and of a reference to section 59(2) for the reference to section 56(7) or 58(3).

(5) If the recipient is entitled (for himself or for any trust or fund) to claim exemption in any respect from income tax, the exemption shall not extend to tax on the relevant distribution, but the relevant distribution and any income tax deducted or treated under this Part of this Act as deducted from it shall be disregarded in determining whether any payment made by the recipient is to be treated as made out of profits or gains brought into charge to income tax.

(6) If the recipient is a company, any election made under section 48(3) of this Act shall not apply to the relevant distribution.

(7) Subsection (l)(c) above shall not apply to a distribution

(ii) in applying that paragraph in any other case there shall be taken and made such averages and adjustments as appear to be necessary for a fair comparison, including adjustments to take account of new issues affecting the proportion of the company’s capital represented by the holding and of distribution made on holdings formerly representing the same capital or part of it.

(9) Where the application of subsection (l)(c) above to a distribution is excluded by subsection (8) above, then section 24(1) or 26(1) of the Finance Act 1959 (which relate to certain purchases and sales of securities) shall also not apply to it; but where in a case falling within section 23 of that Act the first buyer is a company, and is not a dealer, subsection (3) above shall apply in relation to the appropriate amount in respect of the interest as determined in accordance with Schedule 6 to that Act as it is expressed to apply in relation to a relevant distribution, and shall so apply in relation to securities and interest within the meaning of the said section 23, whatever their nature.

(c) in relation to Northern Ireland, the council of any county, county or other borough, or urban or rural district, any other body of which all or substantially all the members are elected by local government electors and which is established for public local purposes and has power to raise money for those purposes by rates leviable on the basis of assessments in respect of land, and any committee or board appointed wholly or partly by a county or district council or by several such councils jointly.

(3) In subsection (2 )(a)and (b) above any reference to a joint board or joint committee of such authorities as are there mentioned applies, and applies only, to a joint board or joint committee of which all the constituent members are such authorities or which, having such authorities and other bodies corporate as its constituent members, is authorised by or under any enactment to require from those authorities, but not from other constituent members, the payment of sums to meet or towards meeting the amount or estimated amount by which its revenue for any period falls short or may fall short of its expenditure for that period; and for this purpose, if a member of a joint board or joint committee is a representative of or appointed by any authority or body, that authority or body (and not he) is to be treated as a constituent member of the board or committee.

1960 c. 44. in section 71(1), in the definition of “ authorised unit trust scheme ”, for the words “ or chargeable accounting period (for profits tax purposes) ” there were substituted the words “ or accounting period (for corporation tax purposes) ”, and references in this Part of this Act to a body corporate shall be construed accordingly; but—

(a) the first reference to income in section 69(1) shall include chargeable gains; and

(b) for the references in section 69(2) to sections 425 and 1952 c. 10. 184(1) of the Income Tax Act 1952 there shall be

substituted respectively references to section 57 and to section 47(4) of this Act.

(2) Where in an accounting period of a unit trust the aggregate of the capital sums paid in respect of the cancellation of units exceeds the aggregate of the capital sums received in respect of the creation of units, then the amount (as computed apart from this provision) of any chargeable gain or allowable loss accruing to the unit trust in that period shall be taken as reduced by the appropriate fraction of it, that is to say, by die same fraction as the said excess is of the total net consideration received by the unit trust on the disposal of chargeable assets during the period after deduction of the incidental costs of making the disposal (or, if the said excess is greater than the said total net consideration, shall be taken to be nil).

(3) For purposes of section 37 of this Act the total net gains of a unit trust for an accounting period are the excess, if any, of the chargeable gains accruing to the unit trust in the period over the allowable losses deductible from those gains (as those gains and losses are computed for the charge to tax on the unit trust), after deduction from that excess of the tax which will be charged on the unit trust for the period in respect of chargeable gains, and the proportion attributable to any unit holder of the total net gains for any accounting period shall be determined by the unit trust, regard being among other things had, as between units of different classes, to the proportion of the assets of the unit trust representing gains on capital which would be attributable to the respective classes in a liquidation of the unit trust; and no apportionment which the unit trust makes under this section shall be questionable in any proceedings by the unit holders or by any other person.

(4) After carrying out an apportionment under subsection

(3) of this section the unit trust shall give any unit holder to

(a) the total net gains (employing that term) of the unit

trust for the accounting period, so far as known; and

(b) the amount apportioned to him;

and the unit holders between whom the total net gains are to be apportioned shall (except on an apportionment made in accordance with subsection (5) below) be determined by reference to the same date as the right to payment of the first dividend after the end of the accounting period, and that date shall be deemed to be the date when the apportionment is made and shall be specified in the notice.

(5) The apportionment under subsection (3) of this section shall be carried out separately for each accounting period but a notice may be issued in respect of part of an accounting period apportioned in the light of the information available at the time, and an apportionment (or final apportionment) for an accounting period may be made at or after the end of the period, notwithstanding that any amounts are not finally ascertained; but if at any time it is found that too much or too little has been apportioned it shall be corrected as soon as may be by deduction from or addition to the total net gains of a later accounting period or periods.

(6) A notice under subsection (4) of this section may be combined with the statement in writing required to be given under section 199 of the Income Tax Act 1952 (statements in dividend 1952 c. 10, warrants, etc.).

(7) Before the notices under subsection (4) of this section are sent out, particulars of the apportionments shall be submitted to the inspector, and the notices shall not be sent out without his approval, but subject to a right of appeal to the General Commissioners having jurisdiction in any assessment on the unit trust, being a right of appeal against the refusal of the inspector to give his approval.

In the application of this subsection to Northern Ireland for the reference to the General Commissioners there shall be substituted a reference to the Special Commissioners.

(8) Anything required by subsections (3) to (7) above to be done by a unit trust shall be done by the managers of the unit trust with the approval of the trustee.

(9) Subsections (3) to (7) above shall apply in relation to an investment trust as they apply in relation to a unit trust with the necessary adaptations of references to units and unit holders; and for this purpose “investment trust” has the meaning assigned to it by section 37 of this Act.

69.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section and of section 426(1) of the Income Tax Act 1952 (under which life assurance business is to be treated as a separate business), section 57 of this Act shall apply for computing the profits of a company carrying on life assurance business, whether mutual or proprietary, (and not charged to corporation tax in respect of it under Case I of Schedule D), whether or not the company is resident in the United Kingdom, as that section applies in relation to an investment company, except that—

(a) there shall be deducted from the amount treated as

expenses of management for any accounting period the amount of any fines, fees or profits arising from reversions; and

(b) no deduction shall be made under proviso (a) to section 57(1) in respect of income derived from sources not charged to tax, but proviso ( shall include enactments applying to companies carrying on life assurance business though not to investment companies.

(a) if the amount on which the company would be so charged under Case I of Schedule D exceeds those profits (before any such deduction) an amount equal to that excess shall be deducted from the amount of franked investment income that may be treated as profits of the period chargeable to corporation tax for purposes of a claim under section 62 of this Act; and

(a) the exclusion from the charge to corporation tax of the

distributions of companies resident in the United Kingdom shall not prevent franked investment income of a company so resident from being taken into account as part of the profits in computing trading income in accordance with the rules applicable to Case I of Schedule D, and in ascertaining for purposes of section 58 or 59 of this Act whether and to what extent a company has incurred a loss on its life assurance business any profits derived from the investments of its life assurance fund (including franked investment income of a company so resident) shall be treated as part of the profits of that business;

(b) in the case of a company carrying on general annuity

business, the annuities paid by the company, so far as referable to that business and so far as they do not exceed the income charged to corporation tax and franked investment income of the part of the annuity fund so referable, shall be treated as charges on income, but section 60 of this Act shall not be taken to apply to a loss incurred by a company on its pension annuity business or its general annuity business;

(4) Where by virtue of section 429 of the Income Tax Act 1952 corporation tax is payable by reference to the amount of income received in the United Kingdom, and under section 347 or 348 credit for any tax falls to be allowed in respect of that income, the amount received shall be treated as increased by an amount equal to the tax which falls to be taken into account in determining whether any, and if so what, credit is to be allowed against corporation tax (including in the case of a dividend any such tax not charged directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend, but excluding tax not payable but falling to be taken into account by virtue of section 17 of the Finance Act 1961 (foreign tax reliefs to promote development)).

(6) Section 427(2) of the Income Tax Act 1952 (which provides for repayment of income tax on income reserved for policy holders where the standard rate exceeds seven shillings and sixpence in the pound) shall apply to chargeable gains as it applies to income, applying—

(a) to franked investment income as if income tax deducted

or treated under this Part of this Act as deducted from it were income tax borne by the company; and

(b) to income chargeable to corporation tax and to chaige-

able gains as if references to the standard rate of income tax were references to the rate of corporation tax.

(a) it is referable in accordance with section 24 of the 1956 c. 54.

Finance Act 1956 to pension annuity business; or

(b) being referable to general annuity business, it does not

have to be taken into account to enable annuities referable to that business to be treated as charges on income.

Any franked investment income on which income tax is repayable as mentioned in this subsection, or which is taken into account as mentioned in paragraph (b), shall be left out of account under section 48 of this Act

(8) Where—

(a) a company carrying on life assurance business has before the date of the passing of this Act issued policies of life assurance—

(i) providing for benefits which consist to any extent of investments of a specified description or of a sum of money to be determined by reference to the value of such investments; but

(ii) not providing for the deduction from those benefits of any amount by reference to tax chargeable in respect of chargeable gains; and

(b) the investments of the company’s life assurance fund,

so far as referable to those policies, consist wholly or mainly of investments of the description so specified; and

(c) on the company becoming liable under any of those

policies for any such benefits (including benefits to be provided on the surrender of a policy), a chargeable gain accrues to the company from the disposal in meeting or for the purpose of meeting that liability of investments of that description forming part of its life assurance fund, or would so accrue if the liability were met by or from the proceeds of such a disposal;

then the company shall be entitled as against the person receiving the benefits to retain out of them a part of them not exceeding in amount or value corporation tax in respect of the gain referred to at (c) above, computed without regard to any amount retained under this provision, and computed at the rate of corporation tax for the time being in force or, if no

(3) If for any accounting period of a registered industrial Part IV and provident society a return under section 442(4) of the Income Tax Act 1952 is not duly made, share interest and loan 1952 c. 10. interest paid by the society in that period shall not be deductible

in computing income for purposes of corporation tax or be treated as a charge on income.

(4) As regards share interest and loan interest paid before the year 1966-67 subsection (3) above shall apply to the returns required by section 443(4) of the Income Tax Act 1952; but subsection (l)(h) above shall not apply to share interest or loan interest so paid, except in so far as relief cannot be given in respect of it under section 443(l)(a) of that Act.

(5) Any claim made by a housing association under section

43 of the Finance Act 1963 after the year 1965-66 shall be made 1963 c. 25. as theretofore for a year of assessment or part of a year of assessment.

(6) A housing association within the meaning of the said section 43 shall be exempt from corporation tax in respect of chargeable gains accruing to it on the disposal by way of sale of any property which has been or is being occupied by a tenant of the housing association;

Provided that this subsection shall not apply to an association except on a claim made on that behalf for an accounting period or part thereof during which it was approved for the purposes of the said section 43, and Schedule 10 to the Finance Act 1963 shall have effect in relation to any such claim, with any necessary adaptations, as it has effect in relation to a claim under that section.

(8) Where in accordance with a scheme approved under section

5 of the Housing Act 1964 the Housing Corporation acquires 1964 c. 56. from a housing society the society’s interest in all the land held by the society for carrying out its objects, or where after the Housing Corporation has so acquired from a housing society all the land so held by it the Corporation disposes to a single housing society of the whole of that land (except any part previously disposed of or agreed to be disposed of otherwise than to a housing society), together with all related assets, then both parties

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

In this subsection “ housing society ” has the same meaning as in Part I of the Housing Act 1964, and “ related assets ” means in relation to an acquisition of land by the Housing Corporation assets acquired by the Corporation in accordance with the same scheme as that land, and in relation to a disposal of land by the Housing Corporation assets held by the Corporation for purposes of the same scheme as that land.

(9) Subsections (1) and (7) of this section shall have effect as if references to a registered industrial and provident society included any co-operative association established and resident in the United Kingdom, and having as its object or primary object to assist its members in the carrying on of agricultural or horticultural businesses on land occupied by them in the United Kingdom or in the carrying on of businesses consisting in the catching or taking of fish or shellfish.

71.—(1) As respects the year 1966-67 and later years of assessment section 445 of the Income Tax Act 1952 (under which a building society may make and receive interest payments without deduction of income tax under arrangements for it to be specially assessed under Schedule D) shall have effect notwithstanding the provisions of this Part of this Act requiring income tax to be deducted from distributions; and—

(a) in section 445(1) there shall be substituted for paragraph (a)—

“ (a) on such sums as may be determined in

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

507

accordance with the arrangements the society is Part IV liable to account for and pay an amount representing income tax calculated in part at the standard rate and in part at a reduced rate which takes into account the operation of the subsequent provisions of this section;”

and accordingly in the proviso, immediately before the words “ the total tax ”, there shall be inserted the words “ (if the amount so payable by the society under the arrangements is regarded as income tax for the year of assessment) ”;

(b) section 445(3)(b) shall not apply to interest paid by a company not resident in the United Kingdom under a liability incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of a trade carried on by it in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency.

enters into arrangements under section 445 of the Income 1952 c. 10. Tax Act 1952, dividends or interest payable in respect of shares in, or deposits with or loans to, the society shall be dealt with for the purposes of corporation tax as follows:—

(a) in computing for any accounting period ending in the

year of assessment the total profits of the society there shall be allowed as a deduction the actual amount paid or credited in the accounting period of any such dividends or interest, together with the amount accounted for and paid by the society in respect thereof as representing income tax;

(b) in computing the income of a company which is paid

or credited in the year of assessment with any such dividends or interest, the company shall be treated as having received an amount which, after deduction of income tax at the standard rate for the year of assessment, is equal to the amount paid or credited, and shall be entitled to a set off or repayment of income tax accordingly, except that the dividends or interest shall not be brought into account under Schedule 12 to this Act;

(c) no part of any such dividends or interest paid or cre-

dited in the year of assessment shall be treated as a distribution of the society or as franked investment income of any company resident in the United Kingdom.

(3) Where for the year 1965-66 a building society enters into arrangements under section 445 of the Income Tax Act 1952—

508

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

Part IV

(a) if a society which but for the arrangements would be

assessed to income tax for the year 1965-66 by reference to a period ending before that year is under the arrangements (and without any election thereunder by the society) so assessed by reference to a period ending in that year, then subsection (4) below shall apply to the society in place of the general provisions of this Part of this Act as to the time for payment of corporation tax; and

(b) subsection (2) (a) above shall have effect in relation to

any accounting period of the society ending in that year with the substitution for the reference to the amount accounted for and paid by the society in respect of the dividends and interest as representing income tax of a reference to the amount computed by reference to the dividends or interest in accordance with the provision made by those arrangements with reference to dividends and interest for charging the society to income tax for that year.

(4) Where this subsection applies to a building society, then—

(a) corporation tax assessed on the society for any account-

ing period shall be paid within one month from the making of the assessment, except that if the society’s basis period for the year 1965-66 does not extend into the year 1966, the tax shall not be payable before the like time after the last day of the accounting period as 1st January 1966 is after the last day of that basis period; but

(b) if corporation tax has not become payable by the society

for an accounting period by the like time from the beginning of that period as there is between the beginning of the said basis period and 1st January 1966, the society shall at that time from the beginning of the accounting period make a provisional payment of tax computed on the amount on which the society is chargeable to corporation tax for the accounting period last ended (or, as the case may be, is chargeable to income tax by reference to the said basis period), with such adjustments, if any, as may be required for periods of different length or as may be agreed between the society and the inspector.

References in this subsection to a society’s basis period for the year 1965-66 are references to the period by reference to which the society is assessed to income tax for that year under the arrangements referred to in subsection (3) above.

(5) If in the course of, or as part of, a union or amalgamation of two or more building societies, or a transfer of engagements

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

509

from one building society to another, there is a disposal of an asset by one society to another, both shall be treated for purposes of corporation tax in respect of chargeable gains as if the asset were acquired from the one making the disposal for a consideration of such amount as would secure that on the disposal neither a gain nor a loss would accrue to the one making the disposal.

(2) In the case of a company carrying on any mutual life assurance business, the provisions of this Act relating to distributions shall not apply to distributions made to persons participating in the mutual activities of that business and derived from those activities; but if the business includes annuity business, the annuities payable in the course of that business shall not be treated as charges on the income of the company to any greater extent than if the business were not mutual but were being carried on by the company with a view to the realisation of profits for the company.

(3) Subject to the foregoing subsections, the fact that a distribution made by a company carrying on any such business is derived from die mutual activities of that business and the recipient is a person participating in those activities shall not affect the character which the payment or other receipt has for purposes of corporation tax or income tax in the hands of the recipient

(4) Where a company does not and never has carried on a trade or a business of holding investments, and is not established for purposes which include the carrying on of a trade or of such a business, the provisions of this Part of this Act relating to distributions shall apply to distributions made by the company only to the extent to which the distributions are made out of profits of the company which are brought into charge to corporation tax or out of franked investment income.

(2) A company's share in the profits or loss of any accounting period or in any matter excluded from the computation by proviso (b) to subsection (1) above shall be determined according to the interests of the partners during that period and corporation tax shall be chargeable as if that share derived from a trade carried on by it alone, and the company shall be assessed and charged to tax accordingly:

Provided that for purposes of any relief from tax which may be given against total profits a company may claim that any profits in respect of which it is chargeable in accordance with this section and, so far as it cannot be relieved against those profits, any matter for which relief may be given against diem in accordance with this section shall be dealt with as if they derived from a separate trade carried on by it otherwise than in partnership (any necessary apportionment being made where accounting periods of the company do not coincide with those of the partnership).

(3) Where any of the persons engaged in carrying on the trade is an individual, income tax shall be chargeable in respect of his share of the profits, and he shall be entitied to relief for his share of any loss, as if all the partners had been individuals, except that—

(a) income tax shall be chargeable and any relief from income tax shall be given by reference to the computations made for corporation tax, but so that the amounts so computed for an accounting period of the capital allowances and charges falling to be made in taxing the trade shall (as regards the individual’s share of them) be given or made for the year or years

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

Provided that for any accounting period for which the company so elects this subsection shall apply with the substitution for the reference to fifteen per cent, of the company's profits for that period of a reference to fifteen per cent of the profits of a period of the same length, computed as aforesaid but according to the average of the three years preceding the accounting period, or of such part (not being less than twelve months) of those three years as falls after the company commenced to carry on business or became resident in the United Kingdom, so, however, that in arriving at the average for a period beginning before the year 1966-67 there shall be brought into the computation profits arising from the company’s trade or business which are chargeable to profits tax, computed as for that tax, together with any such franked investment income (within the meaning of that tax) as would not, if received in like circumstances after the year 1965-66, be treated as coming from within the company's group.

For this purpose distributions received by the company from another are to be treated as coming from within the company's group if but only if dividends so received are group income or would be group income if the companies so elected, and, where the proviso to this subsection has effect, the amount of the profits of the three years there mentioned or the relevant part of those three years shall, if the case requires, be arrived at by division and apportionment or aggregation of profits or losses for periods of account wholly or partly comprised therein.

(2) Subsection (1) above shall not reduce the deduction for any accounting period below £4,000 nor, if there are for more than half the accounting period at least two directors to whom subsection (3) below applies, below the aggregate remuneration, within the limits permitted by subsection (3), of those directors.

(3) This subsection applies to directors who are required to devote substantially the whole of their time to the service of the company in a managerial or technical capacity but are not wholetime service directors, and the limits on the deduction permitted by reference to their remuneration are as follows: —

half or more of the accounting period there are less than four such directors, and to £7,000 if for half or more of it there are less than three; and

(b) a limit of £4,000 on the remuneration of the highest

paid such director and £3,000 on that of any other, except that if the remuneration of the highest paid such director is less than £4,000, an amount equal to the difference may be made up on the remuneration of the others.

“ The highest paid such director ”, if no one such director is Part IV the highest paid, means one such director having remuneration as high as that of any of the others.

(4) In relation to an accounting period of less than twelve months each of the sums of money numerically specified in subsections (2) and (3) shall be proportionately reduced.

(5) Where a company is a close company for part only of an accounting period and the deduction which would otherwise be allowable for that period for directors’ remuneration is decreased under this section, the decrease shall be such part of that which would be made apart from this subsection as is proportionate to that part of the period.

(6) This section shall apply in relation to a company having more than one source of income so as to restrict the aggregate deductions to be made in any manner for the remuneration of directors, including deductions giving rise to or augmenting a loss.

(2) Where, after a company has paid the amount assessed on it under subsection (1) above in respect of any loan or advance*, the loan or advance or any part of it is repaid to the company, the amount paid by the company or a proportionate part of it shall be repaid.

(3) Where a company is assessed or liable to be assessed under this section in respect of a loan or advance, and releases or writes off the whole or part of the debt in respect of it, the person to whom it was made shall be treated for purposes of surtax as having then received an amount of income equal to the grossed up equivalent of the amount so released or written off:

Provided that if the loan or advance was made to a person who has since died, or to trustees of a trust which has come to an end, this subsection instead of applying to the person to whom it was made shall apply to the person from whom the debt is due at the time of the release or writing off (and if it is due from him as personal representative within the meaning of Part XIX of the Income Tax Act 1952, the amount treated as c. 10.

received by him shall accordingly be, as regards surtax, included for purposes of the said Part XIX in the aggregate income of the estate).

(4) For purposes of this section the grossed up equivalent of an amount is such sum as after deduction of income tax at the standard rate is equal to that amount, and shall be computed by reference to the standard rate for the year of assessment in which the loan or advance is made or, as the case may be, the debt is wholly or partly released or written off.

(5) Subsection (3) of this section shall not have effect in relation to a loan or advance made to a person if any sum falls in respect of the loan or advance to be included in his income by virtue of section 408 of the Income Tax 1952, except in so far as the amount released or written off exceeds the sums previously falling to be so included (without the addition for income tax provided for by section 408(4)); and where any amount is included in a person’s income by virtue of subsection (3) above in respect of any loan or advance, there shall be a corresponding reduction in the amount (if any) afterwards falling to be so included in respect of it by virtue of the said section 408.

(6) Where under arrangements made by any person otherwise than in the ordinary course of a business carried on by him—

(a) a close company makes a loan or advance to a person

who is not a participator in the company or an associate of a participator; and

(b) some person other than the close company makes a payment or transfers property to, or releases or satisfies (in whole or in part) a liability of, an individual who is a participator in the company or an associate of a participator;

then, unless in respect of the matter referred to at (b) above there falls to be included in the total income for purposes of surtax of the participator or associate an amount not less than the grossed up equivalent of the loan or advance, this section shall apply as if the loan or advance had been made to him.

(7) In subsections (1) and (6)(b) above the references to an individual shall apply also to a company receiving the loan or advance in a fiduciary or representative capacity and to a company not resident in the United Kingdom.

76.—(1) Where, in respect of any payment made or consideration given by a company after the year 1965-66, any sum falls by virtue of section 242 of the Income Tax Act 1952 (charge of surtax on consideration for certain restrictive covenants etc.) to be included in an individual’s total income for purposes of

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

515

surtax, and at the time when the payment is made or the Part IV consideration is given the company is a close company and the individual is a participator in the company or an associate of a participator, there shall be assessed on and recoverable from the company, as if it were an amount of income tax chargeable on the company, an amount equal to income tax on the sum falling to be included in the individual's income as aforesaid, at the standard rate for the year of assessment in which the payment is made or consideration is given.

(2) Where subsection (1) above would apply to any payment or consideration if the condition that the company is a close company and the individual a participator in it or an associate of a participator were satisfied at the time when the payment is made or die consideration is given, the subsection shall apply if either—

(a) at that time the individual holds or is about to hold an

office or employment with the company and the condition is satisfied within two years afterwards; or

(b) at that time the individual holds or has held an office

or employment with the company and the condition has been satisfied within two years previously.

77.—(1) If in any accounting period of a close company Shortfall in there is a shortfall in the company's distributions, there shall distributions be assessed on and recoverable from the company, as if it were an amount of income tax chargeable on the company, an amount j^come tax equal to the income tax for which the company would be liable at standard to account under section 47(3) of this Act on a distribution rate), equal in amount (before deduction of income tax) to the shortfall and made twelve months after the end of the accounting period (income tax having been deducted).

(2) For the purposes of this section the shortfall in a company's distributions for any accounting period is, save as otherwise provided by this section, the amount (if any) by which the distributions for the period fall short of the required standard; and the required standard is the distributable income for the period, less so much of that income (not exceeding, in the case of a company which is neither a trading company nor a member of a trading group, the amount of the estate or trading income) as the company shows could not be distributed without prejudice to the requirements of the company’s business:

Provided that the required standard shall in no case exceed the company’s distributable investment income for the period plus sixty per cent, of the estate or trading income of the period, and for the purpose of this proviso in its application to a trading company not having any associated company the estate or

1952 c. 10.

trading income for the period, if it is less than £9,000, shall be treated as reduced by one-fifth of the amount required to make it up to £9,000 or, if it is less than £1,500, shall be disregarded.

(3) In arriving at the required standard for any accounting period—

(a) regard shall be had not only to the current requirements

of the company’s business but also to such other requirements as may be necessary or advisable for the maintenance and development of that business, but for this purpose sections 246(2) and (3) and 258(1) and

(4) of the Income Tax Act 1952, except section 246(2) proviso, shall apply as they applied for the corresponding purpose of section 245;

(b) the amount of the estate or trading income shall be

taken at the amount included in respect of it in the distributable income;

(c) for an accounting period of less than twelve months the

sums of £9,000 and £1,500 specified in the proviso to subsection (2) above shall be proportionately reduced;

(d) if the company is a trading company and for part of

the period has, and for part of the period has not, got an associated company, the required standard shall be arrived at by aggregating the amounts for those parts separately computed as if they were distinct accounting periods.

(4) Where a company is subject to any restriction imposed by law as regards the making of distributions, any shortfall in its distributions for an accounting period shall be disregarded to the extent to which the company could not make distributions up to the required standard without contravening that restriction.

(5) Where a company is in respect of any year of assessment assessed under this section in respect of a shortfall in distributions, and there is in that year a surplus of franked investment income (including any amount carried forward from an earlier year), the company may claim that the shortfall shall be set off as far as may be against that surplus, and each of them shall then (as regards the company) be treated as reduced by the amount of the set-off.

Effect shall be given to a claim under this subsection in priority to any claim for the same year under section 62 of this Act, but the set-off shall be made as far as may be against any part of the surplus which has been carried forward from an earlier year of assessment.

(6) Where a company is assessed under this section in respect of a shortfall in distributions for any accounting period, then (so long as the company remains a close company) it may

Ch. 25

517

for any later accounting period for which there is no such short- Part IV fall claim that the shortfall of the earlier period, or so much of it as has not been dealt with under this subsection, shall, in determining the income tax payable by the company in respect of distributions for the later period or, as the case may be, in arriving at any surplus of franked investment income, be deducted rateably from the distributions made by the company for the later period:

Provided that no deduction shall be made under this subsection from the distributions for any accounting period so as to reduce those distributions below the required standard or below the amount of the directors’ remuneration included in the distributions in computing them for purposes of this section.

78.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the income Apportion-of a close company for any accounting period may for purposes ment for of surtax be apportioned by the Board among the participators,8urtax of,cIosc and any amount apportioned to a close company (whether 8

originally or by one or more sub-apportionments under this provision) may be further apportioned among the participators in that company; and on any such apportionment section 249 of the Income Tax Act 1952, as adapted by this section, shall 1952 c. 10. apply as it applied on an apportionment of a company’s income under Chapter III of Part IX of that Act.

(2) For purposes of an apportionment under this section, there shall be added to the amount of income to be apportioned any amounts which were deducted in respect of annual payments in arriving at the company’s distributable income for the accounting period and which in the case of an individual would not have been deductible or would have been treated as his income in computing his total income for surtax.

(3) Except in the case of a trading company, there may be apportioned under this section, if the Board see reason for it, the whole of a company’s income for an accounting period up to the amount of the required standard (notwithstanding that there has been no shortfall in distributions for that period), together with any addition to be made under subsection (2) above but with such reduction, if any, as may be just in respect of distributions made for the period to persons other than participators and associates of participators (or amounts treated as such for purposes of section 77 above):

Provided that for this purpose the required standard shall be treated as reduced by so much of any shortfall in the distributions for the period as would under section 77(4) above be disregarded in an assessment made in respect of that shortfall.

(4) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) above, an apportionment shall not be made under this section of a company’s income for an accounting period unless an assessment is made

on the company under section 77 of this Act in respect of a shortfall in its distributions for that period, and the amount apportioned shall be the amount of that assessment

(5) Any apportionment made under this section, including any sub-apportionment of an amount directly or indirectly apportioned to a company, shall be made according to the respective interests in the company in question of the participators, except that—

(a) in the case of any company, the provisos to section 258(3) of the Income Tax Act 1952 and section 259(1) of that Act (which enable regard to be had to beneficial interests in loans, or to the interests which would arise in a winding up) shall apply as they applied in the case of an investment company to apportionments under Chapter III of Part IX of that Act (a reference to a participator being substituted for any reference to a member or to a loan creditor); and

(b) if the company is not a trading company, section 260 of that Act (which gave further powers to have regard to underlying interests) except subsection (5) shall also apply in like manner.

(6) Where an apportionment is made by virtue of subsection

(3) above, an individual shall not be charged to surtax on an amount treated in consequence of the apportionment or any sub-apportionment as being his income except in so far as it exceeds the amount which, apart from the apportionment, falls in respect of distributions made by the company in the accounting period to be included in the statement of total income to be made by him for purposes of surtax; and no individual shall be charged to surtax by virtue of any apportionment under this section unless the sum or (where there is a sub-apportionment) aggregate sum on which he is so chargeable amounts either to £100 or more or to five per cent, or more of the amount apportioned.

(7) Subject to subsection (6) above, on an apportionment under this section, section 249 of the Income Tax Act 1952 shall apply subject to the following modifications: —

(a) for any reference to a member there shall be substituted

a reference to a participator;

(b) subsection (2)(c) shall not apply, and any amount

treated under the section as a person’s income for purposes of surtax shall be deemed for those purposes to have been received by him at the end of the accounting period to which the apportionment relates; and

(c) there shall not be deducted from the amount appor-

tioned to any person (whether on the original

The provisions of Schedule 18 to this Act shall have Supplementary effect for the interpretation and operation of the foregoing provisions sections of this Act relating to close companies, for their modification in certain cases and for other purposes there dealt00 p with; and those sections shall have effect subject to and in accordance with the provisions of that Schedule.

Where this subsection applies to a company having distinct trades with different basis periods, that one of the basis periods which ends soonest shall be taken.

(4) In this section any reference to the basis period for the year 1964-65 or 1965-66 is, in relation to any source of income, a reference to the period on the income of which the income tax (if any) chargeable for that year falls to be finally computed in respect of the source or, where by virtue of any provision of the Income Tax Acts the income of any other period is to be taken to be the income of the said period, that other period.

(5) Where a company is within the charge to income tax in respect of a trade at the end of the year 1965-66, and continues to carry on the trade after the end of that year, section 54(2) of this Act shall not apply to treat the trade as permanently discontinued and a new trade as set up and commenced on the company first coming within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the trade.

(6) Where in the case of a trade carried on by a company the year 1965-66 is the second year of assessment within the meaning of section 129 of the Income Tax Act 1952 (period of computation of profits for second and third years of trade), the company may at any time within the following six years give or revoke the like notice under that section for that year as, but for this Part of this Act, could be given for that and the succeeding year.

(9) Where subsections (1), (2) and (7) above would operate differently for different parts of a source of income (not being a trade) if those parts were treated as separate sources for the purposes of those subsections, they shall be so treated.

81.—(1) Subject to subsection (4) below, there shall be dis- Winding up regarded for the purposes of the profits tax for any chargeable of the accounting period profits in respect of which a body corporate,profits tax* society or other body is within the charge to corporation tax, and all amounts which would be deductible in computing any such profits for profits tax purposes (in so far as they are also deductible in computing other profits for those purposes) and which are deductible for corporation tax, except that—

(a) if that body or society is within the charge to corpora-

tion tax in respect of the profits for part only of the chargeable accounting period, this subsection shall apply in relation to that part, and there shall be made the like apportionments between that part and the remainder, as if the two parts were separate chargeable accounting periods; and

(b) in the case of a close company, a deduction may be

made in respect of the remuneration of directors other than whole-time service directors, so long as the deduction, when added to the amount of any deduction that may be made for corporation tax (or such part of any such deduction as is apportionable to the chargeable accounting period), does not exceed the deduction which would have been permitted under paragraph 11 of Schedule 4 to the Finance Act 1937 1937 c. 54. if this subsection had not had effect.

(2) Subject to subsection (4) below, where a body or society is within the charge to corporation tax in respect of a trade for periods comprising the whole or part of the year 1964-65 or 1965-66, then in respect of allowances and charges made for purposes of income tax in charging the profits or gains of the trade for that year no deduction or addition shall be made under paragraph 1 or 2 (capital allowances) of Part I of Schedule 8 to the Finance Act 1947 for purposes of the profits tax for any 1947 c. 35. accounting period falling wholly or partly within the said periods, except such deduction or addition, if any, as would be made for any part of that accounting period falling outside the said periods if that part were a separate accounting period.

(2) Income tax shall not be charged by virtue of section 10 or section 14 of the Finance Act 1962 (short-term gains) in respect of an acquisition and disposal of any chargeable assets by a company or by a local authority (as defined in section 66 of this Act) or a local authority association (as so defined), and section 10(7) (profits tax on short-term gains) shall cease to have effect; and accordingly sections 10 and 14 shall not apply for corporation tax.

This subsection has effect—

(a) in relation to an acquisition or disposal if either the acquisition or the disposal, whichever is the earlier, occurs on or before 6th April 1965 but the disposal or acquisition, whichever is the later, occurs after 6th April 1965; and

(3) In the case of a gain of any amount accruing to a company on an acquisition and disposal within subsection (2 above, die gain shall be treated for purposes of subsection (1) above or, as the case may be, of corporation tax as if it were a chargeable gain, and any loss so accruing shall be brought into account accordingly; and for those purposes the question whether any and, if so what, gain or loss so accrues shall accordingly be determined in accordance with the provisions applicable to income tax chargeable under Case VII of Schedule D and not in accordance with the provisions of Part III of this Act.

(4) Any losses which are allowable against chargeable gains under subsection (1) above or would be so allowable but for the company being within the charge to corporation tax from the beginning of the year 1965-66, in so far as they cannot be allowed against chargeable gains under subsection (1), shall be treated for purposes of corporation tax as if they were allowable losses accruing to the company while within the charge to corporation tax and not earlier than the year 1965-66.

(5) Capital gains tax shall not be charged under this section in respect of gains accruing to an overseas trade corporation on the disposal of assets which constitute property, or an interest in property, which is situated outside the United Kingdom and directly employed for the purposes of a trade carried on by the overseas trade corporation; and accordingly losses arising on the disposal of assets situated outside the United Kingdom which constitute property, or an interest in property, directly employed for the purposes of a trade carried on by an overseas trade corporation shall not be allowable losses for purposes of this section.

(6) The provisions applicable by virtue of this Part of this Act to corporation tax in respect of chargeable gains shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in relation to capital gains tax chargeable by virtue of this section, in so far as they are provisions which—

(a) confer or relate to any exemption or relief from tax, including the relief from tax of gains not received in the United Kingdom, or provide for any corresponding restriction of allowable losses; or

(8) For purposes of this section a company’s share capital in any period shall be computed by taking the initial capital and adjusting it—

(a) by adding the amount or value of any consideration actually received during the period for the issue of share capital or on the payment up of issued share capital, but so that the addition shall be reduced in each case by such fraction of the amount or value as the part of the period before receipt is of the whole period; and

(b) by deducting the amount or value of any money or other assets paid or transferred by the company during the period for the repayment of any share capital, but so that the deduction shall be reduced in each case by such fraction of the amount or value as the part of the period before the payment or transfer is of the whole period.

(10) For purposes of this section the amount of a company’s profits for any period when it was an overseas trade corporation shall be computed as if it had never been an overseas trade corporation; and any amount treated by virtue of this section as dividends paid in the year 1966-67 shall be disregarded for purposes of section 26 of the Finance Act 1957 1957 c. 49. (under which an overseas trade corporation is chargeable to income tax by reference to dividends paid out of exempt trading income), and shall for this purpose be treated as comprising dividends paid later rather than dividends paid earlier.

(11) Where a company has in the year 1965-66 paid a gross amount in dividends greater than the standard amount, it may, not later than two years after the end of that year, apply to the Board to be exempted from the foregoing provisions of this section, and if the company shows that it was not the company’s main purpose or one of its main purposes in paying that excess to avoid or reduce a liability under section 47(3) of this Act in respect of dividends paid after that year, the Board shall certify that the company is entitled to exemption under this subsection, and subsection (1) above shall then not apply to the company.

If on an application duly made by a company the Board refuse a certificate under this subsection, the company shall have the like right of appeal to the Special Commissioners against the refusal as if it were an assessment made on the company under Schedule D, and the enactments relating to an appeal against such an assessment (including any enactment relating to die statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court) shall apply accordingly.

menced to carry on business) the excess shall as regards that company be brought into account under sections 47(3) and 48 of this Act as if it were the gross amount of dividends paid by the company on the first day of the year 1966-67 after deduction of income tax at the standard rate for that year (and were not the subject of an election under section 48(3)):

Provided that any capital dividend paid after 27th April 1965 shall be regarded for the purposes of this subsection as having been paid before that date if—

(i) it was declared by the company in general meeting

before that date; or

(ii) it was declared in general meeting after that date but in accordance with a recommendation of the directors and the directors* decision to make that recommendation was, with the authority of the directors, publicly announced before that date; or

(iii) it was paid in accordance with a decision of the directors, and that decision was, with their authority, publicly announced before that date.

(13) For the purposes of this section “ gross amount ’* in relation to any dividends paid or treated as paid means the amount which, after deduction of income tax thereon at the standard rate for the year of assessment when the payment or supposed payment takes place, is equal to the amount paid or treated as paid:

Provided that the gross amount of dividends paid after deduction of income tax at a reduced rate in accordance with section 19 of the Finance Act 1962 shall be determined by reference to that reduced rate instead of the standard rate.

(14) This section shall not apply to a company which has ceased to carry on business before the year 1966-67 or of which the business is at the beginning of that year being carried on by a liquidator in the winding up of the company, nor shall this section have effect by virtue of section 69 of the Finance Act 1960 in relation to the trustees of a unit trust scheme.

84.—(1) Where a company resident in the United Kingdom shows, as regards the base year (that is to say, such one of the years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65 as the company may select as its base year for purposes of this section),—

(a) that the company possessed an overseas source of trading income; and

(b) that in respect of that source there was allowed credit for foreign tax which exceeds the current charge to corporation tax in any of the seven years of assessment beginning with the year 1966-67, calculated on the income from the source in the base year;

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

529

then for each source and each of those seven years for which it is shown to be so, the company shall, subject to the adjustments and restrictions below mentioned, be given relief in an amount equal to the excess at (b) above:

Provided that the aggregate relief for all sources, as calculated apart from this proviso, shall be reduced by one-fifth in the year 1969-70, by two-fifths in the year 1970-71, by three-fifths in the year 1971-72 and by four-fifths in the year 1972-73.

(2) The aggregate relief for any year of assessment, as calculated in accordance with subsection (1) above apart from any reduction under the proviso to that subsection, shall, where necessary, be reduced so as not to exceed the adjusted aggregate amount in the related period of the unused credit for foreign tax in respect of the company's income from overseas sources of trading income; and for this purpose the said aggregate amount is to be adjusted by computing the unused credit for foreign tax in respect of the income from any source—

(a) where the company is not within the charge to corpora-

tion tax in respect of the source, by treating the income as nevertheless chargeable to corporation tax and not chargeable to income tax or profits tax; and

(b) where the foreign tax is more than 56J per cent, by

disallowing the unused credit in respect of the excess; and

(c) by calculating the income without any deduction for the

unused credit

(3) The aggregate relief for any year of assessment, as calculated in accordance with the foregoing subsections apart from any reduction under the proviso to subsection (1), shall, where necessary, be reduced so as not to exceed the amount after deducting income tax borne by the company on franked investment income of the income tax deducted or deductible from the company's dividends paid in that year, reduced in the proportion (if it is less than one) which, in the related period, the amount charged to corporation tax of the company's income from overseas sources of trading income having an unused credit for foreign tax bears to the amount so charged of the company's income from all sources:

Provided that—

(a) the amount of any income shall for purposes of this

subsection be calculated without deduction for any unused credit for foreign tax; and

(b) where in the related period or any part of it, the company

is not within the charge to corporation tax in respect of any source of income, this subsection shall have effect

in relation thereto as if income from the source (so for as of a description chargeable to corporation tax) had been charged to corporation tax and not charged to income tax or profits tax.

(4) If, in any year of assessment for which relief is claimed, the net amount of the dividends paid by the company exceeds the net amount of the company’s dividends in each of the four years of assessment 1962-63, 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66, then the aggregate relief, as calculated in accordance with the foregoing subsections apart from any reduction under the proviso to subsection (1), shall be reduced by four-fifths of whichever excess is the least:

Provided that—

(a) if the net amount of the dividends in any of the years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65 is higher than the corresponding amount for the year before that year, and is also higher than the corresponding amount for the year after (adjusted, if it is the year 1965-66, for the increase in the standard rate of income tax), the year to which this applies shall be left out of account, but if it applies to the year 1962-63, the year 1961-62 shall be substituted; and

(b) in determining whether there is any such excess in the

case of the year 1965-66, or what is the amount of that excess, there shall be deducted from the dividends paid in that year any amount treated under section 83 of this Act as paid in the following year; and

(c) if between any earlier year of assessment and that for

which relief is claimed there has been any increase in the paid up share capital of the company for any new consideration received by the company, then the dividends paid in the earlier year shall be treated as increased by such amount as is equal before deduction of income tax therefrom to six per cent of the amount or value of that consideration.

(5) Where, in any year of assessment for which relief is claimed, the company by virtue of an election under section 48 of this Act pays any dividends without deduction of income tax, then the relief shall be reduced in the proportion which those dividends bear to the total amount of the dividends paid by the company in that year or, if all the dividends so paid are paid without deduction of income tax, relief shall not be given to the company for that year.

(6) In relation to the cases dealt with by Schedule 20 to this Act, this section shall have effect subject to the provisions of that Schedule.

(7) A company entitled to relief under this section shall, on Part IV making a claim to the inspector and on proof to his satisfaction

of the amount due, be paid by the Board out of moneys provided by Parliament a sum equal to that amount (which shall not be treated as income for purposes of corporation tax); but the Board may by statutory instrument make regulations as to the time and manner of making claims for relief, and the information and evidence to be furnished in connection therewith, and as to the manner in which any sums paid by way of relief and afterwards found not to have been due may be recovered.

Section 9 of the Income Tax Management Act 1964 shall apply 1964 c. 37. to any claim under this section.

(8) For the calculation of relief under this section—

(a) references to income in the base year and to the protits

tax thereon are references to income as computed for the charge to income tax for that year (omitting any amount on which relief from tax is allowed otherwise than by way of credit for foreign tax or on which the company charges the tax against any other person otherwise than under section 184 of the Income Tax 1952 c. 10. Act 1952) and to the profits tax on the income of the period used in the computation;

(b) “credit for foreign tax” means a credit under Part XIII of the Income Tax Act 1952 and, in relation to the base year, means the credit allowed against income tax for that year and, where credit was allowed against income tax, any credit allowed against the profits tax on the income in the base year, and “ unused credit for foreign tax” means foreign tax which cannot be allowed as a credit because the foreign tax exceeds the United Kingdom taxes;

(c) “ the current charge to corporation tax ” means in rela-

tion to any year of assessment the corporation tax which, at the rate for the preceding financial year, would be chargeable on the income in question;

(d)“ dividend ” does not include a capital dividend, and in relation to any dividends “net amount” means the amount, less any income tax deducted or deductible, and “income tax deducted or deductible” includes any income tax that might have been deducted but for the dividends being group income;

(e) “ the related period ” in relation to any year of assessment is the company’s accounting period ending at or last before the beginning of that year or, if that is a period of less than twelve months, the twelve months ending with that period (the necessary amounts for

532

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

Part IV any such period of twelve months being found by

division and aggregation or apportionment of amounts for accounting periods wholly or partly comprised in it).

(9) For the purposes of this section “ overseas source of trading income” means a trade exercised outside the United Kingdom by the company claiming relief (a trade exercised in more than one territory being for this purpose regarded as so many separate trades), except that it includes also any investment of that company in a company resident in a territory outside the United Kingdom where either—

(a) the company claiming relief controls directly or

indirectly, not less than one tenth of the voting power in the latter company; or

(b) a third company having such control also controls

directly or indirectly, not less than one-half of the voting power in the company claiming relief.

Transitional relief for companies paying

dividends out of pre-1966-67 profits.

85.—(1) With a view to taking account in relation to distributions made by a company in or after the year 1966-67 (but not after the year 1968-69) of income tax borne by the company in earlier years of assessment, a company resident in the United Kingdom shall be entitled to be treated for purposes of section 48 of this Act as if the provisions of that section about the carry forward from one year to another of a surplus of franked investment income applied to a carry forward from the year 1965-66, and as if in that year the company had had a surplus of franked investment income of an amount computed in accordance with this section (“ the notional surplus ”).

(2) Subject to subsections (7) and (8) below, the notional surplus shall be whichever is the greater of—

(a) an amount (“ the one year surplus ”) calculated so that income tax on it at the standard rate for the year 1965-66 may represent, according to the rules prescribed by this section, the proportion referable to the company’s income arising in that year which is subject to income tax and profits tax of the extra charge to those taxes as compared with a charge to corporation tax, but so that the one year surplus shall not exceed the amount on which the repayments of income tax under this section would equal the income tax paid by the company on distributions made by it in the year 1966-67;

(b) an amount (“the three year surplus”) calculated in accordance with the rules prescribed by this section to represent the excess, adjusted for any relief under section 84 of this Act, of the company’s dividends (other

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

533

than capital dividends) in the years 1966-67. 1967-68 Part IV and 1968-69 over the distributable profits of the financial years 1966. 1967 and 1968, but so that the three-year surplus shall not exceed the amount on which the repayments of income tax under this section would equal the income tax ultimately borne by the company in the years 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66.

(3) For the calculation of the one year surplus, the extra charge to income tax and profits tax as compared with a charge to corporation tax for the year 1965-66 shall be arrived at (subject to subsection (4) below) by aggregating—

(a) the income tax (at the standard rate or the net United

Kingdom rate, as the case may be) deducted from dividends received by the company in the year from companies resident in the United Kingdom, in so far as that tax is ultimately borne by the company; and

(b) the profits tax charged on the company for any charge-

able accounting period or part of a chargeable accounting period falling within the year (or, if the liability to profits tax was affected by a notice under section 22 of the Finance Act 1937 (groups of companies), 1937 c. 54. the tax which would have been so charged but for the notice); and

(c) the appropriate fraction of the income tax ultimately

borne by the company on income arising in die year other than the tax deducted from dividends received from companies resident in the United Kingdom, the appropriate fraction being that obtained by dividing by the standard rate of income tax for the year the difference between that rate and the rate of corporation tax for the financial year 1965;

and the proportion of this referable to the company's income arising in the year which is subject to income tax and profits tax shall be taken to be the fraction obtained by dividing the aggregate amount of the income tax at (a) and (c) above by the sum of that amount and the amount of the corporation tax charged on the company for the financial year 1965.

The reference in paragraph (c) above to income arising in the year shall, where income tax is to be computed by reference to the amount received in the United Kingdom, be construed as a reference to the income so received.

(4) Where the dividends received by the company in the year 1965-66 include dividends from a member of the same group of companies, and that member pays in the year a gross amount in dividends greater than its standard amount, then there shall be excluded from the dividends taken into account under subsection (3) (a) above a part of the dividends received from that

534

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

Part IV member which bears to the whole the same proportion as the excess bears to all the dividends paid by that member in the year 1965-66:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply unless the gross amount of the dividends received by the company in the year 1965-66 from members of the same group of companies exceeds one-third of the gross amount of the dividends received by the company in its standard period from companies then being members of the same group of companies (or, if the standard period is less than three years, an amount bearing to the dividends last mentioned die same proportion as one year bears to the standard period), and where any dividends would fall to be excluded under this subsection, the company may elect that the exclusion shall be of such part of the dividends received from members of the same group as is equal to the excess referred to in this proviso.

This subsection shall be construed in accordance with section 83 of and Schedule 19 to this Act

(5) In arriving at the amount ultimately borne by the company of the income tax at (3)(a) and (c) above, the deduction of tax by the company under section 184 (dividends) of the

1952 c. 10. Income Tax Act 1952 shall not be treated as reducing the tax ultimately borne by the company, but any tax otherwise charged against any person by the company and any relief under section 341 of that Act (relief for trade loss against general income) shall be set, as far as may be, against income tax borne by the company in the year other than the tax at 3(a) or (c), then against die tax at (3)(c), then against the tax at (3)(a).

(6) For the calculation of the three year surplus—

(a) the dividends in the three years of assessment shall

be taken before deduction of income tax, and (except in the calculation under paragraph (c) below) shall be taken to include any amount treated under section 83 of this Act as a dividend paid in the year 1966-67;

(b) the distributable profits for the three financial years

shall be arrived at by taking the profits on which corporation tax is charged for those years, less the corporation tax so charged and any credit for foreign tax allowed against corporation tax, and less the amount of any directors* remuneration not deductible in computing those profits, and adding—

(i) franked investment income and group income received in those years;

(ii) the amount of any deductions made in assessing that tax for investment allowances or scientific

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

535

research allowances (on the basis that deductions Part IV for capital allowances are referred to other allowances in priority to investment or scientific research allowances), and of any deductions so made for losses, allowances or expenses of management of any period falling outside those years;

(c) the excess of the dividends at (a) above over the distributable profits at (b) above shall be adjusted for relief under section 84 by—

(i) finding the balance of those dividends that remains after deduction of the amount on which income tax at the standard rate for the year 1965-66 would equal the aggregate relief under section 84 for the three years of assessment; and

(ii) reducing the excess in the proportion which that balance bears to the actual dividends;

(d) the income tax ultimately borne by the company in the years 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66 shall be taken to be the amount borne by it in respect of its income by deduction or otherwise (at the standard rate or at the net United Kingdom rate), after deduction of all reliefs and of all tax charged in any of those years against any other person under section 184 of the Income Tax Act 1952 or otherwise. 1952 c. 10.

(7) Where a company is wound up, the three year surplus shall be computed by reference to the period ending with its last accounting period, if that ends before the end of the financial year 1968.

(8) If in the case of any company the income tax at (3)(a) and (c) above is not greater than the corporation tax with which the company is charged for the financial year 1965, any one year surplus shall be disregarded, and the notional surplus shall be taken to be the three year surplus (if any).

(9) Relief may be claimed and allowed under this section by reference to any one year surplus, notwithstanding that the notional surplus may fall to be finally determined by reference to a three year surplus.

(10) Part I of Schedule 12 to this Act shall have effect in relation to claims for relief under this section as it has effect in relation to other claims made for purposes of section 48 of this Act, except that a claim under this section may be made in relation to a one year surplus before the time otherwise allowed under the said Part I and, if made before the passing of an Act fixing the rate of corporation tax for the financial year 1965, may be determined (subject to later adjustment if

need be) in accordance with any Resolution for fixing that rate which may have been passed by the Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Commons and agreed to by the House.

(11) In a case where section 350 of the Income Tax Act 1952 applies, the tax deducted from a dividend shall be deemed for purposes of this section to be tax at the net United Kingdom rate, for the purpose of reckoning either the tax borne by the recipient or the tax charged against another person by the company paying the dividend; and the amount charged against another person by deduction of tax from any other payment shall for the purposes of this section, in a case to which section 350(2) applies, be taken not to include the tax chargeable under section 170 of that Act by virtue of section 350(2).

(12) A company claiming relief under this section may, if the greater part of its undertaking consists in the ownership or operation of ships, elect that in die application to it of subsection

(2) (b) above there shall be substituted for the income tax ultimately borne by the company in the years 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66 the income tax ultimately borne by it in a period ending with the year 1965-66, but beginning with such year of assessment earlier than the year 1963-64, but not earlier than the year 1956-57, as may be specified in the election; and subsection

(6) id) shall then apply to the years comprised in that period as it is expressed to apply to the years 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66.

86.—(1) Where a water company is liable to account for and pay income tax in respect of dividends paid by it in the year 1966-67 or either of the two following years of assessment, the Minister of Housing and Local Government may, subject to such conditions as he sees fit to impose, make to the Board such payments towards satisfaction of that liability as are authorised by this section, and his expenses of so doing shall be defrayed out of moneys provided by Parliament.

(2) In computing the payments authorised by this section to be made for the benefit of a water company in respect of dividends paid in any year of assessment, there shall be deducted from the amount of the dividends paid in the year—

(a) the amount of any franked investment income received

by the company in the year; and

(b) forty per cent, of the related profits on which the com-

pany is charged to corporation tax.

(3) For purposes of subsection (2) (b) above the related profits on which the company is charged to corporation tax are, in relation to dividends paid for any period, the amount of the profits on which the company is so charged in respect of that period (ascertained, if need be, by division and apportionment

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

537

or aggregation of amounts for accounting periods wholly or partly comprised in that period), but where dividends are paid for the same period in more than one year of assessment, the said amount shall be apportioned rateably between the parts paid in each of those years.

(4) The payment that may be made under this section in respect of a company's dividends shall be an amount not exceeding for the year 1966-67 three-quarters, for the year 1967-68 one-half and for the year 1968-69 one-quarter of the amount (if any) by which income tax at the standard rate on the amount ascertained in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) above exceeds the yield to the company in that year of a water rate of twopence in the pound.

(5) No payment shall be made for the benefit of a company under this section except on a claim made to the Minister of Housing and Local Government in such manner, and supported by such evidence, as he may direct; and it shall be lawful for the Board and their officers to disclose to the Minister such particulars as he may reasonably require for determining whether any, and if so what, payment is authorised by this section in the case of any company.

(6) In relation to water companies whose area of supply lies wholly or mainly in Wales references to the Secretary of State shall be substituted in this section for the references to the Minister of Housing and Local Government.

(7) In this section “water company” means any company (being a body corporate) which is a statutory water undertaker for purposes of the Water Act 1945.

(8) Notwithstanding anything in the Government of Ireland Act 1920 the Parliament of Northern Ireland shall have power to make laws for purposes similar to the purposes of this section.

87.—(1) Where a company is, in respect of any source of income, within the charge to corporation tax under any relevant Case of Schedule D during the year 1965-66, and ceases to possess that source at any time between that year and the year 1971-72, then subject to the provisions of this section the company shall be entitled to relief from tax in respect of any amount by which, if the company had ceased to possess the source at the end of the year 1965-66, the taxed income from the source during the cessation period would have been less than the actual taxed income during that period.

(2) Relief under this section shall be an allowance equal to whichever is the less of—

(a) the amount referred to in subsection (1) above; and

(b) an amount equal to the appropriate fraction of the taxed income from the source during a period equal in length to the cessation period but ending when the company ceases to possess the source:

Provided that if the company ceases to possess the source in the year 1968-69 the allowance shall be reduced by one quarter: if in the year 1969-70, by one half: and if in the year 1970-71, by three-quarters.

(3) Where a company is entitled to an allowance under this section in respect of any source of income, then for the purpose of any liability of the company to corporation tax or income tax (but not for any other purpose) the amount of the income arising to the company from the source shall be treated as reduced by the amount of the allowance (the reduction being made, as far as may be, in the income arising in accounting periods for which the company is chargeable to corporation tax in respect of the source and, subject to that, in the income chargeable to income tax before the year 1966-67, and being made, as far as may be, in the income of a later rather than in that of an earlier period or year); and relief under this section shall be given in priority to any other relief.

(4) For purposes of this section “ taxed income ” means, in relation to any source, the amount of the income falling to be included in assessments for the purpose of charging the company to income tax or corporation tax in respect of the source.

(5) For purposes of this section the relevant Cases of Schedule D are Cases I to V; and in relation to any Source of income—

(a) “ the cessation period ” means the period over which

assessments to income tax might have been revised on the company ceasing to possess the source at the end of the year 1965-66 (and accordingly is three years for Cases I and II and two years for Cases III, IV and V); and

(b) “ the appropriate fraction ” is such fraction of the

cessation period as falls after the time when the company is first within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the source (and accordingly is, for Cases III, IV and V, one half).

(6) In relation to Cases I and II of Schedule D, the provisions contained in Schedule 21 to this Act shall have effect to supplement the foregoing subsections, and those subsections shall have effect subject to and in accordance with those provisions.

(7) In relation to Cases III, IV and V of Schedule D, this section shall, if a company at any material time ceases to possess part of a source of income, apply as if that part had

been a separate source, but shall not apply to a source or part of a source where the income from it falls to be charged in accordance with section 430(1) of the Income Tax Act 1952 (which relates to the taxation of investment income of certain life assurance companies).

(8) There shall be made any such adjustments of any person’s liability to corporation tax or income tax, whether by way of repayment of tax, assessment or otherwise, as may be necessary to give effect to this section or Schedule 21 to this Act, and any such adjustment may be made at any time not later than six years after the event giving rise to the adjustment

(a) franked investment income and group income shall be included, but not profits which are neither bona fide earned in the ordinary course of business nor produce of income yielding assets;

(b) no regard shall be had—

(i) to any investment allowances, initial allowances or balancing charges; nor

(ii) to any deduction falling to be made in respect of losses, allowances or expenses of management outside the period in which a deduction originally falls to be made in respect thereof; nor

(iii) to any restriction on the deduction that may be made for directors’ remuneration;

This subsection shall apply for determining a loss sustained by a company in an accounting year as it applies for determining the net income for an accounting year.

(3) In Schedule 7 to the Finance Act 1940, in paragraph 4(1) (which provides for making adjustments for purposes of Part IV of that Act in respect of an addition’s having been made to the assets of the company) the reference to receipts representing income in respect of which the company was liable to pay or bear income tax shall include any franked investment income or group income and the reference to income tax shall include corporation tax.

(2) If on a claim made to the Commissioners not later than two years after the making or execution of an instrument chargeable with duty in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, it is shown to their satisfaction—

(a) that the sale in contemplation of which the instru-

ment was made or executed has not taken place and the property has been re-conveyed or re-transferred to the person from whom it was conveyed or transferred or to a person to whom his rights have been transmitted on death or bankruptcy; or

(b) that the sale has taken place for a consideration which

is less than the value in respect of which duty was paid on the instrument by virtue of this section.

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

the Commissioners shall repay the duty paid by virtue of this section, in a case falling under paragraph (a) of this subsection, so far as it exceeds the stamp duty which would have been payable apart from this section and, in a case falling under paragraph (b) of this subsection, so far as it exceeds the stamp duty which would have been payable if the instrument had been stamped in accordance with subsection (1) of this section in respect of a value equal to the consideration in question:

Provided that, in a case falling under the said paragraph (b), duty shall not be repayable if it appears to the Commissioners that the circumstances are such that a conveyance or transfer on the sale in question would have been chargeable with duty under section 74 of the Finance (1909-10) Act 1910 by virtue of subsection (5) of that section (conveyances and transfers on sale chargeable as voluntary dispositions if for inadequate consideration).

(3) No instrument chargeable with duty in accordance with subsection (1) of this section shall be deemed to be duly stamped unless the Commissioners have been required to express their opinion thereon under section 12 of the said Act of 1891 and have expressed their opinion thereon in accordance with that section.

(4) The foregoing provisions of this section shall apply whether or not an instrument conveys or transfers other property in addition to the property in contemplation of the sale of which it is made or executed, but those provisions shall not affect the stamp duty chargeable on the instrument in respect of that other property.

(5) For the purposes of the said section 74 and of subsection (1) of this section, the value of property conveyed or transferred by an instrument chargeable with duty in accordance with either of those provisions shall be determined without regard to—

(a) any power (whether or not contained in the instru-

ment) on the exercise of which the property, or any part of or any interest in, the property, may be revested in the person from whom it was conveyed or transferred or in any person on his behalf;

(b) any annuity reserved out of the property or any part

of it, or any life or other interest so reserved, being an interest which is subject to forfeiture;

but if on a claim made to the Commissioners not later than two years after the making or execution of the instrument it is shown to their satisfaction that any such power as is mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection has been exercised in relation to the property and the property or any property representing it has been re-conveyed or re-transferred in the whole or

in part in consequence of that exercise the Commissioners shall repay the stamp duty paid by virtue of this subsection, in a case where the whole of such property has been so re-conveyed or re-transferred, so far as it exceeds the stamp duty which would have been payable apart from this subsection and, in any other case, so far as it exceeds the stamp duty which would have been payable if the instrument had operated to convey or transfer only such property as is not so re-conveyed or retransferred.

(6) This section shall be construed as one with the said Act of 1891.

(7) This section shall come into force on 1st August 1965.

(2) The method of calculating the said grants shall be such as the Minister of Transport may with die approval of the Treasury from time to time determine, either generally or in particular cases or classes of case, but the amount of a grant shall not exceed sixpence for every gallon of fuel used or estimated to have been used in operating the bus service during the period to which the grant relates.

(3) If the operator of a bus service fails without reasonable excuse (the proof whereof shall be on him) to comply with a condition imposed on him as mentioned in subsection (1) of this section—

(a) requiring the compiling, preservation or production of

running sheets, accounts or other records relating to the operation of the service; or

(b) requiring facilities to be afforded for the inspection,

(b) wilfully makes a false entry in any running sheet,

account or other record which is or may be required to be produced in pursuance of any condition such as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section or, with intent to deceive, makes use for the purposes of this section of any such record which he knows to be false;

he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or a fine not exceeding £100 or both, or on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or a fine or both.

(5) Where an offence under this section which has been committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with die consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or any person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, he as well as the body corporate shall be deemed to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.

(6) No proceedings for an offence under this section shall be instituted in England and Wales except by or with the consent of the Minister of Transport or the Director of Public Prosecutions.

(7) Section 104 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1952 and 1952 c. 55. section 23 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland) Act 1954 1954 c. 48. (summary proceedings to be commenced within six months from commission of offence) shall apply to offences under this section

with the substitution of a reference to three years for each reference to six months:

Provided that this subsection shall not enable an information to be tried in England and Wales or proceedings to be heard in Scotland where the information was laid or the proceedings were commenced more than twelve months after evidence sufficient in the opinion of the appropriate authority to justify them came to his knowledge; and for this purpose a certificate of the appropriate authority as to the date on which such evidence came to his knowledge shall be conclusive evidence.

In this subsection “the appropriate authority” means the Minister of Transport or, in the case of proceedings which are brought by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions or, in Scodand, are not preceded by a report of the

(ii) included that function and such activities,

the Minister may make grants to the association out of moneys provided by Parliament for affording relief, in a case falling within paragraph (6)(i) above, from any tax chargeable on the association for that period or, in a case falling within paragraph (b)(ii) above, from such part of any tax so chargeable as the Minister considers appropriate having regard to the other functions of the association.

(2) Any grant under this section shall be of such amount, shall be made at such times and in such manner and shall be subject to such conditions as the Minister thinks fit, including conditions for securing the repayment in whole or in part of any grant made to an association in the event of any tax in respect of which it was made subsequently being found not to be chargeable or in such other events (including the association subsequently beginning to trade for profit) as the Minister may determine.

(3) Any claim under this section shall be made in such manner and shall be supported by such evidence as the Minister may direct; and it shall be lawful for the Commissioners of Inland Revenue and their officers to disclose to the Minister such particulars as he may reasonably require for determining

whether a grant should be made on any claim or whether any Part V such grant should be repaid or the amount of any such grant or repayment.

(4) In subsection (1) of this section references to tax chargeable on an association are references to income tax (other than income tax which the association is entitled to deduct on making any payment), profits tax and corporation tax, but no relief shall be afforded under this section in respect of income tax for any period before 6th April 1965 or profits tax for any period before the beginning of April 1965 (any profits tax for a chargeable accounting period beginning before and ending after that time being duly apportioned).

(5) In this section “the Minister” means, in the case of a housing association in England, the Minister of Housing and Local Government and, in the case of a housing association in Scotland or in Wales, the Secretary of State.

of the Housing Act 1957 or section 184(1) of the 1957 c. 56. Housing (Scotland) Act 1950; or 1950 c. 34.

(b) would be a housing association as so defined if references in those sections to houses and housing accommodation included references to hostels as defined in section 15(4) of the Housing (Financial Provisions)

Act 1958 or section 89(7) of the said Act of 1950; 1958 c. 42.

Capital Gains: Computation Part I

General

1. The provisions of this Schedule shall have effect for computing for the purposes of this Part of this Act the amount of a gain accruing on the disposal of an asset.

Exclusion from consideration for disposals of sums chargeable to income tax or corporation tax

2.—(1) There shall be excluded from the consideration for a disposal of assets taken into account in the computation under this Schedule of the gain accruing on that disposal any money or money’s worth charged to income tax as income of, or taken into account as a receipt in computing income or profits or gains or losses of, the person making the disposal for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts.

(2) The foregoing sub-paragraph shall not be taken as excluding from the consideration so taken into account any money or money’s worth which is taken into account in the making of a balancing charge under Part X or Part XI of the Income Tax Act 1952 1952 c. 10. (Capital allowances).

(3) This paragraph shall not preclude the taking into account in a computation under this Schedule, as consideration for the disposal of an asset, of the capitalised value of a rentcharge (as in a case where a rentcharge is exchanged for some other asset) or of the capitalised value of a ground annual or feu duty, or of a right of any other description to income or to payments in the nature of income over a period, or to a series of payments in the nature of income.

Exclusion of short-term gains

3.—(1) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 2(1) of this Schedule, and subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, a gain accruing on a disposal of an asset which is a disposal chargeable under Case VII of Schedule D shall not be a chargeable gain for the purposes of this Part of this Act.

forming part of settled property deemed to be effected by him under section 25(3) of this Act when a person becomes absolutely entitled to it as against the trustee shall not be a chargeable gain for the purposes of this Part of this Act—

(a) if by virtue of paragraph 4(2) of the said Schedule 9 that person is treated as if the acquisition of the asset by the trustee had been his acquisition of it, and

(b) if that person disposes of the asset in circumstances such that the disposal is chargeable under Case VII.

(4) A gain accruing on a disposal to which paragraph 5(1) of the said Schedule 9 (sale at an undervalue) applies shall not be a chargeable gain for the purposes of this Part of this Act if the person acquiring assets on the disposal disposes of those assets in circumstances such that the disposal is chargeable under Case VII.

(5) The amount or value of the consideration for the acquisition of an asset by the person acquiring it on a disposal chargeable under Case VII shall not under any provision of this Part of this Act be deemed to be an amount greater than the amount taken into account as consideration on that disposal for the purposes of Case VII.

(6) Neither paragraph 2 of this Schedule nor sub-paragraph (1) above shall apply in relation to a disposal which is chargeable under Case VII in consequence of the provisions of section 14 of the

1962 c. 44. Finance Act 1962 (disposals of land effected indirectly) if, under the said section 14(2)(i), the amount on which the said person is chargeable to tax is reduced, but the amount of the gain accruing on the disposal for the purposes of this Part of this Act shall not exceed the amount of the reduction.

This sub-paragraph shall be applied before any provision of this Part of this Act which makes pan of a gain a chargeable gain, and part not.

(7) Any apportionment of consideration or expenditure falling to be made in relation to a disposal chargeable under Case VII in accordance with section 13(3) of the Finance Act 1962, and in particular in a case where section 13(5) of that Act (enhancement of value of land by acquisition of adjoining land) applies, shall be followed for the purposes of this Part of this Act both in relation to a disposal of the assets acquired on the disposal chargeable under Case VII and, where the disposal chargeable under Case VII is a part disposal, in relation to a disposal of what remains undisposed of.

(8) In this paragraph references to a disposal chargeable under Case VII are references to cases where the acquisition and disposal is in circumstances such that the gain accruing on it is chargeable under Case VII of Schedule D, or where it would be so chargeable if there were a gain so accruing.

Schedule any expenditure which, if the assets, or all the assets to which the computation relates, were, and had at all times been, held or used as part of the fixed capital of a trade the profits or gains of which were (irrespective of whether the person making the disposal is a company or not) chargeable to income tax would be allowable as a deduction in computing the profits or gains or losses of the trade for the purposes of income tax.

Restriction of losses by reference to capital allowances and renewals allowances

6.—(1) The last foregoing paragraph shall not require the exclusion from die sums allowable as a deduction in the computation under this Schedule of any expenditure as being expenditure in respect of which a capital allowance or renewals allowance is made, but the amount of any losses accruing on the disposal of an asset shall be restricted by reference to capital allowances and renewals allowances as follows.

(2) In the computation under this Schedule of the amount of a loss accruing to the person making the disposal, there shall be excluded from the sums allowable as a deduction any expenditure to the extent to which any capital allowance or renewals allowance has been or may be made in respect of it.

(3) If the person making the disposal acquired the asset—

under paragraph 4 of Schedule 14 to the Income Tax Act 1952 was made, or

(b) by a transfer to which paragraph 6 or paragraph 7 of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1952 applies,

(being enactments under which a transfer is treated for the purposes of capital allowances as being made at written down value), the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall apply as if any capital allowance made to the transferor in respect of the asset had (except so far as any loss to the transferor was restricted under those provisions) been made to the person making the disposal (that is the transferee); and where the transferor acquired the asset by such a transfer, capital allowances which by virtue of this sub-paragraph can be taken into account in relation to the transferor shall also be taken into account in relation to the transferee (that is the person making the disposal), and so on for any series of transfers before the disposal.

(6) The amount of capital allowances to be taken into account under this paragraph in relation to a disposal include any allowances falling to be made by reference to the event which is the disposal, and there shall be deducted from the amount of the allowances the amount of any balancing charge to which effect has been or is to be given by reference to the event which is the disposal, or any earlier event, and of any balancing charge to which effect might have been so given but for the making of an election under section 296 of the Income Tax Act 1952 (option in case of replacement of machinery 1952 c. 10. or plant).

Part disposals

7.—(1) Where a person disposes of an interest or right in or over an asset and, generally wherever on the disposal of an asset any description of property derived from that asset remains undisposed of, the sums which under paragraphs ( ) and (b) of paragraph 4(1) of this Schedule are attributable to die asset shall, both for the purposes of the computation under this Schedule of the gain accruing on the disposal and for the purpose of applying this Schedule in relation to the property which remains undisposed of, be apportioned.

(2) The apportionment shall be made by reference—

(a) to the amount or value of the consideration for the disposal on the one hand (call that amount or value A), and

(b) to the market value of the property which remains undisposed of on the other hand (call that market value B),

and accordingly the fraction of the said sums allowable as a deduction in computing under this Schedule the amount of the gain

A

accruing on the disposal shall be A _ ,and the remainder shall

A + J3

be attributed to the property which remains undisposed of.

(3) Any apportionment to be made in pursuance of this paragraph shall be made before operating the provisions of the last foregoing paragraph, and if, after a part disposal, there is a subsequent disposal of an asset the capital allowances or renewals allowances to be token into account in pursuance of that paragraph in relation to the subsequent disposal shall, subject to the next following sub-paragraph, be those referable to the sums which under paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 4(1) of this Schedule are attributable to the asset whether before or after the part disposal, but those allowances shall be reduced by the amount (if any) by which the loss on the earlier disposal was restricted under the provisions of that paragraph.

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

(4) This paragraph shall not be taken as requiring the apportionment of any expenditure which, on the facts, is wholly attributable to what is disposed of, or wholly attributable to what remains undisposed of.

Assets derived front other assets

8. If and so far as, in a case where assets have been merged or divided or have changed their nature or rights or interests in or over assets have been created or extinguished, the value of an asset is derived from any other asset in the same ownership, an appropriate proportion of the sums allowable as a deduction in a computation under this Schedule in respect of the other asset under paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 4(1) of this Schedule shall, both for the purpose of the computation of a gain accruing on the disposal of the first-mentioned asset and, if the other asset remains in existence, on a disposal of that other asset, be attributed to the first-mentioned asset.

Wasting assets

9. —(1) In this Schedule “wasting asset” means an asset with a predictable life not exceeding fifty years but so that—

(a) freehold land shall not be a wasting asset whatever its nature, and whatever the nature of the buildings or works on it,

(b) animals shall not be regarded as wasting assets so long as they are immature,

(c) “ life ”, in relation to any tangible moveable property, means

useful life, having regard to the purpose for which the tangible assets were acquired or provided by the person making the disposal,

(d) plant and machinery shall in every case be regarded as having a predictable life of less than fifty years, and in estimating that life it shall be assumed that its life will end when it is finally put out of use as being unfit for further use, and that it is going to be used in the normal manner and to the normal extent and is going to be so used throughout its life as so estimated,

(e) a life interest in settled property shall not be a wasting

asset until the predictable expectation of life of the life tenant is fifty years or less, and the predictable life of life interests in settled property and of annuities shall be ascertained from actuarial tables approved by the Board.

(2) In this Schedule “ the residual or scrap value ”, in relation to a wasting asset, means the predictable value, if any, which the wasting asset will have at the end of its predictable life as estimated in accordance with this paragraph.

(3) The question what is the predictable life of an asset, and the question what is its predictable residual or scrap value at the end of that life, if any, shall, so far as those questions are not immediately answered by the nature of the asset, be taken, in relation to any disposal of the asset, as they were known or ascertainable at the time when the asset was acquired or provided by the person making the disposal.

Wasting assets: straightline restriction of allowable expenditure

10.—(1) In the computation under this Schedule of the gain accruing on the disposal of a wasting asset it shall be assumed—

(a) that any expenditure attributable to the asset under para-

graph 4(1 Xa) of this Schedule after deducting the residual or scrap value, if any, of the asset, is written off at a uniform rate from its full amount at the time when the asset is acquired or provided to nothing at the end of its life, and

(b) that any expenditure attributable to the asset under paragraph 4(1X^) of this Schedule is written off from the full amount of that expenditure at the time when that expenditure is first reflected in the state or nature of the asset to nothing at the end of its life,

so that an equal daily amount is written off day by day.

(2) Thus, calling the predictable life of a wasting asset at the time when it was acquired or provided by the person making the disposal L, the period from that time to the time of disposal T(l), and, in relation to any expenditure attributable to the asset under paragraph 4(1)(6) of this Schedule, the period from the time when that expenditure is first reflected in the state or nature of the asset to the said time of disposal T(2), there shall be excluded from the computation under this Schedule—

(a) out of the expenditure attributable to the asset under para-

T(l)

graph 4(1 Xo) of this Schedule a fraction—j— of an amount

equal to the amount of that expenditure minus the residual or scrap value, if any, of the asset, and

(6) out of the expenditure attributable to the asset under para-

graph 4(1X6) of this Schedule a fraction of the amount of the expenditure.

T(2)

L — (T(l) — T(2))

(3) If any expenditure attributable to the asset under paragraph 4(1X6) of this Schedule creates or increases a residual or scrap value of the asset, the provisions of sub-paragraph (l)(a) above shall be applied so as to take that into account.

Sch. 6

Wasting assets qualifying for capital allowances

11.—(1) The last foregoing paragraph shall not apply in relation to a disposal of an asset—

(a) which, from the beginning of the period of ownership of the person making the disposal to the time when the disposal is made, is used and used solely for the purposes of a trade, profession or vocation and in respect of which that person has claimed or could have claimed any capital allowance in respect of any expenditure attributable to the asset under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of paragraph 4(1) of this Schedule, or

564

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

Sch.6 (6) on which the person making the disposal has incurred any

expenditure which has otherwise qualified in full for any capital allowance.

(2) In the case of the disposal of an asset which, in the period of ownership of the person making the disposal, has been used partly for the purposes of a trade, profession or vocation and partly for other purposes, or has been used for the purposes of a trade, profession or vocation for part of that period, or which has otherwise qualified in part only for capital allowances,—

(a) the consideration for the disposal, and any expenditure

attributable to the asset by paragraph (a) or paragraph (6) of paragraph 4(1) of this Schedule shall be apportioned by reference to the extent to which that expenditure qualified for capital allowances, and

(b) the computation under this Schedule shall be made separately

in relation to the apportioned parts of the expenditure and consideration, and

(c) paragraph 10 of this Schedule shall not apply for the pur-

poses of the computation in relation to the part of the consideration apportioned to use for the purposes of the trade, profession or vocation, or to the expenditure qualifying for capital allowances, and

(d) if an apportionment of the consideration for the disposal has been made for the purposes of making any capital allowance to the person making the disposal or for the purpose of making any balancing charge on him, that apportionment shall be employed for the purposes of this paragraph, and

(e) subject to paragraph (d) above, the consideration for the

disposal shall be apportioned for the purposes of this paragraph in the same proportions as the expenditure attributable to the asset is apportioned under paragraph (a) above.

Premiums under policies of insurance

12. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Schedule, there shall be excluded from the sums allowable as a deduction in the computation under this Schedule of the gain accruing to a person on the disposal of an asset any premiums or other payments made under a policy of insurance of the risk of any kind of damage or injury to, or loss or depreciation of, the asset.

Compensation and insurance money

13. —(1) If the recipient so claims, receipt of a capital sum within paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of section 22(3) of this Act derived from an asset which is not lost or destroyed shall not be treated for the purposes of this Part of this Act as a disposal of the asset if—

(a) the capital sum is wholly applied in restoring the asset, or

(b) the capital sum is applied in restoring the asset except for

a part of the capital sum which is not reasonably required

r

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

565

for the purpose and which is small as compared with the whole capital sum, or

(c) the amount of the capital sum is small, as compared with the value of the asset.

but, if the receipt is not treated as a disposal, all sums which would, if the receipt had been so treated, have been brought into account as consideration for that disposal in the computation under this Schedule of a gain accruing on the disposal shall be deducted from any expenditure allowable under this Schedule as a deduction in computing a gain on the subsequent disposal of the asset.

(2) If, in a case not falling within sub-paragraph (1X6) above, a part of a capital sum within paragraph (a) or paragraph (6) of section 22(3) of this Act derived from an asset which is not lost or destroyed is applied in restoring the asset, then if the recipient so claims, that part of the capital sum shall not be treated as consideration for the disposal deemed to be effected on receipt of the capital sum but shall be deducted from any expenditure allowable under this Schedule as a deduction in computing a gain on the subsequent disposal of the asset.

(3) If an asset is lost or destroyed and a capital sum received by way of compensation for the loss or destruction, or under a policy of insurance of the risk of the loss or destruction, is within one year of receipt, or such longer period as the inspector may allow, applied in acquiring an asset in replacement of the asset lost or destroyed the owner shall if he so claims be treated for the purposes of this Part of this Act—

(a) as if the consideration for the disposal of the old asset were

(if otherwise of a greater amount) of such amount as would secure that on the disposal neither a loss nor a gain accrues to him, and

(b) as if the amount of the consideration for the acquisition of the new asset were reduced by the excess of the amount of the capital sum received by way of compensation or under the policy of insurance, together with any residual or scrap value, over the amount of the consideration which he is treated as receiving under paragraph (a) above.

(4) A claim shall not be made under sub-paragraph (3) above if part only of the capital sum is applied in acquiring the new asset but if aU of that capital sum except for a part which is less than the amount of the gain (whether all chargeable gain or not) accruing on the disposal of the old asset is so applied, then the owner shall if he so claims be treated for the purposes of this Part of this Act—

(a) as if the amount of the gain so accruing were reduced to the

amount of the said part (and, if not all chargeable gain, with a proportionate reduction in the amount of the chargeable gain), and

(b) as if the amount of the consideration for the acquisition of the new asset were reduced by the amount by which the gain is reduced under paragraph (a) of this sub-paragraph.

(5) This paragraph shall not apply in relation to a wasting asset.

(2) The proportionate parts to be regarded as accruing in the respective years of assessment shall correspond to the proportions of the amounts of the instalments of consideration payable in those respective years of assessment.

(3) The time in the year or accounting period when any such part of a chargeable gain or allowable loss is deemed to accrue under this paragraph shall be the last day in that year of assessment.

(4) Sub-paragraph (1) above shall not apply to any part of the consideration which has effectively passed to the person making the disposal by way of a loan made to that person by the other party to the transaction.

(5) In the computation under this Schedule consideration for the disposal shall be brought into account without any discount for postponement of the right to receive any part of it and, in the first instance, without regard to a risk of any part of the consideration being irrecoverable or to the right to receive any part of the consideration being contingent; and if any part of the consideration so brought into account is subsequently shown to the satisfaction of the inspector to be irrecoverable, such adjustment, whether by way of discharge or repayment of tax or otherwise, shall be made as is required in consequence.

(6) This paragraph shall not be taken as applying this Part of this Act in relation to any disposal of an asset on or before 6th April 1965 so as to make a gain accruing on that disposal a chargeable gain.

Contingent liabilities

15.—(1) In the first instance no allowance shall be made in the computation under this Schedule—

(a) in the case of a disposal by way of assigning a lease of land or other property, for any liability remaining with, or assumed by, the person making the disposal by way of assigning the lease which is contingent on a default in respect of liabilities thereby or subsequently assumed by the assignee under the terms and conditions of the lease,

(b) for any contingent liability of the person making the disposal in respect of any covenant for quiet enjoyment or other obligation assumed as vendor of land, or of any estate or interest in land, or as a lessor.

Expenses of sale and transfer in administration of estates and trusts

16. —(1) In computing under this Schedule the gain accruing on a disposal of assets deemed to be made by an individual on his death, any expenditure within paragraph 4(2) of this Schedule incurred in relation to the actual disposition by the personal representatives of those assets, whether by way of sale or by way of disposition to legatees, shall, if the personal representatives so claim, be allowable as a deduction in the computation.

of this Act) a person is assessed to surtax then in the computation under this Schedule of the gain accruing on a disposal by him of any shares forming part of his interest in the company to which the relevant apportionment relates the amount of the surtax paid by him, so far as attributable to those shares, shall be allowable as a deduction.

(2) The foregoing paragraph shall not apply in relation to surtax charged in respect of undistributed income which has, before the

(3) For the purposes of this paragraph the income assessed to surtax shall be the highest part of the individual's income for the year of assessment in question, but so that if the highest part of the said income is taken into account under this paragraph in relation to an assessment to surtax the next highest pan shall be taken into account in relation to any other relevant assessment, and so on.

(4) For the purpose of identifying shares forming part of an interest in a company with shares subsequently disposed of which are of the same class, and in the same company, shares bought at an earlier time shall be deemed to have been disposed of before shares bought at a later time.

Quoted securities

22.—(1) This paragraph applies—

(a) to shares and securities which on 6th April 1965 have quoted market values on a recognised stock exchange in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, or which have had such quoted market values at any time in the period of six years ending on 6th April 1965, and

(b) to rights of unit holders in any unit trust scheme (as defined in section 26(1) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments)

Act 1958 or section 22 of the Prevention of Fraud (Invest- 1958 c. 45. ments) Act (Northern Ireland) 1940) the prices of which 1940 c. 9 (N.I.). are published daily by the managers of the scheme.

(2) For the purposes of this Part of this Act, including Part I of this Schedule, it shall be assumed, wherever relevant, that any assets to which this paragraph applies were sold by the owner, and immediately re-acquired by him, at their market value on 6th April 1965.

(3) For the purpose of ascertaining the market value of any shares or securities in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) above—

(a) section 44(3Xa) of this Act shall have effect as if for the words “one-quarter* there were substituted the words “ one-half *, and as between the amount under paragraph (a) and the amount under paragraph ( ) of the said section 44(3) the higher, and not the lower, amount shall be chosen;

(b) section 44(4) of this Act shall have effect as if for the reference to an amount equal to the buying price there were substituted a reference to an amount half-way between the buying and selling prices;

570

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

Sch. 6 (c) where the market value of any shares or securities not within

the said section 44(3) falls to be ascertained by reference to a pair of prices quoted on a stock exchange, an adjustment shall be made so as to increase the market value by an amount corresponding to that by which any market value is increased under paragraph (a) above.

(4) Sub-paragraph (2) above shall not apply in relation to a disposal of assets—

(a) if on the assumption in that sub-paragraph a gain would

accrue on that disposal to the person making the disposal and either a smaller gain or a loss would so accrue (computed in accordance with the provisions of Part I of this Schedule) if the said sub-paragraph (2) did not apply, or

(b) if on the assumption in the said sub-paragraph (2) a loss

would so accrue and either a smaller loss or a gain would accrue if the said sub-paragraph (2) did not apply,

and accordingly the amount of the gain or loss accruing on the disposal shall be computed without regard to the provisions of this Part of this Schedule except that in a case where this sub-paragraph would otherwise substitute a loss for a gain or a gain for a loss it shall be assumed, in relation to the disposal, that the relevant assets were sold by the owner, and immediately re-acquired by him, for a consideration such that, on the disposal, neither a gain nor a loss accrued to the person making the disposal.

(5) This paragraph shall not apply in relation to a disposal of shares or securities of a company by a person to whom those shares were issued as an employee either of the company or of some other person on terms which restrict his rights to dispose of them.

(6) For the purpose of—

(a) identifying shares or securities held on 6th April 1965 with shares previously acquired, and

(b) identifying the shares or securities held on that date with shares or securities subsequently disposed of, and distinguishing them from shares or securities acquired subsequently,

23.—(1) This paragraph shall apply in relation to a disposal of an asset which is land in die United Kingdom, or an estate or interest in land in the United Kingdom—

(a) if, but for this paragraph, the expenditure allowable as a deduction in computing under this Schedule the gain accruing on the disposal would include any expenditure incurred before 6th April 1965, and

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

571

(b) if the consideration for the asset acquired on the disposal Sch. 6 exceeds what its market value would be if, immediately before the disposal, it had become unlawful to carry out any development in, on or over the land other than development of the kinds specified in Schedule 3 to the Town and Country Planning Act 1962 (for land in England and Wales or 1962 c. 38. Northern Ireland) or Schedule 3 to the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1947 (for land in Scotland). 1947 c. 53.

In this sub-paragraph “ development ” has, in relation to land in England or Wales or Northern Ireland, the meaning given by the Town and Country Planning Act 1962 and, in relation to land in Scotland, the meaning given by the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1947.

(2) For the purposes of this Part of this Act, including Part I of this Schedule, it shall be assumed in relation to the disposal and, if it is a part disposal, in relation to any subsequent disposal of the asset which is land in the United Kingdom or an estate or interest in land in the United Kingdom that that asset was sold by the person making the disposal, and immediately re-acquired by him, at its market value on 6th April 1965.

(3) Sub-paragraph (2) above shall apply also in relation to any prior part disposal of the asset and, if tax has been charged, or relief allowed, by reference to that part disposal on a different footing, all such adjustments shall be made, whether by way of assessment or discharge or repayment of tax as are required to give effect to the provisions of this sub-paragraph.

(4) Sub-paragraph (2) above shall not apply in relation to a disposal of assets—

(a) if on the assumption in that sub-paragraph a gain would

accrue on that disposal to the person making the disposal and either a smaller gain or a loss would so accrue (computed in accordance with the provisions of Part I of this Schedule) if the said sub-paragraph (2) did not apply, or

(b) if on the assumption in the said sub-paragraph (2) a loss would so accrue and either a smaller loss or a gain would accrue if the said sub-paragraph (2) did not apply,

and accordingly the amount of the gain or loss accruing on the disposal shall be computed without regard to the provisions of this Part of this Schedule except that in a case where this sub-paragraph would otherwise substitute a loss for a gain or a gain for a loss it shall be assumed, in relation to the disposal, that the relevant assets were sold by the owner, and immediately re-acquired by him, for a consideration such that, on the disposal, neither a gain nor a loss accrued to the person making the disposal.

Apportionment by reference to straightline growth of gain or loss over period of ownership

24.—(1) This paragraph applies subject to the provisions of the last foregoing two paragraphs.

(2) On the disposal of assets by a person whose period of ownership began before 6th April 1965 only so much of any gain accruing

572

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

Sch. 6 on the disposal as is under this paragraph to be apportioned to the period beginning with 6th April 1965 shall be a chargeable gain.

(3) Subject to the following provisions of this Schedule, the gain shall be assumed to have grown at a uniform rate from nothing at the beginning of the period of ownership to its full amount at the time of the disposal so that, calling the part of that period before 6th April 1965 P, and the time beginning with 6th April 1965 and ending with the time of the disposal T, the fraction of the gain which

T

is a chargeable gain is p~+T

(4) If any of the expenditure which is allowable as a deduction in the computation under this Schedule of the gain is within paragraph 4(1X6) of this Schedule—

(a) the gain shall be attributed to the expenditure, if any,

allowable under paragraph (a) of the said paragraph 4(1) as one item of expenditure, and to the respective items of expenditure under the said paragraph 4(1X6) in proportion to the respective amounts of those items of expenditure,

(b) sub-paragraph (3) of this paragraph shall apply to the part of the gain attributed to the expenditure under the said paragraph 4(lXa),

(c) each part of the gain attributed to the items of expenditure under the said paragraph 4(1X6) shall be assumed to have grown at a uniform rate from nothing at the time when the relevant item of expenditure was first reflected in the value of the asset to the full amount of that part of the gain at the time of the disposal,

so that, calling the respective proportions of the gain E(0), E(l), E(2) and so on (so that they add up to unity) and calling the respective periods from the times when the items under the said paragraph 4(1X6) were reflected in the value of the asset to 5th April 1965 P(l), P(2) and so on, and employing also the abbreviations in sub-paragraph (3) above, the fraction of the gain which is

a chargeable gain is E(0)j~ +E(1) ~-pj, +E(2) j—pj, and so

on.

(5) In a case within sub-paragraph (4) above where there is no initial expenditure (that is no expenditure under paragraph 4(lX<z) of this Schedule) or that initial expenditure is, compared with any item of expenditure under paragraph 4(1X6), disproportionately small having regard to the value of the asset immediately before the subsequent item of expenditure was incurred, the part of the gain which is not attributable to the enhancement of the value of the asset due to any item of expenditure under the said paragraph 4(1X6) shall be deemed to be attributed to expenditure incurred at the beginning of the period of ownership and allowable under paragraph 4(1 Xa). and the part or parts of the gain attributable to expenditure under paragraph 4(1 )(6) shall be reduced accordingly.

(6) The beginning of the period ova- which a gain, or a part of a gain, is, under sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) above, to be treated as

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

573

growing shall not be earlier than 6th April 1945, and this sub-paragraph shall have effect notwithstanding any provision in this Schedule or elsewhere in this Part of this Act.

(7) If in pursuance of paragraph 7 in Part I of this Schedule an asset’s market value at a date before 6th April 1965 is to be ascertained sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) above shall have effect as if that asset had been on that date sold by the owner, and immediately re-acquired by him, at that market value.

(8) If m pursuance of the said paragraph 7 an asset’s market value at a date on or after 6th April 1965 is to be ascertained sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) above shall have effect as if—

(a) the asset on that date had been sold by the owner, and

immediately re-acquired by him, at that market value, and

(b) accordingly, the computation of any gain on a subsequent

disposal of that asset shall be computed—

(i) by apportioning in accordance with this paragraph the gain or loss over a period ending on the said date (the date of the part disposal), and

(ii) by bringing into account the entire gain or loss over the period from the date of the part disposal to the date of subsequent disposal.

(9) For the purposes of this paragraph the period of ownership of an asset shall, where under paragraph 8 of this Schedule account is to be taken of expenditure in respect of an asset from which the asset disposed of was derived, or where it would so apply if there were any relevant expenditure in respect of that other asset, include the period of ownership of that other asset

(10) If under this paragraph part only of a gain is a chargeable gain, the fraction in section 29(3) of this Act shall be applied to that part, instead of to the whole of the gain.

Election for valuation on 6th April 1965

25.—(1) If the person making a disposal so elects by notice in writing to the inspector within two years from the date of the disposal paragraph 24 of this Schedule shall not apply in relation to that disposal and it shall be assumed, both for the purposes of computing under this Schedule the gain accruing to that person on the disposal, and for all other purposes both in relation to that person and other persons, that the assets disposed of, and any assets of which account is to be taken in relation to the disposal under paragraph 8 of this Schedule, being assets which were in the ownership of the said person on 6th April 1965, were on that date sold, and immediately re-acquired, by him at their market value on the said 6th April 1965.

(2) Sub-paragraph (1) shall not apply in relation to a disposal of assets if on the assumption in that sub-paragraph a loss would accrue on that disposal to the person making the disposal and either a smaller loss or a gain would accrue if the said sub-paragraph (1) did

Sch. 6

574

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

Sch. 6 not apply, but in a case where this sub-paragraph would otherwise substitute a gain for a loss it shall be assumed, in relation to the disposal that the relevant assets were sold by the owner, and immediately re-acquired by him, for a consideration such that, on the disposal, neither a gain nor a loss accrued to the person making the disposal.

The displacement of sub-paragraph (1) above by this sub-paragraph shall not be taken as bringing paragraph 24 of this Schedule into operation.

(3) For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that an election under this paragraph is irrevocable.

(4) An election may not be made under this paragraph as respects, or in relation to, an asset the market value of which at a date on or after 6th April 1965, and before the date of the disposal to which the election relates, is to be ascertained in pursuance of paragraph 7 in Part 1 of this Schedule.

Shares, commodities, etc.

(3) For the purpose of—

(a) identifying the shares so held on 6th April 1965 with shares previously acquired, and

(b) identifying the shares so held on that date with shares subsequently disposed of, and distinguishing them from shares acquired subsequently,

so far as the shares are of the same class shares bought at an earlier time shall be deemed to have been disposed of before shares bought at a later time.

(4) Shares shall not be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as being of the same class unless if dealt with on a recognised stock exchange in the United Kingdom or elsewhere they would be so treated, but shall be treated in accordance with this paragraph notwithstanding that they are identified in a different way by a disposal or by the transfer or delivery giving effect to it.

(5) This paragraph shall not apply to any shares the disposal of which by the said person is chargeable to Case VII of Schedule D (that is to say where the acquisition and disposal of the shares by him is in circumstances such that a gain accruing from it is chargeable to income tax under Case VII of Schedule D or that, if a gain had so accrued, it would have been so chargeable), and for the purposes of this sub-paragraph the shares so disposed of shall be identified with shares acquired by that person as provided by para-

1962 c. 44. graph 8 of Schedule 9 to the Finance Act 1962.

(2) If, at any time after 5th April 1965, a person comes to have, in accordance with the said paragraph 4 as so extended, a new holding sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) of paragraph 24 of this Schedule shall have effect as if—

(a) the new holding had at that time been sold by the owner,

and immediately reacquired by him, at its market value at that time, and

(b) accordingly, the amount of any gain on a disposal of the new holding or any part of it shall be computed—

(i) by apportioning in accordance with the said paragraph 24 the gain or loss over a period ending at the said time, and

(ii) by bringing into account the entire gain or loss over the period from that time to the date of the disposal.

(3) This paragraph shall not apply in relation to a reorganisation of a company's share capital if the new holding differs only from the original shares in being a different number, whether greater or less, of shares of the same class as the original shares.

Capital allowances

(2) So far as the gain accruing to the said person on the disposal of the shares is attributable to a profit on the assets so transferred, the period over which the gain is to be treated under the said paragraph 24 as growing at a uniform rate shall begin with the time when the assets were transferred to the company, and accordingly a part of a gain attributable to a profit on assets transferred on or after 6th April 1965 shall all be a chargeable gain.

the option is part of the consideration for the sale, and

(b) if the option binds the grantor to buy, the consideration for the option shall be deducted from the cost of acquisition incurred by the grantor in buying in pursuance of his obligations under the option.

(3) The exercise or abandonment of an option by the person for the time being entitled to exercise it shall not constitute the disposal of an asset by that person, but, if an option is exercised then the acquisition of the option (whether directly from the grantor or not) and the transaction entered into by the person exercising the option in exercise of his rights under the option shall be treated as a single transaction and accordingly—

(a) if the option binds the grantor to sell, the cost of acquiring

the option shall be part of the cost of acquiring what is sold, and

(b) if the option binds the grantor to buy, the cost of the option shall be treated as a cost incidental to the disposal of what is bought by the grantor of the option.

(4) In relation to the disposal by way of transfer of an option binding the grantor to sell or buy shares or securities which have a quoted market value on a recognised stock exchange in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, the option shall be regarded as a wasting asset the life of which ends when the right to exercise the option ends, or when the option becomes valueless, whichever is the earlier, but without prejudice to the application of the provisions in Schedule 6 to this Act relating to wasting assets to other descriptions erf options.

(3) If, after a transaction which results in the owner of land or of any other description of property becoming the lessee of the property there is any adjustment of the rights and liabilities under the lease, whether or not involving the grant of a new lease, which is as a whole favourable to the lessor, that shall be a disposal by the lessee of an interest in the property.

(4) If an asset is subject to any description of right or restriction the extinction or abrogation, in whole or in part, of the right or restriction by the person entitled to enforce it shall be a disposal by him of the right or restriction.

(4) Where the asset mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) above is an option to enter into a sale or other transaction given by the person making the disposal a loss accruing to the person acquiring the asset shall not be an allowable loss unless it accrues on a disposal of the option at arm’s length to a person who is not connected with him.

(5) In a case where the asset mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) above is subject to any right or restriction enforceable by the person making the disposal, or by a person connected with him, then (the amount of the consideration for the acquisition being, in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, deemed to be equal to the market value of the asset) that market value shall be—

(a) what its market value would be if not subject to the right

or restriction, minus—

(b) the market value of the right or restriction or the amount by which its extinction would enhance the value of the asset to its owner, whichever is the less:

Provided that if the right or restriction is of such a nature that its enforcement would or might effectively destroy or substantially impair the value of the asset without bringing any countervailing advantage either to the person making the disposal or a person connected with him or is an option or other right to acquire the asset or, in the case of incorporeal property, is a right to extinguish the asset in the hands of the person giving the consideration by forfeiture or merger or otherwise, that market value of the asset shall be determined, and the amount of the gain accruing on the disposal shall be computed, as if the right or restriction did not exist.

(2) Where, under the terms subject to which a lease is granted, a sum becomes payable by the tenant in lieu of the whole or part of the rent for any period, or as consideration for the surrender of the lease, the lease shall be deemed for the purposes of this Schedule to have required the payment of a premium to the landlord (in addition to any other premium) of the amount of that sum for the period in relation to which the sum is payable.

(3) Where, as consideration for the variation or waiver of any of the terms of a lease, a sum becomes payable by the tenant otherwise than by way of rent, the lease shall be deemed for the purposes of this Schedule to have required the payment of a premium to the landlord (in addition to any other premium) of the amount of that sum for the period from the time when the variation or waiver takes effect to the time when it ceases to have effect

(4) If under sub-paragraph (2) or (3) above a premium is deemed to have been received by the landlord, otherwise than as consideration for the surrender of the lease, then subject to sub-paragraph (5) below, both the landlord and the tenant shall be treated as if that premium were, or were part of, the consideration for the grant of the lease due at the time when the lease was granted, and the gain accruing to the landlord on the disposal by way of grant of the lease shall be recomputed and any necessary adjustments of tax, whether by way of assessment for the year in which the premium is deemed to have been received, or by way of discharge or repayment of tax made accordingly.

(5) If under sub-paragraph (2) or (3) above a premium is deemed to have been received by the landlord, otherwise than as consideration for the surrender of the lease, and the landlord is a tenant under a lease the duration of which does not exceed fifty years this Schedule shall apply as if an amount equal to the amount of that premium deemed to have been received had been given by way of consideration for the grant of the part of the sub-lease covered by the period in respect of which the premium is deemed to have been paid as if that consideration were expenditure incurred by die sub-lessee and attributable to that part of the sub-lease under paragraph (4X1)(6) of Schedule 6 to this Act.

(6) Where under sub-paragraph (2) above a premium is deemed to have been received as consideration for the surrender of a lease the surrender of the lease shall not be the occasion of any recomputation of the gain accruing on the receipt of any other premium.

(2) Out of each item of the expenditure attributable to the lease under the said paragraph 4(1 )(a) and 4(1X6) there shall be apportioned to what is disposed of—

(a) if the amount of the premium is not less than what would

be obtainable by way of premium for the said sub-lease if the rent payable under that sub-lease were the same as the rent payable under the lease, the fraction which, under paragraph 1(3) of this Schedule, is to be written off over the period which is the duration of the sub-lease, and

(b) if the amount of the premium is less than the said amount so obtainable, the said fraction multiplied by a fraction equal to the amount of the said premium divided by the said amount so obtainable.

(3) If the sub-lease is a sub-lease of part only of the land comprised in the lease this paragraph shall apply only in relation to a proportion of the expenditure attributable to the lease under the said paragraph 4(1 )(o) and 4(1X6) which is the same as the proportion which the value of the land comprised in the sub-lease bears to the value of that and the other land comprised in the lease; and the remainder of that expenditure shall be apportioned to what remains undisposed of.

Exclusion of premiums taxed under Case VIII of Schedule D, etc.

5. —(1) Where by reference to any premium income tax has become chargeable under section 22 of the Finance Act 1963 on any amount, i%3 c. 25. that amount out of the premium shall be excluded from the consideration brought into account in the computation under paragraph 7

Provided that if what is disposed of is the remainder of a lease or a sub-lease out of a lease the duration of which does not exceed fifty years the foregoing provisions of this sub-paragraph shall not apply but the said amount shall be deducted from any gain accruing on the disposal as computed in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act apart from this sub-paragraph, but not so as to convert the gain into a loss, or to increase any loss.

(5) References in sub-paragraph (1) and (2) above to a premium include references to a premium deemed to have been received under subsection (3) or subsection (4) of section 22 of the Finance Act 1963 (which correspond to paragraph 3(2)(3) of this Schedule).

6.—(1) If under paragraph 9(1) of Schedule 4 to the Finance Act 1963 (allowance where, by the grant of a sub-lease, a lessee has converted a capital amount into a right to income) a person is to be treated as paying additional rent in consequence of having granted a sub-lease, the amount of any loss accruing to him on the disposal by way of the grant of the sub-lease shall be reduced by the total amount of rent which he is thereby treated as paying over the term of the sub-lease (and without regard to whether relief is thereby effectively given over the term of the sub-lease), but not so as to convert the loss into a gain, or to increase any gain.

(2) Nothing in paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to this Act shall be taken as applying in relation to any amount on which tax is paid under section 23 of the Finance Act 1963 (charge on assignment of lease granted at undervalue).

(3) If any adjustment is made under section 24(2X6) of the Finance Sch. 8 Act 1963 on a claim under that paragraph, any necessary adjust- 1963 c. 25 ment shall be made to give effect to the consequences of the claim on the operation of this or the last foregoing paragraph.

7. If under section 22(2) of the Finance Act 1963 income tax is chargeable on any amount, as being a premium the payment of which is deemed to be required by the lease, the person so chargeable shall be treated for the purposes of the computation of any gain accruing to him on a disposal of the lease as having incurred at the time the lease was granted expenditure of that amount (in addition to any other expenditure) attributable to the asset under paragraph 4(1X6) of Schedule 6 to this Act.

Terminable and renewable leases

8. In ascertaining for the purposes of this Schedule the duration of a lease of land, the following provisions shall have effect—

(a) where the terms of the lease include provision for the determination thereof by notice given either by the landlord or by the tenant, the lease shall not be treated as granted for a term longer than one ending at the earliest date on which it could be determined by notice;

(b) where any of the terms of the lease (whether relating to forfeiture or to any other matter) or any other circumstances render it unlikely that the lease will continue beyond a date falling before the expiration of the term of the lease, the lease shall not be treated as having been granted for a term longer than one ending on that date:

Provided that where the duration of a lease falls to be ascertained after a date on which the lease has for any reason come to an end, the duration shall be taken to have extended from its commencement to that date, and where the duration falls to be ascertained at a time when the lease is subsisting the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs shall be applied in accordance with circumstances prevailing at that time.

Leases of property other than land

9. —(1) Paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 8 of this Schedule shall apply in relation to leases of property other than land as they apply to leases of land, but subject to any necessary modifications.

(2) Where by reference to any capital sum within the meaning of section 17 of the Finance Act 1964 (leases of assets other than land) 1964 c. 49. any person has been charged to income tax on any amount, that amount out of the capital sum shall be deducted from any gain accruing on the disposal for which that capital sum is consideration,

as computed in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act apart from this sub-paragraph, but not so as to convert the gain into a loss, or increase any loss.

(3) In the case of a lease of a wasting asset which is movable property the lease shall be assumed to terminate not later than the end of the life of the wasting asset.

(2) If it appears after the end of any such year of assessment either—

(a) that in respect of distributions made by the company in the year the company is liable to account for income tax to an amount greater than the income tax (if any) borne by it on franked investment income received in the year and on any surplus of franked investment income carried forward to the year; or

(b) that in respect of payments made by the company in the year other than distributions the company is liable to account for income tax to an amount greater than the income tax (if any) borne by it by deduction on payments received in the year other than franked investment income;

and the amount paid by and not repaid to the company in respect of the year in accordance with sub-paragraph (1) above is less than the amount of the excess referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this sub-paragraph, the company shall be liable to pay the difference between the two last-mentioned amounts.

(3) The amount which a company is liable to pay for any year of assessment under sub-paragraph (2) above, if or in so far as it is not agreed between the company and the inspector or is not paid in pursuance of such an agreement, shall be recovered by means of an assessment made on the company.

(4) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule shall apply to income tax for which a company is liable to account under section 157

(pay as you earn) of the Income Tax Act 1952; but in section 27(1) 1952 c. 10. of the Finance Act 1960 (payments for interest on securities sold i960 c. 44 cum dividend) the reference to section 170(2) of the Income Tax Act 1952 shall include a reference to this Part of this Schedule.

(4) Income tax in respect of distributions included in a return, not being payments, shall be assessed on the company; and if it appears to the inspector that there are distributions (of whatever description) which ought to have been and have not been included in a return, or if the inspector is dissatisfied with any return, he may make an assessment on the company to the best of his judgment.

(5) Where a company is liable to pay income tax in respect of any payment if, but only if, it amounts to or involves a distribution, and it is not in the circumstances apparent whether or how far it does so, then—

under this paragraph; but

(b) sub-paragraph (3) above shall not apply to the payment and

income tax in respect of it shall be assessed as in the case of distributions other than payments.

(2) Sections 63 and 66 of the Income Tax Act 1952 (which make 1952 c. 10. special provision for Schedule D in relation to appeals and to the correction of mistakes) shall apply to any assessment made by virtue

of this Schedule as if it were an assessment under Schedule D, and section 13 of the Income Tax Management Act 1964 shall have effect accordingly.

(3) Section 495 of the Income Tax Act 1952 (interest on overdue income tax) shall apply in relation to income tax assessable in accordance with this Schedule as it applies to income tax charged by an assessment under Schedule D, except that subsection (2) and paragraph (a) of subsection (3) (remission of interest on tax less than three months overdue and on assessments for less than one thousand pounds) shall not apply.

(4) Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this Schedule shall be taken to prejudice any powers conferred by the Income Tax Acts for the recovery of income tax by means of an assessment or otherwise.

6. —(1) An election (that is to say in this Part of this Schedule, an election under section 48(3) of this Act) shall be made by notice in writing to the inspector, and the notice shall set out the facts necessary to show that the companies are entitled to make the election.

(2) An election shall not have effect in relation to dividends paid less than three months after the giving of the notice and before the inspector is satisfied that the election is validly made, and has so notified the companies concerned; but shall be of no effect if within those three months the inspector notifies the companies concerned that the validity of the dection is not established to his satisfaction:

Provided that the companies shall have the like right of appeal against any decision that the validity of the dection is not established as the company paying the dividends would have if it were an assessment made on that company under Schedule D, and the enactments relating to an appeal against such an assessment (including any enactment relating to the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court) shall apply accordingly.

(3) An dection shall cease to be in force if at any time the companies cease to be entitled to make the election, and on that happening each company shall forthwith notify the inspector.

(2) Section 48(3) shall not apply to dividends paid by a company to another unless both are bodies corporate.

8. Where a company purports by virtue of an election to pay any dividends without deduction of income tax, and income tax ought to have been deducted, then the company receiving the dividends shall be treated for purposes of sections 47 and 48 of this Act as if that tax had been deducted and been repaid to it under Part I of this Schedule, and the amount of that tax may be recovered from it accordingly by adjustment of the payments and repayments under Part I or otherwise.

9. —(1) For purposes of section 48(3) of this Act a body corporate shall be deemed to be a subsidiary of another body corporate if and so long as more than one half of its ordinary share capital is owned by that other body corporate, whether

SCHEDULE 13 Chargeable gains of companies Part I Groups of companies

Sections 55 and 82.

Interpretation

1. For purposes of this Part of this Schedule—

(a) references to a company apply only to a company resident

in the United Kingdom, and only to a company within the meaning of the Companies Act 1948 or the correspond- 1948 c. 49. ing enactment in force in Northern Ireland and to a registered industrial and provident society within the meaning of section 442 of the Income Tax Act 1952; 1952 c. 10.

(b) a principal company and all its subsidiaries form a group, and where a principal company is a member of a group as being itself a subsidiary, that group shall comprise all its subsidiaries;

(c) “subsidiary” has the meaning assigned to it for certain purposes of the profits tax by section 42 of the Finance Act 1938 except that in the application of that section any share

U 3

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

capital of a registered industrial and provident society shall be treated as within the definition of ordinary share capital, and “principal company” means a company of which another company is a subsidiary.

Transfers within the group

2.—(1) Notwithstanding any provision in Part III of this Act fixing the amount of the consideration deemed to be received on a disposal or given on an acquisition, where a member of a group of companies disposes of an asset to another member of the group, both members shall, except as provided by sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) below, be treated, so far as relates to corporation tax on chargeable gains, as if the asset acquired by the member to whom the disposal is made were acquired for a consideration of such amount as would secure that on the other's disposal neither a gain nor a loss would accrue to that other; but where it is assumed for any purpose that a member of a group of companies has sold or acquired an asset, it shall be assumed also that it was not a sale to or acquisition from another member of the group.

(2) Sub-paragraph (1) above shall not apply where the disposal is—

(a) a disposal of a debt due from a member of a group of

companies effected by satisfying the debt or part of it; or

(b) a disposal of redeemable shares in a company on the occasion of their redemption;

and the reference in that sub-paragraph to a member of a group of companies disposing of an asset shall not apply to anything which under Schedule 7 to this Act is to be treated as a disposal of an interest in shares in a company in consideration for a capital distribution (as defined in paragraph 3 of that Schedule) from that company, whether or not involving a reduction of capital.

(3) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) above, so far as the consideration for the disposal consists of money or money’s worth by way of compensation for any kind of damage or injury to assets, or for the destruction or dissipation of assets or for anything which depreciates or might depreciate an asset, the disposal shall be treated as being to the person who, whether as an insurer or otherwise, ultimately bears the burden of furnishing that consideration.

3.—(1) Where a member of a group of companies acquires an asset as trading stock from another member of the group, and the asset did not form part of the trading stock of any trade carried on by the other member, the member acquiring it shall be treated for purposes of paragraph 1 of Schedule 7 to this Act as having acquired the asset otherwise than as trading stock and immediately appropriated it for the purposes of the trade as trading stock.

(2) Where a member of a group of companies disposes of an asset to another member of the group, and the asset formed part

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

615

of the trading stock of a trade carried on by the member disposing Sch. 13

of it but is acquired by the other member otherwise than as trading

stock of a trade carried on by it, the member disposing of the asset

shall be treated for purposes of paragraph 1 of Schedule 7 to this

Act as having immediately before the disposal appropriated the

asset for some purpose other than the purpose of use as trading

stock.

Disposal or acquisition outside the group

4. Where a member of a group of companies disposes of an asset acquired from another member of the group, paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 to this Act shall apply in relation to any capital allowances made to the other member (so far as not taken into account in relation to a disposal of the asset by that other member), and so on as respects previous transfers of the asset between members of the group (but this shall not be taken as affecting the consideration for which an asset is deemed under paragraph 2(1) above to be acquired).

5. Part II of Schedule 6 to this Act shall apply in relation to a disposal of an asset by a member of a group of companies which acquired the asset from another member of the group, as if all members of the group for the time being were the same person, and as if the acquisition or provision of the asset by the group, so taken as a single person, had been the acquisition or provision of it by the member disposing of it.

6. For purposes of the provisions of this Act relating to capital gains tax in connection with the replacement of trade assets, all the trades carried on by members of a group of companies shall be treated as a single trade (unless it is a case of one member of the group acquiring, or acquiring the interest in, the new assets from another or disposing of, or of the interest in, the old assets to another).

Recovery of tax

7.—(1) If at any time a chargeable gain accrues to a company which at that time is a member of a group of companies and any of the corporation tax assessed on the company for the accounting period in which the chargeable gain accrues is not paid within six months from the date when it becomes payable by the company, then, if the tax so assessed included any amount in respect of chargeable gains,—

(a) a company which was at that time when the gain accrued the principal company of the group; and

(b) any other company which in any part of the period of two years ending with that time was a member of the said group of companies and owned the asset disposed of or any part of it, or where that asset is an interest or right in or over another asset, owned either asset or any part of either asset;

may at any time within two years from the time when the tax became payable be assessed and charged (in the name of the company

616

Ch. 25

Sch. 13 to whom the chargeable gain accrued) to an amount of that corporation tax not exceeding corporation tax on the amount of that gain at the rate in force when the gain accrued.

(2) A company paying any amount of tax under the foregoing sub-paragraph shall be entitled to recover a sum of that amount—

(a) from the company to which the capital gain accrued; or

(b) if that company is not the company which was the principal company of the group at the time when the capital gain accrued, from that principal company;

and a company paying any amount under paragraph ( )shall be entitled to recover a sum erf that amount from the company to which the capital gain accrued, and so far as it is not so recovered, to recover from any company which is for the time being a member of the group and which has while a member of the group owned the asset disposed of or any part of it (or where that asset is an interest or right in or over another asset, owned either asset or any part of it) such proportion of the amount unrecovered as is just having regard to the value of the asset at the time when the asset, or an interest or right in or over it, was disposed of by that company.

Part II

Recovery of Tax from Persons Receiving Distributions

8.—(1) This paragraph applies where a person who is connected with a company resident in the United Kingdom receives or becomes entitled to receive in respect of shares in the company any capital distribution from the company, other than a capital distribution representing a reduction of capital, and—

(a) the capital so distributed derives from the disposal of assets

in respect of which a chargeable gain accrues to the company; or

(b) the distribution constitutes such a disposal of assets.

(2) If the corporation tax assessed on the company for the accounting period in which the chargeable gain accrues included any amount in respect of chargeable gains, and any of the tax assessed on the company for that period is not paid within six months from the date when it becomes payable by the company, the said person may by an assessment made within two years from that date be assessed and charged (in the name of the company) to an amount of that corporation tax—

(a) not exceeding the amount or value of the capital distribution

which that person has received or become entitled to receive; and

(b) not exceeding a proportion equal to that person's share of the capital distribution made by the company of corporation

L; Qle

Finance Act 1965 Ch. 25

tax on the amount of that gain at the rate in force when the gain accrued.

(3) A person paying any amount of tax under this paragraph shall be entitled to recover a sum equal to that amount from the company.

(4) The provisions of this paragraph are without prejudice to any liability of the person receiving or becoming entitled to receive the capital distribution in respect of a chargeable gain accruing to him by reference to the capital distribution as constituting a disposal of an interest in shares in the company.

(2) Where in the year 1965-66 a company is entitled to claim relief under section 341 of the Income Tax Act 1952 in respect of any loss (including any amount treated as a loss under section 20 of the Finance Act 1954), the company may claim that such part, if any, of that loss as cannot be relieved against income tax for that year shall be deducted or set off against profits arising in the year 1965-66, otherwise than from any trade carried on by the company, being profits in respect of which the company would otherwise be chargeable to corporation tax, and in so far as the loss arose in the year 1965-66 and cannot be so deducted or set off against profits arising in that year, that it shall be deducted from or set off against any such profits so arising in the year 1966-67; and up to the amount of the deduction or set off those profits shall be excluded accordingly from any assessment to corporation tax (the relief in any year of assessment being given as far as may be against profits of an earlier, rather than the profits of a later, accounting period).

(3) Relief in respect of the same matter shall not be given both in a manner authorised under this paragraph and in some other manner.

21. —(1) Where a company has before the year 1966-67 incurred a loss in a trade carried on by it, such part, if any, of that loss as but for this Act might have been carried forward to that year under section 342 of the Income Tax Act 1952 may be dealt with under section 58(1) or (7) of this Act as if it were a loss incurred by the company while within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the trade, but incurred in an accounting period ending at the time when the company in fact comes within the charge to tax in respect of the trade.

(2) This paragraph shall apply to any amount which by virtue Sch. 15 of section 345 of the Income Tax Act 1952, or of paragraph 3 of 1952 c. 10. Schedule 3 to the Finance Act 1954, might be dealt with under 1954 c. 44. section 342 as a loss incurred by a company in a trade as if that amount were a loss so incurred; but where section 345 applies by virtue of section 443(1X£) of that Act to any amount of share interest or loan interest paid by a registered industrial and provident society, this sub-paragraph shall not have effect except m relation to so much of the said amount as represents share interest or loan interest paid before the society comes within the charge to corporation tax in respect of its trade.

Losses within Case VI

Expenses of management

23. —(1) No deduction shall be made under section 57 of this Act (or under that section as applied by section 69) in respect of sums disbursed as expenses of management in or before the year 1965-66, or in respect of any amounts which are by virtue of any enactment to be treated as sums so disbursed, in so far as relief can be given in respect thereof under section 425 of the Income Tax Act 1952 or under that section as applied by any other enactment; but in so far as relief cannot be so given, the amount unrelieved shall be treated for purposes of section 57 or 69 of this Act as an amount disbursed as expenses of management for the first accounting period for which the company is within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the business.

(2) Where sub-paragraph (1) above has effect the company may by notice in writing given not later than twelve months after the end of the accounting period specified in the notice elect to treat such an amount of sums disbursed as expenses of management as is specified in the notice (being an amount not exceeding the total of the sums so disbursed in the said accounting period) as an amount unrelieved for the purpose of sub-paragraph (1), and where such a notice is given the amount so treated shall not be available for relief under section 425 of the Income Tax Act 1952.

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

Sch. IS

1954 c. 44.

within the charge to corporation tax in respect erf it, section 59 of this Act shall apply, with any necessary adaptations, so as to enable relief to be given under that section against income tax for years of assessment before 1966-67 in so far as relief cannot be given against corporation tax, but so that—

(a) where relief is given against income tax, section 18(4) of

the Finance Act 1954 shall apply as it applies in relation to the corresponding relief under that section; and

(b) where section 59 of this Act has effect by virtue of this paragraph to reduce the profits of any period and income tax for more than one year of assessment has been computed wholly or partly by reference to those profits, such adjustment shall be made as may be necessary to prevent relief being given more than once.

(2) Where sub-paragraph (1) above has effect, and before the year 1966-67 there has been in the trade a relevant change within the meaning of Schedule 3 to the Finance Act 1954 (company reconstructions), section 59 of this Act and that sub-paragraph shall apply so as to enable a person carrying on the trade before the relevant change to be given relief in the like circumstances and to the like extent, as nearly as may be, as he might have been given relief under section 18 of the Finance Act 1954 by virtue of paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 to that Act.

Continuation of elections .

25.—(1) Where before the year 1966-67 a company has for purposes of income tax made any election or done any other act of a description which—

(a) would have had continuing effect for income tax for that

year or, if revocable, would have had continuing effect unless revoked;

(b) may also be made for corporation tax;

then that election or act shall for corporation tax be valid and effectual as if duly made or done for that tax, and have effect from the beginning of the first accounting period for which the company is within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the matter in question.

(2) Accordingly where any such election or act is required to be made or done, if at all, at a particular time, no provision of this Act amending the enactment under which it is made or done so as to specify a different time in relation to corporation tax (whether by substituting a reference to the first accounting period for a reference to the first year of assessment in which anything takes place, or otherwise) shall be taken, unless the contrary intention appears, to invalidate any election or act duly made or done nor, where the time has passed for making or doing it for income tax, to extend the time in relation to corporation tax; but nothing in this paragraph shall take away any right of revocation or variation.

Finance Act 1965

Ch. 25

641

(2) Holdings of shares, securities or rights which differ in the entitlements or obligations they confer or impose shall be regarded as holdings of different classes.

(3) References to a holding in a company shall not apply, unless the contrary intention appears, to a holding consisting of shares which satisfy the following conditions: —

(a) that they are fully paid and do not carry any right to divi-

dends other than dividends at a rate per cent, of the nominal value of the shares which is fixed or fluctuates only with the standard rate of income tax; and

(b) that the rights which they carry in respect of dividends and capital are comparable with those general for fixed-dividend shares quoted on stock exchanges in the United Kingdom; and

(c) that no part of the share capital represented by the shares

has at any time been treated as paid up otherwise than by the receipt by the company of new consideration.

(4) Sub-paragraph (3) above shall not operate in relation to any acquisition of such a holding as is there mentioned if either—

(a) at the time of that acquisition dividends on the shares were

more than twelve months in arrear and would or might become payable thereafter; or

(b) as a sequel to or in contemplation of that acquisition or any related acquisition of a holding in the company (but before the making of the distribution which is in question under the principal section) there has been any alteration of the rights attached to the shares or, so as materially to affect those rights or the operation of those rights, any alteration of the rights attached to or comprised in holdings of any other class in the company.

For purposes of this sub-paragraph two trades shall be regarded as under the same control if they are carried on by persons one of whom is a body of persons over whom the other has control (within the meaning assigned to that expression by section 333 of the Income Tax Act 1952), or both of whom are bodies of persons under the control (as so defined) of a third person; and for this purpose “ body of persons ” includes a partnership.

(3) A holding acquired in right of another holding shall be included under sub-paragraph (2)(a) above where that other holding would be so included; and for this purpose holdings acquired in pursuance of an offer or invitation made in respect of any holdings in the company and restricted to the holders thereof shall be treated as acquired in right of their holdings.

Time of acquisition

4.—(1) A person having more than one holding of the same class in a company and selling or otherwise disposing of a part only shall be regarded as selling or disposing of a holding or part of a holding acquired earlier rather than one acquired later.

(2) Where at the time when a dealer’s trade is set up and commenced (or is to be treated in computing the trading income for corporation tax or income tax as set up and commenced) a holding is included in the trading stock, or profits from a sale of it would otherwise form part of the trading profits, the holding shall be regarded as having been acquired at that time; but where there is a change in the persons engaged in carrying on a trade, and a new trade is not on that change to be so treated as set up and commenced, the principal section shall apply to the person so engaged after the change as if there had been done to or by him anything done to or by his predecessor since the time when the trade was set up and commenced (or is to be so treated as having been set up and commenced).

(3) A company acquiring from another company (neither of them being a dealer) a holding in a third company at a time when the three companies are associated shall, for the purpose of determining how far, if at all, a distribution made in respect of the holding is made out of profits arising to the third company since the acquisition, be treated as having acquired the holding at the time when that other company acquired it (or, if this sub-paragraph applies also to that acquisition, is to be treated as having acquired it) or at the time, if it is later, when the said three companies became associated.

For this purpose “ associated ” means as regards two companies, that one is a subsidiary of the other or both are subsidiaries of a third company and, as regards three or more companies, that one is associated with each of the others; and a company shall be deemed to be a subsidiary of another if (within the meaning of section 42 of the Finance Act 1938) more than one-half of its ordinary share capital is owned by that other, whether directly or through one or more bodies corporate or partly directly and partly through one or more bodies corporate.

5. —(1) Subject to paragraph 7 below, the question how far a distribution made in respect of a holding of any class is to be treated as made out of profits arising to the company since the time when the holding was acquired shall be determined by taking the profits arising to the company since that time and seeing what proportion of that distribution and the distributions made with it on other holdings of the same class can be met out of those profits, after allowing for previous distributions made since that time on holdings of that class and for distributions made or not yet made on holdings not of that class (including any such holdings as are described in paragraph 2(3) above); and for this purpose there shall be treated as included in any distribution or part of a distribution the income tax thereon for which the company is liable to account under this Act.

(2) The allowance to be made under sub-paragraph (1) above for previous distributions made since the time there referred to on holdings of the same class is the amount which, in the case of those distributions, is treated under that sub-paragraph as made out of the profits arising to the company since that time.

(3) The allowance to be made under sub-paragraph (1) above for distributions on holdings not of the class in question shall be such amount, whether fixed or proportionate to the amount of the profits, as ought justly and reasonably to be set aside for making such distributions, having regard to the respective rights comprised in or attaching to holdings in the company, and on the assumption that the total amount available for distributions by the company over any period will be proportionately greater or less than the profits taken into account under sub-paragraph (1) above, according as that period is longer or shorter than the period so taken into account; and regard may be had to the fact (if it is so) that distributions for which allowance is to be made under this sub-paragraph have been treated for purposes of the principal section as paid wholly or partly out of profits arising before the period so taken into account.

6. —(1) For purposes of paragraph 5 above, the profits arising to a company in the period between a person's acquisition of a holding and the making of a distribution on the holding shall be arrived at by ascertaining in accordance with the following sub-paragraphs the profits or loss for any accounting period wholly or partly comprised in that period and, where necessary, by the division and aggregation or apportionment of the profits or losses so ascertained.

(2) Except as provided by sub-paragraph (3) below, the profits for any accounting period shall be ascertained according to the rules applicable under Part IV of this Act to the computation for corporation tax of the total profits of the company (losses of any description except those related to chargeable gains being deducted from profits of any description), except that—

(a) franked investment income and group income shall be included; and

(b) no regard shall be had—

(i) to any investment allowances, initial allowances or balancing charges, to any scientific research allowance in

respect of expenditure incurred after 5th November 1962 or to so much of any writing down allowance made at a rate determined under section 38 or 39 of the Finance Act 1963 (free depreciation in development districts) or under section 14 of this Act as exceeds an allowance at a yearly rate of fifteen per cent, of the relevant amount of expenditure; or

(ii) to any deduction falling to be made in respect of losses, allowances or expenses of management of any other period, except any deduction falling to be made against chargeable gains in respect of losses incurred before the accounting period; or

(iii) to any restriction on the deduction that may be made for directors* remuneration;

(c) there shall be deducted—

(i) any charges on income; and

(ii) the corporation tax payable by the company in respect of the accounting period and any surtax paid by it in that period under section 249 of the Income Tax Act 1952 as applied by the provisions of Part IV of this Act about close companies.

This sub-paragraph shall apply for ascertaining a loss sustained by a company in an accounting period as it applies for ascertaining the profits of a company for an accounting period.

(3) Where a company has a holding in another body corporate resident in the United Kingdom, and—

(a) that holding was acquired by it before the recipient acquired his holding in the company; and

(b) on the assumption that the company’s holding and any other relevant holdings in the body corporate were acquired when the recipient acquired his holding in the company, the company’s holding in the body corporate would be treated for purposes of the principal section as amounting to, or being an ingredient in a holding amounting to, ten per cent, of all holdings of the same class in die body corporate;

then any distribution made to the company in respect of that holding shall be brought into account under sub-paragraph (2) above only to the extent to which it would, on the said assumption, be treated under this Schedule as made out of profits arising to the body corporate since the time when the holding was acquired:

Provided that this sub-paragraph shall not apply to a distribution which, on the said assumption, would fall within subsection (8) of the principal section.

Transitional

7.—(1) For the application of section 4 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1955 to dividends paid before the year 1966-67 the profits or gains arising in any period from a trade shall, notwithstanding that those profits or gains are within the charge to corporation tax, be computed in accordance with paragraph 5(2X<z) of Schedule 3 to that Act as if they were within the charge to income tax.

(2) As regards distributions made in or after the year 1966*67 in respect of holdings acquired before that year,—

(a) paragraphs 5 and 6(1) and (2) above shall be applied in

relation to the period beginning with that year, as if the acquisition had been made at the beginning of that year, and paragraph 6(3) shall not apply; but

(b) as regards the period before the beginning^ of that year there shall be ascertained, as if for purposes of section 4 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1955, whether there were profits of the company arising since the date of the acquisition and available at the beginning of that year for payment of the distribution or, if not, whether the company had incurred a loss between the date of the acquisition and the beginning of that year, and any such profits or loss shall be brought into account under paragraph 6(2) above by adding the amount of the profits or deducting the amount of the loss in the computation for the accounting period or part of an accounting period ending first after the beginning of that year.

8.—(1) As respects dividends paid before the year 1966-67 section 4 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1955 shall have effect for corporation tax notwithstanding the exclusion from the charge to corporation tax of distributions received from companies resident in the United Kingdom; and any other enactment operating by reference to the said section 4 shall apply accordingly.

(2) Where—

(a) a company carries on a trade other than such a trade as is mentioned in subsection (1) of section 4 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1955; or

(b) the business of a company consists wholly or mainly in the making of investments;

and in the year 1965-66 the company receives a dividend the net amount of which would, if the company carried on such a trade as is mentioned in the said subsection (1), be required to any extent to be brought into account for tax purposes as a trading receipt which has not borne tax, then so much of the said net amount as would have been required to be brought into account as aforesaid shall for the purpose of corporation tax in respect of chargeable gains be treated as if it were a capital distribution (within the meaning of Part III of this Act) received in respect of the stock or shares on which the dividend is paid, and to that extent paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 6 to this Act shall not apply thereto.

Company paying dividends within the group

(b) by aggregating the share capital of the company in any I>eriod with that of the companies which are from time to time its subsidiaries in that period, but excluding any share capital which is directly owned by any of the companies concerned (and disregarding any share capital so owned in the application of subsection (8X«) and (b) of the principal section); and

(a) there shall be excluded dividends paid by one of the com

panies concerned to another; and

(b) from the aggregate dividends paid by the subsidiaries other-

wise than to any of the companies concerned there shall be deducted the amounts (if any) which under the principal section the subsidiaries are treated as paying in the year 1966-67;

(a) in respect of any amount taken into account by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) above as income in the base year there shall be treated as allowed credit for foreign tax equal to the income tax and profits tax treated by virtue of that sub-paragraph as charged in respect of it; and

(b) in arriving for any year of assessment at the adjusted aggregate amount in the related period of the unused credit for foreign tax, the unused credit for foreign tax in respect of the income from each overseas source of trading income shall be computed as if the foreign tax were 56£ per cent.

Groups of companies and associated companies

3.—(1) Where a company claiming relief for any year of assessment is a member of a group of companies, and in claiming the relief elects that this paragraph shall have effect in relation to a member of the group specified in the claim, then for the purposes of that claim the provisions of the principal section shall be modified in accordance with this paragraph.

(b) there shall be taken into account in the case of the company as if it were its income charged to corporation tax, and as if it were its income so charged from overseas sources of trading income having an unused credit for foreign tax, the appropriate fraction of the amounts respectively falling to be taken into account as such in the case of the other member of the group, and there shall on the like principles be set against income of the company the appropriate fraction of any loss incurred by die other member of the group in a trade carried on by it so far as that loss is not taken into account as reducing the income of the other member.

(5) In applying this paragraph to a company and another member of a group of companies, account shall be taken of the operation of sub-paragraphs (2) to (4) above in relation to the other member in determining what, if any, relief might be given to the other member (or, if the other member does not claim relief for the year of assessment, then of the operation which this sub-paragraph would have on a claim by it containing an election duly made under this paragraph in relation to such companies as may be specified in this behalf in the company’s claim); and for this purpose any amount falling by virtue of sub-paragraph (4Xa) above to be treated as income tax deducted or deductible from dividends paid by the other member shall be apportioned rateably between those dividends.

(6) For the purposes of this paragraph “ the appropriate fraction ” in relation to a company and to another member of the same group of companies is the fraction proportionate to the interest of the company in that other member, but for this purpose the company shall be treated as not being the owner of any share capital which it owns directly or indirectly in a third company if the other member and the third company are also members together of any group of companies; and, subject to sub-paragraph (5) above, “ relief (before abatement)” means the full amount of the relief calculated in accordance with subsection (1) of the principal section apart from any reduction under the proviso to that subsection or under any later subsection, but references to relief before abatement in respect of dividends paid without deduction of income tax are references to the relief calculated apart only from any reduction under that proviso or in respect of dividends so paid.

(a) to any allowance or charge falling to be made in taxing the trade (within the meaning of Schedule 14 to this Act); or

(b) to any restriction on the deductions that may be made for directors’ remuneration.

(3) In determining what the taxed income from the trade would

have been if die company had ceased to possess the trade as a source of income at the end of the year 1965-66 the computation shall be made, if need be, by division and apportionment or aggregation of income for accounting periods, including any period extending beyond the end of that year, and without regard to the operation of any enactment which would affect the computation on an actual discontinuance of the trade except section 130(1) of the Income Tax 1952 c. 10. Act 1952, with any enactment amending it, and (when a subvention payment is in question) section 20(7) of the Finance Act 1953. 1953 c. 34.

(4) Where the taxed income referred to in subsection (1) of the principal section (whether the actual income or the income as on a cessation) falls to be ascertained partly by reference to a period in which the company incurred a loss in the trade, that income shall be ascertained as if there had been no such loss (nor any income) in that period; but in ascertaining for purposes of subsection (2X6) the taxed income for any period losses incurred in that period and any part of a loss apportionable to that period shall be deducted from income.

3.—(1) If a company on ceasing at any time to possess a trade as a source of income continues to carry on any of the activities of the trade as activities of another trade, the company shall be disentitled as at that time to such part of the allowance in respect of the first-mentioned trade as is referable to those activities.

the company shall be disentitled as from that time to the allowance in respect of the first-mentioned trade:

Provided that where this sub-paragraph applies by reason only of part of the trade or part of its activities being carried on by an associated company the company shall be so disentitled only to such part of the allowance as is referable to that part of the trade or activities.

(3) Where a company ceases at any time to carry on part of a trade, and within two years after that time that part of the trade or the activities of it are carried on by an associated company as its trade or part of its trade, the company shall be treated as having been, as from that time, disentitled to such part of any allowance in respect of the trade as is referable to that part of the trade or those activities.

664

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1965

Sch. 21 (4) Where by reason of a company carrying on a trade or part

of a trade, or carrying on any activities in the course of a trade, that company or another company becomes disentitled to an allowance or part of an allowance, the allowance shall attach or remain attached to that trade (whether or not in the year 1965-66 that trade was being carried on by that company or at all).

(5) Where under sub-paragraph (4) above an allowance or part of an allowance in respect of a trade attaches to another trade, the allowance or that part of it shall, except as regards amount, be treated for all purposes as an allowance in respect of the trade, but the amount shall not be affected except as follows: —

(6) For purposes of this paragraph the part of an allowance referable to any part of a trade or to any activities of a trade shall be determined, in relation to an event occurring at any time, by taking the amount of the allowance (as if on the company ceasing at that time to possess the trade as a source of income) and by apportioning that amount between that part or those activities of the trade and the remainder, according to the proportions in which the taxed income of the company from the trade is attributable thereto during the period of three years ending with that event (or any less period during which the company has carried on the trade), or, if there is no such taxed income, then by apportioning it in such other manner as may in the circumstances be just; but for determining the part of the allowance which is attached to a trade after that event the amount of the allowance shall be taken without regard to paragraph (b) of or the proviso to subsection (2) of the principal section.

(7) Where under this paragraph a company becomes disentitled to an allowance or part of an allowance after the allowance or that part of it has been given to it or to another company, the allowance or part so given shall be withdrawn to the extent necessary to give effect to this paragraph.

(8) For purposes of this paragraph, a company is to be treated as another’s “ associated company '* at a given time if at that time, or at any time within one year before or two years afterwards, one of the two has control of the other or both are under the control of the same person or persons (“ control ” having for this purpose the same meaning as in Schedule 18 to this Act).

The carrier shall then hold the goods on behalf of the person so entitled. He may however entrust them to a third party, and in that case he shall not be under any liability except for the exercise of reasonable care in the choice of such third party. The charges due under the consignment note and all other expenses shall remain chargeable against the goods.

3. The carrier may sell the goods, without awaiting instructions from the person entitled to dispose of them, if the goods are perishable or their condition warrants such a course, or when the storage expenses would be out of proportion to the value of the goods. He may also proceed to the sale of the goods in other cases if after the expiry of a reasonable period he has not received from the person entitled to dispose of the goods instructions to the contrary which he may reasonably be required to carry out.

4. If the goods have been sold pursuant to this article, the proceeds of sale, after deduction of the expenses chargeable against the goods, shall be placed at the disposal of the person entitled to dispose of the goods. If these charges exceed the proceeds of sale, the carrier shall be entitled to the difference.

5. The procedure in the case of sale shall be determined by the law or custom of the place where the goods are situated.

1. The carrier shall be liable for the total or partial loss of the goods and for damage thereto occurring between the time when he takes over the goods and the time of delivery, as well as for any delay in delivery.

2. The carrier shall however be relieved of liability if the loss, damage or delay was caused by the wrongful act or neglect of the claimant, by the instructions of the claimant given otherwise than

Carriage of Goods by Road Act 1965

Ch. 37

827

as the result of a wrongful act or neglect on the part of the carrier, by inherent vice of the goods or through circumstances which the carrier could not avoid and the consequences of which he was unable to prevent.

3. The carrier shall not be relieved of liability by reason of the defective condition of the vehicle used by him in order to perform the carriage, or by reason of the wrongful act or neglect of the person from whom he may have hired the vehicle or of the agents or servants of the latter.

4. Subject to article 18, paragraphs 2 to 5, the carrier shall be relieved of liability when the loss or damage arises from the special risks inherent in one or more of the following circumstances:

(a) Use of open unsheeted vehicles, when their use has been

expressly agreed and specified in the consignment note;

(b) the lack of, or defective condition of packing in the case of goods which, by their nature, are liable to wastage or to be damaged when not packed or when not properly packed;

(c) handling, loading, stowage or unloading of the goods by

the sender, the consignee or persons acting on behalf of the sender or the consignee;

(d) the nature of certain kinds of goods which particularly exposes them to total or partial loss or to damage, especially through breakage, rust, decay, desiccation, leakage, normal wastage, or the action of moth or vermin;

(e) insufficiency or inadequacy of marks or numbers on the

packages;

(/) the carriage of livestock.

5. Where under this article the carrier is not under any liability in respect of some of the factors causing the loss, damage or delay, he shall only be liable to the extent that those factors for which he is liable under this article have contributed to the loss, damage or delay.

Article 18

1. The burden of proving that loss, damage or delay was due to one of the causes specified in article 17, paragraph 2, shall rest upon the carrier.

2. When the carrier establishes that in the circumstances of the case, the loss or damage could be attributed to one or more of the special risks referred to in article 17, paragraph 4, it shall be presumed that it was so caused. The claimant shall however be entitled to prove that the loss or damage was not, in fact, attributable either wholly or partly to one of these risks.

3. This presumption shall not apply in the circumstances set out in article 17, paragraph 4(a), if there has been an abnormal shortage, or a loss of any package.

828

Ch. 37

Carriage of Goods by Road Act 1965

4. If the carriage is performed in vehicles specially equipped to protect the goods from the effects of heat, cold, variations in temperature or the humidity of the air, the carrier shall not be entitled to claim the benefit of article 17, paragraph unless he proves that all steps incumbent on him in the circumstances with respect to the choice, maintenance and use of such equipment were taken and that he complied with any special instructions issued to him.

5. The carrier shall not be entitled to claim the benefit of article 17, paragraph 4(f), unless he proves that all steps normally incumbent on him in the circumstances were taken and that he complied with any special instructions issued to him.

Delay in delivery shall be said to occur when the goods have not been delivered within the agreed time-limit or when, failing an agreed time-limit, the actual duration of the carriage having regard to the circumstances of the case, and in particular, in the case of partial loads, the time required for making up a complete load in the normal way, exceeds the time it would be reasonable to allow a diligent carrier.

Article 20

1. The fact that goods have not been delivered within thirty days following the expiry of the agreed time-limit, or, if there is no agreed time-limit, within sixty days from the time when the carrier took over the goods, shall be conclusive evidence of the loss of the goods, and the person entitled to make a claim may thereupon treat them as lost.

2. The person so entitled may, on receipt of compensation for the missing goods, request in writing that he shall be notified immediately should the goods be recovered in the course of the year following the payment of compensation. He shall be given a written acknowledgment of such request.

3. Within the thirty days following receipt of such notification, the person entitled as aforesaid may require the goods to be delivered to him against payment of the charges shown to be due on the consignment note and also against refund of the compensation he received less any charges included therein but without prejudice to any claims to compensation for delay in delivery under article 23 and, where applicable, article 26.

4. In the absence of the request mentioned in paragraph 2 or of any instructions given within the period of thirty days specified in paragraph 3, or if the goods are not recovered until more than one year after the payment of compensation, the carrier shall be entitled to deal with them in accordance with the law of the place where the goods are situated.

2. Goods of a dangerous nature which, in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, the carrier did not know were dangerous, may, at any time or place, be unloaded, destroyed or rendered harmless by the carrier without compensation; further, the sender shall be liable for all expenses, loss or damage arising out of their handing over for carriage or of their carriage.

Article 23

1. When, under the provisions of this Convention, a carrier is liable for compensation in respect of total or partial loss of goods, such compensation shall be calculated by reference to the value of the goods at the place and time at which they were accepted for carriage.

2. The value of the goods shall be fixed according to the commodity exchange price or, if there is no such price, according to the current market price or, if there is no commodity exchange price or current market price, by reference to the normal value of goods of the same kind and quality.

3. Compensation shall not, however, exceed 25 francs per kilogram of gross weight short. “ Franc ” means the gold franc weighing 10/31 of a gramme and being of millesimal fineness 900.

4. In addition, the carriage charges. Customs duties and other charges incurred in respect of the carriage of the goods shall be refunded in full in case of total loss and in proportion to the loss sustained in case of partial loss, but no further damages shall be payable.

6. Higher compensation may only be claimed where the value of the goods or a special interest in delivery has been declared in accordance with articles 24 and 26.

Article 24

The sender may, against payment of a surcharge to be agreed upon, declare in the consignment note a value for the goods exceeding the limit laid down in article 23, paragraph 3, and in that case the amount of the declared value shall be substituted for that limit

1. In case of damage, the carrier shall be liable for the amount by which the goods have diminished in value, calculated by reference to the value of the goods fixed in accordance with article 23, paragraphs 1, 2 and 4.

(a) if the whole consignment has been damaged the amount payable in the case of total loss;

(b) if part only of the consignment has been damaged, the amount payable in the case of loss of the part affected.

Article 26

1. The sender may, against payment of a surcharge to be agreed upon, fix the amount of a special interest in delivery in the case of loss or damage or of the agreed time-limit being exceeded, by entering such amount in the consignment note.

Article 27

1. The claimant shall be entitled to claim interest on compensation payable. Such interest, calculated at five per centum per annum, shall accrue from the date on which the claim was sent in writing to the carrier or, if no such claim has been made, from the date on which legal proceedings were instituted.

2. When the amounts on which the calculation of the compensation is based are not expressed in the currency of the country in which payment is claimed, conversion shall be at the rate of exchange applicable on the day and at the place of payment of compensation.

Article 28

1. In cases where, under the law applicable, loss, damage or delay arising out of carriage under this Convention gives rise to an extra-contractual claim, the carrier may avail himself of the provisions of this Convention which exclude his liability or which fix or limit the compensation due.

2. In cases where the extra-contractual liability for loss, damage or delay of one of the persons for whom the carrier is responsible under the terms of article 3 is in issue, such person may also avail himself of the provisions of this Convention which exclude the liability of the carrier or which fix or limit the compensation due.

Article 29

1. The carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this chapter which exclude or limit his liability or

Carriage of Goods by Road Act 1965

Ch. 37

2. The same provision shall apply if the wilful misconduct or default is committed by the agents or servants of the carrier or by any other persons of whose services he makes use for the performance of the carriage, when such agents, servants or other persons are acting within the scope of their employment. Furthermore, in such a case such agents, servants or other persons shall not be entitled to avail themselves, with regard to their personal liability, of the provisions of this chapter referred to in paragraph 1.

In the case of loss or damage which is not apparent the reservations referred to shall be made in writing.

2. When the condition of the goods has been duly checked by the consignee and the carrier, evidence contradicting the result of this checking shall only be admissible in the case of loss or damage which is not apparent and provided that the consignee has duly sent reservations in writing to the carrier within seven days, Sundays and public holidays excepted, from the date of checking.

3. No compensation shall be payable for delay in delivery unless a reservation has been sent in writing to the carrier, within twenty-one days from the time that the goods were placed at the disposal of the consignee.

4. In calculating the time-limits provided for in this Article the date of delivery, or the date of checking, or the date when the goods were placed at the disposal of the consignee, as the case may be, shall not be included.

5. The carrier and the consignee shall give each other every reasonable facility for making the requisite investigations and checks.

(b) the place where the goods were taken over by the carrier or the place designated for delivery is situated,

and in no other courts or tribunals.

2. Where in respect of a claim referred to in paragraph 1 of this article an action is pending before a court or tribunal competent under that paragraph, or where in respect of such a claim a judgment has been entered by such a court or tribunal no new action shall be started between the same parties on the same grounds unless the judgment of the court or tribunal before which the first action was brought is not enforceable in the country in which the fresh proceedings are brought

3. When a judgment entered by a court or tribunal of a contracting country in any such action as is referred to in paragraph 1 of this article has become enforceable in that country, it shall also become enforceable in each of the other contracting States, as soon as the formalities required in the country concerned have been complied with. The formalities shall not permit the merits of the case to be reopened.

4. The provisions of paragraph 3 of this article shall apply to judgments after trial, judgments by default and settlements confirmed by an order of the court, but shall not apply to interim judgments or to awards of damages, in addition to costs against a plaintiff who wholly or partly fails in his action.

5. Security for costs shall not be required in proceedings arising out of carriage under this Convention from nationals of contracting countries resident or having their place of business in one of those countries.

Article 32

1. The period of limitation for an action arising out of carriage under this Convention shall be one year. Nevertheless, in the case of wilful misconduct, or such default as in accordance with the law of the court or tribunal seised of the case, is considered as equivalent to wilful misconduct, the period of limitation shall be three years. The period of limitation shall begin to run:

(a) in the case of partial loss, damage or delay in delivery, from the date of delivery;

(b) in the case of total loss, from the thirtieth day after the expiry of the agreed time-limit or where there is no agreed time-limit from the sixtieth day from the date on which the goods were taken over by the carrier;

(c) in all other cases, on the expiry of a period of three months after the making of the contract of carriage.

The day on which the period of limitation begins to run shall not be included in the period.

Carriage of Goods by Road Act 1965

Ch. 37

833

2. A written claim shall suspend the period of limitation until such date as the carrier rejects the claim by notification in writing and returns the documents attached thereto. If a part of the claim is admitted the period of limitation shall start to run again only in respect of that part of the claim still in dispute. The burden of proof of the receipt of the claim, or of the reply and of the return of the documents, shall rest with the party relying upon these facts. The running of the period of limitation shall not be suspended by further claims having the same object

3. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 above, the extension of the period of limitation shall be governed by the law of the court or tribunal seised of the case. That law shall also govern the fresh accrual of rights of action.

4. A right of action which has become barred by lapse of time may not be exercised by way of counter-claim or set-off.

Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965

Extension of principal Act in relation to supply of services.

(3) A reference of a matter to the Commission under section 2 of the principal Act may (so far as relates to the conditions to be taken into account) be so framed as to exclude from consideration, or to limit consideration to, conditions which prevail or may prevail by virtue of arrangements or practices, or any specified arrangements or practices, falling within section 3(2) or 5(2) or (3) of that Act (which relate to arrangements and practices preventing or restricting competition), whether or not the reference is also so framed as to limit the investigation and report to the facts.

(4) If a person makes default in complying with a notice under section 8(3) of the principal Act (under which the Commission may require the attendance of witnesses or production of documents etc.) die court may, on the application of the Board of Trade, make such order as the court thinks fit for requiring the default to be made good; and any such order may provide that all the costs of and incidental to the application shall be borne by the person in default or by any officers of a company or other association who are responsible for its default.

Amendments relating to monopoly situations

2.—(1) Section 2(1 )(b) of the principal Act (which authorises references to the Commission about the application of any process to goods of any description) shall extend also to the supply of services of any other description; and for this purpose “ the supply of services ” shall include the undertaking and performance by way of business of engagements for any matter other than die supply of goods and shall include both the rendering of services to order and the provision of services by making them available to potential users, but shall not include the rendering of services under a contract of service.

(2) Accordingly in the provisions of the principal Act other than the said section 2(1 )(b)and sections 3 to 5 (which define, in relation to the several types of reference to the Commission, the conditions to which the Act applies)—

(a) for any reference to the application of a process to goods of any description there shall be substituted a reference to the supply of services of any description; and

(b) the expression “ goods ”, where it is used of the goods to

which a reference or potential reference to the Commission relates or might relate, shall include services.

(3) Section 4 of the principal Act shall cease to have effect, and for the purposes of that Act conditions to which that Act applies shall be deemed to prevail as respects the supply of services of any description if either—

Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965

Ch. 50

931

extent of at least one-third, by or for any one person, or by or for any two or more persons being interconnected bodies corporate, or by or for any such two or more persons as are described in subsection

(4) below; or

(b) any agreements or arrangements (whether legally enforceable or not) are in operation the result of which is that, in the United Kingdom or any substantial part thereof, services of that description are not supplied at all;

and accordingly section 20(3) of the principal Act (which gives the Board of Trade and the Commission a discretion as to the criteria to be applied in estimating quantities of goods supplied, processed or produced) shall have effect in relation to services supplied as it has effect in relation to goods supplied.

(4) The two or more persons referred to in subsection (3)(a) above are any two or more persons who, whether voluntarily or not, and whether by agreement or arrangement or not, so conduct their respective affairs as in any way to prevent or restrict competition in connection with the supply of services of the description in question (whether or not they themselves are affected by the competition and whether the competition is between persons interested as persons by whom, or as persons for whom, services are supplied):

Provided that, in considering whether or not any two or more persons so conduct their affairs as aforesaid, practices as to the workers to be employed or not to be employed by them or as to the remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of workers, or any class of workers, so employed shall be left out of account.

(5) For purposes of this section—

(a) services may, in such cases and to such extent as the

Board of Trade or the Commission think appropriate in the circumstances, be treated as supplied at any place at which the person supplying them has a place of business, or from which the relevant activities are controlled, or in which the body corporate supplying them is incorporated, and may be so treated whether or not they would otherwise be regarded as supplied in the United Kingdom; and

(b) section 3(3) of the principal Act (which enables different forms of supply of goods to be considered separately or in separate groups) shall have effect in relation to services and to subsections (3) and (4) above as it has effect in relation to goods and to subsections (1) and (2) of that section; and

(3) The Board of Trade may by order made by statutory instrument provide that the value mentioned in subsection (l)(h)(ii) above shall be varied, or, if a previous order has been made under this subsection, further varied, by such amount as may be specified in the order, but, where an order under this subsection is made after the reference of a matter to the Commission, then, in the case of that reference, in determining under subsection (2) above whether subsection (l)(h) above is satisfied, the variation made by the order shall be disregarded.

A statutory instrument containing an order under this subsection shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament

(4) A reference under this section may (so far as relates to the investigation and report on the facts) be so framed as to exclude from consideration either sub-paragraph (i) or sub-paragraph (ii) of subsection (1)(&) above, or to exclude it from consideration if the Commission find the other satisfied; and as regards sub-paragraph i) the reference may be so framed as to require the Commission to confine their investigation to the supply of goods or services in a specified part of the United Kingdom.

the Commission to pay the expense of furnishing them with certain documents and information) for the reference to conditions to which the principal Act applies not prevailing there shall be substituted a reference to subsection (l)(u) and (b) above not being satisfied; and

(c) in section 9 (which exempts from the obligation (hereby

imposed on the Board of Trade to lay a report of the Commission before Parliament a case where the reference was so framed as to limit the investigation and report to the facts) for the exemption of that case there shall be substituted the exemption of a case where the Commission find that subsection (l)(a) and (b) above are not satisfied.

(6) Where a reference is made to the Commission under this section, it shall be the duty of the Commission to make their report on the matter referred within such period, not exceeding six months, from the date on which the reference is

940

Ch. 50

Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965

made as may be specified by the Board of Trade in the reference or within such further time, not exceeding three months, as the Board of Trade may allow; but the Board shall not extend the time beyond the period specified in the reference except on representations made to them by the Commission and on being satisfied that there are special reasons why the report cannot be made within the period so specified, and if a report is made after the time allowed by this subsection, it shall not be published and no further proceedings shall be taken on it.

(7) Where it appears to the Board of Trade that it is or may be the fact that arrangements are in progress or con-templation which, if carried into effect, will result in subsection

(l)(fl) and (b) above being satisfied, die Board may refer the matter to the Commission, and the Commission shall proceed accordingly in relation to the prospective and (if events so require) the actual results of the arrangements proposed or made as they might proceed in relation to the results of arrangements made immediately before the reference:

Provided that if it appears to the Commission in the course of their investigation that the making of any such arrangements has been abandoned, they shall, if the Board of Trade consent, lay the reference aside, but furnish the Board with such information as the Board may require as to the results till then of the investigation.

(8) In determining whether to refer a matter to the Commission under this section, the Board shall have regard, with a view to the prevention or removal of uncertainty, to the need for making a determination as soon as is reasonably practicable.

(9) Where it appears to the Board of Trade that it is or may be the fact that two or more enterprises have ceased to be distinct enterprises more than six months previously, but done so under or in consequence of arrangements or transactions entered into without prior notice being given to the Board of the material facts about the proposed arrangements or transactions and without those facts being so published as to be generally known or readily ascertainable, then subsection (l)(a) above shall apply with the substitution of the condition that the Board had notice of those facts or the facts were so published not earlier than six months previously for the condition that the enterprises ceased to be distinct enterprises not earlier than that time.

(10) Where according to a report of the Commission under this section as laid before Parliament actual or prospective results of the facts found by the Commission operate or may be expected to operate against the public interest, section 3 of this Act shall apply as it applies in the circumstances described in section 10(1) of the principal Act.

01) Where a reference is made to the Commission under this section, the Board of Trade, with a view to preventing action which may prejudice the reference or may impede the taking, under section 3 of this Act as applied by subsection (10) above, of any remedial action which may be warranted by the Commission’s report, may exercise any powers conferred by section 3(5) or (7) of this Act as if the Commission had reported as mentioned in subsection (10) above and the Board of Trade had under consideration the making of an order under section 3(6).

(12) Section 3(H)(6) of this Act shall not apply to an order made by virtue of subsection (11) above; and any such order—

(a) shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolu-

tion of either House of Parliament; and

(b) shall cease to have effect (but without prejudice to

anything previously done thereunder) forty days after the Commission’s report is laid before Parliament, in so far as the order then remains in force and has not been continued by a further order made under section 3 of this Act, or at the expiration of the time allowed for the Commission to make their report without their having made it.

(13) This section shall apply in relation to enterprises ceasing to be distinct enterprises before, as well as after, the commencement of this Act; but the Board of Trade shall not refer to the Commission under this section the case of any enterprises ceasing to be distinct enterprises where it appears to the Board that their doing so is the result of an agreement entered into before the 3rd March 1965, or entered into by the acceptance on or after that date of an offer made before that date, or is the result of the exercise of rights conferred by such an agreement, and subsection (l)(a) above shall not be treated as satisfied in relation to enterprises ceasing to be distinct enterprises in those circumstances.

7.—(1) Section 6 of this Act shall be construed and have effect Application subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(2) For purposes of section 6 “ enterprise ” means the activities about mergers, or any part of the activities of a trade or business; and two enterprises are to be treated as ceasing to be distinct enterprises

if at any time they are brought under common ownership or control (whether or not the trade or business to which either of them formerly belonged continues to be carried on under the same or different ownership or control) or if either enterprise ceases to be carried on at all and does so under or in consequence of any arrangements or transaction entered into to prevent or restrict competition between the enterprises.

(3) For purposes of subsection (2) above the following enterprises shall be treated as carried on under common control

2G*3

942

Ch. 50

Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965

(without prejudice to the generality of that expression) that is to say,—

(a) the enterprises of interconnected bodies corporate;

(b) the enterprises carried on by any two or more bodies

corporate of which the same person or group of persons has control;

(c) any enterprise carried on by a body corporate and any

enterprise carried on by a person or group of persons having control of that body corporate.

(4) Section 3 of this Act, as applied by section 6, shall have effect as if, in subsection (5), the reference to bodies corporate becoming interconnected bodies corporate included a reference to enterprises being brought under common control otherwise than by reason of their becoming enterprises of interconnected bodies corporate, and to enterprises ceasing to be carried on as mentioned in subsection (2) above, and, in subsection (6), the reference to the division of a trade or business as therein mentioned included a reference to the separation, by the sale of any part of any undertaking or assets concerned or other means, of enterprises which are under common control otherwise than by reason of their being enterprises of interconnected bodies corporate.

(5) For purposes of section 6 a person or group of persons able, directly or indirectly, to control or materially to influence the policy of a body corporate, or the policy of any person in carrying on an enterprise, may without having a controlling interest in the body corporate or enterprise be treated as having control of it, but so that (if the other circumstances allow) enterprises may be treated as ceasing to be distinct enterprises—

(a) where a person or group of persons already able to control or materially to influence the policy of a body corporate or of a person carrying on an enterprise acquires a controlling interest in that body or enterprise; or

(b) where a person or group of persons already able materially to influence the policy of a body corporate or of such a person becomes able to control that policy.

(6) Subject to subsection (7) below, the time at which any two enterprises cease to be distinct enterprises, where they do so under or in consequence of any arrangements or transaction not having immediate effect, or having immediate effect in part only, shall be taken to be the time when the parties to the arrangements or transaction become bound to such extent as will result, on effect being given to their obligations, in the enterprises ceasing to be distinct enterprises; and accordingly (but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) no account shall

Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965

Ch. 50

943

for this purpose be taken of any option or other conditional right until the exercise of the option or satisfaction of the condition.

(7) Where under or in consequence of any arrangements or transaction, or of successive arrangements or transactions between the same parties or interests, any enterprises successively cease to be distinct enterprises, then (subject to section 6(13)) for the purposes of any reference under section 6 any of the enterprises so ceasing within a period not exceeding two years may, if the Board of Trade see fit, be treated as so ceasing simultaneously at the latest date on which any of them do so; and this subsection shall apply also, with the necessary adaptations, for the purposes of section 6(7) in relation to enterprises which will or may cease to be distinct enterprises under or in consequence of arrangements not yet carried into effect or not yet fully carried into effect.

For purposes of this subsection any arrangements or transactions may be treated by the Board of Trade or the Commission as arrangements or transactions between the same interests if it appears appropriate that they should be so treated having regard to the persons who are substantially concerned therein.

(8) For purposes of section 6(l)(£>)(ii) the value of the assets taken over is to be determined (subject to subsection (9) below) by taking the total value of the assets employed in or appropriated to the enterprises ceasing to be distinct enterprises, except any enterprise which remains under the same ownership and control or, if none of the enterprises remains under the same ownership and control, then that one of the enterprises having the assets with the highest value; and the value is to be determined by reference to the values at which, on the enterprises ceasing to be distinct enterprises or (if they have not then done so) on the making of the reference to the Commission, the assets stand in the books of the relevant trade or business less any relevant provisions for depreciation, renewals or diminution in value.

For purposes of this subsection any assets of a body corporate which, on a change in the control of the body corporate or any enterprise of it, are dealt with in the same way as assets appropriated to any such enterprise shall be treated as appropriated to that enterprise.

(9) Where the scope of a reference is extended under subsection (7) above, subsection (8) shall apply with such adjustments as appear to the Board of Trade or, as the case may be, the Commission to be appropriate.

(10) In considering for the purposes of section 6(2) above whether the fact of enterprises having ceased to be distinct enterprises operates or may be expected to operate against the

Provided that (without prejudice to section 6 of this Act)—

The Board of Trade shall not extend the time allowed for making the report beyond the three months of the matter being referred, except on representations made by the Commission and on being satisfied that there are special reasons why the report cannot be made within the three months.

(4) On a reference under this section sections 7 to 9 of the principal Act shall apply with the following modifications: —

(a) section 7(2) shall not apply, but the Commission, if it

(b) in section 8(4), the proviso (which restricts the power

of the Commission to pay the expense of furnishing them with certain documents and information) shall not apply;

any purported transfer thereof without the required consent; or

person who is knowingly concerned in or privy to any breach of the condition; shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for not more than two years or to a fine or to both:

tion of a newspaper, other than a transfer made without a view to a change in the ownership or control of the newspaper or to its ceasing publication;

and in subsection (1) above, any reference to average circulation per day of publication is a reference, in relation to a newspaper, to such average circulation for the appropriate period ascertained by dividing the number of copies to which the circulation of the newspaper amounts for that period by the number of days on which the newspaper is published during that period, circulation being calculated on the basis of actual sales in the United Kingdom of the newspaper as published on those days; and for the purposes of this subsection “ appropriate period ” means—

(i) in a case in which an application for consent is made,

In this subsection “ control ” shall be construed in accordance with section 7(5) of this Act, except that for purposes of paragraph (c) it shall mean “ have a controlling interest in ” (within the meaning of section 8(7) of this Act).

(2) Subsection (1) above shall not apply for any purpose referred to in subsection (1)(6) or (c) so as to exclude from the operation of section 6 or 8 of this Act any case otherwise falling within it; and where a reference is made to the Commission under section 6 of this Act, then (whether or not it could have been made apart from this section) it may be so framed, or may be so varied, as to exclude from consideration, either altogether or for any specified purpose or to any specified extent, any matter which would not have been taken into account apart from this section.

3. Subject to the provisions of this Act—

(a) every employed person of any description set out in column 1 of Part I of Schedule 1 to this Act shall be liable to pay weekly contributions at the rate set out in relation to that description—

Ch. 51

959

(ii) if his employment is a non-participating employment, in column 3 of the said Part I;

(b) every employer of an employed person of any descrip-

tion set out in column 1 of Part II of the said Schedule 1. or of any person of any such description who is to be treated by virtue of the said Part II as an employed person, shall be liable to pay weekly contributions in respect of that person at the rate set out in relation to that description—

(i) unless that person’s employment is a nonparticipating employment, in column 2 of the said Part II; or

(ii) if that person’s employment is a nonparticipating employment, in column 3 of the said Part II;

(c) every self-employed person of any description set out in

column 1 of Part III of the said Schedule 1 shall be liable to pay weekly contributions at the rate set out in relation to that description in column 2 of the said Part III;

in column 1 of Part IV of the said Schedule 1 shall be liable to pay weekly contributions at the rate set out in relation to that description in column 2 of the said Part IV.

4.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, where in any income tax week there is made to or for the benefit of a person over the age of eighteen a payment on account of his remuneration in any one employment of an amount exceeding nine pounds (or the equivalent amount for remuneration not paid weekly), then if the employment was an employed contributor’s employment and is not at the time of the payment a non-participating employment and that person either is under pensionable age or has not retired from regular employment—

(a) he shall be liable to pay a graduated contribution based

on that payment; and

(b) his employer in the employment shall be liable to pay

such a contribution in respect of him; and

(c) the amount of the graduated contribution payable by

each of them shall be four and a quarter per cent, of the amount, up to nine pounds, by which that payment exceeds nine pounds (or of the equivalent amount for remuneration not paid weekly).

(2) In relation to graduated contributions, references in this Act to remuneration shall be taken to include, and to include

Part I

Graduated contributions by employed persons and employers.

960

Ch. 51

National Insurance Act 1965

Part I only, any emoluments assessable to income tax under Schedule E (other than pensions), being emoluments from which tax under that Schedule is deductible, but shall apply to a payment of any such remuneration whether or not tax in fact falls to be deducted from that payment.

(3) Except in so far as regulations otherwise provide, the graduated contributions payable in any income tax week in respect of a person’s remuneration shall be determined—

(a) by aggregating, and treating as a single payment of remuneration in one employment, all payments made in that week on account of remuneration in the same employment, or in any two or more employments under the same employer, except any employment such that graduated contributions are not payable in respect of it;

(b) by apportioning between the employments any single payment of remuneration in two or more employments under different employers, and (subject to the foregoing paragraph) treating as separate payments the parts apportioned to each employment.

(4) Where a person in any income tax year is paid remuneration from two or more employments, and the graduated contributions paid by him in respect of that remuneration exceed the prescribed amount, the excess—

(a) shall for the purposes of the powers conferred by sec-

tion 14 of this Act be treated as representing contributions of the wrong class paid in error; and

(b) shall for the purpose of any right under this Act to

benefit be treated as not properly payable.

(5) For the purpose of graduated contributions, any sums deducted (whether for contributions, for income tax or otherwise) from any payment of remuneration which is or would but for the deduction be made shall, except in so far as regulations otherwise provide, be treated as paid on account of the remuneration; and for the purpose aforesaid any payment of remuneration shall be disregarded in so far as it is directed by regulations to be treated as coming from sums comprised in a previous payment of remuneration or to be otherwise excluded from the computation of a person’s remuneration.

(6) Provision shall be made by regulations for determining the graduated contributions payable where the whole or part of a person’s remuneration in any employment is not paid weekly (and accordingly for determining the equivalent amounts mentioned in subsection (1) of this section), and may include provision for modifying subsection (3) of this section; and

National Insurance Act 1965

Ch. 51

961

regulations may also, for the purpose of graduated contributions, make provision as to the intervals at which a person’s remuneration or any part of it is to be treated as paid where it is not all paid at the same intervals of a week or longer and in the amounts due for those or for corresponding intervals.

(7) Regulations may also in relation to graduated contributions make provision—

(a) for calculating the amounts payable according to a prescribed scale or otherwise adjusting them so as to avoid fractional amounts or otherwise facilitate computation; and

(b) for requiring that the liability in respect of a payment made in an income tax week, in so far as it depends on any conditions as to a person’s age or retirement, shall be determined as at the beginning of the week or as at the end of it; and

(c) for securing that liability is not avoided or reduced by an employer following in the payment of persons employed any practice which is abnormal for their employments.

5.—(1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, in each of the three years 1970, 1975 and 1980 the rates of contribution payable by insured persons and employers shall be increased (for that and subsequent years) as follows: —

(a) beginning with the first Monday in April—

(i) an addition of fivepence per week shall be made to the rate of each contribution payable under section 3(a)(i) or (b)(i) of this Act or payable by a boy or girl under the age of eighteen under section 3(c) or (d) of this Act; and

(ii) an addition of tenpence per week shall be made to the rate of any other contribution payable under the said section 3; and

(b) beginning with 6th April, an addition of a quarter per

cent, shall be made to the rate at which graduated contributions are calculated on the relevant amount of remuneration.

(2) If the Minister with the consent of the Treasury by order so directs, the foregoing subsection shall have effect in relation to the increases to be made in any of the three years specified therein with the substitution for the references to fivepence, to tenpence and to a quarter of references to any less amounts specified by the order.

(2) Contributions payable in accordance with any order under this section shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be contributions payable in accordance with the relevant provisions of the said section 3 and Schedule 1.

7. —(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, there shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, in such manner and at such times as the Treasury may determine, for each of the following contributions, being contributions under section 3 of this Act, the amount (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ the Exchequer supplement ”) hereinafter respectively specified, that is to say—

description set out in column 1 of Part I of Schedule 1 to this Act, an amount equal to one quarter of the contribution for the time being set out in relation to that description in column 2 of the said Part I;

(b) for each contribution as the employer of an employed

person of any description set out in column 1 of Part II of the said Schedule 1, or of any person of any such description who is to be treated by virtue of the said Part II as an employed person, an amount equal to one quarter of the contribution for the time being set out in relation to that description in column 2 of the said Part II;

(c) for each contribution as a self-employed or non-

employed person, an amount equal to one third of the contribution,

so, however, that the aggregate amount paid in any financial year for the Exchequer supplements in respect of contributions paid in that year shall not be less than one hundred and seventy million pounds.

(2) For the purposes of the foregoing subsection, the number of contributions of any class paid in any period shall be estimated in such manner as the Treasury may determine.

(b) no such deduction may be made of any contribution

not yet paid except where it is not payable until after the date when the said wages or remuneration are paid.

13) Where the wages or other pecuniary remuneration of an insured person are paid at calendar monthly intervals, then, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, it shall be lawful for the employer, at his option, to recover from each such payment of wages or remuneration, in lieu of the amount authorised to be recovered by him in accordance with the said provisions, an amount equal to one-twelfth of the contributions paid or to be paid by the employer on behalf of the insured person during the calendar year:

Provided that—

(a) where the employment commences after the beginning, or is to be terminated before the end, of a calendar year, the contributions paid or to be paid by the employer on behalf of the insured person during the calendar year shall be calculated for the purpose of ascertaining the said fraction of one-twelfth as though the employment continued throughout that year;

(b) in calculating the said fraction of one-twelfth, fractions

of a penny may be disregarded;

(c) such adjustment (whether by way of repayment or

increased or reduced deduction or otherwise) as may be necessary to secure that the amounts which have been recovered in accordance with this subsection are, when so adjusted, equal to the amounts which could have been recovered in accordance with the said subsection (2) shall be made between the employer and the insured person—

(i) on the termination of the employment, that is to say, subject to paragraph (d) of this proviso, on the day on which the employment actually comes to an end, whether the termination is in accordance with the terms of the contract or not and whether or not employment is to be resumed at a later date;

(iii) at intervals of not more than one year during the employment;

(d) for the purposes of this subsection, an employment in relation to which—

(i) the employer begins, or ceases, to recover amounts in accordance with this subsection; or

(ii) contributions on behalf of the insured person cease to be payable or become payable at a different rate,

shall be treated as commencing, or terminating, upon that event.

(4) The amount of any contribution not yet paid shall not be recoverable except under and in accordance with subsection

(2) or (3) of this section; and if any person contravenes or fails to comply with subsection (2) or paragraph (a) or (c) of the proviso to subsection (3) of this section, he shall for each offence be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten pounds or, where the offence consists of continuing such a contravention or failure after conviction thereof, ten pounds together with a further ten pounds for each day on which it is so continued.

(5) Where the insured person does not receive any wages or other pecuniary remuneration from the employer but receives such remuneration from some other person, the amount of any contribution paid by the employer on behalf of the insured person shall (without prejudice to any other means of recovery) be recoverable from the insured person summarily as a civil debt if proceedings for the purpose are instituted within three months from the date on which the contribution was payable.

(6) Where the insured person does not receive any wages or other pecuniary remuneration in respect of an employed contributor’s employment either from his employer or from any other person, the employer shall be liable to pay the contributions payable both by himself and the insured person and shall not be entitled to recover any part thereof from the insured person.

(7) Regulations with respect to such recovery as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section may make provision additional to that made by this section and may vary or revoke any of the provisions of this section other than subsection (6) and so much of subsection (2) as precedes the proviso thereto.

(d) for treating contributions of the wrong class or at the wrong rate as paid on account of the contributions properly payable or on account of contributions under the Industrial Injuries Act, and for treating contributions under that Act which were not payable as paid on account of contributions under this Act, notwithstanding anything in that Act;

tunity of suitable employment;

National Insurance Act 1965

Part n (5) For the purposes of this section, employment shall not be deemed to be employment suitable in the case of any person if it is either—

(a) employment in a situation vacant in consequence of a

stoppage of work due to a trade dispute; or

(c) employment in his usual occupation in any other district

at a rate of remuneration lower, or on conditions less favourable, than those generally observed in that district by agreement between associations of employers and of employees, or, failing any such agreement, than those generally recognised in that district by good employers;

but, after the lapse of such an interval from the date on which he becomes unemployed as in the circumstances of the case is reasonable, employment shall not be deemed to be unsuitable by reason only dial it is employment of a kind other than employment in his usual occupation if it is employment at a rate of remuneration not lower, and on conditions not less favourable, than those generally observed by agreement between associations of employers and of employees or, failing any such agreement, than those generally recognised by good employers.

(6) In this section—

(3) Subject to paragraph 13 of Schedule 11 to this Act, where a person is in any income tax year employed both in a nonparticipating employment and in another employed contributor's employment, then any question as to the amount (if any) by which the graduated contributions paid by him in respect of remuneration paid in that year exceed the amount prescribed under section 4(4) of this Act shall be determined as if (in addition to those contributions) on the first day of any contribution week in which he was employed in a non-participating employment he had paid a graduated contribution in respect of a weekly payment of remuneration of eighteen pounds made on that day:

Provided that if he is treated under section 58 of this Act as having on any such day paid a graduated contribution or part of one, this subsection shall treat him as paying on that day only such contribution (if any) as is necessary in order to make up the amount he is treated as having paid to that of such a graduated contribution as aforesaid.

and for the cancellation, variation or surrender of any certificate part in or issue of an amended certificate on any change of circumstances affecting the treatment of an employment as a nonparticipating employment, and (subject to the exclusion by subsection (1) of this section of persons under the age of eighteen or over pensionable age) any such certificate for the time being in force shall be conclusive that the employments included in it are non-participating employments:

Provided that—

(a) except in such circumstances as may be prescribed, no

such certificate or cancellation, surrender or variation of such a certificate shall have effect from a date earlier than the beginning of the contribution week following that in which it is issued or made; and

(b) subject to the provisions of this Act, an employment

otherwise satisfying die conditions for inclusion in such a certificate shall be so included if and so long as the employer so elects, and not otherwise.

Part m treated as a non-participating employment in relation to the persons from time to time so employed or any of them, a person’s service shall be treated as qualifying him for such pension benefits, as, in the existing circumstances, can reasonably be expected to accrue to him from a period of service of appropriate length, on the assumption that he remains in an employment qualifying him for those benefits until pensionable age (or as near to that age as the terms of the employment allow) but no longer.

(3) In determining whether an employment can be treated as a non-participating employment in a case where a limit on the maximum amount of the benefits payable or any description of them operates to prevent service beyond a given length from qualifying a person for further benefits, the qualification arising from any period of service shall be determined on the assumption that the total service does not exceed that length.

(4) Any scheme or arrangement having for its object or one of its objects to make provision in respect of persons serving in particular employments for providing them with retirement benefits by way of pension shall be a recognised superannuation scheme for the purposes of this Part of this Act—

(c) his service in the previous employment is service qualifying him for equivalent pension benefits under die recognised superannuation scheme relating to his new employment (on the like assumptions as are to be made under section 57(2) and (3) of this Act in relation to his service in the new employment); and

(d) if the scheme is a recognised superannuation scheme

by virtue of paragraph (b) of section 57(4) of this Act, the conditions of that paragraph are satisfied in relation to the said benefits,

then for the purpose of any liability to make a payment in lieu of contributions in respect of him the two employments shall be treated as a single continuous employment (any interval being disregarded):

Provided that the amount recoverable shall not exceed the amount of the refund, or so much of it as has not been made.

(2) Where the period taken into account in fixing the amount of a payment does not coincide with that in respect of which the refund is to be made, then (subject to subsection (3) of this section) the amount recoverable under this section shall be determined by reference to so much of the payment and of the refund as are referable to the same period.

(3) The amount which may be recovered under this section in respect of any payment in lieu of contributions shall be increased by such amount as may be prescribed where—

(b) a payment in lieu of contributions falls to be made in

respect of him, and under the said section 59(4) his service in the two employments is treated as service in one employment in fixing that payment,

then in respect of that payment the person liable for it shall have the like right of recovery from that refund (so far as the payment is not recoverable out of a refund in respect of a later employment) as a person has under the foregoing provisions of this section where a payment in lieu of contributions and a refund fall to be made on the coming to an end of service in the employment in respect of which the refund is to be made; and subsection (5) of this section shall apply accordingly.

1.—(1) Where a person has received on account of benefit or a family allowance sums to which, by virtue of any provision of, or of regulations under, this Act or the Industrial Injuries Act or by virtue of section 11(6) of the Family Allowances Act, he was disentitled by reason of his being entitled by virtue of a subsequent award to other benefit or, as the case may be, to guardian’s allowance under section 29 of this Act, then, except in so far as regulations otherwise provide, the decision making that subsequent award shall direct that those sums shall be treated as having been paid on account of the benefit thereby awarded.

(2) Where on review or appeal a decision awarding a person benefit is revised, or is reversed or varied, but he retains any sums paid in pursuance of the original decision which would not have been payable if the decision on the review or appeal had been given in the first instance, then, except in so far as regulations otherwise provide, any decision awarding him other benefit or a family allowance,

Section 12.

SCHEDULE 4 ASSESSMENT OF EXTENT OF DISABLEMENT

1. For the purposes of section 12 of this Act, the extent of disablement shall be assessed, by reference to the disabilities incurred by the claimant as a result of the relevant loss of faculty, in accordance with the following general principles: —

(a) save as hereafter provided in this paragraph, the disabilities

to be taken into account shall be all disabilities (whether or not involving loss of earning power or additional expense) to which the claimant may be expected, having regard to his physical and mental condition at the date of the assessment, to be subject during the period taken into account by the assessment as compared with a person of the same age and sex whose physical and mental condition is normal;

(b) any such disability shall be treated as having been incurred as a result of the relevant loss of faculty except that, subject to the provisions of any regulations made under paragraph 2 of this Schedule, it shall not be so treated in so far as the claimant either—

(i) would in any case have been subject thereto as the result of a congenital defect or of an injury or disease received or contracted before the relevant accident; or

(ii) would not have been subject thereto but for some injury or disease received or contracted after, and not directly attributable to, that accident;

(c) the assessment shall be made without reference to the

particular circumstances of the claimant other than age. sex, and physical and mental condition;

(d) the disabilities resulting from such loss of faculty as may be prescribed shall be taken as amounting to one hundred per cent disablement and other disabilities shall be assessed accordingly.

2. Provision may be made by regulations for further defining the principles on which the extent of disablement is to be assessed and such regulations may in particular direct that a prescribed loss of faculty shall be treated as resulting in a prescribed degree of disablement; and, in connection with any such direction, nothing in paragraph 1(c) of this Schedule shall be taken to prevent the making of different provision, in the case of loss of faculty in or affecting hand or arm, for right-handed and for left-handed persons.

3. The period to be taken into account by an assessment of the extent of a claimant’s disablement shall be the period (beginning not earlier than the end of the injury benefit period, and limited by reference either to the claimant’s life or to a definite date) during which the claimant has suffered and may be expected to continue to suffer from the relevant loss of faculty:

National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act Ch. 52

1163

Provided (hat if on any assessment (he condition of the claimant Sch. 4 is not such, having regard to the possibility of changes therein (whether predictable or not), as to allow of a final assessment being made up to the end of the said period—

(a) a provisional assessment shall be made, taking into account

such shorter period only as seems reasonable having regard to his condition and the possibility aforesaid; and

(b) on the next assessment the period to be taken into account shall begin with the end of the period taken into account by the provisional assessment.

4. An assessment shall state the degree of disablement in the form of a percentage and shall also specify the period taken into account thereby and, where that period is limited by reference to a definite date, whether the assessment is provisional or final:

Provided that—

(a) the said percentage and period shall not be specified more particularly than is necessary for the purpose of determining in accordance with section 12 of this Act the claimant’s rights as to disablement benefit; and

(b) a percentage between twenty and one hundred which is not a multiple of ten shall be treated—

(i) if it is a multiple of five, as being the next higher percentage which is a multiple of ten;

(ii) if it is not a multiple of five, as being the nearest percentage which is a multiple of ten.

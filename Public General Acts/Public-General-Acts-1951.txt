(b) in the case of an allowance payable to a person in any

other circumstances, shall not exceed forty shillings less the amount of his workmen’s compensation, and (except in respect of a period of total incapacity for

Ch. 22 Workmen's Compensation 14 & 15 Gbo. 6

(3) For the purpose of the references in the last foregoing subsection to a period of total incapacity for work resulting from the relevant injury or disease, a person who is or has been unable to obtain employment shall be treated as subject to such an incapacity if he is treated as being so for the purposes of his workmen’s compensation in respect of the relevant injury or disease and in such other circumstances as may be provided by a scheme.

(4) For the purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (2) hereof, the amount representing a person’s weekly loss of earnings due to the relevant injury or disease shall be ascertained—

(a) by comparing the standard of remuneration from time

to time obtaining in the class of employment in which he was employed at the time when the accident happened with the amount which in general he is earning or able to earn in some suitable employment or business; but

(b) if at that time he was less than twenty-one years of age,

with due regard to the reasonable prospects of advancement at that time of a person of similar age in his grade of employment :

(Provided that a scheme may make other provision for ascertaining the amount representing that loss where that class of employment has ceased to exist and in other special cases, and a scheme may also include provision for further defining the amount referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection and the principles on which it is to be ascertained.

(5) Any reference in this section to the amount of a person’s workmen’s compensation shall (subject to the following provisions of this section) be taken as referring to the amount (if any) of the weekly payments to which for the time being he is, or would but for the determination of his right be, entitled in respect of the relevant injury or disease:

(Supplementation) Act, 1951

Ch. 22

27

(7) A scheme may provide for modifying the operation of subsections (3) to (5) of this section in relation to a person whose workmen’s compensation is or was compensation under a contracting-out scheme in such manner as appears to the Minister to be proper having regard to the provisions of the contracting-out scheme.

(8) Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section shall be taken to prevent a scheme providing for the payment of more than one allowance to the same person in respect of different injuries or diseases, but the aggregate weekly rate of the allowances payable to a person in respect of the same period shall not exceed fifty-six shillings, where they are payable to a man in respect of a period of total incapacity for work resulting from any relevant injury or disease, being a period during which he is residing with or wholly or mainly maintaining his wife (or is under the provisions of a scheme to be treated as doing so), or forty shillings in any other case.

Provided that this subsection shall not apply where the transaction or, if there are more than one, all the transactions, was or were completed before the tenth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-one.

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by subsection (1) of this section, the powers conferred thereby extend—

{a) to the charging with the profits tax of persons who, but for the adjustments, would not be chargeable with any tax, or would not be chargeable to the same extent; and

(b) to the charging of a greater amount of tax than would be chargeable but for the adjustments.

(3) If it appears in the case of any transaction or transactions, being a transaction which involves, or transactions one or more of which involve—

(a) the transfer or acquisition of shares in or debentures of a

company; or

(b) a change or changes in the person or persons carrying

(4) Any direction of the Commissioners under this section shall specify the transaction or transactions giving rise to the direction and the adjustments as respects liability to the profits tax which the Commissioners consider appropriate.

(5) No direction shall be given by the Commissioners under this section by reason only—

(a) that, in the case of any body corporate, unincorporated society or other body, no distribution to proprietors has been made or only a smaller distribution than might have been made; or

1951

Finance A, 1951

(b) that debentures of a company (not being a company the directors whereof have a controlling interest therein) have been issued for full consideration paid in cash to the company,

or by reason of any transaction which, or of any transactions all of which, required and received the consent of the Treasury under section thirty-six of this Act, if the consent was specially given to the transaction or transactions in question, was given before the carrying out thereof, and was given after full and accurate disclosure by the applicants for the consent of all facts and considerations material to be known to the Treasury.

(6) If—

(a) a body corporate, unincorporated society or other body

furnishes to the Commissioners particulars of a transaction or transactions effected or to be effected by them; and

(b) the Commissioners are satisfied that the transaction or

transactions as described in the particulars have been, or, as the case may be, will be, entered into for bona fide commercial reasons and are such that no direction ought to be given under this section in respect of it or them,

they shall notify the body corporate, unincorporated society or other body accordingly, and thereupon their power to give a direction under this section with respect to the transaction or transactions in question shall cease:

Provided that—

(i) the particulars given under this subsection with respect

to any transaction or transactions shall be such as to make full and accurate disclosure of all facts and considerations relating thereto which are material to be known to the Commissioners and, where the requirements of this paragraph of this proviso are not complied with, any notification given by the Commissioners under this subsection shall be void; and

(8) In this section, “ debenture ” has the meaning assigned to it by section four hundred and fifty-five of the Companies Act, 1948, and “ company ” and “ director ” have the same meanings as for the purposes of the Fourth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1937.

Part IV Death Duties

33.—(1) Section thirty-one of the Finance Act, 1937, and section thirty-one of the Finance Act, 1949 (which sections exempt from estate duty in certain circumstances land given to the National Trust and maintenance funds given with land so exempted, and are hereafter in this section respectively called “ the 1937 section ” and “ the 1949 section ”), shall in the case of property given to the National Trust be extended as follows: —

(a) any exemption from estate duty conferred by the 1937

section in relation to an estate or interest in land given by any person to the Trust shall be granted also, and to the like extent, to any objects ordinarily kept at the time of the gift in a building forming part of the land, and given by him with that estate or interest with a view to their preservation or use in the building, and where objects so given are exempted by virtue of this paragraph the 1949 section shall apply as if they formed part of the building;

(b) where a person gives to the Trust any objects ordinarily

kept at the time of the gift in a building which is then inalienably vested in the Trust, and he does so with a view to the objects' preservation or use in the building, then (subject to paragraph () of this subsection) the 1937 section and the 1949 section shall apply in the case of the objects so given as if the property comprised in the gift had been an estate or interest in land, except that any condition as to the Trust’s interest being held by it inalienably for the public benefit shall not apply;

(c) where a person gives property to the Trust as a source

of income for the upkeep—

(i) of any land which is at the time of the gift inalienably vested in the Trust; or

1951

(ii) of any objects which are then vested in the Trust and ordinarily kept in a building forming part of any such land, having been given to the Trust with a view to their preservation or use in that building; and he gave or joined in giving to the Trust its estate or interest in that land or those objects, as the case may be, then (subject to paragraph () of this subsection) the 1937 section shall apply in the case of any of the property so given, whether an estate or interest in land or not, as it applies to an estate or interest in land, except that any condition as to the Trust’s interest being held by it inalienably for the public benefit shall not apply;

() paragraph (b) and sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (c) of this subsection shall not apply in the case of any objects unless the gift of the objects or property in respect of which exemption is claimed by virtue of that paragraph is made by a person who also gave or joined in giving to the Trust its estate or interest in the building in which the objects are ordinarily kept at the time of the said gift.

(2) Where, with a view to the preservation of a house or other building for the public benefit, a person gives or has given an estate or interest in the building to, or to trustees for, a Government department, a local authority or any other body not established or conducted for profit, and the Treasury (whether before or after the time of the gift) direct that the gift should be treated as falling within this subsection, then the 1937 section and the 1949 section, together with the foregoing subsection of this section, shall apply in relation to the building and any grounds given with it and specified in the direction, as if references to the National Trust were references to that department, authority or body or to those trustees as the case may be and as if their estate or interest in the building and any such grounds were inalienably vested in them.

In the two next following subsections any reference to a building includes any grounds specified or to be specified in a direction under this subsection relating to the building.

(3) The Treasury shall not give a direction under the foregoing subsection in the case of any building unless in their opinion—

(a) the building is one for the preservation of which special

steps should be taken by reason of its outstanding historic or architectural or aesthetic interest and the cost of preserving it; and

(b) the department authority or body in question is an appro-

priate one to be responsible for the building’s preservation;

and before giving any such direction the Treasury may require such undertakings to be entered into as they think appropriate

Letter No. 1

Letter from Mr. Arthur G. Bottomley, M.P., United Kingdom Secretary for Overseas Trade, to the Honourable Mr. Fazlur Rahman, Pakistan Minister of Commerce, on the question of Duty Free Entry of Goods Grown, Produced or Manufactured in Pakistan.

London, 2nd , 1951.

Dear Minister,

In connection with our discussions of the Trade Agreement which has been signed today, to replace the United Kingdom /India Agreement, 1939, I am writing to confirm the assurance which I gave you that the United Kingdom Government have no present intention of imposing duties on goods grown, produced or manufactured in Pakistan, which now are admitted free of duty, but should it become necessary to impose such duties, they will give the Pakistan Government prior notice of their intentions. You will understand that in accordance with Article III of the Agreement, any such duty would apply equally to similar goods from other Commonwealth countries, and that Pakistan goods would continue to be admitted on equal terms.

Yours sincerely,

A. G. BOTTOMLEY.

Letter from Mr. Arthur G. Bottomley, M.P., United Kingdom Secretary for Overseas Trade, to the Honourable Mr. Fazlur Rahman, Pakistan Minister of Commerce, on

THE SUBJECT OF TEA.

London, 2nd , 1951.

Dear Minister,

During the course of our discussions I have noted that tea is the principal commodity of export in which Pakistan is interested in getting preferential treatment in the United Kingdom and that if the export of tea to the United Kingdom fell appreciably below the present level, the advantages to Pakistan under the Agreement would be considerably reduced. I have, therefore, recognised that it is important that the present level of import of tea into the United Kingdom from Pakistan should be maintained, and the United Kingdom Government will use their good offices with commercial interests to this end. I should add that as tea is strictly rationed because of the shortage of supplies in die United Kingdom, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are anxious that as much tea as possible from Pakistan should be offered for sale.

Yours sincerely,

A. G. BOTTOMLEY.

(7) A sealed annuities register for any district shall be treated as conclusive evidence that no annuity other than those particulars whereof are comprised in the register was charged in respect of any land in the district at the date of the sealing of the register.

(8) A sealed annuities register or the map referred to therein may be varied by the Commission for correcting any clerical mistake therein, or any error therein arising from any accidental slip or omission, but not otherwise.

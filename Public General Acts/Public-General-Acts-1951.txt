(a) in the case of an allowance payable to a man in respect

of a period of total incapacity for work resulting from the relevant injury or disease, being a period during which he is residing with or wholly or mainly maintaining his wife (or is under the provisions of a scheme to be treated as doing so), shall not exceed fifty-six shillings less the amount of his workmen’s compensation; and

(b) in the case of an allowance payable to a person in any

other circumstances, shall not exceed forty shillings less the amount of his workmen’s compensation, and (except in respect of a period of total incapacity for

Ch. 22 Workmen's Compensation 14 & 15 Geo. 6

(i Supplementation) , 1951

work resulting from the relevant injury or disease) shall also not exceed the difference between two-thirds of the amount representing his weekly loss of earnings due to the relevant injury or disease and the amount of that compensation.

(3) For the purpose of the references in the last foregoing subsection to a period of total incapacity for work resulting from the relevant injury or disease, a person who is or has been unable to obtain employment shall be treated as subject to such an incapacity if he is treated as being so for the purposes of his workmen’s compensation in respect of the relevant injury or disease and in such other circumstances as may be provided by a scheme.

(4) For the purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (2) hereof, the amount representing a person’s weekly loss of earnings due to the relevant injury or disease shall be ascertained—

(a) by comparing the standard of remuneration from time

to time obtaining in the class of employment in which he was employed at the time when the accident happened with the amount which in general he is earning or able to earn in some suitable employment or business; but

(b) if at that time he was less than twenty-one years of age,

with due regard to the reasonable prospects of advancement at that time of a person of similar age in his grade of employment :

(Provided that a scheme may make other provision for ascertaining the amount representing that loss where that class of employment has ceased to exist and in other special cases, and a scheme may also include provision for further defining the amount referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection and the principles on which it is to be ascertained.

(5) Any reference in this section to the amount of a person’s workmen’s compensation shall (subject to the following provisions of this section) be taken as referring to the amount (if any) of the weekly payments to which for the time being he is, or would but for the determination of his right be, entitled in respect of the relevant injury or disease:

(Supplementation) Act, 1951

Ch. 22

27

and the amount is shown to have been reduced in consequence, the amount of those weekly payments shall for the purposes of this subsection be taken to be the reduced amount so fixed with the addition of the amount of the reduction; and

(b) where the amount of those weekly payments has not been fixed under the said provisions, it shall be fixed for the purposes of this subsection without regard to any such payment, allowance or benefit as aforesaid.

(6) Where a person is or has since the commencement of this Act been entitled to payments under the Workmen’s Compensation (War Addition) Acts, 1917 and 1919, but has before that commencement ceased to be entitled to any other weekly payments by way of workmen’s compensation in respect of the relevant injury or disease, the amount of his workmen’s compensation shall for the purposes of this section be calculated as if he had not ceased to be entitled to such other payments.

(7) A scheme may provide for modifying the operation of subsections (3) to (5) of this section in relation to a person whose workmen’s compensation is or was compensation under a contracting-out scheme in such manner as appears to the Minister to be proper having regard to the provisions of the contracting-out scheme.

(8) Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section shall be taken to prevent a scheme providing for the payment of more than one allowance to the same person in respect of different injuries or diseases, but the aggregate weekly rate of the allowances payable to a person in respect of the same period shall not exceed fifty-six shillings, where they are payable to a man in respect of a period of total incapacity for work resulting from any relevant injury or disease, being a period during which he is residing with or wholly or mainly maintaining his wife (or is under the provisions of a scheme to be treated as doing so), or forty shillings in any other case.

(4) Where by virtue of subsection (2) of this section there is deemed to be a distribution to the members of a body corporate, society or other body by reason of the capitalisation of any distributable sum—

avoidance or reduction of liability to the profits tax which would otherwise be effected by the transaction or transactions:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply where the transaction or, if there are more than one, all the transactions, was or were completed before the tenth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-one.

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by subsection (1) of this section, the powers conferred thereby extend—

(a) to the charging with the profits tax of persons who, but for the adjustments, would not be chargeable with any tax, or would not be chargeable to the same extent; and

(b) to the charging of a greater amount of tax than would be chargeable but for the adjustments.

(3) If it appears in the case of any transaction or transactions, being a transaction which involves, or transactions one or more of which involve—

(a) the transfer or acquisition of shares in or debentures of a

company; or

(b) a change or changes in the person or persons carrying

on a trade or business or part of a trade or business; or

(c) a change or changes in the directors of a company the

(4) Any direction of the Commissioners under this section shall specify the transaction or transactions giving rise to the direction and the adjustments as respects liability to the profits tax which the Commissioners consider appropriate.

(5) No direction shall be given by the Commissioners under this section by reason only—

(a) that, in the case of any body corporate, unincorporated society or other body, no distribution to proprietors has been made or only a smaller distribution than might have been made; or

1951

Finance A, 1951

Ch. 43

(b) that debentures of a company (not being a company the directors whereof have a controlling interest therein) have been issued for full consideration paid in cash to the company,

or by reason of any transaction which, or of any transactions all of which, required and received the consent of the Treasury under section thirty-six of this Act, if the consent was specially given to the transaction or transactions in question, was given before the carrying out thereof, and was given after full and accurate disclosure by the applicants for the consent of all facts and considerations material to be known to the Treasury.

(6) If—

(a) a body corporate, unincorporated society or other body

furnishes to the Commissioners particulars of a transaction or transactions effected or to be effected by them; and

(b) the Commissioners are satisfied that the transaction or

transactions as described in the particulars have been, or, as the case may be, will be, entered into for bona fide commercial reasons and are such that no direction ought to be given under this section in respect of it or them,

they shall notify the body corporate, unincorporated society or other body accordingly, and thereupon their power to give a direction under this section with respect to the transaction or transactions in question shall cease:

Provided that—

(i) the particulars given under this subsection with respect

to any transaction or transactions shall be such as to make full and accurate disclosure of all facts and considerations relating thereto which are material to be known to the Commissioners and, where the requirements of this paragraph of this proviso are not complied with, any notification given by the Commissioners under this subsection shall be void; and

(ii) in no event shall the giving of a notification under this subsection with respect to any transaction or transactions prevent the giving by file Commissioners of a direction under this section with respect to transactions which include that transaction or all or some of those transactions and also include another transaction or other transactions. 7

(a) any exemption from estate duty conferred by the 1937

section in relation to an estate or interest in land given by any person to the Trust shall be granted also, and to the like extent, to any objects ordinarily kept at the time of the gift in a building forming part of the land, and given by him with that estate or interest with a view to their preservation or use in the building, and where objects so given are exempted by virtue of this paragraph the 1949 section shall apply as if they formed part of the building;

(b) where a person gives to the Trust any objects ordinarily

kept at the time of the gift in a building which is then inalienably vested in the Trust, and he does so with a view to the objects' preservation or use in the building, then (subject to paragraph () of this subsection) the 1937 section and the 1949 section shall apply in the case of the objects so given as if the property comprised in the gift had been an estate or interest in land, except that any condition as to the Trust’s interest being held by it inalienably for the public benefit shall not apply;

(c) where a person gives property to the Trust as a source

of income for the upkeep—

(i) of any land which is at the time of the gift inalienably vested in the Trust; or

1951

Finance Act, 1951

(ii) of any objects which are then vested in the Trust and ordinarily kept in a building forming part of any such land, having been given to the Trust with a view to their preservation or use in that building; and he gave or joined in giving to the Trust its estate or interest in that land or those objects, as the case may be, then (subject to paragraph () of this subsection) the 1937 section shall apply in the case of any of the property so given, whether an estate or interest in land or not, as it applies to an estate or interest in land, except that any condition as to the Trust’s interest being held by it inalienably for the public benefit shall not apply;

() paragraph (b) and sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (c) of this subsection shall not apply in the case of any objects unless the gift of the objects or property in respect of which exemption is claimed by virtue of that paragraph is made by a person who also gave or joined in giving to the Trust its estate or interest in the building in which the objects are ordinarily kept at the time of the said gift.

(2) Where, with a view to the preservation of a house or other building for the public benefit, a person gives or has given an estate or interest in the building to, or to trustees for, a Government department, a local authority or any other body not established or conducted for profit, and the Treasury (whether before or after the time of the gift) direct that the gift should be treated as falling within this subsection, then the 1937 section and the 1949 section, together with the foregoing subsection of this section, shall apply in relation to the building and any grounds given with it and specified in the direction, as if references to the National Trust were references to that department, authority or body or to those trustees as the case may be and as if their estate or interest in the building and any such grounds were inalienably vested in them.

In the two next following subsections any reference to a building includes any grounds specified or to be specified in a direction under this subsection relating to the building.

(3) The Treasury shall not give a direction under the foregoing subsection in the case of any building unless in their opinion—

(a) the building is one for the preservation of which special

steps should be taken by reason of its outstanding historic or architectural or aesthetic interest and the cost of preserving it; and

(b) the department authority or body in question is an appro-

priate one to be responsible for the building’s preservation;

and before giving any such direction the Treasury may require such undertakings to be entered into as they think appropriate

for securing the preservation of the building and reasonable access thereto for the public (including undertakings restricting the use or disposal of the building).

(4) Any undertakings entered into as aforesaid may be varied from time to time by agreement between the Treasury and the person bound by the undertakings, and the Treasury may require further undertakings to be entered into as a condition for agreeing to any such variation or consenting to anything for which their consent is required by any undertaking; and the obligations imposed by any such undertaking shall be enforceable for the public benefit by injunction (or, in Scotland, by interdict or by petition under section ninety-one of the Court of Session Act, 1868), and any purported disposition of a building in contravention thereof be void, as if the obligations had been imposed by Act of Parliament.

(5) For the purposes of this section, except in so far as the context otherwise requires,—

the expression " give " shall be construed accordingly, and in relation to a devise or bequest any reference to the time of the gift shall be construed as a reference to the time of the testator’s death;

(b) the expression " vested " means indefeasibly vested, and

a building or land shall be deemed to be inalienably vested in the National Trust if an estate or interest therein is vested in the Trust (whether in possession or not) and has been so dealt with as to be held by the Trust inalienably;

(c) any reference to giving objects shall be construed as a

reference to giving the whole or a limited interest in the objects, and any reference to objects being vested in the National Trust shall be construed accordingly;

() the expression "National Trust" means the National

Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty or, in relation to Scotland, the National Trust for Scotland for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty;

(6) An object shall not be deemed for the purposes of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section to be given with an estate or interest in land if either is subject to an interest or power of appointment created by the gift of it to which the other is not subject:

Provided that, where the object is given subject to one or more life interests created by the gift of it to which the estate or

1951

Finance A, 1951

Letter No. 1

Letter from Mr. Arthur G. Bottomley, M.P., United Kingdom Secretary for Overseas Trade, to the Honourable Mr. Fazlur Rahman, Pakistan Minister of Commerce, on the question of Duty Free Entry of Goods Grown, Produced or Manufactured in Pakistan.

London, 2nd , 1951.

Dear Minister,

In connection with our discussions of the Trade Agreement which has been signed today, to replace the United Kingdom /India Agreement, 1939, I am writing to confirm the assurance which I gave you that the United Kingdom Government have no present intention of imposing duties on goods grown, produced or manufactured in Pakistan, which now are admitted free of duty, but should it become necessary to impose such duties, they will give the Pakistan Government prior notice of their intentions. You will understand that in accordance with Article III of the Agreement, any such duty would apply equally to similar goods from other Commonwealth countries, and that Pakistan goods would continue to be admitted on equal terms.

Yours sincerely,

A. G. BOTTOMLEY.

Letter from Mr. Arthur G. Bottomley, M.P., United Kingdom Secretary for Overseas Trade, to the Honourable Mr. Fazlur Rahman, Pakistan Minister of Commerce, on

THE SUBJECT OF TEA.

London, 2nd , 1951.

Dear Minister,

During the course of our discussions I have noted that tea is the principal commodity of export in which Pakistan is interested in getting preferential treatment in the United Kingdom and that if the export of tea to the United Kingdom fell appreciably below the present level, the advantages to Pakistan under the Agreement would be considerably reduced. I have, therefore, recognised that it is important that the present level of import of tea into the United Kingdom from Pakistan should be maintained, and the United Kingdom Government will use their good offices with commercial interests to this end. I should add that as tea is strictly rationed because of the shortage of supplies in the United Kingdom, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are anxious that as much tea as possible from Pakistan should be offered for sale.

Yours sincerely,

A. G. BOTTOMLEY.

(6) subsection (2) of section thirty-eight (which relates to companies having subsidiaries),

a difference in respect of which a non-distribution relief was given to or in respect of any body corporate is to be treated (in whole or in part) as if it had been a difference arising in relation to another body corporate on which non-distribution relief had been given to that body, then, for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, relief shall be treated as having been given to the second mentioned body on the difference or the relevant part thereof at the rate or rates at which it was given on the difference to or in respect of the first mentioned body.

2.—(1) If. in the case of any accounting period of a body corporate, unincorporated society or other body beginning before the end of the year nineteen hundred and fifty, the total of the dividends assignable to that period exceeds the governing total, any such dividends declared after the ninth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-one, shall, to the extent of the excess—

(2) The normal price of any removed or imported goods shall be determined on the following assumptions:—

(a) that the goods are treated as having been delivered to the buyer at the port or place of importation into the United Kingdom (in the case of removed goods) or at the port or place of importation into the Isle of Man (in the case of imported goods); and

(b) that the seller will bear freight, insurance, commission and all other costs, charges and expenses incidental to the sale and the delivery of the goods at that port or place; but

(c) that the buyer will bear any duty or tax chargeable in the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man.

2. A sale in the open market between buyer and seller independent of each other pre-supposes—

(a) that the price is the sole consideration; and

(b) that the price made is not influenced by any commercial, financial or other relationship, whether by contract or otherwise, between the seller or any person associated in business with him and the buyer or any person associated in business with him (other than the relationship created by the sale of the goods in question); and

(c) that no part of the proceeds of the subsequent re-sale, use or

disposal of the goods will accrue either directly or indirectly to the seller or any person associated in business with him.

3. —(1) Where the goods to be valued—

(a) are manufactured in accordance with any patented invention or are goods to which any registered design has been applied; or

(b) are imported under a foreign trade mark, or are imported for sale (whether or not after further manufacture) under a foreign trade mark;

(6) If the Minister is satisfied that any work carried out by or on behalf of an operator is work in respect of which the operator would be entitled (subject to the determination of the rate or to the making of a claim under this section) to receive a payment under section nine of this Act, he may advance to the operator such sum on account of that payment as he thinks proper, notwithstanding that the rate has not been determined or that a claim has not been made under this section.

(7) A sealed annuities register for any district shall be treated as conclusive evidence that no annuity other than those particulars whereof are comprised in the register was charged in respect of any land in the district at the date of the sealing of the register.

(8) A sealed annuities register or the map referred to therein may be varied by the Commission for correcting any clerical mistake therein, or any error therein arising from any accidental slip or omission, but not otherwise.

(9) An annuities register and the map referred to therein shall when sealed be deposited at the principal office of the Commission.

(b) the expression " new discharge " means a discharge which is not, as respects the nature and composition, temperature, volume and rate of discharge of the effluent, substantially a continuation of a previous discharge made within the preceding twelve months (whether by the same or a different outlet), so however that a discharge which is in other respects a continuation of a previous discharge made as aforesaid shall not be deemed to be a new discharge by reason of any reduction of the temperature or volume or rate of discharge of the effluent as compared with the previous discharge.

(9) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to the bringing into use of any new or altered outlet which forms part of the sewage disposal or sewerage works of a local authority if its construction or alteration, as the case may be, or the raising of a loan to defray the cost thereof, has been approved or authorised by the Minister or, before the thirtieth day of January, nineteen hundred and fifty-one, by the Minister of Health.

(10) Any question whether the consent of a river board has or has not been unreasonably withheld or as to the reasonableness of any conditions or of any variation of any conditions shall be determined for the purposes of this section by the Minister.

(11) If, on an application to the Minister for him to determine a question under the last foregoing subsection, he determines that the withholding of consent, or the condition imposed, or the variation of a condition, as the case may be, was unreasonable, then—

(a) where the application was in respect of the withholding

of consent, he may direct that the consent shall be treated as given either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as appear to him to be reasonable;

(b) where the application was in respect of the unreason-

ableness of any condition imposed, he may direct either that the condition shall be treated as annulled or that there shall be substituted for it such condition as appears to him to be reasonable;

(c) where the application was in respect of the reasonable-

ness of any variation of a condition, he may direct either

1951 Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Ch. 64

Act, 1951

that the condition shall be treated as continuing in force unvaried or that it shall be varied in such manner as appears to him to be reasonable;

but, as respects the period before the giving of the direction, this section shall apply as if the withholding of consent, or the condition imposed, or the variation of a condition, as the case may be, had not been unreasonable.

(12) If a river board fail, within three months of the making to them of an application for their consent under this section, to give the person proposing to bring into use the new or altered outlet or to begin to make the new discharge, as the case may be, notice that they give or refuse their consent, the consent shall be deemed to be given unconditionally at the expiration of those three months.

(13) Where a person, in contravention of this section, brings into use a new or altered outlet or begins to make a new discharge without obtaining the consent of the river board or without observing any conditions imposed by the river board in giving their consent under this section (being conditions to be satisfied before the outlet is brought into use or the new discharge begins to be made), he shall be liable—

(a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds; or

(b) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds.

(14) No person shall cause or knowingly permit to enter a stream by an outlet, or from land or premises, in relation to which conditions have been imposed under this section and are for the time being in force, a trade or sewage effluent not complying with those conditions, and any person who does so shall be guilty of an offence punishable under section two of this Act.

(15) Section three of this Act shall apply in relation to the last foregoing subsection as it applies in relation to subsection (1) of section two of this Act.

(a) he has given the river board notice of his intention to do so not less than three months beforehand (or such less period as the board may agree to); and

526 Ch. 64 Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) 14 & 15GB0.6

Act, 1951

(b) in the case of a new or altered outlet, the outlet is so constructed as to comply with any conditions reasonably imposed by the board to enable them to exercise their right to take samples of the effluent;

and any person contravening this subsection shall be liable, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds or, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply to the bringing into use of any new or altered outlet which forms part of the sewage disposal or sewerage works of a local authority if in construction or alteration, as the case may be, or the raising of a loan to defray the cost thereof, has been approved or authorised by the Minister or, before the thirtieth day of January, nineteen hundred and fifty-one, by the Minister of Health.

(17) Section six of this Act shall apply in relation to the foregoing provisions of this section, except the last foregoing subsection, as it applies in relation to sections two to five of this Act, and the last foregoing subsection shall not apply in relation to any tidal waters or parts of the sea to which any of the preceding provisions of this section are applied by virtue of this subsection.

this Act applies, if it was reinstated before the ending of the additional period referred to in subsection (2) of section fifty-four of this Act, the date of the ending of that period, or, if it is reinstated after the ending of that period, the date on which the decision for reinstatement is notified.

(3) Where at the time for writing-off there are relevant arrears on a policy as to which relief from forfeiture has been granted, or which has been reinstated, under either of the two last preceding sections, and the policy is then in force and a claim has not arisen thereunder, the terms of the policy shall be varied in accordance with the following provisions of this subsection.

If the policy is a policy for the whole term of fife, the relevant arrears shall be extinguished by a reduction of the sum assured under the policy, the amount of the reduction being the amount of those arrears multiplied by the factor shown in

(4) Where a claim arises under such a policy (or, in the case of a policy reinstated, is to be deemed by virtue of subsection (3) of the next succeeding section to have arisen thereunder) before the time for writing-off and there are or were relevant arrears thereon at the time when the claim arises or is to be deemed to have arisen, the amount payable in respect of the claim shall be reduced by the amount of those arrears together with compound interest thereon at the rate of three per cent, per annum with half-yearly rests.

For the purposes of this subsection any sums paid or tendered in respect of any premiums shall be treated as satisfying them in the order in which they fell due.

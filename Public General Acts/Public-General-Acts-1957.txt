(2) Every fees order made after the passing of this Act shall indicate, with respect to every fee fixed by the order, whether it is to be payable out of capital or out of income.

(3) Where a fees order made after the passing of this Act provides that a fee is to be payable out of capital, and it appears to the public trustee, in the case of a particular trust fund in respect of which the fee is payable, that there are special reasons which render it expedient that the fee should be paid out of income, the public trustee may direct that the fee shall in that case be payable out of income:

Provided that, if a person of full age is for the time being beneficially entitled in possession to the income of the trust fund (being so entitled directly under the trust in relation to which the fee is payable, and not by virtue of a derivative settlement), the public trustee shall not give a direction under this subsection in respect of that trust fund except with the consent in writing of that person.

(4) The power conferred by the last preceding subsection shall apply to any trust, whether accepted by the public trustee after or before the passing of this Act.

(5) As from the date on which the first fees order made after the passing of this Act comes into operation (in this Act referred to as“ the commencement date ”), subsection (5) of section nine of the principal Act (which relates to the incidence of the fees and expenses of the public trustee as between capital and income) shall cense to apply to fees; and accordingly in that subsection,

(2) The deduction shall be equal to one-fifth of the net annual value, except that where the gross value of the hereditament has been reduced by virtue of section four of the Valuation for Rating Act, 1953 (which relates to hereditaments used partly for the purposes of private dwellings) the deduction shall be equal to one-seventh of the net annual value.

4, —(1) References in Part I of the Local Government Act, 1948, to the rateable value for an area for a year shall be construed as if in subsection (2) of section one hundred and forty-four (which relates to the construction of such references) there were inserted, at the end of the words preceding the proviso, the words “ reduced, in either case, as mentioned in subsection (2A) of this section”, and after the said subsection (2) there were inserted the following subsection:—

“ (2A) For the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, the total or aggregate referred to therein shall be reduced to what it Would have been if the rateable value of any hereditament to which section eight of the Rating and Valuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1955, applies for the whole or any part of the year had been an amount bearing to that rateable value the same proportion as the amount of rates chargeable for the year in respect of that hereditament bears to the amount of rates which would have been so chargeable if the said section eight had not applied to it; and the two last-mentioned amounts shall be ascertained by reference to the rating authority’s audited accounts for the year.”

(2) This section shall have effect as respects the year 1957-58 and subsequent years.

and Subsidies) Act, 1957

them by this Act to impose and vary duties of customs in such manner as they think necessary to meet the dumping or the giving of the subsidy:

Provided that, where the Board of Trade are not satisfied that the effect of the dumping or of the giving of the subsidy is such as to cause or threaten material injury to an established industry in the United Kingdom or is such as to retard materially the establishment of an industry in the United Kingdom, the Board shall not exercise that power if it appears to them that to do so woijld conflict with the obligations of Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom under the provisions for the time being in force of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concluded at Geneva in the year nineteen hundred and forty-seven.

(2) For the purposes of this Act imported goods shall be regarded as having been dumped—

(2) The said date is such date as may be specified in a notice served on the tenant by the landlord at or after the time of decontrol, being a date not earlier than fifteen months after the time of decontrol nor than six months after the service of the notice, but nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the execution of an order for possession obtained by the landlord before the time of decontrol.

(3) Where for the purposes of section eleven of this Act the rateable value of the dwelling-house falls to be ascertained by apportionment, no notice shall be served under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph until the apportionment has been made in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

(4) Where sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph applies and at any time between the time of decontrol and the time when the tenant ceases to be entitled to retain possession by virtue of this Schedule there is cuh-ent, in relation to the tenant, a period of residence protection (within the meaning of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces (Protection of Civil Interests) Act, 1951), the date which may be specified in a notice under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph shall not be earlier than the expiration of fifteen months after the end of the period of residence protection, and any such notice served before die beginning of that period which specifies an earlier date, being a notice which would have had effect apart from this sub-paragraph, shall have effect as if the date specified therein were the date on which the said fifteen months expires.

4. If before the date specified under sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 2 of this Schedule the landlord and tenant agree for the creation of a tenancy of the premises of which the tenant is entitled to retain possession by virtue of that paragraph, being a tenancy not expiring, or terminable by notice to quit given by the landlord, earlier than three years from the commencement thereof, the two last foregoing paragraphs shall cease to apply as from the commencement of that tenancy.

(a) neither the repeals effected by this Act nor anything in section eleven thereof shall affect the recovery of that part of the rent in respect of any rental period after the time of decontrol, but {b) if such a part of the rent consists of or includes an increase agreed or determined under section forty of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, in respect of services which the landlord is not under the terms of the tenancy liable to provide, then if those services are withheld in whole or in part during any rental period after the time of decontrol the rent recoverable for that period shall be decreased by an appropriate amount, and subsection (2) of section four of this Act shall apply for the purposes of determining any question whether, or by what amount, the recoverable rent is decreased by virtue of this paragraph.

8. Where at the time of decontrol any rent has been underpaid or any sum has been paid by way of rent which by virtue of the

1957

Rent Act, 1957

Ch. 25

169

Rent Acts or this Act is irrecoverable from the tenant, nothing in this Act shall be taken to affect the right of any person to recover that sum from any other person from whom he could have recovered it if the Rent Acts had continued to apply to the dwelling-house; and where any sum could under the Rent Acts have been recovered from the landlord by a deduction from rent it shall continue to be so recoverable notwithstanding that the Rent Acts have ceased to apply to the dwelling-house.

9. —(1) Where a tenancy which immediately before the time of decontrol was a controlled tenancy not falling within sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 2 of this Schedule contains a provision (however expressed) whereby the landlord is entitled, on or after the Rent Acts ceasing to apply to the dwelling-house, to increase the rent otherwise than in respect of rates, the provision of services or the use of furniture, and the amount by which the rent may be so increased is not specified by the terms of the tenancy, the tenant may by notice in writing served on the landlord not later than three months after the time of decontrol elect that as from the service of the notice the foregoing provisions of this Schedule shall apply as if the tenancy had been such a tenancy as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 2 of this Schedule.

(2) Where a notice is served under this paragraph the tenancy to which it relates, and any sub-tenancy thereof (whether or not an immediate sub-tenancy), shall come to an end on the service of the notice; and if any such sub-tenancy was one falling within die foregoing sub-paragraph, then as from the service of the notice the foregoing provisions of this Schedule shall apply as if the sub-tenancy had been such a tenancy as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 2 of this Schedule.

This sub-paragraph shall not prejudice the power of a sub-tenant to serve a notice under this paragraph where no such notice has been served by a superior tenant.

(3) In the case of a tenancy falling within sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, the rent shall not in any case be increased under the terms of the tenancy as respects a rental period beginning before the expiration of three months after the time of decontrol.

10. For the purposes of this Schedule the power of a tenant under a tenancy for a term of years to terminate the tenancy at a specified point during the term shall not be treated as a power to terminate the tenancy by notice to quit.

11. A statutory tenancy which, immediately before the time of decontrol, was one to which, but for paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section forty-three of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954, Part II of that Act would have applied if it had been a tenancy within the meaning of that Act, shall after the time of decontrol be deemed for the purposes of that Act to be a tenancy to which Part II thereof applies, being a tenancy continuing by virtue of section twenty-four of that Act after the expiry of a term of years certain, and accordingly paragraph 2 of this Schedule shall not apply to it.

12. Where any mortgaged property consists of or comprises one or more dwelling-houses to which the Rent Acts applied immediately

without the consent of the wife, unless that consent is unreasonably withheld.

(2) Any such regulations may make such modifications of the principal Act or this Act in the application thereof in a case where a person elects as aforesaid as may appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient, and may in particular provide for determining how contributions paid by that person, whether before or after that person’s first retirement or, as the case may be, first becoming entitled to a retirement pension, are to be dealt with for the purposes of subsection (4) of section twenty of the principal Act.

2.—(1) In relation to a woman who attains pensionable age on or after the date of commencement of this subsection and who, immediately before attaining that age, is entitled to widow’s benefit—

(a) paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section twenty-one of

the principal Act (which provides for a woman to be entitled to a retirement pension by virtue of the insurance of a husband in respect of whose death she was immediately before attaining pensionable age entitled to widow’s benefit) shall not apply;

(b) subsection (6) of the said section twenty-one (which provides that where a woman, immediately before attaining pensionable age, is a widow not entitled to widow’s benefit, account may be taken of her husband’s contributions for the purpose of her right to a retirement pension by virtue of her own insurance) shall have effect as if the words “ not entitled to widow’s benefit ” were omitted;

(c) the following provisions of the principal Act, that is to

say, paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of section seventeen (which limits the payment of a widow’s pension to periods during which the widow is under pensionable age) and paragraph (a) of subsection (1) and paragraph

(a) of subsection (4) of section eighteen (which paragraphs confer certain rights with respect to a widow’s pension on a widow who is under pensionable age) shall have effect as if after the words “ pensionable age ” in each of those paragraphs there were inserted the words “or, being over pensionable age, has not retired from regular employment ”; and

id) regulations made by virtue of subsection (3) of section seventy-one of the principal Act (which relates to certain women over the age of fifty immediately before the appointed day for the purposes of that Act) shall not apply.

(3) For subsections (1) to (3) of section twenty-six of the principal Act (which makes provision as to unemployment and sickness benefit for persons over pensionable age) there shall be substituted the following two subsections: —

’* (1) Subject to the next following subsection, a person who is over pensionable age but has not retired from regular employment shall be entitled to unemployment or sickness benefit in respect of any day for which he would be so entitled if for the conditions specified in paragraphs (a) and

(b) of subsection (1) of section eleven of this Act there were substituted a condition that on the day for which benefit is claimed he would be entitled to a retirement pension had he retired from regular employment on attaining pensionable age and made the necessary claim.

(2) Where unemployment or sickness benefit is payable by virtue of this section—

(a) the weekly rate thereof, apart from any increase by

virtue of any provision of this Act, shall be that at which, apart from any such increase, the said retirement pension would have been payable;

(b) paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2) of section twenty-four of this Act shall not apply in relation to the unemployment or sickness benefit; and

(c) if the beneficiary would have been entitled to the retire-

ment pension only by virtue of section twenty-five of this Act, that section shall have effect in relation to an increase of the weekly rate of unemployment or sickness benefit as if he were entitled to that benefit only by virtue of that section and as if the relevant contribution conditions for that benefit were those for the retirement pension ”; and consequently in subsection (4) of the said section twenty-six the words “ (including the rate of any increase thereof) ” shall cease to have effect:

Provided that where a person was in receipt of unemployment or sickness benefit by virtue of the said section twenty-six immediately before the commencement of this subsection, then, for so long as that person would have continued without a break to receive one or other of those benefits if this subsection had not been passed, he shall continue to receive that benefit at a weekly rate, including any increase by virtue of any provision of the principal Act, not less than that at which the benefit would have been payable if this subsection had not been passed.

(4) For paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section twenty of the principal Act (which relates to the circumstances in which a

1957

Ch. 26

195

person may be treated as having retired from regular employment) there shall be substituted the following—

“ (b) subject to the next following paragraph, a person shall not be treated as having retired from regular employment unless he has complied with the prescribed requirements as to notice of the date of his retirement and—

(i) where the date of retirement specified in the notice falls before the date when the notice is given, that person shall not be treated as having so retired earlier than on the date of commencement of the prescribed period before the giving of the notice;

(ii) where the date of retirement specified in the notice falls after the date when the notice is given, an award of a retirement pension as from the date of retirement so specified may be made before that date but shall be conditional on that person’s having retired on or before that date.”

3.—(1) In subsection (1) of section twenty-four of the principal Act, as amended by section six of the National Insurance Act, 1951 (which provides for the weekly rate of certain benefits to be increased by a specified amount for any period during which the beneficiary is residing with or is wholly or mainly maintaining his wife and her weekly earnings do not exceed twenty or, in certain circumstances, forty shillings)—

(a) for the words “ wholly or mainly maintaining ” there

shall be substituted the words “ contributing at a weekly rate of not less than that amount to the maintenance of”; and

(b) for the words from “ exceed ” onwards there shall be

[6th June, 1957]

BE it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

Liability in tort

1.—(1) The rules enacted by the two next following sections shall have effect, in place of the rules of the common law, to regulate the duty which an occupier of premises owes to his visitors in respect of dangers due to the state of the premises or to things done or omitted to be done on them.

(2) The rules so enacted shall regulate the nature of the duty imposed by law in consequence of a person’s occupation or control of premises and of any invitation or permission he gives (or is to be treated as giving) to another to enter or use the premises, but they shall not alter the rules of the common law as to the persons on whom a duty is so imposed or to whom it is owed; and accordingly for the purpose of the rules so enacted the persons who are to be treated as an occupier

1957

Occupiers' Liability , 1957

Ch. 31

303

and as his visitors are the same (subject to subsection (4) of this section) as the persons who would at common law be treated as an occupier and as his invitees or licensees.

(3) The rules so enacted in relation to an occupier of premises and his visitors shall also apply, in like manner and to the like extent as the principles applicable at common law to an occupier of premises and his invitees or licensees would apply, to regulate—

(a) the obligations of a person occupying or having control over any fixed or moveable structure, including any vessel, vehicle or aircraft; and

(b) the obligations of a person occupying or having control

over any premises or structure in respect of damage to property, including the property of persons who are not themselves his visitors.

(4) A person entering any premises in exercise of rights conferred by virtue of an access agreement or order under the National 12,13 & 14 Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949, is not, for the Geo. 6. c. 97. purposes of this Act, a visitor of the occupier of those premises.

2.—(1) An occupier of premises owes the same duty, the Extent of “ common duty of care ”, to all his visitors, except in so far as he occupier's is free to and does extend, restrict, modify or exclude his duty ordinary duty to any visitor or visitors by agreement or otherwise.

(2) The common duty of care is a duty to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there.

(3) The circumstances relevant for the present purpose include the degree of care, and of want of care, which would ordinarily be looked for in such a visitor, so that (for example) in proper cases—

(a) an occupier must be prepared for children to be less careful than adults; and

(b) an occupier may expect that a person, in the exercise of his calling, will appreciate and guard against any special risks ordinarily incident to it, so far as the occupier leaves him free to do so.

(4) In determining whether the occupier of premises has discharged the common duty of care to a visitor, regard is to be had to all the circumstances, so that (for example)—

(a) where damage is caused to a visitor by a danger of which he had been warned by the occupier, the warning is not to be treated without more as absolving the occupier from liability, unless in all the circumstances it was enough to enable the visitor to be reasonably safe; and

Occupiers' Liability Act, 1957 5 & 6 Euz. 2

304 Ch. 31 Occupiers' Liability Act9 1957 5 & 6 Euz. 2

Effect of contract on occupier's liability to third party. (6) where damage is caused to a visitor by a danger due to the faulty execution of any work of construction, maintenance or repair by an independent contractor employed by the occupier, the occupier is not to be treated without more as answerable for the danger if in all the circumstances he had acted reasonably in entrusting the work to an independent contractor and had taken such steps (if any) as he reasonably ought in order to satisfy himself that the contractor was competent and that the work had been properly done. (5) The common duty of care does not impose on an occupier any obligation to a visitor in respect of risks willingly accepted as his by the visitor (the question whether a risk was so accepted to be decided on the same principles as in other cases in which one person owes a duty of care to another). (6) For the purposes of this section, persons who enter premises for any purpose in the exercise of a right conferred by law are to be treated as permitted by the occupier to be there for that purpose, whether they in fact have his permission or not. 3.—(1) Where an occupier of premises is bound by contract to permit persons who are strangers to the contract to enter or use the premises, the duty of care which he owes to them as his visitors cannot be restricted or excluded by that contract, but (subject to any provision of the contract to the contrary) shall include the duty to perform his obligations under the contract, whether undertaken for their protection or not, in so far as those obligations go beyond the obligations otherwise involved in that duty. (2) A contract shall not by virtue of this section have the effect, unless it expressly so provides, of making an occupier who has taken all reasonable care answerable to strangers to the contract for dangers due to the faulty execution of any work of construction, maintenance or repair or other like operation by persons other than himself, his servants and persons acting under his direction and control. (3) In this section “ stranger to the contract ” means a person not for the time being entitled to the benefit of the contract as a party to it or as the successor by assignment or otherwise of a party to it, and accordingly includes a party to the contract who has ceased to be so entitled. (4) Where by the terms or conditions governing any tenancy (including a statutory tenancy which does not in law amount to a tenancy) either the landlord or the tenant is bound, though not by contract, to permit persons to enter or use premises of which he is the occupier, this section shall apply as if the tenancy were a contract between the landlord and the tenant

1957

Occupiers’ Liability Act, 1957

Ch. 31

305

(5) This section, in so far as it prevents the common duty of care from being restricted or excluded, applies to contracts entered into and tenancies created before the commencement of this Act, as well as to those entered into or created after its commencement; but, in so far as it enlarges the duty owed by an occupier beyond the common duty of care, it shall have effect . only in relation to obligations which are undertaken after that commencement or which are renewed by agreement (whether express or implied) after that commencement.

4.—(1) Where premises are occupied by any person under a Landlord’s tenancy which puts on the landlord an obligation to that person for the maintenance or repair of the premises, the landlord shall 0bjJ^j0n to owe to all persons who or whose goods may from time to time repair, be lawfully on the premises the same duty, in respect of dangers arising from any default by him in carrying out that obligation, as if he were an occupier of the premises and those persons or their goods were there by his invitation or permission (but without any contract).

38.—(1) Where property comprised in a gift inter vivos (being neither property setded by the gift, nor a sum of money in sterling or any other currency) is deemed for purposes of estate duty to pass on the death of the donor, and at some time before the death the donee has ceased to have the possession and enjoyment of any of the property so comprised, then subject to the provisions of this section the enactments relating to estate

1957

Finance A, 1957

Ch.49

493

duty in respect of gifts inter vivos (including this section) shall apply as if the property, if any, received by the donee in substitution for that property had been comprised in the gift instead of that property (but in addition to any other property so comprised).

(2) In the foregoing subsection, the reference to property received by the donee in substitution for property comprised in the gift includes in particular—

(a) in relation to property sold, exchanged or otherwise

disposed of by the donee, any benefit received by the donee by way of consideration for the sale, exchange or other disposition; and

(b) in relation to a debt or security, any benefit received by the donee in or towards the satisfaction or redemption thereof; and

(c) in relation to any right to acquire property, any property

acquired in pursuance of that right.

(3) Where at a time before the death of the donor the donee makes a gift of property comprised in the gift to him, or otherwise voluntarily divests himself of any such property otherwise than for a consideration in money or money's worth not less than the principal value of the property at that time, then unless he does so in favour of the donor he shall be treated for the purpose of subsection (1) of this section as continuing to have the possession and enjoyment of that property, and the principal value aforesaid shall be taken as the principal value of that property as property comprised in the gift; but for this purpose a disposition made by the donee by agreement shall not be deemed to be made voluntarily, if it is made to any authority who, when the agreement is made, are authorised by, or are or can be authorised under, any enactment to acquire the property compulsorily.

— cont. section) as having been comprised in the gift in addition to any

other property so comprised.

In this subsection the reference to an issue being made or right being granted to the donee as the holder of shares or debentures shall be taken to include any case in which an issue or grant is made to him as having been the holder of those shares or debentures, or is made to him in pursuance of an offer or invitation made to him as being or having been the holder of those shares or debentures, or of an offer or invitation in connection with which any preference is given to him as being or having been the holder thereof.

(5) Where either paragraph (c) of subsection (2) or subsection (4) of this section applies to determine, for purposes of estate duty on a death, the property comprised in a gift inter vivos made by the deceased, the value of any consideration in money or money’s worth given by the donee for the acquisition in pursuance of the right referred to in the said paragraph (c), or for the issue or grant referred to in the said subsection (4), as the case may be, shall be allowed as a deduction in valuing the property comprised in the gift as property deemed to pass on the death by virtue of the gift; but if any part (not being a sum of money) of the said consideration consists of property comprised in the same or another gift from the donor and deemed for purposes of estate duty to pass on his death, no deduction shall be made in respect of it under this subsection.

(6) For the purposes of the last foregoing subsection there shall be left out of account so much (if any) of the consideration for any shares in or debentures of a body corporate, or for the grant of any right to be issued with any such shares or debentures, as consists in the capitalisation of reserves of that body corporate, or in the retention by that body corporate, by way of set-off or otherwise, of any property distributable by it, or is otherwise provided directly or indirectly out of the assets or at the expense of that or any associated body corporate; and for this purpose two bodies corporate shall be deemed to be associated if one has a controlling interest in the other, or if some person has a controlling interest in both.

(7) In the case of a donee who dies before the donor, the foregoing subsections shall apply as if he had not died, and as if the acts of his personal representatives were his acts, and property taken by any person under his testamentary dispositions or on his intestacy (or partial intestacy) were taken under a gift made by him at the time of his death.

(8) Where property comprised in a gift inter vivos is deemed for purposes of estate duty to pass on the death of the donor, and that property was settled by the gift, the foregoing

1957

Finance A, 1957

Ch.49

495

provisions of this section shall not apply but, subject to the following provisions thereof, the enactments relating to estate duty in respect of gifts inter vivos shall apply as if the property comprised in the gift had consisted of the property comprised in the settlement at the time of the donor’s death, except in so far as that property neither is, nor represents, nor is derived from, property originally comprised in the gift:

Provided that if the settlement comes to an end at some time before the death of the donor as respects all or any of the property which on the death of the donor immediately before that time would be treated as comprised in the gift, the property in question, other than property to which the donor then becomes absolutely and beneficially entitled in possession, and any consideration (not consisting of rights under the settlement) given by the donor for any of the property to which he so becomes entitled shall be treated as comprised in the gift (in addition to any other property so comprised) and as being of a principal value, as property so comprised, equal to its principal value at that time.

(9) Where property comprised in a gift inter vivos is not settled by that gift, but is before the death of the donor settled by the donee, the foregoing subsections shall apply in relation to property comprised in the settlement as if the settlement had been made by the gift; and for this purpose property which becomes settled property under any testamentary disposition of the donee or on his intestacy (or partial intestacy) shall be treated as settled by him.

(10) For purposes of aggregation, any property which is by virtue of any of the foregoing provisions of this section to be treated as comprised in a gift inter vivos made by the deceased shall be deemed to be property in which the deceased had an interest, except in so far as it directly or indirectly represents or is derived from property originally comprised in the gift in which the deceased never had an interest.

(11) Where estate duty is chargeable on any property as property comprised in gifts inter vivos made by the deceased, but in the case of any donee the gifts to him or some of them would be exempted by virtue of section thirty-three of the Finance Act 1949, but for the aggregate value or amount of the gifts to him exceeding five hundred pounds, then the duty chargeable on such of the gifts to him as would have been so exempted shall not be greater than the sum by which that aggregate value or amount exceeds five hundred pounds; but no reduction under this subsection of the duty chargeable on any property shall affect any reduction of the duty on other property under subsection (3) of section sixteen of the Finance Act, 1894, (as amended by

Part V

—cont.

496

Ch.49

Finance A, 1957

5 & 6 Euz. 2

Part v section thirty-three of the Finance Act, 1954) or under section —cont. thirteen of the Finance Act, 1914.

(12) Where any property is deemed to pass on a death by virtue of section forty-three of the Finance Act, 1940, by reason of a disposition or determination of an interest limited to cease on the death within the meaning of that section, then for the purposes of duty chargeable on the death—

(a) the property in which the interest subsisted shall be

taken to be the property comprised at the time of the death in the settlement under which the interest subsisted, except in so far as that property neither is, nor represents, nor is derived from, property in which the interest subsisted immediately before the disposition or determination; and

(b) for purposes of aggregation the deceased shall be

deemed to have had an interest in the property passing by reason of the disposition or determination, if he at any time had an interest under the said settlement or if the settlement was made by him or made, directly or indirectly, at his expense or out of funds provided by him:

Provided that if the settlement comes to an end at some time before the death of the deceased as respects all or any of the property which on his death immediately before that time would be treated as property in which the interest subsisted, the property in question, other than property to which the deceased then becomes absolutely and beneficially entitled in possession, and any consideration (not consisting of rights under the settlement) given by the deceased for any of the property to which he so becomes entitled shall be treated as comprised in the property in which the interest subsisted (in addition to any other property so comprised) and as being of a principal value, as property so comprised, equal to its principal value at that time.

(13) For the purposes of estate duty on any death, any question whether, in the case either—

(a) of any property comprised in a gift inter vivos; or

(b) of any property in which there subsisted an interest

limited to cease on the death within the meaning of the said section forty-three;

possession and enjoyment of that property was at a particular time assumed or had by any person to the exclusion of any other person shall (so far as the question depends on the identity of the property) be determined by reference to the property

1957

Finance A, 1957

Ch.49

497

which would for the time being be treated, in relation to the death if it occurred at that time, as property comprised in the gift or property in which the interest subsisted, as the case may be.

(14) Where under any trust or power relating to settled property income arising from that property is accumulated, the accumulations shall not be treated for the purposes of subsection

(8) or (12) of this section as derived from that property.

(15) For the purpose of this section the principal value of any property at a time before the death of the deceased shall be ascertained as it would be for purposes of estate duty chargeable on his death if he had died immediately before that time; and any property which for the purposes of estate duty on a death foils by virtue of any provision of this section to be valued as at a time before that death shall, for the purposes of subsection

(10) of section seven of the Finance Act, 1894 (which provides that the same property shall not be twice aggregated or twice charged on the same death), be treated as distinct from the same property falling to be valued as at some other time for purposes of duty on the same death.

(16) Any reference in this section to property comprised in a gift being deemed to pass on a death shall be construed as referring to the conditions under which property so comprised is to be deemed to pass on the death being satisfied, apart from questions as to the identity or existence of the property at the death; and any reference to property being deemed to pass on a death by virtue of section forty-three of the Finance Act, 1940, shall be similarly construed.

(17) This section shall have effect only in the case of a death occurring after it comes into force; but on a death so occurring it shall apply in relation to gifts made and dispositions or determinations effected or suffered at any time, except as provided by the following subsection.

(18) This section, except subsection (11), shall not apply to a gift made, or a disposition or determination effected or suffered, before the tenth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, where—

(a) if the deceased had died at the end of that month and this section had been expressed to apply to a death at that time, duty would by virtue of this section have been chargeable by reason of the gift, or of the disposition or determination, on property not chargeable in accordance with the law then in force, or on a value determined as at a date earlier than under the law then in force; and

(2) Where under a contract or trust scheme so approved there becomes payable on a person's death an annuity to which the said section thirty-five applies, and under the terms of the contract or scheme a sum of money might, at that person's option, have become payable instead to his personal representatives, that sum of money shall not be treated as passing on his death as property of which he was competent to dispose.

1.—(1) Where under subsection (1) of section two hundred and fifty-nine of the Customs and Excise Act, 1952, (which section is referred to below as “ the principal section ”) goods erf any class or description are chargeable with a duty of customs in respect of any article contained in the goods as a part or ingredient of them, and it appears to the Treasury on the recommendation of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise that to charge the duty according to the quantity of the article used in the manufacture or preparation of the goods (as provided by the principal section) is inconvenient and of no material advantage to the revenue or to importers of goods of that class or description, then the Treasury may by order direct that in the case of goods of that class or description the duty chargeable shall be calculated in such of the following ways as may be provided by the order, that is to say, either—

(a) at a rate specified in the order by reference to the weight, quantity or value of the goods ; or

{b) by reference to a quantity so specified of the article, and (where material) on the basis that the article is of such value, type or quality as may be so specified:

Provided that—

(i) if it appears that, in the case of goods of any class or

description, the net amounts payable in the absence of any direction under this paragraph are insignificant, the order may direct that any such goods shall be treated for the purpose of the duty as not containing that article; and

(ii) if it appears that goods of any class or description are substantially of the same nature and use as if they consisted wholly of the article, the order may direct that any such goods shall be treated for the purpose of the duty as consisting wholly of that article.

(2) in making an order under this paragraph in the case of any class or description of goods, the Treasury shall have regard to the quantity and (where material) the type or quality of the article in question appearing to them, on the advice of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, to be ordinarily used in the manufacture or preparation of Roods of that class or description which are imported into the United Kingdom; and for the purposes of this paragraph where articles of a like nature or use are chargeable with distinct duties, the Treasury may treat those articles as different types of the same article and the duties as different heads of the same duty.

The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.

Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.

(1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex. birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.

() the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without .previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognised as indispensable by civilised (peoples.

(2) The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for.

An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict.

The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention.

The application of the preceding provisions shall not affeot the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.

Article 8

The present Convention shall be applied with the co-operation and under the scrutiny of the Protecting Powers whose duty it is to safeguard the interests of the Parties to the conflict. For this purpose, the Protecting Powers may appoint, apart from their diplomatic or consular staff, delegates from amongst their own nationals or the nationals of other neutral Powers. The said delegates shall be subject to the approval of the Power with which they are to carry out their duties.

The Parties to the conflict shall facilitate to the greatest extent possible the task of the representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers.

The representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers shall not in any case exceed their mission under the present Convention. They shall, in particular, take account of the imperative necessities of security of the State wherein they carry out their duties. Their activities shall only be restricted as an exceptional and temporary measure when this is rendered necessary by imperative military necessities.

Article 9

The provisions of the present Convention constitute no obstacle to the humanitarian activities which the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other impartial humanitarian organisation may, subject to the consent of the Parties to the conflict concerned, undertake for the protection of wounded and sick, medical personnel and chaplains, and for their relief.

Article 10

The High Contracting Parties may at any time agree to entrust to an organisation which offers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy the duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers by virtue of the present Convention.

When wounded and sick or medical personnel and chaplains do not benefit or cease to benefit, no matter for what reason, by the activities of a Protecting Power or of an organisation provided for in the first paragraph above, the Detaining Power shall request a neutral State, or such an organisation, to undertake the functions performed under the present Convention by a Protecting Power designated by the Parties to a conflict.

If protection cannot be arranged accordingly, the Detaining Power shall request or shall accept, subject to the provisions of this Article, the offer of the services of a humanitarian organisation, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to assume the humanitarian functions -performed by Protecting Powers under the present Convention.

Any neutral Power, or any organisation invited by the Power concerned or offering itself for these purposes, shall be required to act with a sense of responsibility towards the Party to the conflict on which persons protected by the oresent Convention depend, and

shall be required to furnish sufficient assurances that it is in a position to undertake the appropriate functions and to discharge them impartially.

No derogation from the preceding provisions shall be made by special agreements between Powers one of which is restricted, even temporarily, in its freedom to negotiate with the other Power or its allies by reason of military events, more particularly where the whole, or a substantial part, of the territory of the said Power is occupied.

Whenever in the present Convention mention is made of a Protecting Power, such mention also applies to substitute organisations in the sense of the present Article.

Article 11

In cases where they deem it advisable in the interest of protected persons, particularly in cases of disagreement between the Parties to the conflict as to the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present Convention, the Protecting Powers shall lend their good offices with a view to settling the disagreement.

For this purpose, each of the Protecting Powers may, either at the invitation of one Party or on its own initiative, propose to the Parties to the conflict a meeting of their representatives, in particular of the authorities responsible for the wounded and sick, members of medical personnel and chaplains, possibly on neutral territory suitably chosen. The Parties to the conflict shall be bound to give effect to the proposals made to them for this purpose. The Protecting Powers may, if necessary, propose for approval by the Parties to the conflict a person belonging to a neutral Power, or delegated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, who shall be invited to take part in such a meeting.

CHAPTER II.—WOUNDED AND SICK Article 12

The same shall apply to the emblems mentioned in Article 38, second paragraph, in respect of the countries which use them. The national Red Cross societies and other societies designated in Article 26 shall have the right to use the distinctive emblem conferring the protection of the Convention only within the framework of the present paragraph.

The international Red Cross organisations and their duly authorised personnel shall be permitted to make use, at all times, of the emblem of the Red Cross on a white ground.

Ch. 52

593

Prisoners of war may only be transferred by the Detaining Power 3rd Scb to a Power which is a party to the Convention and after the Detaining —cont. Power has satisfied itself of the willingness and ability of such transferee Power to apply the Convention.

Measures of reprisal against prisoners of war are prohibited.

Article 14

Category V: General officers or prisoners of war of equivalent rank: seventy-five Swiss francs.

However, the Parties to the conflict concerned may by special agreement modify the amount of advances of pay due to prisoners of the preceding categories.

Furthermore, if the amounts indicated in the first paragraph above would be unduly high compared with the pay of the Detaining Power’s armed forces or would, for any reason, seriously embarrass the Detaining Power, then, pending the conclusion of a special agreement with the Power on which the prisoners depend to vary the amounts indicated above, the Detaining Power:

(a) shall continue to credit the accounts of the prisoners with

the amounts indicated in the first paragraph above;

(b) may temporarily limit the amount made available from these advances of pay to prisoners of war for their own use, to sums which are reasonable, but which, for Category I, shall never be inferior to the amount that the Detaining Power gives to the members of its own armed forces.

The reasons for any limitation win be given without delay to the Protecting Power.

Article 61

The Detaining Power shall accept for distribution as supplementary pay to prisoners of war sums which the Power on which the prisoners depend may forward to them, on condition that the sums to be paid shall be the same for each prisoner of the same category, shall be payable to all prisoners of that category depending on that Power, and shall be placed in their separate accounts, at the earliest opportunity, in accordance with the provisions of Article 64.

They shall likewise inform the parties concerned of any subsequent modifications of such measures.

Article 70

Immediately upon capture, or not more than one week after arrival at a camp, even if it is a transit camp, likewise in case of sickness or transfer to hospital or another camp, every prisoner of war shall be enabled to write direct to his family, on the one hand, and to the Central Prisoners of War Agency provided for in Article 123, on the other hand, a card similar, if possible, to the model annexed to the present Convention, informing his relatives of his capture, address and state of health. The said cards shall be forwarded as rapidly as possible and may not be delayed in any manner.

Article 71

Prisoners of war shall be allowed to send and receive letters and cards. If the Detaining Power deems it necessary to limit the number of letters and cards sent by each prisoner of war, the said number shall not be less than two letters and four cards monthly, exclusive of the capture cards provided for in Article 70, and conforming as closely as possible to the models annexed to the present Convention. Further limitations may be imposed only if the Protecting Power is satisfied that it would be in the interests of the prisoners of war con-

If limitations must be placed on the correspondence addressed to prisoners of war, they may be ordered only by the Power on which the prisoners depend, possibly at the request of the Detaining Power. Such letters and cards must be conveyed by the most rapid method at the disposal of the Detaining Power; they may not be delayed or retained for disciplinary reasons.

Prisoners of war who have been without news for a long period, or who are unable to receive news from their next of kin or to give them news by the ordinary postal route, as well as those who are at a great distance from their homes, shall be permitted to send telegrams, the fees being charged against the prisoners of war’s accounts with the Detaining Power or paid in the currency at their disposal.

Such shipments shall in no way free the Detaining Power from the obligations imposed upon it by virtue of the present Convention.

The only limits which may be placed on these shipments shall be those proposed by the Protecting Power in the interest of the prisoners themselves, or by the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other organisation giving assistance to the prisoners, in respect of their own shipments only, on account of exceptional strain on transport or communications.

The conditions for the sending of individual parcels and collective relief shall, if necessary, be the subject of special agreements between the Powers concerned, which may in- no case delay the receipt by the prisoners of relief supplies. Books may not be included in parcels of clothing and foodstuffs. Medical supplies shall, as a rule, be sent in collective parcels.

Article 73

In the absence of special agreements between the Powers concerned on the conditions for the receipt and distribution of collective relief shipments, the rules and regulations concerning collective shipments, which arc annexed to the present Convention, shall be applied.

The other Powers party to the Convention shall bear the cost of transport in their respective territories.

In the absence of special agreements between the Parties concerned, the costs connected with transport of such shipments, other than costs covered by the above exemption, shall be charged to the senders.

The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to reduce, so far as possible, the rates charged for telegrams sent by prisoners of war. or addressed to them.

Article 75

Should military operations prevent the Powers concerned from fulfilling their obligation to assure the transport of the shipments referred to in Articles 70, 71, 72 and 77, the Protecting Powers concerned, the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other organisation duly approved by the Parties to the conflict may undertake to ensure the conveyance of such shipments by suitable means (railway wagons, motor vehicles, vessels, or aircraft, etc.). For this purpose, the High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to supply them with such transport and to allow its circulation, especially by granting the necessary safe-conducts.

—cont. sentatives of the Protecting Powers either through their prisoners*

representative or, if they consider at necessary, direct, in order to draw their attention to any points on which they may have complaints to make regarding their conditions of captivity.

These requests and complaints shall not be limited nor considered to be a part of the correspondence quota referred to in Article 71. They must be transmitted immediately. Even if they are recognised to be unfounded, they may not give rise to any punishment

Prisoners* representatives may send periodic reports on the situation in the camps and the needs of the prisoners of war to the representatives of the Protecting Powers.

Chapter 11.—Prisoners of War Representatives Section 2. Article 79

In aU places where there are prisoners of war, except in those where there are officers, the prisoners shall freely elect by secret ballot, every six months, and also in case of vacancies, prisoners* representatives entrusted with representing them before the military authorities, the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross and any other organisation which may assist them. These prisoners’ representatives shall be eligible for re-election.

In camps for officers and persons of equivalent status or in mixed camps, the senior officer among the prisoners of war shall be recognised as the camp prisoners’ representative. In camps for officers, he shall be assisted by one or more advisers chosen by the officers; in mixed camps, his assistants shall be chosen from among the prisoners of war who are not officers and shall be elected by them.

Officer prisoners of war of the same nationality shall be stationed in labour camps for prisoners of war, for the purpose of carrying out the camp administration duties for which the prisoners of war are responsible. These officers may be elected as prisoners’ representatives under the first paragraph of this Article. In such a case the assistants to the prisoners’ representatives shall be chosen from among those prisoners of war who are not officers.

Every representative elected must be approved by the Detaining Power before he has the right to commence his duties. Where the Detaining Power refuses to approve a prisoner of war elected by his fellow prisoners of war, it must inform the Protecting Power of the reason for such refusal.

In all cases the prisoners* representative must have the same nationality, language and customs as the prisoners of war whom he represents. Thus, prisoners of war distributed in different sections of a camp, according to their nationality, language or customs, shall have for each section their own prisoners’ representative, in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs.

Article 80

Prisoners’ representatives shall further the physical, spiritual and intellectual well-being of prisoners of war.

In particular, where the prisoners decide to organise amongst themselves a system of mutual assistance, this organisation will be within the province of the prisoners* representative, in addition to the special duties entrusted to him by other provisions of the present Convention.

Prisoners* representatives shall not be held responsible, simply by reason of their duties, for any offences committed by prisoners of war.

Article 81

Prisoners’ representatives shall not be required to perform any other work, if the accomplishment of their duties is thereby made more difficult

Prisoners* representatives shall be permitted to visit premises where prisoners of war are detained, and every prisoner of war shall have the right to consult freely his prisoners* representative.

AH facilities shall likewise be accorded to the prisoners* representatives for communication iby post and telegraph with the detaining authorities, the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross and their delegates, the Mixed Medical Commissions and with the bodies which give assistance to prisoners of war. Prisoners* representatives of labour detachments shall enjoy the same facilities for communication with the prisoners* representatives of the principal camp. Such communications shall not be restricted, nor considered as forming a part of the quota mentioned in Article 71.

Prisoners* representatives who are transferred shall be allowed a reasonable time to acquaint their successors with current affairs.

In case of dismissal, the reason therefor shall be communicated to the Protecting Power.

A prisoner of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations and orders in force in the armed forces of the Detaining Power; the Detaining Power shall be justified in taking judicial or disciplinary measures in respect of any offence committed by a prisoner of war against such laws, regulations or orders. However, no proceedings or punishment contrary to the provisions of this Chapter shall be allowed.

If any law, regulation or order of the Detaining Power shall declare acts committed by a prisoner of war to be punishable, whereas the same acts would not be punishable if committed by a member of the forces of the Detaining Power, such acts shall entail disciplinary punishments only.

Article 83

In deciding whether proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by a prisoner of war shall be judicial or disciplinary, the Detaining Power shall ensure that the competent authorities exercise the greatest leniency and adopt wherever possible disciplinary rather than judicial measures.

Article 84

A prisoner of war shall be tried only by a military court, unless the existing laws of the Detaining Power expressly permit the civil courts to try a member of the armed forces of the Detaining Power in respect of the particular offence alleged to have been committed by the prisoner of war.

In no circumstances whatever shall a prisoner of war be tried by a court of any kind which does not offer the essential guarantees of independence and impartiality as generally recognised, and, in particular, the procedure of which does not afford the accused the rights and means of defence provided for in Article 105.

Article 85

Prisoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to capture shall retain, even if convicted, the benefits of the present Convention.

When fixing the penalty, the courts or authorities of the Detaining Power shall take into consideration, to the widest extent possible, the fact that the accused, not being a national of the Detaining Power, is not bound to it by any duty of allegiance, and that he is in its power as the result of circumstances independent of his own will. The said courts or authorities shall be at liberty to reduce the penalty provided for the violation of which the prisoner of war is accused, and shall therefore not be bound to apply the minimum penalty prescribed.

Collective punishment for individual acts, corporal punishment, imprisonment in premises without daylight and, in general, any form of torture or cruelty, are forbidden.

Prisoners of war who have served disciplinary or judicial sentences may not be treated differently from other prisoners of war.

II. Disciplinary Sanctions Article 89

The following may be accommodated in a neutral country:

(1) wounded and sick whose recovery may be expected within

one year of the date of the wound or the beginning of the illness, if treatment in a neutral country might increase the prospects of a more certain and speedy recovery.

(2) prisoners of war whose mental or physical health, according

to medical opinion, is seriously threatened by continued captivity, but whose accommodation in a neutral country might remove such a threat.

The conditions which prisoners of war accommodated in a neutral country must fulfil in order to permit their repatriation shall be fixed, as shall likewise their status, by agreement between the Powers concerned. In general, prisoners of war who have been accommodated

1957

Geneva Conventions , 1957

Ch. 52

627

In either case, the measures adopted shall be brought to the knowledge of the prisoners of war.

The costs of repatriation of prisoners of war shall in all cases be equitably apportioned between the Detaining Power and the Power on which the prisoners depend. This apportionment shall be carried out on the following basis:

(a) If the two Powers are contiguous, the Power on which the prisoners of war depend shall bear the costs of repatriation from the frontiers of the Detaining Power.

(b) If the two Powers are not contiguous, the Detaining Power shall bear the costs of transport of prisoners of war over its own territory as far as its frontier or its port of embarkation nearest to the territory of the Power on which the prisoners of war depend. The Parties concerned shall agree between themselves as to the equitable apportionment of the remaining costs of the repatriation.

Article 119

Repatriation shall be effected in conditions similar to those laid down in Articles 46 to 48 inclusive of the present Convention for the transfer of prisoners of war, having regard to the provisions of Article 118 and to those of the following paragraphs.

Article 17

The Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to conclude local agreements for the removal from besieged or encircled areas, of wounded, sick, infirm, and aged persons, children and maternity cases, and for the passage of ministers of all religions, medical personnel and medical equipment on their way to such areas.

Article 19

The protection to which civilian hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless they are used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts harmful to the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after due warning has been given, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit and after such warning has remained unheeded.

The fact that sick or wounded members of the armed forces are nursed in these hospitals, or the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants and not yet handed to the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy.

(3) Subject to the provisions of this section, any guaranteed price to be determined by the Minister in pursuance of an order under this section shall be determined from time to time in respect of such guarantee periods (being periods of or of approximately twelve months) as may be prescribed by the order, and shall be so determined in the light of the conclusions of the Ministers from the annual review last held before the commencement of the period concerned.

(4) Subject to the following provisions of this part of this Act, any guaranteed price determined by the Minister for a guarantee period in pursuance of an order under this section may be varied by a subsequent determination of the Minister.

(5) An order under this section in respect of any produce described in the First Schedule to this Act may be made so as to apply only to particular descriptions or quantities of that produce, or may make different provision (including in particular provision for the determination of different guaranteed prices) in respect of different descriptions or quantities of that produce; and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision produce may be distinguished for the purposes of any such order by reference—

(b)to works of the following descriptions, that is to say, sewers, drains, and any pipes or wires for the supply of gas, electricity, water, heating, telephone or other comparable services, being either works situated outside any building or structure or works in the nature of mains situated in a building or structure in which they neither begin nor end; or

(c) to any land, not being damage to that land only as the site of an existing building or structure or of existing works such as are mentioned in the two foregoing paragraphs and being damage such as to affect the fitness of that land for use for the purposes mentioned in the next following subsection, caused by the withdrawal of support from land in connection with the lawful working and getting of coal, or of coal and other minerals worked therewith, or the lawful getting of any product from coal in the course of working it, not being—

(i) damage caused in connection with the working and

getting of coal and other minerals where the working and getting of the coal was ancillary to the working of those other minerals; or

(ii) damage caused in connection with the working and

getting of coal or of coal and other minerals by virtue of the grant of a gale in the Forest of Dean or any other part of the Hundred of St. Briavels in the county of Gloucester.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of any subsidence damage the National Coal Board (in this Act referred to as “ the Board ”) shall execute such works (in this Act referred to as “ remedial works ”) as may be necessary to render the damaged property reasonably fit for use for the purposes for which, at the date immediately before the damage occurred, it was or might in all the circumstances reasonably have been expected to be used:

Provided that no works shall be deemed to be necessary as aforesaid over and above such as may be sufficient to render ffie property not less fit for those purposes than it was at that date.

In this subsection the expression “works” includes works of redecoration.

(3) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Board may, instead of executing remedial works under the last foregoing subsection, elect—

(a) to make a payment equal to the cost reasonably incurred

by any other person in executing remedial works; or

(b) in a case where it is proposed to merge the execution

of other works in connection with the damaged property with the execution of any remedial works or to

redevelop, instead of executing remedial works in connection with, the damaged property, to make payments equal to any sums from time to time shown to have been expended by any other person in executing the merged works or, as the case may be, the redevelopment works up to an aggregate amount equal to the expenditure which it is estimated would have been incurred by the Board or by any other person, whichever estimate is the less, in executing remedial works in connection with the damaged property;

and, without prejudice to the next following subsection, the Board—

(i) where the damaged property is a highway maintainable

or repairable by the inhabitants at large or a highway in Scotland managed and maintained by the Secretary of State or by a county or town council; or

(ii) in any case where the execution of remedial works falls

within a duty with respect to the damaged property imposed by virtue of any enactment on a government department, local authority or statutory undertakers in connection with the maintenance of public services; or

(iii) where it is certified by the Minister, on an application made to him by any other person or of his own motion, that in his opinion it is not in the public interest that the Board should themselves execute the remedial works,

shall make the appropriate election under this subsection, and, in any other case where it is proposed to execute such merged works or redevelopment works as aforesaid or where the remedial works required are of a special character not suitable for execution by the Board, shall not unreasonably refuse any request to make the appropriate election under this subsection received from a person entitled to serve a damage notice in respect of the property:

Provided that the Board shall not be deemed to act unreasonably in refusing any such request received after the Board have begun to execute remedial works. 4

(4) Subject to the provisions of this Act, if in the case of any property affected by subsidence damage—

(a) the reasonable cost of executing remedial works would, in the opinion of the Board, exceed the amount of the depreciation in the value of the property caused by the damage; or

ib) the property is a dwelling-house and it appears to the Board that a notice to treat for the compulsory

Ch. 59 Coal-Mining (Subsidence) 5 & 6 Euz. 2

1957

purchase thereof is likely to be served under Part HI of the Housing Act, 1936, or Part HI of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1950 (which relate to clearance and redevelopment) in such circumstances that compensation payable for the purchase will fall, but if the subsidence damage had not occurred would not have fallen, to be assessed subject to subsection (2) or (3) of section forty of the said Act of 1936 or, as the case may be, subsection (2) of section thirty-six of the said Act of 1950 (which provide for compensation by reference to site value); or

(c) the property is a dwelling-house and it appears to the Board that a clearance order under either of the said Parts III is likely to be made in respect thereof in such circumstances that the making of the clearance order will be attributable to the subsidence damage,

the Board may, instead of executing any works or making any payment under the foregoing provisions of this section, elect to make a payment equal to the amount mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection; and if in the case of any dwelling-house affected by subsidence damage the Board do not elect to make a payment under this subsection but, before the completion of remedial works or, in a case falling within paragraph (b) of the last foregoing subsection, before all sums in respect of which the Board are liable to make payments have been expended, a notice to treat is served under either of the said Parts in either in respect of the dwelling-house in such circumstances as are mentioned in paragraph ( b)of this subsection or in respect of the cleared site of the dwelling-house, or a clearance order is made under either of the said Parts III in such circumstances as are mentioned in paragraph (c) of this subsection, then, notwithstanding and without prejudice to any expenditure or liability of the Board in respect of works already executed, the Board shall make a payment in respect of the dwelling-house equal to the amount mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection in like manner as if they had originally elected so to do under paragraph (b) or (c) thereof and shaft be absolved from any further obligations in respect of the dwelling-house under the two last foregoing subsections:

Provided that the Board shall not make a payment under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection—

(i) in respect of subsidence damage to any agricultural land or to any building or structure occupied in connection with such land except after consultation with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or, in the case of property situated in Scotland, the Secretary of State; or

1957

Coal-Mining (Subsidence)

Act, 1957

Ch. 59

957

(ii) in respect of subsidence damage to a dwelling-house except after consultation with the local authority for the purposes of Part II of the Housing Act, 1936, or, in Scotland, for the purposes of the Housing (Scotland)

Act, 1950, in whose area the dwelling-house is situated, and if such a payment is made in respect of a dwelling-house the local authority aforesaid shall not in the exercise of any power to require the repair of that dwelling-house require the execution of any works of repair in respect of that subsidence damage.

(5) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this section, but subject to the provisions of this Act, the Board shall, if works of a temporary nature urgently and reasonably required in order that the damaged property may continue to be used for the purposes for which it was used immediately before the damage occurred or in order to prevent further damage to that property arising from the subsidence damage (in this Act referred to as “emergency works”) have been executed by any other person, make a payment equal to the cost reasonably incurred in executing those works.

(6) Where a dwelling-house is affected by subsidence damage, the provisions of the First Schedule to this Act shall have effect.

(7) The provisions of the Second Schedule to this Act shall have effect for the purpose of determining—

(a) the unit of property to be taken into account for the

purposes of subsection (4) of this section as being affected by subsidence damage;

(b) the amount of the depreciation in the value of any such

unit caused by the damage; and

(c) the persons who are to receive any payments made under

subsection (3), (4) or (5) of this section.

2.—(1) The Board shall not be required to execute any works Notices to be or make any payment under subsections (2) to (5) of the given to or by foregoing section in respect of subsidence damage to anyBoard* property unless the owner of the property or some other person who is liable to make good the damage in whole or in part has given notice in writing to the Board of the occurrence of the damage in such manner, within such time, and containing such particulars, as may be prescribed (in this Act referred to as a “damage notice”) and has afforded the Board reasonable facilities to inspect the property, so far as he was in a position to afford such facilities.

(2) As soon after receiving from any person a damage notice or a request to exercise their power of election under subsection (3) of the foregoing section as is reasonably practicable having regard among other things to the provisions of sections six, nine and ten of this Act, the Board shall consider whether

or not to exercise their powers of election under the said subsection (3) or under subsection (4) of the foregoing section and give notice in writing of their decision to the person aforesaid; and, without prejudice to subsection (3) of the next following section, where the Board have given notice that they elect to make a payment under one or the other of those subsections they shall not revoke that election except with the agreement of all persons to whom they have given notice thereof or who have served on the Board a notice under the next following subsection:

Provided that if the Board serve a notice under subsection <2> of the next following section in respect of any works in connection with the damaged property, the Board shall not be required to serve a notice under this subsection in respect of those works until the notice under the said subsection (2) ceases to be in force in respect thereof.

(3) The Board shall not be required to make any payment under subsection (3) of the foregoing section in respect of any works executed by any other person in connection with any property unless that person has given notice in writing to the Board, in the prescribed manner and, except in such circumstances as may be prescribed, at the prescribed interval before the works are begun, containing adequate particulars thereof, and has afforded the Board reasonable facilities to inspect the property, so far as he was in a position to afford such facilities.

(4) The Board shall not be required to make any payment under subsection (5) of the foregoing section in respect of any emergency works executed by any other person in connection with any property—

(a) unless that person has given to the Board in writing as

soon as was reasonably practicable in all the circumstances notice and adequate particulars of those works, and has afforded the Board reasonable facilities to inspect the property, so far as he was in a position to afford such facilities; or

(b) if the emergency works are executed after the Board

have given notice under subsection (2) of this section that they elect to make a payment in respect of the damaged property under subsection (4) of the foregoing section. 5

(5) Where the Board have given notice under subsection (2) of this section to the person by whom a damage notice was served that they propose to execute remedial works under subsection (2) of the foregoing section, the Board, if so requested by that person at any time before these works are completed, shall give to that person in writing adequate information with respect to any of those works still remaining to be executed.

3.—(1) The next following subsection shall apply in any case Cases where where a damage notice has been served on the Board in respect farther of any property and it appears to the Board to be probable #“IJa0e “ that further subsidence damage will occur to that property within such a period as would make it unreasonable that all or any of the permanent works which would otherwise fall to be executed in connection therewith should be executed for the time being.

(2) In any case to which this subsection applies, the Board may serve on any person to whom, by virtue of any of the foregoing provisions of this Act, they have an obligation in respect of the damage to which the damage notice in question relates notice in writing to the effect that, except for emergency works and except for such other works, if any, as may be specified in the notice, the Board will neither execute any works while the notice remains in force nor make any payment in respect of works executed while the notice remains in force; and, except in such circumstances as may be prescribed, the obligations of the Board to that person by virtue of the foregoing provisions of this Act shall be subject to the terms of that notice:

Provided that it shall be the duty of the Board to revoke any notice given by them under this subsection as soon as works in connection with the property in addition to emergency works and those works, if any, specified in the notice can reasonably be executed, and any person aggrieved by a failure of the Board to specify any works in or to revoke such a notice may apply to the county court or, where the property is situated in Scotland, to the sheriff, and the court or, as the case may be, the sheriff may, if it appears in all the circumstances to be reasonable so to do, order that the notice shall be deemed to specify such additional works as may be specified in the order or, as the case may be, shall cease to have effect, and that order shall come into force when the period for an appeal therefrom expires or, if such an appeal is made, on the date when that appeal is dismissed or abandoned.

(3) Where in the case of any property a damage notice has been served on the Board and before remedial works or any works undertaken in pursuance of an election under paragraph (6) of subsection (3) of section one of this Act have been completed or the aggregate of any sums expended in executing any works undertaken as aforesaid has reached the aggregate amount referred to in that paragraph, and without the Board having given notice under subsection (2) of the last foregoing section that they elect to make a payment under subsection (4) of section one of this Act, further subsidence damage occurs to that property, the damage referred to in the damage notice and that further damage shall be treated as one, and accordingly—

active service or by other circumstances arising by reason of hostilities between His Majesty and any foreign state;

(b) an order may be made notwithstanding that the term of the patent may have been previously extended, or that a new patent for the invention may have been previously granted, by one or more orders made under this section, and notwithstanding that the previous order, or one of the previous orders, may have been made otherwise than pursuant to an application under subsection (6) of this section;

(c) the restriction imposed by subsection (5) of this section on the length of the further term for which a patent may be extended shall not have effect, but the term granted by an order, whether by way of extension or grant of a new patent, shall not exceed ten years, and, where two or more orders are made pursuant to applications under subsection (6) of this section in relation to the same invention, the aggregate of the terms thereby granted, whether by way of extension or grant of a new patent, shall not exceed ten years.“

requiring the continuance, after possession of such land has been taken as aforesaid, of certain services provided by the landlord, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.

[26th March 1942.]

BE it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1. — (1) Where possession of all the land comprised in a lease to which this Act applies has been taken on behalf of His Majesty in the exercise of emergency powers, and the land or the main part thereof was, immediately before possession was so taken, being used by the tenant or by a member of the tenant's family as his residence, or for the purposes of his business, or partly as his residence and partly for the purposes of his business, the tenant may, within three months from the material date, serve on the landlord a notice (in this Act referred to as a “ notice of disclaimer ”) stating that he disclaims the lease:

Provided that a notice of disclaimer shall not be served unless at the time when it is served possession of the land to which it relates is retained in the exercise of emergency powers.

(2) For the purposes of this section—

(a) land shall not be deemed to be used by any person as his residence, if he uses it only as a week-end or holiday residence or resides there only on occasional visits, but the fact that he was not actually residing there immediately before possession of the land was taken as aforesaid shall not necessarily mean that he was not then using the land as his residence;

(6) land shall not be deemed to be used for the purposes of a business, if that business, so far as it was previously carried on there, has been wholly or mainly closed down or transferred to other premises, and the land is no longer used for the purposes of the business except—

(i) as a business address or otherwise for the purpose of preserving business connections, or

(ii) to store furniture, plant or other property not removed from the land, or

(iii) for some other purpose not involving the substantial use of the land.

(3) Where a notice of disclaimer has been served, the landlord may, at any time within one month from the service of the notice, apply to the court to determine whether the notice is of no effect on the ground that the conditions specified in subsection (1) of

1942.

Landlord and Tenant

(<Requisitioned Land) Act, 1942. Ch. 13.

23

this section are not fulfilled, and, if any such application is made, it shall lie with the tenant to show that the said conditions are fulfilled, and, unless it is decided by the court on such an application that the notice is of no effect on the said ground, the said conditions shall be deemed to be fulfilled.

(4) Where possession of part only of the land comprised in a lease has been taken as aforesaid, or possession of part of the land so taken has been given up, and, if all the land had been so taken and retained, the conditions specified in subsection (1) of this section would have been fulfilled in respect thereof, the court may, on the application of the tenant made within three months from the material date, direct that this section shall have effect as if possession had been so taken and retained of all the land comprised in the lease, and shall, if it considers necessary, extend the period within which a notice of disclaimer may be served.

The court shall, in considering any application under this subsection, have regard (among other matters) to the question whether it is reasonably practicable for the occupier to use the part of the land which has not been taken, or is not retained, as a residence, or, as the case may be, for the purposes of his business.

2. — (1) Where a notice of disclaimer has been served, and the Effect of court has not decided under the foregoing section that it is of notice of no effect, the notice shall become effective subject to any order disclaimer, of the court under this section, at the expiration of one month from the service of the notice or, if an application has been made to the court under subsection (3) of the foregoing section, of such further period (if any) as the court may allow.

(2) Where a notice of disclaimer has become effective, the lease disclaimed shall be deemed to have been surrendered as from the material date and all interests in or derived out of the term created by the lease disclaimed shall be deemed to have been extinguished as from the said date.

(3) Where any holding within the meaning of the Agricultural 13 & 14 Geo. 5. Holdings Act, 1923, is disclaimed under this Act, the tenancy c* 9-

shall, for the purposes of sections nine and ten and subsection

(2) of section sixteen of that Act, be deemed to terminate at the date on which the notice of disclaimer becomes effective in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.

(4) Where a notice of disclaimer has been served under this Act, the court may—

(a) on the application of any person having a mortgage or charge in respect of the term created by the lease disclaimed, vest the lease in that person on such terms as the court thinks just, which may include adaptations or modifications of the terms of the lease;

24

Ch. 13.

(Requisitioned Land) Act, 1942.

5 & 6 Geo. 6.

(6) on the application of the landlord or the tenant, make such adaptations or modifications as the court thinks just of any term of the lease relating to repairing obligations and, in particular, require the tenant to pay such sum as it thinks just in respect of any dilapidations which have already occurred and for which the tenant is liable or would (but for the disclaimer) become liable;

(c) on the application of the landlord or the tenant, make such adaptations and modifications as it thinks just of any term of the lease imposing any liability on either party which will take effect on the surrender of the lease;

and any such application may be made at any time before the notice of disclaimer becomes effective.

(5) Within seven days from the service of a notice of disclaimer, the tenant shall serve upon any person having a mortgage or charge in respect of the term created by the lease disclaimed a copy of the notice of disclaimer and the name and address of the landlord, and if he fails to do so, he shall be liable to make good to any such person any damage suffered by that person by reason of the failure.

3. — (1) Where possession of all the land comprised in a multiple lease to which this Act applies has been taken and is retained on behalf of His Majesty in the exercise of emergency powers, and all the separate tenements comprised in the lease are tenements (hereafter in this section referred to as “ disclaimable tenements ”) which the tenant holding under the multiple lease would, if he held them under separate leases, be entitled to disclaim under section one of this Act, he may serve a notice of disclaimer under that section in respect of the lease, and subsection (3) of that section shall apply to any such notice as if the reference to the conditions specified in subsection (1) of that section were a reference to the conditions specified in this subsection, but, save as aforesaid, section one of this Act shall not apply in the case of multiple leases, and the following provisions of this section shall have effect in lieu thereof.

(2) Where possession of one or some of the tenements comprised in a multiple lease, being a disclaimable tenement or disclaimable tenements, has been taken and is retained as aforesaid, and the remainder of the tenements comprised in the lease either have not been taken or are not retained or are not disclaimable tenements, the tenant may, within three months from the material date, apply to the court for permission to serve a notice of disclaimer either in respect of the lease as a whole or in respect of one or more of the separate tenements comprised therein.

Provided that, if the court gives such a direction in a case where possession of any tenement comprised in the lease has not been taken or is not retained as aforesaid, the court may, if it thinks just, direct that the rent payable under the lease and, if the tenement is sub-let, the rent payable under the under-lease shall, notwithstanding the disclaimer, be payable, to such extent as may be directed, in respect of the period beginning with the material date and ending with the date on which the notice of disclaimer becomes effective, and the provisions of this Act relating to the apportionment of rent shall have effect subject to any such direction.

(4) If, on any such application for permission to serve a notice of disclaimer either in respect of the lease as a whole or as respects one or more of the separate tenements comprised therein, the court is satisfied that it is equitable to allow the tenant to disclaim one or more of the separate tenements comprised in the lease, being disclaimable tenements of which possession has been taken and is retained as aforesaid, it shall order that the lease shall be treated as if it were two separate leases, one comprising the tenement or tenements to be disclaimed, and the other comprising the remainder of the tenements, and shall give such consequential directions as to the apportionment of the rent and otherwise as it thinks just, and shall direct that the tenant shall be at liberty to serve, within such period as may be specified, a notice of disclaimer in respect of the lease comprising the said tenement or tenements to be disclaimed.

(5) Where possession of part only of a separate tenement comprised in a multiple lease has been taken as aforesaid, or possession of part only of a separate tenement so taken has been given up, and the tenement is in either case a disclaimable tenement, the court may, if it is satisfied that it is equitable to do so, exercise its powers under this section in like manner as if possession of the whole of the tenement had been taken and retained as aforesaid, and shall, in considering whether to exercise the said powers, have regard (among other matters) to the question whether it is reasonably practicable for the occupier to use the part of the tenement which has not been taken, or is not retained.

(b) though no undertaking can be given as to whether or

not those Commissioners will accept such a settlement in the case of any particular person, it is the practice of the Commissioners to be influenced by the fact that a person has made a full confession of any fraud or default to which he has been a party, and has given full facilities for investigation,

and that he was or may have been induced thereby to make the statements or produce the documents.

Provided that, notwithstanding the making of such an order, a transfer of the licence may be granted on an application made at the meeting at which the order was made or at the first transfer sessions thereafter, and if a transfer thereof is so granted the order shall not have effect.

(2) In relation to an old off-licence or an old on-licence the reference in this paragraph to grounds relating to conduct or fitness of the holder of the licence shall be construed as a reference only to the grounds specified in the Second Part of the First Schedule to the Licensing Act or in the Second Part of the Second Schedule thereto, as the case may be, with the substitution for references therein to the applicant or proposed holder of the licence of references to the holder thereof and for references to the house or shop in respect of which a licence is sought or the applicant applies of references to the licensed premises:

Section 2.

Ch. 28. War Damage (Amendment) 5 & 6 Geo.

Act, 1942.

2. Valuation of licensed premises.

(1) Where war damage is sustained by premises in respect of which a justices' licence within the meaning of the Licensing (Consolidation) Act, 1910, was in force before the occurrence of the damage, any determination required for the purposes of the principal Act relating to the value of the premises or of any interest therein shall be made on the assumption that the validity of the licence, and the prospect of renewal thereof, were, and would remain, unaffected by the damage or by any circumstances connected therewith or any consequence thereof.

(2) In the application of this paragraph to Scotland, for any reference to a justices’ licence within the meaning of the Licensing (Consolidation) Act, 1910, there shall be substituted a reference to a certificate

3. Amendments as to valuation of a hereditament for calculating amount

of value payment.

(1) In subsection (5) of section three (which specifies, amongst other things, the matters subject to which a sale of a hereditament in the open market is to be assumed, for the purposes of the valuation of the hereditament, to be made), for the words from “ any restriction or liability imposed by or under an enactment" to “ other incumbrance ” there shall be substituted the words “any restriction imposed by or under an enactment passed before the passing of this Act, to which the hereditament was subject at that time, but free from any other incumbrance and without regard to any liability of the hereditament to become subject after that time to any restriction by virtue of any enactment".

(2) In the proviso to subsection (5) of section three (which empowers the Treasury to make regulations as to the valuation of certain hereditaments otherwise than by reference to value on a sale in the open market) the words “or having a value which could not be fully realised on such a sale " shall be omitted.

4. Amendments as to determination between cost of works or value pay-

ment for damage to developed hereditament.

(1) In paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section four (which defines damage involving total loss as meaning damage “ such that the making good thereof would be likely to require works costing more than " the difference between the value which the hereditament would have after the execution of the works and the value which the hereditament would have as a site) for the words “such that the making good thereof would be likely to require works costing more than " there shall be substituted the words “such that the proper cost of the works required for reinstating the hereditament in the form in which it existed immediately before the occurrence of the damage would be likely to be more than

(2) For the purposes of the said paragraph (a), the value which a ist Sch.

hereditament would be likely to have shall be taken to be the amount —coni.

which the fee simple therein might be expected to realise on a sale thereof made in the open market, with vacant possession, subject to any right or restriction such as is mentioned in subsection (5) of section three to which the hereditament was subject immediately after the occurrence of the damage, but free from any other incumbrance and without regard to any liability of the hereditament to become subject after that time to any restriction by virtue of any enactment:

Provided that, in the case of hereditaments of a kind for the valuation of which provision is made by regulations made under the proviso to the said subsection (5), such value shall be ascertained by reference to such matters as may be specified in regulations made as therein mentioned.

5. Payments to owners of rentcharges.

(1) Where a value payment is to be made in respect of war damage to a hereditament and at the date by reference to which the disposal of the payment is to be regulated (in this paragraph referred to as “ the material date ”) there was subsisting a rentcharge created out of a proprietary interest (being either the fee simple or a tenancy granted for a term of a hundred years or more) in any land in the hereditament, or in any such land together with other land, a right to receive a share of the value payment shall vest in the person who was the owner of the rentcharge at that date, if he shows that the following conditions are satisfied, namely—

(a) that the amount of the rentcharge so far as attributable to .

land in the hereditament then subject thereto (in this paragraph referred to as “ the charged land in the hereditament ") exceeded the available annual value of that land as depreciated by the war damage; and

(b) that at the time when the question whether this condition is

satisfied falls to be determined no building sufficient to make good the excess has been carried out, or, having regard to all the circumstances (including any undertaking required under paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of section seven), is likely to be carried out within a reasonable period after the time when the discharge of the value payment becomes permissible.

(2) If the said right is exercised—

(a) the amount of the share of the owner of the rentcharge shall be an amount equal to the capital equivalent of the excess mentioned in the preceding sub-paragraph, so however that if the amount of the rentcharge so far as attributable to the charged land in the hereditament was greater by any sum than the available annual value of that land apart from any war damage the amount of the share shall be computed as if the said excess had been reduced by that sum; and

(/>) so much of the rentcharge as is equal to the said excess shall be extinguished on the date on which the share is paid, and, as between the persons interested in the charged land in the hereditament on the one hand and in any other land

M

178 Ch. 28. War Damage (Amendment) 5 & 6 Geo. 6.

Act, 1942.

subject to the rentcharge on the other hand, the proper share of the persons interested in the charged land in the hereditament of the liability for the residue of the rentcharge in respect of any period after the extinguishment shall be treated as being an amount per annum equal to the available annual value of the charged land in the hereditament as depreciated by the war damage.

(3) Any question as to whether the conditions mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph are satisfied, or as to the amount of the said excess or of the share of tho owner of a rentcharge, shall be determined by agreement between the owner thereof and of the proprietary interest out of which the rentcharge was created in the charged land in the hereditament, together with any mortgagee of either of those interests, or, in default of agreement, by reference to a referee as provided by subsection (5) of section nine.

(4) Where the said right is exercised, effect shall be given thereto out of so much of the value payment as is payable in respect of the proprietary interest out of which the rentcharge was created in the charged land in the hereditament, and—

(a) if apart from this provision any of the value payment would be payable under subsection (4) of section nine to a mortgagee of that proprietary interest, then, if the mortgage had priority to the rentcharge, it shall be payable to him and effect shall be given to the said right out of any sums to which the owner of that proprietary interest would otherwise have been entitled under the provisions of that subsection as to mortgagees accounting, or, if the rentcharge had priority to the mortgage, the sum payable to the mortgagee shall be reduced by the amount required for giving effect to the said right;

(b) if the rentcharge was itself subject to a mortgage at the material date, subsection (4) of section nine shall have effect in relation to the disposal of the share to be paid in respect of the rentcharge as it has effect in relation to so much of a value payment as is payable in respect of a mortgaged proprietary interest, with the substitution for references therein to such an interest of references to the rentcharge;

(c) subsections (2) and (4) of section nine, and sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 8 of this Schedule, shall have effect subject to the provisions of this paragraph.

(5) Regulations may be made under section ten (which confers power to make regulations as to claims for payments) as to the exercise of the said right and the manner in which effect is to be given to the said right where exercised, and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by this sub-paragraph, regulations so made may make provision as to the matters aforesaid in cases in which the charged land in a hereditament is a part only thereof, or was in divided ownership at the material date, or in which a proprietary interest or rentcharge was subject to a mortgage at that date.

(6) As regards cases in which the title to a rentcharge, or to land subject thereto, is registered under the Land Registration Act, 1925, such provision may, without prejudice to the generality of section one hundred and forty-four of that Act, be made by rules under that section as may be expedient in consequence of the provisions of this paragraph, and in particular for securing (by the imposition of conditions as to the exercise of the said right or otherwise) that the extinguishment of any of a rentcharge by virtue of this paragraph shall not take effect without notice thereof being entered on the register.

(7) In this Act the expression “rentcharge” means a rentcharge (including a fee farm rent) subsisting at law or capable of subsisting at law, and not being an interest or charge arising under a settlement within the meaning of the Settled Land Act, 1925, and means, where an apportionment of a rentcharge binding on the owner thereof has been made, each of the apportioned parts and not the entire rentcharge.

(8) For the purposes of this paragraph, the “ capital equivalent ” of the excess referred to in head (a) of sub-paragraph (1) shall be taken to be that excess multiplied by the number of years purchase which the rentcharge might have been expected to realise on a sale thereof in the open market on the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, if it had been subsisting on that day with the like incidents in all respects as it had at the material date, and the hereditament had been in the state in which it was immediately before the occurrence of the damage thereto, and the annual value of any land outside the hereditament subject to the rentcharge had been its annual value apart from any war damage.

(9) For the purposes of this paragraph, the " annual value of the charged land in the hereditament as depreciated by the war damage " shall—

(a) if that land is coterminous with the hereditament, be taken

to be five per cent, of the value of the hereditament after the occurrence of the damage as ascertained for the purpose of determining the amount of the value payment;

(b) if that land is a part only of the hereditament, be determined

by apportioning an appropriate part of the said percentage of the said value to that land.

(10) For the purposes of this paragraph, the “ annual value apart from any war damage ” of any land shall, if that land was coterminous with land which constituted a contributory property or two or more contributory properties for the purposes of the instalments of contribution for the year in which the war damage to the hereditament Occurred (or, if it occurred before the beginning of the year nineteen hundred and forty-one, for that year), be taken to be the contributory value or the sum of the contributory values of the property or properties lor that year, and, if it was not, shall be determined by valuation made by reference—

(a) primarily to the contributory value for that year of any such contributory property or properties as aforesaid which that land comprised or of which it formed part; and

(b) subject as aforesaid, to the rent at which that land or any part thereof might have been expected to let from year to year on the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, if it had been on that day in the state in which it was immediately before the occurrence of the damage to the hereditament, or, in the case of land outside the hereditament which had then also sustained war damage, immediately before the occurrence of that damage, and the tenant undertook to pay the usual tenant’s rates and taxes and the landlord undertook to bear the costs of the repairs and insurance and other expenses, if any, necessary to maintain the land in a state to command that rent.

(n) For the purposes of this paragraph, the “ available annual value ” of the charged land in the hereditament as depreciated by the war damage, or apart from any war damage, shall be taken to be the annual value thereof as so depreciated, or apart from any war damage, as the case may be, less the amount, so far as attributable to any of the charged land in the hereditament, of—

(a) any rentcharge having priority to the rentcharge in question to which the fee simple in that land was subject at the material date, or, where that rentcharge was created out of a tenancy of that land, to which either the fee simple therein or that tenancy or any superior tenancy thereof was subject at that date; and

(b) where that rentcharge was created out of a tenancy of that land,

the rent reserved by the lease for the year in which that date fell.

1ST SCH. —coni.

(12) For the purposes of this paragraph, the “amount attributable” to any land of a rentcharge, or of rent reserved by a lease, shall, where at the material date that land was the only land subject to the rentcharge, or out of which the rent issued, be taken to be the whole amount of the rentcharge payable, or of the rent reserved, for the year in which that date fell, and, where it was not, shall be determined by apportioning or allocating to that land so much (if any) of that whole amount as may be appropriate, having regard—

(a) primarily, to any apportionment or allocation of that rent-

charge or rent which may have been made otherwise than so as to be binding on the owner of that rentcharge or on the landlord, as the case may be, before the occurrence of any war damage to any of the land subject to that rent-charge or rent; and

(b) subject as aforesaid, to the proportion borne by the annual

value apart from any war damage of that land to the annual value apart from any war damage of the other land subject to that rentcharge or rent.

(13) In the application of this paragraph to Northern Ireland, there shall be substituted for the reference to the Settled Land Act, 1925, a reference to the Settled Land Acts, 1882 to 1890, and, as regards

boogie

1942. War Damage (Amendment) Ch. 28.

Act, 1942.

cases in which land in Northern Ireland is subject to a rentcharge, the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland may by rules make such provision as may be expedient for securing (by the imposition of conditions as to the exercise of the said right or otherwise) that the extinguishment of any of a rentcharge by virtue of this paragraph shall not take effect without notice thereof being registered in the proper office for the registration of deeds or titles, as the case may require.

6. Payments to superiors and creditors in ground annuals.

(1) The last preceding paragraph shall extend to Scotland subject to the modifications specified in the following provisions of this paragraph.

(2) For any reference to a rentcharge created out of the fee simple in any land there shall be substituted a reference to a feuduty or ground annual payable by the owner of the fee simple in such land; references to the owner of a rentcharge shall be construed accordingly; and references to a rentcharge created out of a tenancy shall not apply.

(3) The right conferred by sub-paragraph (1) on a superior or the creditor in a ground annual to receive a share of a value payment shall not be exercisable until—

(a) in the case where the feuduty or ground annual is payable in

respect of the charged land in the hereditament and also of other land, the part of such feuduty or ground annual attributable to the charged land in the hereditament has been allocated thereon; and

(b) the feuduty or ground annual or the part thereof so allocated,

as the case may be, in so far as it exceeds the annual value of the charged land in the hereditament as depreciated by the war damage, has been discharged.

(4) Where for the purposes of this paragraph a feuduty or a ground annual is required to be allocated or a feuduty or a ground annual or a part thereof so allocated is required to be discharged, the superior or the creditor in the ground annual shall execute and record in the appropriate register of sasines—

(a) a memorandum specifying the sum to be allocated and

describing particularly or by reference the land on which it is to be allocated; or, as the case may be,

(b) a discharge of the feuduty or ground annual or part specifying the extent to which the same is discharged and describing particularly or by reference the land so disburdened;

and any such allocation or discharge shall be binding on all having interest.

7. Form of payment where making good is wholly or partly abandoned or hereditament is compulsorily acquired.

(1) Where the appropriate payment for war damage to a hereditament would apart from this provision be a payment of cost of works, if the Commission are satisfied that it is the wish of all the owners of proprietary interests for the time being subsisting in the hereditament and of rentcharges (if any) to which it is subject and of any mortgagee of any such interest, or of any of the persons aforesaid whose wish ought in the opinion of the Commission to prevail, that the damage or any part of it should not be made good, or if they are satisfied that the circumstances are such that the damage or any part of it will not in fact be made good, they may, notwithstanding any previous determination of the kind of payment to be made in respect of the damage to the hereditament, make a payment or payments in respect thereof as follows and of such amounts respectively, not exceeding the following, as they may think fit, that is to say—

(a) in respect of the damage so far as made good, a payment of

cost of works of an amount equal to so much of the proper cost of the works executed for the making good thereof as falls within the permissible amount mentioned in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section three;

(b) in respect of the damage so far as not made good, a value

payment of an amount computed in other respects as provided by section three but, in a case in which any works the subject of a payment under this paragraph have been executed, as if all those works could have been and had been executed immediately after the occurrence of the damage and the depreciation in the value of the hereditament had fallen to be ascertained by reference, as regards the state of the hereditament after the damage, to its state immediately after the execution thereof.

(2) Where the appropriate payment for war damage to a hereditament would apart from this provision be a payment of cost of works, if land constituting or forming part of the hereditament, or an interest in such land, is acquired compulsorily by virtue of any enactment, whether passed before or after the passing of the principal Act or of this Act, or is acquired by agreement by a person authorised by virtue of any such enactment to acquire it compulsorily, then, notwithstanding any previous determination of the kind of payment to be made in respect of the damage to the hereditament,—

In relation to any such acquisition as aforesaid references to the date of the acquisition shall be construed as references to the earliest date after the occurrence of the damage on which any such action as the following is taken, namely, the service of a notice to treat for the acquisition of or of an interest in land constituting or forming part of the hereditament, the taking of any other action by virtue of which the acquisition of or of an interest in such land becomes obligatory, or the making of an agreement for the acquisition of or of an interest in such land without any such notice having been served or any other such action having been taken.

(3) The principal Act shall have effect as if the preceding provisions of this paragraph had been inserted in subsection (2) of section four in substitution for paragraph (a) of that subsection, and section sixteen shall be omitted:

(5) Where a value payment is made under this paragraph, subsection (3) of section nine shall have effect in relation thereto as if the depreciation in the value of each interest in the hereditament had fallen to be ascertained, as regards the state of the hereditament after the damage, as provided by head (6) of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph in relation to the ascertainment of the depreciation in the value of the hereditament.

(6) Where both a payment of cost of works and a value payment are made under this paragraph, subsection (6) of section three and paragraph 1 of this Schedule (which relate to the reduction of payments by reference to the value of articles becoming available as materials) shall not have effect in relation to both payments to the full extent, but the appropriate reduction in respect of the value of any articles shall be made in one or other of the payments or partly in one and partly in the other as the Commission may determine.

(2) The disposal of the payment shall be regulated by reference to the title to the hereditament at the date of the determination of the Commission to exercise that power, or at the date of the acquisition, as the case may be (in this paragraph referred to as “ the material date ”), and accordingly the payment and the interest thereon shall be paid—

(a) if no proprietary interest other than the fee simple was subsisting

in the hereditament or in any part thereof on the material date, to the person who was then the owner of the fee simple therein; or

(b) in any other case, to the persons who were on the material date

the owners of the several proprietary interests then subsisting in the hereditament, or in any part thereof, which were depreciated in value by reason of the war damage, in shares proportionate to the amount of the depreciation in value to which they were respectively subject by reason thereof.

(3) For the purposes of the last preceding sub-paragraph, the depreciation in value to which an interest was subject by reason of war damage shall be taken to be the difference between—

(a) the amount that an interest similar to that interest, sub-

sisting in the hereditament on the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, with the like incidents (subject, so far as relevant, to the specified exceptions) as that interest had immediately before the material date, might have been expected to realise on a sale thereof in the open market on the said thirty-first day of March if the hereditament had been on that day in the state in which it was immediately before the occurrence of the damage; and

(b) the amount that an interest so subsisting might have been

expected to realise on such a sale if the hereditament had been on that day in the state by reference to which, as regards its state after damage, the depreciation in the value of the hereditament is ascertained for the purpose of computing the amount of the value payment in question;

and those amounts respectively shall be determined as provided by subsection (5) of section nine in relation to the determination of the value of a proprietary interest in a hereditament.

1942. War Damage (Amendment) Ch. 28.

Act, 1942.

The. specified exceptions referred to in this sub-paragraph are the following, that is to say,—

(i) each of the said amounts shall be determined without regard

to the fact of the interest’s being subject to any mortgage or floating charge or to any rentcharge;

(ii) each of the said amounts shall be determined without regard

to the fact of the interest's being affected by any restriction imposed on the hereditament by or under an enactment passed after the passing of the principal Act or by any liability of the hereditament to become subject to any restriction by virtue of any enactment;

(iii) the said amount referred to in head (a) shall be determined without regard to incidents arising under the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (War Damage) Acts, 1939 and 1941;

(iv) the said amount referred to in head (6) shall be determined, as respects incidents so arising, by reference to the incidents so arising which in fact attach to the interest whether before or after the material date, except that, where a conditional notice of retention has been served and the interests both of the landlord and of the tenant are acquired as mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) of the last preceding paragraph, that amount shall be determined as if the notice had not been conditional.

(4) The principal Act shall have effect as if the provisions of the two last preceding sub-paragraphs had been inserted in section nine after subsection (3) thereof, and those provisions shall accordingly have effect subject to the provisions of subsection (4) thereof.

(5) If any person makes application to the Commission in that behalf and shows that, having regard to any agreement made during the period between the occurrence of the damage and the passing of this Act as to the disposal of any payment which might be made in respect of the damage, or to any transaction or disposition entered into or made, or contained in a will or codicil executed, during that period on the assumption that a particular kind of payment would be made in respect of the damage or that any payment to be made in respect thereof would be disposed of in a particular way, or to any other circumstances occurring during that period, the disposal of the payment in accordance with the preceding provisions of this paragraph would involve .serious injustice to him, the Commission may dispose of the whole or any part of the payment or of any share thereof as if subsection (2) of section nine had had effect in relation thereto or otherwise as may appear to them to be just and equitable in all the circumstances.

The Commission may make orders as to the costs of the parties on applications under this sub-paragraph and as to the parties by whom such costs are to be paid, and may tax or settle the amount of the costs to be paid under any such order or direct in what manner they are to be taxed, and any such order may be enforced in like mannerjas an order of a referee as to costs made under the Second Schedule.

Foreign Office, S.W.i.

27th July, 1942.

Your Excellency,

Following the discussions which have taken place between representatives of our two Governments, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are prepared, subject to the necessary Parliamentary authority, to give effect to the desire of the Government of the United States that the Service courts and authorities of the United States Forces should, dining the continuance of the conflict against our common enemies, exercise exclusive jurisdiction in respect of criminal offences which may be committed in the United Kingdom by members of those Forces, and they are ready to introduce in Parliament the necessary legislation for this purpose.

2. It is appreciated, however, that cases may arise where for particular, reasons the American authorities may prefer that their courts should not exercise the above jurisdiction, and His Majesty's Government would accordingly propose that in any case in which a written communication to that effect is received from the Diplomatic Representative of the United States it should he open to the appropriate British authority to restore the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom to deal with that case.

3. In view of the very considerable departure which the above arrangements will involve from the traditional system and practice of the United Kingdom there are certain points upon which His Majesty’s Government consider it indispensable first to reach an understanding with the United States Government. I have accordingly the honour to invite Your Excellency to be so good as to lay the following enquiries and observations before your Government and to inform me of their attitude thereupon.

4. In the first place, the readiness of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to agree to the exercise by United States Service courts of exclusive jurisdiction in respect of offences ty

1942- United States of America Ch. 31.

(Visiting Forces) Act, 1942.

members of their Forces is based upon the assumption that the United States Service authorities and courts concerned will be able and willing to try and, on conviction, to punish all criminal offences which members of the United States Forces may be alleged on sufficient evidence to have committed in the United Kingdom, and that the United States authorities are agreeable in principle to investigate and deal with appropriately any alleged criminal offences committed by members of the United States Forces in the United Kingdom which may be brought to their notice by the competent British authorities, or which the American authorities may find to have taken place.

5. Secondly, His Majesty’s Government will be glad if Your Excellency will confirm their understanding that the trial of any member of the United States Forces for an offence against a member of the civilian population would be in open Court (except where security considerations forbade this) and would be arranged to take place promptly in the United Kingdom and within a reasonable distance from the spot where the offence was alleged to have been committed, so that witnesses should not be required to travel great distances to attend the hearing.

6. Thirdly, His Majesty’s Government propose that no member of the United States Forces should be tried in the United Kingdom by a Service Court of the United States of America, for an offence committed by him before 7th December, 1941.

7. Fourthly, while His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. would not wish to make the arrangements in regard to jurisdiction over members of the United States Forces in this country dependent upon a formal grant of reciprocity in respect of United Kingdom Forces in the territory of the* United States of America, I feel that Your Excellency will appreciate that the considerations which have convinced His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom that the interests of our common cause would be best served by the arrangements which they are prepared to make as regards jurisdiction over American forces in the United Kingdom would be equally applicable in the case of British forces which in the course of the war against our common enemies may be stationed in territory under American jurisdiction. It would accordingly be very agreeable to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom if Your Excellency were authorised to inform me that in that case the Government of the United States of America will be ready to take all steps in their power to ensure to the British forces concerned a position corresponding to that of American forces in the United Kingdom under the arrangements which His Majesty’s Government are willing to make. The considerations indicated in paragraph 2 above would naturally apply and His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to authorise the Diplomatic Representative of His Majesty in the United States to notify the competent American authorities in cases where the appropriate British authorities preferred not to exercise jurisdiction.

8. Fifthly, the proposal to ensure to the United States Service courts and authorities by legislation the exclusive exercise of jurisdiction in respect of criminal offences by members of the United States Forces

Ch. 31. United States of America 5 & 6 Geo. 6.

(Visiting Forces) Act, 1942.

in the United Kingdom is based upon the further assumption that satisfactory machinery will be devised between the competent American and British authorities for such mutual assistance as may be required in making investigations and collecting evidence in respect of offences which members of the United States Forces are alleged to have committed, or in which they are alleged to be concerned. His Majesty's Government have no doubt that the United States Government will agree that it would as a general rule be desirable that such preliminary action should be taken by the British authorities, on behalf of the American authorities, where the witnesses or other persons from whom it is desired to take statements are not members of the United States Forces. Conversely, His Majesty’s Government trust that they may count upon the assistance of the American authorities in connexion with the prosecution before British courts of persons who are not members of the United States Forces where the evidence of any member of these Forces is required or where the assistance of the American authorities in the investigation of the case (including the taking of statements from the American Forces) may be needed.

9. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are prepared to extend the proposed legislation where necessary to British Colonies and Dependencies under their authority, other than those British territories in which are situated the United States Military and Naval Bases leased in pursuance of the Agreement of 27th March, 1941, where the question of jurisdiction is already regulated by that Agreement. I accordingly propose that the foregoing paragraphs of this note, and your eventual reply, should be regarded as extending also to the arrangements to be made in the British Colonies and Dependencies to which the proposed legislation may be applied.

10. Finally, His Majesty’s Government propose that the foregoing arrangements should operate during the conduct of the conflict against our common enemies and until six months (or such other period as may be mutually agreed upon) after the final termination of such conflict and the restoration of a state of peace.

11. If the foregoing arrangements are acceptable to the United States Government, I have the honour to propose that the present note and Your Excellency's reply be regarded as constituting an agreement between the two Governments to which effect shall be given as from the date on which the legislation to which I have already referred takes effect.

I have the honour to be.

With the highest consideration,

Your Excellency's obedient servant,

Anthony Eden.

Sir,

I have the honor to refer to your note of July 27, 1942, in which you inform me that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom is prepared, subject to the necessary Parliamentary authority, to give effect to the desire of the Government of the United States that American authorities have exclusive jurisdiction in respect to criminal offences which may be committed in the United Kingdom by members of the American Forces. I now have the honor to inform you that my Government agrees to the several understandings which were raised in your note.

In order to avoid all doubt, I wish to point out that the Military and Naval authorities will assume the responsibility to try and on conviction to punish all offences which members of the American Forces may be alleged on sufficient evidence to have committed in the United Kingdom.

It is my understanding that the present exchange of notes is regarded as constituting an agreement between the two Governments to which effect shall be given as from the date on which the necessary Parliamentary authority takes effect.

Accept, Sir, the renewed assurance of my highest consideration.

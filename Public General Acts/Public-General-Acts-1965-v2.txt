(6) Section 53(5) of this Act applies to any order under this section which designates an area as the site of a proposed new town, and to certain orders for extending the area of a new town.

(4) Before making an order under this section providing for the transfer of functions from or to a development corporation or for the exercise of any functions by such a corporation, the Minister shall consult with that corporation.

(4) References in this paragraph to a decrease in net receipts shall be construed as references to the amount by which a balance of receipts over expenditure is decreased, or a balance of expenditure over receipts is increased, or, where a balance of receipts over expenditure is converted into a balance of expenditure over receipts, as references to the aggregate of the two balances; and references to an increase in net receipts shall be construed accordingly.

(5) In this paragraph “proceeding giving rise to compensation” means the particular action (that is to say, the acquisition, the extinguishment of a right or the imposition of a requirement) in respect of which compensation falls to be assessed, as distinct from any development or project in connection with which that action may have been taken.

(2) For the purposes of any proceedings arising before the Lands Tribunal in respect of compensation falling to be ascertained as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) above, the provisions of sections 2 and 4 of the Land Compensation Act 1961 shall apply as they apply 1961 c. 33. to proceedings on a question referred to the Tribunal under section 1 of that Act, but with the substitution in section 4 of that Act, for references to the acquiring authority, of references to the person from whom the compensation is claimed.

An Act to make new provision for securing the attendance of witnesses in criminal proceedings before courts of assize and quarter sessions; to abolish the binding over of prosecutors for the purpose of such proceedings; to restrict the issue of subpoenas for securing the attendance of witnesses before magistrates’ courts; and for connected purposes.

[5th August 1965]

(2) Where it appears to the court, after taking into account any representation made by the accused or the prosecutor, that the attendance at the trial of any witness is unnecessary on the ground that his evidence is unlikely to be required or is unlikely to be disputed, then—

(a) any witness order to be made by the court in his case shall be a conditional order requiring him to attend the trial if notice in that behalf is given to him and not otherwise; and

1567

(b) if a witness order other than a conditional order has previously been made by the court in his case, the court shall direct that that order be treated as a conditional order.

(3) A magistrates’ court on committing any person for trial shall inform him of his right to require the attendance at the trial of any witness in respect of whom a conditional witness order, or an order treated as a conditional witness order, has been made, and of the steps he must take for the purpose of enforcing the attendance.

(4) Section 5 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1952 (which 1952 c. 55, requires a magistrates’ court acting as examining justices to bind

over witnesses to attend and give evidence before the court at which the accused is to be tried and also to bind over the prosecutor to prosecute the accused before that court) shall cease to have effect, but without prejudice to any recognisance entered into under that section before the commencement of this Act.

(3) The provisions of Schedule 1 to this Act shall have effect in relation to applications under the last foregoing subsection.

3. —(1) Any person who without just excuse disobeys a witness Punishment order or witness summons requiring him to attend before any

Further process to secure attendance of witness.

4.—(1) If a judge of the High Court is satisfied by evidence on oath that a witness in respect of whom a witness order or witness summons is in force is unlikely to comply with the order or summons, the judge may issue a warrant to arrest the witness and bring him before the court before which he is required to attend:

Provided that a warrant shall not be issued under this subsection in the case of a witness subject to a conditional witness order unless notice has been given requiring him to attend the trial, nor in the case of a witness subject to a witness summons unless the judge is satisfied by such evidence as aforesaid that the witness is likely to be able to give material evidence or produce any document or thing likely to be material evidence in the proceedings.

(2) Where a witness who is required to attend before a court of assize or quarter sessions by virtue of a witness order or a witness summons fails to attend in compliance with the order or summons, that court may—

(a) in any case, cause to be served on him a notice requiring him to attend the court forthwith or at such time as may be specified in the notice;

(b) if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he has failed to attend without just excuse, or if he has failed to comply with a notice under paragraph (a) above, issue a warrant to arrest him and bring him before the court.

(3) A witness brought before a court in pursuance of a warrant under this section may be remanded by that court in custody or on bail (with or without sureties) until such time as the court may appoint for receiving his evidence or dealing with him under section 3 of this Act; and where a witness attends a court in pursuance of a notice under this section the court may direct that the notice shall have effect as if it required him to attend at any later time appointed by the court for receiving his evidence or dealing with him as aforesaid.

Provisions 5.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this section, if at

supplementary the time when a witness is arrested under section 4 of this Act he to s*4* cannot forthwith be brought before the court of assize or quarter

sessions specified in the warrant because that court is not being held, the warrant shall have effect as if it directed him to be brought before a magistrates’ court for the place where he is arrested; and that court shall commit him to custody or release him on bail (with or without sureties) until he can be brought or appear before that court of assize or quarter sessions.

Witnesses) Act 1965

Ch. 69

1569

(2) If the judge or court issuing a warrant in respect of any witness under section 4 of this Act is of opinion that it is appropriate to do so, the judge or court may endorse the warrant for bail, and in any such case—

(a) on the arrest of the witness under the warrant he shall,

unless he can forthwith be brought before the court specified in the warrant, be taken to a police station; and

(b) the officer in charge of the station shall release him from

custody if he, and any sureties required by the endorsement and approved by the officer, enter into recognisances of such amount as may be fixed by the endorsement, conditioned for the appearance of the witness before the court specified in the warrant; and

(c) subsection (1) above shall not apply except where the witness is unable to secure his release in accordance with this subsection.

(3) If a court issuing a warrant in respect of any witness under section 4(2) of this Act is of opinion that the evidence of the witness can be dispensed with but that consideration should be given to dealing with him under section 3 of this Act, it may endorse the warrant as issued for the purposes of the said section 3, and in any such case—

(a) the magistrates’ court shall not commit a witness to custody under subsection (1) above unless satisfied that the court specified in the warrant will be held within seven days after the date of the committal; and

(b) if not so satisfied the magistrates' court may, instead of

releasing him on bail, commit him to custody to be brought before a judge of the High Court or a commissioner of assize, and that judge or commissioner shall in respect of the witness have all the powers of the court under section 3 of this Act.

(4) Where a witness appears before a court in pursuance of a recognisance entered into under section 4(3) of this Act or this section, the court may enlarge his recognisance and those of his sureties, if any, to any later time appointed by the court for receiving the evidence of that person or dealing with him under section 3 of this Act.

(5) Without prejudice to the enforcement of any recognisance entered into as aforesaid, section 4 of this Act shall apply to any witness who fails to attend before a court in compliance with such a recognisance as it applies to a witness who fails to attend in obedience to a witness order or witness summons, and the foregoing provisions of this section shall have effect accordingly.

Pensions (Increase) Act 1965

Further increase of certain pensions.

1965 c. 74.

(2) Subsections (2) to (6) of section 1 of the Act of 1959 (which describe the conditions for the increase of a pension under that section) shall apply to the increase authorised by this section as they apply to the increase authorised by subsection (1) of that section.

(3) In subsection (1) of this section, the expression “ adjusted rate ”, in relation to any pension, means the aggregate annual rate of that pension after any relevant increase thereof apart from that subsection, any fraction of a pound in that aggregate being treated as a whole pound.

2.—(1) In relation to any period beginning on or after the appointed day—

(a) for the purposes of this Act, section 1 of the Act of 1956, the Act of 1959 and the Act of 1962, a pension computed under section 13(2X6) of the Superannuation Act 1965 (which provides for pensions of re-employed civil servants to be computed on emoluments before re-employment where those emoluments are higher than subsequent emoluments) shall be deemed to begin on the day following the last day of the service by reference to the emoluments of which the pension falls to be computed and not on the day following the last day of the service in respect of which the pension is payable; and

(b) the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section

shall have effect where a person has, after being in receipt of a pension specified in Schedule 1 to this Act or after having terminated his service in circumstances such that he is or may become eligible for such a pension at a later date, rendered further service by virtue of which the basic rate of that pension has fallen (or if that service had been terminated by retirement would have fallen) to be reassessed.

(2) Where any such pension as is referred to in subsection (1)(6) of this section is a pension specified in paragraph 1, 4 or 5 of Part I of the said Schedule 1 and the reassessment falls to be made by reference to—

(a) the aggregate of the further service and the previous service of the person in question; and

(b) emoluments attributed to a period immediately pre-

ceding the termination of the further service not lower than the emoluments by reference to which the basic rate of the pension was assessed before, or, as the case may be, would have been assessed but for, the rendering of the further service.

Pensions (Increase) Act 1965

Ch. 78

1769

then if in the case of the reassessed pension or any other pension derived therefrom the aggregate of the basic rate of the reassessed or, as the case may be, derived pension and any relevant increases thereof falls short of what the aggregate of the basic rate of the pension falling to be reassessed (or, as the case may be, of the like other pension derived therefrom) and any relevant increases thereof would have been if—

(i) the service rendered before the date of the retirement

or termination of service which gave rise to the receipt of, or eligibility for, the pension falling to be reassessed had been increased by the amount of the further service; and

(ii) no further service had been rendered after that date,

the reassessed or, as the case may be, derived pension may be further increased by the pension authority by the amount of the difference.

(3) Where, in the case of any such pension as is referred to in the said subsection (l)(b) which has been reassessed or any other pension derived therefrom, subsection (2) of this section does not apply but the aggregate of the basic rate of the reassessed or, as the case may be, derived pension and any relevant increases thereof falls short of what that aggregate would have been if the further service had not been rendered, the reassessed or, as the case may be, derived pension may be further increased by the pension authority by the amount of the difference.

(4) In the foregoing provisions of this section—

(a) the expression “ basic rate ”, in relation to any pension, means the annual rate of that pension apart from any relevant increase thereof or any increase thereof under this section;

(b) the expression “ reassessment ”, in relation to a pension which was not assessed before the rendering of the further service but which in consequence of the rendering of that service has or would have fallen to be assessed on a different basis, includes the assessment on that basis, and the expression “ reassessed ” shall be construed accordingly;

(c) any reference to another pension derived from a reassessed pension shall be construed as a reference to another pension the basic rate of which falls to be computed by reference to (or to what, if the further service had been terminated by retirement, would have been) the basic rate of the reassessed pension, not being such another pension granted in consideration of the surrender of part of the reassessed pension.

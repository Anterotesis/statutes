Now, therefore, we, Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom in Parliament assembled do most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

and may provide that where a person ceases to be a member of a police force in order to undertake compulsory national service, the period, of his compulsory national service and such further period, if any, as may be specified in the regulations may be treated, in such manner, to such extent and on such conditions as to contributions or otherwise as may be so specified, as a period of service as a member of a police force.

(3) Regulations made under this section may contain such consequential or incidental provisions as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient, including, in particular, provision as to the cases in which pensions are to be varied, suspended or terminated, or are to be applied otherwise than by being paid to the persons to whom they were awarded.

(4) Without prejudice to the generality of the preceding provisions of this section, regulations made under this section may contain such provision as appears to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient in relation to a person who transfers from or to service in a police force to or from other service or employment, whether in a police force or not, including provisions enabling that other service or employment to be reckoned in whole or in part as service in a police force and provisions authorising or requiring payments to be made by or to the person or into or out of the fund out of which a pension may become or might have become payable to or in respect of the person in question as a member of a police force, including payments of contributions, payments of transfer values, payments towards the burden of a pension payable by another person or out of another fund, or other payments directed to the creation or preservation of pension rights of the person in question.

tions to an existing member of a police force who ceases to be a member of that police force either—

(i) after having served for any period prescribed by those regulations; or

(ii) by reason of infirmity of mind or body after having served for any shorter period so prescribed, not being infirmity due to injury received in the. execution of his duty,

In this subsection, the expression “ existing member,’* in relation to any police force, means a person who is serving in that police force at the date when the regulations in question come into force.

(2) Regulations made under the said section one shall not be invalid by reason that in fact they do not secure the results specified in the preceding subsection, but if the Secretary of State is satisfied, or it is held by the High Court or by the Court

And whereas it is adjudged necessary that a body of air forces should be continued for the purposes aforesaid, and that the whole number of such forces should consist of three hundred and twenty-five thousand:

secure advances from time to time on current account or otherwise, the debentures shall not be deemed to have been redeemed by reason only of the account of the company having ceased to be in debit whilst the debentures remained so deposited.

(4) The re-issue of a debenture or the issue of another debenture in its place under the power by this section given to, or deemed to have been possessed by, a company, whether the re-issue or issue was made before or after me commencement of this Act, shall be treated as the issue of a new debenture for the purposes of stamp duty, but it shall not be so treated for the purposes of any provision limiting the amount or number of debentures to be issued:

Provided that any person lending money on the security of a debenture re-issued under this section which appears to be duly stamped may give the debenture in evidence in any proceedings for enforcing his security without payment of the stamp duty or any penalty in respect thereof, unless he had notice or, but for his neghgence, might have discovered, that the debenture was not duly stamped, but in any such case the company shall be liable to pay the proper stamp duty and penalty.

And whereas section forty-five of the Companies Act, 1928, amended the said section one hundred and four so as to

Provide (amongst other things) that the said person should ave the same priorities as if the debentures had never been redeemed, but saved, in the case of debentures redeemed before, but re-issued after, the date of the commencement of that Act (that is to say, the first day of November, nineteen hundred and twenty-nine), the rights and priorities of persons under mortgages and charges created before that date:

Now, therefore, where any debentures which were redeemed before the said first day of November have been re-issued after that day and before the commencement of this Act, or are re-issued after the commencement of this Act, the re-issue of the debentures shall not prejudice and shall be deemed never to have prejudiced any right or priority which any person would have had under or by virtue of any such mortgage or charge as aforesaid if the said section one hundred and four, as originally enacted, had been enacted in this Act instead of the last foregoing section.

An Act to amend the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts relating to matters affected by certain International Conventions adopted at Seattle in the year nineteen hundred and forty-six.

[13th July 1948.]

T^T WHEREAS at a session of the International Labour ▼ V Conference held at Seattle in the year nineteen hundred and forty-six certain Conventions were adopted, dealing respectively with crew accommodation on board ship, the certification of able seamen, food and catering for crews on board ship, the certification of ships’ cooks, and social security for seafarers:

And whereas it is expedient to make such amendments in the law relating to merchant shipping as will enable effect to be given to those Conventions or certain parts thereof, and otherwise to amend the Merchant Shipping Acts with respect to matters dealt with by those Conventions:

Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

Crew Accommodation and Food and Catering.

1.—(1) The Minister may, after consultation with such Accommoda-organisation or organisations as appear to him to be representation for tive both of owners of British ships and of seamen employed seamon* therein, make regulations with respect to the crew accommodation to be provided in ships of any class specified in the regulations, being ships in respect of which such regulations are authorised to be made by the next following section. 2

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing subsection, regulations made thereunder may, in particular—

(a) prescribe the minimum space per man which must be

provided in any ship to which the regulations apply by way of sleeping accommodation for seamen and apprentices, and the maximum number of persons by whom any specified part of such sleeping accommodation may be used;

(b) regulate the position in any such ship in which the crew

accommodation or any part thereof may be located, and the standards to be observed in the construction, equipment and furnishing of any such accommodation;

(c) require the submission to a surveyor of ships of plans and

specifications of any works proposed to be carried out

Act, 1948.

11 & 12 Geo. 6

for the purpose of the provision or alteration of any such accommodation, and authorise the surveyor to inspect any such works;

(d) provide for the maintenance and repair of any such accommodation, and prohibit or restrict the use of any such accommodation for purposes other than those for which it is designed;

and may make different provision in respect of different classes of ships and in respect of crew accommodation provided for different classes of persons.

(3) In this Act the expression “ crew accommodation ” includes sleeping rooms, mess rooms, sanitary accommodation, hospital accommodation, recreation accommodation, store rooms and catering accommodation provided for the use of seamen and apprentices, not being accommodation which is also used by or provided for the use of passengers :

Provided that regulations made under this section may provide that any store rooms comprised in the crew accommodation of a ship shall, to such extent as may be prescribed by the regulations, be disregarded in estimating the space to be deducted from the tonnage of the ship under section seventy-nine of the principal Act in respect of crew accommodation.

(4) If the provisions of any regulations made under this section are contravened in the case of a ship, the owner or master of the ship shall be liable to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.

Application of 2.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, regulations

Provided that, subject to che provisions of any Order in Council made under section nine of this Act, such regulations shall not apply to any ship under construction which is being constructed at any place in His Majesty’s dominions outside the United Kingdom or in any foreign country or territory in which His Majesty has for the time being jurisdiction, or is intended on her first registration to be registered at any such place.

(2) Where any ship to which regulations made under section one of this Act apply was a British ship registered in the United Kingdom immediately before the date on which those regulations came into force, then, unless and until, after that date, the ship is re-registered in the United Kingdom or undergoes substantial structural alterations or repairs (not being repairs carried out in consequence of damage or in an emergency)—

(a) any requirements of the regulations (including any subsequent regulations amending or substituted for those regulations) relating to matters specified in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section one of this Act (in this section referred to as “ the construction requirements ") shall be deemed to be complied with in the case of the ship if the corresponding requirements of the law in force immediately before that date are so complied with; and

(b) any requirements of any such regulations relating to matters specified in paragraph (c) of the said subsection

(2) (in this section referred to as “ the survey requirements ") shall not apply to any works other than works proposed to be carried out for the purpose of any such alterations or repairs as aforesaid.

(3) Where regulations made under section one of this Act become applicable—

practicable, the Minister shall have regard to the age of the ship, to the purpose for which she is or is intended to be used and to the nature of any alterations or repairs which are carried out, or to the extent to which the construction of the ship had been completed before the date on which the regulations came into force, as the case may be.

(5) Where any such certificate is issued by the Minister as aforesaid, then, subject to compliance with such conditions, if any, as may be specified in the certificate—

(a) the construction requirements of the regulations (including any subsequent regulations amending or substituted for those regulations) shall be deemed to be complied with in the case of the ship; and

Provided that on the occurrence of any such event as is mentioned in the said subsection (2), the provisions of this subsection shall cease to have effect in relation to the ship, but without prejudice to the issue of a further certificate under subsection (3) of this section.

(2) If, upon any such inspection, the surveyor is satisfied that the crew accommodation complies with the regulations, he shall (except where the inspection is made in consequence of a complaint) give to the registrar of British ships a certificate specifying as space deductible under section seventy-nine of the principal Act the whole of the space comprised in that accommodation, except any part thereof required by the regulations to be disregarded in estimating the space so to be deducted. 3

(3) If, upon any such inspection, it appears to the surveyor that the accommodation does not comply in all respects with the regulations, he may give to the registrar a certificate specifying as space deductible as aforesaid such part of the space comprised in the accommodation as he considers appropriate having regard to the extent to which it complies with the regulations, but if

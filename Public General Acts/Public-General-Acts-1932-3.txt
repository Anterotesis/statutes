(3) The account shall show the proportions in which the

Board on the one hand and the amalgamated railway companies as a group on the other hand would be entitled to participate in the net receipts so ascertained on the basis of a fair and equitable distribution and shall show in addition the proportions in which each of the amalgamated railway companies respectively would be so entitled to participate in the portion of those receipts applicable to the amalgamated railway companies as a group.

(4) The proportions so ascertained are in this Schedule referred to as “ the standard proportions.”

fourth day of June, nineteen hundred and thirty-eight,

and no longer.

(2) As from the twenty-ninth day of September,

nineteen hundred and thirty-three, the principal Acts shall not apply to any dwelling-house unless it' is a

dwelling-house to which they applied immediately before the passing, of this Act or then formed part of such a

dwelling-house, and it is also a dwelling-house of which either the annual amount of the recoverable rent on the appointed day or the rateable value on the appointed day did not exceed—

(a) in the metropolitan police district or the City of London, forty-five pounds;

(b) in Scotland, .forty-five pounds;

(c) elsewhere, thirty-five pounds.

(3) Where any dwelling-house to which the principal

house to which those Acts cease to apply as from. the following day by virtue of the provisions of this section shall be entitled to retain possession of the dwelling-

house until the date specified in a notice served upon the tenant under this subsection by or on behalf of the landlord after the passing of this Act, and shall be so entitled in like manner and subject to the like terms and conditions as if the principal Acts had not ceased to apply to the dwelling-house.

Any notice served under this subsection shall be in writing and shall inform the tenant, either that he is required to give up possession of the dwelling-house on the date specified in the notice, or that he will be so required unless before that date an agreement for a new tenancy has been made between the tenant and the landlord, 'so, however, that the date specified in any such notice shall be not earlier than the twenty-ninth day of September, nineteen hundred and thirty-three,

and not earlier than one month after the service of the notice.

(5) The acceptance of rent or mesne profits by the landlord after the date Specified in a notice served in respect of any dwelling-house under the last foregoing subsection shall not affect the validity of the notice,

and if any such notice contains or is accompanied by an offer in writing of the terms upon which the landlord is willing to grant a new tenancy of the dwelling-house,

and a written statement that, if the tenant retains possession of the dwelling-house after the date aforesaid without having made an agreement with the landlord on any other terms, he will by virtue of this Act be deemed to do so upon the terms so offered as aforesaid,

(b) the landlord has, under section two or section four of that Act, served on the .tenant notice that he is willing and able to grant to the tenant or obtain the grant to him of a renewal of the tenancy,

so much of the last foregoing subsection as provides that in the circumstances therein mentioned the tenant of a dwelling-house will, if he retains possession thereof after the expiration of a notice requiring him to give up possession, be deemed to do so upon terms offered by the landlord, shall not apply. *

(7) Part II of the Act of 1923 (which contains provisions as to restrictions after the expiry of the principal Acts) is hereby repealed.

Certain 2.—(1) Subject as hereinafter provided, section dwelling- two of the Act of 1923 (which provides for the exclusion houses not of dwelling-houses from the application of the principal

Acts. 1 day did not exceed—

(a) in the metropolitan police district or the City of London, twenty pounds;

(b) in Scotland, twenty-six pounds five shillings;

(c) elsewhere, thirteen pounds:

Provided that the said section two shall apply to any such dwelling-house which consists of a part of premises whereof the rateable value on the appointed day exceeded the respective amount aforesaid, if the letting which constituted that part a separate dwelling-

house to which the principal Acts apply was a subletting effected by a person who at the date of the subletting was entitled by virtue of the Rent Restrictions Acts'to retain possession of the premises in which the sublet part was comprised, or would have been so entitled if he had not then had some other right to retain possession. *

1933. 1 Rent and Mortgage Ch. 32. 513

Interest Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1933 *

(2) If the landlord of any dwelling-house let as

a separate dwelling immediately before the passing of this Act, being a dwelling-house of which the rateable value on the appointed day did not exceed the respective amount mentioned in the last foregoing subsection,

claims that by virtue of the provisions of the said section two of the Act of 1923 the principal Acts had ceased to apply to the dwelling-house before the passing of this Act, he shall within three months after the passing of this Act make to the council of the county borough or county district in which the dwelling-house is situated application in the prescribed form for the registration of the dwelling-house, and if in any proceedings with respect to any dwelling-house which is, or immediately before the passing of this Act formed part of, such a

dwelling-house as aforesaid, it is proved that but for the provisions of the said section two of the Act of 1923 the principal Acts would have applied to the dwelling-house and that no such application has been made by or on behalf of the landlord within the time aforesaid, the dwelling-house shall, subject as hereinafter provided, be deemed to be a dwelling-house to which the principal

Acts apply:

Provided that if, on application to the county court of the district in which the house is situated,

the court certifies that there was reasonable excuse for the failure to make application for the registration of the dwelling-house within the time aforesaid and application for registration is made within seven days after the certificate has been granted, then, if the principal

Acts had ceased to apply to the dwelling-house before the passing of this Act, section two of the Act of 1923

shall, notwithstanding anything in the last foregoing subsection, apply to the dwelling-house as from the date on which the application for registration is made.

(3) For the purposes of this section it shall be the duty of the council of every county borough and of every county district to make and keep a register

(which shall be open to public inspection at the office of the council during the usual office hours) and to register therein every dwelling-house with respect to which application is duly made in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(4) Any such council as aforesaid shall, on application being made to them by any person in that behalf,

issue, on payment of a fee not exceeding one shilling, a

certificate with respect to any dwelling-house in their borough or district stating whether or not the dwelling-

house is registered under this section and, if registered,

the date of registration; and any such certificate shall,

unless the contrary is proved, be evidence that application for registration of the dwelling-house has or has not been made by or on behalf of the landlord and, in the case of a certificate of registration, be evidence of the date before which such application was made, so however that neither a certificate of registration nor other proof of the registration of any premises under this section shall be received as evidence as to whether or not the premises consist of or include a dwelling-house to which the principal Acts apply.

Any document purporting to be a certificate issued under this subsection by a council named therein, and to be signed by an officer of that council, shall be received in evidence and be deemed to be such a certificate without further proof unless the contrary is shown.

(5) If in any proceedings the court determines that any dwelling-house registered under this section is a

dwelling-house to which the principal Acts apply, it shall be the duty of the registrar or clerk of the court to inform the council by whom the dwelling-house was registered,

and, upon being so informed, that council shall forthwith cancel the registration of the dwelling-house, so,

however, that the registration shall be restored if the decision of that court is reversed on appeal:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply to any dwelling-house with respect to which a certificate has been granted under subsection (2) of this section, unless the court has determined that the principal Acts had not ceased to apply to the dwelling-house before the passing of this Act.

(6) If any person, with intent to deceive, knowingly makes any false statement calculated to lead to the belief that a dwelling-house of which the rateable value on the appointed day did not exceed the respective amount mentioned in subsection (1) of this section is,

by virtue of the provisions of the said section two of the

Act of 1923, not a dwelling-house to which the principal

Acts apply, he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and imprisonment.

3.—(1) No order or judgment for the recovery of possession of any dwelling-house to which the principal

Acts apply or for the ejectment of a tenant therefrom shall be made or given unless the court considers it reasonable to make such an order or give such a

judgment, and either—

(a) the court has power so to do under the provisions set out in the First Schedule to this Apt; or

(b) the court is satisfied that suitable alternative accommodation is available for the tenant or will be available for him when the order or judgment takes effect.

(2) A certificate of the housing authority for the area in which the said dwelling-house is situated, certifying that the authority will provide suitable alternative accommodation for the tenant by a date specified in the certificate, shall be conclusive evidence that suitable alternative accommodation will be available for him by that date.

(3) Where no such certificate as aforesaid is produced to the court, accommodation shall be deemed to be suitable if it consists either—

(a) of a dwelling-house to which the principal Acts apply; or

(b) of premises to be let as a separate dwelling on terms which will, in the opinion of the court,

afford to the tenant security of tenure reasonably equivalent to the security afforded by the principal Acts in the case of a dwelling-house to which those Acts apply,

and is, in the opinion of the court, reasonably suitable to the needs of the tenant and his family as regards proximity to place of work, and either—

(i) similar as regards rental and extent to the accom-

' modation afforded by dwelling-houses provided

in the neighbourhood by any housing authority for persons whose needs as regards extent are,

in the opinion of the court, similar to those of the tenant and his family; or

(ii) otherwise reasonably suitable to the means of the tenant and to the needs of the tenant and his family as regards extent and character.

(4) For the purposes of the last foregoing subsection any certificate of a housing authority stating—

(a) the extent of the accommodation afforded by dwelling-houses provided by it to meet the needs of tenants with families of such number as may be specified in the certificate; and

(b) the amount of the rent charged by it for dwelling-houses affording accommodation of that extent,

shall be conclusive evidence of the facts so stated.

(5) Any document purporting to be a certificate of

a housing authority named therein issued for the purposes of this section and to be signed by the clerk to that authority shall be received in evidence and be deemed to be such a certificate without further proof unless the contrary is shown.

4.—(1) Notwithstanding anything in the last foregoing section, an order or judgment for the recovery of possession of a dwelling-house to which the principal

Acts apply or for the ejectment of a tenant therefrom may be made or given where the court considers it reasonable so to do, if the court is satisfied that the rent charged after the passing of this Act by the tenant for any sublet part of the dwelling-house which is also a

dwelling-house to which the principal Acts apply Was in excess of the recoverable rent of that part..

(2) Where, in any proceedings under the last foregoing subsection for the recovery of possession of a dwelling-

house or for the ejectment of a tenant therefrom, it appears to the court that neither an apportionment of standard rent as between the dwelling-house and the sublet part thereof nor a determination of the recoverable rent of the sublet part has previously been; made by

1933. Rent and Mortgage Ch. 32.

Interest Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1933.

the county court, the court shall make such an apportionment or determination, whether or nob an order or judgment is made or given for the recovery of possession or the ejectment of the tenant.

(3) Where an apportionment of standard rent has been made by the county court as between a dwelling-

house to which the principal Acts apply and any sublet part thereof which is also a dwelling-house to which the principal Acts apply, or where the comity court has determined the recoverable rent of any such sublet part, then, if, after the apportionment or determination,

the rent charged after the passing of this Act by the tenant for that sublet part is in excess of the recoverable rent of that part, the tenant shall, unless he proves that he did not know and could not by reasonable enquiry have ascertained that the rent charged by him was so in excess as aforesaid or that the excess was solely due to an accidental miscalculation, be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.

(4) Where the tenant of a dwelling-house to which the principal Acts apply has sublet any part thereof which is also a dwelling-house to which the principal

Acts apply, the tenant shall within fourteen days after the subletting, or, in the case of a subletting effected before the date of the passing of this Act, within three months after that date, supply the landlord with a

statement in writing of the subletting giving particulars of occupancy, including the rent' charged, and if without reasonable excuse he fails to do so or supplies a statement which is false in any material particular, he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten pounds:

Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords and the Chairman of Ways and Means in the

House of Commons (in this Act referred to as the

Chairmen) shall take such representation into their consideration, and, if they shall be of opinion that the said powers or some of them would more properly be obtained by the promotion of a

. objections to any of the provisions of the Order which have been stated in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time.

(2) If it appears from the report of the

Chairmen that in their opinion the provisions or some of the provisions of the draft Order relate to matters outside Scotland to such an extent, or raise questions of public policy of such novelty and importance, that they ought to be dealt with by Private Bill and not by Provisional Order, the

Secretary for Scotland shall, without further inquiry, refuse to issue the Provisional Order, so far as the same is objected to by the Chairmen.

(3) A copy of every report by the Chairmen in pursuance of this section shall as soon as possible be laid before both Houses of Parliament.

(4) If the Secretary for Scotland shall refuse to issue the Provisional Order or part thereof in pursuance of the provisions of this section,

Order shall, subject to Standing Orders, be held to have been published and served and made for a Private Bill applying for similar powers:

Provided that the petitioners shall, by notice served in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time, inform all opponents of their intention to proceed by way of Private Bill, and,

subject to Standing Orders, the petition for the

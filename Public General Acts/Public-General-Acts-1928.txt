of currency and bank-notes, and the issue in the Irish

Free State of bank-notes other than those authorised by

And whereas the banks specified in the Schedule to

this Act are the banks carrying on banking business in

this Act in respect of the sale of an article,

that he had purchased the article in question

as the same in nature, substance and quality as

no reason to believe that the article was otherwise than

that demanded by the prosecutor.

Specification of the Test Apparatus.

General.

The apparatus to be employed shall be the Abel Petroleum

Testing apparatus or the Abel apparatus modified by having

an oil cup provided with a stirrer. It shall be constructed to

the dimensions herein specified within the limits of accuracy

. prescribed by the tolerances set forth below.

1928. Petroleum Ch. 32.

(Consolidation) Act, 1928.

• The Oil Cup.

The oil' cup .consists of a cylindrical vessel open at the top

and fitted on the outside with a flat circular flange projecting

at right angles.

Within the cup, fixed through the wall and silver soldered

u or brazed in place, there is a gauge consisting of a piece of wire

bent upwards and terminating in a point.

The Cover.

The cup is provided with a close-fitting cover with a downward projecting rim barely reaching the flange on the cup.

The downward projecting rim is made solid -with the top or

silver soldered or brazed in place. Upon the cover are mounted a

thermometer socket, trunnions to support an oil-test lamp, a pair

of guides in which a slide moves, and a white bead. The top of the

cover is pierced by three rectangular holes symmetrically placed

on a diameter, one in the centre and the other two as close as

practicable to the inner sides of the cover-rim and opposite each

other. These three holes are covered or uncovered by means

of a slide moving in suitably disposed guides. The slide has two

perforations, one corresponding in all particulars to the centre

hole in the cover and the other to one of the holes at the side.

The movement of the slide is restricted by suitable stops, and its

length and the disposition of the holes are such, that at the outer

extremity of the movement of the slide, the holes in the cover

are simultaneously just completely opened and at the inner

extremity of the movement of the slide they are completely

closed.

The trunnions supporting the test lamp are fixed on the

top of the guides and the lamp is mounted in the trunnions so

that it is free to oscillate. The lamp is provided with a jet to

contain a wick and is so # arranged that when the slide is moved

so as to uncover the holes, the oscillating lamp is caught by a

The flame then occupies a central position within the hole in

both directions.

A suitably mounted gas-jet may be substituted for the lamp.

The thermometer socket is in the form of a split tube, mounted

on a diameter at right angles to the diameter through the

centres of the holes, and fitted at such an angle as to bring the

bulb of the thermometer, when in place, vertically below the

centre of the cover and at the correct distance from it.

Cover fitted vrith stirrer.

Provision may be made in the cover for the reception of a

stirrer which projects into the oil cup, for use with viscous

materials only.

A bush is mounted on the cover in a position diametrically

Opposite the thermometer mounting and its length is such and it

is set at such an angle that the stirrer rod clears the oil-level

gauge and the blades operate below the level of and without

fouling the thermometer bulb. The bush is placed as near as

practicable to the outer edge of the cover.

The stirrer consists of a round stem having four blades or

vanes silver soldered in place at one end. A collar is fixed on the

stem so that when the stem is inserted into the bush from below,

it is arrested at a position such that the correct length protrudes

into the oil cup. The top end of the stem is reduced and screwed.

A long sleeve having an internally screwed, knurled knob

soldered to its upper end, is passed over the upper end of the stem

and screwed home. The length of the sleeve is such that a flatfaced collar at its lower end just comes into contact with the upper

end of the bush, leaving the stirrer free to rotate without

appreciable vertical play.

A flat-headed cylindrical plug is provided for insertion in

the bush when the stirrer is not in use.

Heating Vessel.

The heating vessel or bath consists of two flat-bottomed

cylindrical copper vessels placed coaxially one inside the other

and soldered at their tops to a flat copper ring, greater in outside

diameter than the larger vessel and of smaller inside diameter

than the smaller vessel. The space between the two vessels is

thus totally enclosed and is used as a water jacket.

An ebonite or fibre ring of right-angle section is fitted into

the hole in the centre of the flat ring forming the top of the

bath and, when the apparatus is in use, the oil cup fits into,

and its flange rests upon, this ebonite or fibre ring so that the

oil cup is centrally disposed within the heating vessel. The

ebonite or fibre ring is secured in place by means of six small

screws having their heads sunk below the surface of the ring,

to avoid metallic contact between the bath and the oil cup.

A split socket, similar to that on the cover of the oil cup,

but set vertically, allows a thermometer to be inserted into the

water-space. A funnel and overflow pipe also communicate with

the water-space through the top plate and two loop handles are

provided thereon.

either by means of apparatus constructed in accordance with the

specification contained in Part I of this Schedule, or by means

of apparatus constructed in accordance with the specification

contained in the First Schedule to the Petroleum Act, 1879, and

verified and stamped by the Board of Trade.

2. The test apparatus shall be placed for use in a position

where it is not exposed to currents of air or draughts.

3. The heating vessel or water-bath shall be filled by

pouring water into the funnel until it begins to flow out at the

spout of the vessel. The temperature of the water at the

beginning of the test shall be 130 degrees Fahrenheit and no

heat shall be applied to the water-bath during the test. When

a test has been completed and it is desired to make another test

the water-bath shall be again raised to 130 degrees Fahrenheit

which may conveniently be done while the petroleum cup is

being emptied, cooled and refilled with a fresh sample to be

tested. The next test is then proceeded with.

4. If an oil test-lamp is being used it shall be prepared

by fitting it with a piece of flat plaited candle-wick, ' and

filling it with colza or rape-oil up to the lower edge of the

opening of the spout or wick tube. The lamp shall be trimmed

so that when lighted it gives a flame of about 0*16 of an inch

diameter, and this size of flame, which is represented by the

projecting white bead on the cover of the oil-cup, is readily

maintained by simple manipulation from time to time with

a small wire tr imme r. A gas test-lamp may be employed, and

if so, the size of the jet of flame shall be adjusted to the size laid

down above.

6. The bath having been raised to the proper temperature,

the cup shall be placed on a level surface in a good light and the

oil to be tested shall be poured into it, until the level of the liquid

just reaches the point of the gauge which is fixed in the cup.

Before a test is begun the temperature of the oil shall be

determined and shall be brought to approximately 60 degrees

Fahrenheit. The cover, with the slide closed, shall then be put

on to the cup and pressed down so that its edge rests on the rim

of the cup, and the cup shall be placed into the bath or heating

vessel, every care being taken to avoid wetting the sides of the cup with the oil. The thermometer in the lid of the cup

has been adjusted so as to have the correct immersion when

the brass collar of the thermometer is properly seated, and its

position shall not in any circumstances be altered. When the

cup has been placed in the proper position, the scale of the

thermometer faces the operator.

6. The test-lamp shall then be placed in position upon the

lid of the cup. When the temperature has reached 66 degrees

Fahrenheit the operation of testing shall be begun, the test flame

being applied once for every rise of one degree, in the following

manner:—

The slide shall be slowly drawn open while a metronome,

set so as to beat at the rate of 76 to 80 beats in the

minute, beats three times and shall be closed during the

fourth beat. A pendulum of 24 inches effective length

may be used in place of the metronome, counting one

beat from one extremity of the swing to the other.

FIRST SCHEDULE.

Address presented to His Majesty by the Legislative Council and House of Assembly of

Newfoundland.

To the King’s Most Excellent Majesty:

Most Gracious Sovereign:

We, Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the

Legislative Council and Assembly of Newfoundland, humbly

approach Your Majesty praying that—

Whereas in the present emergency Your Majesty’s Island of

Newfoundland is unable from its own resources to defray the

interest charges on the public debt:

And whereas the Royal Commission appointed by Your

Majesty’s Warrant bearing the date the seventeenth day of

February, 1933, to examine into the future of Newfoundland has

recommended that for the time being, until such time as the

Island may become self-supporting again, the administration of the Island should be vested in His Excellency the Governor

acting on the advice of a specially created Commission of Government and that during such period Your Majesty’s Government in

the United Kingdom should assume general responsibility for the

finances of Newfoundland and should, in particular, make such

arrangements as may be deemed just and practicable with a view

to securing to Newfoundland a reduction in the present burden

of public debt:

And whereas Your Majesty’s Government in the United

Kingdom have signified their readiness subject to the approval

of Parliament to accept the recommendations of the Royal

Commission and have made detailed proposals for carrying those

recommendations into effect:

Now, therefore, Your Majesty may be graciously pleased to

suspend the Letters Patent under the Great Seal bearing the date

at Westminster the Twenty-eighth day of March, 1876, and

Letters Patent under the Great Seal bearing the date at Westminster the Seventeenth day of July, 1905, and to issue new

Letters Patent which would provide for the administration of the

Island, until such time as it may become self-supporting again,

on the basis of the recommendations which are contained in the

1933.

Newfoundland Act, 1933.

Report of the Royal Commission and of which a summary is set

out in the Annex hereto:

And further that Your Majesty may be graciously pleased

to cause to be laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom

at its present Session such a measure as may enable them to be

given immediate effect.

Annex.

Extract from Report of Royax, Commission appointed by

His Majesty’s Warrant bearing date the seventeenth day of February, nineteen hundred and

thirty-three .

We therefore recommend that the Newfoundland Government, recognising that it is impossible for the Island to surmount

unaided the unprecedented difficulties that now confront it, should

make an immediate appeal for the sympathetic co-operation of

Your Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in the

adoption and execution of a joint plan of reconstruction, of

which the following would be the main features :—

(a) The existing form of government would be suspended

until such time as the Island may become self-supporting

again.

(b) A special Commission of Government would be created

which would be presided over by His Excellency the

Governor, would be vested with full legislative and

executive authority, and would take the place of the

existing Legislature and Executive Council.

(c) The Commission of Government would be composed of

six members, exclusive of the Governor, three of whom

would be drawn from Newfoundland and three from

the United Kingdom.

(d) The Government Departments in the Island would be

divided into six groups. Each group would be placed

in the charge of a Member of the Commission of Government, who would be responsible for the efficient working

of the Departments in the group, and the Commission

would be collectively responsible for the several Departments.

(e) The proceedings of the Commission of Government

would be subject to supervisory control by Your

Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and the

Governor-in-Commission would be responsible to the

Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in the United

Kingdom for the good government of the Island.

(f) Your Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom

would, for their part, assume general responsibility for

the finances of the Island until such time as it may

people of Newfoundland, would be restored.

An Act to amend the law with regard to the

enforcement of enactments prohibiting the use

that may be imposed in Scotland for other

offences in connection with sea fisheries; and for

purposes connected therewith.

[17th May 1934.]

Penalties

for illegal

trawling.

BE it enacted by the Ring’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

as follows:—

1.—(1) Any person who is guilty of illegal trawling

shall be liable, on summary conviction,

(a) to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or

to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three

months; and

1934.

Illegal Trawling

Ch. 18.

103

(b) on a second conviction, to a fine not exceeding

two hundred pounds or to imprisonment for a

period not exceeding six months; and

(c) on a third or subsequent conviction, to both

such last mentioned fine and imprisonment.

(2) Any superintendent of the herring fishery or

other officer employed in the execution of the Herring

Fishery (Scotland) Acts may seize any net and gear

(exclusive of warps) used or attempted to be used for

the purpose of illegal trawling. Any net and gear so

seized shall be forfeited to the Fishery Board for Scotland

if the owner of the vessel in or from which such net or

gear was used or attempted to be used as aforesaid shall

be convicted of illegal trawling or of an offence under

subsection (3) of this section in respect of such use or

attempted use, and if there shall be no such conviction

the owner of such net and gear shall be entitled to

recover them and to compensation for any damage

occasioned to them by the seizure.

(3) Where any vessel is used for the purpose of

illegal trawling and the skipper of such vessel at the date

of such offence is a person who has, within the immediately preceding two years, been convicted of illegal

trawling, or who has been so convicted within the immediately preceding five years and has been more than

once so convicted, the owner of the vessel shall be guilty

of an offence, and shall be liable on summary conviction

to a fine not exceeding, on a first conviction one hundred

and fifty pounds, on a second conviction two hundred

and fifty pounds, and on a third or subsequent conviction

five hundred pounds:

Provided that it shall be a good defence to any

charge under this subsection, if it is proved that, at the

commencement of the voyage during which the first

mentioned offence was committed the fist required by

subsection (6) of this section to be kept at mercantile

marine offices did not include the previous conviction

or convictions of illegal trawling founded on in the

charge.

(4) Where any penalty imposed on the owner of a

vessel in pursuance of the immediately preceding subsection falls to be, or is ordered to be, recovered by civil

diligence, such penalty may, without prejudice to any

method of execution authorised by section forty-nine

of the Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland) Act, 1908, be

levied by distress or poinding and sale of the vessel in

like manner as if it were a sum directed to be so levied

under section six hundred and ninety-three of the

Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.

(5) Where a penalty is imposed on the owner of a

vessel in pursuance of subsection (3) of this section, the

court may make an order directing that the vessel be

detained until such penalty is paid, and thereupon the

provisions of section six hundred and ninety-two of the

Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, shall apply to such vessel

in like manner as they apply to a ship which is to be

detained under that Act.

(6) The clerk of the court by whom any person shall,

after the passing of this Act, be convicted of illegal

trawling shall send particulars of such conviction to

the Board of Trade and to the Fishery Board for Scotland, and the Board of Trade shall take such steps as

may to them seem necessary to secure that a list containing the names of the persons who have been so

convicted and particulars of such convictions is available

at each mercantile marine office for inspection by the

owner of any fishing boat or his authorised representative.

(7) For the purpose of any reference in subsection (1)

of this section to a second, or third, or subsequent conviction, and for the purposes of subseption (3) of this

section, no account shall be taken of any conviction of

illegal trawling dated before the passing of this Act.

2. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, it shall be lawful for a court

in Scotland on convicting any person of a contravention

of any regulations for the registering lettering and

numbering of British Sea Fishing Boats made by Order

in Council under Part IV of that Act to sentence such

person to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding sixty days or where such

conviction is a second or subsequent conviction, to a

fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months.

applied by section five of this Act shall, in the case of a

conviction in Scotland, have effect as if the words “two

hundred poupds ” were substituted for the words “fifty

pounds.”

4. —(1) While any vessel carrying trawling gear is

within any area in which the methods of fishing known

as beam trawling and otter trawling are illegal by virtue

of section six of the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act,

1889, or of any byelaw for the time being in force of the

the net shall be inboard.

(2) In the event of a contravention of the foregoing

provisions of this section, the skipper of the vessel shall

be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction

to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds.

5. For the purpose of the enforcement of the enactments relating to illegal trawling, sections twelve and

fourteen of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1883 (which relate to

powers and protection of sea fishery officers) shall apply

modifications:—

(a) the places at which and the apparatus and method by

which tests are to be made to ascertain whether any

undertakers or non-statutory undertakers are supplying gas in conformity with the requirements of

any enactment for the time being in force as to the

calorific value, purity, pressure or composition of the

gas; and

(b) in the case of thermal unit undertakers in whose case

intermittent tests are prescribed, the frequency of the

tests and the manner of distribution of all or any of the tests throughout the quarter; and

appointed, and to the undertakers or non-statutory

undertakers, as the case may be, to whom the reports

relate, and the means by which the results of the tests

are to be made available to the public:

Provided that any testing place provided by thermal unit

undertakers in pursuance of any special or other Act of Parliament

relating to the undertaking shall, unless otherwise agreed between

the undertakers and the local authority by whom the gas

examiner was appointed, be deemed to be a prescribed testing

place under this section, but the Board of Trade may, if they

think fit, prescribe any additional testing place in respect of that

undertaking.

(2) The prescribed apparatus shall, in the case of any

thermal unit undertakers who have sold in the preceding year

more than five million therms in the form of gas, and in the case

of any other thermal unit undertakers, if it appears to the Board

of Trade to be necessary, include a calorimeter for the production

of a continuous record of the calorific value of the gas which is

being supplied.

(3) All undertakers and non-statutory undertakers shall

provide and maintain to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade

the testing places prescribed in their case and shall give any gas

examiner access to any such testing place for the proper execution

of his duty.

(4) All thermal unit undertakers shall provide and maintain

to the satisfaction of the Board the apparatus prescribed in

their case.

(5) On any occasion on which the gas examiner tests the

gas supplied by undertakers or non-statutory undertakers, a

representative of the undertakers or non-statutory undertakers,

as the case may be, may be present, and a representative of

thermal unit undertakers may be present on any occasion on

which the gas examiner inspects, alters, adjusts, or replaces the

testing apparatus provided by them, but no such representative

shall in any way interfere with the test or with the inspection,

alteration, adjustment or replacement of the apparatus.

For the purposes of this subsection, the gas examiner shall,

in cases where the testing place is situated elsewhere than on

the works of the undertakers or non-statutory undertakers, give

them reasonable notice of the time at which he will attend at

the testing place.

(6) A person authorised in writing by the Board of Trade

may at any time, where it appears to the Board necessary for

the proper execution of their duties under this section, enter

upon and inspect the works of any undertakers or non-statutory

undertakers, and the undertakers or non-statutory undertakers,

186

2nd Sch,

Act, 1934.

as the case may be, shall afford that person full facilities for

that purpose and shall furnish the Board of Trade with such

information with regard to the position of their mains and pipes,

and with regard to any other matter, as the Board of Trade may

reasonably require.

(7) If any undertakers or non-statutory undertakers or any

local authority think themselves aggrieved by any prescription

of the Board of Trade made under this section, they may, within

twenty-one days of the making of the prescription, notify the

Board in writing of their objection thereto and thereupon the

Board (unless they modify the prescription to the satisfaction

of the objectors) shall refer the objection to the arbitration of a

competent and impartial person to be appointed for the purpose

by the Lord Chancellor, and that person may confirm, with or

without modification, or annul the prescription, and his decision,

after considering any representations made by the objectors or

by the Board in writing and if requested by either of them to do

so, after hearing the objectors and the representatives of the

Board, shall be final and conclusive.

(8) Any decision of a person appointed by the Lord

Chancellor as aforesaid purporting to have been signed by

him shall for all purposes and to all intents be prima facie

evidence of the due making and signing thereof without proof

of such signature.

6.—(1) If any undertakers or non-statutory undertakers

think themselves aggrieved by any report of a gas examiner,

they may within twenty-one days appeal to the Board of Trade

who shall appoint a competent and impartial person to determine

the appeal, and that person may confirm with or without amendment or annul the report, and his decision, after considering any

representations made by the parties in writing, and, if requested

by any of them to do so, after hearing the parties, shall be final

and conclusive.

(2) The report of a gas examiner (including any such report

as amended on appeal as aforesaid) showing any failure to comply

with the provisions of any enactment as to the calorific value,

purity, pressure or composition of gas, shall, subject to the

provisions of subsection (4) of section nine of this Act, be

conclusive evidence of the liability of the undertakers or non-

statutory undertakers supplying the gas to a forfeiture in

respect thereof.

(3) Any decision of a person appointed by the Board of

Trade under this section purporting to have been signed by him

shall, for all purposes and to all intents, be prima facie evidence

of the due making and signing thereof without proof of such

signature.

(a) to comply with any lawful prescription of the Board of

Trade under this Act relating to them or to provide

or maintain any testing place, apparatus or materials

or any other matter or thing which they are required

to provide or maintain by this Act or any such

prescription; or

(b) to afford to the gas examiner or a person authorised in

they shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding

twenty-five pounds and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a

further fine not exceeding five pounds for each day during which

the default continues.

9. —(1) If for a period of two hours or upwards the calorific

value of gas supplied by any thermal unit undertakers, ascertained

in accordance with the provisions of this Act, is more than five

per cent, below the declared calorific value, the undertakers

shall be liable on summary conviction to a forfeiture not exceeding

five pounds for every complete one per cent, by which the

calorific value is deficient in excess of such five per cent.

(2) If, where there is no continuous record of the calorific

value of the gas supplied by any such undertakers, the calorific

value of gas so supplied is found at any testing place on any

occasion of testing to be more than five per cent, below the

declared calorific value, a second testing shall be made after an

interval of not less than one hour, and the mean of the two

testings shall be deemed for the purpose of the last foregoing

subsection to be the calorific value of the gas supplied by the

undertakers at that testing place for a period of two hours

ascertained as aforesaid.

(3) If on any occasion the gas supplied by any undertakers

or non-statutory undertakers does not conform with the provisions

as to purity or pressure contained in any enactment for the

time being in force relating to them, they shall be liable on

summary conviction—

(a) in the case of thermal unit undertakers, to a forfeiture

not exceeding ten pounds; and

(b) in the case of any other undertakers or non-statutory

undertakers, to a forfeiture not exceeding five pounds.

1934. Gas Undertakings Ch. 28.

(4) No undertakers or non-statutory undertakers shall be

liable to any forfeiture under this section in any case where they

show that the deficiency or failure was due to circumstances not

within their control, or be liable for more than one forfeiture in

respect of any day for any deficiency in pressure, composition or

purity of gas supplied from any one works cr, in the case of

thermal unit undertakers, for any deficiency in calorific value

of gas so supplied.

(5) Proceedings against any undertakers or non-statutory

undertakers in respect of any forfeiture incurred under this Act

may be commenced at any time within three months after the

date of the report of the gas examiner which is evidence of their

liability to that forfeiture:

Provided that, in the event of an appeal to the Board of

Trade against any such report, proceedings may be commenced

within three months after the determination of the appeal or, in

a case where the appeal is withdrawn, within three months after

the date of the receipt by the Board of notice of its withdrawal.

and for purposes connected with the matters

aforesaid.

[28th June 1934.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

as follows:—

Part I.

Amendment of Unemployment Insurance Acts.

Insured Persons.

1.—(1) The minimum age for entry into insurance

under the principal Act shall, instead of being the age

Act, 1934.

Part I. (2) The rates of contribution applicable under the

— coni- Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920 to 1933, in the case

of persons under the age of eighteen years shall apply only

as respects persons who are between the ages of sixteen

and eighteen years, and the contributions payable .under

the Unemployment Insurance Acts by employed persons

and their employers shall, in the case of persons who

have not attained the age of sixteen years be at the

following rates, that is to say, from the employed person

for each week twopence, and from the employer for each

week twopence.

(3) Subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of Part I of the First Schedule to this Act, the Minister shall, after consultation with the Board of

Education and the Scottish Education Department, and

with the approval of the Treasury, provide by regulations

for crediting with contributions any persons who, after

attaining the age at which the period of compulsory

elementary instruction ends, have continued to receive

whole-time education, and the provisions of Part II of

that Schedule shall have effect as to the reckoning of

contributions so credited.

Regulations made under this subsection shall not

come into force until the expiration of twelve months

after the coming into operation of this section, but as

from the date on which they come into force shall apply

to persons who, having previously (whether before or

after the commencement of this Part of this Act)

attained the age aforesaid, have continued and are then

continuing to receive whole time education.

(4) This section shall come into operation on the

third day of September, nineteen hundred and thirty-

four, or on such earlier date as the Minister may by

order direct.

Power to

enlarge or

restrict

excepted

employments.

2.—(1) Where it appears to the Minister that the

terms and conditions of service of, and the nature of the work performed by any class of persons employed

in an excepted employment are so similar to the terms

and conditions of service of, and the nature of the work

performed by, a class of persons employed in an

insurable employment as to result in anomalies in the

operation of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, the Minister may, by regulations made with the consent of

conditions as may be specified in the regulations, either— —cont.

(a) provide for including the class of persons employed

in insurable employment among the classes of

persons employed in excepted employment; or

(b) provide for including the class of persons employed

in excepted employment among the classes of

persons employed in insurable employment.

(2) Section four of the principal Act shall cease

to have effect but any order or special order made under

that section shall continue in force and have effect as

if the provisions thereof had been made by regulations.

(3) The Minister may by regulations provide, subject to

such exceptions and conditions as he thinks fit, for adding

any class of employment to the excepted employments

only as respects persons who are in any week employed

in that class of employment to such extent (being in

the opinion of the Minister inconsiderable) as may be

specified in the regulations.

Benefit.

3.—(1) An insured contributor who is between the Right to,

ages of sixteen and sixty-five years and is unemployed and dura-

shall, if he proves that the statutory conditions are tion of .

fulfilled in his case, and if he is not disqualified under the benefit *

Unemployment Insurance Acts for the receipt of benefit,

be entitled, subject to the provisions of those Acts, to

receive in a benefit year, benefit—

(a) in respect of periods not exceeding in the

aggregate one hundred and fifty-six days; and

(b) if qualified for additional days under the provisions of the next following subsection, in

respect of additional days of which the maximum

number shall be computed in manner provided

by that subsection.

(2) The following provisions shall have effect with

respect to additional days—

(a) an insured contributor shall be qualified for

additional days if at the beginning of the benefit

year five insurance years have elapsed since the

beginning of the insurance year in which he first

became such a contributor, so, however, that a

Part I.

Geo. 5. c. 30,

Ch. 29. Unemployment 24 & 25 Geo. 5.

Act, 1934.

person shall cease to be so qualified if at the

beginning of any benefit year five consecutive

insurance years have elapsed without contributions being paid in respect of him as an

insured contributor, but upon contributions

being again so paid shall be treated for the

purposes of this paragraph as if he had then

first become an insured contributor;

(b) the maximum number of additional days in any

benefit year shall be computed, in the case of

an insured contributor qualified for such days,

by allowing to him days at the rate of three for

every five contributions paid in respect of him

as an insured contributor in respect of the last

five years, less one day for every five- days in

respect of which benefit has been paid to him

in respect of the benefit years which ended in

the last five years.

For the purposes of this paragraph—

(i) the expression “the last five years ” means

the period of five complete insurance years

last preceding the beginning of the benefit

year in respect of which the computation of

additional days is made;

(ii) every two contributions paid in respect of

a person as an insured contributor under the

age of eighteen years shall be reckoned as

one contribution;

(iii) fractions of a day shall be disregarded.

(3) An insured contributor who has in any benefit

year exhausted his benefit rights shall not thereafter be

entitled to benefit in respect of any day in that benefit

year, nor shall he become entitled to benefit in his next

benefit year before the Monday next after the end of the

calendar week for which there is paid the last of the ten

contributions mentioned in paragraph (b) of the next

following section.

(4) In calculating contributions for the purposes of the last two foregoing subsections, paragraph (i) of subsection (2) of section five of the Unemployment Insurance

Act 1927 (which provides that no account shall be taken

of any contributions paid in respect of any person in respect of any period during which he was not bona fide

1934. Unemployment Ch. 29.

Act, 1934.

employed) shall apply in like manner as it applies in

calculating the thirty contributions required by the

first statutory condition.

(5) The Minister may by regulations make provision as to the circumstances in which and the

extent to which contributions paid in error and

sums paid to a person by way of benefit while he was not

entitled thereto are to be taken into account for the

purposes of this and the next following section.

(6) After an insured contributor has at the beginning

of his benefit year proved that the first statutory condition is fulfilled in his case, then, subject to and in

accordance with regulations made by the Minister, he

shall be treated throughout the remainder of that benefit

year as if that condition continued to be so fulfilled.

4. — (1) For all the purposes of the Unemployment

Insurance Acts, the expression “benefit year ” shall

mean, in relation to an insured contributor, the period of

twelve months beginning on the date on which, on

a claim for benefit, he proves for the first time after

the commencement of this Part of this Act—

(a) that the first statutory condition is fulfilled in

his case; and

(b) in the case only of an insured contributor who

has exhausted his benefit rights in his last

preceding benefit year, also that contributions

have been paid in respect of him for ten

weeks since the Sunday last before the last

day in that benefit year in respect of which

he received benefit;

and every subsequent period of twelve months commencing on the date on which that contributor on

a claim for benefit proves the matters aforesaid for

the first time after the termination of his last preceding

benefit year.

(2) If, in the case of any insured contributor, it is

found that he has been treated in error as having begun his

benefit year on any date by reason of his having been

wrongly treated as having proved any of the matters

aforesaid on that date, his benefit year shall nevertheless

be deemed to have begun on that date, but he shall not be

weekly rate of benefit in respect of dependants), shall

have effect as if for the words “eight shillings, ” wherever

“ nine shillings.”

(2) This section shall come into operation on the

passing of this Act.

“ avail himself of a reasonable opportunity of suitable

“ employment.”

(2) An insured contributor shall not be deemed to

have failed to fulfil the third statutory condition by

reason only that he is attending at an authorised course,

or at a training course or course of instruction

approved by the Minister in his case.

fifth statutory condition for the receipt of benefit by

insured contributors—

“ (v) that, if the Minister has, for the purpose

required him to attend at an authorised course, he

proves either that he duly attended in’ accordance

with the requirement, or that he had good cause

for not so attending.”

umpire shall declare the insured contributor to be disentitled to benefit for a period of six weeks or such shorter

period as may be determined by the court of referees

or the umpire, as the case may be, being a period

beginning as from such date as may be so determined.

(ii) a person who, not having normally been

engaged in any remunerative occupation since

attaining the age of sixteen years, might

reasonably have expected that his normal

occupation would have been such employment

as aforesaid but for the industrial circumstances

person is disqualified for receiving benefit under the

(3) Any question whether a person is or is not a

person to whom this Part of this Act applies shall be

decided by officers of the Board on an application made

in the prescribed manner, but any applicant for an

allowance under this Part of this Act or any public

assistance authority may appeal from any such decision

to the chairman of the appeal tribunal constituted in

accordance with the provisions of the Seventh Schedule

to this Act, whose decision shall be final:

Provided that, if, on consideration of any appeal

under this subsection, any dispute or doubt arises as to—

(a) the question whether any employment is employment in respect of which contributions are

payable under the Widows’, Orphans’ and Old

Age Contributory Pensions Acts, 1925 to 1932; or

(b) the question whether a person is disqualified

for receiving benefit under the Unemployment

Insurance Acts owing to his having lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was

due to a trade dispute, or would have been so

disqualified as aforesaid if he had been an

insured contributor under those Acts;

the first mentioned question shall be referred by the

chairman of the appeal tribunal for the decision of the Minister of Health in such manner as he may direct, and

manner as if the question had arisen upon a claim for

benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, so,

however, that an appeal from the decision of an insurance

officer or a court of referees upon any such question shall

not lie at the instance of a public assistance authority.

An appeal from a decision of the Minister of Health

upon a question referred to him under this subsection

shall lie in the same manner as an appeal under section

14 & 15 eighty-nine of the National Health Insurance Act, 1924,

Geo. 5. o. 38. and the rides of court for regulating such appeals shall

apply accordingly and the Minister of Health shall have

the same power to refer a question for decision, and the

same powers as to revising decisions, and the same right of

appearing and being heard, as he has under that section.

(4) Nothing in the last foregoing subsection shall be

construed as preventing an officer of the Board or the

chairman of the appeal tribunal, on new facts being

brought to his knowledge, revising a decision given in

any particular ease, but for the purposes of any such

revision the provisions of the last foregoing subsection

shall apply in like manner as they applied in relation

to the original decision, and the revised decision shall

have effect as from the date thereof.

37. In the exercise of the functions of the

Unemployment Assistance Board under this Part of this Act the Board, with the approval of the Minister, may—

(a) provide and maintain training courses for persons

who have attained the age of eighteen years and

make contributions in respect of the cost of the provision and maintenance of such courses

by the Minister or by any local authority or

other body; and

(b) make provision for the continuance of the

training and instruction afforded in connection

with any such training course by entering into

agreements with local authorities whereby

persons to whom this Part of this Act applies,

may, as part of such training and instruction,

be employed for periods not exceeding three

months upon work for the authority of such a

character as to render them more fit for entry

into or return to regular employment and under

conditions suitable for that purpose; but any

such agreement shall be subject to the approval

of the Treasury and shall provide for payment

at the expense of the authority of the rates of

wages customary in the district, and may

either through its own officers, or, if and so long as

applies and the application of* the proceeds of such

collection.

(2) An order made under this section with respect

to any foreign country may be made so as to apply to

due to, or for the benefit of, persons ordinarily resident or

ordinarily carrying on business in that foreign country,

or to any such debts as aforesaid.

(3) While an order made under this section is in

force with respect to any foreign country, every person

from whom any debt to which the order applies is or becomes due shall, subject to such exceptions and conditions,

thereof, shall be recoverable by the Clearing Office

accordingly, and their receipt for any sum paid to them

under this section in respect of a debt shall, so far

(4) For the purpose of facilitating the collection by

the Clearing Office of debts to which an order made under

this section applies, being debts due or to become due in

respect of goods imported into the United Kingdom, the

has been given to that office, or that the

Clearing Office claim no payment in respect of the goods; or

(b) pay to the Commissioners for the credit of the

Clearing Office a sum equal to the value of the

goods, or to such proportion of their value as

may be specified in the order;

respect of goods exceeds the debt due or to become due

in respect of those goods, the excess shall be repaid by

the Clearing Office.

subsection in respect thereof, as if that payment were a

payment in respect of a duty of customs with which the

goods were chargeable, and for the purposes of this

subsection, the value of any imported goods shall be

ascertained in the manner in which the value of imported goods is by law required to be ascertained for the

purposes of any enactment whereunder a duty of

customs is chargeable on goods by reference to their

value.

in respect of those goods, shall have the like rights

against any person by whom documents of title relating

to those goods are held as if he had made the like

payment to that person.

(6) The Clearing Office shall, after making any

necessary adjustments in respect of overpayments made

to them, apply any sums received by them by virtue of this section and of any order made thereunder

(2) Where a cause of action survives as aforesaid

for the benefit of the estate of a deceased person, the

damages recoverable for the benefit of the estate of that

person:—

(a) shall not include any exemplary damages;

(b) in the case of a breach of promise to marry shall

be limited to such damage, if any, to the estate

of that person as flows from the breach of promise

to marry;

(c) where the death of that person has been caused

by the act or omission which gives rise to the

cause of action, shall be calculated without

reference to any loss or gain to his estate consequent on his death, except that a sum in

respect of funeral expenses may be included.

(3) No proceedings shall be maintainable in respect

of a cause of action in tort which by virtue of this section

has survived against the estate of a deceased person,

unless either—

(a) proceedings against him in respect of that cause

of action were pending at the date of his death;

or

(b) the cause of action arose not earlier than six

months before his death and proceedings are

taken in respect thereof not later than six

months after his personal representative took

out representation.

(4) Where damage has been suffered by reason

of any act or omission in respect of which a cause of

action would have subsisted against any person if that

person had not died before or at the same time as the

damage was suffered, there shall be deemed, for the

purposes of this Act, to have been subsisting against

him before his death such cause of action in respect of

that act or omission as would have subsisted if he had

died after the damage was suffered.

(5) The rights conferred by this Act for the benefit

of the estates of deceased persons shall be in addition to

and not in derogation of any rights conferred on the

(6) In the event of the insolvency of an estate

against which proceedings are maintainable by virtue

of this section, any liability in respect of the cause of

action in respect of which the proceedings are maintainable shall be deemed to be a debt provable in the

demand in the nature of unliquidated damages arising

otherwise than by a contract, promise or breach of trust.

(7) Subsections (1), (2), (5) and (6) of section twenty-

six of the Administration of Estates Act, 1925, shall cease

Acts, 1846 to 1908, a person shall be deemed to be the

parent or child of the deceased person notwithstanding

that he was only related to him illegitimately or in

consequence of adoption; and accordingly in deducing

any relationship which under the provisions of those

Acts is included within the meaning of the expressions

“ parent ” and “ child, ” any illegitimate person and any

adopted person shall be treated as being, or as having

been, the legitimate offspring of his mother and reputed

father or, as the case may be, of his adopters.

matters aforesaid.

[25th July 1934.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

1.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act no

young person shall be employed about the business of a

shop for more than the normal maximum working hours,

that is to say, forty-eight working hours in any week.

(2) On occasions of seasonal or exceptional pressure

of work at any shop, young persons between the ages of

sixteen and eighteen years may, subject as hereinafter

provided, and subject to the provisions of any other

enactment, be employed about the business of the shop

was in that week or period employed about the business

of any other shop or in a factory or workshop:

Provided that, if in any proceedings against the

occupier of a shop in respect of a contravention of the

provisions of this Act it is shown that the contravention

occurred only by reason of time during which a young

person was employed by another employer being deemed,

in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, to

be time during which he was employed about the business

of that shop, it shall be a defence to prove that the

occupier did not know and could not with reasonable

day in a factory or workshop shall be employed on that

of this section, the occupier of the shop shall be

is necessary to make provision for preventing the hours

of employment of young persons from being so divided into

spells as to deprive them of reasonable opportunities for

instruction and recreation, he may make regulations

directing that, subject to such exceptions and modifications as may be provided by the regulations, the working

otherwise; and

(b) of time allowed for attendance at such instructional courses,

as may be specified in the regulations.

(2) Any regulations made under this section shall

be laid before Parliament as soon as may be after they

are made, and if either House of Parliament within the

next subsequent twenty-eight days on which that House

has sat after any such regulation has been laid before

it resolves that the regulation shall be annulled, the

regulation shall forthwith be void, but without prejudice

to the validity of anything previously done thereunder or

to the making of a new regulation.

as follows:—

1.—(1) The third of the conditions prescribed by

the order of the Treasury dated the sixth day of December,

nineteen hundred, and made under section two of the

Colonial Stock Act, 1900 (which provides that certain

stocks with respect to which prescribed conditions have

been observed shall be trustee securities), shall be deemed

to have been observed with respect to any stock issued

by the Government of a Dominion if either the requirement

in regard to the stock, shall not be submitted

for the Royal Assent except after agreement

with His Majesty’s Government in the United

Kingdom, and that if attention is drawn to any

such legislation as aforesaid after the passing

thereof by the Parliament of the Dominion, His

Majesty’s Government in the Dominion will

take the necessary steps to ensure such amendment as may be requested by His Majesty’s

Government in the United Kingdom; and

(b) that undertaking has been confirmed by an Act

of the Parliament of the Dominion.

(2) In this Act the expression “Dominion ” has the

same meaning as in the Statute of Westminster, 1931. 22 & 23

(2) The sums so issued shall be issued during a

period ending on the day on which a further Act granting

money for the purposes of those loans comes into operation and in accordance with the provisions of the National

Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887.

2. Whereas it is expedient that the principal of the several local loans specified in the tables contained

in Part I and Part II of the Schedule to this Act should,

to the extent specified in the last column of those tables,

not be reckoned as assets of the local loans fund established under the National Debt and Local Loans Act,

1887:

Now, therefore, the principal of the said loans to the

extent aforesaid shall be written off from the assets of the local loans fund, and the provisions of section fifteen

of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

3. Whereas in pursuance of an agreement made in

the year eighteen hundred and ninety-two the sum of

ten thousand pounds was advanced by the Public Works

Loan Commissioners to the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees

on the security of the harbour revenues with the collateral

security of the Fishery Board for Scotland:

And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by

section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the

liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect

of the said loan was extinguished without prejudice to

the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay

the said loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said

collateral security is the sole security for the repayment

of the said loan:

And whereas the terms of the said collateral security

are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between

the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan

Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March, eighteen

hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the

surplus herring brand fees as defined in clause three of the said memorandum was pledged in security for the

repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the security given

by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan,

and it was provided that the said portion of the surplus

herring brand fees of any one year should only be

Act, 1934.

Ch. 48.

417

applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of

principal and interest on outstanding principal falling

due under the security for the said loan in the same

year, and should not be applicable to the repayment of

arrears of principal:

And whereas the said portion of the surplus herring

brand fees so pledged as aforesaid was during the year

ending the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred

and thirty-three, and the year ending the thirty-first

day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-four, insufficient to discharge in full the instalments of principal

with interest which fell due under the security for the

said loan in those years, and the principal sum of four

hundred pounds with interest amounting to one hundred

and twenty-seven pounds four s hillin gs, now remains

unpaid, and under the terms of the said memorandum

of agreement is irrecoverable:

Now, therefore, the said principal sum of four

hundred pounds shall be extinguished, and the said

arrears of interest amounting to one hundred and twenty-

seven pounds four shillings shall be remitted.

are in addition to, and not in substitution for, the powers

conferred on a local authority by section sixty-eight of the Public Health Act, 1925 (which relates to the provision of parking places and confers amongst other powers

a power to make regulations as to certain charges).

(2) A local authority shall have power to make

charges for the use of a parking place, not being part

of a street, as a station for public service vehicles.

The charges to be made under this subsection as

respects any vehicles shall be such reasonable charges

as may be fixed by the local authority, so however,

that if the public service vehicle licence holder in respect

of any vehicles using the parking place as a station

considers that the charges fixed are unreasonable, then,

in default of agreement between the licence holder and

the local authority for a reduction thereof, the charges

in respect of those vehicles shall be such as may be

determined by the Minister.

service vehicles, and a person shall not employ any

person, who is not so licensed, to drive a heavy goods

vehicle on a road, and if any person acts in contravention

of this section he shall be guilty of an offence.

who satisfies the licensing authority that in the course of the year ending on the first day of April, nineteen

hundred and thirty-four, he has been, during any period

or periods of, or amounting in the aggregate to, six

months, in the habit of driving a heavy goods vehicle,

authority shall grant the licence, and the provisions of the last foregoing subsection shall not apply in relation

to such an application.

(7) A licence shall, unless previously revoked, continue in force for three years from the date on which it is

expressed to take effect, but may at any time be suspended

or revoked by the licensing authority of the area in

which it was granted upon the ground that, by reason of

his conduct as a driver of a motor vehicle or of physical

disability, the holder is not a fit person to hold such a

imposed thereon, may by notice in writing to the

licensing authority require him to reconsider the matter,

and shall on a reconsideration be entitled to be heard

either personally or by his representative.

Any person who is so aggrieved as aforesaid, or who

is dis-satisfied with the decision of the licensing authority

on reconsideration of the matter, may appeal to a court

of summary jurisdiction acting for the petty sessional

division in which the applicant resides, and on any such

appeal the court may make such order as it thinks fit

and any order so made shall be binding on the licensing

authority.

which the scheme applies, purports to confer on the board

any right to recover from the purchaser the whole or

any part of any damages for which the purchaser may

be liable under the contract in respect of a breach of

warranty on his part, then, without prejudice to the

traffic passing in one direction, and that any other road, being a

trunk road or a road which is to become a trunk road by virtue

of the order, should be used only for traffic passing in the other

direction, then, without prejudice to the power of the Minister to

make orders under section forty-six of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, 20 Geo. 5.

the order under the said section one may make provision forc* 43-

restricting the use of those roads accordingly as from such date

Provided that in the application of the Act of 1935 to any such track or path as aforesaid, section one of that Act (which relates to the adoption of standard widths) shall not apply, and subsection (1) of section two of that Act (which relates to the restriction of development along the frontages of roads) shall have effect as if for the reference in paragraph (6) thereof to land within two hundred and twenty feet from the middle of the road there were substituted a reference to land forming the site of the track or path. 3

(3) For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that in calculating for the purposes of the Act of 1935 the middle of any trunk road in connection with which a cycle track or footpath is constructed, so much of the track or path as is separated from the road by any land not forming part of that road is to be disregarded.

2. —(1) Section four of the Superannuation Act, 1914, and section eight of the Superannuation Act, 1935 (which provide for superannuation benefits for a civil servant who with the consent of the head of his Department is transferred from the civil service to approved employment) shall subject to the adaptations set out in the next following sub-paragraph apply to a civil servant who, after being transferred as aforesaid, is with the consent of the Treasury transferred to one or more subsequent employments recognised by the Treasury as being employments to which it is expedient that the provisions of the said section four should apply.

(2) The said adaptations are as follows:—

(2) The Treasury may make regulations for securing that where,

in any case to which the regulations apply, it appears to the Treasury that the provisions of the said section three, either as originally enacted or as extended by sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, would have been applicable in the case of any person but for the fact that he was refused appointment as a civil servant on the ground that by reason of his age he would not if appointed a civil servant have become eligible to receive a superannuation allowance on retirement at the retiring age, the said person may be treated as having been eligible for such superannuation benefits as appear to the Treasury to be equitable having regard to the benefits for which he would have j been eligible if he had been appointed a civil servant at the time when he was refused such appointment. 1

(3) Payments by way of superannuation allowance shall not be j made by virtue of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph in respect of any period before the first day of April, nineteen hundred and forty-six; but save as aforesaid, and subject to the provisions of regulations of the Treasury under this paragraph, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall apply in the case of persons retiring or dying as well before as after the commencement of this Act and any payment under the Superannuation Acts made before the commencement of this Act shall be adjusted accordingly.

(4) Regulations of the Treasury under this paragraph may provide for determining the persons to whom, and the cases in which, payments shall be made by virtue of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph where the person to whom they would otherwise be payable has died or cannot be found, and for dispensing with the production of probate or other proof of the title of the person to whom payment is to be made.

4. Subsection (2) of section three of the Superannuation Act, 1935, shall have effect, and shall be deemed always to have had effect, as if for paragraph (c) thereof there were substituted the following paragraph—

(iii) a person whose normal occupation is employment in respect of which, by virtue of section four of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940, contributions would but for the National Insurance Act, 1946, have been payable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1935 to 1940; and

9 & 10 Geo. 6.

and comprises an area suitable to be dealt with as a unit for the purpose of rehabilitation thereof for such purposes, and that the improvements proposed are comprehensive enough to provide adequately for the rehabilitation of the land for such purposes; and (6) that the cost of the work required for making any of the improvements proposed will not be unreasonably high in relation to the benefit to be derived therefrom; and before varying an approved scheme under any of the provisions of this Act in that behalf he shall satisfy himself that the scheme as varied will be in conformity with those requirements.

(3) In this Act—

the expression " hill farming land" means mountain, hill and heath land which is suitable for use for the maintenance of sheep of a hardy kind but not of sheep of other kinds, or which by improvement could be made so suitable; the expression " hill farming purposes" means the maintenance of sheep of a hardy kind and the keeping and management thereof in accordance with the recognised practices of hill sheep farming, and includes other activities carried on in connection therewith; and the expression " improvement " means, subject to the provisions of this section, an operation of any of the kinds specified in the First Schedule to this Act, and any operation incidental to, or necessary or proper in the carrying out of, an operation of any such kind or for securing the full benefit thereof.

(4) Subject to the provisions of section thirty-seven of this Act, the Ministers may from time to time by order modify the kinds of operations that are to be treated as improvements for the purposes of this Act by adding to the First Schedule to this Act, or by deleting therefrom, or modifying the description of, a kind of operation for the time being therein specified :

Provided that, for the purposes of this Act in its application to a scheme approved before the coming into force of an order under this subsection, any operation which would have been treated as an improvement apart from the order shall continue to be so treated, except that no provision for the carrying out of an operation which by virtue of the order is not to be treated as an improvement shall be made by any subsequent variation of the scheme.

(5) In considering the approval or variation of hill fanning land improvement schemes the appropriate Minister shall have regard to any other provisions in force which may authorise the giving of assistance out of public moneys, by way of grant, subsidy or otherwise, in respect of improvements of the kind proposed and the giving of assistance under any such other

(2) Subject to any provision to the contrary made by the approved scheme, an improvement grant payable in respect of the cost of any work shall be paid to the person responsible under the scheme for doing that work.

(3) An improvement grant in respect of the cost of any work may be paid on the completion of the work, or by instalments on the completion of parts thereof.

(4) The aggregate of the amounts of improvement grants paid shall not exceed a maximum of four million pounds :

Provided that provision for increasing the said maximum by not more than one million pounds may be made by an order made by the Ministers with the consent of the Treasury at any time within five years from the commencement of this Act and approved by a resolution of the Commons House of Parliaments

3. —(1) A hill farming land improvement scheme shall describe Contents,

(2) Such a scheme may be submitted by any person having an interest in the land for the benefit of which improvements are thereby proposed, or by any person desiring to acquire £uch an interest as aforesaid in the event of the scheme's being approved, or by two or more such persons, and the appropriate Minister may approve such a scheme submitted as aforesaid either with or without modifications.

(3) References in this Act to work done in accordance with an approved hill farming land improvement scheme shall be construed, as respects work done at any time, as references to work described in such a scheme (as it stands at that time, whether as approved or as varied under any of the provisions of this Act in that behalf) and done on the land therein described as the land on which the work is to be done by the person therein specified as the person responsible for doing the work.

(4) Every person who has an interest in land on which, in accordance with such a scheme as approved or as varied as aforesaid, any work is to be done, and who has joined in submitting

the scheme or consented to the approval thereof, or has consented to the variation thereof, as the case may be, and every person deriving title to any interest in that land through or under or in succession to any such person, shall be under obligation to permit the doing on the land of all things reasonably necessary to be done thereon for the doing of the work and the maintenance of the improvement.

(5) Before approving or varying such a scheme the appropriate Minister shall satisfy himself that the person or persons who will be responsible under the scheme as approved, or as varied as aforesaid, as the case may be, for doing the work described therein is or are willing that the work for which he or they respectively will be so responsible should be done -by him or by them respectively, and that he or they will be in a position to do it having regard to the provisions of the last preceding subsection and to the nature of the interest or interests in the land of the persons who have joined or consented as aforesaid.

(6) The person specified in such a scheme as the person responsible for doing any work may make arrangements with the appropriate Minister or the appropriate local committee constituted under this Act for the doing of the work by the said Minister or committee instead of that person, but at his expense and so that for the purposes of improvement grant the work shall be treated as having been done by that person.

' 4. A hill farming land improvement scheme may be revoked or varied at any time by the appropriate Minister—

(a) on application in that behalf being made to him by the

person or persons who under the scheme, as it stands immediately before the revocation or variation, is or are responsible for doing the work described therein; or

(b) in the absence of such application if that person, or

each of those persons, consents.

5.—(1) If after a hill farming land improvement scheme has been approved it appears to the appropriate Minister to be necessary so to do on the ground either—

(a) that it is in the public interest that land for the benefit

of which an improvement thereby provided for is to be carried out should be used otherwise than for hill farming purposes, or that land on which work therein described is to be done should be used for a purpose inconsistent with the doing of that work thereon; or

(b) that for any other reason the public interest so requires; he may revoke the scheme, or may vary the scheme as appears to him to be requisite on that ground.

(2) Before revoking or varying a scheme under this section the appropriate Minister shall consult the appropriate advisory committee constituted under this Act.

I946- Hill Fanning Cr. 73. 1061

Act, 1946.

(3) Where an approved hill farming land improvement scheme is revoked or varied under this section and cost of work done in accordance with the scheme is rendered abortive by the revocation or variation thereof, the appropriate Minister may pay out of moneys provided by Parliament to the person by whom that cost was incurred an amount equal to that cost in so far as it is so rendered abortive, less the amount of any improvement grant paid or payable in respect of that cost.

For the purposes of this subsection, cost of work done as aforesaid shall be treated as rendered abortive by the revocation or variation of the scheme if and in so far as that cost exceeds the amount of any increase attributable to the work in the value of any interest belonging to the person by whom that cost was incurred in any land, and the amount of any such increase shall be determined by agreement between the appropriate Minister and that person, or, in default of agreement, shall be determined by an official arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Acquisition of Land 9 & 10 Geo. 5. (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, who shall have thec- 57-like powers with respect to procedure, costs, and the statement of special cases as he has under that Act.

6. Where in the opinion of the appropriate Minister any Revocation or work described in an approved hill farming land improvement variation of scheme has been badly done, or has been or is being unreasonably g^eg10^ delayed, or is unlikely to be completed (otherwise than in conse- g,.oun(i Qf quence of a revocation or variation of the scheme under either of bad work, the two last preceding sections)— delay, etc.

(a) if it appears to him that in consequence thereof the improvements, so far as they are likely to be carried out, will not provide adequately for the rehabilitation of the land, or that the cost of the work described in the scheme so far as remaining to be done will be unreasonably high in relation to the benefit to be derived therefrom, he may revoke the scheme;

(b) if it appears to him that the position would be as mentioned in the preceding paragraph in the absence of a variation of the scheme, but can be rectified by specifying a different person as the person responsible for doing any work or by further or other variation of the scheme, he may vary the scheme accordingly;

(c) whether he acts under either of the preceding paragraphs

or not, he may recover any payment made as an improvement grant or part of an improvement grant in respect of the cost of the work badly done or delayed or unlikely to be completed, and may recover any -payment so made in respect of the cost of other work

done in accordance with the approved scheme if it appears to him that in the circumstances that work will not contribute to providing adequately for the rehabilitation of the land or that the cost thereof is excessive in relation to the benefit that will be derived therefrom.

7. Before revoking or varying a hill fanning land improvement scheme the appropriate Minister shall afford to—

(a) the person or persons who under the scheme as it stands immediately before the revocation or variation, is or are responsible for doing the work described therein;

(b) any person having an interest in the land for the benefit

of which improvements are thereby proposed or in other land specified in the scheme as land on which work is to be done; and

(c) any other person who satisfies the appropriate Minister that representations by him ought to be taken into consideration;

an opportunity of appearing before and being heard by a person appointed for the purpose by the appropriate Minister, and shall consider the report of that person.

8.—(1) The fact that a person to whom an improvement grant in respect of the cost of any work is payable, or would otherwise be payable or has been paid, has in the opinion of the appropriate Minister, neglected, during the period whilst the work was being done, to do other work for the benefit of the land for the benefit of which the improvement was intended, or of contiguous or adjacent land, being work which he ought to have done in the ordinary course in accordance with the rules of good husbandry or with practice customary in the course of good estate management, shall be a ground on which the appropriate Minister may reduce or withhold the grant, or, if it has been paid, may recover from that person the grant or such part of it as appears to the appropriate Minister to be proper.

(2) The appropriate Minister may, as a condition of approving a hill farming land improvement scheme, require the making, by a person approved by him, of a record of the condition of land for the benefit of which improvements are thereby proposed containing particulars as respects such matters as ought in his opinion to be recorded in connection with the scheme, and the cost incurred in the making of such a record shall be deemed to be part of the cost of work done in accordance with an approved hill farming land improvement scheme for the purpose of subsection (1) of section one of this Act.

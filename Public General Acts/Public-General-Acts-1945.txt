(b) that there is no reason to believe that that machinery is likely to cease to exist or be adequate for that purpose,

the commission shall report to the Minister accordingly and may include in its report any suggestions which it may think fit to make as to the improvement of that machinery.

(3) Where any such suggestions are so included, the Minister shall take such steps as appear to him to be expedient and practicable to secure the improvements in question.

Provided that, in relation to a chargeable accounting period which is less than twelve months, references in this subsection to twelve thousand pounds shall be construed as references to a sum which bears the same proportion to twelve thousand pounds as the length of the period bears to twelve months.

(2) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to any member of a group of companies other than the principal company, and, in the case of the principal company of a group of companies, any increase in standard profits under that subsection shall be computed as if for the references therein to the standard profits of the trade or business there were substituted references to the said standard profits (computed as therein mentioned) plus—

the trades or businesses of all subsidiary members of the group for chargeable accounting periods coterminous with, or falling wholly within, the chargeable accounting period of the trade or business of the principal company; and

or business of a subsidiary member of the group falls partly within the chargeable accounting period of the trade or business of the principal company, so much of the standard profits (so computed as aforesaid) of the trade or business of that subsidiary member for the said chargeable accounting period thereof as is apportionable to the part of that period which falls within the chargeable accounting period of the trade or business of the principal company.

Any apportionment required to be made by paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be made by comparing the number of months or fractions of months in the chargeable accounting period of the trade or business of the subsidiary member with the number of months or fractions of months in the part of that chargeable accounting period which falls within the chargeable accounting period of the trade or business of the principal company.

(4) The following provisions shall have effect in relation to chargeable accounting periods falling partly before and partly after the end of March, nineteen hundred and forty-five—

(a) the standard profits for the whole period shall be computed, first on the basis that the preceding provisions of this section do not apply to such periods as aforesaid and secondly as if the said preceding provisions applied to such periods as aforesaid as they apply to periods beginning at or after the said end of March, and it shall then be ascertained, on each basis, whether there are excess profits or a deficiency of profits for the whole period, and if so what is the amount thereof;

(b) there shall be deemed to be for the first part of the period, excess profits or a deficiency of profits, as the case may be, equal to an apportioned part of the excess profits or deficiency of profits ascertained under paragraph (a) of this subsection on the first basis mentioned therein, and there shall be deemed to be, for the second part of the period, excess profits or a deficiency of profits, as the case may be, equal to an apportioned part of the excess profits or deficiency of profits ascertained under paragraph (a) of this subsection on the second basis mentioned therein;

(c) for the purposes of this section, the first part of the whole period and the second part of the whole period shall each be treated as if it were a separate chargeable accounting period.

(3) Any such authorisation shall be for a period of not longer than ten years to be specified in the order, and shall be revocable during that period by order of the Minister.

2 & 3 Geo. 6. c. 119.

1.—(1) Where an Order in Council has been made under section two of the Chartered and Other Bodies (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1939, postponing elections of new members or officers of any corporation or body of persons, and it appears to His Majesty that—

(a) elections ought to be held without further postponement;

(b) if elections were so held, a substantial proportion of the persons who would, but for abnormal conditions arising out of the war, be qualified under the special Act as electors or candidates for election, or as electors or candidates of a particular class, would not. be so qualified; and

(c) for that reason the holding of elections in accordance with the special Act at the end of the period of postponement would be impracticable or unsatisfactory :

His Majesty may by Order in Council make such modifications in the provisions of the special Act, including in particular provisions relating to the qualifications of electors or candidates for election, as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of enabling satisfactory elections, having regard to the abnormal conditions, to be held at the end of the said period, and any such Order in Council may contain such incidental and consequential provisions as appear to His Majesty to be necessary or expedient.

(2) An Order in Council made under the foregoing subsection shall, subject as hereinafter provided, only apply to the elections held at the end of the period of postponement as aforesaid, and to any election held for the purpose of filling a casual vacancy occurring between the said elections and the next elections held otherwise than for the said purpose :

Provided that if it appears to His Majesty that owing to the continuance of the abnormal conditions it is necessary or expedient to extend the operation of any Order in Council made under the foregoing subsection, he may from time to time by Order in Council provide that the said Order shall apply, with any necessary variations, to such further elections as he may specify.

(3) Where an Order in Council made under this section provides for the holding of elections in a year in which elections would not normally be held under the special Act, the Order in Council may provide that persons elected at those elections shall hold office for a period ending on the appropriate date in the next year in which elections would normally be held under the special Act.

2. —(1) It is hereby declared for the removal of doubt that an Order in Council made under section two of the Chartered and Other Bodies (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1939, postponing elections of new members or officers of any corporation or body of persons, may—

(a) provide for the holding of such elections at the end of

the period of postponement, notwithstanding that they will be held in a year in which such elections would not normally be held under the special Act;

(b) provide that the persons elected at those elections shall

* hold office for a period ending on the appropriate date

in the next year in which elections would normally be held under the special Act; and

(c) may make such consequential modifications of the special Act as appear to His Majesty to be necessary or expedient.

Any Order in Council providing for the matter specified in paragraph -(6) of this subsection shall remain in force until the end of the period specified in that paragraph, notwithstanding the previous expiry of the Chartered and Other Bodies (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1939.

(2) It is hereby declared for the removal of doubt that, where any corporation or body of persons entitled to apply under the said section two for an Order in Council postponing elections of new members or officers of that corporation or body have failed to apply before the date when those elections were required to be held, a subsequent application for such an Order having retrospective effect may be made by or on behalf of the persons who were members of the said corporation or body immediately before the said date, and such an application shall be deemed, for the purposes of the said section two, to be a valid application made on behalf of the said corporation or body.

3. Where an Order m Council has been made under section two of the Chartered and Other Bodies (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1939, postponing elections of new members or officers of any corporation or body of persons, and elections of such members or officers have been held at the end of the period of postponement and before the passing of this Act, and it appears to His Majesty that—

(a) owing to abnormal conditions arising out of the war the

elections were not held in all respects in accordance with the provisions of the special Act; and

(b) that nevertheless the corporation or body ought in all the

circumstances of the case to be treated as validly constituted;

he may by Order in Council declare that corporation or body to be, and to have been, validly constituted as from the date when

In reckoning any such period of forty days as aforesaid, no account shall be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which both Houses are adjourned for more than four days.

(a) where rebate has been allowed under this subsection on the removal of oils to a refinery and those oils are converted in the refinery into light oils, an amount equal to the rebate allowed on so much of those oils as appears to the Commissioners to have been so converted shall be charged on the delivery of the light oils from the refinery for home consumption; and

(b) where any oils are shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners to have been removed from a refinery with respect to which a requirement under this subsection is in force to a refinery with respect to which no such requirement is in force, any customs duty charged on removal to the first mentioned refinery, less any rebate allowed, sfiaU be repaid.

(b) for producing gas for use in generating heat, light or

power for consumption outside the refinery,

Provided that—

(1) oils shall not be deemed for the purposes of this sub-

section to have been used by reason only that they have been subjected to a process of purification or blending, or to a process resulting in the conversion thereof into other oils or solid or semi-solid residues, or have been wasted in the course of any such process; and

(ii) where oils are used in a refinery in any process which permits the whole or part of the oils to be recovered in a useable state, only the part, if any, of the oils

(iii) where oils are so used in a refinery that an amount falls to be paid to the occupier of the refinery under this subsection, the amount to be paid shall be computed as if the amount of oils so used included any wastage of the oils occurring in the refinery which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, is properly attributable to the oils so used; and

(iv) in computing the amount payable under this subsection rebate shall be deemed to be allowable in respect of all oils other than such oils as satisfy both of the first two requirements specified in the definition of “ light oils " in subsection (3) of section two of the Finance Act, 1928, that is to say the requirement as to distillation at a temperature not exceeding one hundred and eighty-five degrees centigrade and the requirement as to distillation at a temperature not exceeding two hundred and forty degrees centigrade.

(4) The provisions of the Seventh Schedule to this Act shall have effect where arrangements which have effect by virtue of this section provide that tax payable under the laws of the territory concerned shall be allowed as a credit against tax payable in the United Kingdom.

(5) Where, under any arrangements which have effect by virtue of this section, relief may be given either in the United Kingdom or in the territory with the Government of which the arrangements are made in respect of any income, and it appears that the assessment to income tax made in respect of the income is not made in respect of the full amount thereof or is incorrect having regard to the credit, if any, which falls to be given under the arrangements, any such additional assessments may be made as are necessary to ensure that the total amount of the income is assessed and the proper credit, if any, is given in respect thereof, and where the income is entrusted to any person in the United Kingdom for payment any such additional assessment may be made on the recipient of the income under Case VI of Schedule D.

section applies, and the amount of tax which is authorised by Rule 20 of the General Rules to be deducted from any such dividend shall be determined without taking into account any reduction, by reason of double taxation relief, of the United Kingdom income tax payable directly or by deduction by the company, but—

(a) notwithstanding anything in the Income Tax Acts, no relief or repayment in respect of the tax deducted or authorised to be deducted from any such dividend shall be allowed at a rate exceeding die rate (hereinafter referred to as " the net United Kingdom rate ”) of the United Kingdom income tax payable directly or by deduction by the company after taking double taxation relief into account; and

(b) where the United Kingdom income tax payable directly or by deduction by the company is affected by double taxation relief, die particulars to be given by the company in the statement required by section thirty-three of the Finance Act, 1924, shall (in addition to the particulars required to be given apart from this section) include particulars of the net United Kingdom rate.

(3) Where a dividend to which this section does not apply has been paid, whether before or after the passing of this Act, and any double taxation relief would have fallen to be taken into account in relation to that dividend if this section had applied thereto, that relief shall, unless it is relief which has been taken into account for the purposes of subsection (5) of the said section twenty-seven, be taken into account as far as possible in determining the net United Kingdom rate in relation to the first dividend payable by the company to which this section applies and any part of mat relief which cannot be so taken into account shall as far as possible be taken into account in relation to the next succeeding dividend, and so on. 4

(4) Where the whole or any part of any annual payment is payable out of a dividend to which this section applies, and the rate of relief or repayment allowable in respect of the tax deducted or authorised to be deducted from the dividend is affected by double taxation relief, the annual payment, or that part thereof, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be paid out of profits or gains not brought into charge to tax and Rule 21 of the General Rules shall apply accordingly, but the tax chargeable under the said Rule on the person making the payment shall be reduced by an amount equal to tax on the payment or part of the payment at the net United Kingdom rate applicable to the dividend.

could be made; or

(b) that account is required to be taken of allowances previously

be written off the expenditure incurred on the asset for the purpose of determining whether any and if so what allowance may be given by reason of the event; or

(d) that account is required to be taken of any sum falling to be

taken into account as sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys,

the like consequences shall ensue under this Schedule as if an allowance had fallen to be made by reason of that event.

(3) Where any damage is attributable to a permanent change in the purposes for which an asset is used, or the temporary or permanent putting out of use of an asset, the question whether the damage is damage in respect of which relief may be given under the Income Tax Acts shall be determined as if the damage had been attributable to a sale of the asset on the date upon which the change or putting out of use took place.

(c) each of those amounts shall then be apportioned among the

partners by reference to their respective shares in the profits of the trade or business for the period in question;

(e) any reference in the provisions of Part IV of this Act relating

to income tax to the amount of refund referable to any of the relevant chargeable accounting periods shall be construed, in relation to each of the separate refunds, as a reference to the amount apportioned under sub-paragraph (c) of this paragraph to the partner in question in the case of that period:

Provided that where, in the case of a payment of, or on account of, a post-war refund, all the partners who were carrying on the original trade or business in the relevant chargeable accounting periods are still engaged in carrying it on when the payment falls to be made and are still then carrying it on alone and not in partnership with any other person, one joint payment may be made for all the partners, but the provisions of Part IV of this Act relating to income tax shall nevertheless have effect as though separate payments had been made as aforesaid in the case of each partner.

Part II.

6th Sch. references in this Part of this Schedule, in relation to a member of a —cont. group of companies, to relevant chargeable accounting periods shall

be construed as not including references to any chargeable accounting period during which it was not a member of the group.

3. All sums paid or payable by way of excess profits tax or the national defence contribution for any relevant chargeable accounting period in respect of any trade or business carried on by any member of a group of companies shall, for the purpose of ascertaining whether any, and if so what, post-war refund is due to any person, be deemed to have been paid or to be payable by the principal company of the group and not by any other member thereof; and for the purposes of Part IV of this Act, the trade or business of the principal company shall be deemed to be the original trade or business.

4. Where any sum is paid to the principal company for, or on account of, a post-war refund, the undertakings and authorities required by Part IV of this Act in relation to the payment shall not require the approval of the advisory panel by reason of the fact that the trade or business specified in those undertakings and authorities is not the original trade or business if the trade or business so specified is being or is to be carried on by a subsidiary member of the group.

5. Where it is finally determined that any post-war refund is payable in respect of all or any of the trades or businesses carried on by members of a group of companies during any relevant chargeable accounting period, there shall be ascertained, in the case of each subsidiary member of the group—

. (a) the total amount of excess profits tax and the national defence contribution for the relevant chargeable accounting periods which has been borne directly or indirectly by the subsidiary member;

(b) the total amount of the national defence contribution paid for the relevant chargeable accounting periods in respect of the trade or business of the subsidiary member;

(c) the total sum which could, under sub-paragraph (2) of para-

graph 8 of Part IV of the Fifth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1940, have been required to be paid on account of excess profits tax for the relevant chargeable accounting periods by the subsidiary member on the assumption that excess profits tax had been chargeable for all those periods at eighty per cent., less the amount which would, on that assumption, have been payable to the subsidiary member under sub-paragraph (3) of the said paragraph 8,

and, if the amount mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph exceeds the sum of the amounts mentioned in sub-paragraphs (6) and

(c) thereof, an amount equal to the difference shall be paid by the principal company to the subsidiary member :

Provided that—

(i) if the total of the amounts so payable by the principal company

to the subsidiary members of the group of companies exceeds the total amount paid in respect of the post-war refund, the sums so payable shall be proportionately reduced so as together to amount to the said total amount so paid; and

(ii) on the payment of any sum payable by the principal company to a subsidiary member under this paragraph, the

1945-

Finance (No. 2) Act, 1945.

Ch. 13.

823

principal company shall be entitled to deduct and retain out 6th Sch. of the payment tax at the standard rate for the year 1946-47 —coni-

as if that payment were an annual payment to which Rule 19 of the General Rules applied paid in that year out of profits and gains brought into charge to tax.

6. Where an amount is paid to a subsidiary member under the last preceding paragraph, so much of the provisions of Part IV of this Act relating to income tax as confers a right of election that a post-war refund shall be charged to income tax for the year 1947-48 shall have effect as if the said payment were a payment of refund to the subsidiary member which was to be used for the purposes of its trade or business, as if the tax deducted therefrom under Rule 19 of the General Rules as applied by the last preceding paragraph had been deducted therefrom under the provisions of Part IV of this Act relating to the deduction of tax from payments of refund, and as if the gross amount of the refund paid to the principal company were diminished by the gross amount of the said payment.

7. So much of the provisions of Part IV of this Act relating to income tax on sums paid as or on account of post-war refunds as provides that the right to elect that sums so paid shall be chargeable as profits and gains of a trade for the year 1947-48 in lieu of being chargeable to tax for the year 1946-47 shall be restricted to Cases where the person to whom the sum is paid is carrying on the trade during the whole or some part of the year 1947-48 shall not apply where, during the whole or part of the year 1947-48, the trade is being carried on by a subsidiary member of a group of companies of which the person to whom the sum was paid is then the principal company.

Part III.

Tax Paid under Finance Act, 1943, s. 24.

8. Where, under section twenty-four of the Finance Act, 1943, a joint and several liability is imposed on any persons, the rights of those persons respectively to a post-war refund shall be based on the amounts of tax ultimately bomfe by them respectively by reason of the imposition of the liability and not on the amounts of tax paid by them respectively to the Crown, and no sum shall be paid as or on account of a post-war refund in the case of any of those persons unless the Commissioners are satisfied as to the amounts so borne by all those persons and are further satisfied that any liability of any of those persons to make a payment to any other of those persons which arises by virtue of subsection (3) of the said section twenty-four has been extinguished. 9

9. Any reference in Part IV of this Act to the original trade or business shall, in relation to any post-war refund made in respect of tax paid under the said section twenty-four, be construed as a reference to the trade or business carried on by the company whose stock in trade was disposed of at the time of the disposal thereof, and any reference in section thirty-nine of this Act to the person who carried on the original trade or business shall, in relation to any post-war refund in respect of tax paid under the said section twenty-four, be deemed to include a reference to the person who bore that tax.

Limits on total credit—income tax.

4. —(1) The amount of the credit to be allowed for foreign income tax in respect of any income shall not exceed the sum which would be produced by computing the amount of that income in accordance with the Income Tax Acts, and then charging it to income tax for the year of assessment for which the credit is to be allowed, but at the following rate, that is to say—

to income tax at a rate or rates in excess of the standard rate, the sum of the following rates—

(i) the rate which would have been the appropriate rate in his case if his income had been chargeable at the standard rate only; and

7th Sch. shall have effect as respects the computation, for the purposes of the —cont‘ United Kingdom taxes, of the amount of that income.

(2) Where the income tax payable depends on the amount received in the United Kingdom, the said amount shall be deemed to be increased by the amount of the credit.

(3) Where the last preceding sub-paragraph does not apply—

(a) no deduction shall be made in respect of foreign income tax (whether in respect of the same or any other income); and

(b) where the income includes a dividend and under the

arrangements foreign income tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend is to be taken into account in considering whether any, and if so what, credit is to be given against income tax in respect of the dividend, the amount of the income shall be increased by the amount of the foreign income tax not so chargeable which falls to be taken into account in computing the amount of the credit; but

(c) notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions of this sub-paragraph, where the amount of the credit is reduced by the operation of paragraph 4 of this Schedule, the amount of the income shall be reduced by the same amount.

(4) In relation to the computation of the total income of a person for the purpose of determining the rate mentioned in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall have effect subject to the following modifications—

(a) for the reference in sub-paragraph (2) to the amount of the credit there shall be substituted a reference to the amount of the foreign income tax in respect of the income (in the case of a dividend, foreign income tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend being left out of account); and

(b) paragraphs (6) and (c) of sub-paragraph (3) shall not apply,

and subject to those modifications, shall have effect in relation to all income in the case of which credit falls to be given for foreign income tax under any arrangements for the time being in force by virtue of Part V of this Act.

Where credit for foreign excess profits tax falls to be given against excess profits tax in respect of any profits, no deduction for foreign excess profits tax (whether in respect of the same or any other profits) shall be made in computing the amount of the profits for the purposes of excess profits tax :

Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to so much of any foreign excess profits tax as is, by virtue of paragraph 6 of this Schedule, not to be allowed as a credit.

Special provisions as to dividends.

9. Where, in the case of any dividend, foreign income tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend

*945-

827

is, under the arrangements, to be taken into account in considering whether any, and if so what, credit is to be given against income tax in respect of the dividend, the foreign income tax not so chargeable which is to be taken into account shall be that borne by the body corporate paying the dividend upon the relevant profits insofar as it is properly attributable to the proportion of the relevant profits which is represented by the dividend.

The relevant profits are—

(a) if the dividend is paid for a specified period, the profits of that period;

(b) if the dividend is not paid for a specified period but is paid

out of specified profits, those profits;

(c) if the dividend is paid neither for a specified period nor out of specified profits, the profits of the last period for which accounts of the body corporate were made up which ended before the dividend became payable:

Provided that if, in a case falling under sub-paragraph (a) or sub-paragraph (c) of this paragraph, the total dividend exceeds the profits available for distribution of the period mentioned in the said sub-paragraph (a) or the said sub-paragraph (c), as the case may be, the relevant profits shall be the profits of that period plus so much of the profits available for distribution of preceding periods (other than profits previously distributed or previously treated as relevant for the purposes of this paragraph) as is equal to the excess; and for the purposes of this proviso the profits of the most recent preceding period shall first be taken into account, then the profits of the next most recent preceding period, and so on.

10. Where—

(fl) the arrangements provide, in relation to dividends of some classes, but not in relation to dividends of other classes, that foreign income tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of dividends is to be taken into account in considering whether any, and if so what, credit is to be given against income tax in respect of the dividends; and

(6) a dividend is paid which is not of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide,

then, if the dividend is paid to a company which controls, directly or indirectly, not less than one half of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, credit shall be allowed as if the dividend were a dividend of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide.

Miscellaneous.

11. Credit shall not be allowed under the arrangements against the income tax or excess profits tax chargeable in respect of the income or profits of any person for any year of assessment or chargeable accounting period if he elects that credit shall not be allowed in the case of his income or profits for that year or period.

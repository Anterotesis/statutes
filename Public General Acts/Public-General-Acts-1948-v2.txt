1—(1) No person shall be sentenced by a court to penal Abolition servitude; and every enactment conferring power on a court of penal to pass a sentence of penal servitude in any case shall be construed as conferring power to pass a sentence of imprison- prison ment for a term not exceeding the maximum term of penal divisions, servitude for which a sentence could have been passed in that case immediately before the commencement of this Act.

(2) No person shall be sentenced by a court to imprisonment with hard labour; and every enactment conferring power on a court to pass a sentence of imprisonment with hard labour in any case shall be construed as conferring power to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the term for which a sentence of imprisonment with hard labour could have been passed in that case immediately before the commencement of this Act; and so far as any enactment requires or permits prisoners to be kept to hard labour it shall cease to have effect.

2.—No person shall be sentenced by a court to whipping; and so far as any enactment confers power on a court to pass a sentence of whipping it shall cease to have effect.

Probation and discharge.

3.—(1) Where a court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence (not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law) is of opinion that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may, instead of sentencing him, make a probation order, that is to say, an order requiring him to be under the supervision of a probation officer for a period to be specified in the order of not less than one year nor more than three years.

(2) A probation order shall name the petty sessional division in which the offender resides or will reside; and the offender shall (subject to the provisions of the First Schedule to this Act relating to probationers who change their residence) be required to be under the supervision of a probation officer appointed for or assigned to that division.

(3) Subject to the provisions of the next following section, a probation order may in addition require the offender to comply during the whole or any part of the probation period with such requirements as the court, having regard to the circumstances of the case, considers necessary for securing the good conduct of the offender or for preventing a repetition by him of the same offence or the commission of other offences:

Provided that (without prejudice to the power of the court to make an order under subsection (2) of section eleven of this Act) the payment of sums by way of damages for injury or compensation for loss shall not be included among the requirements of a probation order.

(4) Without prejudice to the generality of the last foregoing subsection, a probation order may include requirements relating to the residence of the offender:

Provided that—

(1 a) before making an order containing any such requirements, the court shall consider the home surroundings of the offender; and

1948. Criminal Justice Ch. 58. 1275

Act, 1948.

(b) where the order requires the offender to reside in an Part i. approved probation hostel, an approved probation home or any other institution, the name of the institution and the period for which he is so required to reside shall be specified in the order, and that period shall not extend beyond twelve months from the date of the order.

(5) Before making a probation order, the court shall explain to the offender in ordinary language the effect of the order (in-duding any additional requirements proposed to be inserted therein under subsection (3) or subsection (4) of this section or under the next following section) and that if he fails to comply therewith or commits another offence he will be liable to be sentenced for the original offence; and if the offender is not less than fourteen years of age the court shall not make the order unless he expresses his willingness to comply with the requirements thereof.

(6) The court by which a probation order is made shall forthwith give copies of the order to a probation officer assigned to the court, and he shall give a copy to the offender, to file probation officer responsible for the supervision of file offender and to the person in charge of any institution in which the probationer is required by the order to reside; and the court shall, except where it is itself the supervising court, send to the clerk to the justices for the petty sessional division named in the order a copy of the order, together with such documents and information relating to the case as it considers likely to be of assistance to the supervising court.

(7) Where a probation order requires the offender to reside in any institution, not being—

(a) an approved probation hostel or approved probation home; or

(b) an institution in which he is required to reside for the

purposes of any such treatment as is mentioned in paragraph (a) or paragraph (6) of subsection (2) of the next following section,

the court shall forthwith give notice of the terms of the order to the Secretary of State.

4.—(1) Where the court is satisfied, on the evidence of a probation duly qualified medical practitioner appearing to the court to orders be experienced in the diagnosis of mental disorders, that requiring the mental condition of an offender is such as requires and ^e^ent for as may be susceptible to treatment but is not such as to justify Edition, his being certified as a person of unsound mind under the 53 & 54 Lunacy Act, 1890, or as a defective under the Mental Defi- Vict. c. 5. ciency Act, 1913, the court may, if it makes a probation order, 3 Geo. 5.

(2) For the purposes of this and the next following section, the expression " agricultural land" means land used for agriculture which is so used for the purposes of a trade or business and includes any other land which, by virtue of a designation of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (hereafter in this Act referred to as " the Minister") under subsection (1) of section one hundred and nine of the Agriculture Act, 1947, is agricultural land within the meaning of that Act.

Act, 1948.

occupy land for use as agricultural land, and the circumstances are such that if his interest were a tenancy from year to year he would in respect of that land be the tenant of an agricultural holding, then, unless the letting or grant was approved by the Minister before the agreement was entered into, the agreement shall take effect, with the necessary modifications, as if it were an agreement for the letting of the land for a tenancy from year to year :

Provided that this subsection shall not have effect in relation to an agreement for the letting of land, or the granting of a licence to occupy land, made (whether or not the agreement expressly so provides) in contemplation of the use of the land only for grazing or mowing during some specified period of the year, or to an agreement for the letting of land, or the granting of a licence to occupy land, by a person whose interest in the land is less than a tenancy from year to year and has not by virtue of this section taken effect as such a tenancy.

(2) Any dispute arising as to the operation of the foregoing subsection in relation to any agreement shall be determined by arbitration under this Act.

3.—(1) A tenancy of an agricultural holding for a term of two Tenancies for years or upwards shall, instead of terminating on the expiration two years or of the term for which it was granted, continue (as from the expira- more* unless tion of that term) as a tenancy from year to year, but otherwise ^r^dto the terms of the original tenancy so far as applicable, unless, continued not less than, one year nor more than two years before the date tenancies fod for the expiration of the term, a written notice has been from year given by either party to the other of his intention to terminateto y*"-the tenancy.

(2) A notice given under the foregoing subsection shall be doomed, for the purposes of this Act, to be a notice to quit.

then determined by effluxion of time or other lawful means during the continuance of his landlord’s estate.

(2) The succeeding landlord shall be entitled to recover from the tenant, in the same manner as his predecessor could have done, a fair proportion of the rent for the period which may have elapsed from the date of the death or cesser of the estate of his predecessor to the time of the tenant so quitting.

5. —(1) Where there is not in force in respect of a tenancy of an agricultural holding, whether created before or after the commencement of this Act, an agreement in writing embodying the terms of the tenancy, or there is such an agreement in force but it contains no provision for one or more of the matters specified in the First Schedule to this Act, the landlord or the tenant of the holding may, if he has requested his tenant a landlord to enter into such an agreement containing provision for all of the said matters but no such agreement has been concluded, refer the terms of the tenancy to arbitration under this Act.

(2) On any such reference the arbitrator shall by his award specify the existing terms of the tenancy, subject to any variations thereof agreed between the landlord and the tenant, and, in so far as those terms as so varied make no provision therefor and do not make provision inconsistent therewith, make provision for all the matters specified in the First Schedule to this Act having such effect as may be agreed between the landlord and the tenant or, in default of agreement, as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable and just between the landlord and the tenant.

(3) On any such arbitration the arbitrator may include in his award any further provisions relating to the tenancy which may be agreed between the landlord and file tenant.

6. —(1) The Minister may, after consultation with such bodies of persons as appear to him to represent the interests of landlords and tenants of agricultural holdings, make regulations prescribing terms as to the maintenance, repair and insurance of fixed equipment which shall be deemed to be incorporated in every contract of tenancy of an agricultural holding, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, except in so far as they would impose on one of the parties to an agreement in writing a liability which under the agreement is imposed on the other.

the preceding provisions of this Act for investigation and

report is not so framed as to limit the investigation and

report to the facts, it may, if the Board of Trade think fit, be so framed as to require the Commission, if they find that conditions to which this Act applies prevail, thereafter to

things as are specified in the reference are done by the parties concerned as a result of. or for the purpose of preserving, those conditions, and, if so, whether or not any of those things operate or may be expected to operate against the public interest.

(3) A reference of a matter to the Commission under the preceding provisions of this Act for investigation and report may, where the matter referred relates to the supply of goods of any description or the application of any process to goods of any description, be so framed as to require the Commission to confine their investigation to the supply of the goods, or the application of the process to the goods, in a specified part of the United Kingdom.

(4) Subject to the following provisions of this subsection, the prices to be charged by an Area Board for the supply of gas by them shall be in accordance with such tariffs as may be fixed from time to time by them, and those tariffs shall be so framed as to show the methods by which and the principles on which the charges are to be made as well as the prices which are to be charged, and shall be published in such manner as in the opinion of the Area Board will secure adequate publicity for them :

Provided that—

(a) the tariffs in force immediately before the vesting date

Provided that an Area Board shall not enter into such agreements except in cases where the tariffs in force are not appropriate owing to special circumstances.

(7) An Area Board, in fixing tariffs and making agreements under this section, shall not show undue preference to any person or class of persons and shall not exercise any undue discrimination against any person or class of persons.

Where the repayable contributions exceed £200, the capitalised value of the pension payable under section 13, and, consequently, the figures in the Table, must be increased. Similarly, where the only pension payable is the pension of capitalised value 200 payable under section 12, the figures in the Table, which are calculated on -£400, will suffer a proportionate decrease.

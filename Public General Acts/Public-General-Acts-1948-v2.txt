3.—(1) Where a court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence (not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law) is of opinion that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may, instead of sentencing him, make a probation order, that is to say, an order requiring him to be under the supervision of a probation officer for a period to be specified in the order of not less than one year nor more than three years.

(2) A probation order shall name the petty sessional division in which the offender resides or will reside; and the offender shall (subject to the provisions of the First Schedule to this Act relating to probationers who change their residence) be required to be under the supervision of a probation officer appointed for or assigned to that division.

(3) Subject to the provisions of the next following section, a probation order may in addition require the offender to comply during the whole or any part of the probation period with such requirements as the court, having regard to the circumstances of the case, considers necessary for securing the good conduct of the offender or for preventing a repetition by him of the same offence or the commission of other offences:

Provided that (without prejudice to the power of the court to make an order under subsection (2) of section eleven of this Act) the payment of sums by way of damages for injury or compensation for loss shall not be included among the requirements of a probation order.

(4) Without prejudice to the generality of the last foregoing subsection, a probation order may include requirements relating to the residence of the offender:

Provided that—

(1 a) before making an order containing any such requirements, the court shall consider the home surroundings of the offender; and

(b) where the order requires the offender to reside in an Part i. approved probation hostel, an approved probation home or any other institution, the name of the institution and the period for which he is so required to reside shall be specified in the order, and that period shall not extend beyond twelve months from the date of the order.

(5) Before making a probation order, the court shall explain to the offender in ordinary language the effect of the order (in-duding any additional requirements proposed to be inserted therein under subsection (3) or subsection (4) of this section or under the next following section) and that if he fails to comply therewith or commits another offence he will be liable to be sentenced for the original offence; and if the offender is not less than fourteen years of age the court shall not make the order unless he expresses his willingness to comply with the requirements thereof.

(6) The court by which a probation order is made shall fortnwith give copies of the order to a probation officer assigned to the court, and he shall give a copy to the offender, to file probation officer responsible for the supervision of file offender and to the person in charge of any institution in which the probationer is required by the order to reside; and the court shall, except where it is itself the supervising court, send to the clerk to the justices for the petty sessional division named in the order a copy of the order, together with such documents and information relating to the case as it considers likely to be of assistance to the supervising court.

(7) Where a probation order requires the offender to reside in any institution, not being—

(a) an approved probation hostel or approved probation home; or

(b) an institution in which he is required to reside for the

purposes of any such treatment as is mentioned in paragraph (a) or paragraph (6) of subsection (2) of the next following section,

(2) For the purposes of this and the next following section, the expression “ agricultural land" means land used for agriculture which is so used for the purposes of a trade or business and includes any other land which, by virtue of a designation of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ the Minister") under subsection (1) of section one hundred and nine of the Agriculture Act, 1947, is agricultural land within the meaning of that Act.

Act, 1948.

occupy land for use as agricultural land, and the circumstances are such that if his interest were a tenancy from year to year he would in respect of that land be the tenant of an agricultural holding, then, unless the letting or grant was approved by the Minister before the agreement was entered into, the agreement shall take effect, with the necessary modifications, as if it were an agreement for the letting of the land for a tenancy from year to year :

Provided that this subsection shall not have effect in relation to an agreement for the letting of land, or the granting of a licence to occupy land, made (whether or not the agreement expressly so provides) in contemplation of the use of the land only for grazing or mowing during some specified period of the year, or to an agreement for the letting of land, or the granting of a licence to occupy land, by a person whose interest in the land is less than a tenancy from year to year and has not by virtue of this section taken effect as such a tenancy.

(2) Any dispute arising as to the operation of the foregoing subsection in relation to any agreement shall be determined by arbitration under this Act.

3.—(1) A tenancy of an agricultural holding for a term of two Tenancies for years or upwards shall, instead of terminating on the expiration two years or of the term for which it was granted, continue (as from the expira- more* unless tion of that term) as a tenancy from year to year, but otherwise ^r^dto the terms of the original tenancy so far as applicable, unless, continued not less than, one year nor more than two years before the date tenancies fod for the expiration of the term, a written notice has been from year given by either party to the other of his intention to terminateto y*"-the tenancy.

(2) A notice given under the foregoing subsection shall be doomed, for the purposes of this Act, to be a notice to quit.

then determined by effluxion of time or other lawful means during the continuance of his landlord’s estate.

5. —(1) Where there is not in force in respect of a tenancy of an agricultural holding, whether created before or after the commencement of this Act, an agreement in writing embodying the terms of the tenancy, or there is such an agreement in force but it contains no provision for one or more of the matters specified in the First Schedule to this Act, the landlord or the tenant of the holding may, if he has requested his tenant a landlord to enter into such an agreement containing provision for all of the said matters but no such agreement has been concluded, refer the terms of the tenancy to arbitration under this Act.

(2) On any such reference the arbitrator shall by his award specify the existing terms of the tenancy, subject to any variations thereof agreed between the landlord and the tenant, and, in so far as those terms as so varied make no provision therefor and do not make provision inconsistent therewith, make provision for all the matters specified in the First Schedule to this Act having such effect as may be agreed between the landlord and the tenant or, in default of agreement, as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable and just between the landlord and the tenant.

(3) On any such arbitration the arbitrator may include in his award any further provisions relating to the tenancy which may be agreed between the landlord and file tenant.

6. —(1) The Minister may, after consultation with such bodies of persons as appear to him to represent the interests of landlords and tenants of agricultural holdings, make regulations prescribing terms as to the maintenance, repair and insurance of fixed equipment which shall be deemed to be incorporated in every contract of tenancy of an agricultural holding, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, except in so far as they would impose on one of the parties to an agreement in writing a liability which under the agreement is imposed on the other.

report to the facts, it may, if the Board of Trade think fit, be so framed as to require the Commission, if they find that conditions to which this Act applies prevail, thereafter to

Where the repayable contributions exceed £200, the capitalised value of the pension payable under section 13, and, consequently, the figures in the Table, must be increased. Similarly, where the only pension payable is the pension of capitalised value 200 payable under section 12, the figures in the Table, which are calculated on -£400, will suffer a proportionate decrease.

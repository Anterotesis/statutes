(3) The standard percentage and any special percentage shall be such as may be specified by order made by the Minister, after consultation with such organisations representing employers and workers respectively, or both employers and workers, as he thinks fit, and an order assigning a special percentage shall contain such provisions as may appear to the Minister to be requisite for more particularly aenning for the purposes of this section the trade or industry, branch or part of a trade or industry, or class of employer, to employment in which or with whom the percentage is assigned.

11.—(1) On an application in that behalf being made in the prescribed manner by any person to whom section nine of this Act applies, the Minister may grant a permit for the purposes of subsection (4) of that section if it appears to him to be expedient so to do having regard to the nature of the work for which the applicant desires to take a person or persons into his employment and the qualifications and the suitability for the work of any person or persons registered as handicapped by disablement who may be available therefor, or if he is satisfied that there is no such person or an insufficient number of such persons available therefor.

(2) A permit may be granted either unconditionally or subject to any conditions relating to the employment of the person or persons to whom the permit relates, and may be

1944- Disabled Persons (Employment) Ch. io. 25

Act, 1944.

granted as respects the employment either of one or more persons specified or described therein or of a specified number of persons.

(3) If on an application being made as aforesaid the Minister is not satisfied that the case is one in which any permit, or such a permit as is applied for, ought to be granted, or is of opinion that conditions to which the applicant objects ought to be attached to a grant, then, if the applicant so requests, the Minister shall refer the application to a district advisory committee for their recommendations and shall determine what permit (if any) ought to be granted, and subject to what conditions (if any), only after considering the recommendations of the committee.

12.—(1) The Minister may, after consultation with Appropriation such organisations representing employers and workers of vacancies respectively, or both employers and workers, as he ^S^nients thinks fit, by order designate classes of employment eto registered as classes to which this section is to apply, being persons only, such classes of employment as appear to him to afford specially suitable opportunities for the employment of disabled persons.

(2) Subject as mentioned in the next succeeding subsection no person shall take, or offer to take, into his employment in an employment of a class to which this section applies any person other than a person registered as handicapped by disablement, or cause or permit a person in his employment other than a person registered as handicapped by disable- x ment to take up with him employment of a class to which this section applies.

(3) The provisions as to taking a person into employment in pursuance of a statutory or contractual obligation, and as to permits, of subsections (3) and (4) of section nine, and of section eleven, of this Act shall have effect in relation to the last preceding subsection as they have effect in relation to subsection (2) of section nine of mis Act.

(4) Any person who contravenes subsection (2) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.

(b) as not including any reference to the taking into his employment, by a person taking over a business or establishment at any time in succession to, or jointly with, another person who was carrying it on immediately before that time, of a person employed in that business or establishment immediately before that time.

(3) With respect to part-time employment, or to employment part-time with one employer and part-time with another or with the same employer part-time in one class of employment and part-time in another, the Minister may make regulations prescribing the extent and manner to and in which such employment is to be regarded for the purposes of this Act.

And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect of the said loan was extinguished without prejudice to the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay the said loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said collateral security is the sole security for the repayment of the said loan:

And whereas the terms of the said collateral security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the surplus herring brand fees, as defined in clause three of the said memorandum, was pledged in security for the repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan, and it was provided that the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees of any one year should only be applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of principal and interest on outstanding principal falling due under the security for the said loan in the same year, and should not be applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal:

Now, therefore, the said principal sum of four hundred and fifty-seven pounds shall be extinguished, and the said arrears of interest amounting to twenty-five pounds one shilling shall be remitted.

4.—(1) If and so long as it appears to the Public Works Loan Commissioners that their secretary is through illness, absence or other sufficient cause unable to act, they may authorise any of their assistant secretaries to perform all or any of the functions of their secretary, and anything done by an* assistant secretary in pursuance of any such authority shall have the same effect as if done by the secretary.

37. Section forty-nine of the Finance Act, 1940, shall, with the necessary adaptations, apply to the determination, for the purposes of Part IV of that Act, of any loss sustained by a company as it applies to the determination for the purposes thereof of the net income of a company.

Amendment as to avoidance of duplication of charge where deceased has received benefits from a company.

38. For subsection (2) of section fifty-one of the Finance Act, 1940 (which contains provisions for preventing the duplication of charge of estate duty in certain cases) there shall be substituted the following subsections—

“ (2) Where the following conditions are satisfied, that is to say, that any benefits accrued to the deceased from the company by virtue of any interest that he at any time had in shares in or debentures of the company, or by virtue of a power's having at any time been exercisable by him or with his consent in relation to shares in or debentures of the company, and apart from this subsection estate- duty would be payable on the death both on the value of those shares or debentures by virtue of any of the enactments relating to that duty other than section forty-six of this Act and on the proportion of the value of the company’s assets that corresponds to the benefits that so accrued to him by virtue of that section, then—

(a) if the value of the shares or debentures is equal to,

or greater than, the said proportion, or if the Commissioners are satisfied that the said proportion would not, if fully ascertained, be found to be substantially in excess of the value of the shares or debentures, duty on the said proportion shall not be payable;

(b) in any other case, the amount on which duty is to be

charged in respect of the said proportion shall be reduced by the amount of the value of the shares or debentures.

(2A) Where the conditions set out in the last preceding subsection would be satisfied but for the fact that, by reason of an exemption from estate duty (not being an exemption on the ground that the deceased or other person having an interest in the shares or debentures ceasing on the death of the deceased had only an interest as the holder of an office), that duty is not payable on the value of the shares or debentures, paragraphs (a) and (b) of that subsection shall apply as if that exemption did not operate and as if the duty had been payable on the value of the shares and debentures accordingly:

(b) since the date of that death or disposition, as the

case may be, the shares or debentures have been substantially increased in value by reason of a transfer of property to any company by any person or by reason of the extinguishment' of, or any alteration of the rights attaching to, shares in-or debentures of any company,

then, unless the exemption takes the form of a deduction from the value of the shares or debentures of a fixed amount which is independent of the value of the shares or debentures, the references in paragraphs (a) and (6) of the last preceding subsection to the value of the shares or debentures therein mentioned shall have effect as if they were references to the value thereof reduced to the extent to which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, that value is attributable to that transfer, extinguishment or alteration.

(2B) Where, by reason of an exemption from estate duty, that duty is payable on part only of the value of the shares or debentures, subsection (2) of this section shall, with the necessary adaptations, be applied to the part of the value of the shares or debentures on which duty is payable and subsection (2A) of this section shall be applied to the part of the value of the shares or debentures affected by the exemption ; and, where there are two or more exemptions from estate duty each of which operates on part only of the value of the shares or debentures and the exemptions are such that the said subsection (2A) would operate differently in relation to them, then, whether or not there is any pail of the value of the shares or debentures on which estate duty is payable, the said subsection (2A) shall, with the necessary adaptations, be applied separately in relation to the parts of the value of the shares or debentures affected by each exemption.

(2c) In this section the expression " exemption from estate duty” includes any exemption conferred by any provision of the enactments relating to estate duty which has the effect of exempting property, in whole or in part, from the duty, whether that provision takes the form that the property is not to be deemed to pass, or the form that the duty is not to be payable, or the form that a deduction is to be made from the value of the property, or any other

Where any income which, but for the operation of the law relating to trading with the enemy, would be chargeable to income tax for any year of assessment apart from this paragraph becomes payable to a custodian, the same assessments to income tax (other than surtax) shall be made for that year on the custodian in respect of income from the source from which that income arose as might have been made on any person if the person who, but for the operation of the said law, would have been entitled to the income had been so entitled.

2. Where an assessment is made on a custodian under paragraph 1 of this Part of this Schedule in respect of any income, or any income which is paid subject to deduction of income tax is received by a custodian, and, in either case, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue that, but for the operation of the law relating to trading with the enemy, the person who, but for the operation of that law, would have been assessable to, or would have borne, the tax on that income, would, if a claim were made in that behalf, have been granted relief from all or any of the tax, the same relief shall be granted to the custodian by repayment or otherwise.

3. Where an assessment is made on a custodian under paragraph 1 of this Part of this Schedule in respect of any income, or any income which is paid subject to deduction of income tax is received by a custodian, and, in either case, it appears that, but for the operation of the law relating to trading with the enemy, the income would have been taken into account in computing the total income of an individual for surtax purposes, that income shall be deemed for surtax purposes to be income of that individual and the same assessments to surtax may, without any notice to make a return being served on the custodian or that individual, be made on the custodian in respect of the income as might have been made on that individual or his executors or administrators if it had been his income and, where that individual has other income, if it were treated as the highest part of his total income :

Provided that where, in the case of any individual, assessments to surtax under this paragraph for any year of assessment could, apart from this proviso, be made on two or more custodians, one of those custodians (to be selected by the Special Commissioners) shall be assessed to surtax for that year in respect of all income to which this paragraph applies in relation to that individual.

4. Where, in the case of any individual who, but for the operation of the law relating to trading with the enemy, would be entitled to any income which is payable to a custodian, the Special Commissioners,

Section 42.

7 & 8 Geo. 6,

4th Sch. on any information before them, are of opinion that any income (not —coni. being income to which the preceding paragraphs of this Part of this

Schedule apply) would, if notice to make a return were served on that individual, fall to be included in his total income for surtax purposes, they may, without any notice to make a return being served on him or any notice of assessment, make an assessment to surtax upon that individual in respect of that income.

Payment of tax by custodian.

5. A custodian shall, save as expressly provided in this Part of this Schedule, pay or cause to be paid, out of money in his hands to which some other person would be entitled but for the operation of the law relating to trading with the enemy, any income tax (including surtax) assessed on a custodian by virtue of paragraph 1 or paragraph 3 of this Part of this Schedule, which, but for the operation of that law, would have been chargeable on or borne by that other person.

6. —(1) A custodian shall, on demand of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue as respects tax other than surtax, and on demand of the Special Commissioners as respects surtax, pay or cause to be paid, out of money in his hands to which some other person would be entitled but for the operation of the law relating to trading with the enemy, any sum stated in the demand to be due from that person in respect of income tax other than surtax, or in respect of surtax, as the case may be, for whatever year of assessment (including years before the year 1939-40).

(2) Any sum paid by a custodian in pursuance of such a demand shall be deemed for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts to have been paid by the person who is stated in the demand to be the person from whom it is due.

(3) A sum may be included in any such demand as aforesaid notwithstanding that the relevant assessment is, or is still capable of being, the subject of an appeal.

Effect of release of property or income by custodian.

7. Where a custodian releases to or for the benefit of, or to the personal representatives of, any person who has ceased to be an enemy or has died everything in the custodian's hands to which that person or his personal representatives, as the case may be, would, but for the operation of the law relating to trading with the enemy, be entitled—

(a) any income which, but for the operation of that law, would have belonged to that person or to some person under whom he claims, shall thereafter be treated for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts as having been income of the person whose income it would have been for those purposes but for the operation of the said law;

(b) all income tax (including surtax) paid by deduction or other-

wise by a custodian in respect of any such income shall thereafter be treated as having been paid by, and all reliefs allowed

1944-

Finance Act, 1944.

Ch. 23.

137

to a custodian in respect of any such income shall thereafter be treated as having been allowed to, the last-mentioned person; and

(c) appeals may thereafter be brought by the last-mentioned person or his personal representatives against any assessment (including any assessment to surtax) made on a custodian in respect of any such income as if the assessment had been made on him.

8. Where an assessment is made under any of the preceding provisions of this Part of this Schedule on a custodian and, whether before or after the making of the assessment, the income or any part thereof is paid, transferred or released, or permitted to be paid or transferred, to any other person by the custodian, so much, if any, of the tax payable by virtue of the assessment as cannot, under the preceding provisions of this Part of this Schedule, be paid by the custodian shall be a debt due to the Crown—

(a) in a case to which the last preceding paragraph applies, from

the person whose income it is, under that paragraph, treated as having been, or his personal representatives; and

(b) in any other case, from the person to whom the income is so

paid, transferred or released,

and may be recovered accordingly, and the custodian shall cease to be liable in respect of the tax.

Relaxation of time limits.

9. Notwithstanding anything in the Income Tax Acts limiting the time for making assessments, assessments may be made under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Part of this Schedule at any time before such, date as Parliament may hereafter determine, and any appeal against any such assessment, and any claim made either by a custodian or by virtue of paragraph 7 of this Part of this Schedule to relief from tax, may, notwithstanding anything in the Income Tax Acts restricting the time for bringing appeals or making claims for relief, be brought or made at any time before the said date.

Supplementary.

10. For the purposes of paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Part of this Schedule it shall, except so far as the contrary is proved, be assumed that nothing has occurred since the third day of September, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, to change the persons who, but for the operation of the law relating to trading with the enemy, would be entitled to any money or property, or to income therefrom, and any assessment under paragraph 1 or paragraph 3 of this Part of this Schedule shall specify the person who has been taken to be the person who, but for the operation of the said law, would have been entitled to the relevant income.

11. Where income from any source for any year of assessment would become payable to a custodian but for the fact that no income from that source is available for payment in that year, but, apart from the operation of the law relating to trading with the enemy, income tax would nevertheless be chargeable in respect of income from that source for that year, the provisions of this Part of this Schedule shall have effect as if income from that source had been available for payment in that year and become payable to the custodian.

3. On the death of a person who, immediately before his death, would, but for the operation of the law relating to trading with the enemy, have been entitled to any property in the hands of or money payable to a custodian, the custodian shall be accountable for any estate duty in respect of any property of which the deceased would, but for the operation of the said law, have been competent to dispose at his death, but shall not be liable for any duty in excess of the amount which can be raised from, or from the proceeds of, property which is in his hands when he first receives notice of the death or which thereafter comes into his hands, being in either case property of which the deceased would have been competent to dispose as aforesaid.

Provided that, as soon as the Minister is satisfied that it has become practicable to raise to sixteen the upper limit of the compulsory school age, he shall lay before Parliament the draft of an Order in Council directing that the foregoing provisions of this section shall have effect as if for references therein to the age of fifteen years there were substituted references to the age of sixteen years ; and unless either House of Parliament, within the period of forty days beginning with the day on which any such draft as aforesaid is laid before it, resolves that the draft be not presented to His Majesty, His Majesty may by Order in Council direct accordingly.

In reckoning any such period of forty days, no .account shall be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which both Houses are adjourned for more than four days.

36, It shall be the duty of the parent of every child of compulsory school age to cause him to receive efficient full-time education suitable to his age, ability, and aptitude, either by regular attendance at school or otherwise.

Provided that before serving such an order upon a parent the authority shall, where practicable, afford him an opportunity of selecting the school to be named in the order, and if a school is selected by him, that school shall, unless the Minister otherwise directs, be the school named in the order.

(3) If the local education authority are of opinion that the school selected by the parent as the school to be named in a school attendance order is unsuitable to the age, ability or aptitude of the child with respect to whom the order is to be made, or that the attendance of the child at the school so selected would involve unreasonable expense to the authority, the authority may, after giving to the parent notice of their intention to do so, apply to the Minister for a dilection determining what school is to be named in the order.

(4) If at any time while a school attendance order is in force with respect to any child the parent of the child makes application to the local education authority by whom the order was made requesting that another school be substituted for that named in the order, or requesting that the order be revoked on the ground that arrangements have been made for the child to receive efficient full-time education suitable to his age, ability, and aptitude otherwise than at school, the authority shall amend or revoke the order in compliance with the request unless they are of opinion that the proposed change of school is unreasonable or inexpedient in the interests of the child, or that no satisfactory arrangements have been made for the education of the child otherwise than at school, as the case may be; and if a parent is aggrieved by a refusal of the authority to comply with any such request, he may refer the question to the Minister, who shall give such direction thereon as he thinks fit.

(5) If any person upon whom a school attendance order is served fails to comply with the requirements of the order, he shall be guilty of an offence against this section unless he proves that he is causing the child to receive efficient full-time education suitable to his age, ability, and aptitude otherwise than at school.

(6) If in proceedings against any person for a failure to comply with a school attendance order that person is acquitted, the court may direct that the school attendance order shall cease to be in force, but without prejudice to the duty of the local education authority to take further action under this section if at any time the authority are of opinion that having regard to any change of circumstances it is expedient so to do.

The amount in the pound ascertained in respect of any elementary education authority under paragraph 2 of this Schedule is hereinafter referred to as the actual rate poundage of the authority, and the amount in the pound ascertained under paragraph 3 of this Schedule is hereinafter referred to as the notional rate poundage.

5. The Minister shall ascertain in the case of every elementary education authority in the county the amount of the difference between the actual rate poundage of the authority and the notional rate poundage, and where the notional rate poundage exceeds the actual rate poundage of an authority the difference is hereinafter referred to as the rate disadvantage of that authority, and where the notional rate poundage is less than the actual rate poundage of an authority the difference is hereinafter referred to as the rate advantage of that authority.

Part II.

1. If the rate disadvantage of any elementary education authority in any county is more than sixpence, but not otherwise, the Minister may, after consultation with the county council, make an order for the county under this Part of this Schedule.

2. Any such order shall come into operation on the date of the commencement of Part II of this Act and no such order shall remain in force after the expiration of the period of five years from that date. 3

3. The number of years during which (subject to the provisions of the last foregoing paragraph) an order made under this Part of this Schedule shall continue in force shall be the quotient which results from dividing by six the amount of the rate disadvantage of the elementary education authority having the greatest rate disadvantage in the county.

In making any calculation for the purposes of this paragraph, fractions shall be disregarded

1944- Education , 1944. Ch. 31.

4. An order made under this Part of this Schedule for any county shall provide that in each year during which the order is in force the precepts issued by the county council in accordance with section nine of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, for general county purposes shall, instead of being of the same amount in the case of each rating authority as required by that section, be increased or decreased by such amount in the pound as may be determined by the order, being an amount calculated, in the case of a precept issued to a rating authority which is an elementary education authority by reference to the rate advantage or disadvantage of that authority, and in the case of a precept issued to any other rating authority by reference to the rate advantage or disadvantage of the county council.

5. The amount by which the precept issued to a rating authority is to be required by the order to be increased or decreased in any financial year shall be a fraction of the rate advantage or disadvantage by reference to which the amount is to be calculated; anc[ the denominator of the said fraction shall be the total number of years, increased by one, comprised in the period for which the order has effect, and the numerator thereof shall be :—

(«) in the case of the first year for which the order has effect, one less than the denominator, and

(6) in the case of each subsequent year, one less than the numerator in the case of the previous year.

(b) if he is satisfied that any of the conditions precedent to

the valid giving of the notice is not fulfilled, shall within the said period direct that the notice shall not take effect;

(c) if he is satisfied that, having regard to the benefit which

(a) shall not be exercisable where the application is made

after the time certified under subsection (1) of this section in relation to any description of buildings which would be comprised in the land after the carrying out of the development for permission for which application is made;

(b) where the application is made before the said time, shall

not be exercisable so as to postpone the consideration of the application beyond the said time.

(4) The provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall apply in relation to an application for permission for development made under a planning scheme as they apply in relation to an interim development application, but with the substitution for the references to the interim development authority of a reference to the responsible authority (that is to say, the authority responsible for enforcing and carrying out the relevant provisions of the scheme), and for the reference in paragraph (6) of the said subsection (1) to development for which permission would be granted of a reference to development which could be carried out in conformity with the provisions of the scheme or of permission granted thereunder.

(5) Any question arising under this section or under the proviso to subsection (4) of section two of this Act as to the meaning of the expression “ reasonably beneficial use ” shall be determined as follows:—

(a) land shall be deemed to have been rendered incapable of

reasonably beneficial use if it was immediately after the occurrence of the war damage in question in a state such as to make it incapable of being as beneficially used while remaining in that state as it was immediately before the occurrence of the damage, and shall be deemed to remain incapable of reasonably beneficial use so long as it is in such a state as aforesaid ;

(b) land shall be deemed to have been rendered capable of

reasonably beneficial use, and an alternative development of land shall be deemed to be such as would render land

1944- Town and Country Planning Ch. 47.

capable of reasonably beneficial use, if the land has been brought, or the development would bring the land, as the case may be, into a state such as to make it capable of being as beneficially used while remaining in that state as it was immediately before the occurrence of the war damage in question.

(6) In determining whether there is alternative development which could be carried out so as to render land capable of reasonably beneficial use, regard shall be had to the extent to which any use would involve forgoing the benefit of any buildings or works or parts thereof remaining on the land and still having value.

(7) For the purposes of paragraph of subsection (1) of this section alternative development may be treated as being such as could be carried out so as to render land capable of reasonably beneficial use, notwithstanding that it would not otherwise be so treated, if it is equitable so to do having regard to any contribution which the owner will receive under subsection (4) of section ten of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, in respect of the refusal of an interim development application, and in con-c sidering whether it is equitable to give a direction under paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of this section, the Minister shall have regard to any such contribution.

(8) Any question arising under paragraph ( ) of subsection (1) of this section or under the last preceding subsection shall be determined by the Minister; and, subject to the preceding provisions of this subsection, any such question as is mentioned in subsection (5) of this section shall be determined by the War Damage Commission.

(9) The purchase of any interest by a local authority in purported pursuance of this section shall be conclusive evidence that every condition precedent to the authority being empowered to purchase the interest has been fulfilled :

Provided that this subsection shall not prejudice the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, or the effect of any direction given under that subsection. 10

(10) A county council may contribute towards the expenses incurred by a local planning authority under this section, and section forty-nine of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932 (which provides for the manner in which expenses of county councils under that Act are to be defrayed and confers on county councils power to borrow), except the first proviso thereto, shall apply to expenses incurred by a county council under this subsection as it applies to such of their expenses as are mentioned in the said section forty-nine.

(4) Where this paragraph has effect as respects a purchase the subject of which comprises, but does not consist solely of, the interest in question in the land in the hereditament, the compensation for the purchase shall be ascertained, and all statutory provisions relating to the ascertainment thereof or to the carrying out of the purchase or to matters connected therewith shall have effect, subject to any agreement between the purchasing authority and other parties concerned, as if the interest in question in that land had been purchased separately and separate notices to treat had been served accordingly, and had been served simultaneously.

2.—(1) Where by virtue of paragraph 1 of this Schedule the value of the land comprised in a hereditament is to be taken for the purposes of the ascertainment of compensation to be its certified after-damage value (or that value as adjusted), and notices to treat have been served in respect of two or more interests in the whole of that land on the same date or within such period as may be fixed as respects that land under rules, the compensation to be paid for the purchase of each of those interests shall be ascertained in accordance with the following provisions of this paragraph.

(2) The amount representing the value of each of those interests as it would have fallen to be ascertained if this paragraph had not had effect in relation thereto shall be agreed, assessed or determined in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraphs (3) to (7) of this paragraph, and the compensation to be paid for the purchase of each interest shall be the proportion of the certified after-damage value of the land, or of that value as adjusted, as the case may be, which the amount agreed, assessed or determined in respect of that interest bears to the aggregate of the amounts agreed, assessed or determined in respect of the several interests:

Provided that if the interests in question do not include all interests subsisting in the land at the date or at the expiration of the period aforesaid, an amount representing the value of any excluded interest, as it would have fallen to be ascertained if that interest had been purchased and this paragraph had not had effect in relation thereto, shall be agreed, assessed or determined in accordance with the said provisions and added to the said aggregate.

(3) If the values of the several interests in question and of any 8th Sch.

•excluded interest are not otherwise agreed, the claimant in respect of —cont.

each of the interests in question, and the purchasing authority as

respects any excluded interest, shall cause an estimate of the value of that interest to be made and transmitted to an officer of the Valuation Office appointed by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, and that officer shall, after considering the estimates, take steps in accordance with rules for securing if possible agreement between the claimants, and, if there is any excluded interest, the purchasing authority, as to the value of each interest.

(4) In default of agreement as to the value of any interest the said officer shall make an assessment of the value of that interest.

(5) The costs of the employment by a claimant of a person skilled in valuation to advise or act for him for the purposes of either of the two last preceding sub-paragraphs on a purchase by a local or public authority within the meaning of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, shall be paid by the authority.

(6) If any claimant, or, if there is any excluded interest, the purchasing authority, is aggrieved by an assessment made by the said officer, the claimant or the authority may in accordance with rules require the value of the interest dealt with by the assessment to be determined by one of the panel of arbitrators appointed under section one of the said Act of 1919.

(7) If in respect of any Qf the interests in question no claim is duly made within the time prescribed by rules, an independent person skilled in valuation may be appointed in accordance with rules to act for the purposes of sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) of this paragraph in respect of that interest, and those sub-paragraphs shall have effect as if all things done thereunder by the person so appointed had been duly authorised, by all persons concerned in respect of the interest in question, to be done by that person as agent for them.

(8) Where the last preceding sub-paragraph has had effect as respects any interest and the value thereof has been agreed or assessed under sub-paragraph (3) or (4) of this paragraph, if any person who would have been entitled but for this paragraph to have any question of disputed compensation in relation to that interest referred to arbitration in accordance with the said Act of 1919 shows in accordance with rules that the fact that no claim was made as aforesaid was not attributable to any default on his part, he may in accordance with rules require the value of that interest to be determined by one of the panel of arbitrators appointed under section one of the said Act of 1919, and if the compensation on the basis of the value of the interest as so determined is greater or less than the compensation on the basis of the value thereof as agreed or assessed as aforesaid, the difference shall be recoverable by the person entitled to the compensation from the purchasing authority or by the authority from him, as the case may be.

(9) The costs of any arbitration under sub-paragraph (6) or (8) of this paragraph, including any fees charges and expenses of the arbitration or award, shall be in the discretion of the official arbitrator, who may direct to and by whom and in what manner those costs or any part thereof shall be paid, and the official arbitrator may in any case disallow the costs of counsel.

(3) In the case of any such incumbent as aforesaid, regard shall be had, both in framing the reorganisation scheme and in determining the amount and duration of any annuity, to his rights, expectations and obligations under the Clergy Pensions Measures, 1926 to 1936, or (as the case may be) the

(c) in the case of any such incumbent who for the time being holds no benefice, his decision to accept no offer of further preferment shall be deemed to be retirement; and

(d) the annual value of a benefice which by reason of a reorganisation scheme ceases to exist shall be determined by the pensions authority instead of by a commission.

(7) Where an incumbent is compelled as a consequence of a reorganisation scheme to change his residence, he shall be entitled, whether he receives an annuity or not, to such lump sum, to be stated in the scheme, in respect of expenses incurred by him as, in default of agreement, the diocesan reorganisation committee, or, upon an objection, the Special Committee, may determine to be fair and reasonable, regard being had to all the circumstances of the case.

(8) The provisions of the last preceding subsection (except the words referring to an annuity) shall apply also in relation to an assistant curate as they apply in relation to an incumbent.

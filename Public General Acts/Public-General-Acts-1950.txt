Provided that in giving any such direction the Treasury may themselves impose conditions for restricting the use or disposal of the goods and may authorise the Commissioners to impose conditions for the protection of the revenue and, where conditions are imposed by or under the direction given with respect to any goods, the said subsection shall apply to any of the goods only if and so long as those conditions are complied with and (where the Commissioners so require) security is given that they will be complied with.

(2) So long as this subsection applies to any goods, payment shall not be required of any of the following duties of customs which may be chargeable in respect of the importation of the goods, that is to say—

(5) The Board of Trade shall not make a recommendation under this section about any goods except on a written application made by the importer before delivery of the goods to him.

12.—(1) A scheme under section nine of the Finance Act, 1932, for allowing, in the case of goods of any class or description, a drawback of import duties in respect of any material used in the manufacture of those goods may make provision as follows, that is to say: —

(a) instead of providing in accordance with paragraph () of subsection (2) of the said section nine for the allowance of drawback in respect either of the quantity of the relevant material actually contained in the goods or of such average quantity of material as is mentioned in that paragraph, the scheme may provide for the allowance of drawback in respect of the quantity of the relevant material actually contained in the goods together with such additional quantity as may be specified in the scheme as being the appropriate allowance for wastage in the manufacture of the goods; ib) the scheme may specify a rate of drawback exceeding the limit imposed by paragraph (c) of the said subsection (2), if the rate specified is such as would not exceed that limit were the limit imposed by reference to the average amount of duty paid in respect, not of all duty-paid material of the relevant class or description, but of such of that material as is used, either by manufacturers generally or by any particular manufacturer, in the manufacture either of all goods of the relevant class or description or of such goods of that class or description as are manufactured for export;

(c) instead of specifying a rate of drawback for the relevant material in accordance with the said paragraph (c), the scheme may divide the material into two or more categories (by reference to the duty paid or otherwise) and specify a rate for each category as if it were a separate class or description of material for purposes of the scheme.

(2) Any additional quantity specified under paragraph (a) of the foregoing subsection as being the appropriate allowance for wastage shall be fixed as so much per cent, (by the same measure of quantity as is used in fixing the rate of drawback) of the quantity of the relevant material actually contained in the goods, and for the purposes of that paragraph the expression " the appropriate allowance" means the allowance

1950

Finance A, 1950

Ch. 15

229

equivalent to the average rate of wastage of the relevant material, either by manufacturers generally or by any particular manufacturer, in the manufacture either of all goods of the relevant class or description or of such goods of that class or description as are manufactured for export.

(3) Where any such scheme as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section provides different rates of drawback for different categories of the relevant material in accordance with paragraph (c) of that subsection and, in the manufacture of any goods in the case of which drawback is payable under the scheme, there has been used material of more than one of those categories, then (unless the scheme allows drawback only in respect of the quantity of material actually contained in the goods) the quantity of material in respect of which drawback is payable at each of the rates applicable in the case of those goods shall be arrived at as follows : —

(a) if the scheme allows drawback in respect of the quantity

of the relevant material actually contained in the goods together with such additional quantity as is mentioned in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section, the said additional quantity shall be deemed to be material of the same categories, and in the same proportions, as the relevant material actually contained in the goods (excluding any such material which is not duty paid);

(b) if the scheme allows drawback in respect of the average

quantity of the relevant material used in manufacture as provided for by paragraph (£>) of subsection (2) of the said section nine of the Finance Act, 1932, the quantity in respect of which drawback may be allowed at the rate applicable to any category shall be the quantity of duty-paid material of that category which is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners to have been used in the manufacture of the goods, but so that this paragraph shall not affect the total quantity of material in respect of which the drawback may be allowed and, where it would otherwise have that effect, the quantity in respect of which drawback would be payable at a lower rate shall be increased or reduced as the case may require, in preference to the quantity in respect of which it would be payable at a higher rate.

(4) In subsection (1) of this section the expression " import duties" means any of the following duties of customs, namely—

(a) the duties chargeable under Part I of the Import Duties Act, 1932;

(b) the duties chargeable under section one of the Ottawa Agreements Act, 1932;

and any reference in this section to section nine of the Finance Act, 1932, shall accordingly include that section as applied by subsequent enactments to the duties mentioned in paragraphs (b) to \e) of this subsection.

13.—(1) The Vehicles (Excise) Act, 1949, shall have effect as if subsection (2) of section four (which sets out the vehicles chargeable with duty at the rates provided for by that section) were amended as directed by the next following subsection of this section, and accordingly read as set out in the Third Schedule to this Act.

(2) The amendments to be made in the said subsection (2) are as follows—

(b) the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, in the case of an assessment to income tax other than surtax, or the Special Commissioners, in the case of an assessment to surtax, are of opinion that, if an application for separate assessment under Rule 17 of the General Rules or under subsection (9) of section forty-two of the Finance Act. 1927, had been in force with respect to that year of assessment, an assessment in respect of. or of part of, the same income would have fallen to be made on, or on the trustee, guardian, curator or committee of, or on the executors or administrators of, a woman who is the said man’s wife or was his wife in that year of assessment; and

(c) the whole or part of the amount payable under the original assessment has remained unpaid at the expiration of twenty-eight days from the time when it became due,

paid by the notice; and

(iii) fell to be made and was made by the authority who made the original assessment; and

the same consequences shall follow for income tax purposes as would have followed if, throughout that year of assessment, they had been in fact separated in such circumstances that the separation was likely to be permanent:

Provided that where this subsection applies and the net aggregate amount of income tax (including surtax) falling to be borne by the husband and the wife for the year is greater than it would have been but for the provisions of this subsection, the Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall cause such relief to be given (by the reduction of such assessments on the husband or the wife or the repayment of such tax paid (by deduction or otherwise) by the husband or the wife as those Commissioners may direct) as will reduce the said net aggregate amount by the amount of the excess.

(3) The provisions of Part I of the Ninth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1947, shall, as respects unilateral relief, have effect subject to the provisions set out in Part II of the said Schedule to this Act, and any expression occurring in Part I of the said Ninth Schedule, or in subsection (5) of section fifty-one or subsection (5) of section fifty-two of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1945, which imports a reference to relief under arrangements for the time being in force by virtue of Part V of the last-mentioned Act shall be deemed to import also a reference to unilateral relief.

Provided that the condition specified in paragraph of this section shall not be deemed not to be complied with in the case of an Association by reason only that the memorandum or other similar instrument regulating its functions does not prevent the payment to members of the Association of—

and where (whether in consideration of an assignment or other wise) anything is obtained partly in respect of some debt, claim or property so written off as aforesaid and partly in respect of some other debt, claim or property, the amount or value of what is obtained shall be apportioned rateably to the amounts or values of the several debts, claims or properties and there shall be deemed to be a recovery in respect of the first mentioned debt, claim or property of an amount equal to such part of the amount or value of what is obtained as is apportioned thereto:

Provided that where the whole or any part of, or of the value of, something obtained in consideration of an assignment of rights in respect of any debt, claim or property so written off as aforesaid is treated as a recovery in respect of that debt, claim or property, all subsequent recoveries in respect of that debt, claim or property made by virtue of those rights shall be left out of account for the purposes of this section except to the extent that the total amount thereof exceeds or, as the case may be. exceeds that part of, the amount or value of what was obtained in consideration of the assignment.

(3) In ascertaining, under subsection (2) of this section, the amount of any recovery, there may be deducted from the amount or value of what is obtained any expenses incurred in obtaining it, and references in the said subsection to the amount or value of what is obtained shall be construed accordingly:

and the payments and repayments of tax falling to be made under subsection (1) of this section shall be adjusted accordingly.

(4) Where an amount of tax has been allowed to remain uncollected on the ground that some debt, claim or property might prove to be irrecoverable or lost, without, however, a deduction being actually allowed in the relevant computation of profits, profits or gains or losses, the preceding provisions of this section shall apply, with the necessary adaptations, as if a deduction had been allowed in the said computation so as to write off the debt or claim, or, as the case may be, the value of the property, to an extent corresponding to the amount of tax allowed to remain uncollected.

(5) In this section, the expression " enemy territory" means any area under the sovereignty of, or in the occupation of, a Power at war with His Majesty and the expression " at war with His Majesty" means at war with His Majesty at some time during the years nineteen hundred and thirty-nine to nineteen hundred and forty-six.

Provisions Adjusting Contractual Rights in Relation to Purchase Tax in respect of Road Vehicles

1. —(1) This Part of this Schedule applies to vehicles of the following description, that is to say:—

road vehicles constructed or adapted for use for the carriage or haulage of goods or burden of any description not forming part of the vehicle or necessary for its propulsion or equipment, being either mechanically propelled vehicles or vehicles designed for use as components of a composite vehicle which is mechanically propelled, and not being vehicles in respect of which purchase tax has become chargeable nor vehicles of the kinds mentioned in paragraphs (Z>), (c), (</), (e) and ( ) of sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 3 of Part I of this Schedule;

but applies to a vehicle of that description only where purchase tax would have become chargeable in respect of it if vehicles of that description had been made chargeable goods as from the first day of May, nineteen hundred and fifty.

(2) Any reference in this Part of this Schedule to a prospective liability by virtue of this Act to purchase tax shall be taken as a reference to a prospective liability to purchase tax arising from the charge of purchase tax on certain vehicles which was provided for by a resolution passed by the Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Commons on budget day.

(3) In this Part of this Schedule, the expression " relevant vehicle" means a vehicle to which this Part of this Schedule applies, the expression " budget day" means the eighteenth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty, and the expression " process of manufacture " has the same meaning as in section sixteen of the Finance Act, 1946.

2. Subject to paragraph 5 of this Part of this Schedule, where a relevant vehicle was sold in the course of a business under a purchase made after budget day and before the date of the passing of this Act at a price exceeding the price at which, in the ordinary course of that business, similar vehicles were sold or offered for sale immediately before budget day, the buyer shall be entitled to deduct from the price, or (if he has paid the price) to recover from the seller as money received

by him for the use of the buyer, an amount equal to the excess, except in so far as the seller proves that the excess was included in the price by reference to matters other than—

(a) his prospective liability by virtue of this Act to purchase tax in respect of the vehicle; or

(b) any increase attributable to the prospective liability as aforesaid of any other person in the price charged to the seller on a contract made by him after budget day for the purchase of the vehicle or for the application of a process of manufacture resulting in the vehicle.

3. Subject as aforesaid, where a relevant vehicle was sold under a purchase made on or before budget day and was delivered under the purchase on or after the first day of May, nineteen hundred and fifty, but before the date of the passing of this Act, and the seller has recovered from the buyer, as an addition to the price, any sum fixed by reference to his prospective liability by virtue of this Act to purchase tax in respect of the vehicle, the buyer shall be entitled to recover that sum from the seller as money received by him for the use of the buyer.

4. The two last foregoing paragraphs shall apply where a contract (not being a contract of sale) was made for the application of a process of manufacture resulting in a relevant vehicle, as they would have applied if the contract had been a contract for the sale of the vehicle to the person to whose order the process is applied by the person applying it to his order, but with the substitution—

(a) in paragraph 2 for the reference to similar vehicles being sold or offered for sale of a reference to contracts for similar operations being made or invited; and

(b) in paragraph 3 for the reference to the vehicle being delivered of a reference to the process being completed.

5.—(1) Where, in the case of a relevant vehicle, a transaction giving rise to any such prospective liability to purchase tax as is referred to in the foregoing provisions of this Part of this Schedule was one by reason of which purchase tax is chargeable in respect of the vehicle’s chassis, any amount which apart from this paragraph might be deducted or recovered under those provisions as referable to that prospective liability, or to an increase of price attributable to that prospective liability, shall be reduced by the amount of the tax so chargeable.

(2) A person shall not be entitled to recover under subsection (2) of section twenty-four of the Finance Act, 1948, any tax in respect of which he is entitled to a reduction under the foregoing sub-paragraph.

Provided that where the said next chargeable accounting period falls partly before and partly after the said end of March, the tax which would, but for this proviso, go to reduce the amount of the profits for the said next chargeable accounting period shall be apportioned between the two parts of the said next chargeable accounting period, and so much only of that tax as is apportioned to the second part of the period shall go to reduce the profits for that period.

(2) Where any such document is attested by a justice of the peace (or, if executed outside the United Kingdom, by a person of any such class as may be prescribed), the document shall be admissible as aforesaid without further proof of the signature of the person by whom it is executed; and for the purposes of this subsection, a document purporting to be attested as aforesaid shall be deemed to be so attested, and to be executed and attested on the date and at the place specified therein, unless the contrary is proved.

Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards signed at Geneva on behalf of His Majesty on the twenty-sixth day of September, nineteen hundred and twenty-seven

Article I

To obtain such recognition or enforcement, it shall, further, be necessary: —

(a) That the award has been made in pursuance of a submission

to arbitration which is valid under the law applicable thereto;

(b) That the subject-matter of the award is capable of settlement

by arbitration under the law of the country in which the award is sought to be relied upon;

[31st January 1940.]

WHEREAS the Bank of England, at the request of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, advanced sums amounting to ten million pounds to the National Bank of Czecho-Slovakia by way of opening an account (hereafter in this Act referred to as “the Bank of England loan account”) in the name of that bank and crediting thereto the said sums:

[2 & 3 Geo. 6. c. 6.]

And whereas in pursuance of section one of the Czecho-Slovakia (Financial Assistance) Act, 1939, the Treasury repaid to the Bank of England the sums advanced by them as aforesaid:

1940. Czechoslovakia (Financial Claims and Refugees) Act, 1940. Ch. 4. 3

it was agreed that the Government of the Czecho-Slovak Republic would regard the sums so repaid to the Bank of England as having been advanced to them by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom:

And whereas by Article 2 of the Financial Assistance agreement it was agreed that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would grant as a gift to the Government of the Czecho-Slovak Republic the sum of four million pounds by releasing the said Government from any liability in respect of that sum under Article 1 of the said agreement, and that the sum of four million pounds should be paid by the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic into a special account and disbursed in accordance with the arrangements agreed between the two Governments:

And whereas the sum of five hundred thousand pounds was paid on behalf of the Government of the Czecho-Slovak Republic into an account (hereafter in this Act referred to as “the Lloyds Bank gift account”) opened by Lloyds Bank Limited in the name of the National Bank of Czecho-Slovakia to assist the emigration of refugees from Czecho-Slovakia to Palestine, and certain other sums were disbursed on behalf of the said Government for the relief of refugees from Czechoslovakia:

And whereas in accordance with the arrangements mentioned in the said Article 2 the special account therein mentioned (hereafter in this Act referred to as “the Bank of England gift account”) was opened by the Bank of England in the name of the National Bank of Czecho-Slovakia and the sum of four million pounds, less the sums to be treated as aforesaid as having been paid into the said account, was transferred to that account from the Bank of England loan account to be applied for the relief of refugees from Czecho-Slovakia:

4 Ch. 4. Czechoslovakia (Financial Claims and Refugees) Act, 1940. 3 & 4 Geo. 6.

[2 & 3 Geo. 6. c. 11.]

And whereas under the Czechoslovakia (Restrictions on Banking Accounts &c.)

And whereas, by a deed made on the twenty-first day of July nineteen hundred and thirty-nine between the Secretary of State, the Treasury and certain other persons therein referred to as “the trustees”, a trust (hereafter in this Act referred to as “the Czecho-Slovak Refugee Trust”) was established for the purpose of assisting the emigration and settlement of refugees from the territory which before the first day of October nineteen hundred and thirty-eight belonged to the Czecho-Slovak Republic:

And whereas money has from time to time been advanced out of moneys provided by Parliament to the trustees of the said trust for the purposes thereof:

And whereas it is expedient that the sums standing to the credit of the Bank of England loan account, the Bank of England gift account and the Lloyds Bank gift account shah be disposed of as hereinafter provided:

43

(c) policies of assurance upon human life, in respect of which there are separate premiums, effected with registered friendly societies other than collecting societies;

being policies of assurance for an amount not exceeding fifty pounds, exclusive of any bonus added thereto, which were in force immediately before the first day of September nineteen hundred and thirty-nine and in respect of which not less than two years’ premiums have been paid (whether before or after the passing of this Act).

2. — (1) In relation to any policy of assurance to Protection which this Act applies, being a policy of industrial from assurance or a policy effected with a collecting society, in

a notice served after the passing of this Act under section twenty-three of the Industrial Assurance Act, 1923 due to war. (which provides that a forfeiture shall not be incurred 13 & 14 by reason of the non-payment of any premium, unless Geo. 5. c. 8. default has been made in paying the premium within twenty-eight days after the service of a notice stating the amount in arrear) shall be of no effect unless, in addition to the matters required to be stated under the said section, it contains a statement in the prescribed form that an application may be made in writing within twenty-eight days and at a place specified in the notice to the industrial assurance company or collecting society, as the case may be, for protection from forfeiture on the ground that the default is due to circumstances arising directly or indirectly out of the war.

(2) Where any notice has been served in accordance with the foregoing subsection, the owner of the policy or any other person on his behalf may make an application in accordance with the notice, and if the company or society is satisfied that the default to which the notice relates is due to circumstances arising directly or indirectly out of the war, it shall endorse the policy, or serve on the applicant a further notice, to the effect that it is a policy protected under this Act.

behalf of the owner of the policy to the Industrial Assurance Commissioner (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ the Commissioner ”); and on an appeal being made in accordance with the notice, the Commissioner shall, if he is satisfied that the application ought to have been granted, make an order requiring the company or society to endorse the policy, or serve on the applicant a further notice, to the effect that it is a policy protected under this Act.

(4) Where an application under this section is refused by the company or society, the policy to which it relates shall not be forfeited unless a notice has been served under the last foregoing subsection and either—

(a) no appeal has been made and twenty-eight days

have elapsed since the service of that notice; or

(b) an appeal has been made and refused.

(5) Where an application under this section is granted, whether by the company or society or the Commissioner, then, subject to the provisions of this Act relating to the determination of protection, the policy shall not be forfeited for the default to which the application related or any subsequent default in the payment of premiums and no further notice shall be served under section twenty-three of the Industrial Assurance Act, 1923.

(b) where the policy is for the whole term of life and

is in force at the expiration of the period of

grace, then, if and so far as the said premiums have not been paid or tendered to the company or society before the expiration of that period, the amount assured by the policy shall be reduced by the sum produced by multiplying the amount of those premiums by the factor specified in the second column of the Schedule to this Act in relation to the age group mentioned in the first column of that Schedule, within which falls the age, on the anniversary of the day of his birth next after the expiration of the period of grace, of the person upon whose life the policy was effected, and the company or society shall endorse the policy to that effect or shall serve a notice to that effect on the owner of the policy; and

(c) in the case of an endowment policy which is in force at the expiration of the period of grace, then, if and so far as the said premiums have not been paid or tendered to the company or re the expiration of that period,

postponed by a period equal to that in respect of which the outstanding premiums were payable, and the period during which premiums under the policy remain payable after the expiration of the period of grace shall be correspondingly extended, and the company or society shall endorse the policy to that effect or shall serve a notice to that effect on the owner of the policy.

(2) For the purposes of the foregoing subsection—

(a) any sums paid or tendered in respect of

unpaid premiums shall be treated as satisfying those premiums in the order in which they fell due; and

of a free paid-up policy or of a surrender value is required to be ascertained, the provisions of the policy, or of any guarantee given in relation thereto, or of the Industrial Assurance Acts, 1923 to 1929, relating to free paid-up policies and surrender values shall have effect subject to such modifications as appear to the Commissioner to be necessary having regard to the failure to pay premiums during the period of protection and the variation of the terms of the policy under this section.

4. — (1) Where in relation to any policy of assurance an application for protection has been granted under this Act by the company or society with which the policy was effected, and the company or society is satisfied that the owner of the policy is no longer unable by reason of circumstances arising directly or indirectly out of the war to pay the premiums on the policy, it may serve a notice in the prescribed form on the owner of the policy to the effect that his protection will be determined after the expiration of twenty-eight days from the service of the notice, but that an appeal against the notice may be made within the said twenty-eight days by or on behalf of the owner to the Commissioner.

(2) Where an appeal is made in accordance with the notice, the protection shall not be determined pending the decision of the appeal, and if the Commissioner is satisfied that the notice ought not to have been served, he shall revoke the notice.

(a) the expiration of the period specified in the notice or the decision of the appeal (if any) against the notice, whichever is the later, or

(b) the date of the order,

as the case may be, but nothing herein shall be taken to prejudice the making of a further application for protection.

(5) Where in relation to any policy of assurance an appeal is made to the Commissioner and granted by him, whether under this section or under any other provision of this Act, the policy shall thereafter be treated for the purposes of this section as a policy in relation to which an application for protection has been granted by the Commissioner and not by the company or society with which the policy was effected.

6. — (1) Where in relation to any policy of assurance to which this Act applies a notice has been served before the passing of this Act under section twenty-three of the Industrial Assurance Act, 1923, but the policy to which the notice relates has not been forfeited, the notice shall be of no effect.

(2) Where a policy of assurance to which this Act applies has been forfeited on or after the first day of September nineteen hundred and thirty-nine and before the passing of this Act, an application may be made by or on behalf of the owner of the policy, within three months of the passing of this Act, to the company or society with which the policy was effected and, if the company or society is satisfied that the default in respect of which the policy was forfeited was due to circumstances arising directly or indirectly out of the war, it shall reinstate the policy and endorse it, or serve on the applicant a notice, to the effect that it is a policy protected under this Act, and thereupon this Act shall have effect as if it had been in force when the default occurred and an application for protection in respect of the default had been duly made and granted thereunder.

If, with intent to help the enemy, any person does, or attempts or conspires with any other person to do, any act winch is designed or likely to give assistance to the naval, military or air operations of the enemy, to impede such operations of IDs Majesty’s forces, or to endanger life, he shall be guilty of felony and shall on conviction suffer death.

2. — (1) Subject as hereinafter provided, persons charged with offences against this Act shall be prosecuted upon indictment, and if convicted shall be dealt with in like manner as persons convicted on indictment of murder:

Provided that—

(a) the provisions of the Naval Discipline Act, the Army Act, and the Air Force Act, relating to offences punishable by ordinary law shall, in relation to persons subject to those Acts, apply to offences against this Act, and the provisions of those Acts specified in the first column of the Schedule to this Act shall have effect subject to the amendments specified in the second column of that Schedule:

a direction being given with respect to an enemy alien the Army Act shall apply for the purpose of his custody, trial, sentence, and punishment as if he were, and had been at the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed, a person subject to military law:

(c) if upon representations made to him, it appears to the Secretary of State that any person sentenced to death after being convicted on indictment of an offence against this Act was, at the time of the commission of the offence, a member of the armed forces of the Crown or of the armed forces of any foreign power, including an enemy power, the Secretary of State may direct that, instead of being dealt with in like manner as a person sentenced to death after being convicted on indictment of murder, he shall be dealt with under the Naval Discipline Act, the Army Act, or the Air Force Act, or in the case of a person not subject to those Acts under whichever of those Acts the Secretary of State considers to be appropriate, in like manner as a person upon whom sentence of death by shooting has been passed by a court martial.

(2) No prosecution in respect of any offence against this Act shall be instituted, otherwise than by way of proceedings for a trial by court martial, except by, or with the consent of, the Attorney-General:

3. — (1) Notwithstanding any rule of law or practice, charges for any offences, except treason, may be joined with a charge for any offence against this Act in the same indictment or charge-sheet, if those charges are founded on the same facts, or form, or are a part of, a series of offences of the same or a similar character.

(2) Where any person is charged with an offence against this Act before a court martial and charges for other offences are joined in the same charge-sheet in accordance with the provisions of the last foregoing subsection, the court shall have jurisdiction to try and to punish the person charged with those offences notwithstanding that they may be offences for which that person would not otherwise be triable by court martial, and the Naval Discipline Act, the Army Act and the Air Force Act shall apply in relation thereto accordingly.

(3) A person charged with an offence against this Act who is in the United Kingdom may, whether or not the offence was committed in the United Kingdom or in any British ship or aircraft, be taken in custody to any county or place in the United Kingdom, and may be proceeded against, indicted, tried and punished in any county or place in the United Kingdom, as if the offence had been committed in that county or place, and for all purposes incidental to or consequential on the trial or punishment of the offence it shall be deemed to have been committed in that county or place:

(3) A deduction from a payment to which this section applies made on account of income tax at any time after the fifth day of April, nineteen hundred and forty, and before the passing of this Act which would have been a legal deduction if the provisions of this section had been in force at that time, shall be deemed for all purposes to have been a legal deduction to which all the provisions of Rule 19 or Rule 21 of the General Rules, as the case may be, were applicable; and the provisions of subsection (2) of section two hundred and eleven of the Income Tax Act, 1918, shall have effect as if this section had come into operation on the sixth day of April, nineteen hundred and forty.

“ (a) is immediately derived by a person from the “ carrying on by him of any trade, profession or “ vocation either solely or in partnership; or

“ (b) arises from any office, employment or “ pension.”

(2) In Rule 2 of the said Rules (which provides for the taxation of income arising from certain possessions out of the United Kingdom by reference to the sums received in the United Kingdom) for the words “other than stocks, shares or rents ” there shall be substituted the words “other than income to which Rule 1 applies.”

(3) The amendment effected by subsection (2) of this section shall apply both in relation to Rule 2 as originally enacted and in relation to the Rule substituted therefor in respect of possessions in Eire by Part II of the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1926, but nothing in subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section shall affect the tax chargeable in respect of the lands, tenements or hereditaments in Eire to which the proviso to the said substituted Rule 2 applies.

as is authorised by the said Rule 20 has been made, and the provisions of—

(a) section thirty-three of the Finance Act, 1924

(5) The Commissioners making any apportionment under this section shall hear and determine the case in like manner as they hear and determine appeals against an assessment under Schedule D, and the enactments relating to such appeals shall apply accordingly with any necessary modifications, but any individual who is, or but for the provisions of this section would be, entitled to relief in respect of the child shall be entitled to appear and be heard by the Commissioners or to make representations to them in writing.

(6) An apportionment may be made under this section notwithstanding that relief in respect of the child in question has already been allowed to hny individual, and if it appears as a result of the apportionment that the individual has been allowed too much relief, the amount of the excess may, if not otherwise made good, be assessed under Case VI of Schedule D and recovered from him accordingly.

(a) that there were no profits in the standard period; or

(b) that the profits of that period were so low that

it would not be just to ascertain the standard profits of the trade or business by reference to the actual profits of the standard period,

they may direct that the standard profits for a full year shall be ascertained as if the profits of the standard period were bf such amount or greater amount as they think just:

Provided that the said amount shall not exceed an amount equal to interest for the standard period—

(i) on the amount of the paid-up ordinary share capital, if any, of the body corporate, at six

If the person carrying on the trade or business is dissatisfied with any determination of the Commissioners under this subsection he may appeal to the Board of Referees.

(3) If on the application of the person carrying on the trade or business the Board of Referees are satisfied that the condition specified in paragraph (a), or the condition specified in paragraph (6), of subsection (2) of this section is fulfilled, and also that the paid-up share capital of the body corporate in the standard period did not fully represent the net value of the assets employed in the trade or business in that period, they may direct that the standard profits for a full year shall be ascertained as if the profits of the standard period were of such amount as they think just:

Provided that the said amount shall not exceed an amount equal to interest for the standard period at six per cent., or, in the case of a company the directors whereof had a controlling interest therein, eight per cent., per annum on an amount ascertained as follows, that is to say—

(a) by computing the value of the assets employed in the trade or business immediately before the commencement of the standard period (valued as assets of a going concern), excluding any investments which would not be included in computing capital under the provisions applicable to the computation thereof for the purposes of excess profits tax, and deducting borrowed money and debts existing immediately before the commencement of the standard period except so far as, by virtue of paragraph 3 of Part II of the Seventh Schedule to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939, they would not be deductible in computing capital under the said provisions; and

(4) If, on an application made under the last preceding subsection, the Board of Referees are satisfied that the trade or business belongs to a class of industry which, during the years by reference to which the standard period could have been selected, was a depressed industry, the Board—

(a) may give a direction under that subsection notwithstanding that they are not satisfied that the paid-up share capital in the standard period did not fully represent the net value of the assets employed in the trade or business in that period; and

Provided that where, before the passing of this Act, any tax has been paid by any body corporate under any assessment made by virtue of the subsections repealed by this section in respect of any chargeable accounting period, the amount paid shall be deemed to have been paid on account of such tax as the Commissioners may direct, being tax charged or chargeable under any assessments made or to be made on that body corporate, by virtue of the provisions substituted for those subsections by this section, in respect of any chargeable accounting periods ending not later than the end of the said period, and no repayment thereof shall be made except in so far as the Commissioners are satisfied that the amount paid exceeds the amount payable in respect of those periods.

In this subsection and the said Schedule, the expression “a group of companies” means two or more bodies corporate of which—

(a) one (in this subsection and in that Schedule referred to as “ the principal company *’) is resident in the United Kingdom and is not a subsidiary of any other body corporate resident in the United Kingdom; and

(c) no interest is payable in respect of the debt, but the circumstances in which the debt came into existence or is allowed to continue to exist are such that the debt represents in substance capital employed in the trade or business of the debtor body corporate,

the capital of both bodies corporate shall be computed as if the debt did not exist.”

(3) The provisions of subsection (6) of the said section seventeen (which defines the expression “subsidiary ”) shall have effect for the purposes of this section and the said Schedule as they have effect for the purposes of the said section seventeen:

Provided that a body corporate which, under the said subsection (6), is a subsidiary of two or more bodies corporate, each of which is resident in the United Kingdom and none of which is a subsidiary of any other body corporate resident in the United Kingdom, shall, for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section and of the said Schedule, be treated as a subsidiary of such one only of those bodies corporate as the Commissioners may direct.

(iii) that any income from any other investments of the co-ordinating body corporate or any of the controlled bodies corporate shall not be taken into account in computing the profits of that body corporate, except in so far as, if the trades or businesses carried on by all the members of the group were regarded as one trade or business, that income would be included in computing the profits of that one trade or business by virtue of any of the provisions of the said paragraph 6.

(2) This section applies in relation to any group of bodies corporate whether or not it is or includes such a group of companies as is mentioned in subsection (1) of the last preceding section, but shall, in relation to the members of such a group, have effect subject to the provisions of paragraph 1 of Part IV of the Fifth Schedule to this Act.

30. — (1) His Majesty may by Order in Council declare that-—

(a) under the law in force in any part of His Majesty’s dominions outside the United Kingdom excess profits tax is payable in respect of any profits in respect of which excess profits tax is, or, if there were no national defence contribution, would be, payable also under the law in force in the United Kingdom; and

(b) arrangements have been made with the Govern-

ment of that part of His Majesty’s dominions providing for the giving of relief from double taxation in respect of such profits in accordance with the following principles—

(i) that there shall be computed the amount of excess profits tax which would be payable

1940.

Finance A, 1940.

Ch. 29.

201

in each territory if excess profits tax in the other territory, and national defence contribution in the United Kingdom, were disregarded except in computing capital;

(ii) that such amount of relief from tax shall be given in each territory as bears to the lower of the two amounts so computed the same proportion as the amount so computed for that territory bears to the sum of the two amounts so computed; and

(iii) that where the amount so computed for either territory is found to have been incorrect (whether by reason of a subsequent deficiency of profits or for any other reason) the amount so computed shall be recalculated and the relief in both territories varied accordingly.

(2) Where any such Order in Council is made, then, if the Commissioners are satisfied that any case is one which falls within the arrangements to which the Order relates, they shall, in lieu of allowing, in computing profits for the purpose of excess profits tax or the national defence contribution, any deduction in respect of excess profits tax charged in the part of His Majesty’s dominions outside the United Kingdom to which the Order relates, make such adjustment of the excess profits tax payable in the United Kingdom or the national defence contribution as may be necessary to give effect to the arrangements, and allow any necessary relief accordingly by repayment or otherwise, so, however, that the effect of the adjustment shall not be less favourable to the tax-payer than the effect of allowing the deduction.

(3) Where under the provisions of subsection (2) of this section any adjustment of excess profits tax or national defence contribution is made for any period, a corresponding adjustment shall be made in computing for the purposes of section nineteen of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939, (which makes provision as to the relation between excess profits tax and the national defence contribution) both the excess profits tax chargeable for that period and the national defence contribution for that period.

(4) Where it appears to the Commissioners that, under the arrangements to which any such Order as aforesaid relates, any relief provided for by the arrangements falls to be recalculated (whether by reason of a subsequent deficiency of profits or otherwise), the adjustments made under subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall be varied accordingly and any necessary further relief given by repayment or otherwise and, where the effect of the recalculation is to show that too much relief has been given, any necessary additional assessments shall be made.

(5) The obligation as to secrecy imposed by paragraph 6 of Part III of the Fifth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1937, and subsection (2) of section twenty-one of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939, shall not prevent any authorised officer of the Commissioners from disclosing, to any authorised officer of the Government with which arrangements are declared by an Order in Council under this section to have been made, such facts as may be necessary to enable effect to be given to the arrangements.

' exceeding six thousand pounds, as is arrived at by allowing one thousand five hundred pounds for each working proprietor in the trade or business:

Provided that if, in the case of a trade or business carried on by a single individual, a partnership or such a company as aforesaid, the Commissioners, having regard to the nature of the business and the size of the business as shown by the value of the assets employed therein, are satisfied that the said greater sum is inadequate, they may, if they think fit, direct that there shall be allowed in respect of not more than four working proprietors such additional sum, not exceeding one thousand pounds for each individual working proprietor or four thousand pounds in the aggregate, as may be specified in the direction.

In this subsection—

(a) the expression ‘ working proprietor ’ means a proprietor who has, during more than one-half of the chargeable accounting period in question, worked full time in the actual management or conduct of the trade or business;

32. — (1) In computing the profits of any trade or business for any accounting period, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of expenses in excess of the amount which the Commissioners consider reasonable and necessary, having regard to the requirements of the trade or business, and, in the case of directors’ fees or other payments for services, to the actual services rendered by the person concerned.

(2) Any person who is dissatisfied with a decision of the Commissioners under this section may appeal to the Board of Referees.

33. — (1) Where a trade or business has been transferred by one person to another person, any buildings, plant or machinery provided for the purposes of the trade or business by the person transferring it which were transferred with the trade or business and continue to be used for those purposes after the transfer shall, for the purposes of paragraph 3 of Part I of the Seventh Schedule to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939 (which provides for an allowance for exceptional depreciation of certain assets) be deemed to have been provided for the purposes of the trade or business not only by the person transferring the trade or business but also by the person to whom the trade or business is transferred:

Provided that the amount of any allowance granted under the said paragraph 3 to the person to whom the trade or business is transferred shall, if necessary, be so reduced as to secure that the total allowances granted to the said persons in respect of any buildings, plant or machinery affected by the transfer are not greater than the total allowances which would have been granted to the person making the transfer if the transfer had not taken place.

The provisions of this subsection shall apply in relation to the transfer of part of a trade or business as

(2) Where, in respect of any accounting period, a deduction would, apart from the provisions of this subsection, be allowable in computing profits, and, in the opinion of the Commissioners, the deduction does not represent a sum reasonably and properly attributable to that accounting period, only such part of the deduction shall be allowable as a deduction for that period as appears to the Commissioners to be reasonably and properly attributable to that period, and any balance of the deduction shall be treated' as attributable to such other accounting period or periods (whether or not they include, or fall wholly or partly within, the standard period, if any, or any chargeable accounting period) as the Commissioners think proper.

Any person who is dissatisfied with a determination of the Commissioners under this subsection may appeal to the Board of Referees.

(3) In paragraph 6 of Part I of the said Seventh Schedule (which specifies the cases in which, and the extent to which, income from investments is to be included in computing profits) the following sub-paragraph shall be inserted after sub-paragraph (2)—

“ (2A) In the case of a trade or business part of which consists in banking, assurance or dealing in investments, not being a business to which sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph applies, the profits shall include all income received from investments held for the purposes of that part of the trade or business, being income to which the persons carrying on the trade or business are beneficially entitled,”

In this sub-paragraph the expression ‘ tax-free Treasury securities ’ means any securities issued by the Treasury under the power conferred by section forty-seven of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, or under the power conferred by section twenty-two of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1931.

Any reference in this Schedule to income which is by virtue of the provisions of this paragraph not to be taken into account in computing the profits of a trade or business shall be construed as including a reference to interest left out of account in accordance with this sub-paragraph.”

(5) The following paragraph shall be substituted for paragraph 10 of Part I of the said Seventh Schedule (which relates to deductions for directors’ remuneration in the case of companies controlled by the directors):—

no deduction shall be made in respect of directors’ remuneration.

In this sub-paragraph the expression directors’ remuneration ’ does not include the remuneration of any director who is required to devote substantially the whole of his time to the service of the company in a managerial or technical capacity, and is not the beneficial owner of, or able, either directly or through the medium of other companies or by any other indirect means, to control, more than five per cent, of the ordinary share capital of the company.

(2) If, in the case of a trade or business carried on by a company in any accounting period whijoh constitutes or includes a chargeable accounting period, the directors of the company—

(b) had during the whole or any part of any

previous accounting period which includes the whole or any part of any chargeable accounting period or the whole or any part of the standard period (if any),

a controlling interest therein, and the case is not one to which sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph applies, then, except in so far as the Commissioners otherwise direct, no deduction shall be made in respect of directors’ remuneration either in computing the profits for the first-mentioned accounting period or in computing, in relation to any chargeable accounting period wholly or partly included in that accounting period, the profits of the standard period (if any).”

34. — (1) If—

(a) the Commissioners are satisfied, as respects any assets of any trade or business the standard profits of which are computed by reference to the profits of a standard period, that during that period or any part thereof those assets were inherently unproductive; and

(b) an application that this subsection shall have effect is made by the person carrying on the trade or business,

then, in computing the average amount of the capital employed in the trade or business in the standard period and in all chargeable accounting periods, those assets, and any other assets of the trade or business, shall be treated as not having been assets thereof dining any part of the period during which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, they were inherently unproductive:

Provided that in the case of a trade or business the standard profits of which depend, directly or indirectly, upon a direction of the Commissioners or the Board of Referees under the second section of this Part of this Act or under that section as applied by the Fifth Schedule to this Act in relation to groups of companies, the provisions of this subsection shall have effect to such extent only as the Commissioners think proper.

“ (c) any other such deductions in respect of reduced values of assets as are allowable in computing profits for the purposes of income tax.”

“ The debts to be deducted under this sub-

paragraph shall include—

(a) any such sums in respect of accruing liabilities

as are allowable as a deduction in computing profits for the purposes of excess profits tax, or would have been so allowable if the period for which the amount of capital is being computed had been a chargeable accounting period; and

(b) in the case of the business of an assurance

company, also any sums representing profits of its fife assurance business belonging or allocated to, or reserved for, or expended on behalf of, policy holders or annuitants (being sums which would be excluded, under subsection (1) of section sixteen of the Finance Act, 1923, in computing the profits of the company for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts),

Part I.

Assessment of excess profits tax.

Ch. 29.

251

Provided that if the Commissioners think fit and the prin- fag qcb. cipal company does not object, one assessment for any particular —com. period may be made on the principal company in respect of the trades or businesses of all or any of the members of the group, but the amount of tax, and the incidence of the burden of tax, shall not be affected, and the Commissioners may, if they think fit, discharge any such assessment, and make separate assessments in lieu thereof.

3. Paragraph 1 of Part III of the Fifth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1937 (which, as applied to excess profits tax by subsection (2) of section twenty-one of the Finance (No. 2) Act,

1939, provides for the making, by the person who carries on or has carried on any trade or business, of returns for the purposes of excess profits tax of profits and other particulars of the trade or business) shall, as so applied, have effect in relation to any trade or business carried on by a subsidiary member of a group of companies as if the references in that paragraph to the person who carries on or has carried on the trade or business included references to the principal company, and shall so have effect whether or not the subsidiary member carries on business in the United Kingdom or is ordinarily resident therein.

Part II.

The group standard period and the group standard profits.

1. — (1) This Part of this Schedule shall have effect with respect to any group of companies existing in any period after the end of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine.

(3) The matters required by the subsequent provisions of this Part of this Schedule to be ascertained in relation to a group of companies, and the powers conferred on the principal company of a group of companies, shall, save as hereinafter provided, be ascertained and exercised once and for all in relation to each period after the end of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, during which the composition of the group remains unchanged, or is changed only by the loss or addition of a new subsidiaiy, and any such period is in the subsequent provisions of this Part of this Schedule referred to as a “ relevant period”.

2. — (1) If the trade or business of any of the members of the group was being carried on on or before the first day of July, nineteen hundred and thirty-six, the principal company shall select a period to be the standard period of the group.

3. — (1) If the group is one to which the last preceding paragraph applies, there shall be ascertained the standard profits of the group in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph:

Provided that the standard profits of the group need not be ascertained in relation to any relevant period if an election under the next succeeding paragraph has effect with respect to the whole of that period.

(2) The standard profits of the group shall, where the standard period of the group is one year, be an amount arrived at by aggregating the profits and losses arising in the standard period of the group in the trades and businesses of all the members of the group, other than new subsidiaries, and shall, where the standard period of the group is two years, be half the amount arrived at as aforesaid:

Provided that the second section of Part III of this Act shall, with the adaptations and modifications specified in the next succeeding sub-paragraph, have effect in relation to the ascertainment of the standard profits of the group as it has effect in relation to the ascertainment of the standard profits of the trade or business of a body corporate which is not a member of any group of companies.

(3) The said adaptations and modifications are as follows, that is to say—

(a) references to the person carrying on the trade or business

shall be construed as references to the principal company;

(b) references to the paid-up share capital of the person

carrying on the trade or business shall be construed as references to the paid-up share capital of the principal company together with so much as the Commissioners or the Board of Referees, as the case may be, think just of such park of the paid-up share capital of the other members of the group, not being new subsidiaries, as appears to them to have been, in the standard period, owned neither directly nor indirectly by the principal company;

(c) other references to the trade or business shall be construed as references to all the trades or businesses of all the members of the group, other than new subsidiaries;

(h) references to a chargeable accounting period shall be construed as references to a relevant period; but

(t) notwithstanding anything in subsection (8) of the scud section, on the termination of a relevant period—

(i) the Commissioners may, either on the application of the principal company or of their own motion, vary, as respects subsequent relevant periods, any determination in foroe under subsection (2) of the said section with respect to that period, whether given originally or on appeal, if it appears to them that the circumstances have materially changed, and any decision of the Commissioners so to vary or not bo to vary a determination shall be subject to an appeal by the principal company to the Board of Referees; and

(ii) the Board of Referees may, either on the application of the Commissioners or on that of the principal company, vary, as respects subsequent relevant periods, any determination under subsection (3) or subsection (4) of the said section, if it appears to them that the circumstances have materially changed.

(4) The references in this paragraph to the members of a group shall be construed as references to the bodies corporate which are members thereof in the relevant period, not being new subsidiaries, whether or not they were members of the group for the whole or any part of the standard period of the group.

4. — (1) Whether the group is or is not such a group as is mentioned in the last two foregoing paragraphs, the principal company of the group may elect that the standard profits of every member of the group shall be ascertained by reference to the minimum standard, that is to say, by reference to the sum of one thousand pounds, or, if the principal company is a company the directors whereof have a controlling interest therein, by reference to such greater sum as might be allowed in relation to the principal company under the provisions of subsection (2) of section thirteen of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939.

(2) The question what is the amount of the minimum standard in relation to the group shall be decided from time to time for the periods falling within the relevant period which are chargeable accounting periods of the principal company, and shall be so decided by the Commissioners:

(3) An election under this paragraph—

(a) shall have effect as from such date as may be specified

by the principal company in making the election;

Provided that if the chargeable accounting period is less than twelve months, the standard profits, as ascertained under those provisions, shall be proportionately reduced so as to correspond with the length of the period.

(2) The standard profits of the body corporate shall—

(a) where the standard profits of the group would have

been less if the trade or business of the body corporate had been left out of account in the calculation thereof, be taken, subject to the adjustment provided in sub-paragraph (3) of this paragraph, to be an amount equal to the difference;

(b) where the standard profits of the group would have been

greater if the trade or business of the body corporate had been left out of account in the calculation thereof, be taken, subject to the said adjustment, to be a negative amount equal to the difference; and

(c) where no difference would have been made to the standard profits of the group if the trade or business of the body corporate had been left out of account (whether because that trade or business was not in existence in the standard period or because no profits and no loss arose therein in that period), be taken, subject to the said adjustment, to be nil:

Provided that where the standard profits of the group are determined in accordance with the second section of Part III of this Act (as applied with adaptations by Part II of this Schedule), the standard profits of the body corporate shall, subject to the said adjustment, be such part of the standard profits of the group as may be determined by reference to an apportionment made by the Commissioners or, if any member of the group (other than a new subsidiary) so requires, by the Board of Referees.

or decrease in the average amount of the capital employed in the trade or business.

Provided that the proviso to the said subsection (9) (which prescribes that six per cent, shall be the statutory percentage in all cases in relation to any decrease of capital) shall have effect only in relation to such part of any decrease as is shown to be the proper proportion of any decrease in the average amount of the capital employed in all the trades or businesses of all the bodies corporate which are members of the group in the chargeable accounting period, other than new subsidiaries, and any question what is the said proper proportion shall be decided by the Commissioners whose decision shall be final.

3. — (1) If the group is not such a group as is mentioned in paragraph 2 of Part II of this Schedule or if the body corporate is a new subsidiary, the standard profits shall, unless by virtue of an election by the principal company under the said Part II the standard profits of the body corporate are to be ascertained by reference to the minimum standard, be ascertained in accordance with section thirteen of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939, and the second section of Part III of this Act, subject to the modifications specified in this paragraph.

Provided that on any such application for the confirmation of a direction the Board of Referees may, in lieu of refusing to confirm the direction, confirm it subject to such diminution of the amount specified therein as they think fit.

4. If by virtue of an election of the principal company under Part II of this Schedule the standard profits of the body corporate are to be ascertained by reference to the minimum standard, the standard profits of the body corporate shall be such apportioned part of the minimum standard as may be determined by reference to an apportionment made by the Commissioners, or, if any member of the group so requires, by the Special Commissioners:

Provided that if the chargeable accounting period is less than twelve months, the standard profits shall be taken to be the said apportioned part proportionately reduced so as to correspond with the length of the period.

5. — (1) If in the case of the trade or business of a body corporate there is a loss in any chargeable accounting period, and in that period the body corporate is a member of a group of companies, there shall, for the purposes of determining whether there is an excess or deficiency of profits, be deemed to be a profit of a negative amount equal to the loss.

(2) If in the case of any member of a group of companies the average amount of the gross capital employed in the trade or business of the member in any period is less than the deductions from capital allowable in that period, the average amount of the capital employed in that period shall be taken to be a negative amount equal to the difference.

(2) Subsection (1A) of the said section seventeen (which directs that certain debts not bearing interest which are due between interconnected companies shall be left out of account in computing capital) shall, if the bodies corporate concerned are members of a group of companies, apply in computing the capital of either of those bodies corporate only in relation to such debts, if any, as may be specified in a direction of the Commissioners.

(3) Where, in the case of any debt to which subsection* (1) or subsection (1A) of the said section seventeen would otherwise apply, no direction under this paragraph is given by the Commissioners, the debt shall not be treated, for the purposes of the borrowed money rules, or, as the case may be, of the second of the borrowed money rules, as borrowed money the principal of which is liable to be reduced by the value of any investments.

(4) Dividends received by a member of a group of companies from holdings of share capital of other members of the group shall, in all cases, be left out of account in computing profits, and holdings of such capital shall, in all cases, be left out of account in computing capital, but no reduction shall, in any case, be treated as made in the principal of any borrowed money by virtue of any such holding, either in computing profits or in computing capital.

2. — (1) In this paragraph, the expression “the borrowed money rules” means sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 0 of Part I of the Seventh Schedule to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939, and paragraph 3 of Part II of the said Schedule, and for the purposes of this paragraph a member of a group of companies shall be deemed to have an excess of excluded investments or an excess of borrowed money if and to the extent that the value of any investments which it has, being investments the income from which is not to be taken into account in computing the profits of its trade or business, exceeds or falls short of the principal of its borrowed money.

In this sub-paragraph, references to income from investments do not include, in relation to any member, income to which that member is not beneficially entitled.

(2) If any members of a group of companies have at any time an excess of excluded investments and at the same time any other member of that group has an excess of borrowed money, the borrowed money rules shall, in relation to that other member, have effect as if the reduction in the principal of the borrowed money of that member required by those rules were increased by the amount of the aggregate of the said excess of excluded investments:

Provided that—

(a) if there is more than one member with an excess

of borrowed money, the said aggregate excess of excluded investments shall be applied first in relation to one of those members, and if and to the extent that it is greater than the excess of borrowed money of that member, then in relation to another of those members, and so on; and

(b) the order in which those members are to be selected

shall be, first, the principal company (if it is one of those members) but, subject to the principal company

being the first of the members as aforesaid, shall be such as the principal company may require, or as the Commissioners may, in the absence of such a requirement, direct.

3. — (1) This paragraph applies to a subsidiary member of a group of companies which neither is resident in the United Kingdom, nor carries on any trade or business therein, and in this paragraph, the expression “the subsidiary member ” shall be construed accordingly.

(2) Where part of the share capital of the subsidiary member (not being ordinary share capital) is owned neither directly nor indirectly by the principal company, then—

(a) in computing the capital of the subsidiary member,

a deduction shall be made equal to the paid-up amount of that part of its share capital; and

(b) in computing the profits of the subsidiary member,

a deduction shall be made equal to interest on the said amount at the fixed rate per annum payable in the case of dividends on that part of that share capital.

(3) Where in any chargeable accounting period any part of the ordinary share capital of the subsidiary member is owned neither directly nor indirectly by the principal company, any excess profits or deficiency of profits occurring in the trade or business of the subsidiary member for that period shall be reduced by an amount bearing to the full amount thereof the same proportion that the paid-up amount of that part of the subsidiary member’s ordinary share capital bears to the whole paid-up amount of its ordinary share capital.

(4) The provisions of Part I of the Fourth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1938, shall apply for determining, for the purposes of this paragraph, how much of any share capital of a subsidiary member is owned directly or indirectly by the principal company, and shall so apply in relation to share capital of the subsidiary member which is not ordinary share capital as if it were ordinary share capital.

(2) The foregoing provisions of this Part of this Schedule shall have effect for the purposes of computing the excess or deficiency of profits of the trade or business of any body corporate in any period of charge if and only if in that period the body corporate was a member of a group of companies, but shall, for that purpose, apply to the computation of profits and capital during all periods of computation, notwithstanding that that body corporate was not a member of the group in or throughout any of those periods.

(3) References in the said provisions to a group of companies, or to a member, a subsidiary member, or the principal company, of a group of companies, shall be construed by reference to the facts of the period of computation, or, where there is more than one such period, to the facts of each of those periods respectively.

5. If at any time after the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, a body corporate is a member of a group of companies, there shall be made such alteration, if any, of the periods which would otherwise be chargeable accounting periods thereof (whether for the purposes of excess profits tax or those of the national defence contribution) as the Commissioners may direct.

6. — (1) Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, if a body corporate becomes or ceases to be a subsidiary member of a particular group of companies—

(a) no relief shall be given in respect of deficiencies of profits occurring before that event by any reduction of any profits arising after that event; and

(b) no relief shall be given in respect of deficiencies of

profits occurring after that event by any reduction of any profits arising before that event.

(2) If it is established in the case of a body corporate that it has a deficiency of profits for any chargeable accounting period during which it was a member of a group of companies, the principal company of the group may require that the deficiency, so far as it is not absorbed in reducing the aggregate amount of the profits chargeable to excess profits tax of that member for previous chargeable accounting periods, shall be applied in whole or in part in reducing any other profits on which the principal company is assessable to excess profits tax, and relief from excess profits tax shall be given accordingly; and to the extent that any deficiency is so applied, it shall not be available for reducing any profits chargeable to excess profits tax of the said member for any period.

The reference in this sub-paragraph to profits on which the principal company is assessable includes profits on which it is

(3) So much of any provision of Part HI of this Act as prevents a deficiency of profits being taken into account in so far as it occurs while the trade or business was being carried on neither in the United Kingdom nor by a person ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom shall not apply if the trade or business was being carried on by a body corporate which was then a member of a group of companies.

(4) For the purposes of this paragraph a group of companies shall be deemed to be the same group notwithstanding any changes in the members thereof so long as, and only so long as, the same body corporate remains the principal company of the group.

7. — (1) Neither section nineteen of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939 (which contains provisions as to the relation of excess profits tax and the national defence contribution) nor the Sixth Schedule to this Act shall apply in the case of any body corporate as respects any period during which it is a member of a group of companies, and the national defence contribution shall be charged in respect of any profits of the trade or business of the body corporate arising during that period as if there were no excess profits tax.

(2) The Commissioners shall from time to time make—

(a) such reductions, if any, of excess profits tax chargeable

in respect of the trades or businesses of the members of a group of companies; and

(b) such repayments, if any, of the excess profits tax paid

in respect of those trades or businesses,

as appear to the Commissioners to be such as will secure that over the whole period during which both excess profits tax and the national defence contribution are in operation the total sum payable by way of excess profits tax in respect of the trades or businesses of all the members of the group does not exceed the excess, if any, of—

(i) the total amount of excess profits tax which would be

chargeable in respect of those trades or businesses over that period if the national defence contribution were disregarded except in computing capital,

over—

(ii) the total amount of the national defence contribution

chargeable in respect of those trades or businesses over the said period.

(a) all deficiencies of profits occurring in its own trade or

business in those periods, and no deficiencies occurring otherwise, had been applied in reducing its profits chargeable with excess profits tax; and

(b) any credit to be given under the last preceding paragraph

in respect of the payment of the national defence contribution had been given in respect of all the national defence contribution chargeable for those periods in respect of its own trade or business, and no credit had been given for any national defence contribution chargeable otherwise.

(< a) in the case of the first chargeable accounting period in which the subsidiary member is a member of the group, of the amount calculated for that period under sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph;

(6) in the case of any subsequent accounting period, of the excess, if any, of the amount so computed for that period over the amount computed for the last preceding chargeable accounting period in which it was a member of the group;

and the subsidiary member shall comply with the demand:

Provided that if any excess profits tax charged on the principal company in respect of the trade or business of the subsidiary member has not been paid, that member may, to the extent that the tax remains unpaid, make payment in respect of the sum demanded to the Commissioners instead of to the principal company.

(3) If, in the case of any chargeable accounting period, the total amount of excess profits tax computed therefor falls short

(2) The excess profits tax payable in respect of the trade or business of a subsidiary member for any chargeable accounting period shall, in lieu of being deducted as an expense in computing the profits and gains arising from that trade or business, be deducted in computing the profits and gains arising from the trade or business of the principal company as an expense incurred on the last day of the said chargeable accounting period.

(3) The proviso to subsection (1) of the said section eighteen shall not have effect, but where relief from excess profits tax in respect of the trade or business of any member of a group of companies for any chargeable accounting period is given as the result of any deficiency of profits or any liability to the national defence contribution of any member of the group occurring in any chargeable accounting period—

CHAPTER 35.

An Act to explain and amend the Indian and Colonial Divorce Jurisdiction Act, 1926.

[10th July 1940.]

BE it enacted by the Kang’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1. — (1) For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that in considering, for the purposes of the Indian and Colonial Divorce Jurisdiction Act, 1926 (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ the principal Act ”)—

(a) what are the grounds on which a decree for the dissolution of any marriage may be granted by the High Court in England according to the law for the time being in force in England; and

(b) what are the principles and rules on which, in the exercise of its jurisdiction to make decrees for the dissolution of a marriage, and, as incidental thereto, to make orders as to damages, alimony or maintenance, custody of children and costs, the High Court in England for the time being acts and gives relief,

the amendments of the law relating to divorce effected by sections one to four, six and eight to ten of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937, have to be taken into account, and that references in the principal Act to a decree for the dissolution of a marriage include references to such a decree of presumption of death and of dissolution of a marriage as is authorised by the said section eight.

(2) A decree for the dissolution of a marriage granted under the principal Act before the appointed day shall not be invalid by reason only that regard has not been had to the provisions of section one of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937, and where before the appointed day a petition under the principal Act has been dismissed

which would not have been dismissed if the principal Act had been construed in the manner specified in subsection (1) of this section, the dismissal of the petition shall not prejudice the bringing of a new petition upon the same, or substantially the same, facts.

2. — (1) For proviso (c) to subsection (1) of section one of the principal Act there shall, as from the appointed day, be substituted the following proviso—

“ (c) no such court shall grant any relief under this Act except in cases where the petitioner resided in India at the time of presenting the petition and the place where the parties to the marriage last resided together was in India, or make any decree of dissolution of marriage on the ground of adultery, cruelty or any crime except where the marriage was solemnized in India or the adultery, cruelty, or crime complained of was committed in India.”

(2) For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that the provision in the said proviso (c) as originally enacted that no court shall make any decree of dissolution of marriage except where either the marriage was solemnized in India or the adultery or crime was committed in India did not operate so as to prevent the making of such a decree on grounds other than adultery or crime where the marriage was solemnized in India; and where before the appointed day a petition for the dissolution of a marriage has been dismissed on the ground that the said provision did so operate, the dismissal of the petition shall not prejudice the bringing of a new petition upon the same, or substantially the same, facts.

3. Where a wife has been deserted by her husband, and the husband was immediately before the desertion domiciled in England or Scotland but has changed his domicile since the desertion, a High Court in India shall, as from the appointed day, have the same jurisdiction under the principal Act as it would have if the change had not taken place; but, in any such case, the power conferred on the Court by proviso (d) to subsection (1) of section one of the principal Act to require the petitioner to show that she is prevented from taking proceedings in the court of the country in which she is domiciled shall

4. — (1) The following subsection shall, as from the appointed day, be substituted for subsection (2) of section one of the principal Act:—

“ (2) Where a decree or order is made under this section, the proper officer of the court making the decree or order shall transmit a certified copy thereof—

(a) if the parties to the marriage are domiciled in England, for registration in the High Court in England;

(b) if the parties to the marriage are domiciled in Scotland, for registration in the books of council and session,

and upon receipt of a copy of a decree or order purporting to be so certified and transmitted, the decree or order shall be registered accordingly.”

(2) In subsection (3) of the said section one for the words down to “ have the same foroe and effect, and ” there shall, as from the appointed day, be substituted the words “Where a decree or order has been registered in accordance with the last preceding subsection”, and at the end of the said subsection (3), the following words shall, as from the appointed day, be inserted—

“ and

(iii) nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing the taking of any proceedings in India under or in relation to any decree or order under subsection (1) of this section at any time after the making thereof.”

5. The foregoing provisions of this Act shall, with the necessary adaptations, apply in relation—

(a) to Burma;

(b) to any part of His Majesty’s dominions to which

the provisions of section one of the principal Act apply by virtue of an Order in Council under section two thereof, whenever made,

as they apply in relation to India.

(2) In this section, the expression “the appropriate area ” means, in relation to any court, the area with reference to which that court is for the time being a High Court for the purposes of the Indian law known as the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, or such other area as the Governor-General may from time to time by public notification specify, in relation to that court, as the appropriate area for the purposes of this section.

(3) The functions of the Governor-General under this section shall be deemed, for the purposes of the Government of India Act, 1935, to be included among the functions which he is, by or under that Act, required to exercise in his discretion, and so much of section eighteen A of the Interpretation Act, 1889, as provides that the expression “Governor-General ” shall, in relation to the period between the commencement of Part III of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the establishment of the Federation of India, mean the Governor-General in Council, shall not apply to this section.

house to which the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restric- (Emergency tions Acts, 1920 to 1939, apply, for leave to exercise any Powers) of the rights and remedies mentioned in subsections (1), Act> 1939» (2) and (3) of section one of the principal Act, being a right or remedy arising in consequence of a default in tenant or the payment of rent or mesne profits, or, as the case may mortgagor, be, in the payment of any instalment of or interest on mortgage money, the appropriate court, if it gives leave subject to restrictions and conditions, shall not make the leave conditional on any default in the payment of rent or mesne profits falling due after the date of the hearing of the application or, as the case may be, on any default in the payment of any mortgage money or interest thereon falling due after that date; but nothing herein shall be taken as prejudicing the power of the court, on any subsequent application for leave to exercise the same right or remedy, to vary the conditions or give unconditional leave, having regard to any such default occurring after the first application but before the subsequent application.

(2) Where the appropriate court, after the passing of this Act, refuses leave under the said section one to enforce a judgment or order for the recovery of possession of any such premises as aforesaid in default of payment of rent, or gives such leave subject to restrictions and conditions, the lease shall be deemed not to have been forfeited and shall continue in force so long as the judgment or order remains unenforceable, but no longer.

(3) Where the appropriate court, before the passing of this Act, has refused leave under the said section one to enforce a judgment or order for the recovery of possession of any such premises as aforesaid in default of payment of rent, or has given such leave subject to restrictions and conditions, and the judgment or order remains unenforceable, the person who, if the lease had not been forfeited, would be entitled to the benefit thereof, may apply to the court for relief from forfeiture, and the court may grant such relief and direct that it shall have effect so long as the judgment or order remains unenforceable, but no longer.

(4) Where relief is granted under the last foregoing subsection from forfeiture of a lease, any order made under subsection (4) of section one hundred and forty-six

of the Law of Property Act, 1925, vesting the premises or any part thereof in an under-lessee shall have effect subject to the relief so given.

2. — (1) It is hereby declared for the removal of doubt that on an application for leave to exercise any of the rights or remedies mentioned in subsections (1), (2) and (3) of section one of the principal Act, the appropriate court—

(a) in determining whether the person liable to satisfy

the j udgment or order, or to pay the rent or other debt, or to perform the obligation, in question is unable immediately to do so by reason of circumstances directly or indirectly attributable to any war in which His Majesty may be engaged; or

(b) in determining the restrictions and conditions

(if any) subject to which the leave is to be given;

may take account of other liabilities, whether present or future, of that person:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as affecting the provisions, of the foregoing section of this Act or as enabling the court to make the leave conditional on a failure to satisfy any such other liability.

(2) Rules made under the principal Act may provide for the service of notice of any such application upon persons, other than the applicant, having claims against the person liable as aforesaid, and for enabling such persons to be heard at the hearing of the application.

3. — (1) Where an application is made by the mortgagee of a dwelling-house for leave to exercise in relation to the mortgage or the dwelling-house any of the rights or remedies mentioned in subsections (2) and (3) of section one of the principal Act, and the mortgagor is a person serving in the armed forces of His Majesty or mainly dependent on a person so serving, the appropriate court, unless it is satisfied that the mortgagor is able immediately to pay the debt or to perform the obligation in question or that his inability to do so does not arise by reason of circumstances directly or indirectly attributable to any war in which His Majesty may be engaged, may in its

absolute discretion refuse leave for the exercise of that right or remedy or give leave therefor subject to such restrictions and conditions as the court thinks proper.

(2) Where at the hearing of any such application as aforesaid the mortgagor is not present or is not represented, he shall, unless the contrary is proved by the applicant, be deemed for the purposes of the foregoing subsection to be a person serving in the armed forces of His Majesty or mainly dependent on a person so serving.

(3) Rules made under the principal Act may provide that, in such cases and subject to such conditions as may be specified in the rules, the leave of the appropriate court to appoint a receiver of the rents and profits of any mortgaged dwelling-house may be given on the ex-parte application of the mortgagee.

(4) For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared

that subsection (1) of section one of the Possession of 2 & 3 Geo. 6. Mortgaged Land (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1939 (which c-108-restricts the right of mortgagees to obtain possession of land mortgaged before the third day of September nineteen hundred and thirty-nine) applies to any right to obtain possession conferred on the mortgagee by virtue of any attornment or other provision contained in the mortgage or in any agreement collateral thereto; and accordingly the said subsection shall have effect and be deemed always to have effect as if after the words “obtain possession of the land ” there were inserted the words “whether by virtue of his estate or interest “ as mortgagee or of any attornment or other provision “ contained in the mortgage or in any agreement collateral “ thereto.”

4. — (1) Subsection (3) of section one of the principal Restric-Act (which prevents persons proceeding without the leave tio? on of the court to execution on judgments and orders for the recovery of possession of land) shall have effect as if ooaa* after the words “payment of money ” there were inserted the words “or for the delivery of any property “ other than land by reason of a default in the payment “ of money.”

(2) Where the appropriate court refuses leave under subsection (4) of section one of the principal Act to take possession of goods let under a hire-purchase agreement or to execute any judgment or order for the delivery of

such goods, or gives such leave, subject to restrictions and conditions, and the hirer, before possession is taken or the judgment or order is executed, pays the hire-purchase price, the owner’s title to the goods shall, notwithstanding any failure to pay the hire-purchase price at the times required by the agreement, vest in the hirer.

5. — (1) In relation to any application under the principal Act for leave to enforce a judgment or order for the recovery of possession of land in default of payment of rent, the references in subsection (4) of section one of the principal Act and in section two of this Act to the person liable to satisfy the judgment or order or to pay the rent or other debt or to perform the obligation in question shall be construed as referring only to the person against whom the judgment or order was made and who is or would be, but for any forfeiture incurred in consequence of the default, entitled to the benefit of the lease under which the rent was reserved.

(2) On any application under the principal Act for leave to enforce a judgment or order for the recovery in default of payment of rent of possession of land held in distinct parcels under one lease by two or more lessees, the court may (notwithstanding that a single rent was reserved by the lease and the proviso for re-entry in default of payment of the rent was not severable) order that the application shall be dealt with as if those parcels had been held under distinct leases and applications were being made for leave to enforce separate judgments or orders in relation thereto, and may make such consequential provision as seems just for the apportionment of the arrears of rent, for the relief of any lessee from forfeiture of the parcel held by him and for the adjustment of the rights and obligations under the lease of the parties to the application.

(3) In paragraph (c) of the proviso to subsection (1) of section one of the principal Act (which excepts from that subsection judgments and orders under which costs only are recoverable) the expression “costs ” shall be deemed to include all charges and possession money payable to a sheriff in respect of interpleader proceedings taken by him.

An Act to remove doubts as to the extent of the powers which may be exercised by His Majesty under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939.

[1st August 1940.]

WHEREAS by the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, His Majesty was enabled to exercise certain powers for the purpose of meeting the emergency existing at the date of the passing of that Act, but the said powers did not enable provision to be made for the trial by courts martial of persons not being subject to the Naval Discipline Act, to military law, or to the Air Force Act:

And whereas by reason of the development of hostilities since that date it has become expedient to

[8th August 1940.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1. — (1) Subject as hereinafter provided, where any workman is at any time while this Act is in force entitled to a weekly payment by way of compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1925 (which Act, as amended by any subsequent enactment, is referred to in this Act as “ the principal Act ”), he shall, whether the accident giving rise to the compensation happened before or after the commencement of this Act, be entitled, in respect of each week after the commencement of this Act in respect of which he is entitled to the weekly payment, to—

(a) a supplementary allowance at a rate not exceeding five shillings a week; and

(6) in the case of a male workman who has children under the age of fifteen years, a supplementary

allowance in respect of each such child at a rate not exceeding four shillings a week for the eldest or only child under that age and for the second child under that age, and not exceeding three shillings a week for any additional child under that age.

(2) .Where the weekly payment is in respect of total incapacity or equals the amount which would be payable to the workman in the case of total incapacity resulting from the injury, any such allowance shall be the maximum allowance specified in the foregoing subsection, and in any other case shall bear the same proportion to the maximum allowance as the weekly payment bears to the amount of the weekly payment which would be payable to the workman in the case of total incapacity:

Provided that the total amount of the supplementary allowances payable in respect of any weekly payment shall not exceed such sum as would, together with the said weekly payment, amount—

(a) in the case of total incapacity, to seven-eighths of the average weekly earnings of the workman before the accident, calculated in like manner as for the purpose of ascertaining the weekly payment; or

(b) in the case of partial incapacity, to seven-eighths of the difference between the amount of the said average weekly earnings of the workman before the accident and the average weekly amount which he is earning or is able to earn in some suitable employment or business after the accident.

Any reference in this subsection to the average weekly earnings of the workman before the accident shall be construed, in a case where the amount of the weekly payment is increased as a result of a review under subsection (2) of section eleven of the principal Act, as a reference to the weekly sum which he would probably have been earning at the date of the review if he had remained uninjured.

(3) The supplementary allowances shall be deemed to be part of the said weekly payment for all purposes except—

(a) the calculation of the compensation payable in a case where death results from the injury;

(ii) in the case where the operations were necessary to secure protection from flooding, the Secretary of State shall require the expense to be paid in such proportions as in all the circumstances shall seem just by the owners of any lands to whom benefit has accrued or is expected to accrue in consequence of the carrying out of the operations, and no part of such expense shall be recoverable from the person on whom the notice was served if no benefit has so accrued or is expected so to accrue to him, and

(iii) any person required to pay the whole or any part of such expense may, within fourteen days after being so required, appeal to the Scottish Land Court against the requirement/'

(3) Subsection (10) of the aforesaid section shall have effect as if after the word “any ", in the first place where that word occurs, the word “river " were inserted.

(4) There shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament any increase attributable to the passing
